Both pesticides induced a dose-dependent increase but only TPTH induced a significant increase in MN at the highest dose (150 ng/ml) tested in CHO cells. With adding S 9 microsomal fractions, both pesticides induced a meaningful <b>MN</b> <b>induction</b> at 150 ng/ml and a dose-dependent significant increase in SCE. In vivo <b>MN</b> <b>induction</b> in erythrocytes was conducted by treating BALB/c mice orally or intraperitoneally with these pesticides either in a single or triple treatments. Oral gavage (p. o.) of TPTA resulted in a dose-related significant increase of <b>MN</b> <b>induction</b> in peripheral blood and of TPTH induced a significant increase in micronucleated reticulocyte (MNRETs) only in a single treatment. Intraperitoneal administration of TPTA or TPTH, however, resulted in meaningless random increases in MN though these increases might be attributable to toxic effects. The MNRETs levels in the treatment with both pesticides were independent to the sampling time. This study demonstrated that TPTA and TPTH was potential chromosome mutagens.

40|$|Isopropyl methanesulfonate (IPMS) is {{the most}} potent {{genotoxic}} compound among methanesulfonic acid esters. The genotoxic potential of alkyl sulfonate esters {{is believed to be}} due to their alkylating ability of the O 6 position of guanine. Understanding the primary repair pathway activated in response to IPMS-induced DNA damage is important to profile the genotoxic potential of IPMS. In the present study, both chicken DT 40 and human TK 6 cell-based DNA damage response (DDR) assays revealed that dysfunction of the FANC pathway resulted in higher sensitivity to IPMS compared to EMS or MMS. O 6 -alkyl dG is primarily repaired by methyl guanine methyltransferase (MGMT), while isopropyl dG is less likely to be a substrate for MGMT. Comparison of the cytotoxic potential of IPMS and its isomer n-propyl methanesulfonate (nPMS) revealed that the isopropyl moiety avoids recognition by MGMT and leads to higher cytotoxicity. Next, the micronucleus (MN) assay showed that FANC deficiency increases the sensitivity of DT 40 cells to <b>MN</b> <b>induction</b> by IPMS. Pretreatment with O 6 -benzyl guanine (OBG), an inhibitor of MGMT, increased the MN frequency in DT 40 cells treated with nPMS, but not IPMS. Lastly, IPMS induced more double strand breaks in FANC-deficient cells compared to wild-type cells in a time-dependent manner. All together, these results suggest that IPMS-derived O 6 - isopropyl dG escapes recognition by MGMT, and the unrepaired DNA damage leads to double strand breaks, resulting in <b>MN</b> <b>induction.</b> FANC, therefore, plays a pivotal role in preventing <b>MN</b> <b>induction</b> and cell death caused by IPMS...|$|R

Also, cells exposed only to AN were assayed for cytotoxicity and mutagenicity. A dosage up to 10 mu g/ml of AN was devoid of mutagenic activity. Protective effects were seen on micronuclei induced by B(a) P and DXR using pre and simultaneous treatment, but AN had no significant effect on <b>MN</b> <b>induction</b> by MMS in any of the protocols.

Cells were assayed for MN formation employing automated image analysis (MetaSystems, Germany). The γ-H 2 AX foci, {{as a measure of}} DNA double-strand-breaks (dsb), were quantified by measuring the mean overall signal intensity of foci per cell using flow cytometry and by counting the number of individual foci with a fluorescence microscope. γ-H 2 AX foci number per cell showed a much more pronounced increase after exposure to I- 123 -UdR per dose unit when compared to γ- and α-irradiation. However, the mean intensity of total foci signal per cell, as measured by flow cytometry, was very similar for exposure to I- 123 -UdR and α-particles. Single γ-H 2 AX foci induced by I- 123 -UdR appeared to be smaller and/or less intense stained than those after α-irradiation and resembled foci induced by γ-rays. The distribution of the cellular γ-H 2 AX fluorescence signals showed that the dose distribution of single cells was more heterogenous after exposure to I- 123 -UdR and α-particles when compared to γ-irradiation. <b>MN</b> <b>induction</b> was almost identical for all three investigated radiation qualities. γ-H 2 AX foci are very efficiently induced by I- 123 -UdR per unit dose when compared to γ- and α-radiation, probably because almost every I- 123 decay occurred within the DNA. The presumed complexity of DNA-lesions caused by DNA-associated AEE is neither reflected in size nor intensity of individual foci. The microscopic quantification of γ-H 2 AX foci indicates that I- 123 induced dsb are less prone to be transferred into an <b>MN.</b> The <b>MN</b> <b>induction</b> after exposure to I- 123 -UdR and α-particles could be underestimated because highly damaged cells within the heterogenous exposed cell population are not adequately represented in the MN assay.

Although neither MnP activity nor associated protein is detectable in H 2 O 2 -induced cultures grown in the absence of <b>Mn,</b> simultaneous <b>induction</b> with <b>Mn</b> and H 2 O 2 results in a 1. 6 -fold increase in MnP activity compared with the MnP activity resulting from <b>Mn</b> <b>induction</b> alone. In the presence of Mn, purging of low-nitrogen cultures with 100 % O 2, in contrast to incubation under air, results in an increase in the accumulation of mnp mRNA and a 13 -fold increase in MnP activity on day 5. However, in contrast to the effects of H 2 O 2 and heat shock, O 2 purging of Mn-deficient cultures results in negligible accumulation of mnp mRNA...|$|R

40|$|A mutant of E. coli (designated the STS mutant) {{has been}} {{isolated}} {{in which the}} phage induction and error-prone DNA repair pathways appear to be expressed constitutively without the cells having received an inducing signal. Phage lambda {{was not able to}} lysogenize this mutant, whereas a noninducible mutant of lambda, lambdacIind-, known to synthesize a repressor that is insensitive to the <b>induction</b> <b>mechanism,</b> lysogenized it normally. This result suggested that normal phage repressor was synthesized in the STS mutant but was then inactivated by the <b>induction</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The STS strain also had mutator characteristics, and showed spontaneous, error-prone repair of UV-damaged phage lambda. Derived from a lexA tif sfiA parent strain, the STS mutant carried an additional mutation spr at the lexA locus that resulted in a high level of expression of the induction pathways. The properties of this and related strains provide additional evidence that induction of phage and induction of error-prone DNA repair occur by a similar mechanism, and further suggest a model for the regulation of these pathways...|$|R
40|$|Part I of {{this paper}} {{described}} the community unit {{as one of the}} indirect and implicit means we employ in specifying the behavior of a proposed learning system. It has been pointed out that, for complex problems, the community unit's vision tends to be too narrow and restricted because of its piecemeal manner of attacking problems. This second part of the paper describes a planning mechanism which attempts to overcome this difficulty by taking a larger view of a given task. After surveying the task in general, the planning mechanism subdivides the task into a hierarchy of subtasks each by itself presumably easier to perform than the original task. This hierarchy of subtasks comprises a rough sketch of a possible course of action which guides the community unit. To manage classes of problems and to make efficient use of past experience, an <b>induction</b> <b>mechanism</b> is proposed. The <b>induction</b> <b>mechanism</b> will take a still larger view by considering the system's past experience with various problems and by attempting to apply that experience to related problems which have not previously been encountered...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe cell {{interactions}} that specify the spatial pattern of vulval precursor cell (VPC) fates differ between the nematodes Oscheius tipulae CEW 1 and Caenorhabditis elegans. In the former, the centered pattern of fates is obtained by two successive inductions from the gonadal anchor cell, {{whereas in the}} latter, a single inductive step by the anchor cell (EGF–Ras–MAP kinase pathway) {{can act as a}} morphogen and is reinforced by lateral signaling between the vulval precursors (Notch pathway). We performed a genetic screen for vulva mutants in O. tipulae CEW 1. Here we present the mutants that specifically affect the vulval <b>induction</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Phenotypic and epistatic analyses of these mutants show that both vulval induction steps share common components, one of which appears to be MEK kinase(s). Moreover, the inductive pathway (including MEK kinase) influences the competence of the vulval precursor cells and more strikingly their division pattern as well, irrespective of their vulval fate. Finally, a comparison of vulval mutant phenotypes obtained in C. elegans and O. tipulae CEW 1 highlights the evolution of vulval <b>induction</b> <b>mechanisms</b> between the two species...|$|R
40|$|LmrR is a PadR-related {{transcriptional}} repressor {{that regulates}} {{the production of}} LmrCD, a major multidrug ABC transporter in Lactococcus lactis. Transcriptional regulation is presumed to follow a drug-sensitive <b>induction</b> <b>mechanism</b> involving the direct binding of transporter ligands to LmrR. Here, we present crystal structures of LmrR in an apo state and in two drug-bound states complexed with Hoechst 33342 and daunomycin. LmrR shows a common topology containing a typical beta-winged helix-turn-helix domain with an additional C-terminal helix involved in dimerization. Its dimeric organization is highly unusual with a flat-shaped hydrophobic pore at the dimer centre serving as a multidrug-binding site. The drugs bind {{in a similar manner}} with their aromatic rings sandwiched in between the indole groups of two dimer-related tryptophan residues. Multidrug recognition is facilitated by conformational plasticity and the absence of drug-specific hydrogen bonds. Combined analyses using site-directed mutagenesis, fluorescence-based drug binding and protein-DNA gel shift assays reveal an allosteric coupling between the multidrug- and DNA-binding sites of LmrR that most likely has a function in the <b>induction</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|R
40|$|Three benzene metabolites, {{hydroquinone}} (HQ), cathecol (CAT) and phenol (PHE) {{were studied}} {{to define their}} possible interaction in inducing micronuclei (Mn) in mouse bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs). HQ and CAT, administered separately, induced Mn while PHE showed no genotoxic effects. Binary and ternary mixtures {{of two or three}} metabolites gave different results, causing considerable increase or decrease in <b>Mn</b> <b>induction.</b> HQ and PHE, in binary mixtures, as well as PHE and CAT, increased Mn synergistically, while HQ and CAT interacted negatively. The genotoxicity of ternary mixtures was mainly the consequence of two metabolites: HQ and CAT. The maximal effect obtained is far below the <b>induction</b> of <b>Mn</b> consequent to benzene treament. These data suggest that toxic and genotoxic effects of benzene alone could be the result of more complex interactions among these and other metabolites...|$|R
