40|$|A “Safety in Numbers” {{effect for}} a certain group of road users is present {{if the number of}} crashes {{increases}} at a lower rate than the number of road users. The existence of this effect has been invoked to justify investments in multimodal transportation improvements in order to create more sustainable urban transportation systems by encouraging walking, biking, and transit ridership. The goal {{of this paper is to}} explore safety in numbers effect for cyclists and pedestrians in areas with different levels of access to multimodal infrastructure. Data from Chicago served to estimate the expected number of crashes on the census tract level by applying Generalized Additive Models (GAM) to capture spatial dependence in crash data. Measures of trip generation, <b>multimodal</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> <b>network</b> connectivity and completeness, and accessibility were used to model travel exposure in terms of activity, number of trips, trip length, travel opportunities, and conflicts. The results show that a safety in numbers effect exists on a macroscopic level for motor vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe European {{transport}} <b>infrastructure</b> <b>network</b> {{is considered}} as {{the lifeblood of}} European trade and society, and is commonly regarded as a shared heritage of great economic value. But it is also recognised today that this network is composed of many existing infrastructures that no longer fulfil the current functional requirements and today's safety and quality standards, and requires refurbishment and increased capacities, potentially relying on innovative technologies, components and systems. The ECTP (European Construction Technology Platform) reFINE (Research for Future <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>Networks</b> in Europe) initiative aims at the development and delivery of innovative design, construction, maintenance and upgrading concepts and solutions that promote and strengthen seamless transport links for passenger and freight, while keeping up with future technological trends. The REFINET European Coordination action is an instrument supporting the reFINE initiative: based on a sustainable research network that integrates relevant stakeholders’ representatives of all transport modes (road, railway, maritime, fluvial…) and transport infrastructure sectors. Its primary objective {{is to create a}} shared European vision of how the <b>multimodal</b> European transport <b>infrastructure</b> <b>network</b> of the future should be specified, designed, built, renovated, and maintained, and elaborate a SIP (Strategic Implementation Plan) that will define the innovation activities required to make this vision a reality...|$|R

Functioning of a society depends on numerous infrastructure functions offered by the range of <b>infrastructure</b> <b>network</b> collectively. If any part of the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>network</b> becomes obsolete due to any external or internal disturbances, the impact will be eventually felt within the community. Whether such an impact is felt at a local level or in entirety, that depends on the degree of dependency of the community on the particular <b>infrastructure</b> <b>network</b> and also the interconnectivity of that network in relation to other network. Thus, in any attempt to address risks and vulnerability within the community, {{the first step is to}} map out the interdependent <b>infrastructure</b> <b>network</b> and community dependencies on various functions drawn from individual <b>infrastructure</b> or the <b>network.</b> The multi-level community is highly fragmented especially in a social context. Such fragmentation is characterized by numerous roles that people play within the society. Dependency of every person in the community on the infrastructure functions in their respective business or social roles can be understood by investigating their associations with infrastructure functions and the underlying network structure. Thus, in an attempt to assess the risks and vulnerability, this research aims to develop a new methodology utilizing the social network theory. It has been hypothesized that risk and vulnerability of the community is based on their interactions and social ties within both the community and <b>infrastructure</b> <b>networks</b> structure. Relative impacts of risks of one person or unit on another in relation to community dependency and association of infrastructure need to be visualized before developing the objective risk management strategy. The applicability of the new SNA based methodology will be demonstrated using an institutional precinct comprising multiple buildings. The findings will add significant new knowledge for managing risks and vulnerability of the community within the built environment context...|$|R

The {{communication between the}} vehicle and the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>network</b> is based only on WiFi technology. The contributions of this work are two-fold: 1) the horizontal handover (between WiFi access points) and 2) the design and analysis of an <b>infrastructure</b> <b>network</b> (backbone network plus WiFi access network) deployed along the trajectory of the vehicle. In the first contribution, we pro pose a handover scheme, called Spiderman Handover, which describes the horizontal handover for an in-motion network (on-board the vehicle) considering a procedure to update the routing information of a bridged <b>infrastructure</b> <b>network</b> (OSI layer 2). We evaluate our proposal by means of simulation and we validate our results by experimental measurements. In the second contribution, we study theoretically the parameters of several chordal like topologies {{in order to build}} a backbone network for a linear access network. By comparing these parameters, we propose a backbone network composed by a combination of two chordal topologies. This backbone network provides a good balance between their deployment cost, number of hops to the gateway of the network and a reasonable resilience. Finally, we evaluate the integration of this <b>infrastructure</b> <b>network</b> and the handover scheme by means of simulations. Results showed that the proposed handover scheme works properly on the proposed <b>infrastructure</b> <b>network,</b> allowing the provision of a continuous network connectivity to passengers on-board trains, metros or urban buses.

We use subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPE) to characterize the strategies of players with sequential moves.
