40|$|Introduction/Aim. This {{research}} {{was done to}} establish recasting effects of nickel-chromium and cobalt-chromium alloys on the thickness of their <b>metal-ceramic</b> <b>interface</b> in making fixed partial dentures. <b>Metal-ceramic</b> <b>interface</b> determines their functional integrity and prevents damages on ceramics during mastication. Investigation of metal-ceramic samples is supposed to show if base metal alloys for metalceramics are successfully recycled without any risk of reduction of <b>metal-ceramic</b> <b>interface</b> thickness. Methods. The {{research was}} performed as an experimental study. Per six metal-ceramic samples of nickel-chromium alloy (Wiron 99) and cobalt-chromium alloy (Wirobond C) were made each. Alloy residues were recycled through twelve casting generations {{with the addition of}} 50 % of new alloy on the occasion of every recasting. Analysis Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) (Oxford Instruments) and Scanning Electon Microscop (SEM) analysis (JEOL) were used to determine thickness of <b>metal-ceramic</b> <b>interface</b> together with PC Software for quantification of visual information's (KVI POPOVAC). Results. Results of this research introduced significant differences between thickness of <b>metal-ceramic</b> <b>interface</b> in every examined recycle generation. Recasting had negative effect on thickness of <b>metal-ceramic</b> <b>interface</b> of the examined alloys. This research showed almost linear reduction of elastic modulus up to the 12 th generation of recycling. Conclusion. Recasting of nickel-chromium and cobaltchromium alloys is not recommended because of reduced thickness of <b>metal-ceramic</b> <b>interface</b> of these alloys. Instead of recycling, the alloy residues should be returned to the manufacturers...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{was established}} to predict thermal barrier coating life in an environment simulative of that experienced by gas turbine airfoils. Specifically, work is being conducted to determine failure modes of thermal barrier coatings in the aircraft engine environment. Analytical studies coupled with appropriate physical and mechanical property determinations are being employed to derive coating life prediction model(s) on the important failure mode(s). An initial review of experimental and flight service components indicates that the predominant mode of TBC failure involves thermomechanical spallation of the ceramic coating layer. This ceramic spallation involves {{the formation of a}} dominant crack in the ceramic coating parallel to and closely adjacent to the <b>metal-ceramic</b> <b>interface.</b> Initial results from a laboratory test program designed to study the influence of various driving forces such as temperature, thermal cycle frequency, environment, and coating thickness, on ceramic coating spalling life suggest that bond coat oxidation damage at the <b>metal-ceramic</b> <b>interface</b> contributes significantly to thermomechanical cracking in the ceramic layer. Low cycle rate furnace testing in air and in argon clearly shows a dramatic increase of spalling life in the non-oxidizing environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{adhesion}} of electroless deposited Ni on Al 2 O 3 ceramic substrates using sputtered and evapd. Ti-Pd activator films was studied.

Ti-Pd activator film were studied with SEM/energy dispersive x-ray, and static secondary ion mass spectroscopy. Failure did not occur along the <b>metal-ceramic</b> <b>interface,</b> but mainly in the alumina, and therefore {{the strength of the}} system is detd. primarily by the substrate material. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy and high-resoln. transmission electron microscopy were used to study the interface structure before failure. The oxidn. state of Ti at the interface was measured with XPS. This was carried out in the (sub) monolayer range by using a Ti wedge deposited on alumina with a max. thickness of 0. 35 nm. It is concluded that the strong adhesion at the <b>metal-ceramic</b> <b>interface</b> is caused by chem. bonding of the first Ti monolayer with substrate oxygen atoms. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|E

Materials and Methods: Forty-five bar specimens of each two commercially available base metal alloys Mealloy and Wirorn- 99 (were fabricated. Dimensions of each specimen were 15. 0 × 2. 0 × 0. 5 mm (according to the ISO 6872 - 1984). According to the surface pretreatments the samples {{of the two groups}} were categorized into three subgroups: With OHT only, with sandblasting only (with Al 2 O 3 of 110 μm) and with OHT and sandblasting. Application of commercially available Duceram porcelain in thickness of 2. 00 mm was applied over the surface of metal with the pretreatments.

Among them, transition metals ceramic diborides, in particular Titanium, Zirconium and Hafnium diborides, are members of a family of materials with extremely high melting temperatures, high thermal and electrical conductivity, excellent thermal shock resistance, high hardness and chemical inertness. These materials -Ultra High Temperature Ceramics (UHTCs) - constitute a class of promising materials for use in high performance applications, where high temperatures, high thermal fluxes, severe surface stresses are involved. However, the possibility to exploit commercially their peculiar characteristics often depends to a great extent on the ability to join the ceramic parts one to the other or to special metallic alloys. As the behaviour of a metal-ceramic joint is ruled by the chemical and the physical properties of the interface, the knowledge of wettability, interfacial tensions and interfacial reactions is mandatory to understand what happens at the liquid <b>metal-ceramic</b> <b>interface</b> during joining processes. Provided that a large number of ceramic materials are not wet (or poorly wet) by pure liquid metals, their wettability by liquid-metal systems can be significantly modified by using either non-reactive metallic solutes capable of adsorption at the <b>metal-ceramic</b> <b>interface,</b> or reactive elements, so that the energetic contribution coming from reaction (and dissolution) free energy release could contribute to lower the total interfacial energy of the solid-liquid system, increasing, at the same time, and thermodynamic adhesion.

These stresses were generated during the cooling after high processing temperature. The {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) mismatch of metal and ceramic phases led to significant amount of thermal stresses. In both the composites, the metallic phase was found to be under tension and aluminum-oxide phase under compression. Even though the magnitude of compressive stress in both the composites was similar; the two metal-phases had very different magnitude of tensile stresses. The difference in volume fraction, CTE, elastic stiffness and plastic flow properties led to this difference. The hydrostatic stresses were found to be predominant in both the phases. Finite element simulations were used to predict the stress distributions inside each phase and at the interfaces. A representative unit cell approach was considered to represent the composite.

Sandwich-like specimens consisting of two rectangular pieces of ceramic solid-state bonded by a intermediate metal layer and notched or precracked at one interface between the two materials are fractured in a three- or four-point bend test device.

The fracture behaviour of ceramic-to-metal joints with and without intermediate reaction layers is studied. Internal stresses due to differences in the thermal expansion of the constituents are reduced by microcrack formation. For polycrystalline material transitions a mixed failure mode is observed including both adhesive and cohesive fracture contributions. The fracture energy is influenced by impurity phases and by the microstructure of the interface region. Experiments with combinations of single crystalline niobium and sapphire indicate that the interface fracture energy depends on the crystallographic orientationship of the two crystal surfaces bonded together. It is shown that the work of adhesion is only a very small fraction of the interface fracture energy.
