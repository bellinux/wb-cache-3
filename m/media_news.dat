40|$|The {{number of}} {{recorded}} natural hazards has increased throughout {{the past four}} decades and recent events such as the L’Aquila, Italy earthquake and the Sichuan, China earthquake demonstrate the persistent threat posed by such events. When a natural hazard occurs, the ensuing disruption to society is more often than not captured and reported by the <b>news</b> <b>media.</b> Thus, the <b>news</b> <b>media</b> is a valuable source of natural hazard event information. However, much of the previous work utilising natural hazard <b>news</b> <b>media</b> has focused on manual collation and examination of printed <b>news</b> <b>media</b> on a country- or event-specific basis. The Internet allows for real-time communication and broadcasting of natural hazards information and provides an ever-growing archive of the temporal and spatial patterns within natural hazard event occurrence. Thus, an alternative technique of <b>news</b> <b>media</b> collation, using web-based <b>news</b> <b>media</b> sources, is presented throughout this study. Two web-based natural hazard <b>news</b> <b>media</b> databases were created and information pertaining to the temporal and spatial occurrence of earthquakes, floods and landslides over a five year period (2005 - 2009) was collated. This thesis will examine the data generated by both databases and will focus upon the understanding of the temporal and spatial variability in <b>news</b> <b>media</b> coverage of natural hazard events. Statistical analysis of temporal and spatial trends within recorded <b>news</b> <b>media</b> coverage of hazard events is presented. Analysis of long-term time series data is coupled with an in-depth short-term analysis of individual hazard event coverage. In addition to the statistical analysis of identified trends, this study will explore the characteristics of media response to natural hazards {{within the context of the}} wider socio-political climate. It is proposed that the geophysical processes involved within each hazard event type, coupled with event-specific characteristics (fatalities, location etc.), control the subsequent <b>news</b> <b>media</b> coverage of an individual event. A series of natural hazard <b>news</b> <b>media</b> models are presented to show the inherent differences within recorded coverage of natural hazard event types...|$|R
