25|$|On 2 January 1793, Barlow took Childers into Brest to reconnoitre {{the port}} {{due to the}} growing hostility between Britain and the First French Republic. Tensions had been {{mounting}} for months since the French Revolution {{and the opening of}} the French Revolutionary Wars the previous year between France, Prussia, Austria and Sardinia but Britain and France were not yet at war when Barlow entered Brest. Within minutes of his arrival, one of the formidable forts overlooking the harbour <b>mouth</b> <b>opened</b> fire on his diminutive craft with 48lb shot. One of the first balls fired struck a gun on Childers deck and split the cannon in two. Barlow beat a hasty retreat without suffering any casualties and reported the attack to his superiors. One month later Britain and France were at war; in his excursion to Brest, Barlow had received the first shots of a 23-year conflict.|$|E

500|$|Asturias shows how, {{under the}} {{conditions}} of dictatorship, characters slowly lose their human identities. The Zany, for instance, while fleeing the city, is described as running [...] "aimlessly, with his <b>mouth</b> <b>opened</b> and his tongue hanging out, slobbering and panting". Just a few lines later, the Zany is [...] "whin like an injured dog". In what is in part {{a critique of the}} book, Jorge Barrueto argues that [...] depicts Latin America as a whole as [...] "Other". [...] Everyone from the President to the Zany displays this [...] "otherness" [...] as they cannot be civilized. Dictatorship produces Otherness, by dehumanizing its subjects, but is also itself presented as barbaric, absurd, and no more than an [...] "imitation of the European ways". [...] Thanks to phenomena such as dictatorship, Latin America appears to be a land where [...] "Otherness" [...] prevails and for this reason Latin America cannot [...] "evolve" [...] or reach truly European levels of modernity. [...] For Barrueto, [...] "this narrative's goal is to prove that Latin American societies, though they are aware of the blueprint of Modernity, are unable to act accordingly." ...|$|E
500|$|In chapter 38, High {{says that}} there are many men in Valhalla, and many more who will arrive, yet they will [...] "seem too few when the wolf comes." [...] In chapter 51, High foretells that as part of the events of Ragnarök, after Fenrir's son Sköll has {{swallowed}} the sun and [...] his other son Hati Hróðvitnisson has swallowed the moon, the stars will disappear from the sky. The earth will shake violently, trees will be uprooted, mountains will fall, and all binds will snap – Fenrisúlfr will be free. Fenrisúlfr will go forth with his <b>mouth</b> <b>opened</b> wide, his upper jaw touching the sky and his lower jaw the earth, and flames will burn from his eyes and nostrils. Later, Fenrisúlfr will arrive at the field Vígríðr with his sibling Jörmungandr. With the forces assembled there, an immense battle will take place. During this, Odin will ride to fight Fenrisúlfr. During the battle, Fenrisúlfr will eventually swallow Odin, killing him, and Odin's son Víðarr will move forward and kick one foot into the lower jaw of the wolf. This foot will bear a legendary shoe [...] "for which the material has been collected throughout all time." [...] With one hand, Víðarr will take hold of the wolf's upper jaw and tear apart his mouth, killing Fenrisúlfr. High follows this prose description by citing various quotes from Völuspá in support, some of which mention Fenrir.|$|E

2500|$|Lucasfilm built animatronic suits, costumes, and puppets for the film. Because of {{the limited}} {{preparation}} time, varied [...] "ducks" [...] created for the film would explode or lose feathers, and multiple ducks were built with the wrong proportions. On {{the first day of}} shooting, the crew realized the poor quality of the effects when they found that the inside of the puppet's neck was visible when its <b>mouth</b> <b>opened.</b> Huyck repeatedly reshot scenes involving Howard as the animatronics were improved. Because multiple puppeteers were in charge of controlling different parts of the animatronic body, Huyck was unable to coordinate the shoot properly. In the opening sequence, Howard's chair is propelled out of his apartment by wires, which were later digitally erased by computer, an effect that was uncommon in 1986. The effect of the feathers on Howard's head becoming erect during the love sequence took months to prepare.|$|E
