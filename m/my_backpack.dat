I {{would also like to thank}} the many other professors at the Univer-sity of Michigan, including Drs. Nikolaos Katopodes, Aline Cotel, Huei Peng, Christian Lastoskie, and Jeff Cook, who provided tremendous perspective, insight and encouragement throughout my graduate education. I have been fortunate to have such strong mentors that have each played a pivotal role in shaping my studies. I would also like to gratefully acknowledge support from the U. S.

40|$|This {{is a time}} in my {{life that}} will remain framed in my memory. I know it even as it unfolds in present tense, the sharp {{contrasts}} of my daily life etching their strange juxtaposition onto my mind in permanent ink. It all began in earnest {{on the first day of}} vet school. Just the day before, I had actually felt like an adult and even had the proof: an apartment, a car, a husband, a food processor. Now, as I left <b>my</b> home, <b>backpack</b> on <b>my</b> shoulders and lunchbox in hand, I half-expected my mother to appear with the Polaroid camera in order to snap the requisite 2 ̆ 2 first day of school 2 ̆ 2 photo of me standing in the driveway. It didn 2 ̆ 7 t matter that the back of the picture would now have to read 2 ̆ 217 th grade 2 ̆ 2 or that my lunchbox didn 2 ̆ 7 t have any cartoon characters on it.

40|$|Twelve years ago, I hiked through Haleakala Crater with my rifle. Early Friday afternoon, the day I {{was to meet}} {{three friends}} that evening at the Waikamoi Preserve in the Koolau Gap for an {{overnight}} camp, I walked into a small herd of goats just off the non-maintained trail. As part of my duty in the crater was to eradicate these "threats to indigenous lifeforms," I killed maybe three ofthem. Because {{it was a short}} trip I carried a meat sack; I would carry the goat meat out the next day. I approached the most easily reached carcass, lay <b>my</b> rifle and <b>backpack</b> on the ground, and drew out my knife. When I touched the nanny, I realized she bore keiki. Although the National Park considered it a bonus to kill a hapai nanny, I viewed it as an aborted celebration...|$|R

40|$|The {{educational}} drama methodology is one {{in which}} teachers challenge their students to apply critical thinking and problem-solving skills when discussing real-world issues and situations. This is accomplished through the usage of several tools including puppetry and mask, pantomime, and A/B interviews. My project seeks to encourage teachers to apply this method by providing them with an educational drama backpack containing a handbook and the materials needed for each activity. The handbook itself acts as both resource guide and model unit for the educational drama method. The included unit, which has been developed and tested with a preschool class, examines four fairy tales as a way of learning about various character traits. Through the utilization of the fairy tale <b>backpack,</b> <b>my</b> project seeks to encourage teachers to learn about, try, and eventually incorporate this valuable methodology into their everyday lessons...|$|R
40|$|I {{constructed}} the Metronomad instrument to facilitate my ongoing {{exploration of the}} footstep as a basic epistemological unit. This portable percussive instrument assigns prerecorded or sampled sounds from the environment to each foot; each step triggers a sound, amplified through speakers that are worn as a <b>backpack.</b> <b>My</b> first performance {{in the development of}} this instrument took place at the crosswalk of 77 Massachusetts Avenue, where I performed for several hours during a busy time of day. For the duration of the performance the crosswalk's audible pedestrian signal sounded only when I walked. Each note of the "cuckoo" tone was assigned to one of my feet. In this way I provided the tone pedestrians rely on for safe passage, altered only in tempo. As I walked I attempted to match my steps to the pace of another person, thus modulating the tempo of the crosswalk tone by the pace of that person. Throughout modernity artists have treated the urban walk as an ideal site for exploration of new social, political and aesthetic roles. At this seminal site I propose through my project: a new mimetic epistemology rooted in sound and the body, rather than sight and the eye; a new spatial interpretation of the modern autonomous individual; and a confrontation with the politics of the panoptic gaze. by Kevin J.

50|$|My {{experience}} at MFAs {{was a very}} crooked road. I was writing about five years on my own, and I needed to go get some teachers. The first experience I ever had in a workshop was at VONA/Voices, the workshop for writers of color. I did it in San Francisco {{and it was an}} incredible experience. I studied with Chitra Divakaruni, and she encouraged me to apply to the University of Houston. It was a highly-ranked, incredible MFA program, and I went there for a year. It was in a transition period so eight faculty members left between when I accepted and when I got there. It was kind of a tough year. Houston was very much a literature program, and not reading for writers exactly, but reading from a critical perspective. I realized right away I didn’t want to do that. I know so many great writers who come out of there, I still have great friends from there, but I realized what kind of writer I was, and I don’t know, I love Faulkner, but I don’t wanna get into the themes of As I Lay Dying. I wanted {{to learn how to do}} multiple narrators. So I did a year there, I dropped out, I ended up at the London Film School for the summer. Then I went to New York State Summer Writers Institute and I met someone from Hunter. I’d never heard of Hunter. It was not really known at the time. Everything I said that I wanted in a program, she would tell me that’s what they had in Hunter. I remember getting in touch with Colum before I’d even applied. I’d just come back from India; I was sitting on <b>my</b> <b>backpack</b> outside his office door. He shows up and he says, you’ve got five minutes. And we talked for two hours. I knew right away that was where I was going. I only applied to Hunter, I got in, and those guys, Peter Carey, Colum McCann, Claire Messud, Nathan Englander, all so talented, but with no ego. We all know talented writers don’t always apply to being good teachers, but they were incredible teachers. Peter Carey, who’s won the Booker Prize twice, a living legend—we were all too scared to go into his office hours. Once I remember in his office I said, “Peter, I don’t know how to write scenes.” He thought I was kidding. When he realized I was serious, he gave this big sigh, and pulled around the chair from the other side to sit next to me. He took out a piece of paper and started drawing boxes, here’s the scene, here’s the character. Character A enters and wants something, and we got into it. They were so generous with their time.|$|E

Or your backpack’s going in the highway. ” He mock-threw it toward the 5 p. m. traffi c in front of our high school, and I lunged for it, grabbing a strap.

Although I have known Celia for a number of years, this was my first time meeting Jacqueline Ford Morie and Tracy Fullerton. Janine Fron was not at this event, and as such was not able to join us for the interview—although she was the first person able to comment on the interview after it was transcribed. Despite having just organized an entire symposium the day before, Celia was able to set up an interview room for us the morning following the event. After an initial break for coffee and pastries, and a quick check of the recording equipment, we began the interview… Cindy: I’m here now with Ludica and we’re going to go around and introduce ourselves...|$|E
40|$|With the {{completion}} of this document I have reached the destination of a journey that I have endured during the last four years. It {{might not have been}} possible without the invaluable contributions I was fortunate to collect along the way and for which I express my gratitude. First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. João Peças Lopes. He was the compass to my journey. His knowledge and guidance always pointed in the right direction. Since 2007, I have had the privilege to work with him and share his enthusiasm and devotion to engineering. His important contributions have led this thesis to fruition and provided it with reassurance and quality. I am also grateful to Prof. Manuel Matos for relieving the load of <b>my</b> <b>backpack,</b> by letting me work from home for the last months while writing my thesis, it really made a difference. I would also like to express my deep gratitude to my travelling companion Filipe Soares in the road to the PhD degree and to the MERGE project. Luís Seca, André Madureira and Carlos Moreira also accompanied me in some of the biggest challenges from the very beginning. Their experience, knowledge and critiques made it much easier. Several others joined me in the wa...|$|E
