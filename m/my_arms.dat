5|$|With {{a larger}} {{recording}} budget from Century Media, Opeth {{began work on}} its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström, at Studio Fredman in August 1997. Although Opeth had Méndez, due to time constraints Åkerfeldt played bass on the album. <b>My</b> <b>Arms,</b> Your Hearse was released to critical acclaim on August 18, 1998.|$|E
5|$|He {{pulled me}} in {{and pointed to}} the bed. His whole body was {{trembling}} violently. He was screaming there were two Mexicans hiding under his bed with long daggers. To humor him, I looked under the bed and when I rose to assure him there was no one hiding there, he staggered and fell, a dead weight, in <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b> I ran across the hall and called in a woman doctor, Dr. Haberski, to examine him. She pronounced him dead.|$|E
5|$|Opeth {{was formed}} in 1990 by vocalist David Isberg. He later {{recruited}} bassist Mikael Åkerfeldt {{without the consent of}} the other band members he previously hired, which resulted in the departure of all members except Isberg and Åkerfeldt. Isberg soon left, but Åkerfeldt decided to remain in the band and keep it in activity. For this he contacted guitarist Peter Lindgren, bassist Johan De Farfalla, and drummer Anders Nordin. With this lineup, they recorded a demo, which led to the band’s first record label contract. Candlelight Records signed the band. In 1995, Opeth released their first studio album, Orchid, and after more changes to the lineup, the band released Morningrise and <b>My</b> <b>Arms,</b> Your Hearse in 1996 and 1997 respectively.|$|E
40|$|When I raise <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> {{what makes}} it the case that <b>my</b> <b>arm's</b> going up is an {{instance}} of <b>my</b> raising <b>my</b> <b>arm?</b> In this paper, I discuss Aristotle's answer to this question. His view, I argue, is that <b>my</b> <b>arm's</b> going up counts as <b>my</b> raising <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> just in case it is an exercise {{of a certain kind}} of causal power of mine. I show that this view differs in an interesting way both from the Davidsonian 'standard causal account' of action and from accounts put forward by recent critics of Davidson, such as Hornsby, Alvarez and Hyman. © 2007 The Aristotelian Society...|$|R

25|$|My own “felicitous fall” {{took place}} when I {{was working on}} a new gym for Portland State College (now University). I was three stories up, walking along {{scaffolding}} with a bucket of clip-ties in <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> when I happened to step on a plank that went only halfway between two platforms. I woke up a few moments later, sixty feet below, lying on the concrete floor. I had landed on the bucket, which cracked three ribs, but that and the hard hat I was wearing saved my life.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E

25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b> Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E
25|$|Deathcore {{also began}} to gain {{moderate}} popularity in the late 2000s (specifically 2006 and 2007). Notable bands that brought the genre in the highlight include Bring Me the Horizon and Suicide Silence. Suicide Silence's No Time to Bleed peaked at number 32 on the Billboard 200, number 12 on the Rock Albums Chart and number 6 on the Hard Rock Albums Chart, while their album The Black Crown peaked at number 28 on the Billboard 200, number 7 on the Rock Albums Chart and number 3 on the Hard Rock Albums Chart. After its release, Whitechapel's album This Is Exile sold 5,900 in copies, which made it enter the Billboard 200 chart at position 118. Their self-titled album peaked at number 65 on the Canadian Albums Chart and also at number 47 on the Billboard 200. Their third album A New Era of Corruption sold about 10,600 copies in the United States in its first week of being released and peaked at position number 43 on the Billboard 200 chart. Furthermore, Bring Me the Horizon won the 2006 Kerrang! Awards for Best British Newcomer after they released their 2006 debut record Count Your Blessings. However, Bring Me the Horizon abandoned the deathcore genre {{after the release of}} this album. San Diego natives Carnifex, witnessed success with their first album Dead in <b>My</b> <b>Arms,</b> selling 5,000 copies with little publicity. On top of their non-stop touring and methodical songwriting resulted in Carnifex quickly getting signed to label Victory Records. Lastly, Australian deathcore band Thy Art Is Murder debuted at number 35 on the ARIA Charts with their album Hate (2012) making them the first metal band to ever reach the Top 40 of this chart.|$|E
