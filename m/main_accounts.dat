5|$|There {{are three}} <b>main</b> <b>accounts</b> of the battle, {{none of them}} contemporary. The closest is Polybius, who wrote his account 50 years after the battle. Livy wrote {{in the time of}} Augustus, and Appian later still. Appian's account {{describes}} events that have no relation with those of Livy and Polybius. Polybius portrays the battle as the ultimate nadir of Roman fortunes, functioning as a literary device such that the subsequent Roman recovery is more dramatic. For example, some argue that his casualty figures are exaggerated—"more symbolic than factual". Livy portrays the Senate in the role of hero and hence assigns blame for the Roman defeat to the low-born Varro. Blaming Varro also serves to lift blame from the Roman soldiers, whom Livy has a tendency to idealize. Scholars tend to discount Appian's account. The verdict of Philip Sabin—"a worthless farrago"—is typical.|$|E
500|$|Mackintosh's own {{expedition}} diaries, which {{cover the}} period up to 30 September 1915, {{have not been}} published; they are held by the Scott Polar Research Institute. The two <b>main</b> <b>accounts</b> available to general readers are Joyce's diaries, published in 1929 as The South Polar Trail, and the account of Dick Richards: The Ross Sea Shore Party 1914–17. Mackintosh's reputation is not well-served by either, particularly Joyce's partisan record which is described by one commentator as a [...] "self-aggrandizing epic". Joyce is generally scathing about Mackintosh's leadership; Richards's account is much shorter and more straightforward, although decades later, {{when he was the}} only member of the expedition still alive (he died in 1985, aged 91), he spoke out, claiming that Mackintosh on the depot-laying march was [...] "tremendously pathetic", had [...] "lost his nerve completely", and that the fatal ice walk was [...] "suicide".|$|E

Two <b>main</b> <b>accounts</b> emerged regarding this incident, known as the [...] "Zarqa uprising" [...] among other names, with one account having been advanced by Hussein and Western historiographers and the other by political dissidents and many in the Jordanian and Arab press.

50|$|In Egypt {{from early}} times, grain having an {{intrinsic}} value as food functioned, {{in addition to}} precious metals, as money. The regional granaries were used to store and loan the grain of communities, functions similar to banking services although not the same. Under the dynastic rule of the Ptolemies, the numerous scattered government granaries were transformed into a network of grain banks, centralized in Alexandria where the <b>main</b> <b>accounts</b> from all the state granary banks were recorded. This centralized administration was the first known governmental bank (according to de Soto), functioning as a trade credit system that transferred payments between accounts without passing money.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of the first system of environmental-economic accounting (SEEA) in 1993 (SEEA-1993) was a major step towards establishing standards around integrating the environment into national accounts, and subsequently, environmentally-adjusting or “greening” macroeconomic indicators such as GDP. While the SEEA-2003 and subsequent revisions being undertaken for 2013 have expanded the range of analyses within the framework, {{the purpose of the}} SEEA has remained the same. It is an accounting framework that records the stocks and flows that are relevant to both the environment and the economy. Its Central Framework comprises three <b>main</b> <b>accounts</b> that can be integrated with the existing United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA), and each focuses on a different aspect of the interaction between the economy and the environment: physical flow accounts; functional accounts for environmental transactions; and asset accounts in physical and monetary terms.|$|E

The move forced Massachusetts Attorney General J. Weston Allen to release a statement that there was little to support Ponzi's claims of large-scale dealings in postal coupons. State officials then invited Ponzi note holders to come to the Massachusetts State House to furnish their names and addresses for the purpose of the investigation. On the same day, Ponzi received a preview of Pride's audit, which revealed Ponzi was at least $7 million in debt.|$|R

5000|$|Throughout the torture, Brébeuf was {{reported}} to have been more concerned for the fate of the other Jesuits and of the captive Native converts than for himself. As part of the ritual, the Iroquois drank his blood, as they wanted to absorb Brébeuf’s courage in enduring the pain. The Iroquois mocked baptism by pouring boiling water over his head. [...] The Jesuits Christophe Regnault and Paul Ragueneau provided the two accounts of the deaths of Jean de Brébeuf and Gabriel Lalement. According to Regnault, the Jesuits learned of the tortures and deaths from Huron refugee witnesses, who had escaped from Saint-Ignace. Regnault went to see the bodies to verify the accounts, and his superior Rageuneau's account was based on his report. The <b>main</b> <b>accounts</b> of Brébeuf’s death come from the Jesuit Relations. Jesuit accounts of his torture emphasize his stoic nature and acceptance, claiming that he suffered silently without complaining.|$|E
