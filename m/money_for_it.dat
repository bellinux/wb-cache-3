Afterwards, they decide to visit the old Hardesty family homestead. Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) who talks about his family {{who worked at the}} old slaughterhouse. He borrows Franklin's pocket-knife and cuts himself, then takes a Polaroid picture of the others and demands <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo and slashes Franklin's arm with a straight razor. The group forces him out of the van and drive on. They stop at a gas station to refuel, but the proprietor (Jim Siedow) tells them the pumps are empty.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{probably}} in 1998, al-Nashiri {{is alleged to}} have joined al-Qaeda, reporting directly to bin Laden. In late 1998, he conceived of a plot to attack a U.S. vessel using a boat full of explosives. Bin Laden personally approved of the plan, and provided <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> First, al-Nashiri allegedly attempted to attack the USS The Sullivans {{as a part of the}} 2000 millennium attack plots, but the boat he used was overloaded with explosives and began to sink.|$|E

25|$|Later, Mr. Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter, {{explaining}} that Mr. Wickham had refused the living {{he claimed he}} was deprived of, and was given <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> instead. Wickham proceeded to waste the money and, then impoverished, demanded the living again. After being refused, he tried to elope with Darcy's 15-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her great dowry.

The symbolic meaning of the shape is referenced in the novel The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown. The monument is also the subject of Carl Sandburg's 1922 poem, [...] "Washington by Night". In the musical Hamilton, the monument is referenced in a song, as Eliza Hamilton collected <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to be constructed.|$|E
500|$|The Pawnee {{government}} has shut down {{due to a}} budget crisis. When Leslie (Amy Poehler) explains at a town meeting that a family concert featuring children's entertainer Freddy Spaghetti (Brian McCann) must be cancelled due to the shutdown, the citizens are outraged. Leslie visits state auditors Chris (Rob Lowe) and Ben (Adam Scott) seeking {{a way to keep}} the concert, but Ben insists there is simply no <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> When Leslie goes to city planner Mark (Paul Schneider) to vent about her situation and seek help, she is stunned to learn that he has taken a buyout and plans to join a construction company, partially in response to Ann (Rashida Jones) having broken up with him; she angrily calls him [...] "Mark Brendana-Quits". Meanwhile, Ann is struggling with her redeveloping feelings for her ex-boyfriend Andy (Chris Pratt). Later, Ann suggests to Leslie she should hold the concert at Lot 48, as it is not a park and therefore not shut down. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy finally reveal their feelings to each other, but April still rejects him, believing Andy still has feelings for Ann.|$|E

500|$|Mike Fahey, {{writing for}} Kotaku, called the game brilliant, and {{compared}} the gameplay, graphics and music favorably to their Metroid II counterparts. Siliconera Ishaan found the game impressive, {{and said that}} it stands out from other fan-made remakes. Sam Machkovech at Ars Technica said that the game would be a delight to people who liked Zero Mission, and that its quality and amount of polish put it on par with Nintendo's games. Zack Furniss of Destructoid liked the game {{to the point that}} he thought Nintendo should use some ideas from it in future Metroid titles. Jonathan Holmes, also at Destructoid, said that AM2R does a good job at filling the [...] "void" [...] left by Nintendo's lack of new 2D Metroid games, calling it [...] "even more of an extensive re-imagining than Metroid: Zero Mission was to Metroid 1". Gonçalo Lopes at Nintendo Life said that the game was a great way to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary and a dream come true for Metroid fans, and that he imagined people {{would be willing to pay}} <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> if sold on Nintendo's eShop. Matthew Castle at Nintendo Gamer called it an example of how to do a remake right. Tom Sykes at PC Gamer praised AM2R as a [...] "great game in its own right" [...] regardless of whether one had played Metroid II prior or not. NF Magazine Tony Ponce initially worried that the game would lose the [...] "eerie charm" [...] of Metroid II, but found it to be able to keep a high-tension feeling, as well as including new things for longtime fans of the original.|$|E
2500|$|After the Vietnamese {{invasion}} in 1978, the riel was re-established as Cambodia's national currency on April 1, 1980, initially at {{a value of}} 4 riels = 1 U.S. dollar. It is subdivided into 10 kak (...) or 100 sen. Because there was no <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to replace and a severely disrupted economy, the central government gave away the new money to the populace {{in order to encourage}} its use.|$|E
2500|$|Spain {{returned}} to Manawatu and Wanganui, but discovered chiefs now refused to sell {{regardless of the}} level of compensation, ignoring William Wakefield's attempt to distribute £1000 in gold and silver coins. Although the Land Claims Ordinance authorised Spain only to [...] "respectfully recommend" [...] the payment of compensation, he told chiefs: [...] "Your refusal to accept the payment will not prevent the land going to the Europeans." [...] He awarded the company almost all it had claimed and held the <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to be later claimed by Maori in those areas.|$|E

2500|$|Writing {{began in}} December 1976, with a first draft {{completed}} by mid-1977. The final pre-production draft was ready in January 1978, following [...] "a concentrated two-week writing and water-skiing period in Barbados". The film {{would not have}} been made without Python fan former Beatle George Harrison, who set up HandMade Films to help fund it at a cost of £3million. Harrison put up the <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> as he [...] "wanted to see the movie" [...] (this was later described by Terry Jones as the [...] "world's most expensive cinema ticket"). The original backers, EMI Films, had been scared off at the last minute by the subject matter, particularly Bernard Delfont. The very last words in the film are: [...] "I said to him, 'Bernie, they'll never make their money back on this one'", teasing Delfont for his lack of faith in the project. Terry Gilliam later said, [...] "They pulled out on the Thursday. The crew was supposed to be leaving on the Saturday. Disastrous. It was because they read the script ... finally." [...] As a reward for his help, Harrison appears in a cameo appearance as Mr. Papadopoulos, [...] "owner of the Mount", who briefly shakes hands with Brian in a crowd scene (at 1:09 in the film). His one word of dialogue (a cheery but out of place Scouse [...] "'ullo") had to be dubbed in later.|$|E
2500|$|Interpreting the {{prohibition}} of coveting in [...] (20:14 in NJSP) and desiring in [...] (5:18 in NJPS), Maimonides taught that any person who covets a servant, a maidservant, a house, or utensils that belong to a colleague, or any other article that the person can purchase from the colleague and pressures the colleague with friends and requests until the colleague agrees to sell, violates a negative commandment, even though the person pays much <b>money</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> as [...] (20:14 in NJSP) says, [...] "Do not covet." [...] Maimonides taught that the violation of this commandment was not punished by lashes, {{because it does not}} involve a deed. Maimonides taught that a person does not violate [...] (20:14 in NJSP) until the person actually takes the article that the person covets, as reflected by [...] "Do not covet the gold and silver on these statues and take it for yourself." [...] Maimonides read the word for [...] "covet" [...] in both [...] (20:14 in NJSP) and [...] to refer to coveting accompanied by a deed. Maimonides taught that a person who desires a home, a spouse, utensil, or anything else belonging to a colleague that the person can acquire violates a negative commandment when the person thinks in the person's heart how {{it might be possible to}} acquire this thing from the colleague. Maimonides read [...] (5:18 in NJPS), [...] "Do not desire," [...] to refer even to feelings in the heart alone. Thus, a person who desires another person's property violates one negative commandment. A person who purchases an object the person desires after pressuring the owners and repeatedly asking them, violates two negative commandments. For that reason, Maimonides concluded, the Torah prohibits both desiring in [...] (5:18 in NJPS) and coveting in [...] (20:14 in NJSP). And if the person takes the article by robbery, the person violates three negative commandments.|$|E
