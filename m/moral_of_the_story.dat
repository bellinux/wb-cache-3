I think that some people will love that discussion and some will not love it." [...] Jensen pointed out that Murphy does not say that Blaine will not question his own sexuality, but clearly [...] "decides he is, in fact, gay". Ausiello posted at about that time that Blaine was indeed who {{he was referring to}} in his original story, quoted from the same Out article as Jensen, and added a new one-sentence summation from Murphy on the coming episode: [...] "I guess the <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> is don’t play spin the bottle while drunk on wine coolers." ...|$|E
500|$|Largely silent until then, in 1904 both Seton and Roberts made small {{efforts to}} defend their brand of nature writing from its critics, mainly Burroughs. In the preface to his new book The Watchers of the Trails, Roberts {{specifically}} responded to Burroughs' criticism by carefully pointing out that his stories were [...] "avowedly fiction". However, he continued: [...] "They are, at the same time, true, in that the material {{of which they are}} moulded consists of facts". Later that year, Century Magazine published Seton's only public response to Burroughs' criticisms, especially those made in the previous year's Atlantic Monthly article in which the naturalist branded Seton the originator of the faulty genre. Seton's response was {{in the form of a}} lighthearted tale about a critic named Little Mucky—obviously meant to parody Burroughs himself—who climbs a hill called Big Periodic, only to throw mud at a newcomer who attracts attention away from him.

40|$|Morals are an {{important}} part of many stories, and central to why storytelling developed in the first place as a means of communication. They have the potential to provide a framework for developing story structure, which could be utilised by modern storytelling systems. To achieve this we need a general representation for morals. We propose patterns of character emotion as a suitable foundation. In this paper, we categorise Aesop’s fables based on the morals they convey, and use them as a source of emotion data corresponding to those morals. We use inductive logic programming to identify relationships between particular patterns <b>of</b> emotion and <b>the</b> <b>morals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> in which they arise. 6 page(s...|$|R
500|$|The {{overcoming}} {{of greed}} and selfishness {{has been seen}} as the central <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> Whilst greed is a recurring theme in the novel, with many of the episodes stemming from {{one or more of the}} characters' simple desire for food (be it trolls eating dwarves or dwarves eating Wood-elf fare) or a desire for beautiful objects, such as gold and jewels, it is only by the Arkenstone's influence upon Thorin that greed, and its attendant vices [...] "coveting" [...] and [...] "malignancy", come fully to the fore in the story and provide the moral crux of the tale. Bilbo steals the Arkenstone—a most ancient relic of the dwarves—and attempts to ransom it to Thorin for peace. However, Thorin turns on the Hobbit as a traitor, disregarding all the promises and [...] "at your services" [...] he had previously bestowed. In the end Bilbo gives up the precious stone and most of his share of the treasure to help those in greater need. Tolkien also explores the motif of jewels that inspire intense greed that corrupts those who covet them in the Silmarillion, and there are connections between the words [...] "Arkenstone" [...] and [...] "Silmaril" [...] in Tolkien's invented etymologies.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, Chris was {{the focus}} of a coward punch storyline. During Kyle and Georgia's joint bucks and hen night, Chris was forced to eject a drunk Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) from The Waterhole when he caused a scene. Shortly after, Josh {{returned}} and hit Chris with a coward punch, causing him to fall and hit his head on a rock. Kyle and Georgia found Chris unconscious and he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Mason was pleased to be given the storyline, explaining that it was a topical issue in Australia at the time. He said [...] "The whole <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> is that one little mistake can have really dire consequences. I like to think that we can use this story to really educate people and get the word out there that this is something really serious that we're battling against at the moment." [...] Mason thought that Chris might be able to forgive Josh in the future, but it would be [...] "a long process", and he would {{have to deal with the}} fact that his life had changed forever due to the attack first.

Drop it like it’s hot. [...] Alas, {{in the case of}} [...] "Gimme More," [...] I’ve seen sexier pole work during an afternoon of fly-fishing". Andrei Harmsworth of Metro commented [...] "To her credit, the video is slightly less disappointing than her mimed performance of the track at the Video Music Awards last month but it is still smeared with the same smutty hallmarks". Dose said the video [...] "sucks less than you think" [...] and added [...] "Spears appears lucid, sometimes happy, and awards-worthy editing makes her appear to be standing upright competently throughout". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said the lightning effects and digital body enhancement of the video [...] "indicate a predilection toward maintaining an image that no longer reflects reality. It doesn't point to an artist who refuses to evolve, but rather one who doesn't know how—or isn't being allowed to." [...] IGN writer Sketch Longwood called it one of Spears' hottest videos, adding that she [...] "proves to be quite skilled in the art of teasingly slinking around." [...] While reviewing the alternate version of the video in July 2011, Becky Bain of Idolator stated that [...] "Spears's last few videos — particularly the joyfully silly clip for 'I Wanna Go' — more than make up for the travesty that was the pop star's video for 'Gimme More' [...] The stripper concept was a poor choice, the barely-there outfits were ill-fitting, the 'choreography' was a joke, the editing was sloppy." ...|$|E

40|$|The Master’s thesis {{gives an}} {{overview}} of a narrative analysis method, {{which is trying to}} find a common structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> by analysing <b>the</b> narratives through roles and guiding forces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goals <b>of</b> my thesis was to test a method that is rarely used in social sciences in Estonia and try to give an overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possible usage, key points and threats <b>of</b> this method. <b>The</b> other goal <b>of</b> my thesis was to study how success and failure is being portrayed through stereotypes, ideologies and <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories.</b> To find <b>the</b> answers to the research questions and hypothesis, I took a closer look at ten narratives picturing success or failure in <b>the</b> scenarios <b>of</b> TV series “Õnne 13 ”. The method used in my research does not follow <b>the</b> ideas <b>of</b> Propp and Greimas to the detail, but is adapted to fit <b>the</b> research goals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current thesis. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uniqueness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research material, which is more complex then myths or fairytales that were used in the studies by Propp and Greimas, the used method will have a bigger focus on the context and society. The changed focus is also necessary because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goal <b>of</b> this research, which needs that context to detect the values, networks, motives and <b>morals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories.</b> <b>The</b> chosen method could be criticised for the ambiguousity in detecting the roles, but this in not an obstacle which can’t be overcome in further studies. <b>The</b> key results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analysis is, that <b>the</b> chosen <b>stories</b> do not always follow the so- called fairytale narrative and this difference is especially visible in <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> picturing <b>the</b> failure. Also, <b>the</b> characters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> success <b>stories</b> are not always noble in their actions and motives, while <b>the</b> failure <b>stories</b> are not always completely negative. The moral messages from <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> often carry a social message, trying to give an advice or a warning about some actions, describe some ideology or show members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social groups whose life is usually hidden from us. <b>The</b> discussion part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis looks at the parallels between the TV series and popular narratives or characters in Estonian folk tales. This leads to a conclusion, that <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> and narratives told in every culture, bare <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> given society. We may not like what <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> tell us, but people seldom like the truth anyway...|$|R

2500|$|El Conde Lucanor (the name Lucanor {{being taken}} from the prose Tristan), also {{entitled}} the Libro de enxemplos, was first printed by Gonzalo Argote de Molina at Seville in 1575, and it revealed Don Juan Manuel as a master {{in the art of}} prose composition, and as the predecessor of Boccaccio in the province of romantic narrative. The structure of stories reflects the ordinances and hierarchical structuring of the medieval world. In the first parts a young nobleman, Lucanor, proposes an abstract problem to Patronio; later, he gives an apologue which extracts the solution from Patronio's tale, applying it to himself.

When his story was concluded, there was much laughter and approbation, particularly from two or three deputy aldermen, who had been asleep {{the greater part of}} the time. There was, however, one tall, dry-looking old gentleman, with beetling eyebrows, who maintained a grave and rather severe face throughout, now and then folding his arms, inclining his head, and looking down upon the floor, as if turning a doubt over in his mind. He was one of your wary men, who never laugh but upon good grounds--when they have reason and law on their side.

60|$|The play called The Merchant of Venice {{happens to}} be about usury, and its story is a medieval satire on usury.

It is a perfect and pointed story for its purpose, which is to convey the <b>moral</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> And the moral is that the logic of usury is in its nature at war with life, and might logically end in breaking into the bloody house of life. In other words, if a creditor can always claim a man's tools or a man's home, he might quite as justly claim one of his arms or legs. This principle was not only embodied in medieval satires but in very sound medieval laws, which set a limit on the usurer who was trying to take away a man's livelihood, as the usurer in the play is trying to take away a man's life. And if anybody thinks that usury can never go to lengths wicked enough to be worthy of so wild an image, then that person either knows nothing about it or knows too much.
