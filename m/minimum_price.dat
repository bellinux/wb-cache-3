The keys are sold by third-party providers such as Humble Bundle (in which {{a portion of}} the sale is given back to the publisher or distributor), distributed as part of a physical release to redeem the game, or given to a user as part of promotions, often used to deliver Kickstarter and other crowd funding rewards. A grey market exists around Steam keys, where less reputable buyers purchase a large number of Steam keys for a game when it is offered for a low cost, and then resell these keys to users or other third-party sites at a higher price, generating profit for themselves. This caused some of these third-party sites, like G2A, to be embroiled in this grey market. It is possible for publishers to have Valve to track down where specific keys have been used and cancel them, removing the product from the user's libraries, leaving the user to seek any recourse with the third-party they purchased from. Other legitimate storefronts, like Humble Bundle, have set a <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> that must be spent to obtain Steam keys as to discourage mass purchases that would enter the grey market.|$|E
5|$|The airline started {{negotiating}} a charter contract {{agreement with the}} Danish tour operator Spies Rejser in July 1970. Trans Polar offered the operator the use of two Boeing 720s for 55 million Danish krone (DKK), 10 million lower than the incumbent Scanair was bidding, which would allow Spies to transport 140,000 of their annual 250,000 passengers. As the first aircraft was bound to existing operations, Trans Polar would have to procure two additional aircraft for the contract, as well as receive operating permission in Denmark. Trans Polar and Spies signed a contract in mid-August for one weekly service from Copenhagen to Gran Canaria, while another weekly contract was awarded to Maersk Air. Negotiations for the main contract started on 5 September; Scanair had stated a <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> it could accept, largely {{based on the fact}} that Spies did not have an alternative operator. The successful negotiations with Trans Polar also included an agreement with Spantax, who each could offer Spies 70,000 seats for the season. The contract brought annual revenue of DKK25 million to Trans Polar. To fly the operations, two ex-Aer Lingus Boeing 720s were registered on 16 October. The company later signed agreements with the Danish tour operators Karavan-rejser and Danmarks Internasjonale Studentkomite (DIS).|$|E

That is achieved by setting a <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> for a certain product above the equilibrium price, {{the point at which}} the supply and demand curves cross, which guarantees a <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> to producers, encouraging them to produce more and thus creating a surplus ready to be used as a buffer stock.

We now {{have an understanding of}} the equilibria of these auctions, via game-theoretic concepts like Generalized English Auctions and the “locally envy-free ” property, as well as through a relationship to the well-known, truthful Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism. In practice, however, position auctions are implemented with additional constraints, in particular, bidder-specific <b>minimum</b> <b>prices.</b> Such <b>minimum</b> <b>prices</b> are used to control the quality of the ads that appear on the page. We study the effect of bidder-specific <b>minimum</b> <b>prices</b> in position auctions. Naïvely enforcing <b>minimum</b> <b>prices</b> in the VCG mechanism breaks the truthfulness of the auction; we describe two variants of VCG for which revealing the truth is a dominant strategy. The implications of bidder-specific <b>minimum</b> <b>prices</b> are more intricate for the GSP auction. Some properties proved for standard GSP no longer hold in this setting. For example, we show that the GSP allocation is now not always efficient (in terms of advertiser value). Also, the property of“envy-locality”enjoyed by GSP—which is essential in the prior analysis of strategies and equilibria— no longer holds. Our main result is to show that despite losing envy locality, GSP with bidder-specific <b>minimum</b> <b>prices</b> still has an envy-free equilibrium. 1...|$|R

25|$|Critics {{argue that}} Fairtrade harms all non-Fairtrade farmers. Fairtrade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on {{increasing}} yields and quality. Economists state that, {{if this is}} indeed so, Fairtrade farmers will increase production. As the demand for coffee is highly elastic, a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, so perhaps a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. Critics quote the example of farmers in Vietnam being paid over the world price in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s. The Fairtrade <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> means that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-Fairtrade farmers, particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists, not just free marketers.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{large number}} of fair trade and ethical {{marketing}} organizations employing different marketing strategies. Most fair trade marketers believe it is necessary to sell the products through supermarkets to get a sufficient volume of trade to affect the developing world. The Fairtrade brand is by far the biggest of the fair trade coffee brands. Packers in developed countries pay a fee to The Fairtrade Foundation for the right to use the brand and logo, and nearly all the fee goes to marketing. Packers and retailers can charge as much as they want for the coffee. The coffee has to come from a certified fair trade cooperative, and there is a <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> when the world market is oversupplied. Additionally, the cooperatives are paid an additional 10c per lb premium by buyers for community development projects. The cooperatives can, on average, sell only a third of their output as fair trade, because of lack of demand, and sell the rest at world prices. The exporting cooperative can spend the money in several ways. Some go to meeting the costs of conformity and certification: as they have to meet fair trade standards on all their produce, they have to recover the costs from a small part of their turnover, sometimes as little as 8%, and may not make any profit. Some meet other costs. Some is spent on social projects such as building schools, health clinics and baseball pitches. Sometimes there is money left over for the farmers. The cooperatives sometimes pay farmers a higher price than farmers do, sometimes less, but there is no evidence on which is more common.|$|E

[...] Bennett replied that price decreases were inevitable {{in the face of a}} global oversupply of 400 million bushels. [...] Brownlee also sought assistance from Bennett in dealing with banks' increasing reluctance to loan money to farmers, many of whom would not be able to purchase seed for the 1931 crop without loans. [...] Brownlee himself offered such farmers limited assistance, but only quietly and only in the last resort; he was concerned that a well-publicized and widespread program of loan guarantees would induce banks to loan money under predatory terms, knowing that if the farmers could not make the repayments the province would. [...] When he reluctantly agreed to guarantee banks' loans to farmers for binder twine, he insisted that these guarantees be kept secret to discourage farmers from shifting loans that they could pay off themselves to the provincial government. [...] To address the problem of farmers being forced to pledge one third of their crop as security on loans, he threatened to implement legislation capping such crop share guarantees at one quarter. [...] As he had hoped, this threat enhanced lenders' willingness to negotiate with his government for less radical solutions; these eventually included caps that applied only in low yield areas of the province and an agreement to give three to four weeks notice before initiating foreclosures and to initiate them only where farmers' payments did not even cover interest. [...] Despite these minor successes, Brownlee's strategy of negotiation and relying on the reasonableness of all parties rather than imposing strong legislation left his popularity among farmers diminished.
