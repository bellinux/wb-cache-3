The left half carcasses were jointed into eight wholesale joints, and dissected into muscles, fat and bone, which were weighed separately. Sheep had greater (p< 0. 05) slaughter BW (22. 29 kg vs 20. 50 kg) and empty BW (20. 17 kg vs 18. 67 kg) than goats (p< 0. 05).

Sheep carcasses had lower (p< 0. 001) proportion (66. 18 % vs 71. 64 %) of muscles and higher (p< 0. 001) proportion of fat (7. 41 % vs 3. 44 %) than goat carcasses.

40|$|Rib cage 3 D {{reconstruction}} is {{an important}} prerequisite for thoracic spine modelling, particularly for studies of the deformed thorax in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. This study proposes a new method for rib cage 3 D reconstruction from biplanar radiographs, using a statistical parametric model approach. Simplified parametric models were defined at the hierarchical levels of rib cage surface, rib midline and rib surface, and applied on a database of 86 trunks. The resulting parameter database served to statistical models learning which were used to quickly provide a first estimate of the reconstruction from identifications on both radiographs. This solution was then refined by manual adjustments {{in order to improve}} the matching between model and image. Accuracy was assessed by comparison with 29 rib cages from CT scans in terms of geometrical parameter differences and in terms of line-to-line error distance between the rib midlines. Intra and inter-observer reproducibility were determined regarding 20 scoliotic patients. The first estimate (mean reconstruction time of 2 ’ 30) was sufficient to extract the <b>main</b> <b>rib</b> cage global parameters with a 95 % confidence interval lower than 7 %, 8 %, 2 % and 4 ° for rib cage volume, antero-posterior and lateral maximal diameters and maximal rib hump, respectively.
