5000|$|Wiehl {{is first}} {{recorded}} in 1131 {{under the name}} of Wila. On the 1575 Mercator map it is shown as Wiell. Wiehl was eventually allocated in the 1604 Treaty of Siegburg to the Barony of Homburg and was subordinated with it to the House of Sayn-Wittgenstein. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna assigned the little Homburg territory, which practically only consisted of the municipalities of Wiehl and Nümbrecht, to Prussia. At that time, Wiehl was still an agriculturally oriented settlement with a village character. Those in the population who could not earn a living from the land had to serve as <b>migratory</b> <b>labour.</b> Not until {{the second half of the}} 19th century were the conditions created for a significant increase in population. In 1860, the water power of the River Wiehl was first utilised by the Ohler Hammer Mill; in 1895, the river was used to generate electricity; the place was connected to the railway network in 1897 and the BPW Bergische Achsen factory was founded in 1898. The Nazi era left Wiehl a new town hall (today called the [...] "Old Town Hall"). After the Second World War Wiehl integrated the influx of refugees who had been bombed out or expelled. In the municipal reorganisation in 1969, it was combined with Bielstein and Drabenderhöhe and, in 1971, 840 years after its first record, it was granted town rights. Since that time it has grown steadily, partly through the arrival of immigrants and through policies encouraging the growth of industry.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{documents}} the main {{findings of the}} vulnerable profiling work {{carried out in the}} State of Himachal Pradesh, India, as a mean to support the planning of food security and livelihoods promoting interventions at the state level. A similar study was undertaken in Orissa, India. The paper analyses the main characteristics and causes of food insecurity and vulnerability, seeking to identify who and where the vulnerable and food insecure are, why they are at risk of becoming food insecure and what options exist to reduce this risk. Using the sustainable livelihoods framework and collecting qualitative and quantitative data collection from four selected districts, the paper looks on the vulnerability of five livelihood groups, notably subsistence farming households, marginal commercial farming households, agricultural <b>labouring</b> households, <b>migratory</b> <b>labouring</b> households and pastoralist tribal households. Whilst Himachal Pradesh is comparably less food insecure, the paper shows that the state do face a range of challenges related to undernourishment and malnutrition. Anthropometric measures show that close to every second child under five in HP are underweight and 41 percent of adult women are anaemic, only slightly lower than the national figure. The study finds the main causes of food insecurity and vulnerability include increased fragmentation of land, limited or no access to welfare provisions and public services related to migration, weak infrastructure and lack of accessible credit institutions. Based on the findings of the analysis, the paper identifies key interventions to address the causes of food insecurity and vulnerability in Himachal Pradesh. These include increased investment in irrigation; improved extension services; ensuring social service provision and basic human welfare; and continued assurance of high levels of investment in constructing and maintaining rural infrastructure as a prerequisite for sustainable and broad-based economic growth. Finally, the paper includes recommendations on indicators to be monitored as part of a potential Food Insecurity and Vulnerability Information and Mapping System (FIVIMS) in Himachal Pradesh, focusing on a core set of indicators to be monitored at state and district level.

The empirical findings from fieldwork in a village in the Red River Delta of Vietnam show how dependence on agriculture is determined by family context, including land, education and job of household members, their gender and age.

In contrast to much existing research work on the patterns and control of Chinese unauthorised migration to the West, the focus here is on the regulation of immigration violators who routinely {{move back and forth}} across the border between the People's Republic of China and the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong. Through an examination of official statistics, relevant documents and pilot interviews with police officers, immigration officials and prison officers, this article aims to provide some critical insights into the operationalization of the migratory control regime in Hong Kong.

40|$|Following the Russo-Japanese War Japan {{acquired}} {{its second}} formal colony, Karafuto (southern Sakhalin), which became thoroughly integrated with mainland Japan, developing into an important supplier of marine products, lumber, paper and pulp, and coal. This sparsely populated colony offered {{the prospect of}} large scale settlement and {{over the course of}} the Japanese colonial period the population of the Karafuto increased to over 400, 000 before the Pacific War. This thesis traces the course of migration to Karafuto and assesses the role of settlement policy, and <b>migratory</b> <b>labour</b> in colonial settlement. Utilizing colonial media, government reports and local documents, as well as the recollections of former settlers, this study argues that the phenomenon of <b>migratory</b> <b>labour</b> acted as an indirect means for establishing a permanent settler community in Karafuto. This study stresses that the colonial government of Karafuto’s efforts towards the establishment of permanent settlements based on agriculture largely failed. Instead, it was industries that involved the utilization of <b>migratory</b> <b>labour</b> which acted as base-industries for economic life in the colony, and helped support Karafuto’s more enduring communities. Indeed, even in the few cases of successfully established government sponsored agricultural communities in Karafuto, seasonal <b>migratory</b> <b>labour</b> and nonagricultural activity were a persistently crucial component of the community’s economic life. A further implication of this study relates to the comprehensive integration of Karafuto with <b>migratory</b> <b>labour</b> markets in northern mainland Japan and Hokkaido. Evidence presented in this study allows us to question the prevalent notions that northern Japan was an isolated, or poorly connected, region. Instead, it is found that the prefectures of Japan’s northeast were actively engaged in northward bound settlement and <b>migratory</b> <b>labour</b> circuits...|$|E

A num-ber of explanations for the sudden violent politicisation of hostels have been advanced. The first is that the marginalisation of hostels by the surrounding communities has alienated hostel residents from both townships and shack settlements. The acute politicisation of urban life has meant that it is in the political sphere that this marginalisation has been most strongly felt. In the process hostels have developed their own identity which, because of then-existential experiences, has assumed political dimensions as well. There are problems with this explanation. Firstly, the marginalisation thesis fails to account for the recent upsurge of political activity in the hostels as a whole. Secondly, out of 11 hostels in the Greater Durban Functional Region, only two, Umlazi and Kwa Mashu, have become political trouble spots...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} has been {{conducted}} to know the general profile, educational status, activities performed and income of the <b>migratory</b> child <b>labour</b> vis-a-vis the natives engaged in agricultural activities in Punjab. The study {{is based on a}} sample of twelve villages randomly taken from three agro-climatic zones. In all the villages, 302 children working in agricultural sector were identified and all of them were the respondents of this study. It has been found that about one-fourth of the child labour working in agricultural and allied activities in the state of Punjab are migrants from other states, viz. Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. Most of the migrant child workers were in the age group of 12 - 14 years. The ratio of female child labour was higher in migrants than in natives. A very high number of child labour belonging to both migrant and native families were from scheduled caste families. All the migratory working children belonged to the landless families of labourers. The educational status of the migrant child labour portrayed a very grim picture. None of them was found going to the school and the reason behind their absenteeism was migration from other states. The child labour was belonging to the low income families. Children were engaged in various agricultural activities such as ploughing, sowing, irrigation, paddy transplantation, crop watching, cattle grazing, crop hartvesting wheatear picking stubble harvesting, pea plucking, cotton picking, potato digging, etc. Children were also employed in dairy farms and poultry farms. The wage earnings of working children were meagre. Special schools for migrants in the rural areas of the state can be opened where they may be taught through their mother tongue. Night schools or schools on the pattern of Charwaha Schools of Bihar may also be started to cater to the needs of working children. The study has also suggested that more employment avenues for adult labour, especially for the women in the villages of the state, should be generated through promoting agro-based industries and traditional handicrafts such as embroidery, pickle-papad making, etc. Child Labour, Migration, Child <b>labour</b> wages, <b>Migratory</b> child <b>labour,</b> Agricultural and Food Policy, J 61, J 62, R 23,...|$|R

40|$|The Xhosa {{people of}} the {{south-eastern}} part of South Africa {{have been involved in}} <b>migratory</b> <b>labour</b> for three generations and more. This study is concerned with the experience of migrant labour among the Gcaleka, who form part of the Xhosa cluster, and who reside in the Willowvale district of the Transkei. It is primarily an attempt to examine and understand the ways in which conservative ("red") Gcaleka society has adapted to the institution of large scale, oscillating labour migration, by looking at the "meaning" of migrant labour to the people involved, {{and in terms of the}} relationship between rural social structure and going out to work in town or mine. Much of this meaning and of the relationship between structure and migration is evident in certain ritual and symbolic actions which are associated with a labour migrant's departure from and return to the community. The bulk of the study, therefore, is taken up with a description and analysis of these "rituals of labour migration". An attempt has been made also to relate the rituals of labour migration to the structural principles of society and to underlying moral and religious beliefs and values, and also to the wider Southern African socio-political framework of which the Gcaleka are part. During fieldwork constant reference was made by informants to (ukwakh' umzi) the importance of "building the homestead" and the role of migrant labour in this. The procedure followed here, therefore, after having dealt with basic "background" material and having given an indication of the economic dependence of Gcaleka on migrant labour, is to take the individual homestead as a central reference point. Certain important aspects of social and religious life (kinship, ward section organization, economic relationships and the ancestor cult) are discussed from the point of view of the homestead and the relationships between homesteads in order to outline basic social organizational principles and to identify the socio-economic importance and cultural meaning of <b>migratory</b> <b>labour</b> to conservative Gcaleka. This leads into a discussion of Gcaleka morality in an attempt to demonstrate that the two basic organizational pr inc iples, patrilineali ty and neighbourhood, and their interrelationship, have a counterpart in moral thought. This discussion involves also some tentative ideas regarding the nature of the relationship between morality and religion in this society. All this, it is hoped, provides a basis for the description and analysis of the rituals of labour migration, which follow and which express, inter alia, the importance of the homestead, the organizational importance of kinship and neighbourhood, and certain basic moral precepts. Particular attention is paid to the most elaborate and spectacular of these rituals, the umsindleko beer drink. A separate section is devoted to an attempted analysis of the rituals in terms of Van Gennep's well known schema of rites de passage. Here the absent migrant is viewed as being one who has been separated from society and who has entered a liminal state, to be incorporated back into society once he returns from work. The extent to which liminality is accompanied by the experience of what Victor Turner calls "communitas" is also considered. The general conclusion is that the rituals of labour migration serve as a cultural device to rigidly separate the world of work from the morally superior home reality, to reinforce acceptance of the culturally determined role of <b>migratory</b> <b>labour</b> and migrant labourers and to relate the migratory experience to rural social structure in such a way that the threat of migrant labour is overcome and the rural structure strengthened. To answer the question of why this standpoint towards labour migration has been adopted, it is necessary to outline the position of the Gcaleka within the political economy of Southern Africa, and it is argued that the maintenance of conservatism and the interpretation of migrant labour in terms of the rural structure is largely a response to this positio...|$|E
40|$|A {{qualitative}} and quantitative study was undertaken to understand the support for learning provided by African parents {{in the education of}} their children. In this study we investigated the extent, level, form and content of the support of parents in the learning of their children during the Foundation Phase with special reference to a Tsonga community. Parents’ support is regarded as an essential factor in children’s learning, but more information is needed about the practices of such support for African children in the Foundation Phase. There are some parents (educated or not) who do not provide effective support. In some instances, parents do not stay with their children because of <b>migratory</b> <b>labour</b> practices and siblings have to carry the responsibility. Some of the parents leave early for work and return home late while children are asleep, which makes {{it difficult for them to}} provide optimal support.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the dairy {{industry}} {{has grown in}} land area, number of cows, milk production and dairy exports {{to the point where}} it is New Zealand’s premier exporter. Growth has been accompanied by significant structural changes to the industry. In particular, many small, family owned and managed farms, that were characterised by high levels of self employment, have been replaced by large scale ‘factory’ style, irrigated farms that depend on non family, often casualized and seasonal workers, who work very long hours. Staffing these farms has been problematic and recruitment and retention have been regularly highlighted issues. Such issues have cast doubt on the social sustainability of the dairy industry. The future of the dairy industry to a large degree depends on its people. Many of these people are now migrants, who have become ‘essential’ because traditional sources of labour are inadequate. Does a dependence on migrant workers jeopardise the future stability and sustainability of dairy production? Can all stakeholders in the industry benefit from migratory staff in such a way that all parties achieve a winning outcome, as for the horticultural Recognised Seasonal Employer Scheme. A profound change in the dairy industry may be necessary to ensure that stakeholders make the effort necessary to negotiate such a multi win outcome, which might provide a lasting rather than a temporary solution.

Shipping lists, which meticulously recorded the biographical details of each labourer, together with Indian immigrant reports, provide a wealth of information on the early <b>migratory</b> and <b>labour</b> experiences of indentured Indians. Regrettably, similar documentation regarding passenger or free Indian migration to Natal is absent in the South African archival records. This article adopts a biographical approach as a methodological tool to map the identification practices involved in the migration of passenger or free Indian immigrants to Natal between 1880 and 1930. Both the colonial and Union governments sought to regulate the entry of these immigrants through a system of identity documents. Passage tickets, domicile certificates, affidavits, Certificates of Identity and passports not only facilitated and hindered both individual and family migration, but also show how citizenship was defined, and migration controls were instituted and administered to free immigrants. Thus, as British subjects, free Indian immigrants were not really free but had to constantly, defend and reclaim their civic rights, and attest and verify their identity as the colonial and later the Union government sought new and creative ways to restrict and prohibit their entry. This article illustrates the usefulness of a biographical approach to migration studies, in not only highlighting individual but collective immigrant experiences, which provide a way of capturing the diversity, complexity and the transformational nature of free Indian migration to Natal...|$|R

It comprises a baseline survey among 38 railway gardeners across MMR characterized by different demographic, socio-economic, <b>migratory,</b> and <b>labour</b> characteristics.

All the railway gardeners practiced agriculture as a primary source of income and cultivated seasonal vegetables such as lady’s finger (Abelmoschus esculentus L.

This irrigation water was loaded with 7 – 28 mg N l^(− 1), 0. 3 – 7 mg P l^(− 1), and 8 – 32 mg K l^(− 1), but also contained heavy metals such as lead (0. 02 – 0. 06 mg Pb l^(− 1)), cadmium (0. 03 – 0. 17 mg Cd l^(− 1)), mercury (0. 001 – 0. 005 mg Hg l^(− 1)), and pathogens such as Escherichia coli (1, 100 most probable number per 100 ml). Levels of heavy metals exceeded the critical thresholds in surface soils (Cr, Ni, and Sr) and produce (Pb, Cd, and Sr).

40|$|Ghana has {{achieved}} dramatic improvements in national food security in recent years, but concealed in this overall progress {{is a considerable}} measure of regional unevenness, with the population living in the dry savannah regions in the north faring the worst. The Upper West Region (UWR) is the poorest region of Ghana and has long served as a reservoir of <b>migratory</b> <b>labour</b> for the southern parts of the country, {{but in recent years}} migration patterns have been both escalating and changing. Increasingly, permanent UWR migration is focusing on the more fertile lands of the Brong-Ahafo Region (BAR), where migrants are able to access farmland in different leasehold relationships. A rapid research appraisal conducted in Techiman (BAR) suggests that UWR migrants view their growing settlement in the BAR to be a long-term phenomenon. It also highlighted how land tenancy issues are central to the challenges migrant farmers face, and are largely perceived as being immutable by the farmers themselves. Nearly all new UWR migrants must begin working in sharecropping relationships for BA landlords, paying out one-third of their harvest as rent, and over time they hope to save sufficient market earnings in order to lease the land outright. Despite these rents and the high cost of transportation, this chapter suggests that evolving migration patterns from the Upper West Region (UWR) of Ghana are connected to an intensifying system of domestic “food aid” (i. e. non-market transfers) back to the region, providing a crucial means of coping with its precarious food insecurity. With environmental conditions in dry regions of Sahelian Africa projected to worsen with climate change, the agricultural capacity of the UWR is likely to deteriorate further in coming years, with migratory pressures therefore continuing to rise. In light of this, this study points towards both future research objectives in the UWR and the BAR, {{as well as to the}} implications such research could have for policy interventions and locally grounded regional initiatives...|$|E

Met ander woorde, die opvoeder as leermediator word bemagtig deur die Norme en Standaarde om sekere kompetensies te bereik. Onder Norme en Standaarde kyk hierdie studie na die verskillende ratio‟s wat op onderwys betrekking het. Hierdie ratio‟s vorm „n sameloop wat Inklusiewe Onderrig tot so „n mate strem, dat die gewenste kompetensies nie bereik kan word nie. Hoewel Inklusiewe Onderrig nie die enigste faktor is wat Norme en Standaarde bepaal nie, is dit wel „n belangrike een, en hierdie studie fokus dus daarop. Saam met Norme en Standaarde is daar ook sosio-ekonomiese faktore wat Inklusiewe Onderrig strem, en dit word ondersoek. In die lig van die {{probleme}} ten opsigte van die leerder:opvoeder-ratio, die leerder:m²-ratio, die woonpersele:skoolperseel-ratio, norme- en standaarde-toekenning, ongelykhede (ekonomiese, ouderdoms- en emosionele en fisiese ontwikkeling), enkelouerskap en fetale alkoholsindroom (FAS), word daar in die verhandeling gekyk na die haalbaarheid van die realisering van die drie kompetensies naamlik die praktiese, fondasionele en refleksiewe kompetensies. Die studie bevind dat die bereiking van kompetensies haalbaar is, mits daar aan die ratio‟s en die sosio-ekonomiese omstandighede gewerk word. Na aanleiding van my navorsing kan die meeste opvoeders verslag doen van hul werksaamhede, maar dit is egter nie die positiewe, progressiewe verslag wat van ‟n leermediator verwag word nie. Norme en standaarde is na my mening nog haalbaar omdat daar bewys is dat leerders, ondanks die negatiewe effek van die ratio‟s, asook die ontoereikende voorsiening (geld, menslike hulpbronne en voorrade) en die ekonomiese en ouderdomsverskille en FAS, tog die potensiaal toon om te leer. Die probleem is egter dat te veel leerders onderpresteer, uit die onderwys- en opvoedingstelsel verdwyn en nie deel raak van die ekonomiese hoofstroom nie. Deur dus aandag te gee aan die stremminge wat ek nagevors het, kan verseker word dat Inklusiewe Onderwys tot sy reg kom, kompetensies bereik word en die opvoeder ‟n suksesvolle leermediasie fasiliteer. SLEUTELWOORDE: Opvoeder, leermediator, Norme en Standaarde, Inklusiewe Onderwys, konseptueleENGLISH ABSTRACT: The Norms and Standards for Educators policy {{states that}} certain competencies must be achieved. To this end the policy empowers the educator as learning mediator. With {{reference to the}} Norms and Standards, this study explores the different ratios applicable to education. These ratios form a combination which hamper Inclusive Education {{to the extent that}} the competencies cannot be achieved. Although Inclusive Education is not the only aspect which affects Norms and Standards, it is a very important one, and this study thus explores Inclusive Education. Together with Norms and Standards, there are also socio-economic factors that hamper Inclusive Education, which this study also explores. In the light of the problems with the learner:educator ratio, the learner:m² ratio, the residential erven:school erf ratio, the allocation of norms and standards, unequal economic circumstances, unequal development phases (emotional, physical and age), single parenthood and fetal alcohol syndrome, this thesis explores the feasibility of the realisation of the three competencies namely the practical, foundational and reflexive competencies. This study finds that, providing that attention is paid to the ratios and socio-economic factors, the achievement of competencies are feasible. My research shows that, while most of the educators can report on their activities, it is not the positive and progressive report which one expects from a learning mediator. Norms and Standards, in my view, is feasible since there is evidence to suggest that learners, despite the negative effect of the ratios and inadequate resources (finances, human resources and supplies), economic and age differences, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), still displays the potential to learn. The problem, however, is that too many learners underperform, and then leave the school and education system. They then fail to become part of the main economic system. I conclude that, by giving attention to the hindrances I researched, it can be ensured that Inclusive Education reaches its full potential, that competencies are achieved, and that educators facilitate a successful learning mediation process. vi KEY WORDS: Educator, learning mediator, Norms and Standards, Inclusive Education, conceptual analysis, ratios, urbanisation, norms- and standards allocation, <b>migratory</b> <b>labour,</b> single parentwood, <b>migratory</b> <b>labour,</b> urbanisation, and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome...|$|E
40|$|M. Comm. Everywhere in {{the world}} today, we read about {{enterprises}} undergoing rapid change. Business organisations are being challenged by aspects of both the external and internal environments. The external considerations include markets, competitors, macroeconomic factors, industry factors and other related factors. The internal pressures are demands for more flexible, family-friendly employment practices, demands for consultation and information, as well as concern for training and quality standards [Thomas 1994 : 202]. In South Africa, the political change that was {{brought about by the}} 1994 elections necessitated the repositioning of organisations. The repositioning of businesses and other organisations should be seen as part of the reconstruction of the economy which is currently trapped in a deep-seated structural crisis (RDP, 1994 : 75). The economic and political framework within which the economy was structured encouraged regional disparities ensuring <b>migratory</b> <b>labour</b> supply from the former homelands to cities and towns. Enforced segregation and industrial decentralisation were instruments that ensured that the black population remained honed in the "homelands" where per capita incomes were {{less than a quarter of}} the national average (RDP, 1994). The above impacted negatively upon the development of blacks as managers, in that they were in terms of apartheid ethos not supposed to hold managerial position in urban areas, unless if they qualified in terms of the Group Areas Act [Black Urban Areas Act No. 25 of 1945]. The above position was aggravated by the deliberate neglect to train blacks which ensured that they remained disempowered and inferior to their white counterparts. The Group Areas Act on the other hand ensured that black's entry into urban areas was regulated notwithstanding the fact that jobs were scarce in the 'homelands'. Though South Africa has entered into the new era in political terms, the South African business structures have not changed and that disparities that existed in the past are still a features of the present. Though foreign markets are now opened and new opportunities offered to South Africans, the economy is still characterised by lack of skilled manpower and in particular its leadership is not representative of the composition of the South African society...|$|E
40|$|After the Enlargement of the European Union in 2004, {{around a}} million Accession State {{migrants}} {{arrived in the}} United Kingdom, with Polish migrants constituting the largest group. There is {{a growing body of}} literature focusing on their <b>migratory</b> patterns, networks, <b>labour</b> market performance, and identity. However, little has been said so far about the Polish migrants' relationship with law in the United Kingdom. This thesis asks: how do the Polish post- 2004 EU Enlargement migrants form their relationship with the law, and what are the factors that affect this? It focuses on the intricacies of migrants' choices of `semi-legal' over legal status, subsequent legalization strategies, and the interpretations of legality they result in. Socio-legal integration has so far been viewed solely via state legal frameworks, following the traditional approach of the `law-first' perspective. This thesis argues {{that it is not the}} institutional arrangements and legal architecture alone that decide the nature of migrants' semi-legal relationship with law in the host society. A more comprehensive insight into the socio-legal integration of migrants is possible only when we combine in the analysis the interplay between the structural factors of the host country's legal environment, migrants' agency and the culturally derived values, attitudes, behaviour and social expectations towards the law and its enforcement. The thesis therefore makes a case for a `proper' recognition of migrants' legal culture in the study of their socio-legal integration. The thesis concludes that semi-legality, as an initial response to the legal environment is not static, but changing. As a result, migrants' socio-legal integration is extended in time and gradual. Migrants' legality could be discussed at two levels - at the behavioural level and at the level of a value. Changing status between the two poles of legality and illegality brings with it greater appreciation of legality as a value. This research presents a strong argument that the relationship between behaviour and attitudes to law could be meaningfully investigated in an applied domain of the new socio-legal environment.

The dramatic increase of migratory flows {{is caused by a}} complex conjunction of push and pull factors: the demise of the Soviet empire and of communist multinational states, and an escalation of third-world misery and tribal warfare, are among the major push factors; on the pull side, the world has become a smaller and traversable place, as electronic images and cultural icons of first-world riches reach far into the non-Western hinterlands, transnational corporations set up dependencies in Asia and Africa, and airline tickets are casier to get, thus lowering the barriers for trying one's luck in the headquarters of a globalized world. A characteristic of such push-pull migrations is the breakdown of neat categorization: economic migrations, which have become synonymous with "immigration", can no longer be easily distinguished from ethnic homeland migrations, in which whole categories of people are forced to move because of violent regime changes, war, or conquest.

40|$|The {{emergence}} {{of the idea of}} multiculturalism in Swedish public discourse and social science {{in the latter half of}} the 1960 s and introduction of official multiculturalism in 1975 constituted a major intellectual and political shift in the post-war history of Sweden. The ambition of the 1975 immigrant and minority policy to enable the preservation of ethno-cultural minorities and to create a positive attitude towards the new multicultural society among the majority population was also incorporated into Swedish cultural, educational and media policies. The rejection of assimilationism and the new commitment to ethno-cultural diversity, the multicultural moment, has earned Sweden a place on the list of the early adopters of official multiculturalism, together with Canada and Australia. This compilation thesis examines the origins and early post-war history of the idea of multiculturalism as well as the interplay between idea and politics in the shift from a public ideal of homogeneity to an ideal of multiculturalism in Sweden. It does so from a range of conceptual, comparative, transnational, and biographical perspectives. The thesis consists of an introduction (Part I) and four previously published studies (Part II). The primary research result of the thesis concerns the agency involved in the break-through and formal establishment of the idea of multiculturalism in Sweden. Actors such as ethnic activists, experts and officials were instrumental in the introduction and establishment of multiculturalism in Sweden, as they also had been in Canada and in Australia. These actors have, however, not previously been recognized and analysed as significant idea-makers and political agents in the case of Sweden. The intertwined connections between activists, social scientists, linguists, and officials facilitated the transfer of the idea of multiculturalism from a publically contested idea to public policy via the way of The Swedish Trade Union Confederation, academia and the Royal Commission of Immigration. The thesis furthermore shows that the political success of the idea of multiculturalism, such as it was within the limits of the universalist social democratic welfare state, was dependent on whom the claims-makers were, the status and positions they held, and the way the idea of multiculturalism was conceptualised and used. It was also dependent on the <b>migratory</b> context of <b>labour</b> immigration in the 1960 s and 1970 s and on whose behalf the advocates of multiculturalism made their claims. The majority of the labour immigrants were Finnish citizens from the former eastern half of the kingdom of Sweden who were net contributors to the Swedish welfare state. This facilitated the recognition of their ethno-cultural difference, and, following the logic of universalism, the ethno-cultural difference of other minority groups in Sweden. The historical significance of the multicultural moment is still evident in the contemporary immigration and integration policies of Sweden. The affirmation of diversity continues to set Sweden apart from the rest of Europe, now more so than in the 1970 s, even though the migratory context has changed radically in the last 40 years...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an ethnographic study of {{collaborative}} action and notions {{of value in}} San Isidro, an indigenous community of c. 90 families in Ecuador’s central highlands. Drawing on Arendt’s theory of action {{as a mode of}} human togetherness, it focuses on forms of activity that are both affective (appealing to particular values, principles and practices) and productive (engaging in struggles to reorder social and economic relations). These include communal gatherings, shared work-parties, assemblies, meetings, campaigns and celebrations. Developing work by Lambek and Graeber, the thesis explores how such actions are used to generate different kinds of ethical and material value, the criteria people use to evaluate competing visions of hope and possibility, and the related dynamics of division and cooperation. I argue that such a focus on action and value allows us to build on insights from existing regional literature which tends to interpret indigenous collective action as either predominantly expressive (through cultural revival) or instrumental (in terms of economic and political practice). A core theme that emerges is how localised expressions of what people hold to be vital or desirable interact with coordinated efforts to defend and secure livelihoods. In San Isidro, such efforts contend with a limited land base, ongoing conflicts rooted in histories of dispossession, and widespread patterns of <b>migratory</b> <b>labour</b> (mainly for shift-work in the Amazon-based oil industry). At the same time, many residents participate in collective work to maintain shared infrastructure, protest against land inequalities, and manage areas of the communally-held páramo hills (registering as a ‘comunidad’ as recently as 2009). Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted over fifteen months, I analyse how such collaborative actions are combined with everyday forms of paid and unpaid work, memories of conflict, and a sense of duty toward future generations. Through chapters that focus on shared labour, coordinated campaigns, the legacies of land reform and accounts of labour migration, the thesis also examines how cooperation is fostered within a community that is increasingly diverse in access to resources, income and outlook, and how those involved negotiate the ruptures and tensions that intentional actions entail...|$|E
40|$|In Saskatchewan, {{there is}} a dearth of {{scholarly}} documentation on the experiences of Latino migrant temporary farmworkers, especially {{with respect to their}} agricultural occupational health and safety (OHS) education and training. Other research suggests that, in Canada and the USA, systematic agricultural OHS training for Latino migrant temporary farmworkers is generally insufficient and, in many cases, linguistically and culturally inappropriate. The overall purposes of this dissertation are to investigate the major challenges with respect to Latino migrant farmworker OHS education and training, to explore the implications of these challenges, and to understand the relevant social contexts (interpersonal-organizational, community, and institutional-public policy) that add specificity and complexity to the aforementioned challenges. A blended theoretical framework incorporates the social dimensions of sustainable development in agriculture, adult education theory, innovative approaches to worker agricultural OHS education and training, critical ethnography, as well as a socioecological model of health. Critical ethnography influenced the field methodology and the interpretation of field data. As both theory and methodology, critical ethnography includes sensitivities to the challenges of intercultural communication. A thematic analysis was used to condense field interview data and to identify major themes and sub-themes. Three main themes were examined: 1) Language barriers as factors in workplace communications and workplace tensions, 2) Attitudes towards OHS learning and practices, and 3) Work organization and workplace culture as factors complicating access to English language learning. The study finds that language barriers, personal and workplace cultural factors, as well as certain aspects of <b>migratory</b> <b>labour</b> regimes and seasonal agricultural work are the major challenges to Latino farmworker OHS education, training, and learning. I conclude that Latino migrant temporary farmworkers need to receive English language training and more OHS education and training to address unsafe habits, particularly with respect to working with agricultural equipment. Language barriers and cultural factors have the potential to put both migrant and local personnel OHS at risk. Employment contracts under agricultural temporary foreign worker programs contribute to a culture of work that is focused primarily on productivity. They also contribute to preventing most Latino farmworkers from engaging in educational initiatives and from looking after their general and occupational health. Employment arrangements and conditions are also important factors that result in migrant farmworkers struggling with issues of powerlessness, family separation, isolation, and stress—circumstances that are not favourable to studying and learning nor to cultivating new health and safety habits. Effective educational communication for farmworker OHS preparation is important to ensuring the physical, mental, and social wellbeing of Latino temporary migrant farmworkers. The promotion of such wellbeing contributes to moving agriculture towards social sustainability. It is recommended that, at each workplace where Latino migrant temporary farmworkers are employed, a fully bilingual professional also be employed to act as a liaison among stakeholders and assist them with interpretation and translation. Additionally, to ensure the wellbeing of both migrant and local personnel, program stakeholders need to implement alternatives to hourly-based contracts. An important conceptual and concrete contribution of the study is that it provides an alternative adult education approach to conventional agricultural occupational health and safety promotion. In doing so, it also questions occupational health and safety frameworks that focus too exclusively on medical and engineering/technical dimensions...|$|E
40|$|The National School Nutrition Programme (NSNP) is a poverty {{alleviation}} strategy, {{which was}} introduced in 1994 by the Government of South Africa {{as part of the}} Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP). Studies of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and the World Health Organisation (WHO), show that hunger, nutrition, and poverty, are strongly correlated. The same studies note that in the world as a whole, hunger impacts negatively on Millennium Development Goals, namely universal primary education, gender equality, child mortality, maternal health, management of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), Tuberculosis (TB) and malaria, and environmental stability. Hunger, specifically, has been shown to contribute to reduced school attendance, impaired cognitive capacity, high child mortality rates, high maternal death rates, increased <b>migratory</b> <b>labour</b> that increases the spread of HIV, and the unsustainable use of forest lands and resources (South African Department of Education, 2004 : 3). ” The National School Nutrition Programme aims at providing meals to mostly the needy learners, who come from poor families. Good food provides energy for the brain. The meals that are provided at schools are, therefore, intended to give energy for mental and physical activities for the body and brain to function, and to make learners alert and receptive during lessons (South African Province of the Eastern Cape Department of Education, 2008 : 2). Currently, meals in South African Schools are provided to all learners in Quintile 1, 2 and 3 public primary schools from Grades R to 7. The programme was extended to Quintile 1 secondary schools in April 2009. All Quintile 2 and 3 public secondary schools will be included in 2010 and 2011 respectively (South African Eastern Cape Province Department of Education, 2008 : 3). To collect information for research purposes, the researcher used a qualitative approach. This approach, which is used by the researcher, seeks to identify the impediments that pose challenges to effective and efficient implementation of the NSNP in the King William’s Town District of the Department of Education in Province of the Eastern Cape. The sample covers two rural schools participating in the NSNP in the King William’s Town District, namely Fort Murray Junior and Senior Primary School, and Qongqotha Junior and Senior Primary School. In each school, the principal, the chairperson of the School Governing Body, the teacher in charge of the NSNP, and Grade 7 learners, formed part of the sample of the study. Added to these participants have been the Service Provider and the District Coordinator of the NSNP in the King William’s Town District. The researcher chose these two schools that are locally based (within a 10 km radius from the researcher’s place of residence) for convenience purposes, in terms of cutting down on travelling costs. The empirical findings were analysed and interpreted, and in presenting the findings, special reference to the research question is made, namely: “What are the challenges that impede the successful implementation of the National School Nutrition Programme in the King William’s Town District of the Eastern Cape Department of Education?” The recommendations reflected heavily on the purpose of the study, namely, that the Department of Education in the Eastern Cape has not managed the NSNP efficiently and effectively. The findings of this study reflect that there are still challenges that continue to plague the NSNP after seven years of the inception of the programme by Department of Education. The empirical findings of this study have revealed that the challenges confronting the implementation of the NSNP could be attributed to poor governance by the Department of Education officials. Some pockets of excellence of the NSNP are noted in the study. Recommendations are made to mitigate the problem situation...|$|E
