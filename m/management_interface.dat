25|$|SQL Server Management Studio is a GUI tool {{included}} with SQL Server 2005 and later for configuring, managing, and administering all components within Microsoft SQL Server. The tool includes both script editors and graphical tools {{that work with}} objects and features of the server. SQL Server Management Studio replaces Enterprise Manager as the primary <b>management</b> <b>interface</b> for Microsoft SQL Server since SQL Server 2005. A version of SQL Server Management Studio is also available for SQL Server Express Edition, {{for which it is}} known as SQL Server Management Studio Express (SSMSE).|$|E
25|$|PowerShell {{provides}} {{full access}} to COM and WMI, enabling administrators to perform administrative tasks on both local and remote Windows systems as well as WS-Management and CIM enabling management of remote Linux systems and network devices. PowerShell also provides a hosting API with which the PowerShell runtime can be embedded inside other applications. These applications can then use PowerShell functionality to implement certain operations, including those exposed via the graphical interface. This capability {{has been used by}} Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 to expose its management functionality as PowerShell cmdlets and providers and implement the graphical management tools as PowerShell hosts which invoke the necessary cmdlets. Other Microsoft applications including Microsoft SQL Server 2008 also expose their <b>management</b> <b>interface</b> via PowerShell cmdlets.|$|E

Media management and playback was enhanced with Picture and Video package, which converged the management of videos and pictures and Windows Media Player 10 Mobile. Among new hardware features were enhanced Bluetooth support, default QWERTY keyboard-support and a <b>management</b> <b>interface</b> for [...] Global Positioning System (GPS). Improvements were made to [...] ActiveSync 4.2 with 15% increased synchronization speed. Business customers benefited from a new error reporting facility similar to that present in desktop and server Windows systems. Caller ID now supports photos so a user can apply an image to each contact to show when a call is received. DirectShow was also natively added. This release was the first to include DirectDraw with hardware acceleration, replacing the deprecated graphics component of GAPI.|$|E

2500|$|Creative Labs, the American {{subsidiary}} of Creative Technology Limited, {{was awarded a}} patent on a music <b>management</b> <b>interface</b> (now commonly seen on audio players, including the Apple iPod) by the US Patent and Trademark Office on 25 August 2005, having applied for it on 5 January 2001. Apple had filed for a similar patent on 22 October 2002 but that application was rejected. At {{the launch of the}} Vision:M, Creative announced that it would [...] "aggressively pursue" [...] respect of its patents, addressing [...] "all manufacturers that use the same navigation system." [...] So far, Creative has only addressed Apple's infringement of its patent. Creative announced on 15 May 2006, that it had launched a lawsuit against Apple for the infringement of the ZEN patent (Creative also asked the US Trade Commission to investigate whether Apple was breaching trade laws by importing iPods into the US), which was then counter-sued by Apple on the same day, filing two lawsuits for infringing their patents. Subsequently, Apple and Creative reached a settlement, with Apple paying $100 million to Creative, and Creative joining the [...] "Made for iPod" [...] accessory program.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMiddleware {{has become}} the popular runtime {{infrastructure}} of modern IT systems. Due to the complex application contexts and various user requirements, more and more applications are now making use of different middleware platforms. It might require the cooperation of several types of middleware, and result in challenging issues for collaborative management of heterogeneous middleware. To solve this problem, {{it may be a}} feasible solution to make <b>management</b> <b>interfaces</b> delivered in the form of services and used in service oriented styles. In this paper, we propose an approach to encapsulating middleware <b>management</b> <b>interfaces</b> into Web services. First of all, we introduce middleware management problems induced by the development of requirements. Then, we present the technical challenges and illustrate the details about how to enable different <b>management</b> <b>interfaces</b> to be in service-oriented styles. Followed by identified technical challenges, we evaluate the approach and primarily discuss how to manage middleware systems collaboratively based on management services...|$|R
