50|$|An {{attacker}} {{already has}} access to the entire ciphertext packet. Upon retrieving the entire plaintext of the same packet, the attacker {{has access to}} the keystream of the packet, as well as the <b>MIC</b> <b>code</b> of the session. Using this information the attacker can construct a new packet and transmit it on the network. To circumvent the WPA implemented replay protection, the attacks use QoS channels to transmit these newly constructed packets. An attacker able to transmit these packets may be able to implement any number of attacks, including ARP poisoning attacks, denial of service, and other similar attacks, with no need of being associated with the network.|$|E
50|$|The {{basis of}} the attack is an {{extension}} of the WEP chop-chop attack. Because WEP uses a cryptographically insecure checksum mechanism (CRC32), an attacker can guess individual bytes of a packet, and the wireless access point will confirm or deny whether or not the guess is correct. If the guess is correct, the attacker will be able to detect the guess is correct and continue to guess other bytes of the packet. However, unlike the chop-chop attack against a WEP network, the attacker must wait for at least 60 seconds after an incorrect guess (a successful circumvention of the CRC32 mechanism) before continuing the attack. This is because although TKIP continues to use the CRC32 checksum mechanism, it implements an additional <b>MIC</b> <b>code</b> named Michael. If two incorrect Michael MIC codes are received within 60 seconds, the access point will implement countermeasures, meaning it will rekey the TKIP session key, thus changing future keystreams. Accordingly, attacks on TKIP will wait an appropriate amount of time to avoid these countermeasures. Because ARP packets are easily identified by their size, {{and the vast majority of}} the contents of this packet would be known to an attacker, the number of bytes an attacker must guess using the above method is rather small (approximately 14 bytes). Beck and Tews estimate recovery of 12 bytes is possible in about 12 minutes on a typical network, which would allow an attacker to transmit 3-7 packets of at most 28 bytes. Vanhoef and Piessens improved this technique by relying on fragmentation, allowing an attacker to transmit arbitrary many packets, each at most 112 bytes in size. The Vanhoef-Piessens attacks also can be used to decrypt arbitrary packets of the attack's choice.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} sparse linear system solver {{that is based}} on a multifrontal variant of Gaussian {{elimination}} and exploits low-rank approximation of the resulting dense frontal matrices. We use hierarchically semiseparable (HSS) matrices, which have low-rank off-diagonal blocks, to approximate the frontal matrices. For HSS matrix construction, a randomized sampling algorithm is used together with interpolative decompositions. The combination of the randomized compression with a fast ULV HSS factorization leads to a solver with lower computational complexity than the standard multifrontal method for many applications, resulting in speedups up to sevenfold for problems in our test suite. The implementation targets many-core systems by using task parallelism with dynamic runtime scheduling. Numerical experiments show performance improvements over state-of-the-art sparse direct solvers.

In seismic performance assessment of these typical non - conforming buildings, collapse safety might be significantly affected by non - linear behavior of joints th at {{are involved in}} the failure mechanism, especially if they are characterized by poor structural detailing, such as the lack of an adequate transverse reinforcement i n the joint panel. Few reliable approaches for modeling all sources of nonlinearity are p roposed in literature for poorly designed beam - column joints because of relatively poor information from experimental tests. Even if a quite significant amount of research on seismic performance of unreinforced joints has been carried out in last years, a very few portion of them handled with specimens with plain hook - ended longitudinal bars. A small number of experimental results include also the analysis of local aspects, such as the evaluation of joint shear strain. Therefore, a higher number of tests is necessary to deeper understand joint seismic response in order to validate the existing models or calibrate new ones. The current study aims at improving the understanding of seismic performance of exterior joints without transverse reinforcement in non - c onforming RC buildings through experimental tests. Four full - scale exterior unreinforced beam - column joint sub - assemblages are tested under cyclic loading. The specimens are different for beam longitudinal reinforcement ratio and for typology of longitudin al bars (plain or deformed). Two different kinds of joint failure are expected, with or without the yielding of the adjacent beam. Strain gauges located on beam bars and displacement transducers on the joint panel allow the complete definition of both the main deformability contributions, namely fixed - end - rotation and shear strain of joint panel, highlighting the difference between the observed failure modes. Design criteria, adopted setup and experimental results are described and discussed. From the analy sis of the global experimental responses, i t is observed that the higher the beam longitudinal reinforcement ratio, the higher the joint shear strength, and that t he post - peak degrading behavior is always controlled by the response of the joint panel. The analysis of local responses highlighted that the sum of the main deformability contributions due to joints (joint panel shear strain and rotation at beam/joint interface) represents the major part of the imposed drift for all tests. In particular, in tests for which the beam reaches the yielding moment, the contribution of the deformation mechanism associated to the rotation at beam - joint interface is predominant, particularly in the case of plain longitudinal reinforcement...|$|R

We apply our framework to develop multimode image <b>coding</b> (<b>MIC)</b> schemes for noisy channels, based on the adaptive DCT. The robustness of the proposed MIC is further enhanced by the incorporation of a channel protection scheme suitable for the constraints on complexity and delay.

50|$|The term message {{integrity}} <b>code</b> (<b>MIC)</b> is frequently substituted for the term MAC, especially in communications, where the acronym MAC traditionally stands for Media Access Control address. However, some authors use MIC {{to refer to}} a message digest, which is different from a MAC -- a message digest does not use secret keys. This lack of security means that any message digest intended for use gauging {{message integrity}} should be encrypted or otherwise be protected against tampering. Message digest algorithms are created such that a given message will always produce the same message digest assuming the same algorithm is used to generate both. Conversely, MAC algorithms are designed to produce matching MACs only if the same message, secret key and initialization vector are input to the same algorithm. Message digests do not use secret keys and, when taken on their own, are therefore a much less reliable gauge of message integrity than MACs. Because MACs use secret keys, they do not necessarily need to be encrypted to provide the same level of assurance.|$|R

First, the Frame Control occupies 4 bytes and uses to distinguish between control frame and data frame along with an acknowledgment. The second and third headers are the addresses of the receiver and sender sensors, respectively. Each sensor uses 1 byte to store the address.

The overall {{aim of the}} thesis is to study associative access in a Persistent Object Store (POS) providing necessary object storage and retrieval capabilities to an Object Oriented Database System (OODBS) (Delis, Kanitkar & Kollios, 1998 cited in Kirchberg & Tretiakov, 2002). Associative access in an OODBS often includes navigational access to referenced or referencing objects of the object being accessed (Kim. Kim. & Dale. 1989). The thesis reviews several existing approaches proposed to support associative and navigational access in an OODBS. It {{was found that the}} existing approaches proposed for associative access could not perform well when queries involve multiple paths or inheritance hierarchies. The thesis studies how associative access can be supported in a POS regardless of paths or inheritance hierarchies involved with a query. The thesis proposes extensions to a model of a POS such that approaches that are proposed for navigational access can be used to support associative access in the extended POS. The extensions include (1) approaches to cluster storage objects in a POS on their storage classes or values of attributes, and (2) approaches to distinguish references between storage objects in a POS based on criteria such as reference types - inheritance and association, storage classes of referenced storage objects or referencing storage objects, and reference names. The thesis implements Matrix-Index <b>Coding</b> (<b>MIC)</b> approach with the extended POS by several coding techniques. The implementation demonstrates that (1) a model of a POS extended by proposed extensions is capable of supporting associative access in an OODBS and (2) the MIC implemented with the extended POS can support a query that requires associative access in an OODBS and involves multiple paths or inheritance hierarchies. The implementation also provides proof of the concepts suggested by Kirchberg & Tretiakov (2002) that (1) the MIC can be made independent from a coding technique, and (2) data compression techniques should be considered as appropriate alternatives to implement the MIC because they could reduce the storage size required...|$|R

Therefore, the determination of color laser printers source seized in forgery crimes {{became one of the}} most challenges in digital forensic labs today. In the last decade, digital forensic labs have introduced excess approaches to try catching a source of a defendant color laser printer such as, halftone analysis (Kim & Lee, 2014), statistical analysis of discrete wavelet transform (J. Choi et al., 2009) and noisy features analysis (J. H. Choi, Lee, & Lee, 2013), etc. have used. Notwithstanding, the previous methods could give good evidence but didn’t reach to hundred percent in their detections. So, we have explored a new methodology for identifying the color laser printer source in a good attend enabling us to achieve an accuracy ratio hundred percent in our investigations. In our work, we have followed an active strategy for the identification. The active strategy has presented as a form of steganography for securing color laser printouts (Mace, 2010). The printer steganography consisted of embedded small microdots in their sizes, appeared in yellow color for a naked eye by zooming in with 36 X and called tracking dots (van Beusekom, Schreyer, & Breuel, 2010). These tracking dots called Machine identification <b>code</b> (<b>MIC)</b> (van Beusekom, Shafait, & Breuel, 2013), counterfeiting protection system code (CPS) (van Beusekom et al., 2010), and Coded dots matrix (CDM) pattern. In our route of work, we have explored color laser printers of Xerox® brand via Adobe® Photoshop® CC 2018 as a nondestructive and indirect tool to implement the steganalysis process. We have tracked these yellow dots or machine identification code because they have contained the covert information about the source of a color laser machine candidate (or a defendant). The covert information mainly has contained a serial number of a color laser machine. According to the size of a color laser printer of Xerox® brand, we could notice that not all small office color laser printers have contained the information about a date or time for the printing process. In contrary, all studied color laser multifunction printers of Xerox® brand contained a date and time for the printing process (as given in Table 1). Characteristic regions that have exhibited, a serial number, a date and time (if found) in color laser printouts of Xerox® brand has been tracking to achieve our goal for the identification step.|$|R
40|$|The {{starting}} point for this project was the iterative solution of sparse and block structured linear systems that arise from the analysis of turbulent fl ows in Computational Fluid Dynamics applications. In {{the last two years}} we have studied preconditioning techniques based on block multilevel incomplete LU factorization preconditioners for this problem class, and we have found them to be quite effective in reducing the number of GMRES iterations. These preconditioners exhibit better parallelism than standard ILU algorithms due to the recursive factorization and they may be noticeably more robust for comparable memory usage especially for solving large problems. Additionally, exploiting the available block structure in the matrix can maximize computational effi ciency. Sparse matrices arising from the solution of systems of partial differential equations often exhibit a perfect block structure, meaning that the nonzero blocks in the sparsity pattern are fully dense (and typically small), e. g., when several unknown quantities are associated with the same grid point. However, similar block orderings can be sometimes unravelled also on general unstructured matrices, by ordering consecutively rows and columns with a similar sparsity pattern, and treating some zero entries of the reordered matrix as nonzero elements, and the nonzero blocks as dense, with a little sacrifi ce of memory. The reordering results in linear systems with blocks of variable size in general. Our recently developed parallel package pVBARMS (parallel variable block algebraic recursive multilevel solver) for distributed memory computers takes advantage of these frequently occurring structures {{in the design of the}} multilevel incomplete LU factorization preconditioner, and maximizes computational effi ciency achieving increased throughput during the computation and improved reliability on realistic applications. The method detects automatically any existing block structure in the matrix without any user’s prior knowledge of the underlying problem, and exploits it to maximize computational effi ciency. We describe a novel parallel MPI-based implementation of pVBARMS for distributed memory computers based on the block Jacobi, the additive Schwarz and the Schur-complement methods. We address hybrid MPI and OpenMP implementations and gain further parallelism using Many-Integrated <b>Codes</b> (<b>MIC)</b> technology. Implementation details are always critical aspects to consider in the design of sparse matrix algorithms. Therefore, we revisit our original implementation of the partial (block) factorization step with a careful selection of the parameters, and we compare different algorithms for computing the block ordering based on either graph or matrix analysis.
