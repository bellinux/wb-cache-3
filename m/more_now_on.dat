50|$|With its {{respected}} V series, Siku battled with French Majorette and Dutch Efsi for the European market, {{but became}} the diecast kings in the Matchbox size in Germany. Starting {{in the early}} 1970s, Siku started breaking into international markets with increasing success, and the company abandoned most other diecast products, focusing <b>more</b> <b>now</b> <b>on</b> vehicles (Natrop 1998-2002). While Sikus became well-known across Europe, the brand never became widely popular in the United States, only sometimes being found at specialty hobby shops. Appearances at large department stores like WalMart, Hills, or Target were rare. The American scarcity was despite offering American cars like the Buick Wildcat, Oldsmobile Toronado, Pontiac Bonneville convertible, Cadillac limosine, Pontiac GTO, Chevrolet Corvette, Lincoln Mark III, and Ford Mustang and Ford Trucks (Ragan 2000, 36; Natrop No date B). As of 2010 SIKU does not export toys to the United States due to conflicts with the CPSIA (The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act) of 2008.|$|E

60|$|Although {{they were}} {{drinking}} potheen, and though Ussher might, doubtless, {{have put a}} fine of from five to fifty pounds on the priest for doing so, Father John {{knew that he was}} safe. It was at that time considered that no revenue officer would notice potheen if he met it, as a guest. People are rather <b>more</b> careful <b>now</b> <b>on</b> the matter.|$|R
50|$|From a {{platform}} design perspective, the 10G is diverging {{in a few}} significant ways from the 1G platform. For instance, the interface standards for hardware IP were completely redesigned, relying on industry standards rather than homegrown protocols. Additionally the platform relies <b>more</b> heavily <b>now</b> <b>on</b> industry standard tools for dealing with design composition, automated register mapping, and managing the IP library, rather than custom scripts.|$|R
50|$|Another {{traditional}} {{activity in}} the sea is fishing. The Sea of Azov {{used to be the}} most productive fishing area in the Soviet Union: typical annual fish catches of 300,000 tonnes converted to 80 kg per hectare of surface. (The corresponding numbers are 2 kg in the Black Sea and 0.5 kg in the Mediterranean Sea.) The catch has decreased in the 21st century, with <b>more</b> emphasis <b>now</b> <b>on</b> fish farming, especially of sturgeon.|$|R

5000|$|The south (garden) front {{has four}} bays with ranges of four, three, four and two windows respectively. These are the {{original}} sash windows with wooden frames, {{installed in the}} 1930s. There are also three dormer windows above. The second and fourth bays project slightly, forming first-floor balconies. [...] On the north side, the front door (with a wheat-ear design, and again with a balcony above) faces the courtyard and some brick-bordered flowerbeds with automatic electric lights. Short columns (five {{on the west side}} and <b>more,</b> <b>now</b> hidden, <b>on</b> the east wing) separate the parking garages.|$|R
50|$|The {{mainstream}} full-sized Ford line of {{cars from}} 1960 to 1964 was now complemented {{by a variety of}} other Fords, including the Thunderbird and compact Falcon, and from 1962 the midsized Fairlane. So the mainline car grew even <b>more,</b> <b>now</b> riding <b>on</b> a 119 in (3023 mm) wheelbase. The engines were carried over from the 1959 Ford, as was the basic chassis design, but the sheetmetal was modern. The retracting Skyliner hardtop was gone, though the Sunliner convertible remained, and the Fairlane name would last only two years before migrating to a new midsize model.|$|R

50|$|Many of {{his works}} use world {{literature}} for their subjects. The dictates of socialist realism as they affected music starting in 1932 meant no great changes for him, since his style already was mostly in conformity with what was requested. He tended to select the topics of his programmatic works <b>more</b> often <b>now</b> <b>on</b> national topics, and let himself be influenced more often by musical and literary folklore. As a composer, Steinberg is today little known; it did not help that even {{at the time he}} was considered eclectic. More importance is attached to him now as a teacher.|$|R

According to the author, there are only few stores, which {{have some form of}} price promotions. He adds that <b>more</b> stores <b>now</b> focus <b>on</b> product.

40|$|International audienceAnti-angiogenic {{agents have}} {{modified}} therapeutic {{strategies in the}} management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Regarding molecules that already available such as sunitinib, sorafenib, temsirolimus and bevacizumab, clinical trials are <b>now</b> focused <b>on</b> the improvement of their effectiveness, overall survival, response's criteria and toxicity. In the light of recent data, these treatments will be tested in adjuvant situation to radical nephrectomy, but also as an alternative option to radical surgery. The place of radical nephrectomy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma has been recently strongly discussed. I n the future, the systematic radical surgery will not be a rule any <b>more.</b> From <b>now</b> <b>on,</b> renal cell carcinoma patients have to be included in numerous ongoing therapeutic trials to manage anti-angiogenic agents in the best manner...|$|R

5000|$|The tactics {{implemented}} by Ramelson mobilised militant trades unionists to organise within the labour movement. He opposed the 1971 Industrial Relations Act and {{fought for the}} release of the Pentonville Five. In 1972, he organised flying pickets during the miner's strike. Throughout the 1970s, there was broad crossover between trade unionist and Communist Party members and in 1973, Ramelson said: [...] "We have <b>more</b> influence <b>now</b> <b>on</b> the labour movement {{than at any time in}} the life of our party. The Communist Party can float an idea early in the year. It goes to trade union conferences as a resolution and it can become official Labour Party policy by the autumn. A few years ago we were on our own but not now." ...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of the GK-55 {{was the use of}} the [...] "Bolt-On" [...] neck which differentiated it from Les Paul's concept leaving it without the famous [...] "Les Paul" [...] monogram.

5000|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th century, {{probation}} officers {{were required to}} [...] "befriend" [...] offenders.

Critics {{complain}} that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the overarching idea of the “Global War On Terror”, were counterproductive, doing “more damage to ourselves than did the two-bit criminals who baited us” and “left the US weaker, more divided and broke”.

Finally Kuhler had to abandon free-lancing and to enter a position at American Car & Foundry (ACF) in 1944 where he developed double-deck sleepers, subway cars with standee windows and more. Most of his patents were applied for while at ACF. In 1947 he was given his termination notice in one of the many reshuffles at ACF.|$|R
