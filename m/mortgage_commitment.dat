40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze {{theoretically}} the problem of how mortgage lending institutions assume the interest rate risks inherent in the granting of fixed-rate mortgage loan commitments. Two approaches to hedge this risk are analyzed. First, the use of the GNMA futures market is evaluated from the standpoint of how it might be used to hedge against <b>mortgage</b> <b>commitment</b> risks. Secondly, the use of an appropriate pricing model-the Black-Scholes option pricing model-is offered as a proxy for establishing the market value of a fixed-rate <b>mortgage</b> <b>commitment.</b> This model is extended and empirically estimated for several hypothetical environments. The paper demonstrates a basic flaw in the GNMA futures market as a hedge against mortgage commitments. Once this is established, the use of the options pricing approach is offered as a more rational approach for hedging these risks.

40|$|Excerpt] Periodic {{flows of}} life {{insurance}} company (LIC) funds into the mortgage market result almost entirely from acceptances of forward commitment contracts negotiated months, and often years, earlier. Thus, Jaffee (1972) and others (Bisignano, 1971; Lintner, 1976; Lintner et al., 1978; Pesando, 1974; Ribble, 1973; and Smith and Sparks, 1971) have considered forward commitment behavior as the appropriate foundation for developing supply-of-mortgage-fund equations in large-scale econometric models and for analyzing the portfolio behavior of LICs {{and other financial}} institutions involved in issuing <b>mortgage</b> <b>commitments...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article uses {{data from}} the Canadian Family Expenditures Survey to {{estimate}} a life-cycle-consistent model of household labor supply and commodity demand that incorporates a mortgage qualification constraint based on earnings. Both the parametric and nonparametric implications of the model suggest that the labor supply of a nontrivial percentage of married women is constrained by <b>mortgage</b> <b>commitments.</b> The results of generalized selectivity models of female labor-force participation and labor supply show that {{the positive effect of}} a high debt service ratio exceeds the negative effect of young children.

40|$|The recent {{decline in}} house prices {{reminds us that}} the {{uncertainty}} in house prices may be substantial. This uncertainty is of fundamental concern to homeowners since buying or selling a home {{is one of the}} single most important financial decisions they make. This dissertation investigates house price uncertainty in the Netherlands from a homeowner’s perspective. Since house prices are uncertain, homeowners have expectations about them. The first part of this dissertation examines how the sale price expectations of homeowners are formed in relation to <b>mortgage</b> <b>commitment</b> and residential mobility. The second part considers the size of house price risk and whether it is possible to reduce this risk through, for instance, a financial market for house value. The results in this dissertation show that house price risk may be considerable. Consequently, there may be an important role for governments in raising the awareness about this ris...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates why the homeowner’s {{expectation}} {{about the}} sale {{price of a}} house deviates from its market price. This paper has two distinct contributions. First, we argue that sale price expectations are individual specific. Omitting this individual effect leads to biased hedonic estimates. As a result, hedonic estimates conditional on individual characteristics are preferred. Second, we economically interpret the individual effect in terms of inaccuracy of homeowners and {{a specific type of}} price setting behaviour (“fishing for a relatively high selling price”). In particular, we focus on the role of <b>mortgage</b> <b>commitment,</b> which is measured by the loan-to-income ratio. We argue that homeowners with a higher loan-to-income ratio are less likely to move. Consequently, they incur a low opportunity cost of fishing. They are also less inclined to search. As a result, homeowners with a higher loan-toincome ratio might have more incentive to fish for a higher sale price, but they may also be less accurate with regard to the market price. Our estimates confirm these two hypotheses...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on the labor supply {{decisions}} of married and cohabiting women {{in relation to the}} housing tenure choice decision. The main motivation for a joint analysis has been the relaxation of the mortgage qualification constraint. Since 1992 households can take out a mortgage on the basis of two incomes instead of one. Women may want to supply more labor to obtain a higher mortgage, {{but on the other hand}} higher <b>mortgage</b> <b>commitments</b> may constrain women to keep working. The empirical analyses, based on the Dutch Socio-Economic Panel, are performed within a static and a dynamic framework...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} link between homeownership and {{entrepreneurship}} using a model of occupational choice and housing tenure where homeowners commit a fixed budget to mortgage payments. Our model predicts that: (i) <b>mortgage</b> <b>commitments,</b> by amplifying risk aversion, diminish the likelihood that homeowners start a business; (ii) the negative link between homeownership and entrepreneurship is increasing in mortgage debt; and (iii) the negative relation is more pronounced for entrepreneurs in risky sectors. Exploiting the longitudinal dimension of the British Household Panel Survey to control for unobservables, we test and confirm these predictions. Leveraged home-buyers are 30 % less likely to become entrepreneurs...|$|R
50|$|In late April 1902 Pettit {{withdrew from}} the APCA, and {{continued}} to operate the school himself until it closed in February 1903. However, Pettit was unable to meet the <b>mortgage</b> <b>commitments,</b> and filed for bankruptcy on 29 August 1903 with debts of $26,483 and assets of $22,124. In 1904 Pettit was declared bankrupt. Rev.

40|$|This paper uses a {{structural}} model {{to address the}} question of why home-owners with large mortgage debt work longer hours than those without such debt. We consider whether this is due to lower net wealth or to capital market imperfections, including mortgage constraints that depend on current earnings and, therefore, labour supply choices. We show that the need to meet current <b>mortgage</b> <b>commitments</b> can generate the observed correlation, and this impact of current commitments arises from the institutional borrowing constraints. We also show that labour supply as a function of household debt is highly nonlinear: those with greater debt are more likely to face binding borrowing constraints and their labour supply is more variable. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we exploit loan level data {{combining}} foreclosure histories {{with information about}} the revenues and expenses associated with the ongoing management and eventual sale of financially distressed loans to estimate the magnitude of realized excess returns on commercial mortgages. Our findings are striking. We find that average realized excess returns on commercial mortgages are the lowest at the best times á la Stiglitz and Weiss (Am. Econ. Rev., 71 : 393 – 409, 1981). We also find that excess realized returns on commercial mortgages are low when lenders are swamped with funds (which we measure by the volume of commercial <b>mortgage</b> <b>commitments)</b> and when promised spreads are low.

50|$|New {{housing loans}} were introduced, {{such as a}} new 4.5% loan for those whose {{qualifying}} incomes were between $70 and $75 a week, plus $5 for each dependent child. An additional loan was also introduced for applicants who had a total income of less than 490 a week and were eligible to capitalise on the family benefit. Greater flexibility was extended to the State Advances Corporation “in determining the size of average loans “to be made available both at 3 and at 5 per cent.” In the first budget, a special fund was announced for refinancing mortgages where people had second and third <b>mortgage</b> <b>commitments</b> that were placing strains on the family budget. Rent Appeal boards were also set up to restrict the rights of landlords to make arbitrary increases in rents {{to protect the rights}} of tenants.|$|R

50|$|As {{it was not}} {{the legal}} owner of the assets of PCI, the Committee decided to abjure any {{responsibility}} for its debts and to open a new school in a different location, ultimately deciding to relocate to North Scituate, Rhode Island. After Pettit withdrew from the APCA, he continued to operate the school himself. Despite few of the faculty or students deciding to transfer their allegiance or enrolment to the new school, Pettit was unable to meet the <b>mortgage</b> <b>commitments,</b> and PCI closed in February 1903. Pettit filed for bankruptcy on 29 August 1903 with debts of $26,483 and assets of $22,124, and was declared bankrupt by 1904. Rev.

40|$|Spreads between {{yields on}} {{different}} mortgage instruments and comparable maturity portfolios of Treasury securities have been computed and compared with quoted yields over the 1974 - 82 period for three different mortgage instruments: GNMA pass-throughs, FHLMC participation certificates, and conventional <b>mortgage</b> <b>commitments.</b> The methodology explicitly {{accounts for the}} expected timing of the payments on the mortgages and thus avoids the cash-flow timing problems noted in the literature. Between late 1978 and 1981, the computed spreads rose by 30 to 40 basis points relative to those customarily quoted (the {{internal rate of return}} on a mortgage, assuming a twelve-year life, less the yield on near-par ten-year Treasuries). This increase {{can be attributed to the}} rise in the level of interest rates (the compounding error in quoted mortgage yields is larger at higher levels of rates) and the change in the slope of the yield curve from flat to downward sloping (the twelve-year prepayment date assumed in the computation of quoted GNMA and FHLMC PC yields seems to be too long).

They reached Bowen on 18 April 1861, where they founded Fanning Station. This was {{near the site of}} the Macrossan Bridge. Black was claimed to be the flrst man to cross the Burdekin River with flocks and herds. He liked the prospects of North Queensland {{and at the end of}} 1863, he took up a further large area of land, which became known as Woodstock Station. However, harsh conditions forced him and many others to surrender their lands to the banks as they were unable to meet their heavy <b>mortgage</b> <b>commitments.</b> Then aged 34, he became general manager for Robert Towns' pastoral interests, which included Fanning, Woodstock, Inkerman, Jarvisfield and other large holdlngs. Headquarters were established at Woodstock, and the long haulage of goods from Bowen was found troublesome. On the map it could be seen that the nearest coast was but twenty miles away. When Andrew Ball and Mark Watt Reid were sent to explore, they made the discovery of Ross Creek in 1864.|$|R

40|$|The {{securitization}} of fixed-rate mortgages {{suggests that}} the FRA/VA market was fully integrated with capital markets by the early l 98 Os and that the conventional market moved toward integration during the l 98 Os. Assuming full integration of FHA/VA 5 via the GNMA securitization process, we first estimate equations explaining near-par GNMA prices weekly for the 1981 - 88 period. The price is then set equal to the new-issue price and, based upon the preferred equation, the perfect-market retail coupon rate is computed. Next we estimate equations (for three year segments of the 1971 - 88 period) explaining conventional <b>commitment</b> <b>mortgage</b> coupon rates in terms of current and lagged values of this perfect-market coupon rate. Finally, we examine differences between the perfect-market and actual coupon rates and compute {{the impact of these}} differences on residential capital accumulation. ...|$|R
