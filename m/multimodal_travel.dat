40|$|Most travel {{behavior}} studies focus on discrete mode-choice outcomes. They predict {{the likelihood of}} traveling by a single mode (e. g. solo driving, carpooling, taking public transit, walking, biking). Yet qualitative studies focusing on low-income households suggest that their mode choice does not fit neatly into a single category; they regularly “transportation package,” use multiple modes of travel in a single day. We use data from the 2009 National Household Travel Summary to examine {{the extent to which}} individuals ’ engage in <b>multimodal</b> <b>travel</b> and to determine whether low-income individuals transportation package more than higher income individuals, controlling for other factors.

40|$|A {{majority}} of the trips are made by just one transport mode that is mostly the car, walking, or –in some countries– the bicycle. For {{a small proportion of}} the trips, generally a few percent, two or more modes are used. The latter include particularly trips where a collective mode (e. g. bus, train, airplane) is the main mode and the trip distance is rather long. In travel segments with high shares of collective public transport and rather long trip distances, the proportion of multimodal trips can exceed 50 %. Knowledge on volume and characteristics of multimodal trips is important, among others, for policymakers that aim at promoting public transport, for those who have to plan and design facilities at train stations and other nodes where people make interchanges, and {{for those who want to}} simulate <b>multimodal</b> <b>travelling</b> in transport models. Information on the use of transport modes, including multimodal use, is generally asked for in the national and regional travel surveys. Because of the relative complexity of multimodal trips, reporting on such trips is more troublesome and may be less accurate than reporting on unimodal trips. As a consequence, multimodal trips demand for more effort to achieve accurate information. Consecutively, the quality of the registration of multimodal trips may depend relatively strong on the set-up of the survey. The paper explores the impact of travel survey design on the quality of the registration of multimodal trips using survey data from the Netherlands. This country has a long tradition in surveying mobility behaviour; since the start in 1978 every year a large survey has been conducted. In the long period after 1978, the survey design has a few times been strongly adapted. The adaptations caused several trend breaks in registered travel behaviour, including huge changes in the performance of <b>multimodal</b> <b>travelling.</b> The paper analyses the relation between the survey design and the quality of the description of multimodal trips and gives some recommendations about how an accurate registration of multimodal trips can be achieved. It also shows which aspects of multimodality are rather robust with respect to survey design changes, and which aspects are highly volatile. The most prominent example of the latter is the registration of interchanges between vehicles of the same mode (e. g. the train); an accurate registration of such interchanges makes high demands on the set-up of the survey.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a system proposing {{a solution to}} the problem of Origin-Destination (OD) trip modelling for Multimodal Transportation Networks (MTN) using GIS tools. An efficient method for the handling of travel information within the MTN consists of dealing with an optimal multimodal routing of travellers from a point of origin to point of destination. Furthermore, the <b>multimodal</b> <b>travelling</b> alternative offers the promise of efficiency, safety and flexibility. It allows taking advantage of all modalities by using each transportation mode for the part of the journey to which it is best suited. Our aim is to propose an effective design for the multimodal path computation within the MTN. The goal is to provide a travel model that can aid to improve the user’s path decision, where travelling might involve different combination of rail, and route. Travellers can access information about all modes of public transportation and ridesharing available in their area, learn more about emissionless forms of transportation and find the fastest, safest routes to their destinations.

In this study, we investigate the interrelationships among traveler satisfaction, travel and traveler characteristics, and service performance in a multimodal network that comprises of a trunk line and its feeder lines. We analyze the factors influencing the choices of access to rail transit stations and the satisfaction of transit travelers with the rapid rail transit systems. We quantitatively study these relationships and demonstrate the complexity of evaluating transit service performance. Since the interrelationships among variables affecting this system are mainly stochastic, we analyze the satisfaction with transit system problem using a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN), which helps capture the causality among variables with inherent uncertainty. Using the case of Istanbul, we employ the BBN as a decision support tool for policy makers to analyze the rapid rail transit services and determine policies for improving the quality and the level of service to increase the satisfaction with transit system. In the case study, satisfaction with accessibility and access mode variables are found to be more effective variables than total travel time for travel time satisfaction, confirming the significant role of access in <b>multimodal</b> <b>travels...</b>|$|R

40|$|In the aim {{for a more}} {{sustainable}} transport system, governments try to stimulate multimodal trip making by facilitating smooth transfers between modes. The assessment of related multimodal policy measures requires transport models {{that are capable of}} handling the complex nature of multimodality. This complexity sets requirements for adequate modeling of <b>multimodal</b> <b>travel</b> behavior and can be categorized into three classes related to the range and combinatorial complexity of the choice set, the mathematical complexity of the choice model, and the complexity in demand-supply interactions. Classical modeling approaches typically fail to meet these requirements while state-of-the-practice approaches only partly fulfill these. Hence, the hypothesis {{of this study is that}} application of such models in network design implies an ill decision-making process. Both approaches are therefore compared with the theoretically sound super-network approach. Requirements for multimodality are constructed, and all three models are tested regarding how these requirements can be met. The findings of this comparison are supported by realistic examples in the real-world transport network of the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area. It is shown that the theoretical shortcomings of classical and state-of-the practice approach indeed result in incorrect predictions of <b>multimodal</b> <b>travel</b> behavior. The flexibility of the super-network approach, on the other hand, is capable of describing the expected impact of supply changes on travel behavior.

40|$|For {{making our}} cities and regions more attractive, clean, {{competitive}} and liveable, solutions for an intelligent urban mobility are necessary. Urban transportation and traffic developments {{all over the}} world show the huge demand for solutions in this field. Future urban mobility is based on an intermodal traffic system, which allows people flexible and <b>multimodal</b> <b>travelling</b> within the city. Therefore the capacity of public transportation as the backbone of urban traffic systems has to be extended for individual traffic modes. The integration of the motorised individual traffic and cycling – both also provided as sharing offers – will be one important factor. Not only technological innovations extend the opportunities of travel mode choice. A key factor is the focus on the user and its lifestyle-related mobility preferences, since functionality, sensible integration in urban fabric accompanied by a user-centred design and the easy access to mobility offerings are two important aspects in terms of usability. Developing mobility stations at strategically relevant traffic nodes – including at least two forms of public transport – is beside others one of the measures recommended by the International Association of Public Transport (UITP 2012 : 22). Due to its function and visibility within the urban space mobility stations could serve as the physical expression of future mobility. The central idea of a mobility station is the structural and spatial connection of functionality and design. As an important interface of public transportation and individual traffic modes the station needs to be organised as good as possible. Thus the size respectively {{the quality and quantity of}} features and offerings of each station depend on its location within the city. A basic requirement of mobility stations is the connection between different modes of transport including the availability of environmental-friendly forms of mobility. A sensible integration in the urban context along with a recognizable design of mobility station areas is the basis for developing an attractive urban space of high quality, which also serves as meeting point for people living in the neighbourhood and as a place of arriving, departure or change. Therefore mobility stations can in a second dimension serve as Bausteine to improve urban quality by reshaping the former traffic space...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to literature by showing how travellers that make normatively rational choices exhibit inertia during a series of risky choices. Our analyses complement other studies that conceive inertia {{as the result of}} boundedly rational or even non-deliberate, habitual decision-making. We start by presenting a model of risky travel choice based on Bayesian Expected Utility maximization premises. We show how inertia emerges due to a learning-based lock-in effect: travellers learn about risky attributes such as travel times and costs by observing the performance of a chosen alternative. Given risk aversion this implies that repeatedly choosing the same alternative from an initial set of equally risky alternatives is a rewarding strategy. We then extend our model to capture forward-looking behaviour and the availability of travel information: we show how inertia grows somewhat slower among forward-looking travellers, and how the provision of <b>multimodal</b> pre-trip <b>travel</b> information may somewhat reduce inertia growth, {{to the extent that it}} is reliable. Combining our findings with the large body of literature on inertia emerging from boundedly rational and habitual behavior, we argue that expectations regarding the potential of travel demand measures to counter inertia should be modest at best.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the usability and implementation of multifeature systems such as multimodal and multimedia user interfaces. Multimodal user interfaces support multiple interaction techniques which may be used sequentially or concurrently, and independently or combined synergistically [10]. New interaction aspects must be considered, such as the fusion and fission of information, and the nature of temporal constraints. The availability of multiple interaction techniques opens a new world of experience, but our understanding of how they relate to each other is still unclear. We here propose here a unified framework based on the notions of interaction language and physical device. The framework illuminates the relationship between interaction languages and physical devices. Such relationships are useful for eliciting design criteria, for classifying existing multifeature systems [Nigay 94] and for evaluating the usability of a system. In this paper, we focus on usability aspects and show how the usability of a system can be correlated with the relationships that the system is able to maintain between the interaction languages and the devices it supports. We then depart from the HCI perspective to consider the implications of such relationships on software techniques and tools.

The research follows a decision paradigm developed earlier, involving an information acquisition process for travel choices, and identifies the abstract characteristics of new information sources that deserve further investigation (e. g. by incorporating these in models and studying their significance in model estimation). A Stated Preference experiment is developed and the utility functions are formulated by expanding the travellers' choice set to include different combinations of sources of information. In order to study the underlying choice mechanisms, the resulting variables are examined in models based on different behavioural strategies, including utility maximisation and minimising the regret associated with the foregone alternatives. This research confirmed that RRM (Random Regret Minimisation) Theory can fruitfully be used and can provide important insights for behavioural studies. The study also analyses the properties of travel planning websites and establishes a link between travel choices and the content, provenance, design, presence of advertisements, and presentation of information. The results indicate that travellers give particular credence to governmentowned sources and put more importance on their own previous experiences than on any other single source of information. Information from multimodal websites is more influential than that on train-only websites. This in turn is more influential than information from friends, while information from coachonly websites is the least influential.

40|$|Transport {{planners}} and policymakers are increasingly considering multimodal public transport and travel demand management (TDM) strategies {{to stem the}} unsustainable travel behaviour trends associated with modern-day, car-dominated <b>travel.</b> <b>Multimodal</b> public transport, however, implies that people change transport mode, which may mean that {{they can no longer}} implement their usual activity patterns, perhaps even resulting in increased car use. The quality of public transport is determined not only by the quality of the main transport mode, but also by the before (access) and after (egress) modes. The interconnectivity of the different modes also becomes important in order to realise a trip. An important question from a policy perspective is, therefore, how people make decisions regarding location, activity scheduling and mode choice when faced with multimodal public transport alternatives. These decisions span different time horizons; the long-, medium- and short-term implications of multimodal public transport are addressed in the AMADEUS research programme, of which this dissertation forms part. National travel survey data for The Netherlands were used to address some of the research questions. An extensive activity diary data collection exercise was undertaken during April to September 2000 in the Utrecht-Almere-Amsterdam urban region of The Netherlands to collect detailed, multimodal activity-travel data. The data collection exercise relied on a specifically designed activity travel diary to capture the detailed stages of public transport. The results suggest that multimodal public transport users have distinctly different characteristics compared to other transport mode users. Considering the relationship between the different time elements, it was found that access, egress and line-haul times are not necessarily influenced by the same variables, while the interconnectivity ratio (access plus egress divided by total trip time) showed different distribution curves for different multimodal chains. Assuming that people make least uncertain decisions first, the results suggest that mode choice ranks lower on the chain of travel behaviour decisions and that individuals make activity scheduling and participation decisions before they make mode choice decisions. The results of this dissertation can be used to inform {{planners and}} policymakers about the implications of public transport and travel behaviour...|$|R

This paper, based on the park and ride behavior survey in Beijing, will analyze {{the relationship between the}} perception of the influencing factors and the behavior intent for park and ride by using structural equation modeling. The conclusions suggest that the park and ride choice for travelers is a passive behavior which means giving up driving the car is mainly caused by the serious traffic congestion. Furthermore, improving the service level of the park and ride facilities and the comfort for riding bus or railway will increase the utilization of park and ride facilities. The perceptions of the influencing factors have both direct and indirect effects on the travel intent for park and ride by the interaction among the influencing factors...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of research results obtained in the NWO/Connekt program ‘Behavioral aspects of a Personal Intelligent Travel Assistant’. First, it is put forward how PITA-research has formalized the role of information in traveler decision making by making use of the concept of Bayesian updating and choice set updating for travelers with different decision styles. Then, the results of computer simulations, and data-analysis based on a web-survey and a <b>multimodal</b> <b>travel</b> simulator are presented. Three important conclusions that may be drawn from the PITA-research effort performed so far are as follows: firstly, travelers’ need for personalized information from PITA-like services is predominantly motivated by the aim of making travel easier. Secondly, it appears that travelers are very well able to deal with complex choice situations involving multiple types of knowledge limitations and information provision in an intelligent, efficient manner. Thirdly, it appears that travelers’ actual use of provided information does increase the quality of their subsequent choices...|$|E
40|$|We discuss ongoing work {{investigating}} how humans {{interact with}} multimodal systems, focusing on how successful reference to objects and events is accomplished. We describe an implemented <b>multimodal</b> <b>travel</b> guide application being employed {{in a set}} of Wizard of Oz experiments from which data about user interactions is gathered. We offer a preliminary analysis of the data which suggests that, as is evident in Huls et al. 's (1995) more extensive study, the interpretation of referring expressions can be accounted for by a rather simple set of rules which do not make reference to the type of referring expression used. As this result is perhaps unexpected in light of past linguistic research on reference, we suspect {{that this is not a}} general result, but instead a product of the simplicity of the tasks around which these multimodal systems have been developed. Thus, more complex systems capable of evoking richer sets of human language and gestural communication need to be developed before conc [...] ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDiverse {{strategies}} {{have been proposed}} and implemented to relieve increasingly serious urban transportation problems. How to evaluate and optimize combined strategies to increase sustainability and improve efficiency of multimodal transportation systems is still a great challenge. This paper proposes a simulation-based systematic framework for sustainable transportation systems evaluation and optimization. Simulation-based optimization (SBO) is incorporated to seek an optimal combination of transportation planning and operations strategies, e. g. congestion pricing for private cars, bus and rail fares, to minimize generalized costs of multimodal traveling in a heuristic way. Applications in a small network of Tianjin Eco-city with multimodal travelers demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the SBO approach in sustainable transportation systems evaluation and optimization. The objective is to reduce <b>multimodal</b> <b>travel</b> costs subject to a minimum mode share of green transportation. The SBO process also validates that the efficiency of each strategy {{may be influenced by}} the strengths of other strategies...|$|E
40|$|Smart city {{applications}} in the Big Data era require not only techniques dedicated to dynamicity handling, but also {{the ability to take}} into account contextual information, user preferences and requirements, and real-time events to provide optimal solutions and automatic configuration for the end user. In this paper, we present a specific functionality in the design and implementation of a declarative decision support component that exploits contextual information, user preferences and requirements to automatically provide optimal configurations of smart city applications. The key property of user-centricity of our approach is achieved by enabling users to declaratively specify constraints and preferences on the solutions provided by the smart city application through the Decision Support component, and automatically map these constraints and preferences to provide optimal responses targeting user needs. We showcase the effectiveness and flexibility of our solution in two real usecase scenarios: a <b>multimodal</b> <b>travel</b> planner and a mobile parking application. All the components and algorithms described in this paper have been defined and implemented as part of the Smart City Framework CityPulse (www. ict-citypulse. eu) ...|$|E
