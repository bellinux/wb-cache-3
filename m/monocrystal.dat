50|$|Modern {{superalloys}} {{were developed}} in the 1980s. The first generation superalloys incorporated increased aluminium, titanium, tantalum, and niobium content {{in order to increase}} the γ' volume fraction in these alloys. Examples of first generation superalloys include: PWA1480, René N4 and SRR99. Additionally, the volume fraction of the γ' precipitates increased to about 50-70% with the advent of single crystal, or <b>monocrystal,</b> solidification techniques (see Bridgman technique) for superalloys that enable grain boundaries to be entirely eliminated from a casting. Because the material contained no grain boundaries, carbides were unnecessary as grain boundary strengthers and were thus eliminated.|$|E
5000|$|From a simple, {{classical}} standpoint, one may qualitatively {{understand the}} channelling effect as follows: If {{the direction of}} a charged particle incident upon the surface of a <b>monocrystal</b> lies close to a major crystal direction (Fig. 1), the particle with high probability will only do small-angle scattering as it passes through the several layers of atoms in the crystal and hence remain in the same crystal 'channel'. If it is not in a major crystal direction or plane ("random direction", Fig. 2), it is much more likely to undergo large-angle scattering and hence its final mean penetration depth is likely to be shorter. If the direction of the particle's momentum is close to the crystalline plane, but it is not close to major crystalline axes, this phenomenon is called [...] "planar channelling". Channelling usually leads to deeper penetration of the ions in the material, an effect that has been observed experimentally and in computer simulations, see Figures 3-5.|$|E

40|$|International audienceZnO {{nanowires}} grown in liquid phase are considered as promising {{building blocks for}} a wide variety of optical and electrical devices. However, their structural morphology is still limited by the lack of understanding of their growth mechanisms. We have systematically investigated the effects of orientation and polarity of ZnO <b>monocrystals</b> acting as substrates on the formation mechanisms of ZnO by chemical bath deposition. Under identical growth conditions, two-dimensional layers develop on nonpolar m- and a-plane ZnO <b>monocrystals.</b> In contrast, nanowires form on O-polar c-plane ZnO <b>monocrystals,</b> while more complex nanostructures including nanowires grow on Zn-polar c-plane ZnO <b>monocrystals.</b> All of the structures have homoepitaxially nucleated. Very specifically to chemical bath deposition, both O- and Zn-polar c-planes are found to be active, and no polarity inversion domain boundary is observed on O-polar c-plane ZnO <b>monocrystals,</b> allowing the growth of O-polar ZnO nanowires. These findings reveal the crucial role of crystal orientation and polarity in the growth of ZnO nanowires in liquid phase similarly to their growth in vapor phase. They further cast a new light on the general understanding of the growth of ZnO nanowires and enable the revisiting of their formation mechanisms in liquid phase on seed layers consisting of ZnO nanoparticles...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: The range of investigations comprised the production of <b>monocrystals</b> for tests, the determination of their crystallographic orientation, the deformation of selected <b>monocrystals</b> by compressing them within the temperature range from 20 °C to 400 °C at a strain rate of 10 - 5 sec- 1 to 10 - 1 sec- 1, as well as observations of the structures on an optical microscope. Findings: The analysis of the results of these investigations permitted to prove a considerable influence of the temperature, the strain rate and the crystallographic orientation on the metallographic effects of the work hardening of the CuZn 30 alloy with the orientation [9 3 1]. Practical implications: In the microstructures of the investigated <b>monocrystals</b> typical effects of plastic deformation were observed in the form of parallel cruciform lines and slip zones with locally intensified densities in various ranges of the cross-section of the sample and bands of deflection with weakly visible slip lines in the original system. Originality/value: The analysed microstructures of compressed <b>monocrystals</b> prove that the main mechanism of plastic deformation is the slide.
