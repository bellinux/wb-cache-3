50|$|Marathon {{is a major}} {{sport fishing}} destination, with several charter fishing boats departing from local marinas every <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Bountiful reefs around Marathon make it a popular diving, snorkeling, spearfishing, and lobster {{tickling}} area. One of the last untouched tropical hardwood hammocks in the Keys is found at Crane Point Museum, {{just a few miles}} west of Florida Keys Marathon Airport. The vicinity of the airport {{is one of the most}} reliable sites in the United States to see the hard-to-find Antillean nighthawk. Like the rest of the Keys in summer, gray kingbird are often seen on telephone wires along US 1 and black-whiskered vireo incessantly sing in the hammocks. Marathon also hosts burrowing owls.|$|E
5000|$|Rod Denson got {{his start}} in radio while a student at Thomas A. Edison High School in Elmira Heights. Station owner Frank Saia donated a half-hour of air time Saturday <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>both</b> local High Schools. Known as [...] "The Heights High School Show" [...] and [...] "The Horseheads High School Show". During each school's {{respective}} half-hour, a student from that school would play music from the Fabulous Fifty Chart, read announcements about upcoming school events, report sports scores etc. One Saturday morning Denson substituted for the school's regular host and his work so impressed owner Frank Saia,that he hired him part-time immediately after the show. Denson began working after that for one hour a week, the last hour before Sunday evening sign off. Denson eventually worked up to 20 hours a week part-time from October 1959 to 1961.|$|E

50|$|As Unca {{leaves the}} sailors {{let out a}} shout for joy and she returns to the Idol {{to think about what}} has happened. She cries over her own folly and worries that her cousin might be murdered until she is {{exhausted}} and seeks some refreshment. Walking to her provisions she is immediately met by her cousin who tells her that they will not let him on board the ship. He assures her that Captain Shore will attempt to calm down his crew and will return in the <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> take them <b>both</b> on board. Unca and her cousin sit down to eat and he relates the fantastical claim of the crew: that they had seen her fly, filling the air with the smell of brimstone. Captain Shore challenged their claims saying that they are mutineers, but the crew insists that they are not, they just refuse to have the She-Devil or her friends on board. Unca and Winkfield decide to return to the island in the <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> see what Captain Shore has accomplished with his crew.|$|R
60|$|They motored {{through the}} old-fashioned villages {{and along the}} quiet country lanes, towards where the wide-flung arms of the great city crept out like tentacles of hideous brick and mortar, to gather in her children. This <b>morning</b> ride was <b>to</b> <b>both</b> of them a never-ending source of delight. Jacob {{especially}} had {{the air of a}} schoolboy when he remembered the punctual train, his punctual appearance at the dingy warehouse in Bermondsey Street, his inevitable sallying forth, half-an-hour later, with a list of names in his pocket, a few samples of leather in his bag, and the stock phrases of the market packed into his head by the never-satisfied Mr. Smith.|$|R

60|$|After some {{hesitation}} {{the boys}} agreed <b>to</b> <b>both</b> these terms, {{and so it}} was decided that they were to go down the river. The steamer which they were to take was to sail at nine o'clock, and so they ordered breakfast at eight. Mr. George said that he would go down with them in the <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> the Broomielaw, and see them sail.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the effects of active warm-up {{duration}} on the diurnal fluctuations in anaerobic performances. Twelve physical education students performed a medical stress test (progressive test up to exhaustion) and four Wingate tests (measurement of peak power [P(peak) ], mean power [P(mean) ], and fatigue index during an all-out 30 s cycling exercise). The tests were performed in separate sessions (minimum interval = 36 h) in a balanced and randomized design at 08 : 00 and 18 : 00 h, either after a 5 min (5 -AWU) or a 15 min active warm-up (15 -AWU). AWU consisted of pedaling at 50 % of the power output at the last stage of the stress exhausting test. Rectal temperature was collected throughout the sessions. A two-way ANOVA (warm-up x time of day) revealed a significant interaction for P(peak) (F((1. 11)) = 6. 48, p 0. 05). P(peak) and P(mean) improved significantly from <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> afternoon after <b>both</b> 5 -AWU and 15 -AWU, but the effect of warm-up duration was significant in the morning only. Indeed, the values of P(peak) or P(mean) were the same after both warm-up protocols in the afternoon. For rectal temperature, there was no interaction between time-of-day and warm-up duration. Rectal temperature before and after both the warm-up protocols was higher in the afternoon, and the effect of warm-up duration on temperature was similar at 08 : 00 and 18 : 00 h. In conclusion, the interpretation of the results of the anaerobic performance tests should take into account time-of-day and warm-up procedures. Longer warm-up protocols are recommended in the <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> minimize the diurnal fluctuations of anaerobic performances...|$|R

50|$|Rachel White (Ginnifer Goodwin) is {{a single}} {{attorney}} working in a New York law firm. After too many drinks on her 30th birthday, Rachel grabs a cab with her friend, Dex (Colin Egglesfield), who is also her best friend Darcy's (Kate Hudson) fianc√©, and Rachel playfully reveals she has {{had a crush on}} him since law school. On the cab ride home, it is revealed that he has always felt the same and the two kiss. They wake up in bed together the next <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> Darcy calling <b>both</b> of their phones. Dex sneaks out before they can talk about what happened between them. Rachel initially believes the encounter is a one night stand, but it eventually develops into an ongoing affair. The couple soon find themselves lying to Darcy and others in order to cover up their relationship. Rachel tells Darcy that she is having an affair with another friend of hers, Ethan (John Krasinski) and an acquaintance, Marcus (Steve Howey) to cover up her sexual encounters with Dex. Ethan, who has been friends with both Rachel and Darcy since childhood, {{is the only one who}} knows what has happened between Rachel and Dex after figuring it out himself, and reluctantly agrees to keep their secret.|$|R
