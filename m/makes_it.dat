5|$|The Chronicles {{version of}} events <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> appear that Baldred was driven out shortly after the battle, but this was {{probably}} not the case.

This <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> likely that Beornwulf still had authority in Kent at this date, as Baldred's overlord; hence Baldred was apparently still in power. In Essex, Ecgberht expelled King Sigered, though the date is unknown. It may have been delayed until 829, since a later chronicler associates the expulsion with a campaign of Ecgberht's in that year against the Mercians.|$|E
