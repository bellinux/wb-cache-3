5000|$|<b>Marginated</b> <b>tortoises</b> are herbivorous, {{their diets}} {{consisting}} primarily of plants from their native Mediterranean region.|$|R
50|$|<b>Marginated</b> <b>tortoises</b> {{are fairly}} calm and relaxed, {{although}} {{they can be}} somewhat territorial in the wild. They have a controlled temper and are generally slow to anger. If they are not given the proper diet in captivity, however, they will become rather aggressive and might mistakenly attack if they feel threatened.|$|R
50|$|The <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoise</b> was {{formally}} described by German naturalist Johann David Schoepf in 1789; its specific epithet marginata is a straightforward derivation from the Latin term for 'marginated'.|$|E
50|$|The {{natural range}} of the <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoise</b> is {{southern}} Greece, from the Peloponnesus to Mount Olympus. They are also found in isolated zones of the Balkans and Italy, and northeastern Sardinia.|$|E
50|$|The <b>marginated</b> <b>{{tortoise}}</b> (Testudo marginata) is {{a species}} of tortoise found in Greece, Italy and the Balkans in southern Europe. It is the largest European tortoise, reaching a weight of up to 5 kg and a length of 35 cm. Its shell is oblong and has a notable thickness around {{the middle of the}} body. The posterior end of the shell has a saw-like formation, flanged outward like a bell. The carapaces of adult specimens are almost completely black, with yellow highlights. The front sides of the limbs are covered with large scales. The tail is notable for a lengthwise marking and for an undivided carapace over the tail. The <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoise</b> is herbivorous, and hibernates for the winter.|$|E
40|$|Testudo marginata, {{the largest}} European land tortoise, is {{suffering}} habitat degradation and destruction. Some populations, in markedly degraded habitats, {{are characterized by}} divergent morphotypes. However, the evolutionary significance of these morphotypes is of debate. Using 11 polymorphic microsatellites, we studied: (1) <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoises</b> from Sardinia that display a divergent morphotype this population was potentially introduced from Greece; and (2) an area in the southern Peloponnese that includes a small and degraded zone in which <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoises</b> are dwarf. Genetic analyses run without any a priori assignment clearly acknowledge the specimens sampled in {{the territory of the}} dwarf form as a single group whilst Sardinian specimens are clustered with other specimens from {{the northern part of the}} area sampled in Greece. Demographic analyses suggest that Sardinian tortoises originated recently from some of the populations sampled in the northern part of the area sampled in Greece. Over locations sampled in Greece, a landscape-genetic analysis allowed us to detect potential landscape features that may reduce gene flow between the dwarf form territory and surrounding areas. Our results suggest that the territory of the dwarf form is particularly propitious for <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoises</b> and that conservation regulations in Greece should be reinforced to protect this area from increasing impact of human activities changing from traditional agriculture to mechanization and extensive use of chemicals...|$|R
50|$|<b>Marginated</b> <b>tortoises</b> grow very rapidly. In {{an ideal}} biotope, or with good handling, they gain 100 - 500 g yearly. This quick {{rate of growth}} lasts {{throughout}} their youth. After the 20th year of life, further growth is minimal. They may live between 100 and 140 years, according to the best estimates of scientists.|$|R
5000|$|A {{population}} {{of small and}} light-colored <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoises</b> exists on the southwestern coast of the Peloponnesus, between Kalamata and south of Stoupa. The so-called [...] "dwarf marginated tortoise" [...] {{was described as a}} new species Testudo weissingeri, but it is not recognizably distinct phylogenetically. Unlike the Sardinian population, it occupies an extremely restricted range with very arid habitat, and its apomorphies seem related to this. Considering ice age-associated climate and sea level changes, this population is probably not older than a few thousand years; as it is not geographically isolated, it should be considered a local form, and not even a subspecies T. m. weissingeri. Notably, a similar situation is found in Hermann's tortoises living in the same region.|$|R
50|$|At {{the other}} extreme, animals from northeastern Turkey are very robust, such as Hermann's tortoise. The largest {{specimens}} come from Bulgaria. Specimens of 7 kg have been reported. In comparison, the Tunisian tortoise has a maximum weight of 0.7 kg (1.5 lb). Testudo graeca is also {{closely related to}} the <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoise</b> (Testudo marginata). The two species can interbreed, producing offspring capable of reproduction.|$|E
5000|$|The spur-thighed {{tortoise}} (or Greek tortoise) (Testudo graeca) {{is one of}} five species of Mediterranean tortoise (genus Testudo, family Testudinidae). The other four species are the Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni), Russian tortoise (Testudo horsfieldii), Egyptian tortoise (Testudo kleinmanni), and <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoise</b> (Testudo marginata). The {{spur-thighed tortoise}} is a very long lived animal, achieving a lifespan of upwards of 125 years, with some unverified reports of up to 200 years.|$|E
5000|$|Hermann's {{tortoise}} (Testudo hermanni) {{is one of}} five tortoise species {{traditionally placed}} in the genus Testudo, the others being the <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoise</b> (T. marginata), Greek tortoise (T. graeca, or spur-thighed tortoise), Russian tortoise (T. horsfieldii [...] ), and Kleinmann's tortoise (T. kleinmanni, or Egyptian tortoise). Two subspecies are known: the western Hermann's tortoise (T. h. hermanni [...] ) and the eastern Hermann's tortoise (T. h. boettgeri [...] ). Sometimes mentioned as a subspecies, T. h. peleponnesica is not yet confirmed to be genetically different from T. h. boettgeri.|$|E
5000|$|According to the 2005 DNA {{sequence}} data, {{these species}} {{do not seem}} to hybridize to a notable extent in the wild, though they are obviously very close relatives, and as evidenced by morphology, some allele flow still occurs, but slowly. The Egyptian tortoise appears to represent a lineage that diverged from the same ancestral stock southwards into northeastern Africa around {{the same time as the}} <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoise's</b> ancestors diverged in Greece. These two are actually more similar to each other than to T. graeca regarding DNA sequence data, but considering biogeography, this is either due to (rather unlikely) dispersal across the Mediterranean, or the supposed [...] "clade" [...] is invalid and the similarity due to convergent evolution.|$|R
50|$|The {{first two}} are more {{distinct}} and ancient lineages than the closely related latter three species. Arguably, T. horsfieldii belongs {{in a new}} genus (Agrionemys) {{on the basis of}} the shape of its carapace and plastron, and its distinctness is supported by DNA sequence analysis. Likewise, a separate genus Eurotestudo has recently been proposed for T. hermanni; these three lineages were distinct by the Late Miocene as evidenced by the fossil record. Whether these splits will eventually be accepted remains to be seen. The genus Chersus has been proposed to unite the Egyptian and <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoises</b> which have certain DNA sequence similarities, but their ranges are (and apparently always were) separated by their closest relative T. graeca and the open sea and thus, chance convergent haplotype sorting would better explain the biogeographical discrepancy.|$|R
5000|$|The {{proposed}} subgenus Pseudotestudo is invalid, {{based on}} immature characters. It {{has been proposed}} to unite this species with the <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoise</b> in the genus Chersus. These clearly share a common ancestor with the spur-thighed tortoise (Greek tortoise). The former two are somewhat more similar to each other than to the Greek Tortoise regarding DNA sequence data. Considering biogeography, however, this is either due to (rather unlikely) dispersal across the Mediterranean, or the supposed [...] "clade" [...] is invalid and the similarity due to convergent evolution.|$|E
50|$|The Sardinian <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoise</b> (T. m. sarda) is {{the name}} usually used to {{separate}} the population {{on the island of}} Sardinia. These tortoises have less strongly bent tiles in the posterior of their carapaces, and the posterior of the carapace is almost smooth compared with the saw-like T. m. marginata. Clearly distinct according to morphology and entirely allopatric, it cannot be distinguished by mtDNA cytochrome b and nDNA ISSR sequence analysis. Lineage sorting has not occurred to a considerable degree; consequently, the more geographically isolated Sardinian population is presumably of quite recent origin.|$|E
50|$|The <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoise</b> {{lives in}} more mountainous regions than Hermann's tortoise. It {{can be found}} in {{elevations}} as high as 1600 m. The black color of the carapace is helpful for survival in this environment, as it allows the tortoise to absorb a great deal of heat in a short time, helping it maintain its body temperature. Early in the morning, marginated tortoises bask in the sun to raise their body temperature, and then search for food. After feeding, the tortoises return to their shelters in the hot midday hours, leaving them again in the late afternoon.|$|E
50|$|One or {{two weeks}} before egg-laying, the animals become notably agitated, moving around to smell and dig in the soil, even tasting it, before {{choosing}} the ideal spot to lay the eggs. One or two days before egg-laying, the female takes on an aggressive, dominant behavior, mounting another animal as for copulation and making the same squeaking sound the male produces during copulation. The purpose for this behavior is to produce respect in the tortoise community, so that the female will not be disturbed by the others during egg laying. Further details of egg-laying behavior {{are the same as}} those detailed for the <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoise.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rare amphibians, {{found only}} on the island, are the Sardinian brook salamander, brown cave salamander, {{imperial}} cave salamander, Monte Albo cave salamander, Supramonte cave salamander and Sarrabus cave salamander (Speleomantes sarrabusensis); the Sardinian tree frog {{is also found in}} Corsica and in the Tuscan Archipelago. Among reptiles worthy of note are Bedriaga's rock lizard, the Tyrrhenian wall lizard and Fitzinger's algyroides, endemic species of Sardinia and Corsica. The island is inhabited by terrestrial tortoises and sea turtles like Hermann's tortoise, the spur-thighed tortoise, <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoise</b> (Testudo marginata sarda), Nabeul tortoise, loggerhead sea turtle and green sea turtle. A new arachnid species, endemic to the island, has been recently found: the Nuragic spider.|$|E
50|$|Testudo marginata is also {{closely related}} to the Greek or spur-thighed {{tortoise}} (Testudo graeca). Both have very similar bodily characteristics—oblong carapaces, large scales on the front legs, large coverings for the head and cone-like scales on the upper thighs, undivided tail coverings, moveable stomach plates, and lack of tail spikes. Presumably, Testudo marginata diverged from ancestral Testudo graeca as a population more suited for life in the mountainous regions. Evidence in favor of this is the wide geographical region and the extremely large number of subspecies of Testudo graeca, including a subspecies in Turkey with strongly bent carapace tiles, like the <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoise.</b> Testudo marginata on the other hand, despite the two subspecies, presents a much more unified appearance, which points toward an earlier appearance in evolutionary history. In captivity, the two species often cross-breed, but this should be avoided.|$|E
50|$|On Sardinia, a {{population}} of spur-thighed tortoises shares the small size, the yellow head spot, and the contrasting markings with the Tunisian population. Their taxonomic status is enigmatic, as is their very existence on the island, separated from North Africa by a considerable stretch of the Mediterranean which tortoises are hardly able to cross. There is a distinct local form of the <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoise</b> on the island, however, {{and that seems to}} have originated from a deliberate introduction by humans, perhaps by Greek or Roman landowners in the classical antiquity. While the local marginated tortoises show evidence of pronounced genetic drift and may thus justifiably regarded as a subspecies despite the absence of lineage sorting, the spur-thighed tortoises of Sardinia are probably best considered an introduced population not yet worthy of taxonomic separation pending further research.|$|E
50|$|The <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoise</b> is {{the largest}} European tortoise, {{reaching}} a weight of up to 5 kg and a length of 35 cm. Its shell is oblong and has a notable thickness around {{the middle of the}} body. The posterior end of the shell has a saw-like formation, flanged outward like a bell. The carapace of an adult specimen is almost completely black, with yellow highlights. The ventral shell is lighter-coloured and has pairs of triangular markings with the points facing the rear of the animal. The front sides of the limbs are covered with large scales. In an old female specimen, the rear flaps of the underside of her plastron is somewhat moveable. The tail is notable for a lengthwise marking and for an undivided carapace over the tail. The male has a longer tail, which is thicker at the base than the female's. The underside is more strongly indented. Males are also often larger than the females. The females lay their hard-shelled spherical eggs in the soil in May and June.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Cryptosporidiosis {{affects the}} {{gastrointestinal}} and respiratory tract of humans {{as well as}} {{of a wide range of}} companion, farm, laboratory and wild animals. In the past few years, three independent studies have provided strong evidence for the existence of a distinct Cryptosporidium species affecting tortoises and likely circulating in other reptile species as well. A new Cryptosporidium genotype was firstly detected and genetically characterized in a <b>marginated</b> <b>tortoise</b> in Italy in 2007 and named Cryptosporidium sp. ex Testudo marginata CrIT- 20. The phylogenetic analysis of this isolate indicated that this Cryptosporidium was unique and belonged to the intestinal clade. These findings were later on confirmed by the detection of genetic homologies of isolates from a python and a chameleon from Spain and by recent research in the United States. The latter study presented both the occurrence of intestinal lesions in a pancake tortoise and a Russian tortoise and the genetic characterization of the isolates, together with the first pictures of the endogenous stages of Cryptosporidium CrIT- 20. Phylogenetic inference based on the sequences representing small subunit of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (SSU) of these isolates confirmed the pathological findings because this Cryptosporidium was related to the intestinal group and supported previous results in T. marginata from Italy. The present scientific data on the Cryptosporidium CrIT- 20 support its classification as a new species of Cryptosporidium causing intestinal diseases in tortoises. Although further morphological (i. e. exogenous stages) and biological aspects (i. e. complete host range) are yet to be elucidated, it is proposed that this Cryptosporidium is designated Cryptosporidium ducismarci. </p...|$|E
