40|$|Autoclave and {{ethylene}} oxide-sterilized <b>membrane</b> <b>filters</b> {{manufactured by}} Gelman, Millipore, and Sartorius were field tested for their recovery of total coliforms, fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, and heterotrophs. The {{data were analyzed}} by using split-plot analysis of variance and significance tests. Membranes were also tested for pH and toxicity using Escherichia coli. The mean data summaries indicated that Gelman <b>membrane</b> <b>filters</b> generally produced the highest counts during the field studies. Statistical analyses of the March data showed that {{there were significant differences}} between <b>membrane</b> <b>filters</b> at 1 % level; however, statistical analyses of June data revealed no significant differences except in total coliform recoveries. Toxicity tests at 35 C indicated that Gelman and Millipore autoclaved <b>membrane</b> <b>filters</b> were able to recover 92 % of the test organisms. Toxicity tests performed at 44. 5 C revealed that no membranes were able to recover more than 40 % of the test organisms. Since differences were found in the ability of the three brands of <b>membrane</b> <b>filters</b> to recover bacteria from natural and controlled sources, <b>membrane</b> <b>filters</b> from different manufacturers cannot be readily interchanged. There is a need for a standardized procedure for testing bacterial recovery by <b>membrane</b> <b>filters...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to obtain {{accurate}} values of the gas permeability of the microporous layer (MPL), substrates with negligible MPL penetration and of known gas permeability, i. e. <b>membrane</b> <b>filters,</b> have been employed. The values of the MPL permeability obtained using the <b>membrane</b> <b>filters</b> were compared with those obtained conventionally using the carbon substrates. Due to MPL penetration, the MPL permeability obtained using the carbon substrate were found to decrease with carbon loading. On the other, due to negligible penetration, the MPL permeability obtained using the <b>membrane</b> <b>filters</b> {{were found to be}} almost invariant with the carbon loadings. Furthermore, the MPL permeability was found {{to be sensitive to the}} substrate used: more cracks (and subsequently substantially higher permeability) were shown by the MPLs coating the carbon substrates. This implies that the MPLs coating the carbon substrates and the MPLs coating the <b>membrane</b> <b>filters</b> are structure-wise different. It subsequently means that the MPL permeability obtained using the <b>membrane</b> <b>filters</b> cannot be used to estimate the MPL penetration into the carbon substrates...|$|R

40|$|Antimalarial {{activities}} of chloroquine, mefloquine, amodiaquine, and quinine in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum were diminished {{as a consequence}} of <b>membrane</b> filtration. <b>Filtered</b> drug solutions gave ID 50 values up to 25 -fold greater than those of non-filtered (ethanol-sterilized) drug solutions. Loss of activity by filtration was overcome by increasing the drug concentration prior to filtration.

Water filtrates from Nucleopore and Millex-GV filters showed no absorbance at 277 nm and only slight absorbance was evident for the Gelman filter unit.

The detection of esculin hydrolysis on <b>membrane</b> <b>filters</b> was not improved by using the new Millipore type HC filter.

30|$|Because {{of their}} low cost, high plasticity, high thermal {{stability}} and good mechanical properties, metal materials {{have been well}} studied for use as <b>filter</b> <b>membranes</b> with special wettability for oil–water separation. This special wettability {{can be achieved by}} coating the membranes with metal nets and a porous metal through physical and chemical methods. In 2004, Feng et al. [11] sprayed hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) onto a stainless steel mesh to create a superhydrophobic–superoleophilic <b>filter</b> <b>membrane</b> and reported that this kind of <b>filter</b> <b>membrane</b> was first applied in the oil–water separation field. Subsequently, many porous metal <b>filter</b> <b>membranes</b> with special wettability, fabricated through coating [12], surface oxidation [13] and chemical surface modification [14], were successfully used for oil–water separation. This paper briefly introduces the oil–water separation theory of <b>filter</b> <b>membranes</b> with special wettability and analyses the fabrication, advantages and disadvantages of oil–water separation porous metal <b>filter</b> <b>membranes.</b> The <b>filter</b> <b>membranes</b> are classified into three types according to their properties: <b>filter</b> <b>membranes</b> with superhydrophobic–superolephilic property, with superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic properties and with hydrophilic switchable wettability.
