I cannot and will not recant anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience. May God help me. Amen.|$|E
25|$|The Eastern Church {{attributes}} {{to the pope}} the most complete and highest power, however in a manner where the fullness and primacy are {{in harmony with the}} rights of the patriarchal sees. This is why, in virtue of and ancient right founded on customs, the Roman Pontiffs did not, except in very significant cases, exercise over these sees the ordinary and immediate jurisdiction that we are asked now to define without any exception. This definition would completely destroy the constitution of the entire Greek church. That is why <b>my</b> <b>conscience</b> as a pastor refuses to accept this constitution.|$|E

500|$|Throughout his cross-examination, {{prosecutor}} Hausner {{attempted to}} get Eichmann {{to admit he}} was personally guilty, but no such confession was forthcoming. Eichmann admitted to not liking the Jews and viewing them as adversaries, but stated that he never thought their annihilation was justified. When Hausner produced evidence that Eichmann had stated in 1945 that [...] "I will leap into my grave laughing because the feeling that I have five million human beings on <b>my</b> <b>conscience</b> is for me a source of extraordinary satisfaction", Eichmann said he meant [...] "enemies of the Reich" [...] such as the Soviets.

The mimic warfare of the evening became at last as wearisome to me as the routine of school in the morning because I wanted real adventures to happen to myself. But real adventures, I reflected, do not happen to people who remain at home: they must be sought abroad.|$|R

After a day of fasting, the Assembly took a vow, as directed by Parliament, to [...] "not maintain any thing in Matters of Doctrine, but what I think, in <b>my</b> <b>conscience,</b> to be truth". The divines organized themselves into three standing committees, though each committee was open to any member of the Assembly. The committees would be assigned topics and prepare propositions for debate in the full Assembly following each morning of committee meetings. In addition, over 200 ad hoc committees were appointed for tasks such as examination of candidate preachers, college fellows, and suspected heretics.|$|E

I remain committed to Christ as always but not to being 'Christian' or to being part of Christianity. It's simply impossible for me to 'belong' to this quarrelsome, hostile, disputatious, and deservedly infamous group. For ten years, I've tried. I've failed. I'm an outsider. <b>My</b> <b>conscience</b> will allow nothing else." [...] Shortly thereafter, she clarified her statement: [...] "My faith in Christ is central to my life. My conversion from a pessimistic atheist lost in a world I didn't understand, to an optimistic believer in a universe created and sustained by a loving God is crucial to me. But following Christ does not mean following His followers. Christ is infinitely more important than Christianity and always will be, no matter what Christianity is, has been, or might become." ...|$|E
500|$|After the war, {{many former}} Nazis fled to South America, {{especially}} to Argentina, {{where they were}} welcomed by Juan Perón's regime. In the 1950s, former Dachau inmate Lothar Hermann discovered that Buenos Aires resident Ricardo Klement was in fact Adolf Eichmann, who had in 1948 obtained false identification and a landing permit for Argentina through an organization directed by Bishop Alois Hudal, an Austrian cleric with Nazi sympathies then residing in Italy. Eichmann was captured in Buenos Aires on 11 May 1960 by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. At his trial in Jerusalem in 1961, he was found guilty {{and sentenced to death}} by hanging. Eichmann was quoted as having stated, [...] "I will jump into my grave laughing, because the fact that I have the death of five million Jews [...] on <b>my</b> <b>conscience</b> gives me extraordinary satisfaction." [...] Franz Stangl, the commandant of Treblinka, also escaped to South America with the assistance of Hudal's network. He was deported to Germany in 1967 and was {{sentenced to life in prison}} in 1970. He died in 1971.|$|E

500|$|Mary {{was convicted}} on 25 October {{and sentenced to}} death with only one commissioner, Lord Zouche, expressing any form of dissent. Despite this, Elizabeth hesitated to order her execution, {{even in the face of}} {{pressure}} from the English Parliament to carry out the sentence. She was concerned that the killing of a queen set a discreditable precedent, and was fearful of the consequences, especially if, in retaliation, Mary's son James formed an alliance with the Catholic powers and invaded England. Elizabeth asked Paulet, Mary's final custodian, if he would contrive a clandestine way to [...] "shorten the life" [...] of Mary, which he refused to do on the grounds that he would not make [...] "a shipwreck of <b>my</b> <b>conscience,</b> or leave so great a blot on my poor posterity". On 1 February 1587, Elizabeth signed the death warrant, and entrusted it to William Davison, a privy councillor. On the 3rd, ten members of the Privy Council of England, having been summoned by Cecil without Elizabeth's knowledge, decided to carry out the sentence at once.|$|E
500|$|Several suicides were {{connected}} to the campaign, including a Cuban gay activist in Miami named Ovidio [...] "Herbie" [...] Ramos, who was stunned at the vehemence against homosexuals. He and several other Cuban gay activists participated in a radio call-in show to hear people say homosexuals should be deported, forced into concentration camps, or executed. Ramos shot himself {{a few days later}} after telling a friend, [...] "I didn't know they hated us so much". Another Cuban gay activist named Manolo Gomez was fired from his job and severely beaten, after which he decided to leave Miami. Gay activists in New Orleans tried to discourage Bryant's performance with the New Orleans Pops orchestra by connecting local suicides to her campaign. Bryant responded to violence saying, [...] "It made me sad and shocked me that anyone would think I {{had anything to do with}} it, but <b>my</b> <b>conscience</b> is clear. I can't be responsible for how people react to what happened in Dade County. My stand was not taken out of homophobia, but of love for them." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{presentation}} of evidence against her, Mary broke down and pointed accusingly at Walsingham saying, [...] "all {{of this is the}} work of Monsieur de Walsingham for my destruction", to which he replied, [...] "God is my witness that as a private person I have done nothing unworthy of an honest man, and as Secretary of State, nothing unbefitting my duty." [...] Mary was found guilty and the warrant for her execution was drafted, but Elizabeth hesitated to sign it, despite pressure from Walsingham. Walsingham wrote to Paulet urging him to find [...] "some way to shorten the life" [...] of Mary to relieve Elizabeth of the burden, to which Paulet replied indignantly, [...] "God forbid that I should make so foul a shipwreck of <b>my</b> <b>conscience,</b> or leave so great a blot to my poor posterity, to shed blood without law or warrant." [...] Walsingham made arrangements for Mary's execution; Elizabeth signed the warrant on 1 February 1587 and entrusted it to William Davison, who had been appointed as junior Secretary of State in late September 1586. Davison passed the warrant to Cecil and a privy council convened by Cecil without Elizabeth's knowledge agreed to carry out the sentence as soon as was practical. Within a week, Mary was beheaded. On hearing of the execution, Elizabeth claimed not to have sanctioned the action and that she had not meant Davison to part with the warrant. Davison was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Walsingham's share of Elizabeth's displeasure was small because he was absent from court, at home ill, in the weeks just before and after the execution. Davison was eventually released in October 1588, on the orders of Cecil and Walsingham.|$|E

Outside this circle, Diamandy found himself isolated on the political scene, and was no longer proposed for an eligible seat in the elections of 1911, presenting a full report on his activities to his Tutova constituents. Revista Democrației Române survived until 1912, by which time Diamandy had decided to stay away from political journalism, [...] "since I only see fit to write as <b>my</b> <b>conscience</b> tells me to".|$|E

2500|$|In old age, Iorga {{had also}} {{established}} {{his reputation as}} a memoirist: Orizonturile mele was described by Victor Iova as [...] "a masterpiece of Romanian literature". George Călinescu referred to this series as Iorga's [...] "interesting" [...] and [...] "eminently subjective" [...] literature; [...] "dignified" [...] and dominated by [...] "explosions of sentiment", it echoes, according to Călinescu, the Renaissance model of Ion Neculce. Many of the volumes were quickly written as Iorga's attempt to rehabilitate himself after a failed premiership; Orizonturile comprises messages on the power and justness of his cause: [...] "And so I stand at age sixty-two, confident and strong, proud, upright in front of <b>my</b> <b>conscience</b> and the judgment of time." [...] The works offer retrospective arguments against Iorga's adversaries and sketch portraits of people who crossed Iorga's path—attributes which, Iova suggests, fully exploit Iorga's talents as a [...] "polemicist" [...] and [...] "portraitist"; according to Alexandru Zub, they also fall into place within the Romanian ego-history vogue, between Xenopol's and Pârvan's.|$|E
2500|$|Emily Caroline Brent, an elderly, religiously rigid, {{socially}} respectable spinster {{who accepted}} the vacation on Soldier Island {{largely due to}} financial constraints. Years earlier, she had dismissed her young maid, Beatrice Taylor, for becoming pregnant out of wedlock. Beatrice, who had already been rejected by her parents for the same reason, drowned herself, which Miss Brent considered an even worse sin. She refuses {{to discuss the matter}} with the gentlemen, telling them, [...] "I have always acted in accordance with the dictates of <b>my</b> <b>conscience.</b> I have nothing with which to reproach myself." [...] Later, she confides what happened regarding Beatrice Taylor to Vera Claythorne, who tells the others shortly before Miss Brent is found dead herself.

She, along with Vulcheva, are the only nurses who admitted knowing Ashraf by sight beforehand, but she said she had never spoken with him.
