40|$|In view of {{the high}} {{piezoelectric}} activity found on some cellular polymer electret films, polymeric space-charge electrets were studied more frequently during the last ten years. An alternative concept - between cellular electret materials and devices with non-porous electret films - are layer systems of porous and non-porous electret films. Such layer systems exhibit the typical properties of ferroelectrets. In the late nineties, there were several investigations on the charging behavior of porous PTFE, but the main research focus shifted to new cellular ferroelectrets such as polyolefins and polyesters. Today, the additional expertise with polymer ferroelectrets may help to study and better understand the charging behavior of porous PTFE films. In this contribution, <b>maximum</b> <b>charging</b> levels and thermal charge stabilities of porous PTFE films are analyzed. As expected, the charging behavior is strongly influenced by the porosity of the polymer film. Mechanisms that limi t the <b>maximum</b> <b>charging</b> levels - such as breakdown-induced conduction - are identified. The thermal stability of trapped charges is tested, and the light emission during the dielectric-barrier discharges of the charging process is briefly described...|$|R
40|$|Supercapacitors with aqueous {{electrolytes}} and nanostructured composite electrodes {{are attractive}} {{because of their}} high charging-discharging speed, long cycle life, low environmental impact and wide commercial affordability. However, the energy capacity of aqueous supercapacitors {{is limited by the}} electrochemical window of water. In this paper, a recently reported engineering strategy is further developed and demonstrated to correlate the <b>maximum</b> <b>charging</b> voltage of a supercapacitor with the capacitive potential ranges and the capacitance ratio of the two electrodes. Beyond the <b>maximum</b> <b>charging</b> voltage, a supercapacitor may still operate, but at the expense of a reduced cycle life. In addition, it is shown that the supercapacitor performance is strongly affected by the initial and zero charge potentials of the electrodes. Further, the differences are highlighted and elaborated between freshly prepared, aged under open circuit conditions, and cycled electrodes of composites of conducting polymers and carbon nanotubes. The first voltammetric charging-discharging cycle has an electrode conditioning effect to change the electrodes from their initial potentials to the potential of zero voltage, and reduce the irreversibility...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Dislocations are {{not only}} {{mechanical}} features of crystalline materials, but also complex electrosta-tic features this {{has important implications for}} understanding electrical and optical properties of real semi-conductor materials. An edge dislocation in a semiconductor material becomes electrically charged when free electrons migrate to the dangling bonds along the core the line charge along the core is then partially screened by the background free carrier concentration. In this work we consider the atomistic structure of an edge dislocation in a technologically important compound semiconductor material, GaN, and develop a complete continuum model of the electrostatic structure of the dislocation. The atomistic analysis is used to determine the <b>maximum</b> <b>charged</b> state of the dislocation core according to first principles electronic structure analysis the <b>maximum</b> <b>charged</b> state is then expressed as a continuum electrostatic potential. By formulating an energy balance model {{as a function of the}} incremental filling of electron acceptor sites, the equilibrium electrostatic state of the dislocation is then determined. This electrostatic state can then be used as the basis for predictive models of electrical scattering or optical absorption.
