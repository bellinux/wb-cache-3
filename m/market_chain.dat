40|$|We {{applied a}} {{two-stage}} value chain model {{to investigate the}} effects of input application and occasional transaction costs on vegetable <b>marketing</b> <b>chain</b> efficiencies with a farm household-level data set. In the first stage, the production efficiencies with the combination of resource endowments, capital and managerial inputs, and production techniques were evaluated; then at the second stage, the marketing technical efficiencies were determined under the marketing value of the vegetables for three typical <b>marketing</b> <b>chains</b> in Nanjing area, P. R. China. The impacts of the transaction costs to the supply chain technical efficiency both at the production and marketing stages were examined by using Tobit model. Study showed that transaction costs significantly impacts on vegetable <b>marketing</b> <b>chain</b> efficiency in research area. Results also revealed that the impacts of transaction costs on <b>marketing</b> <b>chain</b> efficiency differ cross chains.

Result of research shows four patterns of <b>marketing</b> <b>chain.</b> The first <b>marketing</b> <b>chain</b> is farmer/producer ? wholesaler ? retailer ? consumer. The second <b>marketing</b> <b>chain</b> is farmer/producer & wholesaler ? RPA ? retailer ? consumer. The third <b>marketing</b> <b>chain</b> is farmer/producer ? wholesaler ? restaurant ? consumer.

The result of marketing margin analysis indicates that the margin distribution of first chain is 26. 52 %, while those of second, third and fourth chain are 28. 08 %, 13. 36 % and 32. 04 %. Farmers share in first chain is 44. 72 %, while those in second, third and fourth chain are 43. 57 %, 61. 56 % and 40. 22 %. Profit share per cost of each farmer is similar in rate of 0. 08.

40|$|The {{issue of}} market {{power in the}} Australian food <b>marketing</b> <b>chain</b> is of {{continuing}} and growing concern. Contributing factors include sharply rising retail food prices in recent years together with relatively stable farm prices, and thus increasing marketing margins; high and increasing concentration in the retail food sector, where the two largest supermarket chains account for {{a large percentage of}} total national grocery sales; and the legacy of past deregulation of agricultural marketing institutions and trade liberalisation. In this paper an updated quantitative analysis of the competitive behaviour of the <b>marketing</b> <b>chains</b> for beef, lamb, pork and chicken, from farm gate to retail, is reported.

40|$|The {{smallholder}} dairy farmers’ {{access to}} modern milk <b>marketing</b> <b>chain</b> has been assessed in India by collecting data {{at the farm}} level in two states, viz. Bihar and Punjab. These states are among the largest milk producing states of the country but depict stark variations in terms of milk productivity and per capita milk availability. Another significant feature is the emergences of modern milk <b>marketing</b> <b>chains</b> in both the states. The study has shown {{that in spite of}} the growing presence of modern milk supply chains, the traditional milk supply chain is still dominant in the Indian milk market. Its presence is even more pronounced in less-developed states like Bihar. However, the traditional milk supply chain is being replaced, albeit slowly, with the commercialization of dairying. The structure of the milk marketing in Punjab has depicted this conclusion. The study has concluded that the modern milk supply chain seems to have an inclusive structure and the resource-poor dairy farmers are not excluded from the modern milk supply chain. The study has argued that the traceability and food safety issues will further strengthen the modern milk supply chain. The scalability of the modern milk supply chain will depend on the development of milk collection and transportation facilities and incentive pricing for a quality produce.
