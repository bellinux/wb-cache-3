5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1907, Baden-Powell went on an {{extensive}} speaking tour arranged by his publisher, Arthur Pearson, to promote his forthcoming book, Scouting for Boys. He had not simply rewritten his Aids to Scouting; he omitted the <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> and transferred the techniques (mainly survival) to non-military heroes: backwoodsmen, explorers (and later on, sailors and airmen). He also added innovative educational principles (the Scout method) by which he extended the attractive game to a personal mental education.|$|E
5|$|The revisionist {{tradition}} {{continues to}} the present time, through popular history books, web sites and wargames. New titles appear every year, propagating the myths first put forth by HIAG's propaganda efforts. Some of the books are amateur historical studies that focus solely on the <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of the Waffen-SS. Others are reprints of apologetic accounts by former Waffen-SS personnel. Adding to the volume of material are groups of international admirers who consider Waffen-SS to have been incorrectly judged by history.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Charles Coulson {{the accumulation}} of wealth and resources, such as food, led {{to the need for}} defensive structures. The earliest fortifications originated in the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. Northern Europe was slower than the East to develop defensive structures and {{it was not until the}} Bronze Age that hill forts developed and began to spread across Europe. In the medieval period castles were influenced by earlier forms of elite architecture, contributing to regional variations. Importantly, while castles had <b>military</b> <b>aspects,</b> they contained a recognisable household structure within their walls, reflecting the multi-functional use of these buildings.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{domestic}} {{debate over the}} permanent management of the nuclear program, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{was created by the}} Atomic Energy Act of 1946 to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project. It established civilian control over atomic development, and separated the development, production and control of atomic weapons from the military. <b>Military</b> <b>aspects</b> were taken over by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). Although the Manhattan Project ceased to exist on 31 December 1946, the Manhattan District would remain until it too was abolished on 15 August 1947.|$|E

5|$|Initially the Order was a knightly brotherhood (Rittersbruderschaft), {{reflecting}} the overlapping religious and <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of medieval court life. Saint Hubert was {{the patron saint}} of hunters and knights. The founding of the Order of the Golden Fleece in the early 15th century started a trend in confraternal princely orders. The purpose of these, whether established by monarchs or princes, was to foster loyalty to a sovereign, replacing to the old Chivalric orders developed in the Crusades. Although some historians classify the Order of the Saint Hubert as a confraternal order, during its 600-year-life, its purpose changed as the fortunes and needs of the Dukes of Jülich and Berg and their successors changed.|$|E

5|$|Responsibility {{for nuclear}} power {{and nuclear weapons}} was {{transferred}} from the Manhattan District to the United States Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947. On 29 January 1947, Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson and Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal issued a joint directive creating the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP) to control the <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of nuclear weapons. Groves was appointed its chief on 28 February 1947. In April, AFSWP moved from the New War Department Building to the fifth floor of the Pentagon. Groves had already made a start on the new mission by creating Sandia Base in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 {{created the}} Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{to take over}} the {{functions}} and assets of the Manhattan Project. President Harry S. Truman appointed its five commissioners on 28 October 1946, and Groves appointed Nichols as the military liaison officer to the AEC. Nichols' main responsibility was to help organize an orderly transfer of assets and responsibilities from the MED to the AEC. <b>Military</b> <b>aspects</b> were taken over by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). It was generally assumed that Nichols would become the AEC's Director of Military Application, but while Nichol's relationship with the AEC was cordial and the commissioners were impressed with his administrative skills, it also became clear that Nichols did not agree with the commissioners' concept of the Director of Military Application as a staff rather than a line function.|$|E
5|$|The museum's {{library is}} a {{national}} reference collection on modern conflict, and holds works on all aspects of warfare, including regimental or unit histories (such as 789 rare German unit histories from the First World War), technical manuals, biographical material and works on war's social, cultural, economic, political and <b>military</b> <b>aspects.</b> The library also holds printed ephemera such as the Imperial War Museum Stamp Collection, leaflets and ration books, printed proclamations, newspapers, trench magazines (such the Wipers Times) and trench maps. In 2012 the museum reported its library collection to contain over 80,000 items of historic importance (such as maps, proclamations and rare books) and a further 254,000 items of reference material.|$|E
50|$|As in {{the case}} of {{national}} power, the <b>military</b> <b>aspect</b> of security is an important, but not the sole, component of national security. To be truly secure, a nation needs other forms of security. Authorities differ in their choice of nation security elements. Besides the <b>military</b> <b>aspect</b> of security, the aspects of diplomacy or politics; society; environment; energy and natural resources; and economics are commonly listed. The elements of national security correlate closely to the concept of the elements of national power. Romm (1993) lists security from narcotic cartels, economic security, environmental security and energy security as the non-military elements of national security.|$|R

5|$|After the war, Groves {{remained}} {{in charge of}} the Manhattan Project until responsibility for nuclear weapons production was handed over to the United States Atomic Energy Commission in 1947. He then headed the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, which had been created to control the <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of nuclear weapons. He was given a dressing down by the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, and told that he would never be appointed Chief of Engineers. Three days later, Groves announced his intention to leave the Army. He was promoted to lieutenant general just before his retirement on 29 February 1948 in recognition of his leadership of the bomb program. By a special Act of Congress, his date of rank was backdated to 16 July 1945, the date of the Trinity nuclear test. He {{went on to become a}} vice-president at Sperry Rand.|$|E

25|$|In 1995–96, a NATO-led {{international}} {{peacekeeping force}} (IFOR) of 60,000 troops served in Bosnia and Herzegovina, beginning on December 21, 1995 to implement and monitor the <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of the Dayton Peace Agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization Force or SFOR. The number of SFOR troops was reduced first to 12,000 {{and then to}} 7,000.

25|$|Defeat meant {{acceptance}} of Union {{and the search}} for an identity that was Unionist but also uniquely Scottish. One aspect was converting Highlanders from half-naked savages into a noble warrior race. For decades before 1745, rural poverty drove many to enlist in European armies but while military experience was common, the <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of clanship itself had been in decline for many years. Foreign service was banned after 1745 and recruitment into the British Army accelerated as deliberate policy. Britain was at war for 43 of the years between 1756 and 1815 with Scotland providing disproportionate numbers of recruits. During Empire, British policy makers focused recruiting on a small number of so-called 'martial races,' a category including Highlanders, Sikhs, Dogras and Gurkhas. In many ways, this view remains with us today.|$|E
25|$|The Russians {{suffered}} a great {{defeat in the}} Battle of Warsaw in mid-August 1920 and started withdrawing. They handed over Vilnius to the Lithuanians on August 26. The Lithuanians hastily made preparations to secure the border, {{as determined by the}} Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty. The soldiers were ordered to maintain neutrality: avoid hostilities and intern any Soviet or Polish troops that would cross the border. On August 26, a Polish delegation, led by colonel Mieczysław Mackiewicz, arrived in Kaunas to negotiate the situation. The Poles, lacking authority to discuss political issues, were concerned with <b>military</b> <b>aspects.</b> They sought permission to transport Polish troops through the territory of Lithuania, wanted access to a portion of the Warsaw – Saint Petersburg Railway, and demanded that the Lithuanian troops would withdraw from the Suwałki Region behind the Curzon Line. The Lithuanians refused to discuss military matters without a clear political Polish–Lithuanian border, that would be respected after the war. Due to these fundamental disagreements and Polish attacks, the negotiations broke down on August 30.|$|E
25|$|The meeting {{took place}} on 19 July in the villa of Senator Achille Gaggia in Feltre, near Belluno. There Mussolini, Bastianini and Ambrosio met with Hitler and the generals of the OKW to discuss the {{situation}} and the possible countermeasures. The German delegation was full of generals, but neither Goering nor Ribbentrop were present, showing that the Germans were focusing on the <b>military</b> <b>aspects</b> of the situation. Ambrosio prepared for the meeting meticulously, and the day before spoke plainly to Mussolini, telling him that his duty was to exit {{the war in the}} next 15 days. The Germans, on the other hand, had lost faith in the Italians and were only interested in occupying northern and central Italy, leaving the Italian army alone to defend the country from the Allies. Moreover, they proposed that the Axis supreme command in the peninsula be taken over by a German general (possibly Rommel). The first two hours of the meeting were as usual a monologue by Hitler, blaming the Italians for their weak military performance and asking for draconian measures: Mussolini was unable to speak a word. The meeting was suddenly interrupted when an Italian aide came into the room and told Mussolini that at that moment the Allies were for the first time heavily bombing Rome. During the lunch pause, Ambrosio and Bastianini pressed the Duce to tell Hitler that for Italy a political solution to the war was necessary, but Mussolini replied that he had been tormented for months by the dilemma of leaving the alliance or continuing the war: in reality, Mussolini could not overcome the sense of inferiority he felt in the presence of Hitler , and did not have the courage to speak frankly with his German colleague.|$|E
