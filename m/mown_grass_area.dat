The Millennium Green has two areas: a nature reserve with board walk and a <b>mown</b> <b>grass</b> <b>area</b> for general {{recreation}} isbordered by a gravel path. It has also hosted several events, including the burning of a beacon and Colne Valley Festival events.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{situated}} in Fellmonger Park, which consists of <b>mown</b> <b>grassed</b> <b>areas,</b> and an undulating land surface with several mounded areas with mulched tree plantings on top. The land drops to low-lying flats towards Hilliards Creek which become flooded after heavy and prolonged rain. The park's vegetation includes eucalypts, cassia and other species in planted gardens and as isolated specimens. Melaleuca (ti-tree) occur along the creek banks and on the creek flats.|$|R
50|$|Yarran Dheran is an {{important}} riparian bushland park, located in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne in Mitcham {{on the border of}} Donvale, {{on the banks of the}} Mullum Mullum Creek. The park comprises 7.2 hectares and hosts a mix of remnant and regenerative bushland, and many native species of wildlife, particularly birds, of which there are over 85 species living in the park. The Mullum Mullum Creek Trail runs through the park and there are many small unsealed bush tracks through the native bushland. There is a visitors centre near the middle of the park, toilets and many <b>mown</b> <b>grassed</b> <b>areas</b> for picnics and seating.|$|R

40|$|Rain {{gardens are}} {{increasingly}} adopted {{in urban areas}} to mitigate urban stormwater impacts. They {{provide an opportunity to}} adopt taxonomically diverse plantings to enhance habitat and aesthetic value. However, few studies to date have quantified how rain garden hydrological performance is affected by vegetation type. In the present study, two vegetation types were considered: taxonomically diverse communities composed of forb-rich perennials; and <b>mown</b> <b>grasses,</b> as well as a bare soil control group. Detention effects were measured independently from retention. The forb-rich perennial mixes consistently provided the best hydrologic performance in terms of both stormwater retention and detention. The diverse perennial community showed up to 1. 2 mm higher initial losses over the experimental catchment compared with <b>mown</b> <b>grasses,</b> and also offered 54 and 32 % longer detention compared with bare soils and <b>mown</b> <b>grasses</b> respectively. We therefore recommend prioritising taxonomically and structurally diverse planting for vegetated stormwater management facilities wherever possible...|$|R

40|$|Sports {{fields are}} mown {{primarily}} {{to provide a}} uniform surface for ball roll and bounce. However, mowing creates openings that facilitate water loss and entry points for pathogens, and increases susceptibility to other stresses. The objectives of our research were to identify physiological mechanisms that allow creeping bentgrass to tolerate close and frequent mowing. Plants often increase formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to wounding. Accumulation of ROS may damage macromolecules such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Damage to these macromolecules may result in reduced plant growth and vigor, or even death. Plants form enzymes to quench ROS and protect cells from oxidative damage. However, activities of ROS-scavenging enzymes often are reduced during stress. In our research, activities of the ROS-quenching enzymes catalase and ascorbate peroxidase were reduced in <b>mowed</b> <b>grasses.</b> Reduced activities of these enzymes may result in accumulation of ROS. However, no differences were observed in levels of lipid peroxidation between not-cut and <b>mowed</b> <b>grasses,</b> indicating that accumulation of ROS was not sufficient to cause severe oxidative stress. Although toxic at high concentrations, ROS may act {{as a component of}} a signal transduction pathway that acclimates not-stressed tissue to potential stress. It is necessary for grasses to regrow leaf tissue removed by mowing. Reserve carbohydrates often are hydrolyzed to generate carbon for respiration and to provide substrates for development of leaf and shoot tissue. Creeping bentgrass forms fructans as reserve carbohydrates. In our research, fructans were reduced in <b>mown</b> <b>grasses</b> compared to not-cut grasses. Glucose levels also were reduced in <b>mowed</b> <b>grasses</b> compared to not-cut grasses. Glucose likely was oxidized in the glycolytic pathway and respiration to provide energy for formation of new leaf tissue. It {{is important to remember that}} mowing is a stress and that mowing programs should balance agronomic requirements of grasses with sports play demands in order to produce uniform and visually appealing turf that is vigorous in growth...|$|R

40|$|With some raptors showing {{widespread}} declines, {{management of}} grassland to enhance {{access to their}} small mammal prey {{may be an important}} conservation tool. Many small mammal species prefer long grass as a habitat that offers protection from predation, and past studies on the consequences of grass cutting to small mammals have yielded mixed results. Using live trapping, we show that although <b>mowing</b> <b>grass</b> causes a rapid decline in small mammal captures, a small proportion of captures (20 %- 27 %) still occurred in patches of <b>mown</b> <b>grass</b> immediately after cutting. This proportion more than halved again when the cut grass that was initially left in situ was removed. We conclude that some small mammals may remain in mown areas provided some form of cover - i. e. the cut grass - is present. These findings are discussed in light of agri-environment scheme options (e. g. grass margins) that could be improved to benefit birds of prey...|$|R
