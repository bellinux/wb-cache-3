5000|$|The general {{structure}} of polymeric ELPs is (VPGXG)n, where the <b>monomeric</b> <b>unit</b> is Val-Pro-Gly-X-Gly, and the “X” denotes a variable amino acid {{that can have}} consequences on the general properties of the ELP, such as the transition temperature (Tt). Specifically, the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity and {{the presence or absence}} of a charge on the guest residue play a great role in determining the Tt. Also, the solubilization of the guest residue can effect the Tt. The [...] "n" [...] denotes the number of monomeric units that comprise the polymer.

5000|$|Relying {{solely on}} the {{structural}} information of organolithium aggregates obtained in the solid state from crystal structures has certain limits, as {{it is possible for}} organolithium reagents to adopt different structures in reaction solution environment. Also, in some cases the crystal structure of an organolithium species can be difficult to isolate. Therefore, studying the structures of organolithium reagents, and the lithium-containing intermediates in solution form is extremely useful in understanding the reactivity of these reagents. NMR spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for the studies of organolithium aggregates in solution. For alkyllithium species, C-Li J coupling can often used to determine the number of lithium interacting with a carbanion center, and whether these interactions are static or dynamic. Separate NMR signals can also differentiate the presence of multiple aggregates from a common <b>monomeric</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E

25|$|Rubber {{particles}} are {{formed in the}} cytoplasm of specialized latex-producing cells called laticifers within rubber plants. Rubber {{particles are}} surrounded by a single phospholipid membrane with hydrophobic tails pointed inward. The membrane allows biosynthetic proteins to be sequestered at {{the surface of the}} growing rubber particle, which allows new <b>monomeric</b> <b>units</b> to be added from outside the biomembrane, but within the lacticifer. The rubber particle is an enzymatically active entity that contains three layers of material, the rubber particle, a biomembrane and free <b>monomeric</b> <b>units.</b> The biomembrane is held tightly to the rubber core due to the high negative charge along the double bonds of the rubber polymer backbone. Free <b>monomeric</b> <b>units</b> and conjugated proteins make up the outer layer. The rubber precursor is isopentenyl pyrophosphate (an allylic compound), which elongates by Mg2+-dependent condensation by the action of rubber transferase. The monomer adds to the pyrophosphate end of the growing polymer. The process displaces the terminal high-energy pyrophosphate. The reaction produces a cis polymer. The initiation step is catalyzed by prenyltransferase, which converts three monomers of isopentenyl pyrophosphate into farnesyl pyrophosphate. The farnesyl pyrophosphate can bind to rubber transferase to elongate a new rubber polymer.|$|R

5000|$|The {{transition}} temperature of an ELP depends {{to a certain}} extent on the identity of the [...] "X" [...] residue found at the fourth position of the pentapeptide <b>monomeric</b> <b>unit.</b> Residues that are highly hydrophobic, such as leucine and phenylalanine, tend to decrease the {{transition temperature}}. On the other hand, residues that are highly hydrophilic, such as serine and glutamine, tend to increase the transition temperature. The presence of a potentially charged residue at the [...] "X" [...] position will determine how the ELP responds to varying pHs, with glutamic acid and aspartic acid raising the Tt [...] at pH values in which the residues are deprotonated and lysine and arginine raising the Tt [...] at pH values in which the residues are protonated. The pH needs to be compatible with the charged states of these amino acids in order to raise the Tt. Also higher molecular mass ELPs and higher concentrations of ELPs in solution make it much easier for the polymer to form aggregates, in effect lowering the experimental Tt.|$|E
5000|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of hibarimicinone {{was initially}} hypothesized {{to be produced}} from a polyketide synthase. Through 13C-labelling and blocked mutants of the TP-A0121 strain, Oki et al. demonstrated that hibarimicinone is produced by an oxidative coupling of two tetracyclic polyketides, which undergo an oxidative cyclization to generate the ether ring. [...] The hibarimicinone monomer is formed initially by a Type II polyketide synthase. The 22 carbon chain is initiated by butyryl-CoA and its decarboxylative addition to a malonyl-CoA derived two carbon ketide unit. The KS/CLF binds to the starting butyryl-CoA, freeing the ACP domain to bind to another malonate group from malonyl-CoA. Thioester exchange occurs between the KS/CLF and the ACP; the cycle then repeats nine more times to produce the full carbon chain (1). Multiple aldol additions occur to form four six-membered cyclization and aromization (2). The CLF/KS subunit is cleaved off by a thioesterase and modified by numerous steps (four oxidations, two NADPH dependent reductions, two methylations and decarboxylation) to form the final <b>monomeric</b> <b>unit</b> (3). Two monomer units undergo oxidative coupling to form the atropisomeric axis (4). Oxidative cyclization occurs {{on one end of}} the molecule to form the ether ring (5). Finally, the hydroquinone on the same side of the previously mentioned ether oxidizes to form the quinone species, giving hibarimicinone.|$|E

Starting with 3 -bromophenylboronic acid and 1, 3 -diiodobenzene, the terphenyl bromide was synthesized. Lithiation of the dibromoterphenyl product, followed by formylation and Wittig olefination led to an advanced intermediate {{to be used in}} the final Grubbs Ring Closing Metathesis (RCM) reaction.

40|$|Polysaccharide {{analysis}} requires {{identification of}} <b>monomeric</b> <b>units,</b> sequence, linkage position and anomeric configuration. Conventional analysis is very tedious requiring release of <b>monomeric</b> <b>units</b> by chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis followed by derivatization to volatile species prior to gas chromatographic analysis. An alternative approach is thermal fragmentation {{which results in}} the formation of 1, 6 -anhydro-monosaccharides and 1, 6 -anhydro-oligosaccharides. The presence of the anhydro monomers relates information about the composition of monomeric isomers, the intact anhydro dimers provide information about linkage type and anomeric configuration. In this study, various neutral polysaccharides were analysed by off-line pyrolytic techniques, the pyrolysates were analysed by trimethylsilylation-gas chromatography and per-O-benzoylation high performance liquid chromatography.

In this way, the mean growth velocity as well as the thermodynamic entropy production and the sequence disorder can be calculated systematically. These different properties are also investigated in the regime of depolymerization where the macromolecular chain is dissolved by the surrounding solution. In this regime, the entropy production is shown to satisfy Landauer’s principle. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
