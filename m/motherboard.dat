5|$|Like the Fastra I, the Fastra II uses a Lian Li PC-P80 Armorsuit case, {{which has}} 10 {{expansion}} slots. The <b>motherboard</b> in the Fastra II {{was at that}} time the only workstation <b>motherboard</b> that had seven full-sized PCI Express x16 slots.|$|E
5|$|All seven PCI Express x16 {{slots in}} the Asus P6T7 <b>motherboard</b> {{were used in}} the {{building}} of the Fastra II computer. However, the video cards in the Fastra II are wide enough to require two such slots each. To solve this issue, the researchers came up with flexible PCI Express cables, and Tones developed a custom cage which allowed the video cards to suspend over the <b>motherboard.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike the +2A and +3, the Spectrum +2B and +3B do {{not share}} a common <b>motherboard.</b>|$|E
50|$|AMD {{confirmed}} that AM2 processors {{will work on}} AM2+ <b>motherboards</b> and AM2+ processors will work on AM2 <b>motherboards.</b> However, the operation of AM2+ processors on AM2 <b>motherboards</b> {{will be limited to}} the specifications of Socket AM2 (1 GHz HyperTransport 2.0, and one power plane for both cores and the IMC). AM2 processors do not benefit from the faster HyperTransport 3.0 and separate power planes on AM2+ <b>motherboards.</b> As with AM2 components, AM2+ CPUs and <b>motherboards</b> are designed to use DDR2 RAM exclusively.|$|R
5000|$|... microATX was {{explicitly}} {{designed to}} be backward-compatible with ATX. The mounting points of microATX <b>motherboards</b> are a subset of those used on full-size ATX boards, and the I/O panel is identical. Thus, microATX <b>motherboards</b> {{can be used in}} full-size ATX cases. Furthermore, most microATX <b>motherboards</b> generally use the same power connectors as ATX <b>motherboards,</b> thus permitting the use of full-size ATX power supplies with microATX boards.|$|R
50|$|Slotkets {{were first}} created {{to allow the}} use of Socket 8 Pentium Pro {{processors}} on Slot 1 <b>motherboards.</b> Later, they became more popular for inserting Socket 370 Intel Celerons into Slot 1 based <b>motherboards.</b> This lowered costs for computer builders, especially with dual processor machines. High-end <b>motherboards</b> accepting two Slot 1 processors (usually Pentium 2) were widely available, but double-socketed <b>motherboards</b> for the less expensive Socket 370 Celerons were not. The slotkets remained popular in the transition period from Slot to Socket-based Pentium III processors by allowing CPU upgrades in existing Slot 1 <b>motherboards.</b>|$|R
5|$|It {{also was}} the first {{computer}} to ship with a general-purpose DSP chip (Motorola 56001) on the <b>motherboard.</b> This was used to support sophisticated music and sound processing, including the Music Kit software.|$|E
5|$|On September 17, 1992, Apple {{recalled}} 60,000 PowerBook100s {{because of}} a potential safety problem. An electrical short, it was discovered, could melt a small hole in the casing, which occurred {{in three of the}} 60,000 notebooks manufactured between October 1991 and March 1992. On the day of the recall, Apple shares closed at $47, down $1.25, but some analysts discounted the recall's importance. In addition, the original power supplies had problems with insulation cracks that could cause a short in a fuse on the motherboard; and the computer was prone to cracks in the power adapter socket on the <b>motherboard,</b> which required a $400 replacement <b>motherboard</b> if the warranty had expired.|$|E
5|$|The +2B board (AMSTRAD {{part number}} Z70833) has no {{provision}} for floppy disk controller circuitry and the +3B <b>motherboard</b> (Amstrad part number Z70835) has {{no provision for}} connecting an internal tape drive.|$|E
50|$|Some desktop <b>motherboards</b> {{ship with}} Killer {{networking}} interfaces built-in, such as gaming <b>motherboards</b> from Gigabyte, MSI, and ASRock.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. version had Revision C, D, and E <b>motherboards.</b> While the U.K./European had Revision L {{and so on}} <b>motherboards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Late {{generation}} ZEOS <b>motherboards</b> {{models were}} code-named with a zoological theme. <b>Motherboards</b> based on early 486 designs went by classes of birds such as Duck, Goose, Gosling, and Martin. Later 486 and Pentium <b>motherboards</b> used families of serpents (i.e. snakes), such as Rattler, Python, Cobra, Coral, and Boa.|$|R
5|$|The Fastra II's predecessor, the Fastra I, has 4 dual-GPU GeForce 9800 GX2 video cards, for a {{total of}} 8 GPUs. At that time, the ASTRA group needed a <b>motherboard</b> that had four PCI Express x16 slots with double-spacing between each of them. The only such <b>motherboard</b> the ASTRA group could find at that time was the MSI K9A2 Platinum, which has four such slots. In 2009, the Asus P6T7 WS Supercomputer <b>motherboard,</b> which the Fastra II uses, was released, which has seven PCI Express x16 slots. The Fastra II has six faster dual-GPU GeForce GTX 295 video cards, and a single-GPU GeForce GTX 275, {{for a total}} of 13 GPUs. In the Fastra II, the GPUs mainly perform tomographic reconstruction. The {{technique}} which allows GPUs to perform general-purpose tasks like this outside of gaming, instead of CPUs, is called GPGPU, general-purpose computing on graphics processing units.|$|E
5|$|Fastra II {{relies on}} Nvidia's Scalable Link Interface (SLI) and is {{therefore}} limited {{to the number of}} GPUs supported by it and also by the vendor respectively the free and open-source device drivers. The Fastra II's <b>motherboard</b> is designed for workstations, and it is mainly being used in hospitals for medical imaging.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the number}} of GPUs in the system, its initial boot was unsuccessful. This was because its <b>motherboard</b> uses a 32 bit BIOS, which only had {{approximately}} 3 GB of address space for the video cards. However, Asus managed to provide them a specialized BIOS that entirely skipped the address space allocation of the GTX 295 video cards. The BIOS-replacement coreboot was not tested.|$|E
50|$|ASRock Z87- and H87-based <b>motherboards</b> support three {{displays}} simultaneously. Asus H87-based <b>motherboards</b> {{are also}} advertised to support three independent monitors at once.|$|R
5000|$|To address them, BIOS updates were {{released}} for some NVIDIA nForce 680i SLI based <b>motherboards</b> that eliminate those symptoms. Affected <b>motherboards</b> include: ...|$|R
50|$|On April 10, 2013, ECS {{unveiled}} Durathon, {{where all}} ECS <b>motherboards</b> are tested beyond industry standards for durability, stability, and reliability, {{as well as}} materials used {{in the manufacture of}} its <b>motherboards.</b> The name Durathon derives from the words durable and marathon, which refers to each <b>motherboard's</b> rigorous testing methods in extreme environmental conditions.|$|R
5|$|MRO's main {{computer}} is a 133MHz, 10.4million transistor, 32-bit, RAD750 processor. This processor is a radiation-hardened {{version of a}} PowerPC 750 or G3 processor with a specially built <b>motherboard.</b> The RAD750 is a successor to the RAD6000. This processor may seem underpowered in comparison to a modern PC processor, but it is extremely reliable, resilient, and can function in solar flare-ravaged deep space. The operating system software is VxWorks and has extensive fault protection protocols and monitoring.|$|E
5|$|PCs with a DVI {{interface}} {{are capable}} of video output to an HDMI-enabled monitor. Some PCs include an HDMI interface and may also be capable of HDMI audio output, depending on specific hardware. For example, Intel's <b>motherboard</b> chipsets since the 945G and NVIDIA’s GeForce 8200/8300 <b>motherboard</b> chipsets {{are capable of}} 8-channel LPCM output over HDMI. Eight-channel LPCM audio output over HDMI with a video card was first seen with the ATI Radeon HD 4850, which was released in June 2008 and is implemented by other video cards in the ATI Radeon HD 4000 series. Linux can drive 8-channel LPCM audio over HDMI if the video card has the necessary hardware and implements the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). The ATI Radeon HD 4000 series implements ALSA. Cyberlink announced in June 2008 that they would update their PowerDVD playback software to allow 192kHz/24-bit Blu-ray Disc audio decoding in Q3-Q4 of 2008. Corel's WinDVD 9 Plus currently has 96kHz/24-bit Blu-ray Disc audio decoding.|$|E
5|$|The device {{incorporates}} a 1.7GHz quad-core Snapdragon 600, an ARMv7 SoC, with 2GB of RAM. The chip provides support for LTE networks {{where they are}} available. Most HTC One models come with either 32 or 64 GB of internal, non-expandable storage—unlike the international model, the Chinese and Japanese models include a microSD slot and a removable back cover. Its internal components are arranged in a pyramid-like layout similar to the HTC Butterfly and HTC Windows Phone 8X with larger components (such as the screen and battery) positioned towards the front and smaller components (such as the <b>motherboard)</b> positioned towards the back. This internal layout also allows the device to have a curved backing.|$|E
50|$|In the DIY PC market, microATX <b>motherboards</b> {{in general}} are favored by cost-conscious buyers, where cost savings for the {{equivalent}} feature sets outweigh the added expandability of extra PCI/PCI Express slots provided by the full ATX versions. Since 2006, dual-GPU configurations became possible on microATX <b>motherboards</b> for high-end enthusiast gaming setups, further reducing the need for full ATX <b>motherboards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Socket AM3 {{processors}} {{are able}} to run on Socket AM2 and AM2+ <b>motherboards</b> with appropriate bios updates, but not vice versa. AM3 processors have a new memory controller supporting both DDR2 and DDR3 SDRAM, allowing backwards compatibility with AM2 and AM2+ <b>motherboards.</b> Since AM2 and AM2+ processors lack the new memory controller, they will not work on AM3 <b>motherboards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some <b>motherboards</b> {{can control}} the fan speed using {{software}} like SpeedFan, and most recent <b>motherboards</b> have built in Pulse-width modulation (PWM) fan control {{for one or two}} fans.|$|R
5|$|Valve added Steam Guard {{functionality}} to the Steam {{client in}} March 2011 {{to protect against}} the hijacking of accounts via phishing schemes, one of the largest support issues Valve had at the time. Steam Guard was advertised {{to take advantage of the}} identity protection provided by Intel's second-generation Core processors and compatible <b>motherboard</b> hardware, which allows users to lock their account to a specific computer. Once locked, activity by that account on other computers must first be approved by the user on the locked computer. Support APIs for Steam Guard are available to third-party developers through Steamworks. Steam Guard also offers two-factor, risk-based authentication that uses a one-time verification code sent to a verified email address associated with the Steam account; this was later expanded to include two-factor authentication through the Steam mobile application, known as Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator. If Steam Guard is enabled, the verification code is sent each time the account is used from an unknown machine.|$|E
25|$|Note, too, {{that some}} {{nominally}} bi-endian CPUs require <b>motherboard</b> help to fully switch endianness. For instance, the 32-bit desktop-oriented PowerPC processors in little-endian mode act as little-endian {{from the point}} of view of the executing programs, but they require the <b>motherboard</b> to perform a 64-bit swap across all 8 byte lanes to ensure that the little-endian view of things will apply to I/O devices. In the absence of this unusual <b>motherboard</b> hardware, device driver software must write to different addresses to undo the incomplete transformation and also must perform a normal byte swap.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft avoids {{outright}} announcements of new <b>motherboard</b> {{production runs}} and their subsequent {{appearance in the}} market {{in part due to}} uneven distribution causing buyer's remorse and to prevent purchaser delay. However, several major (and many minor) <b>motherboard</b> revisions are introduced in an attempt to build systems more cheaply (and thus increase profits), and as a happy side effect, to allow them to run cooler while consuming less power. Note that there is no clear divide between the appearance of <b>motherboard</b> revisions in retail. Due to individual stock production, distribution and rotation, it may become difficult to find specific versions.|$|E
50|$|Widely {{available}} Intel Matrix RAID / Intel Rapid Storage Technology, {{embedded in}} Intel server <b>motherboards</b> and modern desktop <b>motherboards,</b> is a pseudo-hardware controller, {{not a true}} hardware RAID controller.|$|R
5000|$|Shuttle has adapted {{several of}} its XPC models to {{alternately}} accept mini-ITX <b>motherboards.</b> The base of the XPC is provided with mounting points which accommodate both [...] "Shuttle form factor" [...] (ShFF) and mini-ITX <b>motherboards.</b> In order to accommodate mini-ITX <b>motherboards,</b> two of the ShFF mounting points are simply relocated (the other two mini-ITX mounting points are in common with ShFF mounting points).|$|R
50|$|Some <b>motherboards</b> have a {{built-in}} display to diagnose hardware problems. Most also report POST errors with audible beeps, if a PC speaker is attached. Such <b>motherboards</b> make POST cards less necessary.|$|R
25|$|Use <b>motherboard</b> {{video output}} - {{typically}} low 3D performance and low power.|$|E
25|$|Each slot {{has its own}} REQ# output to, and GNT# {{input from}} the <b>motherboard</b> arbiter.|$|E
25|$|Conroe, Conroe XE and Allendale all use Socket LGA 775; however, {{not every}} <b>motherboard</b> is {{compatible}} with these processors.|$|E
50|$|Although {{nearly all}} <b>motherboards</b> using this socket are {{intended}} for mobile products like laptops, a few desktop boards using this do exist. Supermicro, for example, produced a number of mini ITX <b>motherboards</b> using the QM77 chipset.|$|R
50|$|Mini-ITX <b>motherboards</b> with {{integrated}} AMD CPUs {{are also}} released. These <b>motherboards</b> often use mobile CPUs and feature passive cooling, and feature more powerful integrated graphics {{compared to their}} Intel counterparts, which makes them suitable for HTPC uses.|$|R
5000|$|Not all <b>motherboards</b> with {{multiple}} PCI-Express x16 slots support SLI. Recent <b>motherboards</b> as of August 2017 that support it are Intel's Z and X series chipsets (Z68, Z77, Z87, Z97, Z170, Z270, X79 and X99) and AMD's 990FX and X370 chipset. Earlier chipsets, {{such as the}} Intel X58, could support 2-way SLI over 16 lane PCI-e. In order for <b>motherboards</b> of that generation to support more than two GPUs {{they were required to}} implement Nvidia nForce chipsets.|$|R
