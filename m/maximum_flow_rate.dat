40|$|Abstract Background Mechanical {{stresses}} {{are known}} to play important roles in atherosclerotic plaque initiation, progression and rupture. It has been well-accepted that atherosclerosis initiation and early progression correlate negatively with flow wall shear stresses (FSS). However, mechanisms governing advanced plaque progression are not well understood. Method In vivo serial MRI data (patient follow-up) were acquired from 14 patients after informed consent. Each patient had 2 - 4 scans (scan interval: 18 months). Thirty-two scan pairs (baseline and follow-up scans) were formed with slices matched for model construction and analysis. Each scan pair had 4 - 10 matched slices which gave 400 - 1000 data points for analysis (100 points per slice on lumen). Point-wise plaque progression {{was defined as the}} wall thickness increase (WTI) at each data point. 3 D computational models with fluid-structure interactions were constructed based on in vivo serial MRI data to extract flow shear stress and plaque wall stress (PWS) on all data points to quantify correlations between plaque progression and mechanical stresses (FSS and PWS). FSS and PWS data corresponding to both <b>maximum</b> and minimum <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> in a cardiac cycle were used to investigate the impact of <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> on those correlations. Results Using follow-up scans and <b>maximum</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> 19 out of 32 scan pairs showed a significant positive correlation between WTI and FSS (positive/negative/no significance correlation ratio = 19 / 9 / 4), and 26 out of 32 scan pairs showed a significant negative correlation between WTI and PWS (correlation ratio = 2 / 26 / 4). Corresponding to minimum <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> the correlation ratio for WTI vs. FSS and WTI vs. PWS were (20 / 7 / 5) and (2 / 26 / 4), respectively. Using baseline scans, the correlation ratios for WTI vs. FSS were (10 / 12 / 10) and (9 / 13 / 10) for <b>maximum</b> and minimum <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> respectively. The correlation ratios for WTI vs. PWS were the same (18 / 5 / 9), corresponding to <b>maximum</b> and minimum <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> Conclusion <b>Flow</b> shear stress corresponding to the minimum <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> in a cardiac cycle had slightly better correlation with WTI, compared to FSS corresponding to <b>maximum</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> Choice of <b>maximum</b> or minimum <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> had no impact on PWS correlations. Advanced plaque progression correlated positively with flow shear stress and negatively with plaque wall stress using follow-up scans. Correlation results using FSS at the baseline scan were inconclusive. </p...|$|R

Measurements of <b>maximum</b> <b>flow</b> at constant lung inflation (i. e. liters thoracic gas volume) showed larger changes, both after constriction and after dilation, than measurements of peak expiratory <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> 1 sec {{forced expiratory volume}} and {{the slope of the}} effort-independent portion of MEFV curves.

The decreased <b>maximum</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> after constrictor agents are not caused by changes in lung static recoil force and are attributed to narrowing of small airways, i. e., airways which are uncompressed during forced expirations.
