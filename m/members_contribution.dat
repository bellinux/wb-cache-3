All four women live religious backgrounds with Curti being Christ from Switzerland, Shak-Dagsay, a Buddhist originally from Tibet, Turner, a Buddhist-Baptist, how she calls herself, from Nutbush, Tennessee and Shende-Sathaye, of Hinduism background. While the second album adds a children choir, the third album had been added with classical Hindu music and mantras due to the addition of the fourth member Shende-Sathaye in back in 2014.

40|$|The paper {{compares the}} contribution, power and {{influence}} of non-executive directors and part-time chairpersons within large UK PLC's, using interview data collected for a pilot study. Two questions are addressed: What contribution, if any, is made by non-executive directors and part-time chairmen? How, if at all, do part-time chairpersons exercise {{power and influence}}? The paper reveals that part-time chairmen and non-executive directors claim {{to contribute to a}} broad range of issues, ranging from the strategy of the firm, to the appointment, selection and dismissal of board <b>members.</b> <b>Contribution</b> is made by part-time chairmen and non-executive directors converting power sources into influence. A variety of influence methods are used by part-time chairmen and non-executive directors to contribute as board members. Part-time chairmen influence most by assertiveness, using the authority that comes with leading the board. Non-executive directors influence most through persuasion and coalition formation. Non-executive directors less on their positional authority to exert influence, and more on their personal knowledge, experience and expertise, as well as their ability to form relationships with individuals both inside and outside of the boardroom...|$|E
40|$|For {{the past}} two decades, legal and {{economic}} scholarship has tended {{to assume that the}} central economic problem addressed by corporation law is getting managers and directors to act as faithful agents for shareholders. There are other important economic problems faced by business firms, however. This article introduces a Symposium that explores one of those alternate economic problems: the problem of "team production". Team production problems can arise whenever three conditions are met: (1) economic production requires the combined inputs of two or more individuals; (2) at least some of these inputs are "team-specific," meaning they have a significantly higher value when used in the team than in their next best use; and (3) the gains resulting from team production are nonseparable, making it difficult to attribute any particular portion to any single team <b>member?s</b> <b>contribution.</b> In such situations, it can be difficult or impossible for team members to draft explicit contracts that protect their team-specific investments from other team members? opportunism. Thus the nine articles in the Symposium explore the implications of team production analysis {{for a wide variety of}} business organizations, including public corporations, private companies, multinational firms, and venture capital firms...|$|E

40|$|In {{the frame}} of {{decentralization}} reforms in Namibia, local water point associations evolved that have to collect water fees from community members to cover maintenance costs. Enforcement, however, is weak and water point associations {{have to rely on}} moral pleas. As a consequence, several users refuse to pay. I test the impact of informal sanction mechanisms on cooperation among water point users in groups with equal and unequal incomes. Interestingly, and in contrast to the vast majority of related studies, cooperation does not increase under the threat of punishment, though the punishment option was frequently used. At individual level I show that while punishments do not affect cooperative behaviour, they provoke counter-punishment. This suggests that peer-sanctioning mechanisms as a means to enforce norm-compliance are not accepted among water point association <b>members.</b> <b>Contribution</b> levels were higher in heterogeneous groups compared with homogenous ones, and both pro-social and anti-social punishments occurred more frequently in homogenous groups. A comparison between different income types further reveals that the poor contribute larger shares of their income than those endowed with higher incomes and that they use punishment as frequently and as vehemently as the better-off, despite higher opportunity costs.

40|$|Background : Rural out-migration is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in Ethiopia. Several studies explain migration as the outcome of an individual utility-maximizing decision. This perspective ignores the diversity of migration types and inadequately explains migration in the wider context of mutual and interdependent risk-sharing strategies of household members in response to locational advantages and disadvantages. Objective : The main objective {{of this study is}} to examine households' choice of short-term and long-term migration and its underlying determinants in different locational contexts. Methods : Based on the household-centred New Economics Labour Migration (NELM) framework, we conducted quasi-longitudinal and context-specific structured interviews with 553 randomly selected households in four rural study sites in north-west Ethiopia. The determinants of household migration decisions on the one hand and the variables explaining decisions for short-term and long-term migration were analysed in a binary logistic regression and a multinomial logistic regression. Results : The results show a positive relation between migration decisions and household variables such as a higher education status, perceived food insufficiency, female household heads, household-head age, household size, and number of economic activities. Beyond the NELM framework, location in different livelihood zones is also significant in diverging migration strategies. Short-term migration is very much driven by locational advantages and food insufficiency. The propensity for long-term migration significantly increases for households with a higher educational level, but declines with a rising number of dependent household <b>members.</b> <b>Contribution</b> : We contribute to the discussion of ambiguous determinants of migration and provide more differentiated insight into short-term and long-term migration decisions. Besides strong support for the NELM framework, we highlight the relevance of education for long-term migration and locational meso-level factors for short-term migration...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{empirical}} {{analysis of the}} relationship between income sharing rules and physician heterogeneity in medical group practices. The economies to group formation associated with risk-sharing, mutual monitoring,and internal referral are served by sharing at least a portion of group income equally. Sharing group income equally is problematic, however, when group members differ in their contribution to group income. <b>Member</b> <b>contributions</b> to group income may differ because of differences in ability, effort, or the price of services across specialty fields. The analysis below is addressed {{to the question of how}} income sharing rules in physician groups are affected by variation in <b>member</b> <b>contributions.</b> The analysis finds evidence that heterogeneity in <b>member</b> <b>contributions</b> to group income limits the use of equal income sharing rules in multispecialty groups relative to single specialty groups, and large groups relative to small groups. Nevertheless, 65 % of all groups in the survey share at least a pn of group income equally, which broadly suggests that the joint surplus enhancement from risk sharing, mutual monitoring, and internal referral are sufficient to overcome the incentive problems of such rulesHeterogeneity; Medical groups; Sharing rules, JEL classifications: D 21, 119, L 22,...|$|R
