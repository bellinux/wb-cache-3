Before the war a bill was passed, on the motion of Dracontides, according to which Pericles should deposit his accounts of public moneys with the prytanes and the jurors should decide upon his case with ballots which had lain upon the altar of the goddess on the acropolis. This clause of the bill was however amended with the motion that the case be tried before fifteen hundred jurors in the ordinary way, whether one wanted to call it a prosecution for embezzlement and bribery, or <b>malversation.</b>|$|E

Immediately after the 2009 local elections and Milan Bandić's landslide victory in Zagreb as a candidate of the Social Democrats, there was much talk of his potential candidacy for president. Before the election, many influential members of SDP urged Zoran Milanović, the president of the party, to intervene and nominate someone other than Bandić, referring to numerous corruption and <b>malversation</b> allegations made against him during his tenure as the mayor of Zagreb. However, Milanović denied the widespread rumours about internal turmoil and publicly supported Milan Bandić in the mayoral campaign, making him the target of an open letter signed by many prominent left-wing intellectuals, in which they attacked Bandić and endorsed Josip Kregar. Although Milanović dismissed these charges, SDP conspicuously put Bandić {{at the bottom of the}} electoral list for the city council, which prompted further accusations of hypocrisy from their opponents.|$|E

In December 1860, on ascertaining that Floyd had honored heavy drafts made by government contractors in anticipation of their earnings, the president requested his resignation. Several days later Floyd was indicted for <b>malversation</b> in office, although the indictment was overruled in 1861 on technical grounds. There is no proof that he profited by these irregular transactions; in fact, he went out of the office financially embarrassed.|$|E

60|$|Tenderness {{for these}} truly idle devices for keeping {{power in the}} hands of a {{restricted}} class was all the less to be expected in Mr. Greg, as he had made a serious study of French politics prior to 1848. Now the Monarchy of July maintained a narrow and exclusive franchise, and its greatest minister was the very type of the class from whom Mr. Greg would have sought the directors of national affairs. If ever there was a statesman who approached the fulfilment of Mr. Greg's conditions, it was Guizot. Guizot had undergone years of patient historic study; nobody of his time had reflected more carefully on the causes and forces of great movements; he had more of what is called the calm philosophic mind, than any one then eminent in literature; he overflowed with what Mr. Greg describes as the highest kind of wisdom; his moral pretensions were austere, lofty, and unbending to a fault. No man of any time would seem to have been better entitled to a place among the Wise and the Good whom nations ought to seek out to rule over them. Yet this great man was one of the very worst statesmen that ever governed France. The severe morality of the student was cast behind him by the minister. He did not even shrink from defending, from considerations of political convenience, the <b>malversations</b> of a colleague. The pattern of wisdom and goodness devised and executed a cynical and vile intrigue, from which Sir Robert Walpole would have shrunk with masculine disgust, and that would have raised scruples in Dubois or Calonne. Finally, this famous professor of political science possessed so little skill in political practice, that a few years of his policy wrecked a constitution and brought a dynasty to the ground.|$|R
60|$|The {{result of}} the Parliamentary {{inquiries}} has been, that the East India Company was found totally corrupted, and totally perverted from the purposes of its institution, whether political or commercial; that the powers {{of war and peace}} given by the charter had been abused, by kindling hostilities in every quarter for the purposes of rapine; that almost all the treaties of peace they have made have only given cause to so many breaches of public faith; that countries once the most flourishing are reduced to a state of indigence, decay, and depopulation, to the diminution of our strength, and to the infinite dishonor of our national character; that the laws of this kingdom are notoriously, and almost in every instance, despised; that the servants of the Company, by the purchase of qualifications to vote in the General Court, and, at length, by getting the Company itself deeply in their debt, have obtained the entire and absolute mastery in the body by which they ought to have been ruled and coerced. Thus their <b>malversations</b> in office are supported, instead of being checked by the Company. The whole of the affairs of that body are reduced to a most perilous situation; and many millions of innocent and deserving men, who are under the protection of this nation, and who ought to be protected by it, are oppressed by a most despotic and rapacious tyranny. The Company and their servants, having strengthened themselves by this confederacy, set at defiance the authority and admonitions of this House employed to reform them; and when this House had selected certain principal delinquents, whom they declared it the duty of the Company to recall, the Company held out its legal privileges against all reformation, positively refused to recall them, and supported those who had fallen under the just censure of this House with new and stronger marks of countenance and approbation.|$|R

Why, to Parliament, to be sure,--to Parliament, from whom their trust was derived,--to Parliament, which alone is capable of comprehending the magnitude of its object, and its abuse, and alone capable of an effectual legislative remedy. The very charter, which is held out to exclude Parliament from correcting <b>malversation</b> {{with regard to the}} high trust vested in the Company, is the very thing which at once gives a title and imposes a duty on us to interfere with effect, wherever power and authority originating from ourselves are perverted from their purposes, and become instruments of wrong and violence.|$|E

5000|$|În his {{capacity}} of {{director of the}} press, Eugen Filotti had the responsibility of verifying the activity of foreign press correspondents working in Romania. Besides many journalists, adhering to high professional standards, there were some less honest persons who tried to squeeze in. The case of Julius Köver exemplifies the problems raised by incorrect reporting. Köver claimed to be an economic correspondent of the Austrian daily Neue Freie Presse, presenting the required credentials. In 1933 he also registered at the Direction of the Press in Bucharest as correspondent of the American United Press International. Köver {{also contributed to the}} newspapers [...] "Pester Lloyd" [...] şi [...] "Budapesti Hírlap" [...] published in Hungary and the German language newspapers Prager Tagblatt and Die Wirtschaft published in Czechoslovakia. Julius Köver's activities started raising suspicions in February 1935, when United Press released the information that Prince Nicholas of Romania was expected to return to Romania, where the Iron Guard was preparing a revolt intending to depose King Carol II and to replace him with Nicholas. Another false news sent by Julius Köver to America claimed that Nicolae Titulescu, the minister of Foreign Affairs, had signed an agreement in Moscow, which granted the Soviet army the right of transit through Romania. Such information had not only the result of casting a negative image of the country but of also weakening Romania's position within the Balkan Pact. Called by Eugen Filotti to the Direction of the Press for explanations, Julius Köver claimed that the news releases of the United Press Agency had been generated in Vienna and that {{he had nothing to do}} with them. Actually Köver had designed an ingenious system to transmit his fallacies to various branch offices of the agency, from where they were retransmitted to the United States. He hoped that this stratagem would help him hide his identity from the Romanian authorities and, at the same time, would enable him claim that he used it to elude the censorship existing in Romania. Eugen Filotti was able to point these <b>malversations</b> and, at last, Julius Köver was expelled from Romania.|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring {{the first}} decades of the 20 th century, shortly after the 1905 passing of the law {{separating}} church and state, the ACIP was called upon to take over the administration and financial organization of the large Paris Jewish community. About 48, 000 of France’s 80, 000 Jews lived in Paris or its suburbs at the turn of the century. Repeated fraudulent procedures in ritual slaughter discovered by the butchery control board deeply shocked clients seeking to observe kashrut. Moreover, owners of (Jewish) butcher shops and delicatessens who evaded the monthly tax imposed on their trade but which most of their counterparts paid, harmed the financial interests of the Jewish community for whom the butchery tax was an important source of revenue. Relations between Jewish religious authorities and (Jewish) butchers and delicatessen owners, but also their clients deteriorated as a result of wariness and suspicions about the true nature of how truly kosher were available meat products. The fines imposed by the Consistory to halt fraudulent practices showed little efficiency. Moreover, the pressure levelled by the Russian-Polish (Jewish) immigrant community about how shehita was practiced, and also their denunciation of the lax observance of shabbat by food merchants, but also the competition in the field of animal slaughter prompted the Consistory in overhauling the כשר butchery service towards greater respect for conformity with ritual rules. These changes were accompanied by an increase in community taxes on kosher products. But fraud and sanctions alternated without offering a real solution. The Consistory then modified its strategy. The state law of August 1, 1905 on the repression of fraud in the sale of merchandises and falsification of foodstuffs referred to offenses or attempted offences about the nature and quality of merchandises, as well as to their kind and origin could very well apply to the frauds committed by certain of the participants in the ritual slaughter circuit. ACIP then initiated judicial action against those guilty of such frauds, a procedure which only finally produced concrete results in the early 1930 s. * The Israelite Consistory of Paris (ACIP) is the Paris branch of the Consistoire Central Israelite de France (Central Israelite Consistory of France), the board of senior Jewish figures created by then-Emperor Napoleon 1 in December 1808, and which, then as today, administers Jewish religious affairs in France. Durant les premières décennies du XXe siècle, au lendemain même de la loi de Séparation, l’ACIP est appelée à prendre en main la gestion et l’organisation financière de l’importante communauté parisienne. En effet, quelque 48 000 des 80 000 Juifs de France résident au tournant du siècle à Paris ou dans sa banlieue. Les fraudes répétées, relevées par le service du contrôle des boucheries dans la mise en œuvre de l’abattage rituel dans la capitale, abusent gravement de la clientèle attachée à l’observance des prescriptions alimentaires. En outre, les commerçants bouchers et charcutiers, en se soustrayant à la redevance mensuelle que la plupart de leurs confrères acquittent, lèsent dans le même temps, les intérêts financiers de la communauté dont la taxe sur la boucherie constitue un élément appréciable dans les recettes. Les relations entre l’institution cultuelle, les bouchers et charcutiers mais également la clientèle se sont détériorées par la méfiance et le soupçon qui ne cessent de peser sur la qualité rituelle des produits carnés. Les amendes infligées par le consistoire pour faire cesser ces pratiques frauduleuses vont s’avérer de peu d’efficacité. En outre, la pression exercée par la communauté immigrée russo-polonaise sur la mise en œuvre de la chehita, sa dénonciation de la profanation du chabbat par les commerçants de bouche, mais aussi la concurrence exercée en matière d’abattage incitent le Consistoire à entreprendre une vaste restauration du service de la boucherie כשר dans le sens d’une plus grande conformité rituelle. Ces changements s’accompagnent d’une augmentation de la redevance. <b>Malversations</b> et sanctions alternent sans vraiment offrir de solution. L’institution religieuse va alors modifier sa stratégie : la loi du 1 er août 1905 sur la répression des fraudes dans la vente des marchandises et des falsifications des denrées alimentaires, qui font référence aux délits de tromperie ou de tentative de tromperie sur la nature, la qualité substantielle des marchandises, sur leur espèce ou sur leur origine faussement attribuée, peut parfaitement s’appliquer aux <b>malversations</b> commises par certains des acteurs du circuit de l’abattage rituel. L’ACIP entreprend alors d’intenter une action judiciaire contre les auteurs de ces tromperies, une procédure qui n’allait être réalisée qu’au début des années trente...|$|R

I mentioned above in particular the enviable consciousness of our little red-headed kinsman Gus Barker, who, as by a sharp prevision, snatched what gaiety he might from a life to be cut short, in a cavalry dash, by one of the Confederate bullets of 1863: he blew out at us, on New York Sundays, as I have said, sharp puffs of the atmosphere of the Institution Charlier--strong to us, that is, the atmosphere of whose institutions was weak; but it was above all during a gregarious visit paid him in a livelier field still that I knew myself merely mother'd and brother'd. It had been his fate to be but scantly the latter and never at all the former--our aunt Janet had not survived his birth; but on this day of our collective pilgrimage to Sing-Sing, where he was at a [...] "military" [...] school and clad in a fashion that represented to me the very panoply of war, he shone with a rare radiance of privation. Ingenuous and responsive, of a social disposition, a candour of gaiety, that matched his physical activity--the most beautifully made athletic little person, and in the highest degree appealing and engaging--he not only did us the honours of his dazzling academy (dazzling at least to me) but had all the air of showing us over the great State prison which even then flourished near at hand and to which he accompanied us; a party of a composition that comes back to me as wonderful, the New York and Albany cousinships appearing to have converged and met, for the happy occasion, with the generations and sexes melting together and moving in a loose harmonious band. The party must have been less numerous than by the romantic tradition or confused notation of my youth, and what I mainly remember of it beyond my sense of our being at once an attendant train to my aged and gentle and in general most unadventurous grandmother, and a chorus of curiosity and amusement roundabout the vivid Gussy, is our collective impression that State prisons were on the whole delightful places, vast, bright and breezy, with a gay, free circulation in corridors and on stairs, a pleasant prevalence of hot soup and fresh crusty rolls, in tins, of which visitors admiringly partook, and for the latter, in chance corners and on sunny landings, much interesting light brush of gentlemen remarkable but for gentlemanly crimes--that is defalcations and <b>malversations</b> to striking and impressive amounts.|$|R
