40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Chicken</b> <b>meat</b> in two {{different}} forms (<b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> and <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> powder) were added into white flour and whole wheat blend baguette bread formulations for protein enrichment and finally developing new and healthy snacks. The <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> and powder levels were 10 % for white flour baguette, and 15 % for whole wheat blend. The dried baguette samples were packaged under 100 % N 2, and physical, chemical, microbiological and sensorial properties were evaluated during 3 months of storage. Protein content of <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> powder added samples were found statistically higher than <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> added samples. Hardness of the snacks was significantly affected from type of <b>chicken</b> <b>meat,</b> such as values were higher for <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> added samples than <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> powder added samples. Lipid oxidation of the snacks was determined by TBA analysis, and TBA value for whole wheat mixture snack with 15 % of <b>chicken</b> <b>meat</b> was the highest among all during storage. The highest overall acceptance score was obtained from white flour snack with 10 % <b>chicken</b> <b>meat.</b> There was no coliform bacteria detected during storage {{and the results of}} yeast-mold count and aerobic plate count of snacks remained between the quantitative ranges...|$|R

25|$|In chickens, {{a limited}} number of studies have {{investigated}} the specific effect of diet on the fatty acid composition of preen oil in <b>meat</b> <b>chickens.</b> The preen oil of <b>meat</b> <b>chickens</b> is dominated by saturated fatty acids, which make up to 97% of the total fatty acids, with 13 different medium to long chain saturated fatty acids (C8:0 to C22:0) detected.

Mixed paella is a free-style combination of meat from land animals, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes beans.
