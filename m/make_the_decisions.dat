25|$|In series 10, {{the format}} to Bootcamp was changed: the judges find out their {{categories}} before Bootcamp starts, and each judge will {{make decisions on}} who is performing in the Six-Chair Challenge by eliminating the contestants, this is up to each individual judge. From Series 11 onwards, the judges do not know their categories before the Bootcamp, {{so they have to}} <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> together. After the Bootcamp round, the mentor challenges their contestants through the Six-Chair Challenge. Judges make decisions on who to put through to judges' houses straight after each act has performed, with those getting a yes taking a chair in the final six chairs on stage. It is up to the mentor to decide, which act they want to take to judges' houses, but once all six spots are full, if the mentor wants to send another act through to the next stage it means they have to replace one of those who were previously given a yes. This format was very poorly rated by many members of the British public. Bootcamp still took place, but only highlights were shown in the first episode of the Six-chair challenge. In series 12, all of Bootcamp aired on-screen. A more brutal twist to the Six-Chair Challenge was introduced in series 14, where the mentor is to sit at a smaller table {{at the side of the}} arena while making the decisions, while the other judges remain at a larger table on the other side.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to his predecessor, who was actively involved in most elements of his government, Getty preferred to set the government's broad direction and leave lower-level details to his ministers. [...] Ralph Klein, while serving as Environment Minister under Getty, commented that [...] "If you are a minister, you run that portfolio yourself" [...] and expressed {{an appreciation for the}} freedom that the Premier gave his cabinet.

500|$|Pauline's {{marriage}} to the luckless Arthur is central to her character, remaining one of her defining traits even {{after his death in}} 1996. The dynamics of the relationship were clear {{from the beginning of the}} programme, with Pauline depicted as the matriarchal force that holds the Fowler family together, while Arthur is depicted as weak, emotionally unstable and easily dominated by the stronger females of his family. Writer Jacquetta May, who once played Rachel Kominski in the programme, has commented that [...] " [...] represented the matriarchal relationship of strong woman/weak man... Arthur, only sporadically employed and disabled by a breakdown, often behaved like a little boy, while Pauline had to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> and keep the family functioning in the face of poverty and unemployment, teenage pregnancy and depression." ...|$|E

So, after mutual agreements on storyline and character, Mank went off with Houseman and did his version, while I stayed in Hollywood and wrote mine." [...] Taking these drafts, Welles drastically condensed and rearranged them, then added scenes of his own.

[...] Nintendo's console debuted against an established competitor, while NEC's TurboGrafx-16 failed to gain traction, and NEC soon pulled out of the market. [...] In large part due to the popularity of Sonic the Hedgehog, the Sega Genesis outsold the SNES in the United States nearly two to one during the 1991 holiday season. This success led to Sega having control of 65% of the 16-bit console market in January 1992, making it the first time Nintendo was not the console leader since December 1985.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Breyer envisioned three {{possible}} {{responses to the}} majority's decision. First, legislatures could prescribe exactly the same sentence for all possible variations of a crime [...] an automatic five-year sentence for all robberies, for instance.

[...] Prosecutors would {{end up with the}} real control over defendants' sentences, since prosecutors ultimately <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> regarding how to charge the case. Second, states could return to indeterminate sentencing, in which the authorized range of punishment for crimes is very broad.
