40|$|International audienceClient-based {{attacks on}} {{internet}} users with malicious web pages represent {{a serious and}} rising threat. Internet Browsers with enabled active content technologies such as JavaScript are vulnerable to so-called drive-by downloads. Drive-by downloads are able to automatically infect a victim's system during a single visit of a crafted web page testing various vulnerabilities and installing e. g. malware files or illegal content without user interaction. In this paper we present <b>MonkeyWrench,</b> a low-interaction web-honeyclient allowing automatic identification of malicious web pages by performing static analysis of the HTML-objects in a web page as well as dynamic analysis of scripts by execution in an emulated browser environment. Using this hybrid approach <b>MonkeyWrench</b> overcomes shortcomings of existing low-interaction web-honeyclients in dealing with obfuscated JavaScript while outperforming high-interaction systems. Further <b>MonkeyWrench</b> is {{able to identify the}} exact vulnerability triggered by a malicious page and to extract payloads from within obfuscated scripts which are valuable information to security analysts and researchers. Results of an examination of several hundred thousand web pages demonstrate <b>MonkeyWrench's</b> ability to expose rising threats of the web, and to collect malware and JavaScript exploit samples...|$|R

40|$|This work {{examines}} acts of <b>monkeywrenching,</b> {{like the}} Oct. 19, 1998 arson at Vail, as punitive acts. The {{purpose of this}} effort is {{to see if the}} application of a broad, sociological definition of punishment to acts of this type can reveal hidden or infrequently discussed aspects of punish-ment as a social mechanism, as well as <b>monkeywrenching</b> as a social act. Following a brief introduction, definitions for punishment (emphasizing its understanding as a social mechanism), and extra-legal alternatives to environmental protection (an ad hoc category created to house acts of <b>monkeywrenching)</b> are provided. The paper then looks at acts of mon-keywrenching with reference to three concepts that are central to punish-ment: 1) the pain of punishment; 2) the rule-bound nature of punishment; 3) the authority to punish. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the problems associated with monkeywrenching’s use as a punitive alter-native to environmental protection...|$|R
