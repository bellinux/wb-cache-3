Chicago had won {{three of the}} prior four matches, including a 15–6 victory over Michigan in 1900. Coach Yost noted, [...] "I knew long before I came to Michigan of the great rivalry existing between this University and the University of Chicago.

500|$|In 1874, Carte leased the Opera Comique, a small theatre off the Strand, {{where he}} {{presented}} a Brussels {{company in the}} British premiere of the operetta Giroflé-Giroflà by Charles Lecocq, followed by The Broken Branch, an English adaptation of Gaston Serpette's La branche cassée. Carte announced his ambitions {{on the front of}} the programme for the latter: [...] "It is <b>my</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> establish in London a permanent abode for light Opera." [...] The Observer reported, [...] "Mr D'Oyly Carte is not only a skilful manager, but a trained musician, and he appears to have grasped the fact that the public are beginning to become weary of what is known as a genuine opera bouffe, and are ready to welcome a musical entertainment of a higher order, such as a musician might produce with satisfaction".|$|E
500|$|The International Olympic Committee {{recognises}} {{the fastest}} performances in pool-based swimming {{events at the}} Olympic Games. Men's swimming {{has been part of}} the Summer Olympics since the Games' modern inception in 1896; it was not until 1912 that women competed against each other. The swimming events at the 1896 Olympic Games were held in a bay in the Aegean Sea with swimmers being required to swim to the shore—Hungarian swimmer Alfréd Hajós won two gold medals that year, saying [...] "My will to live completely overcame <b>my</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> win." [...] The 1900 Games in Paris saw the swimming events take place in the River Seine while the events at the 1908 Summer Olympics were hosted in a 100-metre pool located within an athletics track in the White City Stadium in London.|$|E
500|$|By 1874, Richard D'Oyly Carte, a {{musician}} and ambitious young impresario, had begun producing operettas in London. [...] He announced his ambitions {{on the front}} of the programme for one of his productions that year: [...] "It is <b>my</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> establish in London a permanent abode for light opera." [...] The Observer reported, [...] "Mr D'Oyly Carte is not only a skilful manager, but a trained musician, and he appears to have grasped the fact that the public are beginning to become weary of what is known as a genuine opera bouffe, and are ready to welcome a musical entertainment of a higher order, such as {{a musician}} might produce with satisfaction". [...] He wanted to establish a body of tasteful English comic opera that would appeal to families, in contrast to the [...] burlesques and adaptations of French operettas and opera bouffes that dominated the London musical stage at that time.|$|E

500|$|Mendes {{returned}} to Portugal {{ahead of the}} 2001–02 season, joining Primeira Liga club União Leiria on a season-long loan. Reflecting on his time in France, he said [...] "I never hid <b>my</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> return to Portugal, but now I can not say anything more." [...] He made his debut on 11 August 2001 in a 0–0 draw at Braga. Mendes played regularly under the management of José Mourinho prior to his departure to Porto, but fell out of favour under his replacement, Vítor Pontes. He made 16 league appearances for Leiria, helping the club finish 7th in the Primeira Liga, before returning to Strasbourg. Upon his departure, Mendes was critical of the club's president João Bartolomeu, who he believed created instability at the club. [...] "The Union of Leiria is a complicated club at senior management level, especially the president, who sees things where they do not exist and it creates instability in the squad," [...] said Mendes who [...] "leaves great friends in Leiria".|$|E
500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Martin's {{brilliance}} in evoking atmosphere through {{description is}} an enduring hallmark of his fiction, the settings {{much more than}} just props on a painted stage", and the novels captivate readers with [...] "complex storylines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing, and the willingness to kill off even his major characters". CNN remarked that [...] "the story weaves through differing points of view in a skillful mix of observation, narration and well-crafted dialogue that illuminates both character and plot with fascinating style", and David Orr of The New York Times found that [...] "All of his hundreds of characters have grace notes of history and personality that advance a plot line. Every town has an elaborately recalled series of triumphs and troubles." [...] Salon.com's Andrew Leonard [...] "couldn't stop reading Martin because <b>my</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> know {{what was going to happen}} combined with my absolute inability to guess what would happen and left me helpless before his sorcery. At the end, I felt shaken and exhausted."

500|$|... "Suede and America fuelled <b>my</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> {{prove to}} {{everyone}} that Blur were worth it", Albarn told Mojo in 2000, [...] "There {{was nothing more}} important in my life." [...] Albarn felt the popularity American grunge music was enjoying in Britain at the time would soon run out of steam, and argued that Blur would embody a renaissance of classic British pop on their next album. Although the singer felt Blur had finally found their musical identity, not everybody was convinced with Albarn's new British-centric manifesto. Food Records owner David Balfe, in particular, strongly disagreed, and got into fierce arguments with Albarn over the proposed change in Blur's image. After the still-sceptical Balfe finally relented, Food warily gave Blur the go-ahead {{to work on their}} second album with Albarn's first choice of producer, Andy Partridge of XTC. Blur and Partridge began work at The Church, a studio in Crouch End owned by keyboardist Dave Stewart. However, the pairing didn't work out. Bassist Alex James described the sessions as a [...] "disaster"; he added that [...] "as it was all being put together, they were all good parts, but it just wasn't ... sexy". Partridge said in 1999 of the sessions: [...] "I felt quite fatherly and I thought I did sterling work. They got Dave ‘Twat’ Balfe really stoned to listen to some mixes and he was rolling around going, ‘This is fantastic, you're George Martin and they're The Beatles.’ Next day he'd say, ‘Quite frankly, Andy, this is shit.’" [...] The band successfully recorded four songs, but they were wary about working in the same conditions again.|$|E

500|$|In 1813 the United States was at {{war with}} Great Britain, and Baltimore was {{preparing}} for an eventual attack as the fleet of the British Royal Navy had complete maritime control of the Chesapeake Bay. [...] Major George Armistead, the U.S. Army commander of the Infantry and Artillery units that defended Fort McHenry in Baltimore, felt that the fort was prepared for an attack, except it lacked a flag. [...] In {{a letter to the}} head of the Maryland Militia and military commander for Baltimore, Major General Samuel Smith, he wrote, [...] "We, sir, are ready at Fort McHenry to defend Baltimore against invading by the enemy. [...] That is to say, we are ready except that we have no suitable ensign to display over the Star Fort and it is <b>my</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> have a flag so large that the British will have no difficulty seeing it from a distance." [...] A delegation consisting of Armistead, Smith, Brig. General John Stricker, and Commodore Joshua Barney, Pickersgill's brother-in-law, visited with Pickersgill, and discussed the particulars of the desired flag. [...] They commissioned Pickersgill to make two flags, [...] "one American ensign, 30 X 42 feet, first quality bunting" [...] and another flag 17 by 25 feet." [...] A task as large as the making of these flags was beyond the capability of one person to complete, and Pickersgill not only drew on members of her own household for help, but also contracted labor from the immediate neighborhood. In early summer 1813, she began the job with the assistance of her daughter, Caroline, her two nieces, Eliza Young and Margaret Young, a free African American apprentice, Grace Wisher, and likely her elderly mother, Rebecca Young. [...] An additional unnamed African American who boarded in the house is also listed as helping in some sources, as were additional local seamstresses who were hired during the summer. Often working late into the evening, until midnight at times, Pickersgill's team was able to complete the job in six weeks. [...] Pickersgill's daughter, in an 1876 letter to Georgiana Armistead Appleton, the daughter of Major Armistead (later breveted a lieutenant colonel), wrote these particulars about the flag: ...|$|E

The day will not go to its place like any other, for this entire day stands within my domain..." [...] Daylight was miraculously extended until Rabbi Shimon had completed his final teaching and died. This symbolized that all light is subservient to spiritual light, and particularly to the primeval light contained within the mystical teachings of the Torah. As such, the custom of lighting fires symbolizes this revelation of powerful light.|$|E

2500|$|He was {{appointed}} {{editor of the}} Evening Standard in March 1991 and replaced (the by then) [...] Sir David English the following year {{as editor of the}} Daily Mail, after turning down an offer from Rupert Murdoch to edit The Times. Dacre believed that Murdoch [...] "would not accept <b>my</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> edit with freedom". It was his approach to the job of editor—"hard-working, disciplined, confrontational"—which had led Murdoch to attempt to hire him. For the Mail, Dacre was considered important enough for English to become editor-in-chief, considered a means of sidelining someone considered unsackable. After English's death in March 1998, Dacre himself became the Mail Group's editor-in-chief the following July, in addition to remaining as editor of the Daily Mail.|$|E
