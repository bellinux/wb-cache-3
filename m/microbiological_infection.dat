40|$|Background/PurposeAtherosclerosis {{plays an}} {{important}} role in stroke. A <b>microbiological</b> <b>infection</b> has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, in particular the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). The objective of this study was to determine the association between HCMV infection and atherosclerosis of the internal carotid arteries in patients of Chinese Han ethnicity with ischemic stroke. MethodsHCMV DNA and antigen were detected in atherosclerotic internal carotid arteries from 35 patients with ischemic stroke and 20 controls from a Chinese Han ethnic population. Immunohisto-chemistry, in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the HCMV immediate early (IE) and late (L) antigen as well as DNA in the vascular walls. ResultsWe observed that the proportion of cases that tested positive for HCMV IE but not L antigen and DNA was statistically greater in stroke patients compared with the control population. ConclusionHCMV IE antigen and DNA were associated with the pathological process of atherosclerosis. The vessel wall might be the infection site of the dormant virus...|$|E
40|$|Research {{into the}} effects of cold-storage and {{shelf-life}} on the hybrid mandarin «Murcott» showed the best results with storage at 6 °C or 6 °C for 6 days and 14 °C for 1 day. Longer or lower temperature cycles: 6 °C for 18 days and 14 °C for 7 days; 2 °C for 18 days and 14 °C for 7 days; 2 °C for 6 days and 14 °C for 1 day, caused greater chilling injury and higher weight loss. The production of ethanol and other metabolites in the juice proved to be low during storage, especially at a constant 6 °C or at 6 °C for 6 days and 14 °C for 1 day cycle, with a marked increase in shelf-life. No endogenous ethylene was produced, and due to their resistance to <b>microbiological</b> <b>infection</b> (with no post-harvest protection), these mandarins responded well to 2 months cold-storage, followed by 2 weeks of shelf-life under all the temperatures tested...|$|E

40|$|Together {{with animal}} experiments, organotypical cell {{cultures}} are important models for analyzing cellular interactions of the mucosal epithelium and pathogenic mechanisms in the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we introduce a three-dimensional culture model from the adult mouse colon for cell biological investigations in an in vivo-like environment. These explant cultures were cultured {{for up to}} 2  weeks and maintained typical characteristics of the intestinal mucosa, including a high-prismatic epithelium with specific epithelial cell-to-cell connections, a basal lamina and various connective tissue cell types, as analyzed with immunohistological and electron microscopic methods. The function of the epithelium was tested by treating the cultures with dexamethasone, {{which resulted in a}} strong upregulation of the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 similar to that found in vivo. The culture system was investigated in infection experiments with the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Wildtype but not Δcph 1 /Δefg 1 -knockout Candida adhered to, penetrated and infiltrated the epithelial barrier.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to help draw {{attention}} to perceived ideas regarding the risk factors and the implied pathogenesis of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and SIDS research in general. Our paper shows there is little if any evidence to support the broadly held notion of an association between respiratory function and sudden infant death syndrome. Researchers who hold to this approach to explain the risk factors of bed-sharing and prone sleep position, etc. have failed to meet the standards of scientific endeavour that we would expect of good research. To counter this imbalance we have proposed an evidence-based explanation for SIDS risk factors showing that microbiological studies of SIDS corroborate epidemiologic and pathological data in establishing a plausible pathogenetic mechanism. We reviewed recent publications on current research and the epidemiology of SIDS and publications on the microbiology of SIDS. Conclusion: Comparison of the data presented, suggest that the risk factors of bed-sharing, and smoke exposure, prone sleep position and alcohol can be explained by the theories of a <b>microbiological</b> <b>infection</b> model of SIDS pathogenesis.

40|$|Microorganisms are {{responsible}} {{for a wide range}} of diseases in man in many cases caused by contaminated water or food. The most important pathogens are Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella, Shigella, Cholera and non-cholera Vibrios and Coliform bacteria. The lecture will provide information about the relevance of these micro organisms for food safety. Sources of contamination include water, food, hygienic circumstances, and person to person contamination. Contaminated water is responsible for health problems including malaria and dysentery. Water-related diseases are the leading cause of death in Africa. Foods that are prone to <b>microbiological</b> <b>infection</b> resulting in food born diseases include milk and milk products, meat and meat products, maize flour, bread, scones, other wheat products,and vegetables. Examples will be given in the presentation. Under-reporting, inadequate investigation of outbreaks and inadequate diagnostic facilities suggest that there are substantially more food borne disease outbreaks than those recorded. This is a matter of high economic impact on a country. The lecture will address ways to improve the situation, how to recognize safe food, what are the essential conditions for a food control system, aspects of a Policy Framework, important aspects of a Surveillance Programme and food Safety Information and Communication aspects will all be discussed during the presentation...|$|E
40|$|Protection of {{the skin}} against <b>microbiological</b> <b>infection</b> is {{provided}} by the permeability barrier and by antimicrobial proteins. We asked whether the expression of murine β-defensins (mBDs) - 1, - 3, and - 14 —orthologs of human β-defensins hBD- 1, - 2, and - 3, respectively—is stimulated by mechanically/physicochemically (tape stripping or acetone treatment) or metabolically (essential fatty acid–deficient (EFAD) diet) induced skin barrier dysfunction. Both methods led to a moderate induction of mBD- 1 and mBD- 14 and a pronounced induction of mBD- 3 mRNA. Protein expression of the mBDs was increased as shown by immunohistology and by western blotting. Artificial barrier repair by occlusion significantly reduced the increased expression of mBD- 14 after mechanical injury and of all three mBDs in EFAD mice, supporting an interrelationship between permeability and the antimicrobial barrier. mBD- 3 expression was stimulated in vitro by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and a neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibody significantly reduced increased mBD- 3 expression after barrier injury in mouse skin, indicating that induction of mBD- 3 expression is mediated by cytokines. The expression of mBD- 14 was stimulated by transforming growth factor-α and not by TNF-α. In summary, we demonstrated upregulation of mBD 1, - 3, and - 14 after mechanically and metabolically induced skin barrier disruption, which may be an attempt to increase defense in the case of permeability barrier dysfunction...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Elevation of soluble major {{histocompatibility}} complex class I chain-related gene A (sMICA) products in serum {{has been linked to}} tissue/organ transplantation, autoimmune diseases and some malignant disorders. Cells infected by microbiological pathogens may release sMICA, whereas less is known whether and to what extent serum sMICA levels may change in infectious diseases. Methods The present study determined serum sMICA levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in a southern China population, including patients (n[*]=[*] 1041) suffering from several types of malignant and infectious diseases and healthy controls (n[*]=[*] 141). Results Relative to controls, serum sMICA elevation was significant in patients of hepatic cancer, and was approaching statistical significance in patients with lung, gastric and nasopharyngeal cancers. sMICA elevation was also associated with some bacterial (Enterobacteriaceae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive cocci), viral (hepatitis B and C) and the Microspironema pallidum infections. Conclusion Serum sMICA levels may be informative for the diagnosis of some malignant and infectious diseases. The results also indicate that <b>microbiological</b> <b>infections</b> should be considered as a potential confounding clinical condition causing serum sMICA elevation while using this test to evaluate the status of other disorders, such as cancers, host-graft response and autoimmune diseases. </p...|$|R
40|$|Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a well-recognized severe {{complication}} of bisphosphonate (BPs) treatment {{in patients with}} osteoporosis or metastatic cancer. <b>Microbiological</b> <b>infection</b> has been hypothesized as a contributing factor to bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). Despite infection being present in BRONJ patients, {{there is no clear}} data as to whether infection plays a role in the pathophysiology. Moreover, microbial cultures have not been helpful in directing therapy because specific pathogens have not been identified. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the bacterial colonization of jawbone and identify the bacterial phylotypes associated with BRONJ. Twenty oncologic patients, aged 48 - 87 years (average age 70. 65 ± 8. 86 years) with BRONJ were enrolled in this study and underwent three different microbiological samplings. Overall, 60 samples were obtained from oral mucosa, necrotic bone fragments and fistula drainage. The same procedure was performed for the laboratory culture of all these specimens. No significant differences regarding either gram+ and gram 9 ̆ 6 species (Chi-squared= 0. 1642; p = 0. 6854) or aerobes and anaerobes bacteria (Chi-squared= 3. 084; p = 0. 0791) were found.

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} have shown microfungi to be prevalent in woods with {{high concentrations of}} naturally decay-resistant compounds and woods preserved with various chemicals. Microfungi may have metal leaching ability or be able of degrading a toxic compound into a less potent form, and {{in such a way}} neutralize wood preservatives. The efficiency of three wood preservatives (Asepas- 1, Dispersan 1. 1. 1 and Arlits), containing copper salts, was tested in contact with agricultural and forest soil. <b>Microbiological</b> <b>infection</b> and weight loss of treated wood blocks were chosen as criterion for wood preservative efficiency evaluation. No representatives of Basidiomycetes that are responsible of wood major decay were isolated from treated samples even after 18 months. Nevertheless the infection of all treated wood blocks by microfungi was noticed and weight losses of wood samples were fixed: the efficiency of preservatives was depended on environment. The greatest weight loss among all tested preservatives in the agricultural soil was of Dispersan 1. 1. 1 treated wood (7. 29 %) but of Arlits – in the forest soil (12. 62 %).

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the survey}} was to prospectively {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the combination therapy cefepime and amikacin in the initial treatment of haematology patients with febrile neutropaenia. Two hundred twenty (220) episodes of febrile neutropaenia were analysed in 54 mates and 82 females (median age 58 years), most patients had a severe neutropaenia with in 72 % of all periods a neutrophil count of less than 100. <b>Microbiological</b> <b>infection</b> was confirmed in 72 cases (32, 8 %). Sixty-one (61) bacteria were isolated from blood cultures of which 22 were identified as Gram-negative bacteria and 38 as Gram-positive bacteria. Sixty-three (63) episodes (28, 6 %) were clinically documented, 85 episodes (38, 6 %) were fever of unknown origin. Clinical cure was achieved in 123 febrile episodes (56 %) after initiation of the current antibiotic protocol; another 22 patients (10 %) became afebrile after modifying the initial antibiotic regimen 48 hours or longer after treatment initiation. In 61 cases (27, 7 %) there was persistent fever or re-occurrence of fever, these cases were considered as treatment failure. Eight patients (3, 6 %) died during the study. This survey has demonstrated that the combination therapy with cefepime and amikacin can be considered as an effective treatment for febrile neutropaenia in high-risk haematological patients in our centre with a high incidence of resistance to Gram-negative bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Plants growing under natural {{conditions}} {{are exposed to}} a variety of stresses, which can lead to undesirable changes in the physiological processes and yielding. These changes can be regulated at different levels, resulting in the synthesis of specific proteins which participate in the plant's response to stress. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine changes in the accumulation of proteins in germinating pea (Pisum sativum L.) seeds under optimal and osmotic (short- and long-term) stress conditions as well as recovery following a short-term stress. For identification of the proteins, two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) were employed. Germination in optimal conditions increased the accumulation of several proteins involved in glycolysis, Krebs cycle, synthesis of fatty acids, cell growth, cellular transport and detoxification. Osmotic stress, in turn, depressed the accumulation of proteins involved in glycolysis, synthesis of fatty acids, detoxication, methionine conversions, cellular transport, translation, growth control and of cytoskeletal proteins, but raised the accumulation of enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle as well as proteins participating in signal transduction and protection (chaperones). One protein, 6 a-hydroxymaackian- 3 -O-methyltransferase, which is involved in the synthesis of pisatin, was present only under osmotic stress conditions and recovery. Pisatin is synthesized mainly in response to <b>microbiological</b> <b>infections</b> and under stress conditions, indicating its key role in the acquisition of stress tolerance by plants...|$|R

40|$|Sick {{building}} syndrome Building-related illness Cancer risk Allergic reactions There {{is a lack}} {{of precision}} in the definition of health, which leads to confusion in the assessment of adverse effects arising from indoor air pollution. Adverse health effects range from annoyance to life-threatening conditions. Survey responses suggest that males and females differ in their perception of a healthy person, but both sexes envisage a male in terms of positive fitness, strength, energy and the possession of an athletic body, rather than how long one was likely to live. Psychological fitness was relatively unimportant in describing the health of others, but was rated as very important with respect to one’s own health. Mortality statistics tend to obscure the proportion of the population who suffer chronic illness that is not life threatening. Although health is largely determined by genetic constitution, lifestyle and environmental factors, the morale of an individual is also important. A new classification of the adverse effects on health of indoor air pollution is proposed: this includes ’comfort’ responses, such as sick building syndrome (category 1); acute biological effects, including allergies and <b>microbiological</b> <b>infections</b> (category 2 A); acute chemi-cal effects, the nature of which depends upon the specific intoxicant (category 2 B), and perceived chronic grave risk, including cancer causation (category 3).

40|$|Based on {{the data}} of the {{literature}} it can be stated that the sprouts fulfill {{the requirements of the}} modern nutritional sciencefor whole-food. Since the biological function of trace elements is outstanding, the objective of this work was to study theenrichment of molybdenum and selenium during germination of wheat- and pea sprouts (Triticum aestivum and Pisumsativum). The total element concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry(ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). During the microbiological analysis of the sprouts,the total plate count, the coliform bacteria count, furthermore the yeast and mould count have been determined by pourplate technique. Due to our experiments, we can draw the conclusion that on the one hand, it is advisable to treat sproutswith molybdenum and selenium, since sprouts are able to uptake these elements in high concentration and in this way theycan contribute to cover our daily molybdenum and selenium needs to a great extent. On the other hand, on the basis of themicrobiological analysis of the seeds, it has become apparent that the microbiological load of the seeds is already high and itincreases during germination.

40|$|Background: The Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia manages {{patients}} with high-risk febrile neutropenia {{and those with}} non-neutropenic immunocompromised states in an outpatient clinic setting. Because the program treats outpatients only, once-daily adminis-tration of IV antibiotics is desirable. A high-dose, once-daily vancomycin nomogram was developed and implemented {{as part of the}} antibiotic treatment regimen. Objective: To determine if therapeutic vancomycin trough levels could be achieved with a high-dose, once-daily regimen in this outpatient setting. Methods: A prospective, single-centre, observational cohort study was conducted over a 7 -month period. Outpatients in the Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program were started on IV vancomycin with the high-dose, once-daily vancomycin nomogram, and outcomes were assessed. Results: Of 48 outpatients treated over the 7 -month period, 10 (21 %) had therapeutic vancomycin trough concentrations (i. e., greater than 10 mg/L). Thirty-five (90 %) of the 39 {{patients with}} suspected clinical infection experienced clinical cure, and 6 (67 %) of the 9 patients with documented <b>microbiological</b> <b>infection</b> experienced microbiological cure.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Microbiological</b> <b>infection</b> plays {{vital role}} in {{determining}} the outcome as well as cost and duration of the hospital stay for patients admitted in ICU setup. Therefore regular surveillance of important pathogens and its resistance pattern is mandatory. Objectives: The objective {{of this study was to}} find out the organisms causes infection in patients admitted in ICUs and to know resistance pattern of isolates. Material & Method: During the period from January 2012 to June 2012, total of 583 samples (blood, respiratory tract, urine etc.) from patients admitted in medical and Neuro-ICUs were collected and processed for culture, identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing according to CLSI recommendations. The medical and microbiological information were recorded from all patients whose samples were collected. Results: Out of 583, 228 (39. 10 %) samples were culture positive. The number of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms isolated were 182 (79. 82 %) and 46 (20. 18 %) respectively. The most frequent Gram-negative organisms isolated were Pseudomonas spp. 53 / 182 (29. 12 %) followed by Acinetobacter spp. 45 (24. 72 %), Klebsiella spp. 42 (28. 08 %), Escherichia coli 35 (19. 23 %) and others 7 (3. 85 %).

40|$|AbstractEthnopharmacological relevanceTithonia diversifolia (Hemsl.) A. Gray {{has been}} {{commonly}} used in folk medicine to treat abscesses, <b>microbiological</b> <b>infections,</b> snake bites, malaria and diabetes. Both anti-inflammatory and anti-malarial properties have been identified using appropriate assays, but the effective doses have demonstrated toxic effects for the experimental animals. Most of the pharmacological activities {{have been attributed to}} sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) and some chlorogenic acid derivatives (CAs) in the leaves of this species. This work aimed to evaluate the repeated-dose toxicity of an aqueous extract (AE) from Tithonia diversifolia leaves and to compare the results with an extract rich in STLs (LRE) and a polar extract (PE) without STLs but rich in CAs. The purpose of this work was to provide insights into the identity of the compounds responsible for the toxic effects of Tithonia diversifolia. Materials and methodsThe major classes of compounds were confirmed in each extract by IR spectra and HPLC-UV-DAD profiling using previously isolated or standard compounds. The toxicity of each extract was evaluated in a repeated-dose toxicity study in Wistar rats for 90 days. ResultsThe AE is composed of both STLs and CAs, the LRE is rich in STLs, and the PE is rich in CAs. The AE caused alterations in haematological parameters but few alterations in biochemical parameters and was relatively safe at doses lower than 100 mg/kg. However, the PE and LRE demonstrated several adverse effects by damaging the liver and kidneys, respectively. ConclusionSTLs and CAs can be toxic in prolonged use at higher doses in extracts prepared from Tithonia diversifolia by affecting the kidneys and liver...|$|R
40|$|Autophagy is a {{catabolic pathway}} that helps cells to survive under {{stressful}} conditions. Cells also use autophagy to clear <b>microbiological</b> <b>infections,</b> but microbes {{have learned how}} to manipulate the autophagic pathway for their own benefit. The experimental evidence obtained in this study suggests that the autophagic flux is blocked at the final steps during the reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) from latency. This is indicated by the level of the lipidated form of LC 3 that does not increase in the presence of bafilomycin and by the lack of colocalization of autophagosomes with lysosomes, which correlates with reduced Rab 7 expression. Since the inhibition of the early phases of autophagy impaired EBV replication and viral particles were observed in autophagic vesicles in the cytoplasm of producing cells, we suggest that EBV exploits the autophagic machinery for its transportation in order to enhance viral production. The autophagic block was not mediated by ZEBRA, an immediate-early EBV lytic gene, whose transfection in Ramos, Akata, and 293 cells promoted a complete autophagic flux. The block occurred only when the complete set of EBV lytic genes was expressed. We suggest that the inhibition of the early autophagic steps or finding strategies to overcome the autophagic block, allowing viral degradation into the lysosomes, can be exploited to manipulate EBV replication. IMPORTANCE This study shows, for the first time, that autophagy is blocked at the final degradative steps during EBV replication in several cell types. Through this block, EBV hijacks the autophagic vesicles for its intracellular transportation and enhances viral production. A better understanding of virus-host interactions could help in the design of new therapeutic approaches against EBV-associated malignancies...|$|R
40|$|Background. No sensitive, {{specific}} marker able {{to discriminate}} favourable or unfavourable outcome of fever of unknown origin (FUO) at diagnosis has been identified. Procalcitonin, a recently assessed infection marker, {{may be useful}} in predicting the outcome of FUO. Methods. We conducted a prospective study examining the following variables: age 0. 5 - 22 years; solid tumour diagnosis; chemotherapy-related grade- 4 febrile neutropenia (FN). A complete clinical, bacteriological and biological evaluation was performed at hospital admission (H 0). Other investigations depended on clinical status. FUO was considered to be of unfavourable outcome if the fever was persistent or re-appeared at day 3 (or later), or if secondary clinical or <b>microbiological</b> <b>infection</b> occurred. To validate the results of the analysis the data set was randomly split into a training set and a validation set. Results. Out of 172 episodes of FN, 136 episodes were classified as FUO (80 %). Seventy-two (53 %) were included in this study. PCT values were significantly higher in episodes of unfavourable outcome (P< 0. 001). None of the other prediction candidates appeared to be significantly linked to the risk of unfavourable outcome. In the validation set, the best PCT cut-off was 0. 12 μ/L, which was associated with a sensitivity of 80 % and specificity of 64 %. Conclusions. PCT-H 0 level can predict FUO outcome. A protocol based on PCT-H 0 measurement, integrating clinical and bacteriological evaluation, facilitates shorter hospital stays and less antibiotic treatment. Patients with a PCT-H 0 value < 0. 12 μ/L could benefit from an outpatient treatment starting at H 48 thus reducing hospitalisation costs and improving quality of life. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether a water-handling hygiene education programme could improve the health-related microbiological quality of container water stored {{and used in}} households in a dense urban settlement in the Free State Province. Previous studies in the area indicated that stored container water became contaminated {{during the process of}} fetching from communal standpipes and then storing and handling the water at home, which exposed the study population to a potential risk of <b>microbiological</b> <b>infection.</b> A water-hygiene education programme was implemented together with a health-related microbiological water quality assessment programme. Members of selected households participated in a series of domestic water-handling hygiene education training sessions over a period of eight months and the quality of their stored water monitored for improvement in tandem over the same period. The results were compared to those of similar tests done during previous studies in the same area. Turbidity, heterotrophic bacteria numbers and total coliform bacteria were used as indicators of general microbial water quality while E. coli bacteria were used to indicate faecal pollution. While the results generally reflected significant improvements for all the indicators from the previous studies, a potential risk of infection was still indicated for consumers. Based on education programme attendance profile, the study sample was divided into frequent, intermittent and never groups. No signficant changes were found in water quality between the three groups, even though the frequent group attended most of the training sessions. This implies that the programme did not have a particular influence on any one group. Container-stored water was still being contaminated in the domestic environment despite the water-handling hygiene education programme. An improved hygiene-education programme appears to be needed to change deep-rooted inherent behaviours such as hand- washing prior to water handling as well as proper protection of container-stored water from environmental contamination...|$|E
30|$|Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} causes of mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) [1]. Secondary peritonitis constitutes 80 – 90  % of cases of IAIs and is originated from the <b>microbiological</b> <b>infection</b> of the gastrointestinal tract by the perforation of hollow organs, ischemia, malignancy, and perioperative complications (anastomotic leakage, intraoperative contamination) [2, 3]. Secondary peritonitis can be classified in community-acquired and hospital-acquired, this latter associated with microorganisms presenting antibiotic resistance [2]. Mortality rate due to secondary peritonitis ranges approximately between 10 and 20  % [4 – 6]. During the management, the clinical outcome of the patient may be critically compromised by the development of nosocomial infections [7]. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a type of hospital-acquired pneumonia that is developed after at least 48  h of the patient’s intubation [8]. VAP is the most frequent of the nosocomial infections occurring in the ICU, affecting to 9 – 27  % of all intubated patients [9]. The VAP is associated with an increased length of hospital stay, of about 4 – 13  days, and hospital costs [10 – 13]. In our knowledge, there are only in the literature three studies analyzing specifically clinical and epidemiological aspects of the development of VAP following secondary peritonitis. The first one was a retrospective study of 1982, which reported clinical outcomes of 143 patients with intra-abdominal abscesses, and revealing an incidence of VAP of 28.7  % of the patients, and a mortality rate attributed to VAP of 65.9  % [14]. The second one was a prospective study published in 1991 comparing clinical outcomes between nosocomial pneumonia and recurrent IAI [15]. The incidence of VAP was 19.7  % of cases, and the mortality rates were 53  % for the group of patients with pneumonia and no recurrent IAI, and 75  % of those with both conditions. Finally, the third study, of 2006, included retrospectively medical records from 618, 495 patients undergoing intra-abdominal surgery [16]. From them, 13, 292 patients developed subsequently pneumonia, and the mortality rate was of 10.7  %.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Giardiasis, or Giardia lamblia infection, is {{the most}} common {{parasitosis}} of the human digestive tract. It is highly contagious and mostly occurs in warm climates. Children are especially susceptible to <b>infection.</b> <b>MICROBIOLOGICAL</b> FEATURES: The <b>infection</b> can sporadically occur anywhere and waterborne outbreaks have been reported in some countries. Hence, the prevention of giardiasis depends on proper sanitation. Once ingested through contaminated water, Giardia cysts adhere to the intestinal surface. The parasite feeds on the mucous secretions of the intestine and may produce severe infections which can interfere with nutrient absorption. Symptoms in affected individuals usually include diarrhoea, dehydration, stomach cramps, gas, and weight loss. DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis is based on the detection of cysts in fecal samples. Treatment includes the use of metronidazole and other drugs that are effective in clearing the infection within a few days. CASE REPORT: We report the recent case of a patient with Giardiasis who received dental hygiene procedures and discuss the interventions required in consideration of the patient's concomitant heart condition.

30|$|The {{most common}} {{bacterial}} and fungal infections {{in our study}} were pneumonia (52 %) followed by skin and soft tissue infections (14 %) {{in agreement with the}} literature [7, 10, 24]. The <b>microbiological</b> spectrum of <b>infections</b> did not differ from previous studies, Gram-negative bacilli being responsible for the majority of bacterial infections [10, 26, 27]. Our study also confirmed the increased incidence of MDR bacteria responsible for both carriage and infections before and after HT [28].|$|R
30|$|The {{association}} of the following variables with hospital mortality was studied through logistic regression models: sex, age, type and duration of immunosuppression, <b>infection,</b> <b>microbiological</b> identification, SAPS II and SOFA (24 h after admission). Two final models including significant (p < 0.2) and clinically relevant variables were built (one included acute dysfunctions variables and the other did not). {{the accuracy of the}} final models and of the physiological scores was calculated using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AU-ROC).|$|R
30|$|Introduction: Sepsis and non-septic Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) are two similar syndromes, which {{differ by}} their cause, sepsis being {{secondary}} to microbial <b>infection.</b> <b>Microbiological</b> tests {{are not enough}} to early affirm the bacterial or fungal origin of the syndrome. More than fifty biomarkers have been proposed for this purpose but none have been repeatedly validated in external populations. Our goal was to address {{the accuracy of the}} biomarkers already reported as being able to efficiently discriminate between sepsis and non-septic SIRS.|$|R
40|$|Background: Neutropenia is a {{major risk}} factor for infection. The {{prevalence}} of Gram-negative bacteria decreased in the early nineties, while the frequency of Gram-positive bacteria increased from between 55 to 70 % of all bacteremia episodes. Even more recently {{there has been a}} resurgence of Gram-negative infections. The aim of this report is to describe the microbiological findings in a cohort of febrile neutropenic patients in a tertiary teaching hospital of Southern Brazil.  Methods: This was a cohort study designed to evaluate the implementation of a clinical protocol for treatment of febrile neutropenic patients. Prospectively included in our study were patients with febrile neutropenia (FN) admitted between January 2004 and December 2005 at the Hospital de Clínicas of Porto Alegre. Historical controls were selected from patient visits recorded between March 2001 and April 2003 ‒ or recorded before the clinical protocol was introduced.  Results: During the 2004 - 2005 and 2001 - 2003 study periods, 164 and 159 pathogens were documented, respectively. In 93 of 190 episodes (48. 9 %), and 84 of 193 episodes (43. 5 %) there were documented <b>microbiological</b> <b>infections.</b> Fungal infection was documented in very few episodes (6. 1 vs. 5. 7 %). We also observed a 52. 8 % prevalence of Gram-positive and a 47. 2 % prevalence of Gram-negative bacteria in the 2001 ‒ 2003 period. Observed in the 2004 ‒ 2005 period were 38. 1 % Gram-positive and 61. 9 % Gram-negative bacteria (P= 0. 012). There was also a significant increase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa prevalence in the second study period (1. 9 to 11. 6 %; P< 0. 001). Six isolates (31. 6 %) were discovered to be multi-resistant in the 2004 ‒ 2005 period versus none in the first period. The prevalence of Oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus was 53. 5 and 65. 8 % in the first and second periods, respectively (P= 0. 23).  Conclusion: These documented pathogens are the most commonly observed in febrile neutropenic patients, but the emergence of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa is of some concern...|$|R
25|$|Diphtheria {{is usually}} spread between people by direct contact {{or through the}} air. It may also be spread by {{contaminated}} objects. Some people carry the bacteria without having symptoms, but can still spread the disease to others. The three main types of C. diphtheriae cause different severities of disease. The symptoms are due to a toxin produced by the bacteria. Diagnosis can often be made based on {{the appearance of the}} throat with confirmation by <b>microbiological</b> culture. Previous <b>infection</b> may not prevent against future infection.|$|R
