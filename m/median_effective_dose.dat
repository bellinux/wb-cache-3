The apoptosis pathway was shown to involve the proteolytic activation of MST/Krs proteins by caspase-3 which results in the activation of p36 MBP kinase {{through the creation of}} ROS. The concentrations needed to induce this pathway were found to be the same required to induce apoptosis on HL-60 cells. Cyt A also activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and its apoptotic effects are inhibited by dominant negative c-Jun.

The {{purpose of this study}} was estimation of the <b>median</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> of anti spasmodicmedicine in adaptive design and comparison the precision of the estimation with conventional paralleldesign. Materials and Methods: Seventy guinea pigs were divided into seven groups (n= 10) and each groupwas studied for one dose. One of the adaptive designs that uses frequently in pharmaceutical studies isup-and-down design. In this design, the number of samples in each dose was determined. Then forestimation of <b>median</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose,</b> we used a method of the combination of dose-response logistic,dose-response log-linear, linear and Emax models and R software was used for data analysis. Result: In parallel design, number of samples in each dose was 10, but in adaptive design, number ofsamples in 10 − 3 and 10 − 4 doses was 21 and other doses were 7. MSE in parallel design was 59 and inadaptive design were 21. Estimation of <b>median</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> in dose-response logistic was 8 × 10 − 5, indose-response log-linear 8 × 10 − 6, in Emax 8 × 10 − 7 and in linear model was 5 × 10 − 6.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the effective dose that is currently used in CT colonography using scan parameters that were collected for this purpose, and to investigate trends in time. PubMed was systematically searched from 1996 until January 2004 for studies investigating CT colonography. Research institutions were contacted and asked for their current scan protocol. Thirty-six institutions published 74 studies. Twenty-eight of the 36 institutions provided their current protocol. The <b>median</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> in 2004 was 5. 1 mSv (range 1. 2 - 11. 7 mSv) per position. Most institutions (93 %) scan in both the supine and prone positions.

In acute {{organophosphate}} poisoning {{the issue}} of special concern is the appearance of muscle fasciculations and convulsions that cannot be adequately antagonised {{by the use of}} atropine and oxime therapy. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine atidotal effect of obidoxime or HI- 6 combinations with memantine in mice poisoned with soman, dichlorvos or heptenophos. Methods. Male Albino mice were pretreated intravenously (iv) with increasing doses of oximes and/or memantine (10 mg/kg) at various times before poisoning with 1. 3 LD- 50 of soman, dichlorvos or heptenophos, in order to determine the <b>median</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> and the efficacy half-time. In a separate experiment, cerebral extravasation of Evans blue dye (40 mg/kg iv) was examined after application of memantine (10 mg/kg iv), midazolam (2. 5 mg/kg intraperitonealy - ip) and ketamine (20 mg/kg ip) 5 minutes before soman (1 LD- 50 subcutaneously - sc). Results. Coadministration of memantine induced a significant decrease in <b>median</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> in null time of both HI- 6 (7. 96 vs 1. 79 mmoL/kg in soman poisoning) and obidoxime (16. 80 vs 2. 75 mmoL/kg in dichlorvos poisoning; 21. 56 vs 6. 63 mmoL/kg in heptenophos poisoning).

40|$|Background—Because of {{the higher}} {{radiosensitivity}} of infants and children compared with adults, {{there is a need}} to evaluate the doses delivered to pediatric patients who undergo interventional cardiac procedures. However, knowledge of the effective dose in pediatric interventional cardiology is very limited. Methods and Results—For an accurate risk estimation, a patient-specific Monte Carlo simulation of the effective dose was set up in 60 patients with congenital heart disease who underwent diagnostic (n 28) or therapeutic (n 32) cardiac catheterization procedures. The dose-saving effect of using extra copper filtration in the x-ray beam was also investigated. For diagnostic cardiac catheterizations, a <b>median</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> of 4. 6 mSv was found. Therapeutic procedures resulted in a higher <b>median</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> of 6. 0 mSv because of the prolonged use of fluoroscopy. The overall effect of inserting extra copper filtration into the x-ray beam was a total effective dose reduction of 18 % with no detrimental effect on image quality. An excellent correlation between the dose-area product and effective patient dose was found (r 0. 95). Hence, dose-area product is suitable for online estimation of the effective dose with good accuracy. With all procedures included, the resulting median lifetime risk for stochastic effects was 0. 08 %. Conclusions—Because of the high radiation exposure, it is important to monitor patient dose by dose-area product instrumentation and to use additional beam filtration to keep the effective dose as low as possible in view of the sensitivity of the pediatric patients.

The combinations of the sub - <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> of each of KGA and KGN (100 mg/kg) with ART (0. 2 mg/kg) were similarly evaluated and assessed. Results: The <b>median</b> <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> (ED 50) were 0. 29, 140 and 160 mg/kg for Artemisinin, KGA and KGN, respectively. The combinations (KGA: ART and KGN: ART) resulted in improved parasitemia suppression which were statistically significant (P =. 05) when compared with the percentage parasitaemia obtained for individual agents of the combinations. Conclusion: Extracts of K. grandifoliola potentiated the antimalarial activity of Artemisinin. The results showed beneficial interaction with potentials in antimalarial combination therapy...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{superior}} long-term patency of arterial grafts, surgeons are often {{reluctant to use}} arterial grafts on coronary vessels that supply large areas of myocardium because postoperative shock may occur. We hypothesized that supramaximal flow through small arterial conduits would decrease distal intraluminal pressure, thereby reducing afterload on the smooth muscle and rendering the arterial graft vulnerable to spasm. Fourteen internal thoracic and eight gastroepiploic arteries were harvested from adult pigs (220 to 250 pounds). Arteries were mounted on a computer-controlled perfusion system with inflow pressure at 80 mm Hg and outflow resistance adjusted to simulate normal (in situ) or supramaximal (coronary artery bypass graft) flow demands. Artery pressures and flow rates were measured at baseline and after norepinephrine {{was added to the}} system. Internal thoracic arteries had no hemodynamic response to norepinephrine at normal flow. Under supramaximal flow demands, large internal thoracic arteries (2. 5 to 3. 0 mm) had no hemodynamic response to norepinephrine. However, for small internal thoracic arteries (2. 1 to 2. 9 mm), norepinephrine reduced distal internal thoracic arterial pressure (63. 2 ± 2. 2 to 27. 0 ± 1. 9 mm Hg) and flow rate (99. 4 ± 5. 0 to 45. 4 ± 2. 7 ml/min, <b>median</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> = 9. 12 x 10 − 9 mol/L). Under normal flow demands, the flow rate in gastroepiploic arteries (1. 0 to 2. 0 mm diamet decreased (14. 1 ± 0. 5 to 4. 8 ± 0. 8 ml/min, p < 0. 05) only at high concentrations of norepinephrine (<b>median</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> = 1. 26 × 10 − 6 mol/L). Supramaximal flow demands reduced distal gastroepiploic arterial pressure (77. 5 ± 0. 5 to 49. 5 ± 3. 8 mm Hg, p < 0. 05), which resulted in a greater decrease in flow rate (80. 0 ± 3. 7 to 6. 8 ± 1. 6 ml/min, p < 0. 05) at lower concentrations of norepinephrine, (<b>median</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> = 3. 24 × 10 − 8 mol/L, p < 0. 05). In four studies in internal thoracic arteries and eight in gastroepiploic arteries, arteries were cut in half, reattached, and reperfused. The proximal half of the internal thoracic artery did not respond to norepinephrine, but the distal half had a 53 % ± 7 % decrease in flow. Both gastroepiploic artery halves reacted and flow rate decreased by 88 % ± 2 % (proximal half) and 89 % ± 3 % (distal half). In conclusion, small arterial conduits develop large transconduit pressure gradients under supramaximal flow demands. Under these conditions, arteries are very sensitive to vasoconstrictors and flow may cease with higher drug concentrations. Myocardial failure after arterial bypass grafting to coronary vessels supplying large amounts of myocardium may result from an increased sensitivity to vasoconstriction leading to graft spasm and myocardial ischemia...|$|E

40|$|Although the {{anticonvulsant}} {{activity of}} 3 -hydroxy- 3 -ethyl- 3 -phenylproionamide (HEPP) is well-known, its use {{is limited by}} the pharmacotoxicological profile. We herein tested its fluorinated and chlorinated derivatives (F-HEPP and Cl-HEPP) with two seizure models, maximal electroshock seizures (MES), and intraperitoneal pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) administration. Neurotoxicity was examined via the rotarod test. With in silico methods, binding was probed on possible protein targets—GABAA receptors and the sodium channel Nav 1. 2. The <b>median</b> <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> (ED 50) of HEPP, F-HEPP, and Cl-HEPP in the MES seizure model were 129. 6, 87. 1, and 62. 0 [*]mg/kg, respectively, and 66. 4, 43. 5, and in the PTZ seizure model 43. 5 [*]mg/kg. The HEPP-induced neurotoxic effect, which occurred at twice the ED 50 against MES (p< 0. 05), did not occur with F-HEPP or Cl-HEPP. Docking studies revealed that all tested ligands bound to GABAA receptors on a site near to the benzodiazepine binding site. However, on the sodium channel open pore Nav 1. 2, R-HEPP had interactions similar to those reported for phenytoin, while its enantiomer and the ligands F-HEPP and Cl-HEPP reached a site that could disrupt the passage of sodium. Our results show that, as anticonvulsant agents, parahalogen substituted compounds have an advantageous pharmacotoxicological profile compared to their precursor...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{technique}} of epidural volume extension (EVE) involves the injection of saline into the extradural space {{immediately following the}} intrathecal injection, {{as part of a}} combined spinal-epidural (CSE) anaesthetic. One of the suggested benefits of EVE is a reduction in local anaesthetic required. The aim {{of this study was to}} test this hypothesis by comparing the <b>median</b> <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> (ED 50) of hyperbaric bupivacaine with fentanyl 25 mg with and without EVE for Caesarean section. Methods. Sixty women were randomized to receive either CSE anaesthesia with EVE (EVE group) or no EVE (NEVE group). Using a double-blinded, up-down sequential technique, varying doses of bupivacaine with fentanyl 25 mg were administered. ED 50 was estimated from up-down reversals and probit regression. Results. The ED 50 for bupivacaine was similar and not significantly different in the two groups (5. 1 mg in the EVE and 6. 1 mg in the NEVE group; difference 1. 0 mg, 95 % CI 0. 12 to 2. 2, P= 0. 08). Conclusions. This study illustrates that whilst low doses of intrathecal bupivacaine can be effectively used for Caesarean section, at such doses EVE does not appear to offer reliable or clinically relevant reductions in dosing with intrathecal bupivacaine...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{diagnostic}} performance of cone-beam CT (CBCT) -guided and CT fluoroscopy (fluoro-CT) -guided technique for transthoracic needle biopsy (TNB) of lung nodules. Methods: The hospital records of 319 consecutive patients undergoing 324 TNBs of lung nodules {{in a single}} radiology unit in 2009 – 2013 were retrospectively evaluated. The newly introduced CBCT technology was used to biopsy 123 nodules; 201 nodules were biopsied by conventional fluoro-CT-guided technique. We assessed {{the performance of the}} two biopsy systems for diagnosis of malignancy and the radiation exposure. Results: Nodules biopsied by CBCT-guided and by fluoro-CT-guided technique had similar characteristics: size, 20 ± 6. 5 mm (mean ± standard deviation) vs. 20 ± 6. 8 mm (p = 0. 845); depth from pleura, 15 ± 15 mm vs. 15 ± 16 mm (p = 0. 595); malignant, 60 % vs. 66 % (p = 0. 378). After a learning period, the newly introduced CBCT-guided biopsy system and the conventional fluoro-CT-guided system showed similar sensitivity (95 % and 92 %), specificity (100 % and 100 %), accuracy for diagnosis of malignancy (96 % and 94 %), and delivered non-significantly different <b>median</b> <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> [11. 1 mSv (95 % CI 8. 9 – 16. 0) vs. 14. 5 mSv (95 % CI 9. 5 – 18. 1); p = 0. 330]. Conclusion: The CBCT-guided and fluoro-CT-guided systems for lung nodule biopsy are similar in terms of diagnostic performance and <b>effective</b> <b>dose,</b> and may be alternatively used to optimize the available technological resources. Key Points: • CBCT-guided and fluoro-CT-guided lung nodule biopsy provided high and similar diagnostic accuracy. • <b>Effective</b> <b>dose</b> from CBCT-guided and fluoro-CT-guided lung nodule biopsy was similar. • To optimize resources, CBCT-guided lung nodule biopsy may be an alternative to fluoro-CT-guided...|$|R
