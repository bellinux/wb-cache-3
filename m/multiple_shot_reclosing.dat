40|$|AbstractIt {{is shown}} that {{superimposed}} <b>multiple</b> <b>shots</b> of linearly polarized 800 -nm, 100 -fs laser pulses at lower fluence than the single-pulse ablation threshold produce periodic nanostructures with almost constant periods of 150 nm and 400 nm on silicon surface immersed in water. The nanostructure formation and its characteristic properties observed are illustrated {{well with the}} excitation of surface plasmon polaritons in the newly created surface layer. Pump and probe measurements of surface reflectivity during the ultrafast interaction demonstrate that <b>multiple</b> <b>shots</b> of low-fluence fs pulses are crucial to the accumulation of non-thermal bonding structure change and subsequent ablation for the periodic nanostructure formation...|$|R

40|$|Modeling sound {{propagation}} {{is an essential}} tool to assess the risk of air-gun shots on marine mammals. Based on a 2. 5 D finite-difference code a new full waveform modeling approach will be presented, which determines both SELs of single shots and cumulative SELs of <b>multiple</b> <b>shots</b> fired along a seismic line. Point source approximations of air-gun clusters typically deployed by R/V Polarstern in polar regions are used as sound sources. Marine mammals are simulated as static receivers. Applications to deep and shallow water models including constant and depth-dependent sound velocity profiles show dipole-like directivities in case of single shots and tubular cumulative SEL fields beneath the seismic line in case of <b>multiple</b> <b>shots.</b> Compared to a semi-infinite model the incorporation of sea floor reflections enhances the seismically induced noise close to the sea surface. Refraction due to sound velocity gradients and sound channeling in near-surface ducts are evident, but affect only low to moderate levels. Hence, exposure zone radii derived for different critical hearing thresholds are almost independent of the sound velocity structure. With decreasing thresholds radii increase according to a spherical spreading law in case of single shots and according to a cylindrical spreading law in case of <b>multiple</b> <b>shots...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} <b>multiple</b> <b>shot</b> noise process and its integral. We analyse these two {{processes}} systematically for their theoretical distributions, {{based on the}} piecewise deterministic Markov process theory developed by Davis [1] and the martingale methodology used by Dassios and Jang [2]. The analytic expressions of the Laplace transforms of these two processes are presented. We also obtain the multivariate probability generating function {{for the number of}} jumps, for which we use a multivariate Cox process. To derive these, we assume that the Cox processes jumps, intensity jumps and primary event jumps are independent of each other. Using the Laplace transform of the integral of <b>multiple</b> <b>shot</b> noise process, we obtain the tail of multivariate distributions of the first jump times of the Cox processes, i. e. the multivariate survival functions. Their numerical calculations and other relevant joint distributions’ numerical values are also presented. 12 page(s...|$|R
