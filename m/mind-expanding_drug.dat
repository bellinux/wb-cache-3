50|$|Dr. Savary (Elliott), a {{sinister}} biochemist, {{has created a}} subhuman species that dwells in London's underground. Addicted to Savary's <b>mind-expanding</b> <b>drug,</b> his creations suffer from grotesque disfigurements.

50|$|Linnear and Saigō {{are portrayed}} as opposites. Linnear is a {{somewhat}} cold hero, and Saigō is a violent and dangerous foe. Both are equally skilled in their disciplines, differing only in the philosophy that drives them. Both men are troubled. Saigō battles with his inner demon of self-doubt, often resorting to <b>mind-expanding</b> <b>drugs,</b> whilst Nicholas is a man torn between two worlds and feeling he belongs to neither.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a pioneer}} {{advocate}} of hallucinogens, Janiger introduced LSD to Cary Grant, Aldous Huxley, and other celebrities, {{taking the drug}} 13 times himself. He {{was interested in the}} relationship between creativity and <b>mind-expanding</b> <b>drugs.</b> He said,It really took me out of a state in which I saw the boundaries of myself and the world around me very rigorously prescribed, to a state in which I saw that many, many things were possible...|$|R
5000|$|The 1960s was {{a decade}} of ferment in the arts, society, and politics. So many things that had been viewed complacently, {{in a world that}} seemed always to be the same as it ever was, were {{suddenly}} cast in a new light. And this led to a desire to cast off the old ways, to break all the rules, to find new directions and new freedoms. There were no limits, nothing that could not be tried, from rising up to protest injustices like racism, sexism, and the Vietnam War to ingesting <b>mind-expanding</b> <b>drugs</b> to sexual experimentation. - Sally Banes, Reinventing Dance in the 1960s: Everything was Possible ...|$|R
5000|$|Thousands of {{snapshots}} {{on police}} station walls remain the only link between many of America's most affluent {{families and the}} children who embodied their great expectations. Nearly everyone in the hippie community smokes marijuana — whether they call it pot, grass, hemp, gage, joint or mary jane — the marijuana is the basic background for the shared drug experience. The experience is shared {{to such an extent}} that roach pipes are always in demand — a roach is a marijuana butt and it requires some form of holder for those last few drags. The new generation, whether they are runaways or rebels-in-residence, use marijuana as a symbol of discontent with the basic values of the establishment. For some, there exists a social imperative beyond flaunting society's rules — for these adventurers the <b>mind-expanding</b> <b>drugs</b> open a window on a whole new frontier..." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{result of}} Wilson's {{increasingly}} artistic interpretations of pop music form helped transform the California Sound {{into a more}} musically ambitious and mature world view. Melcher soon worked with the Byrds, producing their 1965 folk rock single [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man". Its recording was based on Wilson's production approach to [...] "Don't Worry Baby". Melcher's [...] "commercially golden formula" [...] with the Byrds was immediately co-opted by many Los Angeles-based recording artists such as the Turtles, the Leaves, Sonny & Cher, and Barry McGuire. The lyricism behind the California Sound gradually became {{less to do with}} surfing and cars and more about social consciousness and political awareness. In Bill Flanagan's view, after the Beach Boys epitomized the California Sound, Crosby, Stills, & Nash [...] "ratified it". Arnold Shaw summarized in The Rock Revolution (1969): The California Sound went from one extreme to another—from [...] "Be true to your school!" [...] to [...] "Let's freak out!", from the Surf Sound to fuzztone and feedback, from celebration of the open road to a search for strange inner experiences, from the thrill of speed to liberation through sensory overload, from the excitement of bodily motion to the explosiveness of <b>mind-expanding</b> <b>drugs,</b> and from the Beach Boys to the Mothers of Invention—a process in which the Boys themselves underwent an audible, if not visible, transformation.|$|R
50|$|The {{title of}} the book gives a clear {{indication}} of Trocchi's intentions. He casts himself as beyond society, above laws and morals and wars and guilt. He did not see himself as just a junky but rather a crusader, the <b>mind-expanding</b> quality of <b>drugs,</b> as he saw it, outweighed any other argument against them. But as Trocchi's later life was to show, his own addiction prevented him from finishing any other book-length project.|$|R
