50|$|For the network, it is {{possible}} to use traffic shaping techniques to limit the amount of traffic that each VM can impose on the host. Also, it {{is possible}} to install multiple network adapters on the same physical host, and configure the virtualization layer so that each VM may grant exclusive access to each one of them. For example, this is possible with the driver domains of the Xen hypervisor. Multi-queue network adapters exist which support multiple VMs at the hardware level, having separate packet queues associated to the different hosted VMs (by means of the IP addresses of the VMs), such as the Virtual <b>Machine</b> <b>Device</b> Queue (VMDq) devices by Intel. Finally, real-time scheduling of the CPU may also be used for enhancing temporal isolation of network traffic from multiple VMs deployed on the same CPU.|$|E

30|$|In group paging, heavy RACHs {{collisions}} {{are found}} {{at the beginning of}} the group paging interval due to the simultaneous channel accesses from the whole group of machine devices. A randomized paging response method has been proposed in 3 GPP SA 2 to deal with the heavy collision problem but without any follow-up work. In [11], the authors proposed a pre-backoff scheme to relief the heavy collision problem. The pre-backoff scheme enforces each <b>machine</b> <b>device</b> to perform a random backoff before its first preamble transmission. A preliminary study of the pre-backoff scheme in group paging via computer simulations was presented in [12]. The results showed that the pre-backoff scheme may properly reduce the heavy collision problem. However, it is not clear how to determine the optimum pre-backoff window size under a given group size.|$|E

The main contribution of this work is the low cost technology offered for laboratories, without high priced servo-hydraulic testing machines, giving them autonomy for the execution of fracture toughness tests.

30|$|Machine-type {{communication}} (MTC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important services for next generation networks. 3 GPP, IEEE and other international organizations adopt their technologies to the emerging market of the MTC [1]. Mass <b>machine</b> <b>devices</b> that simultaneously access the network may result in heavy collisions and thus, degrade the network performance [1, 2]. In 3 GPP [3], a concept of group paging has been introduced to alleviate the heavy collision problem in the random access channels (RACHs) of the cellular networks. However, no normative specification work on group issues took place. It may restart again in the next 3 GPP Release 13. In group paging, the base station, which is known as an evolved-NodeB (eNB) in 3 GPP, can assign a number of <b>machine</b> <b>devices</b> to form a paging group. The eNB can then simultaneously activate the group of <b>machine</b> <b>devices</b> by sending a single group paging message. Upon receiving the group paging message, all <b>machine</b> <b>devices</b> belonging to the paging group should immediately perform the random access (RA) procedure to access the network during a period of time, which is referred as a group paging interval herein [4].|$|R

30|$|For {{the first}} category, {{the focus is}} to reduce either {{signaling}} overhead for small data transmission or contention probability, since both reduce the transmitted bits for MTC devices and thus help energy saving. For MTC with lots of fixed-location machines, Ko et al. [78] propose a novel random access scheme based on fixed TA (timing alignment) for a OFDMA-based cellular system. The proposal {{is based on the}} assumption that the TA value between each fixed-location <b>machine</b> <b>device</b> and eNB is fixed and unchanged, and the MTC devices store the TA value acquired from the initial RA access and compare it with the TA values obtained from the subsequent random access procedure. In case of mismatch of TA values, MTC devices directly start the retransmission procedure to avoid possible collision after waiting a randomly selected backoff time. Otherwise, the devices continue the conventional procedure. However, this proposal is only applicable to M 2 M with stationary devices and has a limited effect on energy efficiency.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{computational}} model of control of a <b>machine,</b> <b>device</b> or software programme by an autonomous agent, which may be remote. The model allows for different degrees of remote and mediated control, and seeks to represent a common situation with the remote use of scientific instruments. We present the model both as a logical language and through a formal diagrammatic semantics, {{in the form of}} encapsulated and annotated graphs. The model supports automated reasoning over access powers, including the automated allocation of powers to a remote user by the owner of a device. In addition, the model enables an intelligent agent to select appropriate multi-agent protocols to engage in argument about access to a device or the details of actions to be undertaken using the device. The key value of this work is in automating access and in enabling automated reasoning over complex networks of devices...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{properties}} of a queueing network is stability. Roughly speaking, it is the property that {{the total number of}} jobs in the network remains bounded as a function of time. One of the key questions related to the stability issue is how to determine the exact conditions under which a given queueing network operating under a given scheduling policy remains stable. While there was much initial progress in addressing this question, most of the results obtained were partial at best and so the complete characterization of stable queueing networks is still lacking. In this paper, we resolve this open problem, albeit in a somewhat unexpected way. We show that characterizing stable queueing networks is an algorithmically undecidable problem for the case of nonpreemptive static buffer priority scheduling policies and deterministic interarrival and service times. Thus, no constructive characterization of stable queueing networks operating under this class of policies is possible. The result is established for queueing networks with finite and infinite buffer sizes and possibly zero service times, although we conjecture that it also holds in the case of models with only infinite buffers and nonzero service times.
