5|$|Since the {{practical}} function of striping {{has not been}} determined for zebras in general, it is unclear why the quagga lacked stripes on its hind parts. A cryptic function for protection from predators (stripes obscure the individual zebra in a herd) and biting flies (which are less attracted to striped objects), as well as various social functions, have been proposed for zebras in general. Differences in hind quarter stripes may have aided species recognition during stampedes of <b>mixed</b> <b>herds,</b> so that members of one subspecies or species would follow its own kind. It has also been evidence that the zebras developed striping patterns as thermoregulation to cool themselves down, and that the quagga lost them due to living in a cooler climate, although one problem with {{this is that the}} mountain zebra lives in similar environments and has a bold striping pattern. A 2014 study strongly supported the biting-fly hypothesis, and the quagga appears to have lived in areas with lesser amounts of fly activity compared to other zebras.|$|E

50|$|The Safari {{began as}} a small children's zoo in the National Park of Ramat Gan in 1958. In the late 1960s, the {{founding}} director Mr. Zvi Kirmeyer, {{was inspired by the}} novel concept of Safari Parks which were developing around the world during 1966-1974. He convinced the first mayor of Ramat Gan, Avraham Krinitzi, that a drive-through Safari Park in Israel was a viable idea. Following the tragic death of Mayor Krinitzi in an auto accident in 1969, the project continued with the active involvement of the next mayor of Ramat Gan, Dr. Yisrael Peled. Half of the existing National Park in Ramat Gan was dedicated to the new entity called The Zoological Corporation of Ramat Gan (250-acres). The Israeli landscape architect firm Miller-Blum-Lederer designed the park. The animals were supplied by Carr-Hartley from Tanzania, in 1968 and 1972 and included seven African elephants, eight white rhinos, Grant's zebras, Thomson's gazelles, defassa waterbuck, eland, ostriches, Masai giraffe, Grant's gazelles, beisa oryx, dik-diks, Grévy's zebra and De Brazza's monkeys. The drive-through African park opened to the public in 1974 although no formal opening was held due to the Yom Kippur war. To this day the drive-through African Safari section, with its large and dynamic <b>mixed</b> <b>herds</b> of 13 species of mammals and birds, is the signature area for the visitor experience.|$|E
50|$|Quaggas {{were said}} to be lively and highly strung, {{especially}} the stallions. During the 1830s, quaggas were used as harness animals for carriages in London, the males probably being gelded to mitigate their volatile nature.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{investigated}} why {{males and females}} segregate spatially in sexually dimorphic species. These studies have focused primarily on temperate zone ungulates in areas lacking intact predator communities, and few have directly assessed predation rates in different social environments. Data on the movement, social affiliation, mortality and foraging of radio-collared African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) were collected from 2001 – 06 in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. The vast majority of mortality events were due to lion (Panthera leo) predation, and the mortality hazard associated with being an adult male buffalo in a male-only 'bachelor' group was almost four times higher than for adult females in <b>mixed</b> <b>herds.</b> The mortality rates of adult males and females within <b>mixed</b> <b>herds</b> were not statistically different. Mortality sites {{of male and female}} buffalo were in areas of low visibility similar to those used by bachelor groups, while <b>mixed</b> <b>herds</b> tended to use more open habitats. Males in bachelor groups ate similar or higher quality food (as indexed by percentage faecal nitrogen), and moved almost a third less distance per day compared with <b>mixed</b> <b>herds.</b> As a result, males in bachelor groups gained more body condition than did males in breeding herds. Recent comparative analyses suggest the activity-budget hypothesis as a common underlying cause of social segregation. However, our intensive study, in an area with an intact predator community showed that male and female buffalo segregated by habitat and supported the predation-risk hypothesis. Male African buffalo appear to trade increased predation risk for additional energy gains in bachelor groups, which presumably leads to increased reproductive success...|$|E

The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to determine the effect of supplemented conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on milk production and milk composition of lactating dairy cows in production systems commonly used in South Africa. In the first of three trials, samples of 24 bulk tanks were collected to get an impression of the CLA status of milk in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Six samples were each collected from Jersey and Holstein <b>herds</b> in total <b>mixed</b> ration (TMR) -based systems. Another six samples were each collected from Jersey and Holstein herds on pasture-based systems. An additional three samples were also collected from co-op silos. One of these came from a <b>mixed</b> <b>herd</b> on TMR, one from a Jersey herd on TMR and the third sample from a <b>mixed</b> <b>herd</b> on pasture. The CLA levels of the milk were within the range reported in literature, albeit on the low side. The mean CLA level in milk fat of cows from pasture and TMR-based systems were 10. 5 and 5. 45 mg/g of fatty acids, respectively. This is in agreement with trends reported in the literature with cows on pasture having higher levels of CLA in their milk than cows on TMR’s.

40|$|Nomadic {{pastoralism}} {{has been}} the traditional method of utilizing grazing resources in arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. However, increased sedentarization accompanied by growing human and animal populations {{during the past two}} decades is thought to be accelerating the desertification process, or desert expansion. The specific interactions of the grazing animal with this process has been speculated upon but not studied in detail. A comparative study was initiated during the spring grazing season of 1974 to determine sheep and goat nutritional and production responses, as well as patterns of vegetative selection and utilization under the pastoral system currently employed in the Pre-Saharan region of southern Tunisia. The study site was located on a sandy soil dominated by the perennial shrub, Rhanterium suaveolens. Annual herbs were co-dominants of this community in early spring. Four grazing treatments were employed during a month-long grazing season. These included; sheep grazing alone, goats grazing alone, sheep grazing with goats, and goats grazing with sheep. Stocking rates (1. 9 sheep or goats per hectare per month) were comparable to those locally employed. Dietary composition was determined for randomly selected animals by a modified bite-count method, Forage intake was determined by the equation, I = F/ 1 -D where I represented intake rate, F represented fecal output as determined from collections using standard fecal bags, and D represented digestibility of composite diets as determined by in vitro techniques. Animals were weighed weekly. Diets of all treatment groups, except goats in the <b>mixed</b> <b>herd,</b> consisted primarily of annuals during the first week. During Week Two there was a gradual shift to perennials and by the third week, all treatment groups selected primarily perennial species for their diets, Perennials comprised over 90 % of the diets, except for sheep in the <b>mixed</b> <b>herd,</b> by the end of the fourth week. Also, by Week Four, Rhanterium comprised 71 - 92 % of the diets. Estimates of forage quality indicated a declining trend in nutritional value of the forage over the grazing period. Dry matter consumption, digestibility of the diets, consumption of apparent digestible energy, dietary crude protein and apparent digestible protein all decreased from Week One to Week Four. These changes were probably attributable to a combination of factors including a decrease in plant species availability due to grazing, maturation of the remaining vegetation and a dietary shift from annuals to perennials. Young animals gained weight at generally increasing rates throughout the grazing trial. Adult animals gained weight after the initial week but their rate of gain indicated a leveling off or even a decrease by the fourth week, probably in response to declining forage quality. Animals in the <b>mixed</b> <b>herd</b> traveled farther during daily grazing periods than either of the single species herds. Goats grazing alone traveled farther than sheep grazing alone. Goats in the <b>mixed</b> <b>herd</b> may have influenced the sheep in that herd to travel more than sheep grazing alone...|$|R

50|$|The social {{structure}} of gazelles consists of several types of groups. Male gazelles are territorial throughout their adult lives, though not usually before {{two to three years}} of age. During the nonterritorial periods, males usually spend their time in bachelor groups or as part of a <b>mixed</b> <b>herd.</b> Likewise, females will form migratory female groups that travel through the males' territories. As the female groups pass through, the territorial males will try to herd them to prevent them from leaving. Adult males with adjoining territories will engage in combat several times a day, fighting with their horns to establish dominance and the boundaries of their territories. In this way, the accepted boundaries of the territory can change on a daily basis. If a lone male, a bachelor group, or in some cases even an adolescent male fawn of a female gazelle should be passing through a territorial male's region, the male will chase the offender out of his territory. Interestingly, this territoriality does not extend to males of other species.|$|R

The assay is performed in a reverse micellar medium composed of mixed buffer (2 -amino- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol buffer pH 9. 0 and borate buffer pH 9. 0) in AOT/isooctane, at a temperature of 38 degrees C. Total test time is 450 s. Reaction rates are linear (except for butter) up to 8. 5 and 11 % (v/v) raw milk, for whole milk and chocolate milk, respectively. The detection limits are 0. 04, 0. 4 and 0. 22 % (v/v) raw milk, for whole milk, chocolate milk and butter, respectively.
