25|$|Not every {{conjecture}} ends {{up being}} proven true or false. The continuum hypothesis, which tries to ascertain the relative cardinality of certain infinite sets, was eventually shown to be undecidable (or independent) from the generally accepted set of axioms of set theory. It is therefore possible to adopt this statement, or its negation, as a new axiom in a consistent manner (<b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> take Euclid's parallel postulate as either true or false).|$|E
25|$|If {{people ask}} {{in the name}} of {{religion}} we must help them. The vehicle of this support is a complete boycott of the enemies' goods. Each riyal, dirham …etc. used to buy their goods eventually becomes bullets to be fired at the hearts of brothers and children in Palestine. For this reason, it is an obligation not to help them (the enemies of Islam) by buying their goods. To buy their goods is to support tyranny, oppression and aggression. Buying goods from them will strengthen them; our duty is to make them as weak as we can. Our obligation is to strengthen our resisting brothers in the Sacred Land as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can.</b> If we cannot strengthen the brothers, we have a duty to make the enemy weak. If their weakness cannot be achieved except by boycott, we must boycott them.|$|E

500|$|The {{conditions}} for the Americans constructing the siege works were difficult. The ground was swampy, and the trenches quickly became filled knee-deep in water. Montgomery described his army as [...] "half-drowned rats crawling through a swamp". To make matters even worse, food and ammunition supplies were running out, and the British {{showed no sign of}} giving in despite the American bombardment. Disease also worked to reduce the effectiveness of the Americans; by mid-October, more than 900 men had been sent back to Ticonderoga due to illness. In {{the early days of the}} siege, the fort's defenders took advantage of the land they had cleared around the fort to make life as difficult as possible for the besiegers erecting batteries. Major Preston wrote in his journal on September 23 that [...] "a deserter [...] the enemy are erecting their battery and we distress them as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> with shells." [...] Until large guns arrived from Ticonderoga, the fort's defenders enjoyed a significant advantage in firepower.|$|E

Within the month, he fulfilled his contractual obligation to EMI/Capitol for one more album by releasing Shaved Fish, a compilation album of previously recorded tracks. He devoted himself to Sean, rising at 6am daily to plan and prepare his meals and to spend time with him. He wrote [...] "Cookin' (In the Kitchen of Love)" [...] for Starr's Ringo's Rotogravure (1976), performing on the track in June in what would be his last recording session until 1980. He formally announced his break from music in Tokyo in 1977, saying, [...] "we have basically decided, without any great decision, to be with our baby as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> until we feel we can take time off to indulge ourselves in creating things outside of the family." [...] During his career break he created several series of drawings, and drafted a book containing a mix of autobiographical material and what he termed [...] "mad stuff", all of which would be published posthumously.|$|E

In one of many similar statements by his peers reflecting this unique authority, the 17th century scholar Joshua Höschel ben Joseph writes that [...] "from their wells do we drink and should a question arise (on their work), not for this shall we come to annul their words, rather we must study further as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can,</b> {{and if we are}} unable to resolve (our question) then we will ascribe it to our own lack of knowledge and not (as a reason to) annul the words of these geniuses..." ...|$|E
2500|$|We Got It from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service was {{released}} by Epic Records on November 11, 2016, to widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 91, based on 26 reviews; it was the year's best-reviewed hip hop album and fourth best-reviewed album overall, according to the website. Ray Rahman from Entertainment Weekly wrote that the record [...] "vividly demonstrates the group's unassailable greatness and continued relevance", while Christopher R. Weingarten of Rolling Stone believed that [...] "in both delivery and content", A Tribe Called Quest [...] "maintain {{the attitude of the}} Bohemian everydude funkonauts that inspired Kanye West, Andre 3000 and Kendrick Lamar (who all appear here)". Robert Christgau hailed it as a [...] "triumph" [...] in his review for Vice, writing that the record [...] "represents both their bond and the conscious black humanism they felt sure the nation was ready for ... urging us to love each other as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> as we achieve a happiness it's our duty to reaccess if we're to battle as all we can be." [...] In Spin, Brian Josephs praised how the group [...] "worked with the understanding that black music at its finest conversed with ancestry while pointing toward future possibilities in resistance against the racist forces that run parallel." [...] According to Michael Madden from Consequence of Sound, the album exhibits [...] "the classic Tribe sound: a warm and crisp confluence of East Coast hip-hop, jazz, and more, all mixed and mastered impeccably", while Clayton Purdom of The A.V. Club believed the music had more in common with Q-Tip's 2008 solo album The Renaissance than with the group's previous work; he called We got it from Here... "a sinuous sound collage pulling much more from ’90s and ’00s R than it does Native Tongues boom-bap". In The Observer, Kitty Empire wrote that [...] "as the album enters its final third, some focus is lost, but the first two-thirds take no prisoners either lyrically or musically." ...|$|E
