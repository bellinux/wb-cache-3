40|$|ABSTRACT: The role of phenol {{formaldehyde}} or phenolic resin as a binder in friction composites assumes paramount significance because the structural {{integrity of the}} composites depends on it. The resin properties {{as well as its}} content are critical parameters that strongly influence the overall performance of friction composites. In the present paper the influence of alkyl benzene <b>modified</b> <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> on fade and recovery behavior of friction composites is reported and compared with straight phenolic resin. Six non–asbestos friction composites were developed in the laboratory by varying the content of modified resin and unmodified resin viz., 10, 12. 5, and 15 % by weight compensating this variation by inert filler BaSO 4 to keep concentration at 40 %. The concentration of other ingredients was kept constant.

40|$|Offset lithographic {{printing}} plates, until several years ago, used incoherent light sources for image creation in light sensitive coatings. These light sources are {{primarily in the}} ultraviolet light region. Image creation, using an incoherent light source, requires either a film negative or positive and long exposure times. Exposure time {{is dependent on the}} sensitivity of the light sensitive coating and the light intensity. In recent years both equipment and plate suppliers have been working to develop offset {{lithographic printing}} plates which use coherent laser light for image creation. To date all recorded developments have worked on light hardening image creation techniques. At present there has been no recorded effort in developing a thermal curing technique, using a coherent infrared laser beam, for image creation. The infrared laser light would be used to thermal-harden image areas only and leave non-image areas soft or unexposed. After exposure, non-image areas would be removed with a developing solvent. This thesis was conducted to determine if image creation would be possible based on thermal curing of a <b>modified</b> <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin.</b> Ten experiments were conducted to determine the image creation requirements of different coating formulations and various exposure conditions. Several coating formulations were used to determine the optimum coating for thermal curing using a carbon dioxide infrared laser. Exposure time, exposure speed and light intensity (laser output power) were varied to determine the effect each has on thermal -hardening of the <b>modified</b> <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> coating. Experimental results supported the theory that images could be created in a <b>modified</b> <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> coating. Both halftone dots and solids could be created in the coating. Solids required much less energy than halftone dots. It is believed that {{this is due to the}} poor infrared absorption of the coating. Solids received much longer exposure time than halftone dots. This longer exposure time enables the coating to absorb more infrared light. Further studies of the thermal response of the <b>modified</b> <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> coating could make the plate a useable product in the future. It is believed that the phenolic resin coating could become a useable method of image creation with further modifications. Infrared absorption of the coating must be increased to enable images to be created at higher exposure speeds and shorter exposure times. Other exposure techniques could also be investigated to reduce the amount of energy required to thermal-harden the coating...|$|E

The main problem of blending UP and PH resin is their incompatibility due to their different curing mechanisms, {{which can lead to}} phase separation and hence, poor mechanical properties of the composite produced. In order to make them compatible, functionalised/modified resins have been used. In this PhD work, co-blending of UP with following resins have been studied: a) unfunctionalised/functionalised resole phenolic resins (Res-PH) : four resins chosen were water-based resole (PH 1), ethanol-soluble (PH 2), epoxy-functionalised (PH 3), and allyl-functionalised (PH 4); b) flame retardants (resorcinol bis (diphenyl phosphate (RDP), bisphenol-A bisdiphenyl phosphate (BADP) and 9, 10 -dihydro- 9 -oxa- 10 -phosphaphenanthrene- 10 -oxide (DOPO)) added to Res-PH resins; c) modified novolac phenolic: methacrylated novolac (M-Nov) resin; and d) melamine formaldehyde resin (MF). The curing behaviour and compatibility of UP, other resins and their blends have been studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). These results showed that the blends of UP with the functionalised phenolic resins are chemically compatible and can be co-cured. Based on the successful establishment of curing conditions, plaques of resins have been cast and cured. The most compatible polymer blend systems (UP with functionalised/ <b>modified</b> <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin)</b> such as UP/PH 4 and UP/M-Nov systems showed DMTA results with single glass transition temperature (Tg) and no phase separation in the scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images, while incompatible systems showed signs of phase separation. Limiting oxygen index (LOI) measurements and cone calorimetry at 50 kW/m 2 heat flux have shown that fire performance of the functionalised Res-PH resins and their blends with UP is inferior than that from the un-functionalised Res-PH resin, but still significantly better than that of the UP. The blended resins with added FRs showed the similar trend i. e., FRs are, least effective in un-functionalised (UP/PH 2 blends) blends compared with functionalised blends (UP/PH 3 and UP/PH 4). To understand this behaviour, thermal analyses using thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with infrared spectroscopy of volatile degradation products have been used on all resins and their blends, based on which, mechanisms of their decomposition and interactions are proposed, and the effects of these on flammability are discussed. UP/inherently flame retardant resin blends show improved thermal stability and improved flame retardancy than that of UP due to the char formation of inherently flame retardant resin component of the bend, whereas the UP resin decomposes into combustible volatiles, which burn. The glass fibre-reinforced composites (GFRCs) from co-blended matrices were prepared by hand lay-up method. The flammability of the composite samples was assessed by means of cone calorimetry and UP- 94 tests. The GFRCs from co-blended resins showed better flame retardancy in terms of significant reductions in peak heat release rate (PHRR) and improved char residue. Finally the mechanical properties of the composite laminates have been studied by flexural, impact and tensile tests. The GFRCs from blends of UP with non-functionalised phenolic (UP/PH 2) with and without FRs showed poor mechanical properties due to poor compatibility between UP and PH 2, whereas, the GFRC from UP with functionalised phenolic resin, PH 3 -epoxy functionalised, PH 4 -allyl functionalised with and without FRs and UP/M-Nov, showed little deterioration in mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} a study of two-step plywood adhesives made with varying amounts of phenol, 1, 3, 5 xylenol, resorcin, and formaldehyde. Each resin was evaluated by using it as the adhesive in making plywood. The plywood was then tested for shear strength and wood failure after a four hour boil. Procedures are given for making and testing various straight <b>phenolic</b> <b>resins</b> and <b>resins</b> <b>modified</b> with 1, 3, 5 xylenol or resorcin, or comibinations of both of these accelerating <b>resins.</b> The straight <b>phenolic</b> <b>resins</b> gave boil-proof bonds, but the curing cycle was too long. Those <b>phenolics</b> <b>modified</b> with 1, 3, 5 xylenol gave relatively short cures, but large quantities of this modifier were necessary. Modification of <b>phenolic</b> <b>resins</b> with resorcin gave very rapid cures, but the pot life of these resins was too short. The best compromise was obtained {{with a combination of}} 1, 3, 5 xylenol and resorcin as modifying agents for the phenolic. Some of these three-component resin adhesives had sufficient pot life and produced boil-proof bonds during short curing cycles...|$|R
30|$|The {{search for}} new {{value-added}} uses for oilseed and animal proteins led us to develop protein-based wood adhesives. Low-fat soy and peanut flours and blood meal were hydrolyzed in an alkaline state, and PF-cross-linked protein resins were formulated by reacting the protein hydrolyzates with phenol-formaldehyde (PF) in solid-tosolid ratios ranging from 70 % to 50 % hydrolyzates and 30 % to 50 % PF. Physical properties of medium density fiberboard (MDF) bonded with protein-based <b>phenolic</b> <b>resins</b> were compared to those of boards bonded with ureaformaldehyde (UF) and PF resins, and flakeboard bonded with soy protein-based <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> was compared to PF-bonded board. As MDF binders, adhesive properties of protein-based <b>phenolic</b> <b>resins</b> depended upon protein content of proteinacious materials. MDF board bonded with blood-based <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> was comparable to PF-bonded board and met the requirements for exterior MDF. Boards bonded with soy-protein-based <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> met requirements for interior MDF, while peanut-based phenolic failed to {{meet some of the}} requirements. Flakeboard bonded with soy-protein-based <b>phenolic</b> <b>resins</b> was inferior to PF-bonded board but outperformed PF-bonded board in accelerated aging tests. Although they exhibit a slow curing rate, the cost effectiveness and superior dimensional stability of protein-based <b>phenolic</b> <b>resins</b> may make them attractive for some uses.|$|R
40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} {{behavior of}} <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> was investigated {{to verify the}} relation between the properties of porous ceramics with ZrO 2 -C system for submerged entry nozzle and the characteristics of <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> with various relative humidity. The green and the sintered density were decreased between 25 % and 50 % relative humidity, whereas they were gradually enhanced above 50 % relative humidity. The highest value of apparent porosity was 20. 1 % and the minimum compressive strength was 69 MPa in the specimen using the powder exposed to 50 % relative humidity. As a result of thermal analysis for <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin,</b> the shift of endothermic peak to low temperature and the reduction of exothermic peak were observed, and the peaks corresponded to melting and curing of <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin,</b> respectively. The melting and the curing of <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> generate the change of green density, and it can affect the propertie...|$|R
