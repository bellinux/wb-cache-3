5|$|Modern English syntax {{language}} is moderately analytic. It has developed {{features such as}} <b>modal</b> verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning. Auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the passive voice and progressive aspect.|$|E
30|$|Thus, I take 16 and 17 as {{the basis}} and propose that hai and <b>modals</b> can be linearized as follows. First, the {{additive}} hai, which can be an adjunct of MPEpi, IP, or AspP, may occur either before or after epistemic <b>modals,</b> but should precede deontic and dynamic <b>modals,</b> as in 18. Second, the temporal hai, which adjoins to AspP, occurs between epistemic <b>modals</b> and deontic <b>modals,</b> as in 19. Third, the comparative hai and the marginal hai, which are DegP adjuncts, occur between deontic <b>modals</b> and dynamic <b>modals,</b> as in 20 – 21, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Universal deontic <b>modals</b> {{may vary}} {{with respect to}} whether they scope over or under negation. For instance, English <b>modals</b> like must and should take wide scope with respect to negation; <b>modals</b> like have to and need to take narrow scope. Similar {{patterns}} have been attested in other languages. In this article, we argue that the scopal properties of <b>modals</b> with respect to negation can be understood if (a) <b>modals</b> that outscope negation are positive polarity items (PPIs); (b) all <b>modals</b> originate in a position lower than I[superscript 0]; and (c) <b>modals</b> undergo reconstruction unless reconstruction leads to a PPI-licensing violation...|$|R
40|$|This paper motivates and {{develops}} a novel semantic framework for deontic <b>modals.</b> The framework {{is designed to}} shed light on two things: the relationship between deontic <b>modals</b> and substantive theories of practical rationality and the interaction of deontic <b>modals</b> with conditionals, epistemic <b>modals</b> and probability operators. I argue that, in order to model inferential connections between deontic <b>modals</b> and probability operators, we need more structure than is provided by classical intensional theories. In particular, we need probabilistic structure that interacts directly with the compositional semantics of deontic <b>modals.</b> However, I reject theories that provide this probabilistic structure by claiming that the semantics of deontic <b>modals</b> is linked to the Bayesian notion of expectation. I offer a probabilistic premise semantics that explains all the data that create trouble for the rival theories...|$|R

30|$|My {{analysis}} goes as follows. The doxastic {{component in}} the semantics of counterfactual attitudes provides an information state that epistemic <b>modals</b> can be anaphoric to, thereby licensing epistemic modals; however, their counterfactual component filters out epistemic possibility <b>modals</b> since the resulting existential quantification over the information state via semantic composition of the <b>modals</b> and the embedding attitude implies that the domain of quantification is not totally excluded from the set of common ground worlds. This leads to violation of the felicity condition. Therefore, epistemic possibility <b>modals</b> cannot be licensed in this attitudinal context.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that both <b>modals</b> and tense {{expressions}} are anaphoric, and can be handled by the same discourse mechanisms underlying the resolution of pronouns and other anaphoric devices.

We explain this by assuming all anaphors, including tense and <b>modals,</b> can access dynamic discourse referents. By treating sloppy identity as a general feature of the resolution of anaphoric devices in discourse, we give a simple, unified treatment of the sloppy identity patterns observed with tense and <b>modals...</b>|$|R
25|$|Since {{interior}} algebras are (normal) Boolean algebras with operators, {{they can}} be represented by fields of sets on appropriate relational structures. In particular, since they are <b>modal</b> algebras, {{they can be}} represented as fields of sets on a set with a single binary relation, called a <b>modal</b> frame. The <b>modal</b> frames corresponding to interior algebras are precisely the preordered sets. Preordered sets (also called S4-frames) provide the Kripke semantics of the <b>modal</b> logic S4, and the connection between interior algebras and preorders is deeply related to their connection with <b>modal</b> logic.|$|E

25|$|<b>Modal</b> logics include {{additional}} <b>modal</b> operators, such as {{an operator}} which states that a particular formula is not only true, but necessarily true.

50|$|The {{origin of}} {{multiple}} <b>modals</b> is controversial. Some {{say it is}} a development of Modern English, others found out that double <b>modals</b> already existed in Middle English and again others suggest that it derives from Scots-Irish settlers.|$|R
30|$|The {{temperature}} monitoring point with greater {{contributions to the}} overall temperature entropy possesses the higher weight.

The stable <b>modals</b> slightly influence the orderly variation of the dam temperature.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a corpus-based analysis {{of variation in}} the distribution and function of <b>modals</b> and {{their role in the}} expression of “stance ” in a corpus of 600 research articles (RAs) across twelve disciplines. Stance is an expression of attitudes, judgments, or assessments towards the truth of propositions (Biber et al., 1999), and part of the important function of claiming and confirming membership of discourse communities and therefore in constructing identity. Three functional categories of <b>modals</b> perform a valuable role in the construction of stance: Possibility/Ability, Obligation/Necessity, and Prediction (Biber et al., 1999). However, very little research seems to have investigated variation across disciplines or their use in the RA. The corpus was analysed using WordSmith Tools (Scott, 2004), followed by manual checking of the function of every occurrence. Inter- and intra-rater agreement was also checked. Many statistically significant disciplinary differences were found, along with numerous marked differences with individual <b>modals.</b> Further examination of the corpus revealed considerable disciplinary variation in the patterns and verbs associated with the target <b>modals,</b> and a number of sub-functions of the topics covered by the <b>modals.</b> Conclusions are that <b>modals</b> perform {{an important role in the}} construction of stance...|$|R
25|$|A {{performance}} of the Ballets Africains from Guinea, in 1958, had originally sparked Davis' interest in <b>modal</b> music. This music stayed {{for long periods of}} time on a single chord, weaving in and out of consonance and dissonance. Another influence was George Russell's treatise. Both influences coalesced in Davis' conception of <b>modal</b> jazz offering an alternative to chord changes and major/minor key relationships, relying instead on a series of <b>modal</b> scales. He realized that Evans, who had worked with Russell, could follow him into <b>modal</b> music. At the same time, Evans introduced Davis to European classical music.|$|E
