40|$|Aims. To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} partial replacement of a high-fat diet with <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil</b> on diabetic neuropathy in an animal model of type 2 diabetes. Materials and Methods. High-fat/low-dose streptozotocin diabetic rats were used to examine the influence of replacing 50 % of the source of the high-fat diet (lard) with <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil,</b> a natural source of n- 3 fatty acids, on diabetic neuropathy. Endpoints included analyses of glucose tolerance, fatty liver disease, serum and liver fatty acid composition, serum lipid and adiponectin levels, motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity and innervation of the hindpaw. Results. Diabetic rats were insulin resistant and <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil</b> did not improve whole animal glucose utilization. <b>Menhaden</b> <b>oil</b> did not improve elevated HbA 1 C levels or serum lipid levels but serum levels of adiponectin were significantly increased and hepatic steatosis was significantly improved. Diabetic rats were thermal hypoalgesic, had reduced motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities and intraepidermal nerve fiber profiles were decreased in the hindpaw and these endpoints were significantly improved with <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil.</b> Conclusions.

In {{this study}} a {{streptozotocin}} induced {{type 1 diabetes}} mouse model {{was used to assess}} the effectiveness of salsalate, <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil,</b> the combination of salsalate and <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil,</b> or resolvin D 1 on neuropathic endpoints. Materials and Methods. Changes in body weight, blood glucose, serum markers for triglycerides, free fatty acids, cholesterol, and resolvin D 1, motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities and thermal sensitivity were assessed, as well as performing in vivo confocal microscopy of subepithelial corneal nerves and immunohistochemistry of nerves in the cornea and foot pad. Results. Diabetic animals failed to gain weight and had elevated blood glucose levels. Diabetic mice had slowed nerve conduction velocity, reduced innervation of the foot pad and cornea subepithelial and epithelial layers, and reduced thermal sensitivity. Monotherapy treatment with salsalate, <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil,</b> and resolvin D 1 reduced the pathological signs of diabetic neuropathy. The combination of salsalate and <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil</b> also reduced signs of pathology and generated elevated plasma levels of resolvin D 1 compared to other groups. Conclusions.

Chicken feed containing <b>menhaden</b> fish <b>oil</b> can affect digestion, metabolism and production of meat and egg. The research aimed to evaluate lipid biosynthesis on blood and egg yolk of local chicken fed with feed containing <b>menhaden</b> fish <b>oil</b> as an omega- 3 source. The research used 60 hens placed in individual battery cages with four treatments and five repetitions.

Data analysis used analysis of variance continued with Duncan’s test. The result of the researh showed that the treatments did not signifcantly affect lipid consumption, blood lipid content, blood and yolk cholesterols. However, the treatment significantly affected yolk lipid. The used of <b>menhaden</b> fish <b>oil</b> in feed as an omega- 3 source was accumulated in yolk eggs as followed: C 18 : 3 from 0. 17 % (R 0) to 0. 29 % (R 2); DHA (C 22 : 6) from 0. 87 % (R 0) to 3. 12 % (R 3); EPA C 18 : 2 from 1. 05 % (R 0) to 1. 85 % (R 2); EPA C 22 : 4 from 0. 77 % (R 0) to 0. 88 % (R 2) respectively.

40|$|Feeds that {{maximize}} {{reproductive potential}} {{are needed to}} ensure success of captive broodstock. Nutritional requirements for somatic growth of juvenile fishes differ from nutritional requirements of mature fishes and are largely species-specific. Broodstock nutritional research has focused primarily on lipid and fatty acid requirements and their effects on reproductive conditioning due {{to the importance of}} these nutrients in providing metabolic energy and structural elements, i. e. for phospholipids for embryonic development. Development of suitable broodstock feeds are limited by not knowing fatty acid requirements for many species. Once requirements are identified, plant, grain, marine, algal, and fungal lipid sources can be blended to develop least-cost diet formulations. The objectives of this dissertation are to (1) evaluate white bass Morone chrysops ovum fatty acid composition and reproductive performance after feeding maternal broodstock graded levels of squid to fish oil; (2) evaluate flax, canola, and corn oils as alternatives to marine oil(s) in white bass maternal broodstock diets; (3) determine extent to which grain oils can replace marine oils in female white bass broodstock diets in order to maintain reproductive performance and quantify fatty acid utilization of larvae with different initial fatty acid profiles; and (4) assess dietary supplementation of 20 : 4 n- 6, 20 : 5 n- 3, and 22 : 6 n- 3 concentrates to boost reproductive performance of female white bass fed primarily plant oil-based lipid sources. Of the marine and plant <b>oils</b> tested, <b>menhaden</b> fish <b>oil</b> provided female white bass broodstock the fatty acids (~ 3. 9 % n- 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids; LC-PUFA; dry matter basis) necessary to maximize embryonic survival; however, flax oil, due to its low 18 : 2 n- 6 and high 18 : 3 n- 3 content, showed promise as a suitable plant oil candidate for partial if not complete marine oil substitution in female white bass broodstock feeds. Differential responses in embryonic and larval survival resulted in comparable total larval yields at 5 days post hatch (DPH) after feeding female broodstock graded levels (0, 33, 67, or 100 %) flax to fish oils for 30 weeks prior to spawning. At the end of the endogenous feeding period, fatty acid compositions of flax and fish oil-fed broodstock progeny deviated from initial ova composition. Although n- 3 LC-PUFA from <b>menhaden</b> fish <b>oil</b> are essential for embryonic survival, sunshine bass appear to have lower n- 3 LC-PUFA requirements after hatch. Larval survival was highly dependent on the presence of C 18 PUFA present due to flax oil inclusion in maternal diets. Embryonic survival of progeny produced from broodstock fed dietary saturated fatty acid-rich plant lipids supplemented with intact LC-PUFA concentrates (~ 3. 4 % n- 3 LC-PUFA; dry matter basis) was {{similar to that of the}} broodstock fed the <b>menhaden</b> fish <b>oil</b> control diet containing 4. 8 % n- 3 LC-PUFA.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The lipid {{composition}} of swine {{is characteristic of}} the species and is also a reflection of their dietary history. Other investigators have established that the physical properties and {{composition of}} swine depot fat may be altered by variation of the dietary lipid. Dietary regimens employing vegetable oil-bearing materials and their effect on meat quality has received the attention of animal nutritionists for a considerable period. Less {{is known about the}} nutritive value of the more highly unsaturated lipids, such as fish oils, and their effect on the lipid composition of swine tissues. Even less is known about the fate of oxidized fish oil lipids in swine rations. This research had for its purpose the investigation of the fate in swine of the dietary marine lipid, <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil,</b> and its effect on composition of depot lipids. The state of autoxidation of the oil and the effect of certain antioxidants on the fatty acid composition of swine was determined. Growth studies on swine were made using <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil</b> of various oxidation states as the dietary lipid. The effect of antioxidants, ∝-tocopherol acetate and ethoxyquin, was also investigated. At the conclusion of the diet trials, tissue samples, representing the five dietary regimens, were removed for analysis. The fatty tissues examined were outer back fat, inner back fat, and kidney fat. Samples of liver tissue for lipid analysis were also taken. The lipids from the respective tissues were extracted and interesterified with methanol to yield the methyl esters of the fatty acids. Hydrogenation of the unsaturated methyl esters for chain length confirmation was carried out. Qualitative and quantitative gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of the unhydrogenated and hydrogenated methyl esters of the fatty acids were performed on diethylene glycol succinate column. The results of these investigations showed that a particular dietary fatty acid can be selectively deposited in animal tissues. Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids of <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil,</b> such as 20 : 5, 22 : 5, 22 : 6 were sparsely deposited in adipose tissues. The depot fat composition showed a mixture of characteristic <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil</b> fatty acids with the typical fat synthesized by swine. Fatty acid composition of tissue from swine fed oxidized <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil</b> with and without antioxidants showed very similar fatty acid composition as those fed fresh <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil.</b> The results of this investigation supported the beneficial effect of vitamin E (∝-tocopherol acetate) and ethoxyquin as in vivo antioxidants...|$|E

Our previous results {{have shown that}} fatty acid synthesis is considerably increased by high carbohydrates-fat free diet (HCFF) given to rats after fasting, and leads to lipid accumulation and morphological alterations in the liver, defined as steatosis. As n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are able to counteract lipogenesis induction in vivo and in vitro, we hypothesized that the addition of <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil</b> in a carbohydrate-rich diet {{might be able to}} protect the liver against steatosis induced by a fasting-re-feeding transition. Male Wistar rats were first fasted for 48 hr, then re-fed ad lib. for 24 hr with either (1) standard diet; (2) high carbohydrates-fat free diet (HCFF), containing 40 % (w/w) starch, 40 % saccharose, 16 % casein and 4 % vitamin mineral mix; or (3) the latter diet containing additionally 5 % <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil</b> (HCMO) for 24 hr. Triglyceride (TG) accumulation occurred in liver tissue of rats re-fed with HCFF and HCMO diets after fasting. The addition of <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil</b> led to a strong decrease in serum TG; however, both TG and phospholipid (PL) levels, as well as fatty acid synthase activity, were increased in the liver of HCMO rats as compared with the values obtained in HCFF re-fed rats.

To date, the available methods to monitor lipid oxidation in foods are based on chemical analysis. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is an alternative technique for the study of molecular structure and compo-sitional changes {{in a wide range of}} foods. The objectives of this study were to use attenuated total reflectance-FTIR for evaluating oxidative quality and application of artificial neural network analysis (ANN), a mathematical model, to predict the oxidative values of <b>Menhaden</b> fish <b>oil.</b> The oil was stored in the presence of light at room temperature. The oxidation was measured for primary and secondary oxida-tive change; peroxide value (PV) and anisidine value (AnV), respectively, using FTIR were compared with chemical analysis each day during the 3 weeks of storage. The wavenumber and absorbance values of FTIR spectra were applied to predict the oxidative values of the oil by using ANN. Inputs consisted of wavenumber and absor-bance outputs were composed of PV and AnV. It was found that changes in the region between 3, 500 and 1, 700 cm- 1 and absorbance were related to PV and AnVof the chemical analysis (R 2 > 0. 85). FTIR spectroscopy with the aid of ANN demonstrates its potential as an alternative and rapid technique rather than a conventional method for prediction of food lipids oxidation.

40|$|Lipids such as omega- 3 {{fatty acids}} and citrus oils are {{important}} food components {{due to their}} nutritional and flavor benefits, respectively. Both of these food lipids are susceptible to chemical degradation resulting in formation of unacceptable off-flavors, nutrient and flavor loss. Oil-in-water emulsions {{could be used as}} an effective tool to protect these chemically sensitive lipids from deterioration by engineering the emulsion droplet interfacial membrane (e. g. charge and/or thickness) using proteins or multiple layers of emulsifiers. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effectiveness of the interfacial characteristics of emulsions stabilized with proteins or multiple layers of emulsifiers in preventing oxidative deterioration of omega- 3 fatty acids and citrus oil flavor compounds. ^ Factors influencing the stability of protein-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions at pH 3. 0 were examined. Physical instability of whey protein isolate (WPI) -stabilized corn oil-in-water emulsions increased considerably after thermal processing at ≥ 70 °C in the presence of ≥ 150 mM NaCl. WPI-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions containing 25 wt% algal or <b>menhaden</b> <b>oils</b> at pH 3. 0 had good oxidative stability when pasteurized and stored at 4 °C. The addition of EDTA and mixed tocopherol isomers further increased oxidative stability. These results suggest that WPI-stabilized algal or menhaden oil-in-water emulsions at pH 3. 0 containing EDTA may be used as an ingredient delivery system to incorporate ω- 3 fatty acids into functional foods. ^ Citral/hexadecane- or limonene/hexadecane-in-water emulsions were prepared with varying interfacial properties by coating the oil droplets with WPI, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), SDS-chitosan or gum arabic (GA). Emulsifier type had little influence on the rate of citral degradation. However, WPI and SDS-chitosan were more effective at retarding the oxidation of citral degradation products and limonene in comparison to emulsions stabilized by GA. Inhibition of oxidation by the WPI or SDS-chitosan systems could be due to the ability of these emulsifiers to produce cationic emulsion droplet interfacial membranes that inhibit the interactions between dispersed lipids and continuous phase prooxidants such as iron. This research may lead to development of new strategies to improve the stability of emulsified products containing citrus oils. ...|$|R

The dietary protein treatments used in this study had no effect on growth and survival of the juvenile sea urchins. The lipid source treatments, which differed in the major essential fatty acids (i. e., n- 3 and/or n- 6), also had no effect on juvenile growth and survival in this study, but juveniles fed diets with lower lipid concentrations (i. e., 1 % and 3 %) had larger test sizes, but similar survival, than those fed diets with a high lipid concentration (i. e., 10 %). The poor growth and physical appearance of the juveniles fed the protein and lipid diets were attributed to nutrient deficiencies in the prepared diets and the associated stress in the juveniles. Juveniles fed pigmented diets grew to a larger size than those fed non-pigmented diets. Similarly, dietary mineral concentration had a positive effect on juvenile test growth. Juveniles (1 - 2 mm initial TD) fed a pigmented diet with high mineral concentration (15 %) grew to a larger size than kelp-fed juveniles. The data indicate there were no differences in the nutritional needs of the various sizes of juvenile green sea urchins used in this study. Hence, nutritionally balanced prepared diets can be used for a wide size range of green sea urchins to increase juvenile test growth while maintaining health and survival...|$|R

The laying hens were fed for 6 wk with a wheat-soybean meal basal diet with added sunflower oil (SO), animal oil (AO), linseed <b>oil</b> (LO), or <b>menhaden</b> fish <b>oil</b> (FO) at 5 % (wt/wt). Upon hatching, the chicks (30 /group) were given {{the same types of}} diets for 8 wk. The dietary SO, AO, and LO provided different n- 6 to n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratios. The FO and LO had ratios of n- 6 to n- 3 PUFA that were close but had different components of n- 3 PUFA. The results demonstrated that the chicks fed LO or FO had significantly lower (P 0. 05) in spleen.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Normal {{intestinal}} bacteria can initiate systemic disease by translocating {{out of the}} intestinal lumen to extrain-testinal sites such as the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), liver, and spleen. To determine whether dietary essential fatty acids can affect the incidence of bacterial translocation, separate groups of mice were fed one of two diets for 8 days: an essential fatty acid-replete diet (EFA-R) containing a basal formula supplemented with arginine, yeast RNA, <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil,</b> and safflower oil, or an essential fatty acid-deficient diet (EFA-D) containing the same ingredients with the safflower oil replaced by <b>menhaden</b> <b>oil.</b> Mice were given either diet alone, diet plus 50 &mu;g of intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or diet plus 3 days of 4 mg of intramuscular metronidazole (MET) three times a day.

Using 32 P-postlabeling assays, IQ-DNA adducts were isolated and quantitated in the liver, small intestine, and large intestine. Adduct patterns were similar in all cases. Adduct levels, expressed as relative adduct labeling values (RAL x 10 (7)), were related to dose in all three tissues, with liver levels up to 10 -fold higher than the large intestine and up to 20 -fold higher than the small intestine.

In an attempt to better understand how varying levels of dietary n- 3 fatty acids affected enrichment of plasma lipid subfractions, the current study was undertaken. Adult dogs were fed one of two basal diets with the addition of beef tallow, safflower oil, linseed <b>oil,</b> or <b>menhaden</b> fish <b>oil</b> at 18. 0 g/ 100 g diet or beef tallow or safflower oil at 5. 65 g/ 100 g diet. Plasma was collected on the day oil supplementation began (day 0) and on the day oil supplementation concluded (day 28). No change in plasma total cholesterol or triacylglycerol was observed on day 28. Plasma free cholesterol was depressed in all groups suggesting plasma cholesterol esterification. However, plasma esterified cholesterol was significantly decreased on day 28 in the group supplemented with <b>menhaden</b> fish <b>oil.</b> This finding {{may be due to the}} fact that n- 3 highly unsaturated fatty acids II-IUFAI act as poor substrates for the lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase reaction. Plasma triacylglycerol (TG) and phospholipid (PL) fatty acid compositions reflected dietary fatty acids. When actual plasma PL and TG fatty acids were compared with values predicted by the Lands' equations, some modifications of constants were necessary to achieve an equation that better predicted values for the percent n- 6 HUFA in PL. However, n- 3 HUFA was not accurately predicted, and studies delineating more precisely the competitive effects of n- 3 fatty acids on lipid metabolism will permit further modification of the hyperbolic PL equation. After minor adjustments to Lands' linear equations that predict linoleum acid (LA) and linolenic acid (ALA) in plasma TG, algebraic equations with improved ability to estimate LA and ALA in plasma TG resulted. Fatty acid profiles of plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC) reflected oil supplementation. However, n- 3 FIUFA were not incorporated into cholesterol ester (CE) at the same proportion as found in the PC fraction. While the PC fraction did contain docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), it was not significantly present in plasma CE. These findings are consistent with the possibility that DPA is transported only on plasma TG and PL lipoprotein lipid subfractions and that this transport is unidirectional...|$|R

Vascular reactivity of isolated aortic strips from rats maintained for 3 weeks on a control diet or on a diet supplemented with <b>menhaden</b> fish <b>oil</b> (17 % EPA) was examined with norepinephrine, sodium arachidonate, KCl, PGF 2 [alpha] and nitroprusside.

Treatment of aortic strips with indomethacin decreased responsiveness to norepinephrine. The magnitude of the decrease was greater in control rats resulting in a similar vascular response between the 2 groups after blockade. Contractions to arachidonate were abolished by indomethacin. There were no differences in vascular responses to KCl, PGF 2 [alpha] and nitroprusside in aortic strips from control diet rats and those from the fish oil diet rats. Aortic strips from the fish oil diet rats contained more EPA than those from the control diet rats.

40|$|Background. A high {{intake of}} omega- 3 {{polyunsaturated}} fatty acids (n- 3 PUFAs) in mice causes impaired host resistance to Listeria monocytogenes. We wished {{to determine the}} role of interferon (IFN) –g signaling in this increased disease susceptibility. Methods. A feeding trial was conducted with mice unable to produce IFN-g (IFN-gKO); we provided ex-ogenous recombinant IFN-g during L. monocytogenes challenge. The experimental diets were nutritionally complete and differed only in fat source: lard (devoid of n- 3 PUFAs) or <b>menhaden</b> fish <b>oil</b> (rich in n- 3 PUFAs). Results. The administration of IFN-g significantly enhanced bacterial clearance in IFN-gKO mice fed a diet devoid of n- 3 PUFAs but had no effect in mice fed a diet rich in n- 3 PUFAs. Ex vivo analysis of immune cells showed that n- 3 PUFAs did not affect IFN-g receptor expression on immune cells. However, on IFN-g treatment, the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 was significantly reduced in peritoneal macrophages isolated from mice fed n- 3 PUFAs. Conclusions. These data suggest that diminished IFN-g signaling in murine macrophages is one mechanism by which n- 3 PUFAs impair host resistance to L. monocytogenes. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report of a nutrient affecting IFN-g signaling and in vivo responsiveness to this cytokine. Fish oils, which are rich in omega- 3 polyunsaturate...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHere we {{test whether}} the {{incorporation}} of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22 : 6), an (n − 3) fatty acid, into lymphocyte membranes affects {{the expression of the}} surface proteins Thy- 1. 2 and CD 8. DHA was incorporated into splenocytes by three methods: feeding mice diets containing <b>menhaden</b> (fish) <b>oil,</b> fusing splenocytes with DHA-containing phosphatidylcholine vesicles, and culturing splenocytes with DHA. Thy- 1. 2 and CD 8 expression were measured by flow cytometry and complement-mediated lysis using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. As (n − 3) fatty acid incorporation into the lymphocytes increased, the expression of one Thy- 1. 2 epitope and one CD 8 epitope decreased; the expression of two CD 8 epitopes increased. Although diet-induced changes in surface protein expression may result from selective migration of cell populations or the diet's effect on protein biosynthesis, fusion with lipid vesicles demonstrated that DHA-containing phospholipids can mediate a direct and immediate effect. The decrease in Thy- 1. 2 expression was sustained {{for more than a week}} after removal of (n − 3) fatty acids from the diet, most likely due to retention of membrane-bound (n − 3) fatty acids. Because Thy- 1. 2 and CD 8 participate in T cell activation, modulation of their expression by DHA suggests that DHA, when serving as a membrane structural element, may alter immune function...|$|R
