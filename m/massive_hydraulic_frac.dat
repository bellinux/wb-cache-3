50|$|<b>Massive</b> <b>hydraulic</b> {{fracturing}} of gas {{wells in}} tight sandstone began in Germany in 1975, and became common {{during the period}} 1978-1985, when more wells received <b>massive</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fracs</b> in Germany {{than in any other}} European country. Germany also had the largest hydraulic fracturing jobs in Europe, using up to 650 tonnes of proppant per well. Most German fracs used water- or oil-based gels. The most popular target formation for hydraulic fracturing was the Rotliegend Sandstone. Hydraulically fractured wells are today the source of most of German natural gas production.|$|R

Pan American Petroleum applied the first <b>massive</b> <b>hydraulic</b> fracturing (also known as high-volume hydraulic fracturing) treatment in the non-communist world to a well in Stephens County, Oklahoma in 1968.

40|$|Pre- and post-fracturing well {{tests in}} TG- 2 well drilled {{next to the}} Matsukawa field are {{interpreted}} for evaluating effects of a <b>massive</b> <b>hydraulic</b> fracturing treatment. The interpreted data include multiple-step rate tests, a two-step rate test, and falloff tests. Pressure behaviors of <b>massive</b> <b>hydraulic</b> fracturing are matched by a simulator of dynamic fracture option. Fracture parting pressures can be evaluated from the multiple-step rate test data. The multiple-step rates during the <b>massive</b> <b>hydraulic</b> fracturing treatment show that multiple fractures have been induced in sequence. Although the pre-fracturing falloff tests are too short, fracture propagation can be evaluated qualitatively from the falloff data. Interpretation of the falloff test immediately after the MHF suggests that extensive fractures have been created by the MHF, which is verified by simulation. The post-fracturing falloff tests show that the fractures created by the MHF have closed to a great degree...|$|R
