25|$|Coke {{is a solid}} {{carbonaceous}} residue derived from coking coal (a low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal, also known as metallurgical coal), which is used in manufacturing steel and other iron products. Coke is made from coking coal by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as 1,000°C (1,832°F), driving off the volatile constituents and fusing together the fixed carbon and residual ash. <b>Metallurgical</b> <b>coke</b> {{is used as a}} fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace.

The microstrength of cokes was significantly degraded in the process of heat treatment. The microstrength of the RMDC was lower, and of its deterioration caused by heat treatment was more severe than IMDC. The degradation of the microstrength of cokes was attributed to their increased graphitisation degree during the heat treatment. © 2013 The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International...|$|R

40|$|Of all coke {{properties}} {{the influence}} of the catalytic mineral matter on reactivity of <b>metallurgical</b> <b>cokes</b> is least understood. There is limited information about the form of minerals in the <b>metallurgical</b> <b>cokes</b> and no information about their relative concentration. A comprehensive study was undertaken for characterisation of mineral matter in coke (qualitative and quantitative), which enabled quantification of the effect of catalytic minerals on the reaction rate, and establishment of the effect of gasification on the mineral phases. Also, the relative importance of coke properties on the gasification reaction rate was determined. The reactivity experiments were performed at approximately 900 ºC using 100 % CO 2 under chemically controlled conditions. The mineralogical composition of the investigated cokes was found to vary greatly as did the levels of catalytic mineral phases. These were identified to be metallic iron, iron sulfides and iron oxides. The gasification reaction rate at the initial stages was strongly influenced by the content of catalytic mineral phases and also by the particle size of the catalytic mineral matter. The reaction rate increased as the contact surface between catalyst and carbon matrix increased. Catalytic mineral phases showed a strong influence on the reaction rate at early stages of reaction. But their influence diminished during gasification. At later stages of reaction {{the influence of}} micropore surface area became more important. The influence of the catalytic mineral phases diminished during gasification because the catalyst was inactivated to some degree and the contact surface between the catalyst and carbon matrix diminished due to the strong gasification of the carbon around the catalyst particles. The partial inactivation of the catalytic mineral phases occurred because metallic iron and pyrrhotite were oxidised by CO 2 to iron oxide, and in turn iron oxide reacted with other mineral phases, which it is associated with, to form minerals that are not catalysts. It is noteworthy that a significant percentage of the mineral matter present in the investigated cokes was amorphous (44 - 75 %). The iron, potassium and sodium present in the amorphous phase did not appear to catalyse gasification, but their potential contribution to gasification could not be completely excluded...|$|R

Pore structure of cokes was examined using image analysis. Porosity and pore size were both enlarged under gasification and annealing conditions. The pore structure change during gasification was mainly {{a result of the}} Boudouard reaction; the pore structure development upon annealing was attributed to the reactions of mineral matters with carbon and further devolatilization. Annealing and gasification caused a decrease in average pore roundness, an increase in the fraction of low roundness pores and the increase of coalescence points in the pore area. The degradation of coke strength following reaction and annealing was characterized using tensile testing. Both gasification and annealing decreased the mechanical strength of coke. Degradation of more reactive cokes (cokes C and D) by gasification at 1673 K (1400 °C) was visibly stronger in comparison with annealing at the same temperature. Increasing the amount of coalescence points and the degradation of coke microstrength during annealing and gasification were major factors in the degradation of cokes under the simulated blast furnace conditions...|$|R

By contrast, other variants of the Bergius process require the use of 15 pounds or more of hydrogen per barrel, resulting in an inherent materials cost. Second, the conventional Bergius process requires high pressure, in the range of 1500 psig to 3000 psig. The WVU process variant has been carried out at pressures below 400 psig, a significant difference.

40|$|Three <b>metallurgical</b> <b>cokes</b> {{made from}} coking coals over a {{significant}} range in rank {{were subjected to}} treatment with blast furnace-like gas composition-temperature profile to 1 673 K, annealing under N 2 to 2 273 K and gasification with subsequent annealing at 1 873 and 2 273 K. The degradation of cokes after reaction and annealing was characterised using I-drum tumbling, tensile testing, ultra-micro indentation and X-ray diffraction. Both gasification and annealing decreased the mechanical strength of coke. Compared with annealing at 1 673 K, gasification at same temperature caused larger degradation for all three cokes, and the effect was more significant on more reactive coke. In the annealing process, degradation of the cokes occurred through the entire coke lump and resulted in both tensile strength and I-drum tumbling strength decreasing simultaneously. In the process of gasification under the blast furnace-like conditions, degradation took place through the whole piece of coke with high reactivity; however, the degradation of coke with low reactivity was more severe at the periphery than in the core and therefore gasification had a minimal effect on {{the core of the}} coke and its tensile strength, but had a much stronger effect on I* 600. Microstrength of coke decreased significantly with increasing annealing temperature. The change of microstrength of coke upon gasification, which occurred at relatively low temperatures, was marginal.

40|$|Submerged {{electric}} arc furnace (SAF) is the major process in industrial production of ferroalloys, in which metal oxides are reduced by carbon. To decrease the production cost, a variety of carbonaceous materials is used including <b>metallurgical</b> <b>cokes,</b> chars and coals. Properties of these carbonaceous materials are strongly affected by the heating in the furnace. The project studied effect of heat treatment on properties of cokes, chars and coals (laboratory chars), including microstructure (XRD and Raman spectroscopy of inert and reactive maceral-derived components IMDC and RMDC), micro-strength (micro-indentation of IMDC and RMDC) and macro-strength (tumbling strength and tensile strength), pyrolysis and porosity. The projects aim was to develop further understanding of factors affecting integrity of carbonaceous materials under conditions of SAF in production of manganese alloys. Upon the heating, strength of chars and laboratory chars was strongly enhanced by the heat treatment at temperature below 1100 °C; strength of cokes was slightly degraded after heat treatment at 1500 °C. Mechanical strength of carbonaceous materials was demonstrated to be significantly affected by micro strength and porosity. Micro strength of chars and coals was significantly enhanced by heat treatment, whereas micro strength of cokes was only marginally increased by heat treatment. The major growth in the micro strength of chars and coals took place at annealing temperature below 1100 °C {{as a result of}} pyrolysis. Porosity of chars and coals significantly increased in the annealing at temperature below 1100 °C due to volatile matter release. Further increasing annealing temperature from 1100 &# 8210; 1500 °C caused marginal porosity evolution in coals and chars by the reduction of oxides of a mineral phase. Porosity of cokes increased slightly in the temperature range of 1300 &# 8210; 1500 °C as result of reactions with the mineral phase. Heat annealing of carbonaceous materials above 1100 ºC significantly increased the degree of graphitization. Graphitisation degree of RMDC was higher than that of IMDC, and annealing had a stronger effect on the graphitisation of RMDC than on IMDC. It was concluded that among carbonaceous materials studied in this project, Char 1 and Coal 1 are most suitable to replace coke...|$|R
