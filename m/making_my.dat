[...] In 2008, he graduated from Göteborgs Högre Samskola. He then went on to pursue a degree in industrial economics and technology management at Chalmers University of Technology, but left the university in 2011.

500|$|In 1803, after a {{succession}} of commands, Heywood was promoted to post-captain. In command of , Heywood {{conducted a series of}} surveys of the eastern coasts of Ceylon and India, areas that had not been studied previously, and produced what Alexander describes as [...] "beautifully drafted charts". In later years he was to produce similar charts for the north coast of Morocco, the River Plate area of South America, parts of the coasts of Sumatra and north-west Australia, and other channels and coastlines. His skill in this area may well have developed from Bligh's tutelage in the earlier stages of the Bounty voyage. Bligh, an accomplished draughtsman, had written of Christian and Heywood: [...] "These two had been objects of my particular regard and attention, and I had taken great pains to instruct them." [...] James Horsburgh, who was hydrographer to the East India Company, wrote that Heywood's work had [...] "essentially contributed to <b>making</b> <b>my</b> Sailing Directory for the Indian navigation much more perfect than it would otherwise have been." [...] The extent of Heywood's professional reputation was demonstrated when the position of Admiralty Hydrographer was offered to him in 1818, after he had retired from the sea. He declined, and the appointment went to Francis Beaufort on Heywood's recommendation.|$|E

[...] 1UP.com's Mike Nelson wrote [...] "On one hand, it feels like I can recommend this to any fan of the Fallout series. I single these fans out because they're willing to forgive silly bugs like meeting characters who walk into walls or occasionally float in mid-air. These fans realize that the game as a whole is greater than the sum of minor graphical anomalies. [...] On the other hand, I simply can't ignore or forgive the game for crashing on me when I walk around the Mojave Wasteland; or for quests that simply can't be completed because of a game glitch; or for <b>making</b> <b>my</b> companions disappear when I need them the most during a battle.

500|$|On May 30, 2010—five {{years to}} the day after Holloway's disappearance—Stephany Flores Ramírez, a 21-year-old {{business}} student, was reported missing in Lima, Peru. She was found dead three days later in a hotel room registered in Van der Sloot's name. On June 3, Van der Sloot was arrested in Chile on a murder charge and extradited to Peru the next day. On June 7, Peruvian authorities said that Van der Sloot confessed to killing Flores after he lost his temper because she accessed his laptop without permission and found information linking him to Holloway. Police chief César Guardia related that Van der Sloot told Peruvian police that he knew where Holloway's body was and offered to help Aruban authorities find it. However, Guardia stated that the interrogation was limited to their case in Peru, and that questions about Holloway's disappearance were avoided. On June 11, Van der Sloot was charged in Lima Superior Court with first-degree murder and robbery. On June 15, Aruban and Peruvian authorities announced an agreement to cooperate and allow investigators from Aruba to interview Van der Sloot at Miguel Castro Castro prison in Peru. In a September 2010 interview from the prison, Van der Sloot reportedly admitted to the extortion plot, stating: [...] "I wanted to get back at Natalee's family—her parents have been <b>making</b> <b>my</b> life tough for five years." [...] On January 11, 2012, Van der Sloot pleaded guilty to murdering Ramírez and was sentenced to 28 years in prison.|$|E
