60|$|The camp {{boys had}} {{followed}} the evidence, and a clamor of voices answered the query. Big eyes glistened, black thumbs were run along twinkling <b>matchet</b> blades, and Dane distinguished ominous cries.|$|E
60|$|Amadu laughed mirthlessly, and {{fingering}} the hilt of the straight blade glanced at Monday, whose face was very grim, {{and the little}} negro, Bad Dollar, crouching close by with a polished <b>matchet</b> in his hand.|$|E
60|$|Monday went reluctantly, and {{returned}} {{to say that one}} of the sentries and his gun had vanished completely. Then a half-naked man with a <b>matchet</b> burst through the wondering group which had gathered about the pair, demanding assistance to search for his brother.|$|E
6000|$|... "These men march well," [...] said Maxwell. [...] "We {{should reach}} the camp {{within a week}} if nothing hinders us. Tell them to spread out a little and keep their <b>matchets</b> ready. The cane is getting thicker." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Dom Clemente, [...] "I {{believe he}} did. Still, {{there are men}} who can {{recognize}} when they must fight or fail ignominiously. One has a certain respect for them. I {{do not think it}} was that negro's fault that he was driven back. Flintlocks and <b>matchets</b> are not much use against our rifles." ...|$|R
50|$|They are {{subsistence}} agriculturalists depending more {{on their}} locally produced agricultural tools like hoes, axes and <b>matchets.</b> Their most staple food crop till present is yam (Dioscorea spp). They also engage in craftsand artistic works like blacksmithing, carving, basket making, weaving. Their women cultivate majorly garden egg and fresh pepper. They also engaged in activities with their neighbouring towns.|$|R
60|$|The men lay {{about the}} stockade with their rusty guns beside them, the negro, Bad Dollar, filing his <b>matchet,</b> {{as he did}} continually. The man Dane called Monday, however, {{crouched}} close beside him. A curious friendship had sprung up between the two, and they would talk long together with mutual satisfaction, though neither of them fully understood his companion.|$|E
60|$|They waited, {{somewhat}} anxiously, {{for several}} days, knowing that Herrero, whose presence promised to complicate affairs, was drawing nearer all the while. There was, however, no other course open to them, {{for when they}} attempted to leave the hut a big man armed with a <b>matchet</b> who kept watch outside informed them it was the Headman's pleasure that they should stay there until he was at liberty to talk to them.|$|E
60|$|Half-awake, Dane {{groped for}} the breastwork, falling over several negroes on the way, {{and when he}} reached it the {{blackness}} was Egyptian. There was nothing visible beyond the loom of shadowy trunks, but Dane could hear unseen men breathing heavily, the click-clack of flintlocks, and the rasp of a file along a <b>matchet</b> blade. Then a faint crackle which drew nearer {{came out of the}} grass, and instantly a blaze of weird blue radiance leaped up, showing Maxwell's spare figure perched recklessly aloft upon the breastwork with a port-fire held high above him. Its glare beat along the <b>matchet</b> blades, the gun-barrels, and the oily skin of the men beneath, and showed black patches which might have been arms or heads among the grass. Then it died out; and Dane pitched the rifle to his shoulder at Maxwell's shout. There was neither challenge nor parley. They were now beyond civilized jurisdiction, and the right of any man to existence in that country depends upon the strength of his hand.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{only two}} games played from start during 2005 Malmqvist stayed in Trelleborg after his loan period had expired. The same year Trelleborg won Superettan, with Linus Malmqvist playing 29 matches from start. Trelleborg succeeded to avoid {{regulation}} in Allsvenskan 2007 and Malmqvist played 22 <b>matchets,</b> including the away game against IFK Gothenburg on Nya Ullevi where {{a crowd of}} 41,471 witnessed Gothenburg becoming Swedish champions.|$|R
6000|$|... "There are {{crocodiles}} in that stream," [...] smiled Dane. [...] "You {{will take}} men {{you can trust}} and hide them where the path winds down to the water, Amadu. Monday, {{you will see that}} until I call, no boy leaves the camp, but let them lie down with their <b>matchets</b> beside them. Bad Dollar will wait with me; and I will borrow Cappy Maxwell's gun to-night, Amadu." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then don't {{let your}} boys start {{shooting}} until they crawl close in," [...] Dane answered, with an indifference assumed {{to reassure the}} rest [...] "Some of those fellows can't hit anything with a gun, and you had better keep a few as a standby in case they {{come in with a}} run. Let them wait until the bushmen lib for climb the stockade, and then split their heads with the <b>matchets.</b> You understand me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where is the other? There were two?" [...] he asked; and it {{was with}} relief that he saw Bad Dollar, whom he had forgotten, shamble toward him and then turn beckoning. Dane {{followed}} the negro, who held high a blazing brand, toward where another monstrous object lay full length among the trampled undergrowth. The fur had fallen partly clear of the flesh beneath, and he saw that Bad Dollar's <b>matchet</b> had done its work.|$|E
60|$|They {{followed}} him to the compound gate, where Gilby gazed longingly at the forest and then sighed as he surveyed the line of brawny men, each of whom stood waiting beside his burden. Their clothing was simple. Broad folds of white cotton hung over one shoulder, and, drooping to the knee, were belted at the waist by a band from which a <b>matchet</b> hung. A number of the men also carried long flintlock guns.|$|E
60|$|In regions {{richer than}} the Upper Gambia the {{disappearance}} of man is ever followed by a springing of bush and forest so portentous that a few hands are helpless and hopeless. Such {{is the case with}} the great wooded belt north of the Gold Coast, where even the second-growth becomes impenetrable without the <b>matchet,</b> and where the swamps and muds, bred and fed by torrential rains, bar the transit of travellers. The Whydah and Gaboon countries are notable specimens of once populous regions now all but deserted.|$|E
6000|$|This place, again, is a {{favourite}} labour-market. The {{return of}} the Krumen repeats the spectacles of Sinou, and war being here chronic, the canoe-men come off armed with guns, swords, and <b>matchets.</b> After a frightful storm of tongues, and much bustle but no work, the impatient steamer begins to waggle her screw; powder-kegs and dwarf boxes are tossed overboard, and every attention is bestowed upon them; whilst a boy or two is left behind, either to swim ashore or to find a 'watery grave.' ...|$|R
60|$|They {{started in}} the heat of that afternoon, and Ormsgill, marching with his boys, watched the long dusky column wind into the forest in front of him. There were men with Snider rifles, which they were indifferently {{accustomed}} to, men with glinting <b>matchets,</b> and men with flintlock guns and spears, besides rows of plodding carriers. They were half-naked most of them, men of primitive passions and no great intelligence, but they had risen at last in their desperation to strike for freedom. Behind them rose a tumultuous uproar of barbaric music, insistent and deafening, that floated far over the forest. Ormsgill smiled a little as it grew fainter.|$|R
60|$|He {{stood still}} for another few moments, grim in face, with his jacket rent, {{and a little}} trickle of blood running from one hand which a thorn had gashed. Every nerve in him tingled with fierce anger, {{but he knew that}} the man who runs counter to {{established}} customs has usually more than misconception to face in Africa, especially if he sympathizes with the oppressed, and he was one who could wait. Then the boys came floundering through the undergrowth, one or two with heavy <b>matchets,</b> and one or two with long flintlock guns, but Ormsgill, who recognized that pursuit would certainly prove futile even if they were willing to undertake it, drove them back to the fire again.|$|R
60|$|There {{was also}} {{a change in the}} negroes' attitude. They had maltreated their own countrymen at their will, but they had as yet never laid hands upon a white man. Perhaps, it was the rum Herrero had given them which had stirred their courage, and, perhaps, they {{regarded}} a missionary as a good-humored fool who had for some inconceivable reason flung the white man's prerogative away. In any case, they were coming up the stairway, three or four of them, and now the first man carried a <b>matchet,</b> an instrument which resembles an old-fashioned cutlass. Nares, who asked for no directions, sprang into the room behind him where one of the trestle cots not unusual in that country stood. It had a stout wooden frame, and he rent one bar from the canvas laced to it. In another moment he was back {{at the head of the}} stairway where the man in charge of the station stood, frail, and haggard, but very quiet, with his thin jacket rent open where the negro had seized him. A foot or two below him the man with the <b>matchet</b> was coming up, naked to the waist, and half-crazed with rum. Nares could see his eyes in the moonlight, and that was enough.|$|E
60|$|After lying {{for a time}} on the matting {{at one end of}} the tent, he {{rose and}} turned the lamp out; the {{watching}} then was not cheerful, and it was comforting to feel the weight of the big gun upon his knee. The last hum of voices had died away in camp, the fires burned low, and except for an occasional floundering beside the creek, the bush was strangely silent. The darkness was now intense. The wild animals would await moonrise to begin their hunting; what Dane expected would happen before then. He could not see Bad Dollar, who crouched somewhere near the entrance of the tent, though he heard his file grate softly upon a <b>matchet,</b> and could picture him running a black thumb along the keen-edged blade at every cessation.|$|E
60|$|Above the rock-line is a selvage of low vegetation--ipom[oe]a, {{white and}} mauve-flowered; rushes and tangle-grass, {{a variety of}} salsolaceæ, and the cyperus, whose stalk is used like the kalam, or reed-pen, further east. These growths are filmed with spiders' webs, whose central shafts lead to their nests. The highest levels, {{only a few feet}} above water, are grown with a dense bush that wants the <b>matchet.</b> Here are remains of plantations, a little knot of bananas, a single tall cocoanut, many young palms, and a few felled trunks {{overgrown}} with oysters. Europeans have proposed to build bungalows on Bobowusúa, where they find fresh sea-air, and a little shooting among the red-breasted ring-doves, rails, and green pigeons affecting the vegetation. It appears to us a good place for mooring hulks. The steamers could then run alongside of them and discharge cargo for the coming tramway, while surf-boats carrying two or three tons could load for the Ancobra River.|$|E
60|$|Then as Ormsgill {{sprang to}} his feet the bush rang with a yell, and a swarm of half-naked negroes poured tumultuously out of it. There was no firing among them. They ran forward with glinting <b>matchets</b> and spears and brandished flintlock guns, and Ormsgill knew that now, at least, they would {{certainly}} get in. In another moment he was running furiously towards them, and so {{far as he could}} remember afterwards none of the men in whose charge he had been troubled themselves about him. It was some way {{to the front of the}} stockade, and when he got there he was hemmed in by a surging crowd. There was smoke in his eyes, and a bewildering din through which he heard the thudding of the quick-firing gun, but where Nares was he did not know. He could only go forward with the press, and he ran on in a fit of hot vindictive fury.|$|R
60|$|It {{was with}} as little parade of weapons as {{possible}} that the expedition headed for the coast, for the men had their orders and Amadu saw they were carried out. Those who carried <b>matchets</b> wore them hidden under their cotton robes, while at times {{the rank and file}} were allowed to straggle unchecked, with small semblance of discipline, in a drawn-out line. The discipline, however, was there, and disaster would have overtaken any bushmen who attempted to profit by the apparent lack of it. Dane did not order defenses of any kind to be raised at night, and generally had his tent pitched apart from the main camp; so that when they had made wide detours through dense forest and reeking swamp, some of the black men commenced to murmur as well as wonder at his recklessness. Amadu, Monday, and the negro, Bad Dollar, with whom he held long conferences, realized, however, that their leader was by no means inconsistent, even if they did not know that he was to all intents and purposes the victim of a monomania.|$|R
60|$|Dane {{certainly}} did, having enjoyed {{little sleep}} worth mentioning {{since he left}} the coast. Indeed, he could scarcely keep his eyes open, and he wondered vacantly that Maxwell, who seemed proof against the climate, should show no sign of fatigue. When he unrolled his strip of matting and water-proof inside the little tent, the African sunset was flaming in the west, and the cottonwoods crowning the ridge stood out black as ebony against its almost unearthly brilliancy. Among them fantastic figures, some naked as when they first entered the world, some draped in white and blue, crouched about the cooking fires; while, seen between two mighty buttresses of living wood which stayed ponderous trunks, men with <b>matchets</b> and long guns were curled up beneath the breastwork. The wood smoke drifted in filmy wisps athwart the lonely camp, the swamp steamed like a cauldron, and the chirruping of countless frogs rose out of the vapor. Then the brief brilliancy faded, and thick impenetrable darkness suddenly rolled down. The faint coolness that came with it brought sleep to Dane, and it was midnight when Maxwell's voice roused him.|$|R
60|$|Some of the negroes {{began to}} chatter; some shrank farther back; {{but there was}} {{presently}} an ominous growling, and again the mob surged forward, one man with a <b>matchet</b> launching himself straight at his white master. Hitherto he had shown himself both cheerful and docile, but now he seemed possessed of a devil, the devil of fear transmuted into maniacal savagery. Maxwell did not at first see him, {{and when he did}} it would have been too late, but that Dane whirled aloft the shovel, and when it came down the negro fell like a pole-axed ox at his comrade's feet. Even then Dane felt sick and sorry as he saw the red drops run from the steel, for he had often encouragingly patted his victim's brawny shoulder; but the negro is above all things unstable, and that blow was the saving of many lives. The crowd stood silent, cowed for a few moments by the swift retribution.|$|E
60|$|Dane's nerves were tolerably good, {{but when}} he passed the creepers he {{experienced}} a shock of nausea and halted abruptly. Two black men were scooping out a trench, while another crouched near by, crooning something while he ran his thumb caressingly {{up and down a}} <b>matchet</b> blade. He looked up at the white man's coming, and his face was a study. Horror was stamped upon it; but a slow, relentless ferocity was written there too. This Dane saw with his first glance, but after the second he turned his eyes away. Maxwell was right. They had found the missing sentry. The object--for there was little resemblance of humanity left in what lay a foul blotch on the forest before him--was stretched across the trail; and the neck was twisted so that the face, left whole, looked down the pathway the way the expedition should have come, distorted and ghastly, with its changeless grin of pain. Words appeared superfluous, but Dane's sensations demanded relief in speech.|$|E
60|$|Dane, {{guessing}} that Bad Dollar's <b>matchet</b> had bitten deep, {{and that}} his carrier comrades would see his victim did not escape, turned at top-most speed {{in the direction of}} the creek. Men came running behind him; but a heavier sound was audible through the patter of their feet, and he knew that one who was not barefooted fled for his life near ahead. He was running fast, but Dane, flinging the gun down, knew that he was gaining, and remembered that the man he sought would find his passage barred across the creek. So they ran, straining every sinew in a desperate race. Now and then one smashed through a thorn brake, or staggered, catching his foot in a creeper vine, but neither went down, and the gurgle of the creek grew nearer all the time. Dane raised his voice, and though his cry was barely articulate it proved sufficient, and as Amadu's hail came back in answer the footsteps before him grew slower, and a tongue of flame shot up.|$|E
60|$|Nares {{felt that}} the scene was already {{sufficiently}} impressive. The strip of empty sand {{in front of him}} flung up a dazzling glare. The sky the palm tufts cut against was of a harsh blue that one could scarcely look upon, and the village was flooded with an almost intolerable brilliancy which flashed upon glittering <b>matchets</b> and Snider barrels. It also smote the massed white draperies and flickered with an oily gleam on ebony limbs and the sea of dusky faces turned expectantly towards the group beneath the thatch. Most of the men there sat on the ground, but there were two seated figures, the village Headman, and the Suzerain lord of his country, the old man they had met already, on a slightly higher stool. He, at least, was dressed in dignified fashion in a long robe of spotless cotton, and a few men with tall spears stood in state behind him. His face was impassively grim, and Nares's heart beat a trifle faster as his eyes rested on him, {{but at the same time}} he was sensible of an expectancy so tense that it drove out personal anxiety. He almost felt that he was watching for the opening of the drama from a place of safety.|$|R
60|$|Herrero's {{boys were}} once {{more at the}} foot of the stairway, {{trampling}} on their comrade as they scrambled over him, but there were now two men with extemporized weapons at the head of it who stood above them and had them at a disadvantage. Nares was, however, never quite clear as to what happened during the next few minutes, for an unreasoning fury came upon him, and he saw only the woolly heads and dusky faces as he gasped and smote, though he was vaguely conscious that now and then a shattered chair somebody whirled by the legs swung above his head. Then a long gun flashed, and the detonation was answered by a sharper, ringing crash. One of Herrero's boys screamed shrilly, and the half-naked figures went scrambling down the stairway. They had scarcely floundered clear of it when a man in white duck appeared in the space below, and flung up a rifle, and another of the boys who went down headlong lay writhing horribly in the sand. After that there was a shouting and a patter of flying feet, and further dusky men with <b>matchets</b> and Snider rifles poured out of the path that wound down the hillside. Nares quietly laid the bar he held against the wall, and turned to the others with a gasp.|$|R
60|$|Like {{most of the}} coast-races, the Vái seem to be arrant cowards. The headmen salute their {{visitors}} Arab-fashion, with flourishes of the sword; but swording ends there. Of late {{they were}} attacked by the savages of the interior, Gallinas, Pannis, and Kúsús. The latter, meaning the 'wolves' or the 'wild boars,' is the popular nickname of the Mendi or Mindi tribes, occupying the Sherbro-banks. They did excellent service in the last Ashanti war (1873-74) by flogging forward the fugitive Fantis. Winwood Keade, [Footnote: The Story of the Ashanti Campaign. Smith & Elder, London, 1874. It is a thousand pities that the volume was pruned, to use the mildest term. My friend's memory seems to brighten with the years, doubtless the effect of his heroic honesty in telling what he held to be the truth. His Martyrdom of Man, in which even his publisher did not believe, has reached a fourth edition; it was quoted by Mr. Gladstone, and Mrs. Grundy still buys it, {{in order to put}} it behind the fire.] an excellent judge of Africans, declares that they are very courageous, 'keen as mustard' for the fray. On the raid they creep up to and surround the doomed village; they raise the war-cry shortly before sunrise, and, as the villagers fly, they tell them by the touch. If the body feels warm after sleep, unlike their own dew-cooled skins, it soon becomes a corpse. They advance with two long knives, generally <b>matchets,</b> one held between the teeth. They prefer the white arm because 'guns miss fire, but swords are like the chicken's beak, that never fails to hit the grain.' Some 250 of these desperadoes lately drove off 5,000 of the semi-civilised recreants and took about 560 prisoners, including the 'King' of the Vái.|$|R
60|$|Then several rifles flashed {{among the}} bags, and the negroes {{went up the}} {{stairway}} with a yell. Ormsgill fancied that two or three men went down about him, and had a vague remembrance of trampling on yielding bodies, but he went up uninjured, and leapt up upon the barricade. The veranda was thick with smoke now, but he saw Dom Erminio suddenly lean forward with the long blade gleaming in his hand, and a black soldier who crouched close beside his feet tearing at his rifle breech. That, however, was all he saw, for in another moment he leapt down, and a swarm of half-naked men with spears and matchets swept into the veranda. What he did next he knew no more than those about him probably did, but when at length he reeled out of the smoke-filled building and down the stairway the <b>matchet</b> {{was no longer in}} his hand, and he wondered vaguely that there was so far as he could discover not a scratch on him. Still he felt a trifle dazed, and as his head ached intolerably he sat down gasping.|$|E
60|$|As Dane halted, a naked carrier stumbled, and, {{dropping}} the deal case from his woolly crown, splashed him all over. Another straightway fell over his prostrate comrade, {{and began a}} spirited attack upon him when they scrambled to their feet again. Dane was too weary to rebuke either in the fashion they would best understand; but a man of dusky color undertook the duty for him, with {{the barrel of a}} gaspipe gun, and the combatants, desisting, found new places in the straggling line. A few picked men in flowing white draperies with flintlock guns on their shoulders were already floundering through the swamp ahead. Behind them, almost and wholly naked negroes, many wearing on their forehead the blue band which marks the amphibious Kroo, went splashing by, each bearing a deal case or tarred cloth package upon his crown. Then the rearguard, tall and soldierly men with the blood of the Arab in them, who carried old-fashioned rifles in spite of certain regulations, came up with Maxwell. They wore a ragged white uniform, swore by the Prophet, and were, as Dane subsequently discovered, reliable fighting men. The Krooboys carried a cutlass-shaped <b>matchet,</b> a by no means despicable weapon when rubbed keen with a file.|$|E
60|$|Here {{and there}} a man about him screamed, and {{now and then a}} half-seen figure {{collapsed}} in front of him, but this time no one stopped or turned. They were all crazed with primitive passion, and were going in. Ormsgill, pressing onwards with them, saw that he had now a <b>matchet</b> in his hand, though he had no recollection of how it came there. Then the thudding of the gun ceased suddenly and the air was rent by a breathless gasping yell. The stockade rose right over him, and he went headlong at the gap in it from which there protruded the muzzle of the gun. Somebody behind him hurled him through the opening, and he dropped inside. As he scrambled to his feet he saw a swarm of men running towards the residency, and he went with them, partly because he wished to get there and also because those who poured through the gap behind him drove him along. He had afterwards a fancy that he saw a white man lying not far from the gun, but he could not be certain, for the negroes were thick about him, and he was not in a mood to interest himself in anything of that kind just then. He was possessed by an unreasoning fury, and an overwhelming desire to reach the men who had treacherously shot his comrade.|$|E
60|$|This fine {{concession}} is {{a rectangular}} parallelogram, whose dimensions are 2,000 yards long {{from north to}} south, by a breadth of half. The village stands outside the south-western angle, and the Fía rivulet runs through the south-eastern corner. The surface is rolling ground, with a rise and a depression trending from south-west to north-east. The whole extent, except where 'bush' lingers, is an old plantation of bananas, manioc, and ground-nuts. There is an ample supply of good hard timber, but red pitch-pine or creosoted teak from England would last much longer. Amongst the trees are especially noted the copal, the gamboge, rich in sticky juice, the brovi, {{said to be the}} hardest wood, and the dum, or African mahogany (Oldfieldia africana), well known in Ceylon as excellent material for boat-building. There was an abundance of the Calabar-bean (Physostigma venenosum), once used for an ordeal-poison, and now applied by surgery in ophthalmic and other complaints. The 'tie-tie,' as Anglo-Africans call the rope-like creepers, was also plentiful; it may prove valuable for cordage, and possibly for paper-making. I was pleased to see the ease with which the heaped-up jungle-growth is burnt at this season and the facility of road-making. Half a dozen Kru-boys with their <b>matchets</b> can open, at the rate of some miles a day, a path fit to carry a 'sulky;' and the ground wants only metalling with the stone which lines every stream. At the same time I hold that here, as in Mexico, we should begin with railways and tramways. Nor will there be any difficulty in keeping down the jungle. The soft and silky Bahama-grass has been brought from Sá Leone to Axim, where it covers the open spaces, and it grows well at Akankon. There is no trouble except to plant a few roots, which extend themselves afar; and the carpet when thick allows, like the orange-tree, no undergrowth.|$|R
6000|$|A {{striking}} {{institution of}} the Congo region {{is that of the}} Jinkemba, which, curious to say, is unnoticed by Tuckey. It is not, however, peculiar to the Congo; it is the [...] "Semo" [...] of the Susus or Soosoos of the Windward Coast, and the [...] "Purrah" [...] of the Sherbro-Balloms or Bulloms, rendered Anglicè by [...] "free-masonry." [...] The novitiate there lasts for seven or eight years, and whilst the boys live in the woods food is placed for them by their relations: the initiation, indeed, appears to be especially severe. Here all the free-born males are subjected to the wrongly called [...] "Mosaic rite." [...] Merolla tells us that the wizards circumcise children on the eighth day (like the Jews), not out of regard for the law, but with some wicked end and purpose of their own. At any time between the ages of five and fifteen (eight to ten being generally preferred), boys are taken from their parents (which must be an exceeding comfort to the latter), and for a native year, which is half of ours, they must dwell in the Vivála ya Ankimba, or Casa de Feitiço, like that which we passed before reaching Banza Nokki. They are now instructed by the Nganga in the practices of their intricate creed; they are taught the mysteries under solemn oaths, and, in fine, they are prepared for marriage. Upon the Congo they must eat no cooked food, living wholly upon roots and edibles; but they are allowed to enter the villages for provisions, and here they often appear armed with <b>matchets,</b> bayonets, and wooden swords. Their faces and necks, bodies and arms, are ghastly white with chalk or ashes; the hair is left in its original jet, and the dingy lower limbs contrast violently with the ghostlike absence of colour above. The dress is a crinoline of palm-fronds, some fresh and green, others sere and brown; a band of strong mid-rib like a yellow hoop passed round the waist spreads out the petticoat like a farthingale, and the ragged ends depend to the knees; sometimes it is worn under the axillae, but in all cases the chalked arms must be outside. The favourite attitude is that of the Rhodian Colossus, with the elbows bent to the fore and the hands clasped behind the head. To increase their prestige of terror, the Jinkomba abjure the use of human language, and, meeting a stranger, ejaculate with all their might, [...] "Hár-rr-rr-rr-rr!" [...] and [...] "Jojolo! Jojolo!" [...] words mystic and meaningless. When walking in procession, they warn the profane out of the way by striking one slip of wood upon another. They are wilder in appearance than the Hindu Jogi or Sanyasi, who also affects the use of ashes, but neglects that of the palm-thatch. It is certainly enough to startle a man of impressible nerves-- one, for instance, who cannot enter a room without a side-long glance at an unexpected coffin--to see these hideous beings starting with their savage cry from the depths of an African forest. Evidently, also, such is the intention of the costume.|$|R
60|$|Close {{behind the}} white man a shapeless heap of fur and black flesh lay quivering upon the over-turned tent. Half-seen for a second a dim figure, whose {{garments}} were not those of a native, vanished among the remoter trunks. Men with weapons came flitting {{out of the shadows}} which shrouded the camp; and about thirty yards away a monstrous object with the head of a beast and the legs of a man was slinking toward a creeper festoon. Dane flung the gun to his shoulder and fired as it ran, but the glare of the light beat transversely along the barrel, blinding him. Springing clear of the filmy smoke, he saw the second assailant was still running, and he sprang forward without waiting to reload. The light would last but a few more seconds. Still, the object moved at twice his speed, and might have escaped but that as he blundered on, choking in his haste, a diminutive figure ran forth to meet it, and the beast flung an upper limb aloft. Dane saw the spear which had been meant for his destruction draw back to stab; but the negro, Bad Dollar, sprang sideways, and his broad <b>matchet,</b> long filed to a razor-edge, flared under the last flicker of the light as he swung it round his head. Then there was sudden darkness, a thud and a crash.|$|E
