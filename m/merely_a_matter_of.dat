The argument of the Jews' historical right to the land was <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> politics and propaganda. In view of the catastrophic situation of the Jews {{at the beginning of the}} century, the use of this argument was justified in every way, and it is all the more legitimate because of the threat of death hanging over the Jews. Historical rights were invoked to serve the need of finding a refuge.|$|E
25|$|The Indo-Aryan {{languages}} are commonly assigned to three major groups – Old, Middle and New Indo-Aryan. The classification reflects consecutive stages {{in a common}} linguistic development, but is not <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> chronology: Classical Sanskrit, as a codified derivate of Vedic Sanskrit, remains mostly representative of the Old Indo-Aryan stage, even though it continued to flourish {{at the same time}} as the Middle Indo-Aryan languages. Conversely, a number of the morphophonological and lexical features of the Middle Indo-Aryan languages show that they are not direct continuations of Ṛvedic Sanskrit, the main base of Classical Sanskrit. Instead they descend from other dialects similar to, but in some ways more archaic than Rigvedic.|$|E
25|$|Rico {{appears as}} the main villain and {{antagonist}} in the 1995 Judge Dredd movie, in which Joe was played by Sylvester Stallone and Rico by Armand Assante. In this version, although they were cloned from identical DNA, they did not look the same. Rico was portrayed as a straightforward psychopath, having {{reached a point where}} he killed the innocent {{on the grounds that the}} division between guilt and innocence was <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> timing and everyone would commit a crime in time. His deviant behavior was attributed to something going wrong in his creation which made him the perfect criminal. They were both friends in school (Joe was unaware of their true kinship, but it is unclear when Rico learned about their connection), but when he became a murderer, Joe judged him and sentenced him to execution, and his death was faked to reassure the public and prevent the truth of the clone program coming to light.|$|E
