I asked for clarification– after all, Run DMC and LL Cool J are {{considered}} old-school, but technically, they invented the new school. The response: 'I don't know, some Tribe Called Quest or something.' After gently picking <b>my</b> <b>jaw</b> from off the floor, I turned back to my crates and wondered to myself, 'If Tribe is old-school, what does that make Kurtis Blow? In utero?'"—Oliver Wang, [...] "Book report", San Francisco Bay Guardian, April 6, 2003.|$|E
500|$|Ellie Kendrick, who portrays Meera Reed, {{spoke about}} {{the writing of the}} episode {{following}} its airing, and revealed that she was surprised by the scene, saying [...] "When I was reading the episode, I completely forgot that I was a character in the show. I was reading it with such excitement, because this is a real story unfolding, with so many mysteries and quantum leaps and Inception-style traveling between the past and the present. I found it very exciting. So the first time I read it, I was just reading it for enjoyment, really, because it was so well-written and exciting. Once I picked <b>my</b> <b>jaw</b> up off the floor, I was really keen to get started working on it, because it's such an epic sequence." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{cover was}} controversial; {{editions of the}} album sold at Circuit City came housed in a {{cardboard}} sleeve featuring an alternate cover, while Walmart and Kmart refused to stock the album at all. A pastor in Memphis, Tennessee threatened {{to go on a}} hunger strike unless the album was pulled from shelves. Manson described these actions as attempts at censorship: [...] "The irony is that my point of the photo on the album was to show people that the crucifixion of Christ is, indeed, a violent image. <b>My</b> <b>jaw</b> is missing as a symbol of this very kind of censorship. This doesn't piss me off as much as it pleases me, because those offended by my album cover have successfully proven my point." [...] In 2008, Gigwise ranked it at number ten on their list of [...] "The 50 Most Controversial Album Covers of All Time".|$|E

500|$|In early 2003, [...] {{while in}} Los Angeles {{and before they}} met with {{producer}} Gregg Hoffman, Hoffman's friend pulled him {{into his office and}} showed him the short. Hoffman said, [...] "About two or three minutes into it, <b>my</b> <b>jaw</b> hit the floor." [...] He quickly showed the short and script to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules of Evolution Entertainment. They later formed Twisted Pictures as a horror genre production label. The producers read the screenplay that night and two days later offered Wan and Whannell creative control and 25% of the net profits. Even though Wan and Whannell received [...] "better offers" [...] from studios like DreamWorks and Gold Circle Films, they were not willing to chance Wan's directing and Whannell acting in the lead role. In order to finance the film, Hoffman, Burg, and Koules put up a second mortgage on their Highland Avenue headquarters. Saw was given a production budget of between $1 million and $1.2 million.|$|E
500|$|Casting for the {{character}} was hectic, with Oberman describing the process as a [...] "whirlwind" [...] affair. The role of the second Mrs Den Watts was highly sought after with Oberman eventually beating out high-profile stars like Patsy Kensit, Cheryl Baker and Joanna Lumley for the part. In a 2004 'Star Chat' interview featured in The People, Oberman commented on her casting: [...] "I couldn't have wished for a better part. I mean the Watts family are a national institution. When I realised I was auditioning {{for the role of}} Dirty Den's wife, <b>my</b> <b>jaw</b> just dropped. I never thought I'd get it. Amazing, swanky actresses, like Joanna Lumley and Patsy Kensit, were all considered, but Leslie Grantham and I had great chemistry from the off and I think he said: 'I want her.'" [...] Oberman was on holiday when she received a call saying she had been cast in the role and was required to be on set the next Tuesday. All told the audition process had taken just two weeks, with Oberman beginning filming a mere ten days after her initial screen test. In fact the schedule was so tight that Oberman was on set and taping scenes before a contract had even been signed.|$|E

2500|$|After Ortiz's {{scheduled}} rematch against Andre Berto {{fell through}} when Berto {{tested positive for}} a banned substance, his promotional team quickly found a late replacement in Josesito Lopez. However, {{just days before the}} fight was scheduled to take place, Ortiz was announced as the opponent for Saúl Álvarez in the main event of a Pay-Per-View show entitled [...] "Knockout Kings" [...] scheduled for September 15, 2012 if he were to defeat Lopez. Ortiz fought Lopez at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on June 23. In an exciting fight, both fighters repeatedly engaged in competitive exchanges, as opposed to the one-sided bout predicted by many members of the press. At the beginning of the tenth round, Ortiz's team threw in the towel when the fighter complained of a broken jaw, subsequently cancelling his possible bout with Alvarez. After the fight, Ortiz stated, [...] "Josesito broke <b>my</b> <b>jaw,</b> I had my mouth open and he broke <b>my</b> <b>jaw.</b> I couldn't close my mouth. It happened early in the (ninth) round. The corner wanted me to continue but I just couldn't." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "We {{are facing}} the most {{powerful}} group in the country ... The best parameter to measure this presentation {{is that it was}} short, it seemed to have lasted ten minutes or so and people were left wanting more. The outpouring of the stadium was a general murmur of the songs from Soda Stereo. The rain, the traffic on Avenida del Libertador was cluttered by those entering and leaving. The last hot dog of the night and a healthy sense of well being, leave no room for existential questions. I then put <b>my</b> <b>jaw</b> back in place and went singing softly [...] "Estoy Azulado" [...] between the rain on Libertador. [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|The Manchester {{performance}} was widely bootlegged (and mistakenly {{placed at the}} Royal Albert Hall). The recording of this gig {{became one of the}} most famous of Dylan's career. In a 1971 review for Creem magazine, critic Dave Marsh wrote, [...] "My response is that crystallization of everything that is rock'n'roll music, at its finest, was to allow <b>my</b> <b>jaw</b> to drop, my body to move, to leap out of the chair ... It is an experience that one desires simply to share, to play over and over again for those he knows thirst for such pleasure. If I speak in an almost worshipful sense about this music, it is not because I have lost perspective, it is precisely because I have found it, within music, yes, that was made five years ago. But it is there and unignorable." [...] When it finally saw [...] in 1998, critic Richie Unterberger declared the record [...] "an important document of rock history." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 26, 2011, {{the first}} video setting footage of Occupy Wall Street {{to the song}} Love, That's America by Melvin Van Peebles was {{uploaded}} to YouTube. In an interview with Van Peebles several weeks later, he discussed the song going viral. Turkish newspaper Radikal described the song as becoming the surprising unofficial anthem of the movement. On January 17, 2012, Van Peebles performed at the Players' Club to honor {{the fact that the}} song has become a theme for the Occupy Wall Street movement. [...] On February 22, 2012, Van Peebles commented further, [...] "When I found out that the song had been co-opted by Occupy Wall Street, <b>my</b> <b>jaw</b> dropped. It went viral online. People were remixing it and mashing it up with videos from the protests. The time I wrote {{it was a time of}} social upheaval — the Stonewall Riots had just happened.

60|$|Not {{being able}} {{to arrive at a}} conclusion, the {{practitioners}} remanded me for farther examination.

2500|$|Stocky, {{grinning}} Capt. Frank Monroe Hawks, famed publicity flyer, {{holder of}} nearly all informal city-to-city speed records in the U.S. and Europe, was not grinning one day last week when attendants at the Worcester, Massachusetts, airport pulled him from beneath his crashed Travel Air [...] "Mystery Plane" [...] Texaco 13. Day before he had hopped from Detroit (in 3 hr. 5 min.). lectured the Worcester Boy Scouts on the necessity of developing foolproof planes, but had delayed his departure until the next morning because of a soggy field. An escort plane had nosed up when it landed just ahead of Capt. Hawks. After attempting to take off from a short dirt road which cut diagonally across the airport, he headed his low-wing monoplane down the field, less than 700 ft. in length. Oozy ground sucked at the wheels, kept him from attaining the 70 m.p.h. required to zoom off. Toward {{the end of the}} runway, going about 50 m.p.h., the ship bounced off a low mound, cut through heavy undergrowth, somersaulted over a stone wall. Hawks cut the motor in time, and saved himself from cremation. Capt. Hawks's nose and jaw were fractured, his face badly battered, several of his big, white teeth knocked out. He lay unconscious in the hospital for hours. Said Harvard Medical School's famed plastic surgeon, Dr. Varaztad Hovhannes Kazanjian: [...] "I do not think his speech will be affected. The operation for restoring his face should leave scarcely a scar." [...] Capt. Hawks's good friend Will Rogers wired: [...] "Sure glad nothing broke but your jaw. That will keep you still for a while. If I broke <b>my</b> <b>jaw,</b> I could still wire gags. What's the matter with you anyhow; are you getting... brittle?" ...|$|E

60|$|Beyond {{the barrier}} cliffs my party was even now nervously {{awaiting}} my return. Presently apprehension and fear would claim them--and {{they would never}} know! They would attempt to scale the cliffs--of that I was sure; but I was not so positive that they would succeed; {{and after a while}} they would turn back, what there were left of them, and go sadly and mournfully upon their return journey to home.
