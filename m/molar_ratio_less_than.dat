The interactions between Li+ and Cl-ions and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) ligands in the polymer electrolytes were investigated by mid and far FT-IR spectroscopy. Results revealed that (a) the PEG chains assume a TGT type conformation; (b) Li+ ions are coordinated by ethereal oxygens of the PEG ligand; (c) at an Li/O <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 036, Cl- ions form hydrogen bonding cages with the terminal OH groups of PEG chains; (d) at an Li/O molar ratio greater than 0. 036, Cl- ions are present both in hydrogen bonds and as “free anions” along PEG chains. Conductivity measurements made at different temperatures showed that these systems conduct ionically, with two distinct conductivity regions detected. The possible correlation between the conductivity {{and the structure of}} these electrolytic systems was also investigated showing that the “free ionic carriers”, which are responsible for the Aσ values, are directly related to the total “free anion” concentration.

Differences were observed in the bioaccumulation of the above elements between the five species. The differences are probably related to biological factors such as age and sex and/or to ecological factors specific to each species such as feeding habits or bioavailability of the various elements. However, no significant relationship was observed between element accumulation and sex. Pilot whale and striped dolphin showed the highest concentrations of renal Cd and the highest concentrations of hepatic Hg and Se, while bottlenose dolphin showed the highest concentrations of Hg in kidneys. An analysis of inter-elemental relationships showed strong positive correlations between Hg and Se in the five species, however most individuals have Hg:Se <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 1 : 1 indicating an excess of Se compare to Hg. This result, probably reflect the high proportion of young animals in the sample available for this study and/or that these animals had a good health status. We also observed a positive correlation in striped dolphins between Cd and Cu and between Cd and Zn in kidneys. In addition, comparing with other studies world-wide, the element concentrations (Hg and Cd) found in Iberian toothed whales indicates that these populations are not specially threatened by Hg and Cd exposure in the area...|$|E

Nonetheless, most of the surface water samples had a <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 1 : 2 (<[*] 1 : 2), suggesting dolomite as the dominant sources of Ca 2 + and HCO 3 − ions. A high ratio of (Ca 2 +[*]+[*]Mg 2 +)/(Na+[*]+[*]K+) and (Na+[*]+[*]K+)/total cation demonstrate that the chemical composition of surface water in the Birim River basin was mainly influenced by carbonate weathering with a small contribution of silicate weathering as shown in Fig.  5 e, f. The plot of Ca 2 +[*]+[*]Mg 2 +/Cl− obviously showed that salinity decrease with increase in Ca 2 +[*]+[*]Mg 2 +, and this phenomenon can be ascribed to ion exchange (Fig.  5 g). Ca 2 +[*]+[*]Mg 2 +/HCO 3 − plot (Fig.  5 h) revealed a horizontal trend line, signifying that Ca 2 +[*]+[*]Mg 2 +/HCO 3 − ratio does not alter during the increase of HCO 3 −. Thus, the contribution of Ca 2 +[*]+[*]Mg 2 + and HCO 3 − are from different sources. Enrichment of HCO 3 − and depletion of Ca 2 +[*]+[*]Mg 2 + may be ascribed to cation exchange. The scatter diagram of Ca 2 +[*]+[*]Mg 2 + versus total cations revealed that the data falls below the 1 : 1 trend line, which demonstrates an increased contribution of Na+ and K+ as TDS increases (Fig.  5 i).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe lipopeptaibol trichogin GA IV is a 10 amino acid-long residue and α-aminoisobutyric acid-rich {{antibiotic}} peptide of fungal origin. TOAC (2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine- 1 -oxyl- 4 -amino- 4 -carboxylic acid) spin-labeled analogs of this membrane active peptide {{were investigated}} in hydrated bilayers of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine by electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy and pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR). Since, the ESEEM of the spin label {{appears to be}} strongly dependent {{on the presence of}} water molecules penetrated into the membrane, this phenomenon was used to study the location of this peptide in the membrane. This was achieved by comparing the ESEEM spectra for peptides labeled at different positions along the amino acid sequence with spectra known for lipids with spin labels at different positions along the hydrocarbon chain. To increase the ESEEM amplitude and to distinguish the hydrogen nuclei of water from lipid protons, membranes were hydrated with deuterated water. The PELDOR spectroscopy technique was chosen to study peptide aggregation and to determine the mutual distance distribution of the spin-labeled peptides in the membrane. The location of the peptide in the membrane and its aggregation state were found to be dependent on the peptide concentration. At a low peptide/lipid <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> (<b>less</b> <b>than</b> 1 : 100) the nonaggregated peptide chain of the trichogin molecules lie parallel to the membrane surface, with TOAC at the 4 th residue located near the 9 th– 11 th carbon positions of the sn- 2 lipid chain. Increasing this ratio up to 1 : 20 leads to a change in peptide orientation, with the N-terminus of the peptide buried deeper into membrane. Under these conditions peptide aggregates are formed with a mean aggregate number of about N= 2. The aggregates are further characterized by a broad range of intermolecular distances (1. 5 – 4 nm) between the labels at the N-terminal residues. The major population exhibits a distance of ∼ 2. 5 nm, which is of the same order as the length of the helical peptide.

The diol/dimolybdenum adducts have diagnostic CID spectra whose sign correlates with the absolute configuration of the organic substrate. It is demonstrated that, in DMSO solution, the acetate ligands of [Mo- 2 (OAc) (4) ] dissociate {{to a large extent}} under the action of the dissolved water, yielding acetic acid and a poly-hydrated dimolybdenum species.

The binding {{was determined by}} ultrafiltration. Some of the experiments were repeated {{with the use of}} equilibrium dialysis in order to strengthen the results. Irrespective of the method used, all ligands bind to one high-affinity binding site with an association constant in the range 10 (4) - 10 (6) M- 1. High-affinity binding of the following pair of ligands took place independently: warfarin-Phenol Red, warfarin-diazepam, warfarin-digitoxin and digitoxin-diazepam. Simultaneous binding of warfarin and salicylate led to a mutual decrease in binding of one another, as did simultaneous binding of digitoxin and Phenol Red. Both effects could be accounted for by a coupling constant. The coupling constant is the factor by which the primary association constants are affected; in these examples of anti-co-operativity the factor has a value between 0 and 1. In the first example it was calculated to be 0. 8 and in the latter 0. 5. Finally, digitoxin and salicylate were found to compete for a common high-affinity binding site. The present findings support the proposal of four separate primary binding sites for warfarin, digitoxin (and salicylate), diazepam and Phenol Red.

Scapolite separates were analyzed for Cl, Br, and major oxide concentrations using electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) and micro-X-ray fluorescence (XRFM) spectrometry. Chlorine was extracted from the scapolite separates via pyrohydrolysis and then analysed for their stable Cl isotope compositions by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). All samples of scapolite investigated in this study are marialitic in composition. One of the scapolites from the Gruvberget deposit (IOCG-PS) had a Cl/Br <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> of 2, 363, which is the highest amongst all scapolites reported in the literature to date.

Elemental sulphur (S) and ammonium sulphate ((NH 4) (2) SO 4) were used as additives to convert the alkali chlorides (mainly KCl) to less corrosive alkali sulphates.

The importance {{of the presence of}} either SO 2 or SO 3 for gas phase sulphation of KCl is also discussed. Ammonium sulphate performed significantly better than elemental sulphur. A more efficient sulphation of gaseous KCl was achieved with (NH 4) (2) SO 4 even when the S/Cl <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> was <b>less</b> <b>than</b> half compared to sulphur.

In this context, the effect of oxalic acid and pH on iron reduction by a biomimetic fungal chelator and on the adsorption/desorption of iron to/from wood was investigated. The results presented in this work indicate that at pH 2. 0 and 4. 5 and in the presence of oxalic acid, the phenolate chelator 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid (2, 3 -DHBA) is capable of reducing ferric iron only when the iron is complexed with oxalate to form Fe mono-oxalate (Fe(C(2) O(4)) (+)). Within the pH range tested in this work, this complex formation occurs when the oxalate:Fe(3 +) <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> is <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 20 (pH 2. 0) or <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 10 (pH 4. 5). When aqueous ferric iron was passed through a column packed with milled red spruce (Picea rubens) wood equilibrated at pH 2. 0 and 4. 5. it was observed that ferric iron binds to wood at pH 4. 5 but not at pH 2. 0, and the bound iron could then be released by application of oxalic acid at pH 4. 5. The release of bound iron was dependent on the amount of oxalic acid applied in the column. When the amount of oxalate was at least 20 -fold greater than the amount of iron bound to the wood, all bound iron was released. When Fe-oxalate complexes were applied to the milled wood column equilibrated in the pH range of 2 - 4. 5, iron from Fe-oxalate complexes was bound to the wood only when the pH was 3. 6 or higher and the oxalate:Fe(3 +) <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> was <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 10. When 2, 3 -DHBA was evaluated for its ability to release iron bound to the milled wood, it was found that 2, 3 -DHBA possessed a greater affinity for ferric iron than the wood as 2, 3 -DHBA was capable of releasing the ferric iron bound to the wood in the pH range 3. 6 - 5. 5. These results further the understanding of the mechanisms employed by brown-rot fungi in wood biodegradation processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, incorporation of nitrogen into the crystalline lattices of transition metals is thermodynamically unfavorable at atmospheric pressure; most of the known transition metal nitrides are nitrogen-deficient with <b>molar</b> <b>ratios</b> of N:metal <b>less</b> <b>than</b> a unity. In this work, we have formulated a high-pressure route for the synthesis of a nitrogen-rich molybdenum nitride through a solid-state ion-exchange reaction. The newly discovered nitride, 3 R–MoN 2, adopts a rhombohedral R 3 m structure, isotypic with MoS 2. This new nitride exhibits catalytic activities that are three times more active than the traditional catalyst MoS 2 for the hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene and {{more than twice as}} high in the selectivity to hydrogenation.

40|$|The SNRB{trademark} {{test program}} {{demonstrated}} {{the feasibility of}} controlling multiple emissions from a coal-fired boiler in a single processing unit. The degree of emissions removals for SO{sub 2 }, NO{sub x}, and particulates all exceeded the project goals. A high degree of removal for HAPs was also achieved. The SNRB system offers low space requirements, control of multiple pollutants, and operating flexibility. The pneumatic SO{sub 2 } sorbent and ammonia injection systems {{are expected to have}} high reliability because of their mechanical simplicity. Despite these advantages, the SNRB process may not be an economic choice for applications involving SO{sub 2 } removals above about 85 %. For lower levels of SO{sub 2 } removal, the projected economics for SNRB appear to be more favorable than those of existing processes which involve separate units for the same degree of control for SO{sub 2 }, NO{sub x}, and particulates. Specific findings are summarized as follows: (1) SO{sub 2 } removal of 85 - 90 % was achieved at a calcium utilization of 40 - 45 %, representing a significant improvement in performance over other dry lime injection processes. (2) When firing 3 - 4 % sulfur coal, compliance with the 1990 CAAA Phase I SO{sub 2 } emissions limit of 2. 5 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu was achieved with a Ca/S <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> of <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 1. 0. For the Phase II SO{sub 2 } emissions limit of 1. 2 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu, compliance was achieved with a Ca/S <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> as low as 1. 5. Phase II compliance is the more relevant emissions limit. (3) When using NaHCO{sub 3 } as the sorbent, the Phase II SO{sub 2 } emissions limit was achieved at a Na{sub 2 }/S <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> of <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 2. 0 (NSR < 1. 0). (4) Compliance with the Phase I NO{sub x} emissions limit of 0. 45 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu for Group 1 boilers was achieved at an NH{sub 3 }/NO{sub x} ratio of 0. 85, with an ammonia slip of 5 ppm or less. (5) Particulate collection efficiency averaged 99. 9 %, corresponding to an average emissions rate of 0. 018 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu. This is significantly lower than the NSPS value of 0. 03 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu. The high-temperature baghouse design incorporating an SCR catalyst for NO{sub x} reduction was demonstrated successfully. The technology is ready for commercial application. The key feature of the technology is control of SO{sub 2 }, NO{sub x}, and particulates in a single process unit. However, this limits its commercial market to applications requiring control of all three components. Also, although the testing demonstrated greater than 90 % SO{sub 2 } capture, this was achieved at high sorbent/sulfur ratios. For applications requiring a high percentage of sulfur removal, a modern conventional FGD unit with LNBs for NO{sub x} control may be the preferred option...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report the}} {{combined}} effects of phospholipase C (PLC), a pronucleating factor, and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), an antinucleating factor, in solutions of model bile. Results indicate that apo A-I inhibits cholesterol nucleation from unilamellar lecithin vesicles by two mechanisms. Initially, inhibition {{is achieved by}} apo A-I shielding of hydrophobic diacylglycerol (DAG) moieties so as to prevent vesicle aggregation. Protection via shielding is temporary. It is lost when the DAG/apo A-I <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> exceeds a critical value. Subsequently, apo A-I forms small (∼ 5 - 15 nm) complexes with lecithin and cholesterol that coexist with lipid-stabilized (400 - 800 nm) DAG oil droplets. This microstructural transition from vesicles to complexes avoids nucleation of cholesterol crystals and is a newly discovered mechanism by which apo A-I serves as an antinucleating agent in bile. The critical value at which a microstructural transition occurs depends on binding of apo A-I and so varies with the cholesterol mole fraction of vesicles. Aggregation of small, unilamellar, egg lecithin vesicles (SUVs) with varying cholesterol composition (0 - 60 mol %) was monitored {{for a range of}} apo A-I concentrations (2 to 89 µg/mL). Suppression of aggregation persists so long as the DAG-to-bound-apo A-I <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> is <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 100.

30|$|Here, a {{coefficient}} {{of the hydrogen}} transfer parameter (CHT) was proposed to quantitatively analyze the degree of the hydrogen transfer reaction as reported in a few open literatures in which the CHT {{was defined as the}} ratio of the weight percentages between paraffin and olefin in LPG [3, 26]. Higher CHT indicated lower secondary cracking activity of liquid products especially gasoline and gasoline yields. Although the LAS amount was reduced after Mg doping when Mg/Al <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> was <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 1.0, the pre-cracking of VGO was enhanced due to the decreased activity of nonselective hydrogen transfer reactions which was reflected in the low yield of coke. In addition, the basic sites of MgO exhibited high hydrogen capacity that contributed to the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen [12, 27]. However, the Zn/Mg 0.5 Al 2 O 3 had a higher CHT of 0.74 than that of Zn/Mg 1.0 Al 2 O 3 (CHT =  0.62) although the latter had higher Mg content. Therefore, the analysis of comparative results of Zn/Mg 0.5 Al 2 O 3 and Zn/Mg 1.0 Al 2 O 3 indicated that only combining with the Lewis acidity could the high activity of hydrogen transfer be achieved [2, 11]. However, the excess Mg on additives suppressed the secondary cracking of gasoline and diesel when Mg/Al <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> was more than 1.0. Hence, the higher CTO ratio was needed to achieve the same conversion level that led to higher coke yield and yields of gasoline and diesel.|$|R

The composition and bacterial mutagenicity {{of the product}} tars were measured. The presence of orgmic chlorine was found to affect both pyrolysis product tar composition and total tar muagenicity. Pyrolysis {{in the absence of}} chlorine produced tars whose bacterial mutagenicity was found to be largely due to the presence of cyclopenta[cdlpyrene, fluoranthene, and benzolalpyrene. Small amounts of chlorine inthe fuel (i. e., Cl/H <b>molar</b> <b>ratios</b> of <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 3) enhanced the formation of highly condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (including cyclopentalcdlpyrene) and increased tar mutagenicity. LIarger amounts of organic chlorine (Cl/H ratios of between 0. 3 and 0. 6) resulted in significant yields of mono- and dichlorinated aromatics and higher levels of tarmutagenicity, which could not be accounted for by the presence of mutagens produced by pyrolysis in the absence of chlorine. Furthermore, unlike tars containing little or no chlorine, tars containing aryl chlorine were more mutagenic in the absence of added enzymes (intended tomimicin woo m ln o n) than in their presence. ehypothesizethat least one ofthe chlorinated aromatic products is strongly mutagenic. Two specific conditions that gave notably different results were a) the lowtemperature (ixe, below 1400 K) pyrolysis of otho-dichlorobenzene, which produced tri- and tetrachlorinated biphenyls almost exclusively; and b) the chlorine-rich pyrolysis of trichloroethylene, during which mostly perchloroaromatics were formed. Neither of these tars was found to mutate bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Polymeric {{coatings}} {{which allow}} the effective control of biointerfacial interactions and cellular responses are of increasing {{interest in a}} range of biomedical applications in vitro and in vivo such as cell culture tools, biosensors and implantable medical devices. A variety of coating strategies have been developed to gain control over cell-surface interactions but many of them are limited with respect to their function and transferability between different substrate materials. Here, our aim was to establish an easily transferable coating that reduces non-specific cell-surface interactions to a minimum {{while at the same time}} presenting functional groups which allow for the subsequent immobilisation of bioactive signals. To achieve this, we have applied an allylamine plasma polymer coating followed by the covalent immobilisation of a macro-initiator providing iniferter functional groups. Subsequent controlled free radical graft polymerisation using the monomers acrylamide and acrylic acid in different <b>molar</b> <b>ratios</b> resulted in highly uniform polymer coatings. Non-specific cell attachment was significantly reduced on coatings representing <b>molar</b> <b>ratios</b> of <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 10 % acrylic acid. At the same time we have demonstrated the suitability of these coatings for the subsequent covalent binding of bioactive compounds carrying amine functional groups using the label 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethylamine. Successful surface modifications were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and profilometry. The cellular response was evaluated using HeLa cell attachment experiments for up to 24 hours. We expect that the coating platform established in this study will be translated into a number of biomedical applications, including applications in implantable devices and regenerative medicine...|$|R
30|$|For the {{simulation}} results of citric acid-coated Ag@Au spheres, all the particles were immersed in cyclohexane, {{leading to a}} three-layered sphere model. According to TEM images of the materials, the initial parameters were set at an Au core size of 532  nm. In the simulated model, as the Au:Ag+ ratio progressed from 1 : 0 to 1 : 2.36, the spectrum showed two characteristic peaks. With increasing particle size, the plasmon resonance bands gradually blueshifted and the absorption intensity increased with the increasing Ag ratio until only one peak could be observed, consistent with the experimental results obtained (Fig.  5). Changes in the peak positions and absorption intensity in both experimental and simulated spectra were influenced {{by an increase in}} Ag shell thickness around Au NPs following an increase in the Ag ratio. When the Au:Ag <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> was <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 1 : 0.33, only one absorption peak was observed. With a relative increase in Ag, two plasmon resonance bands appeared, representing the typical plasmon resonance absorption of Ag-Au core-shell NPs as described by Murphy et al. [6]. Finally, with high Ag concentrations, only the characteristic peak of Ag could be observed. The reducing ability of Au NPs is weaker than that of Ag NPs, and therefore Au NPs could not be oxidized by Ag+ to form Ag NPs when AgNO 3 was added to the Au seed suspension. In fact, Ag NPs were formed by PSSMA reduction of AgNO 3 {{on the surface of the}} Au seed through electrostatic adsorption.|$|R

40|$|Serpentine {{soils are}} {{weathered}} products {{of a range}} of ultramafic rocks composed of ferromagnesian silicates. Serpentine more accurately refers to a group of minerals, including antigorite, chrysotile, and lizardite, in hydrothermally altered ultramafic rocks. Common ultramafic rock types include peridotites (dunite, wehrlite, harzburgite, lherzolite) and the secondary alteration products formed by their hydration within the Earth’s crust, including serpentinite, the primary source of serpentine soil. Serpentine soils are generally deficient in plant essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur; have a calcium-to-magnesium (Ca:Mg) <b>molar</b> <b>ratio</b> of <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 1; and have elevated levels of heavy metals such as nickel, cobalt, and chromium. Although physical features of serpentine soils can vary considerably from site to site and within a site, serpentine soils are often found in open, steep landscapes with substrates that are generally shallow and rocky, often with a reduced capacity for moisture retention. Due to the intense selective pressure generated by such stressful edaphic conditions, serpentine soils promote speciation and the evolution of serpentine endemism, contributing to unique biotas worldwide, including floras with high rates of endemism and species with disjunct distributions. The biota of serpentine soils has contributed greatly to the development of ecological and evolutionary theory, {{as well as to the}} study of the genetics of adaptation and speciation. Plants growing on serpentine soils also provide genetic material for phytoremediation and phytomining operations. Habitats with serpentine soils are undergoing drastic changes due to ever-expanding development, deforestation,mining for heavy metals and asbestos, exotic-species invasions, climate change, and atmospheric deposition of previously limiting nutrients such as nitrogen. Such changes can have drastic impacts on serpentine floras and affect bacteria, fungi, and fauna associated with serpentine plants and soils. Habitats with serpentine soils provide ample opportunities for conservation- and restoration-oriented research directed at finding ways to better manage these biodiversity hotspots...|$|R

Analysis of the distribution of the particles by size measured in the course of aggregation showed that the initial stage of the aggregation process was the stage of formation of the start aggregates with a hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of about 90 nm. When studying the effect of �-crystallin on the rate of DTT-induced aggregation of insulin, it was demonstrated that low concentrations of �-crystallin dramatically accelerated the aggregation process, whereas high concentrations of �-crystallin suppressed insulin aggregation.
