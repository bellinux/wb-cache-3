5|$|In 1994, {{several groups}} were {{involved}} {{in an attempt to}} relocate the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from Minneapolis, Minnesota to New Orleans, Louisiana. The proposed relocation would have been the second involving a Minneapolis-based franchise in the span of two years, as Minneapolis had lost its National Hockey League (NHL) franchise to Dallas in 1993. Timberwolves owners Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner were considering selling the team due to problems with the <b>mortgage</b> <b>on</b> the Target Center, the team's arena that had been built only four years earlier as part of Minneapolis' 1989 entry into the NBA. The events of the attempted relocation resulted in Glen Taylor, businessman and former Minnesota State Senator, purchasing the team and keeping it in Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, {{the protagonist}} {{and a female}} {{accomplice}} rent a home like the one Cox and Hauck rented in Atlanta. The character then opens accounts at several banks in the area {{so that he can}} use them for money laundering purposes, which Cox did. Then, Cox, like the character in the manuscript, forged a document, claiming that the <b>mortgage</b> <b>on</b> the home—which he did not even own—was paid off. The character in the manuscript then contacted lenders, and told them he owned the property outright. Cox is in prison for this same crime.|$|E

5|$|That July, the RTC {{took out}} a $385,000 <b>mortgage</b> <b>on</b> the Theatre from two banks, the Rondout Savings Bank and the Ulster Savings Bank. After being run by the Cacchios for 61years, the RTC assumed {{ownership}} of the Theatre on August19, 2010. Announcing its intent to show {{the same kind of}} movies that the Theatre screened during the Cacchio's tenure, the group also agreed to continue exhibiting live acts, continue participating in the Woodstock Film Festival, renovate the building, and add digital equipment. The second and third floors may be renovated and used for offices, and as space for rehearsals and performances.|$|E
5|$|A year later, in October 1889, Eddy {{closed the}} Massachusetts Metaphysical College; {{according}} to Bates and Dittemore, {{the state attorney}} was investigating colleges that were fraudulently graduating medical students. She also foreclosed the <b>mortgage</b> <b>on</b> the land in Boston the church had purchased, then purchased it herself for $5,000 through a middle man, though it was worth considerably more. She told the church they could have the land for their building on condition they formally dissolve the church; this was apparently intended to quash internal rebellions that had been bothering her. The following year she dissolved the National Christian Science Association. Wilson writes that the dissolutions allowed her to create a central church controlled by a five-person board of directors that answered only to her, which gave the church a stability that helped it survive her death.|$|E
5|$|Frazee {{sold the}} rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a {{baseball}} player. The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a <b>mortgage</b> <b>on</b> Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner {{that he was getting}} the worse end of the bargain. Cynics have suggested that Barrow may have played a larger role in the Ruth sale, as less than a year after, he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee. The $100,000 price included $25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash.|$|E

5|$|Jennings retired {{with his}} wife, Clarissa, {{to his home}} in Charlestown. Tipton may have felt it had been mistake to force Jennings out of public service and hoped that work would force him to give up alcohol. In 1831 Tipton secured Jennings an {{appointment}} to negotiate a treaty with native tribes in northern Indiana. Jennings attended the negotiations of the Treaty of Tippecanoe, but the delegation failed in their attempt. Afterwards, Jennings returned to his farm, where his health steadily declined. He continued drinking alcohol, spending considerable time a local tavern, and was frequently discovered sleeping in streets or in roadside ditches. Jenning's alcoholism worsened {{to the point where he}} was no longer able to tend his farm. Without a steady income Jennings's creditors began moving to seize his estate. In 1832 Tipton acquired the <b>mortgage</b> <b>on</b> Jennings's farm and enlisted the help of a local financier, James Lanier, to acquire the debts on Jennings's other holdings. Tipton allowed Jennings to remain on his mortgaged farm for the remainder of Jennings's life and encouraged Lanier to grant the same permission.|$|E
5|$|On {{behalf of}} Stern, in January 1973 Heidemann photographed the Carin II, a yacht that {{formerly}} belonged to Göring. The boat {{was in a}} poor state of repair and expensive to maintain, but Heidemann took a <b>mortgage</b> <b>on</b> his Hamburg flat and purchased it. While researching {{the history of the}} yacht, Heidemann interviewed Göring's daughter, Edda, after which the couple began an affair. Through this relationship and his ownership of the boat he was introduced to a circle of former Nazis. He began to hold parties on the Carin II, with the former SS generals Karl Wolff and Wilhelm Mohnke as the guests of honour. Wolff and Mohnke were witnesses at Heidemann's wedding to his third wife in 1979; the couple went on honeymoon to South America accompanied by Wolff, where they met more ex-Nazis, including Walter Rauff and Klaus Barbie, who were both wanted in the West for war crimes.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 U.S. Senate {{election}} in Massachusetts, Kennedy faced his first serious challenger, the young, telegenic, and very well-funded Mitt Romney. Romney ran {{as a successful}} entrepreneur and Washington outsider with a strong family image and moderate stands on social issues, while Kennedy was saddled not only with his recent past but the 25th anniversary of Chappaquiddick and his first wife Joan seeking a renegotiated divorce settlement. By mid-September 1994, polls showed the race to be even. Kennedy's campaign ran short on money, and belying his image as endlessly wealthy, {{he was forced to}} take out a second <b>mortgage</b> <b>on</b> his Virginia home. Kennedy responded with a series of attack ads, which focused both on Romney's shifting political views and on the treatment of workers at a paper products plant owned by Romney's Bain Capital. Kennedy's new wife Vicki proved to be a strong asset in campaigning. Kennedy and Romney held a widely watched late October debate without a clear winner, but by then Kennedy had pulled ahead in polls and stayed ahead afterward. In the November election, despite a very bad outcome for the Democratic Party nationally, Kennedy won re-election by a 58percent to 41percent margin, the closest re-election race of his career.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of <b>mortgages</b> <b>on</b> {{consumer}} debt and on debt on durable goods. We first present a stylized model in which an outstanding debt, representing mortgages, affects positively consumer debt, and debt on durable goods. The model is empirically tested for the U. S. using PSID 2005 wave. Our results are striking. First, we find strong evidence supporting a positive association between mortgage loans and consumer debts, regardless of the measures used, the control variables used, and the methods used. Second, {{we find that the}} effects of <b>mortgages</b> <b>on</b> the debt on durable goods are in general smaller than the effects of <b>mortgages</b> <b>on</b> consumer debt. Third, our distributional analysis reveals that the effects monotonically decrease as the quantile increases. Finally, our results are also confirmed by the results using the U. K. data.
