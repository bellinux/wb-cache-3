5|$|<b>Mercury</b> {{poisoning}} {{can result}} from exposure to water-soluble forms of <b>mercury</b> (such as mercuric chloride or methylmercury), by inhalation of <b>mercury</b> vapor, or by ingesting any form of <b>mercury.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 2010 {{concluded}} that {{the main source of}} the <b>mercury</b> is likely worldwide industry, rather than local sources. As water levels rise and fall, <b>mercury</b> accumulation does as well. About 16 percent of the <b>mercury</b> comes in from rivers, and 84 percent comes from the atmosphere in a non-toxic, inorganic form. The non-toxic <b>mercury</b> is converted into toxic methyl <b>mercury</b> by bacteria which thrive in the more saline water of the North arm affected by the causeway.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} {{geometric}} mean urine <b>mercury</b> concentration identified a previously unrecognized source of exposure (skin care products) to inorganic <b>mercury</b> among New York City residents. Population-based biomonitoring {{also showed that}} <b>mercury</b> concentration levels are higher in consumers of seafood and fish meals.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1955-56 season, the <b>Mercurys</b> {{played some}} home games in Marion, Ohio at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum, hence being {{known as the}} Toledo-Marion <b>Mercurys.</b> The <b>Mercurys</b> split home games between arenas again for the 1959-60 season. The Toledo-St. Louis <b>Mercurys</b> played some home games in St. Louis, Missouri at the St. Louis Arena.|$|R
50|$|The jumping-Jupiter {{model can}} {{reproduce}} the eccentricity and inclination of <b>Mercury's</b> orbit. <b>Mercury's</b> eccentricity is excited when it crosses a secular resonance with Jupiter. When relativistic effects are included, <b>Mercury's</b> precession rate is faster, which reduces {{the impact of}} this resonance crossing, and results in a smaller eccentricity similar to its current value. <b>Mercury's</b> inclination {{may be the result of}} it or Venus crossing a secular resonance with Uranus.|$|R
25|$|The Owen Sound Kings changed names {{again in}} 1980, {{becoming}} the Owen Sound Rutherford <b>Mercurys,</b> {{known simply as}} the <b>Mercurys.</b> This lasted until 1983.|$|R
5|$|An old style <b>mercury</b> {{barometer}} {{consists of}} a vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with <b>mercury,</b> and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the <b>mercury</b> level {{at the center of}} the tube is higher than at the edges, making the upper surface of the <b>mercury</b> dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column of <b>mercury</b> would be slightly lower if the top surface of the <b>mercury</b> were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of <b>mercury.</b> Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time <b>mercury</b> was found in local fish at such high levels that {{consumption}} warnings were posted for fishermen. A Florida panther was found dead with levels of <b>mercury</b> high enough to kill a human. Scientists found that power plants and incinerators using fossil fuels were expelling <b>mercury</b> into the atmosphere, and it fell as rain or dust during droughts. The naturally occurring bacteria that reduce sulfur in the Everglades ecosystem were transforming the <b>mercury</b> into methylmercury, and it was bioaccumulating through the food chain. Stricter emissions standards helped lower <b>mercury</b> coming from power plants and incinerators, which in turn lowered <b>mercury</b> levels found in animals, though {{they continue to be}} a concern.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1558, {{with the}} {{invention}} of the patio process to extract silver from ore using <b>mercury,</b> <b>mercury</b> became an essential resource in the economy of Spain and its American colonies. <b>Mercury</b> was used to extract silver from the lucrative mines in New Spain and Peru. Initially, the Spanish Crown's mines in Almadén in Southern Spain supplied all the <b>mercury</b> for the colonies. <b>Mercury</b> deposits were discovered in the New World, and more than 100,000 tons of <b>mercury</b> were mined from the region of Huancavelica, Peru, over the course of three centuries following the discovery of deposits there in 1563. The patio process and later pan amalgamation process continued to create great demand for <b>mercury</b> to treat silver ores until the late 19th century.|$|E
50|$|Messenger of the Gods: The Singles is a {{compilation}} album of Freddie <b>Mercury's</b> singles. It was released {{three days before}} the 70th anniversary of <b>Mercury's</b> birth.|$|R
50|$|The music video, {{produced}} {{after his}} death, was an epitaph, as <b>Mercury's</b> actual written song notes were displayed alongside imagery and clips of <b>Mercury's</b> past performances.|$|R
5000|$|There {{have been}} various ways that <b>Mercury's</b> {{magnetic}} field has been measured. In general, the inferred equivalent internal dipole field is smaller when estimated {{on the basis}} of magnetospheric size and shape (~150-200 nT R3). Recent Earth-based radar measurements of <b>Mercury's</b> rotation revealed a slight rocking motion explaining that <b>Mercury's</b> core is at least partially molten, implying that iron [...] "snow" [...] helps maintain the magnetic field. The MESSENGER spacecraft will make more than 500 million measurements of <b>Mercury's</b> magnetic field, using its sensitive magnetometer.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the health}} effects of <b>mercury</b> exposure, {{industrial}} and commercial uses are regulated in many countries. The World Health Organization, OSHA, and NIOSH all treat <b>mercury</b> as an occupational hazard, and have established specific occupational exposure limits. Environmental releases and disposal of <b>mercury</b> are regulated in the U.S. primarily by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E
5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate <b>mercury</b> in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of <b>mercury.</b> Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of <b>mercury</b> than others. As <b>mercury</b> and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the <b>mercury</b> level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of <b>mercury</b> that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. <b>Mercury</b> poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E
5|$|Gold {{and silver}} mining. Historically, <b>mercury</b> was used {{extensively}} in hydraulic gold mining {{in order to}} help the gold to sink through the flowing water-gravel mixture. Thin gold particles may form mercury-gold amalgam and therefore increase the gold recovery rates. Large-scale use of <b>mercury</b> stopped in the 1960s. However, <b>mercury</b> is still used in small scale, often clandestine, gold prospecting. It is estimated that 45,000 metric tons of <b>mercury</b> used in California for placer mining have not been recovered. <b>Mercury</b> was also used in silver mining.|$|E
50|$|In 1947, {{the team}} donned the <b>Mercurys</b> moniker. They {{made it back}} to the OHA Senior A final again in 1951 to beat a team from Sarnia 4-games-to-2. The <b>Mercurys</b> pushed on to the Allan Cup final where they faced the Fort Frances Canadians. The Canadians drove all the way from Fort Frances, Ontario on the Manitoba border to compete with the <b>Mercurys</b> at the Centennial Arena. The <b>Mercurys</b> won game one and the Canadians pulled even in game two. Game three went to the <b>Mercurys</b> and again the Canadians {{answered}} in game four. With the momentum, the Canadians broke the pattern and won game five to take their first series lead. The <b>Mercurys</b> had their backs to the wall, with one more loss the National Championship would go to Fort Frances. In game six, the <b>Mercurys</b> came out blazing and defeated the Canadians 7-4 to force a game seven. The seventh game was low scoring, but this played to Owen Sound's favour as they took the game 3-1, the series 4-games-to-3, and the Canadian Senior National Championship. The team's championship photo can be seen at the Bayshore Community Centre's Sports Hall of Fame.|$|R
50|$|He {{worked on}} {{celestial}} mechanics and {{especially on the}} three body problem and the perihelion precession of <b>Mercury's</b> orbit. The problem of explaining <b>Mercury's</b> orbit was solved by Albert Einstein's general relativity theory.|$|R
25|$|On October 5, 2011, the {{scientific}} results obtained by MESSENGER {{during its first}} six terrestrial months in <b>Mercury's</b> orbit were presented {{in a series of}} papers at the European Planetary Science Congress in Nantes, France. Among the discoveries presented were the unexpectedly high concentrations of magnesium and calcium found on <b>Mercury's</b> nightside, and the fact that <b>Mercury's</b> magnetic field is offset far {{to the north of the}} planet's center.|$|R
5|$|In China and Tibet, <b>mercury</b> use {{was thought}} to prolong life, heal fractures, and {{maintain}} generally good health, although it is now known that exposure to <b>mercury</b> vapor leads to serious adverse health effects. The first emperor of China, Qín Shǐ Huáng Dì—allegedly buried in a tomb that contained rivers of flowing <b>mercury</b> on {{a model of the}} land he ruled, representative of the rivers of China—was killed by drinking a <b>mercury</b> and powdered jade mixture formulated by Qin alchemists (causing liver failure, <b>mercury</b> poisoning, and brain death) who intended to give him eternal life. Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun, the second Tulunid ruler of Egypt (r. 884–896), known for his extravagance and profligacy, reportedly built a basin filled with <b>mercury,</b> on which he would lie on top of air-filled cushions and be rocked to sleep.|$|E
5|$|In the European Union, the {{directive}} on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (see RoHS) bans <b>mercury</b> from certain electrical and electronic products, and limits {{the amount of}} <b>mercury</b> in other products to less than 1000 ppm. There are restrictions for <b>mercury</b> concentration in packaging (the limit is 100 ppm for sum of <b>mercury,</b> lead, hexavalent chromium and cadmium) and batteries (the limit is 5 ppm). In July 2007, the European Union also banned <b>mercury</b> in non-electrical measuring devices, such as thermometers and barometers. The ban applies to new devices only, and contains exemptions for the health care sector and a two-year grace period for manufacturers of barometers.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{is one of}} many {{substitutes}} for <b>mercury</b> in alkaline batteries to prevent the zinc from corroding and releasing hydrogen gas. Indium is added to some dental amalgam alloys to decrease the surface tension of the <b>mercury</b> and allow for less <b>mercury</b> and easier amalgamation.|$|E
50|$|The 1953-54 season saw the <b>Mercurys</b> {{push back}} to their fourth {{straight}} league final. In their way was the Stratford Indians. Unlike 1952, the <b>Mercurys</b> {{took it to the}} Indians and swept the series 4-games-to-none to win their second league title in four seasons. The <b>Mercurys</b> did not make it to the Allan Cup final in 1954, as the Eastern Championship went to the Northern Ontario Hockey Association's Sudbury Wolves.|$|R

50|$|Later, Ingoldsby played senior hockey for the Toronto Staffords in 1945 and 1946. Immediately after, from 1947 till 1953, {{he played}} for the Owen Sound <b>Mercurys.</b> He won the Allan Cup with the <b>Mercurys</b> in 1951.|$|R
5|$|Infrared {{sensitive}} {{semiconductor material}} is formed by alloying tellurium with cadmium and <b>mercury</b> to form <b>mercury</b> cadmium telluride.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mercury</b> also {{enters into}} the {{environment}} through the improper disposal (e.g., land filling, incineration) of certain products. Products containing <b>mercury</b> include: auto parts, batteries, fluorescent bulbs, medical products, thermometers, and thermostats. Due to health concerns (see below), toxics use reduction efforts are cutting back or eliminating <b>mercury</b> in such products. For example, the amount of <b>mercury</b> sold in thermostats in the United States decreased from 14.5 tons in 2004 to 3.9 tons in 2007.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mercury</b> and cadmium are toxic and {{may cause}} {{environmental}} damage if they enter rivers or rain water. This {{may result in}} contaminated crops {{as well as the}} bioaccumulation of <b>mercury</b> in a food chain leading to an increase in illnesses caused by <b>mercury</b> and cadmium poisoning.|$|E
40|$|From Mariner 10 third {{encounter}} UV data, a value of. 00045 {{was calculated}} as {{the fraction of}} the solar wind He++ flux intercepted and captured by <b>Mercury's</b> magnetosphere if the observed He atmosphere is maintained by the solar wind. If an internal source for He prevails, the corresponding upper bound for the global outgassing rate {{is estimated to be}} 4. 5 x 10 to the 22 nd power per sec. A surface temperature distribution was used which satisfies the heat equation over <b>Mercury's</b> entire surface using Mariner 10 determined mean surface thermal characteristics. The means stand off distance of <b>Mercury's</b> magnetopause averaged over <b>Mercury's</b> orbit was also used...|$|R

5|$|<b>Mercury</b> {{does not}} react with most acids, such as dilute sulfuric acid, {{although}} oxidizing acids such as concentrated sulfuric acid and nitric acid or aqua regia dissolve it to give sulfate, nitrate, and chloride. Like silver, <b>mercury</b> reacts with atmospheric hydrogen sulfide. <b>Mercury</b> reacts with solid sulfur flakes, {{which are used}} in <b>mercury</b> spill kits to absorb <b>mercury</b> (spill kits also use activated carbon and powdered zinc).|$|E
5|$|Norway {{enacted a}} total {{ban on the}} use of <b>mercury</b> in the {{manufacturing}} and import/export of <b>mercury</b> products, effective 1 January 2008. In 2002, several lakes in Norway were found to have a poor state of <b>mercury</b> pollution, with an excess of 1µg/g of <b>mercury</b> in their sediment.|$|E
5|$|Research on the {{treatment}} of <b>mercury</b> poisoning is limited. Currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (NAP), British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental <b>mercury,</b> patients were treated with DMSA and NAP. Chelation therapy with both drugs resulted in the mobilization of {{a small fraction of}} the total estimated body <b>mercury.</b> DMSA was able to increase the excretion of <b>mercury</b> to a greater extent than NAP.|$|E
50|$|In fact, the dog {{is looking}} at the hidden knife under <b>Mercury's</b> leg. <b>Mercury's</b> {{movement}} with his knife, from the bottom to the top in a circular way, is highlighting the impression of movement and reinforces the suggested dramatic tension.|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{history of}} <b>Mercury's</b> {{interior}} is examined using {{the model of}} Stevenson et al. (1983), extended to include the effects of tidal heating in <b>Mercury's</b> solid inner core. The implications of <b>Mercury's</b> thermal history {{for the source of}} the planet's magnetic field are discussed. It is shown that the major results of this model are similar to the results obtained with the Stevenson et al. model, except for the addition of inner-core tidal dissipation. It is concluded that the extended model properly characterizes <b>Mercury's</b> internal structure and thermal history, and that the criteria for dynamo generation are not properly satisfied. Alternative explanations, including the possibility of a weak thermoelectric dynamo, are examined...|$|R
50|$|The {{magnetic}} field is about 1.1% {{as strong as}} Earth's. At the Hermean equator, the relative strength of the {{magnetic field}} is around 300 nT, which is weaker than that of Jupiter's moon Ganymede. <b>Mercury's</b> magnetic field is weaker than Earth's because its core had cooled and solidified more quickly than Earth's. Although <b>Mercury's</b> magnetic field is much weaker than Earth's magnetic field, it is still strong enough to deflect the solar wind, inducing a magnetosphere. Because <b>Mercury's</b> magnetic field is weak while the interplanetary magnetic field it interacts with in its orbit is relatively strong, the solar wind dynamic pressure at <b>Mercury′s</b> orbit is also three times larger than at Earth.|$|R
