6000|$|They {{had just}} been {{preparing}} to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves. The one <b>missent</b> must first be attended to; it had been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect: ...|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth {{had been}} a good deal {{disappointed}} in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been <b>missent</b> elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.|$|E
60|$|Margaret always {{maintains}} {{that it was}} a direct inspiration of Providence that took her across the street to see Aunt Beatrice that night. And Aunt Beatrice believes that it was too. But {{the truth of the matter}} is that Margaret was feeling very unhappy, and went over to talk to Aunt Beatrice as the only alternative to a fit of crying. Margaret's unhappiness has nothing further to do with this story, so it may be dismissed with the remark that it did not amount to much, in spite of Margaret's tragical attitude, and was dissipated at once and forever by the arrival of a certain <b>missent</b> letter the next day.|$|E

5000|$|Startup was homesteaded by F.M. Sparling in the 1880s. [...] In 1890 William Wait {{laid out}} a {{townsite}} which he called Wallace, but this caused confusion with mail being <b>missent</b> to Wallace, Idaho, and in 1901 the name was changed to Startup to honor George G. Startup, manager of the Wallace Lumber Company.|$|E
50|$|A Dead Letter Office {{was first}} {{established}} in 1784 for dead and <b>missent</b> letters that had reached London. The bye-letter offices dealt with bye-letters {{and those that}} {{did not go to}} London. No postage was charged for returns, which were made after six months, where an addressee was found. From 1790 a charge was made for returned letter but the time was reduced to two months by John Palmer. Upon hearing of the return charge William Pitt rescinded the charge.|$|E

5000|$|Ocean Ridge {{was founded}} in 1931 as the Town of Boynton Beach, which was {{originally}} part of the Town of Boynton. Major Nathan S. Boynton toured the area in 1894, and established the Boynton Beach Hotel in 1897. The town of Boynton was incorporated in 1920. Due to disputes over beach area property taxes and the Town of Boynton's rising debt load, twelve homes created the Town of Boynton Beach in 1931. But in 1937, the Town Commission called a special emergency meeting over changing Boynton Beach's name, because mail was being <b>missent</b> to Daytona Beach due to the similarities in name. Marion White Bird, the daughter of then Mayor Michael White, suggested the name [...] "Ocean Ridge" [...] and won a contest for choosing a new name. The name was officially changed to [...] "Ocean Ridge" [...] in 1939. Two years later, the Town of Boynton itself changed its name, to [...] "Boynton Beach".|$|E
40|$|Background Laboratory {{results are}} {{essential}} in modern patient treatment, and follow up of test results {{is crucial to}} ensure the quality of patient care. Despite this more than 43 000 lab results were unsigned in the electronic healh record (EHR) at Oslo University Hospital (OUS) in April 2016. One of the main objectives of this study has been to identify the causes of missing signing of test results among physicians involved in patient treatment. Method A questionnaire was used for data collection from a selection of 585 physicians at OUS, of which 182 responded to the survey. Elements from the theory models Leawitt diamond and UTAUT were used to identify possible causation and contribute in analyzing a wide range of variables that may affect the signing of analysis results. Results Among the many reasons why physicians do not sign test results, the study reveals that the organization’s lack of focus on signing is of considerable importance. Other important elements are poor or unsufficient functionality in the journal system, and {{the fact that many of}} the signing tasks end up in an undefined worklist or they are <b>missent</b> to a wrong recipient. However, the main reason for neglecting signing seems to be lack of time. This becomes evident by the respondent’s desire for solutions for auto-signing or help from others to sign, faster computers and EHR, and time for the physician to accomplish signing tasks and follow up test results. Some physicians will not sign according to the intention, but only for appeasement of imposed requirements, giving an uncertain relationship between the signing and the follow-up of test results. Physicians affiliated to outpatient departments find signing more useful than physicians affiliated to inpatient departments. Conclusion Despite the challenges related to signing of test results, the study shows that the vast majority of physicians are relatively familiar with the intention of signing and that most analysis-results are signed. In consequence, signing of test results in EHR is considered to be an appropriate method for quality assurance of test-results follow up...|$|E
