40|$|Reducing grazing {{intensity}} is widely recommended {{as a strategy}} to increase grassland biodiversity through greater sward heterogeneity. Horses are playing an increasing role {{in the management of}} permanent grasslands across Europe, but the effects of horse grazing under contrasting stocking rates have been poorly studied. Here we describe the effects of two contrasted stocking rates (“High” 1. 8 LU ha− 1 vs. “Moderate” 1. 1 LU ha− 1) on sward structure, horse foraging behaviour and performances, and pasture biodiversity in a <b>mesophile</b> <b>grassland</b> of central France. Horses selectively grazed vegetative patches of high nutritive value, especially at the moderate stocking rate (p 270 g animal− 1 d− 1) at the same level in highly and moderately grazed plots despite contrasted herbage biomass and quality. Horses, with their two sets of incisors, created and maintained patches of short grass in a matrix of tall vegetation in both treatments. Consequently, sward structural heterogeneity did not significantly differ between highly and moderately grazed plots, and there was no detectable effect of {{grazing intensity}} on floristic and arthropod diversity over the four-year study. The two stocking rates did however result in a divergent evolution of legumes for which abundance increased at the high stocking rate (p < 0. 05). Abundance of Carabidae and grasshoppers from tall grasslands was higher at the moderate stocking rate (p < 0. 05). We conclude that decreasing stocking rate would only have a marginal effect on grassland biodiversity, while farm performance will be strongly affected by the {{decrease in the number of}} horses per unit area...|$|E
40|$|The {{definition}} of habitats 6230 {{has been reported}} and interpreted {{by a number of}} authors for the European area and Italian environments. In the European literature, the habitats have been described as closed, dry or <b>mesophile</b> perennial Nardus <b>grasslands</b> which are remarkable for a high specific biodiversity, in contrast, Italian manuals and reports empathized the dominance of Nardus stricta in these habitats or its prevalence in conjunction with other acidophilic species. This work was carried out {{to learn more about the}} botanical composition of habitats 6230 in meadows and pastures of the southern Brenta Dolomites and other objectives were to determine the specific biodiversity, abundance of N. stricta, and presence of other acidophilic species; and to study the relationships occurring between these traits...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe French Atlantic marshlands, {{reclaimed}} {{since the}} Middle Age, have been successively used for extensive grazing {{and more recently}} for cereal cultivation from 1970. The soils have acquired specific properties which have been induced by the successive reclaiming and drainage works and by {{the response of the}} clay dominant primary sediments, that is, structure, moisture, and salinity profiles. Based on the whole survey of the Marais Poitevin and Marais de Rochefort and in order to explain the mechanisms of marsh soil behavior, the work focuses on two typical spots: an undrained grassland since at least 1964 and a drained cereal cultivated field. The structure-hydromechanical profiles relationships have been established thanks to the clay matrix shrinkage curve. They are confronted to the hydraulic functioning including the fresh-to-salt water transfers and to the recording of tensiometer profiles. The CE 1 / 5 profiles supply the water geochemical and geophysical data by their better accuracy. Associated to the available water capacity calculation they allow the representation of the parallel evolution of the residual available water capacity profiles and salinity profiles according to the plant growing and rooting from the <b>mesophile</b> systems of <b>grassland</b> to the hygrophile systems of drained fields...|$|R
