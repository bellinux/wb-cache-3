25|$|Grand Theft Auto IV {{has also}} {{prompted}} editing in the Australian (PAL) version, as Rockstar was worried it <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> RC rating. In the American release, sexual encounters with prostitutes occur inside the player's vehicle and the player {{has the ability}} to rotate the camera for a clearer view of what transpires. In the censored Australian version, the camera is fixed behind the vehicle, which rocks from side to side with accompanying audio effects. It is impossible for the player to view the inside of the car. Rockstar later decided to rate the uncut version of the game which went on to receive a MA15+ and a patch was later released for the PS3 and Xbox 360 to uncensor the game.|$|E

By the end of 2001, the show boasted the highest ratings of any children's series on television. Nickelodeon began adding SpongeBob SquarePants to its Monday-through-Thursday prime-time block.

Hillenburg did not expect the show would be very popular even to adults: [...] "I never imagined that it would get to this point. When you set out to do a show about a sponge, you can't anticipate this kind of craze. We just try to make ourselves laugh, then ask if it's appropriate for children.

2500|$|Because the 0.9mm {{thickness}} of the DualDisc CD layer did not conform to Red Book CD Specifications, which called for a layer no less than 1.1mm thick, some CD players could not play the CD side of a DualDisc due to a phenomenon called spherical aberration. [...] As a result, the laser reading the CD side <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> [...] "blurry" [...] picture of the data on the disc — {{the equivalent of a}} human reading a book with glasses of the wrong strength. [...] Engineers tried to get around this by making the pits in the CD layer larger than on a conventional CD. [...] This makes the CD side easier for the laser to read — equivalent to a book using bigger print {{to make it easier to}} see, even if the person's glasses are of the wrong strength. [...] The downside to this, however, is that the playing time for the CD layer of some early DualDiscs decreased from the standard 74 minutes of a conventional CD to around 60 minutes, although this early limitation was later overcome.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the 32 selections {{in each of the}} seven rounds, a total of 32 compensatory picks are awarded to teams based on the players they lost and gained in free agency. [...] Using a proprietary formula, [...] the league defines a class of unrestricted free agents as [...] "compensatory free agents ("CFA"). [...] Teams that have lost more or better compensatory free agents than they signed in the previous year receive picks somewhere in the third through seventh rounds. Teams that gain and lose the same number of players but lose higher-valued players also can be awarded a pick, but only in the seventh round, after the others. Compensatory picks are awarded each year at the NFL annual meeting which is held at the end of March; typically, about three or four weeks before the draft. Compensatory picks may not be traded (however, this will change beginning with the 2017 NFL draft). The placement of the picks is determined by a proprietary formula based on the player's salary, playing time, and postseason honors with his new team, with salary being the primary factor. So, for example, a team that lost a linebacker who signed for $2.5 million per year in free agency <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> sixth-round compensatory pick, while a team that lost a wide receiver who signed for $5 million per year might receive a fourth-round pick. However, the NFL has never revealed the exact formula used to determine allotment of compensatory picks, though observers from outside the NFL have been able to reverse engineer it to some degree of certainty.|$|E

[...] McCartney's voice can be heard sped up underneath West's opening vocals. McCartney originally played his guitar part slower and in a lower key, which West later speeded up for the finished release, thus causing McCartney's voice to sound much higher than its normal tone.
