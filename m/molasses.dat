5|$|Brown sugars are {{granulated}} sugars, either containing residual <b>molasses,</b> or {{with the}} grains deliberately coated with <b>molasses</b> to produce a light- or dark-colored sugar. They are used in baked goods, confectionery, and toffees.|$|E
5|$|Iron is pervasive, but {{particularly}} rich sources of dietary iron include red meat, lentils, beans, poultry, fish, leaf vegetables, watercress, tofu, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and blackstrap <b>molasses.</b> Bread and breakfast cereals are sometimes specifically fortified with iron. Iron in low amounts {{is found in}} <b>molasses,</b> teff, and farina.|$|E
5|$|Meat stews (chicken, {{lamb and}} beef) are cooked with spices, pine nuts herbs like parsley, mint and oregano, onion, tomato sauce or tahini or juices such as {{pomegranate}} <b>molasses,</b> pomegranate juice, pomegranate wine, grape wine, arak, date <b>molasses</b> and tamarind. Peas, chickpeas, white beans, cowpeas or green beans are sometimes also added.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molasses</b> is {{commonly}} used to make rum, and sugar byproducts are used to make ethanol for fuel.|$|E
5|$|Pioneered Grain Spirits: The brand {{redefined the}} spirits space by {{choosing}} grain spirits blended with Scotch malts and not using <b>molasses.</b>|$|E
5|$|As England imposed its {{series of}} acts upon the colonists, {{changes in the}} American colonists' {{purchases}} and trades eventually altered the American diet. Starting with the <b>Molasses</b> Act of 1733, followed by the Sugar Act of 1760, a shift in alcohol consumption occurred. This {{was more than a}} protest against taxation of <b>molasses,</b> the main ingredient in rum production. Whiskey became the spirit of choice for many American colonists who wished to thumb their noses at England. In the northern colonies, whiskey was made with rye, while the southern colonies preferred corn. Rye was seen as a more civilized grain, while corn whiskey was presented as a more patriotic version as it was produced from an indigenous American crop.|$|E
5|$|On 25 March 1778 Lowestoffe {{captured}} the sloop Swan, Daniel Smith, Master. She was of 60 tons, had {{a crew of}} seven men, and was carrying a cargo of <b>molasses.</b>|$|E
5|$|Syrups and treacles are {{dissolved}} invert sugars {{heated to}} develop the characteristic flavors. (Treacles have added <b>molasses.)</b> They are used {{in a range of}} baked goods and confectionery including toffees and licorice.|$|E
5|$|Families {{living in}} the area harvest the grapes {{in the spring and}} summer to produce a variety of {{products}} ranging from raisins, jams and a <b>molasses</b> known as dibs. The Bethlehem area, Beit Jala in particular, and the village of Jifna are known regionally for their apricots and apricot jam as is the Tulkarm area for its olives and olive oil.|$|E
5|$|On 8 February 1779, Lowestoffe {{captured}} the Vigilant, near the Bite (or Bight) of Leogan. The 70 ton sloop was sailing from Dominique to Philadelphia with a cargo of sugar, rum, <b>molasses,</b> coffee, cotton and salt. John English was her master {{and she had}} a crew of five men.|$|E
5|$|Refined {{sugar is}} made from raw sugar that has {{undergone}} a refining process to remove the <b>molasses.</b> Raw sugar is sucrose which is extracted from sugarcane or sugar beet. While raw sugar can be consumed, the refining process removes unwanted tastes and results in refined sugar or white sugar.|$|E
5|$|After its {{victory in}} the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the British Empire was deeply in debt. Looking for new sources of revenue, the British Parliament sought, for the first time, to {{directly}} tax the colonies, beginning with the Sugar Act of 1764. The earlier <b>Molasses</b> Act of 1733, a tax on shipments from the West Indies, had produced hardly any revenue because it was widely bypassed by smuggling, which {{was seen as a}} victimless crime.|$|E
5|$|After the explosion, Bennington was refloated and towed to the Mare Island Navy Yard. Because of {{the extent}} of the damages and the age of the ship, Bennington was not {{repaired}} but was instead decommissioned on 31 October 1905. After five years of inactivity, Bennington was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 10 September 1910 and sold for scrap on 14 November. Bennington was not scrapped but was purchased in 1913 by the Matson Line for use as a <b>molasses</b> barge. She was towed to Honolulu and remained in use there from 1913 until 1924, when she was scuttled off Oahu.|$|E
5|$|Before the Revolution, New Englanders {{consumed}} {{large quantities}} of rum and beer as maritime trade provided relatively {{easy access to the}} goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the distilled spirit of choice as <b>molasses,</b> the main ingredient, was readily available from trade with the West Indies. In the continent's interior, colonists drank whiskey, as they had ready access to corn and rye but did not have good access to sugar cane. However, up until the Revolution, many colonists considered whiskey to be a coarse beverage unfit for human consumption, believing that it caused the poor to become raucous and disorderly.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{and white}} {{granulated}} sugar are 97% to nearly 100% carbohydrates, respectively, with less than 2% water, and no dietary fiber, protein or fat (table). Brown sugar contains a moderate amount of iron (15% of the Reference Daily Intake in a 100 gram amount, see table), but a typical serving of 4 grams (one teaspoon), would provide 15 calories and a negligible amount of iron or any other nutrient. Because brown sugar contains 5–10% <b>molasses</b> reintroduced during processing, its value to some consumers is a richer flavor than white sugar.|$|E
5|$|Caldas has a {{tradition}} of embroidery (bordado) possibly dating to the 15th century. Legend has it that Queen Leonor's handmaidens, seeing the monarch without her usual brilliance after selling off her jewellery, embroidered her cloak so that it appeared to have golden threads. Caldas embroidery is almost always made with three shades of <b>molasses</b> brown thread on white linen, and on rare occasion with white thread on brown linen. Known for its symmetry, the craft's common themes include arachnids, spirals, angles, birds, hearts, crowns, and shrimp nets.|$|E
5|$|Europeans would sail to the West African {{coast and}} trade African kings {{manufactured}} goods (rifles and ammunition) for slave. From there slaves {{would be sent}} to the West Indies or the east coast of North America to be used for labor. Goods such as cotton, <b>molasses,</b> sugar, tobacco would be sent from these places back to Europe. Europe would also use their goods and trade with Asian countries for tea, cloth and spices. The triangle trade in a sense was an agreement for established trade routes, that led to greater global integration, which ultimately contributed to globalization.|$|E
5|$|In 1517 {{the town}} was annexed to the Ottoman Empire {{along with the rest}} of the Levant. Both the names Kafr Burayk and Nabi Na'im were {{indicated}} for the village in the Ottoman tax registers of 1596, where it was listed in the Nahiya of Khalil in the Liwa of Quds. It had a population of 42 Muslim households and paid taxes on wheat, barley, vineyards or fruit trees, grape syrup or <b>molasses,</b> and goats or beehives.|$|E
5|$|Maple {{syrup and}} maple sugar were {{used during the}} American Civil War and by abolitionists {{in the years before}} the war because most cane sugar and <b>molasses</b> were {{produced}} by Southern slaves. Because of food rationing during the Second World War, people in the northeastern United States were encouraged to stretch their sugar rations by sweetening foods with maple syrup and maple sugar, and recipe books were printed to help housewives employ this alternative source.|$|E
5|$|Radau {{returns to}} food, {{describing}} sago and the breadfruit tree. The breadfruit tastes like Yorkshire pudding or mashed potato; with meat {{it is the}} best of vegetables; with sugar, milk, butter or <b>molasses,</b> it is a delicious pudding with a special flavour; Radau hopes that perhaps it will one day be found in European markets. As for the sago palm, one tree yields 1,800 cakes, enough to feed a man for a year.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{featured}} the penultimate {{appearance of the}} alien black oil; it would appear for a final time via flashback in the series' finale. Visual effects for the black oil were created with <b>molasses,</b> chocolate syrup, and computer-generated imagery (CGI). A scene showing black oil {{coming out of a}} worker's eyes, ears, and mouth was mostly filmed on a visual effects stage. Nine takes were needed to get the syrupy mixture to spill correctly.|$|E
5|$|To {{enter the}} whole wheat bread market, the bakery {{imported}} its own wheat-cleaning machine from Hungary; the machine {{actually had to}} be smuggled out since Hungary did not have diplomatic relations with Israel at the time. However, health-food consumers were wary of the first whole-wheat loaves because they were white, not brown. Working with the Health Food Association, Angel's {{came up with the}} solution of adding all-natural <b>molasses</b> to the bread to give it a brown color.|$|E
5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 {{hours or}} more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet fructose. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry until {{the time came to}} add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said to smell and taste like <b>molasses.</b>|$|E
5|$|L. ahuacaense {{is known}} only from Cerro El Ahuaca, a steep granite inselberg near Cariamanga in Loja Province, {{southern}} Ecuador, where it occurs {{at an altitude}} of , but only near rocky surfaces. The vegetation is dominated by the <b>molasses</b> grass (Melinis minutiflora). They eat plants, and traces of their feeding are visible on the mountain. Their habitat on Cerro El Ahuaca covers an area around , and the total population there may not contain more than a few dozen individuals. Except for some small outcrops close to the Cerro, no nearby habitat is suitable, but more populations may exist elsewhere in southern Ecuador or nearby northern Peru.|$|E
5|$|The final {{storm of}} the season was first {{observed}} on October28 over the Bahamas, {{and may have been}} a hybrid or subtropical cyclone. It moved north-northwestward through the island chain, followed by a turn to the north-northeast over the western Atlantic. Several ships encountered the tropical storm, and one lost their supply of <b>molasses.</b> On October30, the cyclone, at the time transitioning to extratropical, struck on the southern end of Long Beach Island with winds of 70mph (110km/h). As it moved through the northeastern United States, the storm dropped heavy rainfall, causing flooding near Jersey City and Hoboken, New Jersey. In Brooklyn, the storm moved the rail cars off their tracks, while in Providence, Rhode Island the winds destroyed three buildings and wrecked the roofs of two others. Further northeast, the storm disrupted shipping and cut telegraph lines, although no fatalities were reported. The post-tropical storm was last observed over Vermont late on October30.|$|E
5|$|The sugar may {{be transported}} in bulk {{to the country}} {{where it will be}} used and the {{refining}} process often takes place there. The first stage is known as affination and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular activated carbon or an ion-exchange resin. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners' <b>molasses.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Great <b>Molasses</b> Flood, {{also known}} as the Boston <b>Molasses</b> Disaster or the Great Boston <b>Molasses</b> Flood, {{occurred}} on January 15, 1919 in the North End neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. A large <b>molasses</b> storage tank burst and a wave of <b>molasses</b> rushed through the streets at an estimated , killing 21 and injuring 150. The event entered local folklore and for decades afterwards residents claimed that on hot summer days the area still smelled of <b>molasses.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Molasses</b> is {{produced}} in two forms: Blackstrap, which has a characteristic strong flavor, and a purer <b>molasses</b> syrup. Blackstrap <b>molasses</b> is sold as a food and dietary supplement. It is also a common ingredient in animal feed, is used to produce ethanol and rum, and in the manufacturing of citric acid. Purer <b>molasses</b> syrups are sold as <b>molasses,</b> and may also be blended with maple syrup, invert sugars, or corn syrup. Both forms of <b>molasses</b> are used in baking.|$|E
25|$|<b>Molasses</b> {{number or}} <b>molasses</b> {{efficiency}} {{is a measure}} of the mesopore content of the activated carbon (greater than 20 Å, or larger than 2 nm) by adsorption of <b>molasses</b> from solution.|$|E
25|$|The European <b>molasses</b> number (range 525–110) is {{inversely}} related to the North American <b>molasses</b> number.|$|E
25|$|Brown sugar comes {{either from}} the late stages of cane sugar refining, when sugar forms fine {{crystals}} with significant <b>molasses</b> content, or from coating white refined sugar with a cane <b>molasses</b> syrup (blackstrap <b>molasses).</b> Brown sugar's color and taste becomes stronger with increasing <b>molasses</b> content, as do its moisture-retaining properties. Brown sugars also tend to harden if exposed to the atmosphere, although proper handling can reverse this.|$|E
25|$|The Sugar Act of 1764 was {{the first}} tax in Grenville's program to raise a revenue in America, which was a {{modification}} of the <b>Molasses</b> Act of 1733. The <b>Molasses</b> Act had imposed a tax of 6 pence per gallon (equal to £ today) on foreign <b>molasses</b> imported into British colonies. The purpose of the <b>Molasses</b> Act was not actually to raise revenue, but instead to make foreign <b>molasses</b> so expensive that it effectively gave a monopoly to <b>molasses</b> imported from the British West Indies. It did not work; colonial merchants avoided the tax by smuggling or, more often, bribing customs officials. The Sugar Act reduced the tax to 3 pence per gallon (equal to £ today) {{in the hope that}} the lower rate would increase compliance and thus increase the amount of tax collected. The Act also taxed additional imports and included measures to make the customs service more effective.|$|E
25|$|On the 15 and 20 April Camilla {{took two}} more prizes, {{carrying}} rum, <b>molasses</b> and sugar, and <b>molasses,</b> respectively, {{but there are}} no details available. On 21 April, she captured Perfect, Etienne Codnet, Master, bound from Cape Nichola, Hispaniola, with a cargo of <b>molasses.</b> Then on the 25 and 26 April she took two more unknown vessels, both carrying rum and rice. She also captured Fonbonne, W. De Gallet, Master, and W. Galley, Owner, which was sailing from Cap-Français to Miquelon with a cargo of wine and <b>molasses.</b>|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 1919, the Great <b>Molasses</b> Flood {{occurred}} in the North End. Twenty-one {{people were killed and}} 150 injured as an immense wave of <b>molasses,</b> which rushed through the streets at an estimated , crushed and asphyxiated many of the victims to death. It took over six months to remove the <b>molasses</b> from the cobblestone streets, theaters, businesses, automobiles, and homes. Boston Harbor ran brown until summer.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of sugar leaves residues that differ substantially {{depending on the}} raw materials used and on the place of production. While cane <b>molasses</b> is often used in food preparation, humans find <b>molasses</b> from sugar beets unpalatable, and it consequently ends up mostly as industrial fermentation feedstock (for example in alcohol distilleries), or as animal feed. Once dried, either type of <b>molasses</b> can serve as fuel for burning.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 1919, the Purity Distilling Company's 2.3 million gallon <b>molasses</b> {{storage tank}} burst open, causing the Great <b>Molasses</b> Flood. A massive wave of <b>molasses</b> flowed down Commercial Street towards the waterfront, killing 21 people and {{injuring}} 150. Lawyers for the tank's owners tried {{to blame the}} explosion on Italian anarchists. The accident was later found {{to be due to}} the tank's poor construction and maintenance, but not before the initial reports had fueled anti-Italian sentiment.|$|E
