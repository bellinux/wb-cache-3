40|$|The contact {{network of}} a {{frictionless}} polydisperse granular packing is isostatic in {{the limit of}} low applied pressure. It is argued here that, on disordered isostatic networks, displacement–displacement and stress–stress static Green functions are described by random <b>multiplicative</b> <b>processes</b> and have a truncated power-law distribution, with a cut-off that grows exponentially with distance. If the external pressure is increased sufficiently, excess contacts are created, the packing becomes hyperstatic, and the abovementioned anomalous properties disappear because Green functions now have a bounded distribution. Thus, the low-pressure, isostatic, limit is a critical point. Granular matter, isostaticity, response functions, stress distributions, <b>multiplicative</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

30|$|We {{end this}} paper with the {{following}} comment: {{it has been found}} that the small deviation estimate has close connection with various approximation quantities of compact sets and operators and has a variety of applications in studies of Hausdorff dimensions, rate of convergence in Strassen’s law of the iterated logarithm, and empirical processes (see, e.g., [17, 18]). Intuitively, we expect the results which were obtained in this paper can enrich the above relative fields. Moreover, there are scant papers related to the admixture additive processes and the admixture <b>multiplicative</b> <b>processes.</b> The behaviors of the admixture additive processes and the admixture <b>multiplicative</b> <b>processes</b> deserve to be investigated extensively.|$|R

Despite this, many children experience difficulty in solving multiplicative problems. In recent times, teachers and teacher educators have tumed to ICT-based resources in order to provide a more effective learning environment in which to explore multiplication.

40|$|The Holo-Hilbert {{spectral}} analysis (HHSA) method is introduced {{to cure the}} deficiencies of traditional {{spectral analysis}} and to give a full informational representation of nonlinear and non-stationary data. It uses a nested empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) approach to identify intrinsic amplitude and frequency modulations often present in nonlinear systems. Comparisons are first made with traditional spectrum analysis, which usually achieved its results through convolutional integral transforms based on additive expansions of an a priori determined basis, mostly under linear and stationary assumptions. Thus, for non-stationary processes, the best one could do historically was to use the time- frequency representations, in which the amplitude (or energy density) variation is still represented in terms of time. For nonlinear processes, the data can have both amplitude and frequency modulations (intra-mode and inter-mode) generated by two different mechanisms: linear additive or nonlinear <b>multiplicative</b> <b>processes.</b> As all existing spectral analysis methods are based on additive expansions, either a priori or adaptive, {{none of them could}} possibly represent the <b>multiplicative</b> <b>processes.</b> While the earlier adaptive HHT spectral analysis approach could accommodate the intra-wave nonlinearity quite remarkably, it remained that any inter-wave nonlinear multiplicative mechanisms that include cross-scale coupling and phase-lock modulations were left untreated. To resolve the <b>multiplicative</b> <b>processes</b> issue, additional dimensions in the spectrum result are needed to account for the variations in both the amplitude and frequency modulations simultaneously. HHSA accommodates all the processes: additive and multiplicative, intra-mode and inter-mode, stationary and nonstationary, linear and nonlinear interactions. The Holo prefix in HHSA denotes a multiple dimensional representation with both additive and multiplicative capabilities...|$|R

We investigated the relation between shapes of distributions and model variables. By changing input variables, we explained the origin of the cumulative population distributions of municipalities and prefectures in Japan from 1980 to 2006.
