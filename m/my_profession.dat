[...] He can be funny, then turn right around and reach people and touch them with what life is like." [...] "I just want to be known as a clown", he said, [...] "because to me that's the height of <b>my</b> <b>profession.</b> It means you can do everything—sing, dance and above all, make people laugh." [...] His purpose in life, he believed, was to make people laugh.|$|E
500|$|While {{dividing}} his time, Blackstone {{became an}} administrator at All Souls, securing appointment as accountant, treasurer and bursar on 28 November 1746. Completion of the Codrington Library and Warton Building, first started in 1710 and 1720 respectively but not built until 1748, {{is attributed to}} his work. In 1749 he became Steward of the Manors, and in 1750 was made Senior Bursar. Records show a [...] "perfectionist zeal" [...] in organising the estates and finances of All Souls, and Blackstone was noted for massively simplifying the complex accounting system used by the college. In 1750 Blackstone completed his first legal tract, An Essay on Collateral Consanguinity, which dealt with those claiming a familial tie to the founder or All Souls {{in an attempt to}} gain preeminence in elections. Completion of his Doctor of Civil Law degree, which he was awarded in April 1750, admitted him to Convocation, the governing body of Oxford, which elected the two burgesses who represented it in the House of Commons, along with most of the university officers. With this and with his continuing work at the university, Blackstone announced on 3 July 1753 his intentions to [...] "no longer attend the Courts at Westminster, but to pursue <b>my</b> <b>Profession</b> in a Way more agreeable to me in all respects, by residing at Oxford [...] to engraft upon this Resolution a Scheme which I am told may be beneficial to the University as well as myself", which was to give a set of lectures on the common law – the first lectures of that sort in the world.|$|E

2500|$|Sim and {{his family}} guarded their privacy carefully. He seldom gave press {{interviews}} and always refused to sign autographs. In his view, the public's interest in him should be solely confined to his stage or screen performances.

2500|$|The {{promotion}} {{of research to}} make screening programs find ever more cancers is also criticized. One-third of diagnosed breast cancers might recede on their own. In addition to efficiently finding most deadly cancers, screening programs also find most non-life-threatening, asymptomatic breast cancers and pre-cancers, and miss some fast growing, aggressive, dangerous cancers. According to H. Gilbert Welch of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, [...] "I'm certainly not asking anyone to stop getting mammograms. I am asking <b>my</b> <b>profession</b> to tell women the truth about overdiagnosis." [...] Welch said that research on screening mammography has taken the [...] "brain-dead approach that says the best test {{is the one that}} finds the most cancers" [...] rather than the one that finds dangerous cancers.|$|E

[...] Deming has admitted that [...] "Western Civilization {{has a long history of}} misogyny," [...] but insisted that [...] "there is no institutional or private employer in the US today that openly discriminates against women." [...] He argued that equity does not require numerical equality, and claimed that women in the US enjoy some specific advantages over men: Women in US colleges receive better grades than men and are more likely to graduate. On average, US women live five years longer than men, and therefore receive five additional years of Social Security payments. Wouldn't it be fairer if the retirement age for men was five years earlier than for women? Ninety-three percent of all people incarcerated in US prisons are men. If equity is synonymous with numerical equality, then why don't we start paroling men earlier and begin prosecuting women more vigorously?" ...|$|E

[...] "Until you're known in <b>my</b> <b>profession</b> as a monster, you are not a star," [...] she said, [...] " [...] I've never fought for anything in a treacherous way.

(The end of this quotation has also appeared as [...] "some little woman, standing by my man and baking cookies, like Tammy Wynette."

The remark set off a firestorm of controversy. Wynette wrote to Clinton, saying, [...] "With all that is in me, I resent your caustic remark. I believe you have offended every true country-music fan and every person who has made it on their own with no one to take them to the White House."
