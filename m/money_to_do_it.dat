The true {{way to get out}} of debt is to 'arn money; I've found that much out since I found my mother; and, the cash in hand, all you have to do is to hand it over. Old Van Tassel was civil enough when he saw the bag of dollars, and was full of fine speeches. He didn't wish to {{distress}} the 'worthy Mrs. Wetmore, not he; and she was welcome to keep the money as long as she pleased, provided the interest was punctually paid;' but I'd have none of his soft words, and laid down the Spaniards, and told him to count them. I 'lifted his encumbrance,' as they call'd it, as easily as if it had been a pillow of fresh feathers, and walked off with that bit of paper in my hands, with the names tore off it, and satisfaction give me, as my lawyer said. This law is droll business, Miles; if money is paid, they give you satisfaction, just as gentlemen call on each other, you know, when a little cross. But, whatever you do, never put your hand and seal to a mortgage; for land under such a curse is as likely to slide one way as the other. Clawbonny is an older place than Willow Cove, even; and both are too venerable and venerated to be mortgaged." ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} impact of the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 (hereafter ‘CPA’) on contractual claims, and specifically whether the exceptio doli generalis is being reintroduced in the South African legal system. This dissertation illustrates that although the CPA improves the position of the consumer in many ways, the legislature should have drafted some provisions more carefully which could have resulted in clarifying some vital issues. Many terms and principles introduced by the CPA are foreign to the South African legal system. Although practice and precedent will eventually provide solutions to many of the practical difficulties currently experienced, it will take time and <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. <b>It</b> is therefore submitted that some areas should be reconsidered for amendment by the legislature in order to allow this significant piece of legislation to operate optimally Ultimately, two sets of conclusions can be drawn in this dissertation. Firstly, the general conclusions relating to whether the defence of the exceptio doli generalis has been reintroduced in the South African legal system by the CPA and, secondly, whether the exceptio doli generalis is in line with our constitutional values and in line with the current rules for the interpretation of contracts. Although the Courts have abolished the defence ofexceptio doli generalis, {{it seems as if the}} CPA has reintroduced this defence. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.

50|$|Part 1D.S. Mackenzie Stone (John Hannah) is distraught {{after his}} wife's sudden {{disappearance}} on their fifth wedding anniversary, and strives tirelessly {{to discover what}} has happened to her. He has very little memory of what happened on the night she disappeared, and struggles to comprehend any reason as to why she took off, except for brief flashbacks and terrible nightmares. Three months on, whilst constantly searching through missing persons reports, Stone comes across two cases: one involving a man named Paul West, who was reported missing after his wife and son were killed in a house fire, and the other the mysterious John Dean (Anthony Calf), an IT consultant who has lost his memory for unknown reasons and that he moved into the town only days after the fire. Stone is convinced that Dean is actually West, and that he murdered his wife and stepson. Meanwhile, Dean is looking for information to help him find out exactly who he was before he lost his memory. He is asked to take part in an experiment for a memory treatment that shows great promise. At first he refuses, unsure that he wants to rediscover his past as he is happily married to Jenna (Jemma Redgrave), and has a good life - but deciding they need the <b>money,</b> agrees <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
