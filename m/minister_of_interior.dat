5|$|On 11 October 1943, Lorković {{was named}} <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Interior,</b> where he {{advocated}} stricter policing, {{and a second}} term as Foreign Minister from 29 April until 5 May 1944, after his friend Perić was removed from office. It was agreed that Lorković would remain Foreign Minister and <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Interior</b> simultaneously, but was soon replaced by Mehmed Alajbegović as Foreign Minister. After realising that Germany would lose {{the war and the}} NDH would cease to exist, he advocated radical changes in state policy. In February 1944, he wrote a detailed memorandum in German which summarized the history, current situation and the fundamental problems of the NDH and its Armed Forces, as well as problems with the German Army.|$|E
5|$|After {{joining the}} National Liberal Party (PNL), {{he was elected}} to the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in November 1919, {{representing}} Gorj County. Among his first notable actions as a politician was an initiative to interpellate Nicolae L. Lupu, the <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Interior</b> Affairs Ministry in the Romanian National Party-Peasants' Party cabinet, in answer to concerns that the executive was tolerating socialist agitation in the countryside.|$|E
5|$|As a student, {{he joined}} the Croatian Party of Rights but, viewed as a {{dissident}} in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, he fled the country to avoid arrest and eventually settled in Germany where he obtained a doctorate in law at the University of Berlin. In 1934, {{he joined the}} Ustaše and became a close associate of Ante Pavelić. Although he was initially commander of all Ustaše in Germany, where he sought support in creating and protecting a Croatian state, he later became leader of all Ustaše outside Italy. Soon after {{the establishment of the}} NDH, he was appointed as Foreign Minister and strongly opposed Italian influence on the state. After his cabinet chief, Ivo Kolak, was executed in 1943 for smuggling gold, Lorković was removed from office but later named <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Interior.</b> As <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Interior,</b> he negotiated with the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) in the hopes of establishing a coalition government. He also held secret negotiations with HSS representatives to propose having the NDH join the Allies against Germany. Although he apparently had the support of Pavelić, he and his cohorts were soon arrested as conspirators against the state and after a period in detention was executed at the end of April 1945 alongside Ante Vokić.|$|E

5|$|In June 2015, {{two members}} of the Security Committee of the Czech Parliament visited Uherský Brod and talked to {{multiple}} witnesses. The MPs issued a report condemning handling of the situation by the police. Among other issues, the MPs criticized that policemen parked their cars and put bullet proof vests on within the shooting range of the attacker, initially failed to get information from the witnesses and only later during the intervention attempted to contact them, didn't cover the back exit and thus potentially allowed the perpetrator {{to get out of the}} object and jeopardize other people. The police even let a helicopter land within the shooting range of the attacker. According to MPs, the police left much to be desired in regards of communication and most importantly, they wrongly decided to believe the perpetrator's claim of having hostage even though the witnesses could have readily confirmed that everyone inside was most likely dead. The policemen didn't seal the vicinity of the attack until 1pm and used civilian phones in communication with superior officers instead of using either their own phones or radio transmitters. <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Interior</b> Chovanec commented that the MPs failed to interview the policemen and thus didn't get all the relevant information.|$|E
