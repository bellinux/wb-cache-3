5|$|Charlton {{lost the}} 1925 election, {{largely due to}} his stance on {{industrial}} relations and continual militant union action which plagued his campaign. Charlton always aided in maintaining amicable relations in the party and many times lent his expertise to conflicts within the NSW branch of the Labor Party. He resigned from his positions on 29 March 1928. His successor James Scullin {{went on to become}} the Prime Minister of Australia, something Charlton never <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mike Smith was {{the latest}} goaltender to score a goal in the NHL, which he <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in a 5–2 victory of the Phoenix Coyotes over the Detroit Red Wings on October 19, 2013. He scored the goal with only 1/10 of a second {{left in the third}} period. He is also the only goaltender to be {{credited}} with a goal in both the NHL and the ECHL, having scored a goal {{as a member of the}} Lexington Men O' War on October 26, 2002, against the Dayton Bombers.|$|E
5|$|By 24 November, Potiorek was {{predicting}} that Serbia would be defeated {{within a matter}} of days and appointed Stjepan Sarkotić to be the country's governor once it was occupied. The Austro-Hungarians made further gains on 25 November, forcing the Serbian Army from Čovka and Vrače Brdo with an intense artillery bombardment. On 26 November, they attempted to cross the Kolubara at its junction with the Sava River and <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in their initial attack. The Serbs soon counterattacked and forced the invaders back, inflicting 50 percent casualties on the Austro-Hungarians and causing their offensive to grind to a halt. On 27 November, the Serbian Army attacked Čovka and Vrače Brdo and succeeded in forcing the Austro-Hungarians out.|$|E

5|$|Throughout Nowitzki's career, he {{has responded}} to the {{increased}} pressure of the playoffs by increasing his productivity. As {{of the end of}} the 2013–14 season, he had averaged 22.5 points and 8.1 rebounds in the regular season. In the playoffs, he has averaged 25.6 points and 10.1 rebounds, which only Hakeem Olajuwon, Bob Pettit, and Elgin Baylor have <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> In the most pressure packed games, such as playoff elimination games he averages 28.8 points, 11.8 rebounds. He has had 14 elimination games where he scored 30 or more points, which ties him with Jerry West for most all time. Of the top 100 elimination game performances in the last 20 years, Nowitzki has had the best performances in 8 of them, more than any other player in the NBA in that same time frame.|$|E
5|$|Youzhny {{has reached}} the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slams, as of 2013 only 11 other active players have <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same. He has reached a Grand Slam {{semifinal}} twice, both at the US Open, in 2006 and 2010. While chiefly a singles player, Youzhny {{has reached the}} quarterfinals of a grand slam in doubles twice, at the 2006 US Open and the 2014 Australian Open. He debuted within the top 10 in January 2008, but ended the year as a top 10 player for {{the only time in}} his career in 2010. As of 2013, Youzhny is third most successful Russian tennis player in history if considering match wins only, trailing behind Nikolay Davydenko and Yevgeny Kafelnikov.|$|E
5|$|Merckx {{looked to}} be heading for a record sixth Tour victory in 1975, but Bernard Thévenet beat him, {{becoming}} the first French winner in seven years. Thévenet won again in 1977; however, he was eclipsed in following years by fellow Frenchman Bernard Hinault, who won consecutive Tours in 1978 and 1979. Hinault won the Tour at his first attempt in 1978; becoming one of 11 cyclists (including Anquetil, Merckx, Hugo Koblet and Fausto Coppi) <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. In 1980, Hinault was going for a third consecutive win, but had to pull out because of tendinitis, and the Tour was won by Joop Zoetemelk. Hinault returned in 1981 and won that race {{as well as the}} one after that. Hinault sat out the Tour in 1983, and another Frenchman—Laurent Fignon—achieved victory. Fignon won again the following year, beating Hinault; Hinault recovered in 1985 to win his fifth Tour.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} seven, Bede was sent, as a puer oblatus, to {{the monastery}} of Monkwearmouth by his family to be educated by Benedict Biscop and later by Ceolfrith. Bede does not say whether it was already {{intended}} {{at that point that}} he would be a monk. It was fairly common in Ireland at this time for young boys, particularly those of noble birth, to be fostered out as an oblate; the practice was also likely to have been common among the Germanic peoples in England. Monkwearmouth's sister monastery at Jarrow was founded by Ceolfrith in 682, and Bede probably transferred to Jarrow with Ceolfrith that year. The dedication stone for the church has survived to the present day; it is dated 23 April 685, and as Bede would have been required to assist with menial tasks in his day-to-day life it is possible that he helped in building the original church. In 686, plague broke out at Jarrow. The Life of Ceolfrith, written in about 710, records that only two surviving monks were capable of singing the full offices; one was Ceolfrith and the other a young boy, who according to the anonymous writer had been taught by Ceolfrith. The two <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the entire service of the liturgy until others could be trained. The young boy was almost certainly Bede, who would have been about 14.|$|E

25|$|Tensions {{were further}} raised when in May 1572 the news reached Paris that a French Huguenot army under Louis of Nassau had crossed from France to the Netherlandish {{province}} of Hainaut and captured the Catholic strongholds of Mons and Valenciennes (now in Belgium and France, respectively). Louis governed the Principality of Orange around Avignon in southern France {{for his brother}} William the Silent, who was leading the Dutch Revolt against the Spanish.
