5|$|Some animals {{including}} cephalopods like squid {{are able}} to vary their colours rapidly for both camouflage and signalling. The mechanisms include reversible proteins which can be switched between two configurations. The configuration of reflectin proteins in chromatophore cells in {{the skin of the}} Doryteuthis pealeii squid is controlled by electric charge. When charge is absent, the proteins stack together tightly, forming a thin, <b>more</b> <b>reflective</b> layer; when charge is present, the molecules stack more loosely, forming a thicker layer. Since chromatophores contain multiple reflectin layers, the switch changes the layer spacing and hence the colour of light that is reflected.|$|E
5|$|The series {{used the}} first {{incarnation}} of the Blackadder theme by Howard Goodall (with {{the exception of the}} unaired pilot, which featured a different arrangement). For the opening theme, a trumpet solo accompanied by an orchestra was used. For the end titles, the theme gained mock-heroic lyrics sung by a baritone (Simon Carrington, a member of the King's Singers). In the final episode, the theme was sung with altered lyrics by a treble, in a <b>more</b> <b>reflective</b> style. The series' incidental music was unusually performed by pipe organ and percussion.|$|E
5|$|Among revivals in the 1950s and later, Hepokoski singles out as {{particularly}} notable the Glyndebourne productions with Fernando Corena and later Geraint Evans {{in the title}} role; three different stagings by Franco Zeffirelli, for the Holland Festival (1956), Covent Garden (1961) and the Metropolitan Opera (1964); and Luchino Visconti's 1966 version in Vienna. A 1982 production by Ronald Eyre, <b>more</b> <b>reflective</b> and melancholy than usual, was staged in Los Angeles, London and Florence; Renato Bruson was Falstaff and Giulini conducted. Among more recent players of the title role Bryn Terfel has taken the part at Covent Garden in 1999, in a production by Graham Vick, conducted by Bernard Haitink. and at the Metropolitan Opera in {{a revival of the}} Zeffirelli production, conducted by James Levine in 2006.|$|E

50|$|This {{substitution}} {{is thought}} of as {{taking place in the}} automatic intuitive judgment system, rather than the <b>more</b> self-aware <b>reflective</b> system. Hence, when someone tries to answer a difficult question, they may actually answer a related but different question, without realizing that a substitution has taken place.|$|R
5000|$|Giddens, for example, {{noted that}} {{constitutive}} reflexivity {{is possible in}} any social system, and that this presents a distinct methodological problem for the social sciences. Giddens accentuated this theme with his notion of [...] "reflexive modernity" [...] - the argument that, over time, society is becoming increasingly <b>more</b> self-aware, <b>reflective,</b> and hence reflexive.|$|R
5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} known to exhibit high radar reflectivity, in a {{frequency}} range of 50MHz to 1.3GHz. This behaviour is not well understood but a {{possible explanation is that}} the ice grains become coated with a thin metal film composed of sodium and iron, which makes the cloud far <b>more</b> <b>reflective</b> to radar, although this explanation remains controversial. Sodium and iron atoms are stripped from incoming micrometeors and settle into a layer just above the altitude of noctilucent clouds, and measurements have shown that these elements are severely depleted when the clouds are present. Other experiments have demonstrated that, at the extremely cold temperatures of a noctilucent cloud, sodium vapour can rapidly be deposited onto an ice surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} to the riots on the Chinese blogosphere was markedly more varied than the official response. Despite blocks and censorship, Internet watchers monitored continued attempts by netizens to publish their own thoughts on {{the causes of the}} incident or vent their anger about the violence. While some bloggers were supportive of the government, others were <b>more</b> <b>reflective</b> of the event's cause. On numerous forums and news sites, government workers quickly removed comments about the riots. Common themes were calls for punishment for those responsible; some posts evoked the name of Wang Zhen, the general who is respected by Hans and other minorities, and feared by many Uyghurs for repression after the communist takeover of Xinjiang in 1949.|$|E
5|$|The Dream Within a Dream Tour was {{the fourth}} concert tour by American {{recording}} artist Britney Spears. It was launched in support of her third studio album, Britney (2001). The tour was promoted by Concerts West, marking the first time Spears did not tour with Clear Channel Entertainment. On September 21, 2001, a North American tour was announced that kicked off exactly two months later after various dates were postponed. In February 2002, Spears announced a second leg of the tour. It was directed and choreographed by Wade Robson, who explained the main theme of the show was Spears's coming of age and newfound independence. The stage was designed by Steve Cohen and Rob Brenner and was composed of a main stage and a B-stage, united by a runway. Inspired by Cleopatra's barge, a flying device was developed so Spears could travel over the audience to the B-stage. The setlist was mostly composed by songs from the supporting album, as Spears felt they were <b>more</b> <b>reflective</b> of her personality. Songs from her previous two studio albums were also included in remixed form by Robson.|$|E

At that time, the depot had a wheel lathe and two snowploughs.

25|$|In March 2008, {{newly built}} VLocity set VL41 was outshopped with an altered cab livery {{following}} recommendations in recent level crossing accident reports to make trains more visible to motorists.

25|$|Telescopes {{and other}} {{precision}} instruments use front silvered or first surface mirrors, where the reflecting surface {{is placed on}} the front (or first) surface of the glass (this eliminates reflection from glass surface ordinary back mirrors have).

5000|$|Dichroic {{filters are}} made by {{depositing}} a series of etalonic layers on an optical surface by vapor deposition. These optical filters usually have <b>more</b> exact <b>reflective</b> and pass bands than absorptive filters. When properly designed, they run cooler than absorptive filters because they can reflect unwanted wavelengths. Dichroic filters are widely used in optical equipment such as light sources, cameras, astronomical equipment, and laser systems.|$|R
50|$|The Deliberative Opinion Poll, {{sometimes}} called a Deliberative Poll, {{is a form}} of opinion poll that incorporates the principles of deliberative democracy. Professor James S. Fishkin of Stanford University first described the concept in 1988.The typical deliberative opinion poll takes a random, representative sample of citizens and engages them in deliberation on current issues or proposed policy changes through small-group discussions and conversations with competing experts to create <b>more</b> informed and <b>reflective</b> public opinion.

25|$|The {{reflectivity}} of {{the mirror}} coating can be measured using a reflectometer and for a particular metal it will be different for different wavelengths of light. This is exploited in some optical work to make cold mirrors and hot mirrors. A cold mirror is made by using a transparent substrate and choosing a coating material that is <b>more</b> <b>reflective</b> to visible light and more transmissive to infrared light.|$|E
25|$|Gautier's {{literary}} criticism was <b>more</b> <b>reflective</b> in nature; his literary analysis was {{free from the}} pressure of his art and theatre columns and therefore, {{he was able to}} express his ideas without restriction. He made a clear distinction between prose and poetry, stating that prose should never be considered the equal of poetry. The bulk of Gautier's criticism, however, was journalistic. He raised the level of journalistic criticism of his day.|$|E

50|$|The work {{is based}} around a motto theme built from {{ascending}} and descending fourths.
