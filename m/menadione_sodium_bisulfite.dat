40|$|ABSTRACT A {{study with}} chicks was {{conducted}} to compare the relative vitamin K 3 stability of various menadione preparations in mash and pellets. The preparations assayed were <b>menadione</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulfite,</b> <b>menadione</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulfite</b> complex, menadione dimethylpyrimidinol bisulfite and Kastab (a physically stabilized preparation of <b>menadione</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulfite).</b> Pelleting increased the stability of all preparations when measured by the partial thromboplastin assay. The general trend in stability obtained by both procedures was in decreasing order: Kastab, menadione dimethylpyrimidinol bisulfite, menadione bisulfite complex and menadione bisulfite.

40|$|Vitamin K {{comprises}} a {{group of}} substances, which are widespread in nature and are an essential co-factor in humans in the synthesis of several proteins that {{play a role in}} haemostasis and others that may be important in calcium homeostasis.

MSB kept the stable increase in the electron transfer from intact yeast cells to anode compared to menadione, but the electron transfer promoted by MSB was inhibited in permeabilized yeast cell suspension. Menadione promoted oxidation of NAD(P) H much faster than MSB in permeabilized yeast cell suspension, suggesting the oxidative stress due to consumption of NAD(P) H. The proliferation of yeast cells was inhibited by menadione under aerobic conditions rather than anaerobic conditions, and the inhibitory effect was reduced by superoxide dismutase and catalase. The effect of MSB on the proliferation was much smaller than that of menadione. The above facts suggest that harmless MSB promotes the electron transfer from plasma membrane of yeast cells to anode. On the other hand, harmful menadione might promote the electron transfer from cytosol and plasma membrane to anode and dissolved oxygen...|$|E

40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) {{are a common}} {{byproduct}} of mitochondrial energy metabolism, and can also be induced by exogenous sources, including UV light, radiation, and environmental toxins. ROS generation is essential for maintaining homeostasis by triggering cellular signaling pathways and host defense mechanisms. However, an imbalance of ROS induces oxidative stress and cellular death and is associated with human disease, including age-related locomotor impairment.

We have investigated the oxygen consumption rates and oxygen concentration in wild-type (WT) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depleted (ρ 0) Molt- 4 cells. Wild-type Molt- 4 cells have moderate oxygen consumption rates, which were significantly reduced in the ρ 0 cells. PCMB (p-chloromercurobenzoate) inhibited the oxygen consumption rates in both WT and ρ 0 cells, whereas potassium cyanide decreased the oxygen consumption rates only in WT Molt- 4 cells. <b>Menadione</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulfite</b> (MSB) increased the oxygen consumption rates in both cell lines, whereas CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone) stimulated the oxygen consumption rates only in WT Molt- 4 cells.

An oxygen gradient between the extra- and intracellular compartments was observed in WT Molt- 4 cells, which further increased when cells were stimulated by CCCP and MSB.

This was achieved by using the well-established brine shrimp bioassay. The experiment was conducted in 2 stages, with (1) 12 -h mortality time course and (2) LC 50 determination for 12 - and 24 -h exposures. Treatments consisted of MC-LR, CE, and MSB alone and with 4 -h pretreatments of either vitamin E or Trolox. Sensitivity of A. franciscana nauplii with 24 -h LC 50 values of 11 (10. 1 - 12. 1) mg/ml for MSB and 9. 5 (8. 8 - 10. 4) mg/ml for MC-LR were in general agreement with values reported for Artemia sp. Both antioxidant pretreatments resulted in significant reductions in mortality of approximately 50 % at 9 h postexposure when challenged by either 40 mg/ml MC-LR or 20 mg/ml MSB. In contrast, the antioxidant pretreatments offered little to no protection from CE, suggesting that other uncharacterized bioactive compounds contributed to overall toxicity. The described bioassay is easily accessible, inexpensive, rapid, and complies with animal ethics guidelines of many countries, and thus provides a potential alternative to the mouse bioassay for the initial screening for chemoprotectants against MC-LR toxicity.

The reaction rate increased as {{the concentration of}} acetone increased, the maxima of the fluorescence spectra, however, remained unchanged. The sensitized photochemical reaction was assumed {{to begin with the}} absorption of photons by acetone and a triplet-triplet energy transfer process was proposed for the sensitizing mechanism, in which acetone acted as an energy donor, and MSB as an energy acceptor. A new in situ photochemical fluorimetric method was consequently proposed for the determination of MSB. The solutions were pumped through a PTFE mixing-tube and then stopped and kept in an 18 mu l flow cell where the photochemical reaction took place in situ on irradiation for 120 s (with an excitation wavelength, lambda(ex), 280 nm, excitation slit, EX, 7 nm), and then lambda(ex) was changed from 280 to 340 nm promptly to measure the fluorescence intensity of the photochemical product at 465 nm. Na 2 SO 3 was used as the deoxygenation reagent. The calibration graph was linear up to 1. 1 mu g ml(- 1) MSB (r= 0. 999), and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0. 76 ng ml(- 1).

When sGC is activated, it converts GTP to the second messenger cGMP contributing to vasorelaxation, platelet aggregation, angiogenesis, vascular remodeling and synaptic transmission. In the present study, we investigated two aspects of the molecular regulation {{of the most common}} heterodimeric form of sGC (α 1 β 1) : 1) sGC regulation by Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp 90) and 2) regulation by Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). With respect to the first part of our study, after verifying the interaction of the two proteins, we demonstrated that both the α 1 and β 1 sGC subunits are able to bind Hsp 90. Characterization of the region of Hsp 90 required to bind the β 1 subunit in in vitro binding assays revealed that residues 237 to 628 were involved in the interaction. The region of β 1 responsible for binding Hsp 90 was demonstrated to not include the first 100 amino acids of the subunit. The physiological importance of the sGC/Hsp 90 interaction was investigated by treating rat aortic smooth muscle cells with the Hsp 90 inhibitors geldanamycin (GA) and radicicol (RAD) and determining both sGC activity and protein levels. Long-term (24 or 48 hrs) inhibition of Hsp 90 resulted in a strong decrease of both α 1 and β 1 protein levels and sGC activity. In addition, incubation of the same type of cells with the proteasome inhibitor N-benzoyloxycarbonyl (Z) -Leu-Leu-leucinal (MG- 132) blocked the GA-induced down-regulation of sGC, suggesting that the disruption of the sGC/Hsp 90 complex renders the sGC subunits prompt to proteasomal degradation. With respect to the second part of this study, we demonstrated that long-term (12 and 24 hrs) exposure of rat aortic smooth muscle cells to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and the ROS-releasing agents xanthine/xanthine oxidase (X/XO) and <b>menadione</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulfite</b> (MSB), resulted in a strong decrease of both the α 1 and β 1 protein levels and the SNP-stimulated cGMP accumulation. Furthermore, we showed that platelet-derived Growth Factor (PDGF) had similar down-regulatory effects on the protein levels of the sGC subunits, that could be prevented by pretreatment with the anti-oxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), suggesting that endogenously produced ROS are capable of inhibiting sGC expression. Exposure of rat aortic smooth muscle cells to the proteasomal inhibitor MG- 132 had no effect on the ROS-induced down-regulation of sGC, suggesting that ROS decrease sGC protein levels and activity in a manner independent of the proteasomal degradation pathway. In an effort to identify a mechanism responsible for the actions of ROS on sGC, we also examined the involvement of the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and the protein tyrosine kinases in the phenomenon observed. Using inhibitors of the above kinases, we demonstrated that ROS’ effects on sGC are not facilitated through any of the two types of kinases. Finally, we demonstrated that long-term exposure of rat aortic smooth muscle cells to H 2 O 2 also caused a decrease in the mRNA levels of α 1 (by 68 %), which was accompanied by a reduction in the α 1 promoter-driven luciferase activity. This observation along with the fact that rat aortic smooth muscle cells exposed to H 2 O 2 also exhibited reduced levels of the mRNA-stabilizing protein Human Antigen R (HuR), suggested that ROS down-regulate sGC through inhibition of transcription and the destabilization of sGC subunits’ mRNA. We conclude, that both the exogenously added, as well as the endogenously produced ROS trigger the down-regulation of sGC protein and activity and that that is due to a reduction in steady state sGC mRNA. To sum up, in the present thesis we showed the regulation of sGC at the post-translational level by Hsp 90 and at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level by ROS. In both cases, regardless the underlying molecular mechanism, the final outcome was the alteration of the cells’ physiological ability to respond to NO. This is indicative {{of the fact that the}} cell possesses and utilizes many different and often opposing mechanisms to regulate one single molecule, in order to promptly and effectively respond to any given stimulus at any given time. ...|$|E
