60|$|To {{his right}} {{a line of}} hills rose up, a distant green mass. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> reach them. He began to walk slowly. He {{had to be very}} careful. They were looking for him--and they had weapons. Incredible weapons.|$|E
5000|$|... 1990 {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the Rainey era with the Marlboro-Yamaha rider taking 7 wins and scoring points in every race but Hungary after he had already clinched the championship. Rainey's teammate was 1989 champion Eddie Lawson, but he was unable to defend his championship after breaking his left ankle in the first round and then severely shattering his right ankle the following round at Laguna Seca. Rainey on having Lawson as a teammate: “I just wanted to devastate Eddie. I don’t think he was ready for a team-mate like me. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> control me, but at that stage I was past being controlled.” Rainey switched from Dunlop to Michelin tires this year.|$|R
50|$|The {{confusion}} {{surrounding the}} claim to {{invention of the}} telescope and the microscope arises {{in part from the}} (sometimes conflicting) testimony of Zacharias Janssen's son, Johannes Zachariassen. Johannes claims include that his father invented the telescope in 1590, that his father invented the telescope in 1604, that he and his father invented the telescope in 1618, and that Jacob Metius and Cornelis Drebbel bought a telescope from him and his father in 1620 and copied it. Johannes also seems to have lied about his own date of birth, <b>maybe</b> so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> stake his own claim as inventor of the telescope along with his father.|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, Barnet goalkeeper, {{coach and}} manager Gary Phillips said of Flashman, [...] "A {{lot of people}} knock Stan and I had my runs ins with {{him as much as}} anyone {{but at the end of}} the day he did save the place once. When he was good he was very, very, generous, and most of the time he looked after the lads well. Unfortunately when it went sour <b>he,</b> <b>maybe,</b> <b>could</b> have handled things a lot better".|$|R

If {{he owned}} {{one half of}} the general dog, it would be so; if he owned one end of the dog and another person owned the other end, it would be so, just the same; {{particularly}} in the first case, because if you kill one half of a general dog, there ain't any man that can tell whose half it was; but if he owned one end of the dog, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> kill his end of it and--" ...|$|E
60|$|On {{through the}} jungle he forced his way in the {{direction}} of the stamping ground of his tribe. He hoped that his king would have forgotten his treason; but if not he was still resigned to his fate--any fate would be better than suffering longer the sole companionship of this frightful she, and then, too, he wished to exhibit his captive to his fellows. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> wish her on the king--it is possible that such a thought urged him on.|$|E
60|$|He {{was a good}} looker all right. When he was in {{condition}} {{his muscles}} stood out in bunches all over him. And he was the strongest looking brute I ever saw in Alaska, also the most intelligent looking. To run your eyes over him, you'd think he could outpull three dogs of his own weight. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> but I never saw it. His intelligence didn't run that way. He could steal and forage to perfection; he had an instinct that was positively grewsome for divining when work was {{to be done and}} for making a sneak accordingly; and for getting lost and not staying lost he was nothing short of inspired. But when it came to work, the way that intelligence dribbled out of him and left him a mere clot of wobbling, stupid jelly would make your heart bleed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we emptied {{a bucket}} of water over his linstock and priming, d'ye see, so <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> did all <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> But there's France, where that {{thickening}} is over yonder." ...|$|R

50|$|He {{considered}} where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{get such}} experience. There was the Musashi Flex, a loosely-organized band of modern ronins who travelled around challenging each other; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> try that. Or, there was The Maze. Such a thing was risky, but it offered a real test. Injury was likely, death a possibility {{in the game}} known as The Maze; if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> survive that, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> would be ready....|$|R
6000|$|Jim {{did these}} {{up in the}} square of gingham, and he tied it across cater-cornered twice, in double knots, and showed Pony how he could put his hand through and carry it just as easy. He hid it under the bed for him, and he told Pony {{that if he was}} in Pony's place he should go to bed right away or pretty soon, so that nobody would think {{anything}}, and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get some sleep before he got up and went down to wait on the front steps for the circus to come along. He promised to be there with the other boys and keep them from fooling or making a noise, or doing anything to wake his father up, or make the constable come. [...] "You see, Pony," [...] he said, [...] "if you can run off this year, and come back with the circus next year, then a whole lot of fellows can run off. Don't you see that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Why, {{that simple}} old Laxart sat {{up there and}} droned out the most tedious and empty tale one ever heard, and neither he nor Papa D'Arc ever gave a thought to the badness of the {{etiquette}} of it, or ever suspected that that foolish tale was anything but dignified and valuable history. There was not an atom of value in it; and whilst they thought it distressing and pathetic, {{it was in fact}} not pathetic at all, but actually ridiculous. At least it seemed so to me, and it seems so yet. Indeed, I know it was, because it made Joan laugh; and the more sorrowful it got the more it made her laugh; and the Paladin said that he could have laughed himself if she had not been there, and Noel Rainguesson said the same. It was about old Laxart going to a funeral there at Domremy two or three weeks back. He had spots all over his face and hands, and he got Joan to rub some healing ointment on them, and while she was doing it, and comforting him, and trying to say pitying things to him, he told her how it happened. And first he asked her if she remembered that black bull calf that she left behind when she came away, and she said indeed she did, and he was a dear, and she loved him so, and was he well?--and just drowned him in questions about that creature. And {{he said it was a}} young bull now, and very frisky; and he was to bear a principal hand at a funeral; and she said, [...] "The bull?" [...] and he said, [...] "No, myself"; but said the bull did take a hand, but not because of his being invited, for he wasn't; but anyway he was away over beyond the Fairy Tree, and fell asleep on the grass with his Sunday funeral clothes on, and a long black rag on his hat and hanging down his back; and when he woke he saw by the sun how late it was, and not a moment to lose; and jumped up terribly worried, and saw the young bull grazing there, and thought <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> ride part way on him and gain time; so he tied a rope around the bull's body to hold on by, and put a halter on him to steer with, and jumped on and started; but it was all new to the bull, and he was discontented with it, and scurried around and bellowed and reared and pranced, and Uncle Laxart was satisfied, and wanted to get off and go by the next bull or some other way that was quieter, but he didn't dare try; and it was getting very warm for him, too, and disturbing and wearisome, and not proper for Sunday; but by and by the bull lost all his temper, and went tearing down the slope with his tail in the air and blowing in the most awful way; and just in the edge of the village he knocked down some beehives, and the bees turned out and joined the excursion, and soared along in a black cloud that nearly hid those other two from sight, and prodded them both, and jabbed them and speared them and spiked them, and made them bellow and shriek, and shriek and bellow; and here they came roaring through the village like a hurricane, and took the funeral procession right in the center, and sent that section of it sprawling, and galloped over it, and the rest scattered apart and fled screeching in every direction, every person with a layer of bees on him, and not a rag of that funeral left but the corpse; and finally the bull broke for the river and jumped in, and when they fished Uncle Laxart out he was nearly drowned, and his face looked like a pudding with raisins in it. And then he turned around, this old simpleton, and looked a long time in a dazed way at Joan where she had her face in a cushion, dying, apparently, and says: ...|$|E
50|$|Tommy {{has a real}} {{campaign}} {{going to}} elect Mike the Man of the Century. If Mike were elected, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> even {{get rid of that}} smell from the canning factory. Tommy's father reacts by nudging Tommy toward enlistment in the Army. He wants his boy to be an athlete, a hero or, at the very least, a star on the memorial monument.|$|E
5000|$|Several years later, after Beethoven's death, Christoph {{reflects}} on his experiences with Beethoven, saying that while Beethoven is gone, [...] "his music will never die." [...] Beethoven [...] "thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{change the world}} with his music -- <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> will... bit by bit." ...|$|R
60|$|She kept on sobbing then {{without any}} noise, and Almayer {{stared at her}} in {{boundless}} astonishment. The idea that, <b>maybe,</b> <b>he</b> had done wrong by confiding in her, upset him so much {{that for a moment}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not find a connected thought in his head.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> {{have been}} son of Luther Redfield {{and might have}} been born in Clyde, New York, March 27, 1824. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> have {{graduated}} from Yale College in 1845.

Christopher Morgan, Secretary of State of New York.|$|R
5000|$|Foschini {{trained with}} Ottawa Fury FC from early {{pre-season}} through to mid May 2015. He trained {{with the team}} full-time and played several pre-season matches. Marc Dos Santos said Foschini would have been signed already if Fury wasn't carrying {{the maximum number of}} international players."I loved him ... he's definitely an NASL-level player," [...] said Dos Santos. [...] "We're going to keep a door open, a good contact and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be an option in 2016." ...|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "The Sting", {{he joins}} Andy's band with Darryl, {{and is the}} drummer. He {{suggests}} that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> sing Andy's song, but Andy believes Kevin's voice would be better suited for a novelty song about frogs. Kevin still tries to persuade Andy to let him sing his song, since he believes he has a unique voice, [...] "like Bob Dylan". Later, the band performs a song titled [...] "Bullfrog in Love", with Kevin doing the vocals.|$|E
50|$|Necromentia is a 2009 horror film {{directed}} by Pearry Reginald Teo. The screenplay concerns {{three men who}} have their lives turned over by {{the existence of a}} tattooed Ouija Board, which opens the gateways to other dimensions. Hagen keeps the corpse of his lover in his house, hoping that one day she will come back from the dead as promised. When he meets a man named Travis, he learns that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> venture into hell and bring her back from the dead himself.|$|E
50|$|It was a {{peculiar}} {{stroke of luck}} that he found a human duplication machine. It was an old machine, and it didn't work reliably after the first five copies were made. But if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> just duplicate the right world leaders, essentially make extra copies of them, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> {{would have a chance}} bringing peace to Earth and Venus.|$|R
50|$|In 1855, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{have been}} removed to Iowa, and might have {{established}} himself near the geographical center of the State. The town of Redfield, Iowa might have received its name from him, but it is unclear. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> held several offices of trust in Dallas County, Iowa, and in 1860 might have been elected to the Iowa State Senate.|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>could</b> <b>he</b> {{if he was}} at the ranch? But wait a minute! He said {{something}} about going fishing in that brook that flows through the woods. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> did come up that way, after all." ...|$|R
5000|$|In February 2006, Evans {{impressed}} for the Saints in an FAW Premier Cup semi-final against Wrexham, scoring an equaliser in extra-time {{to force}} the game into penalties, and joined Wrexham on a two-year deal in June 2006. He had made over 150 league and cup appearances for TNS. Wrexham manager, Denis Smith, said of him, [...] "He can {{be as good as}} he wants to be - <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> even do a good job for Wales. Steve's good in the air, can pass well and reads the game. He's older and wiser and benefits from experience." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jones {{arrives at}} the bank to pay in his takings, and cash a cheque. Pike refuses to cash his cheque because he is overdrawn. In Mainwaring's office, Mainwaring {{attempts}} {{to explain why he}} cannot cash the cheque. Jones can't understand why, having just paid money in, he can't take money out. Mainwaring complains that the cheque is stained, and Jones explains it is from a piece of liver. Mainwaring then asks what Jones is going to do about 'it', meaning his overdraft, and Jones replies that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> [...] "keep the cheques away from the meat". Mainwaring insists on coming round to Jones's shop after work to try to see where his overdraft has come from.|$|E
5000|$|Another leading {{contender}} was Epicharis, a Japanese-bred horse who qualified on the 2017 Road to the Kentucky Derby but who bypassed {{that race}} {{to focus on}} the Belmont. The New York Racing Association offers a $1-million bonus to any Japan-based horse who wins the Belmont. Epicharis entered a one-week isolation protocol on May 25 and shipped to Belmont Park on June 1. Unfortunately, Epicharis went lame on June 7 and was scratched on June 10 by the state veterinarian. [...] "He had foot soreness - heel soreness - earlier in the week and he just wasn’t sound," [...] said Scott Palmer, NYRA's equine medical director. [...] "In a week <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be ready, but we ran out of time. The right decision was made. The top priority is the horse." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nat's {{adventure}} {{was like}} this; I don't know how true it is; <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> got {{it out of}} a paper, or somewhere, but I will say this for him, that he DID know how to tell it. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> make anybody's flesh crawl, and he'd turn pale and hold his breath when he told it, and sometimes women and girls got so faint they couldn't stick it out. Well, it was this way, as near as I can remember: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph, <b>maybe</b> <b>he's</b> {{sorry and}} <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> isn't," [...] muttered Stanley. [...] "I guess {{he ought to}} have a thrashing. Anyway, I am done with him," [...] and he flung back the coat Tom had offered him.|$|R
6000|$|Wishing to {{give the}} old gentleman a chance, I dipped into translations. Some of these old fellows were {{not as bad as}} I had {{imagined}} them. A party named Homer had written some really interesting stuff. Here and there, <b>maybe,</b> <b>he</b> was a bit long-winded, but, taking him as a whole, there was [...] "go" [...] in him. There was another of them--Ovid was his name. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> tell a story, Ovid <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> had imagination. He was almost as good as [...] "Robinson Crusoe." [...] I thought it would please my professor, telling him that I was reading these, his favourite authors.|$|R
50|$|Criss (James Marsden) {{learns that}} Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is {{the boss of}} Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), then gives Liz an ultimatum: Jack or him. Liz chooses him, but because she has been doubting Criss lately due to Jack being in her head, also says that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> work on some things, angering Criss. Jack then deals with Devon Banks (Will Arnett), who tells him that in return for Jack getting his {{triplets}} into a prestigious school, he will stop attacking NBC for Tracy's homophobic comments. Jack pulls some favors, and does so, only for Devon {{to point out that}} Jack's daughter Liddy will now not get into the school, as Jack has exhausted his favors. Jack is upset at first, until he realizes, with the help of Tracy, that he had humble beginnings and became powerful, and he knows Liddy will do just fine.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Search Committee", Kevin {{describes}} [...] "The Botanical Gardens" [...] as [...] "Scranton's hidden gem", but warns Angela, who {{is heading}} there {{to have lunch}} with her boyfriend, the State Senator, not to eat any berries she doesn't recognize. Later, when some of the staff debate over whether they should tell Angela that her now fiancé is gay, Kevin comes up with a theory that if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get a Lesbian to marry him. He ultimately agrees that they shouldn't tell Angela to keep her happy. Later, when Erin uses a sock puppet as part of her plan to ask Andy out, Kevin says in a talking-head interview that he likes sock puppets, but wishes they would talk more about the alphabet. He says it's not for him, but if [...] "any kids are watching". He then tries to demonstrate saying the alphabet, but performs it poorly.|$|E
50|$|On Pi's {{first day}} of training, Pearl tells Pi {{that she could not}} live with herself if Pi were killed. Pi then reminds Pearl how she said that he would find his destiny on the reef, and he did when he met Cordelia. Stating now he is about to lose her just like how he lost his parents, Pi tells Pearl how he could not do {{anything}} to save them, and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not save Cordelia, but he will not give up without trying. Nerissa starts by telling Pi that Troy picks on anyone smaller than him, and he has never learned about things bigger than him, Nerissa says the ocean itself is bigger than Troy and if Pi can use the ocean against him, his own size would not matter. Nerissa leads Pi down a valley with obstacles, including razor-sharp elkhorn coral, burning fire coral, a long, narrow tunnel known as Bottleneck Alley, and finally a current known as the West Indies current, full of Portuguese man o' war that could kill someone Pi's size.|$|E
50|$|Since William Rutherford was a {{very capable}} mathematician, his motive for {{requesting}} a proof of a theorem that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> certainly have proved himself is unknown. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> posed the question {{as a challenge to}} his peers, or perhaps he hoped that the responses would yield a more elegant solution. However, it is clear from reading successive issues of the Ladies Diary inthe 1820s, that the Editor aimed to include a varied set of questions each year, with some suited for the exercise of beginners.|$|R
5000|$|Father {{told him}} hopeful sponsor to mind his own business, {{that he would}} take care of his family the way he wanted to and nobody was going to tell him what to do. Well, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> felt free the rest of his life, but real artistic success was never his. No doubt he was a great artist and had {{recognition}} in a certain arty circle, but ... <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have been as famous as Utrillo or Picasso ...
