5|$|The {{classical}} folklorist Adrienne <b>Mayor</b> <b>has</b> {{proposed that}} the griffin of mythology is based on dinosaur skeletons found in the Gobi Desert. She noted that griffins were said to inhabit the Scythian steppes that reached from the modern Ukraine to central Asia. Mayor draws a connection to Protoceratops, a frilled dinosaur that was commonly found in the Gobi. This dinosaur has features associated with griffins: they share sharp beaks, four legs, claws, similar size, and large eyes (or eye sockets {{in the case of}} the fossils), and the neck frill of Protoceratops, with large open holes, is consistent with descriptions of large ears or wings. However, the palaeontologist Mark Witton notes that the suggestion ignores pre-Mycenaean accounts, and has not found favour with archaeologists including N. Wyatt and T.F. Tartaron.|$|E

5|$|The town's {{coat of arms}} {{depicts the}} old castle that used {{to stand on the}} site of the former prison. The royal purple {{background}} represents Dorchester's status as part of the monarch's private estate, a position held since before the Domesday Book was published. The shield is divided into quarters, two depicting lions and two fleur-de-lis. These are copied from the shields of the troops from Dorset who took part in the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. The fleur-de-lis have a scattered arrangement which shows that permission for the armorial bearings was given before 1405, after which date the rights were varied by King Henry VI. The inscription 'Sigillum Bailivorum Dorcestre' translates as 'Seal of the Bailiffs of Dorchester'. The <b>mayor</b> <b>has</b> a similar seal of office, but this has the inscription ' Dorcestriensis Sig : Maioris'.|$|E
