25|$|A flow bench {{consists}} of an air pump of some sort, a metering element, pressure and temperature measuring instruments such as <b>manometers,</b> and various controls. The test piece is attached in series with the pump and measuring element and air is pumped through the whole system. Therefore, all the air passing through the metering element also passes through the test piece. Because the volume flow rate through the metering element is known and the flow through the test piece is the same, it is also known. The mass flow rate can be calculated using the known pressure and temperature data to calculate air densities, and multiplying by the volume flow rate.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} distributions {{across the}} test model {{have historically been}} measured by drilling many small holes along the airflow path, and using multi-tube <b>manometers</b> to measure the pressure at each hole. Pressure distributions can more conveniently be measured {{by the use of}} pressure-sensitive paint, in which higher local pressure is indicated by lowered fluorescence of the paint at that point. Pressure distributions can also be conveniently measured by the use of pressure-sensitive pressure belts, a recent development in which multiple ultra-miniaturized pressure sensor modules are integrated into a flexible strip. The strip is attached to the aerodynamic surface with tape, and it sends signals depicting the pressure distribution along its surface.|$|E
500|$|Mercury {{is used in}} thermometers, barometers, <b>manometers,</b> sphygmomanometers, float valves, mercury switches, mercury relays, {{fluorescent}} lamps and other devices, though concerns about the element's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alternatives such as alcohol- or galinstan-filled glass thermometers and thermistor- or infrared-based electronic instruments. [...] Likewise, mechanical pressure gauges and electronic strain gauge sensors have replaced mercury sphygmomanometers. Mercury remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam for dental restoration in some locales. It is used in fluorescent lighting. Electricity passed through mercury vapor in a fluorescent lamp produces short-wave ultraviolet light which then causes the phosphor in the tube to fluoresce, making visible light.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — U-Tube <b>Manometer</b> is used {{to measure}} pressure. It is {{calibrated}} using the variation in capacitance. In U-tube <b>manometer,</b> {{the relation between the}} level of mercury and the capacitance developed across the copper plates of the <b>manometer</b> is found to be highly non-linear. Due to its non-predictive nature and nonlinear relationship, artificial intelligence techniques are used to calibrate the system. The artificial intelligence technique used here is Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The system is implemented using the microcontroller ARM Cortex-M 3. In U-Tube <b>Manometer,</b> the capacitance values obtained from capacitive level sensor are converted into frequency through an astable multivibrator. The counted frequencies are estimated using the Kalman Filter. The Kalman filter is employed to suppress the abnormalities from minute capacitance change of measurements for promoting efficiency in frequency estimation and amplitude estimation of the distorted signal. After frequency estimation, training is done using the ANFIS. The implemented hardware can be used to efficiently calibrate the U-Tube <b>manometer.</b> This system shows that the ANFIS can be implemented in hardware and can be used to calibrate the non-linear systems effectively.
