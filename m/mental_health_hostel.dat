40|$|From 1997 to 2001, several {{state legislatures}} passed laws mandating that {{employers}} must offer <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> insurance coverage if they provide general medical health benefits. Previous research {{has failed to}} determine whether these mandates have had a causal effect on access to mental healthcare and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> outcomes. This dissertation employs a difference-in-differences estimation strategy to evaluate the effect of three types of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> mandates (full parity, minimum mandated benefits, and mandated offering) on the rate of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> insurance coverage, the utilization of mental healthcare services, and four measures of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> outcomes using two waves of data from the National Survey of Alcohol, Drug and <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> Problems. The results suggest that full parity <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> mandates broadly {{increase the likelihood of}} <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> insurance coverage among individuals with employer-sponsored health insurance, but decrease the probability of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> insurance coverage among individuals with employer-sponsored health insurance who are in poor <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> status. Additionally, <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> mandates broadly cause an increase in utilization of mental healthcare services with the effect increasing with the strength of the mandate. Finally, <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> mandates do not appear to {{have a significant effect on}} the probability of having major depression disorder, worker unemployment and worker absenteeism. However, they do significantly and negatively affect a measure of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> status, the social functioning score. Therefore, mandates improved <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> insurance coverage for the marginal patient, but worsened coverage for individuals with poor <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> status, thus resulting in a decline in <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> status outcomes across the whole sample. Overall, this dissertation finds evidence suggesting that state mandates for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> are not an effective means for improving <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> outcomes and for those in poor <b>mental</b> <b>health,</b> they actually have the adverse effect of worsening coverage as well as <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> status. ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Most {{people with}} <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> {{problems}} {{do not use}} <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services, resulting in poor psychiatric outcomes and greater illness burden. Although perceiving the need for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care was identified {{to be a key}} factor for service use, factors that explain differences in perceived need for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care are incompletely understood. The present paper investigates the role of illness representations in predicting perceived need for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care. METHODS: In a community sample of 202 persons currently distressed by symptoms related to mental illness, illness representations were assessed using the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire and perceived need for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care was measured by the Self-Appraisal of Illness Questionnaire. Multiple linear regression models were used to determine the association between a person's illness representations and the level of perceived need for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care. RESULTS: Two illness representations were positively associated with perceived need for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care: the belief that treatment could improve the current <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problem and the attribution of experienced symptoms to a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problem. Increased perceived need for care was related to current <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> service use.

40|$|Background: Although mental {{disorders}} {{is of great}} public health concern among Kenyan populations, <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services remain poor. Some of the reasons attributed to delivery of poor <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services are unfavourable work environment and lack of policy guidelines including a conceptual model of nursing. Quality of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> nursing care significantly impacts on general <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services in Kenya since they are predominantly provided by nurses. Lack of a model to guide care and improve <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services created {{the need to develop}} the Kenyan Human Interaction Model for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> nursing practice. Purpose: The {{purpose of the study was}} to discover and develop a Kenyan model for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> nursing guided by two research questions, namely: What are the views of Kenyan <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> nurses with regards to human being, environment, <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> nursing and <b>mental</b> health: What is the appropriate model for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> nursing practice in Kenya? Methodology: Straussian Grounded Theory method was used in the study. Data were collected for 6 months through in-depth interviews with 33 registered <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> nurses selected by open, purposive and theoretical sampling methods. Inductive and deductive data analysis of the nurses' description of their views and recommendations on the nursing metaparadigms were done Findings: A substantive theory of the Kenyan Human Interaction Model for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> nursing practice was developed. The four metaparadigm concepts of the discovered theory are: 1. Human being as a unique biopsychosocio-spiritual being and causal condition 2. Environment consisting of homely and hostile dimensions 3. <b>Mental</b> <b>health</b> nursing as a holistic care founded on human interaction 4. <b>Mental</b> <b>health</b> (consequence of holistic care) with optimum and illness dimensions. <b>Mental</b> <b>health</b> nursing was discovered as the central phenomena interacting with its causal, contexts and intervening conditions to determine the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> dimension of the human being. The quality of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> nursing determines the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> dimensions and is influenced by the environment and nurses' characteristics as contexts and intervening conditions respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Mental</b> <b>health</b> {{problems}} are prevalent and costly in working populations. Workplace interventions to address common <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems have evolved relatively independently along three main threads or disciplinary traditions: medicine, public health, and psychology. In this Debate piece, {{we argue that}} these three threads need to be integrated to optimise the prevention of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems in working populations. DISCUSSION: To realise the greatest population <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> benefits, workplace <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> intervention needs to comprehensively 1) protect <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> by reducing work-related risk factors for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems; 2) promote <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> by developing {{the positive aspects of}} work as well as worker strengths and positive capacities; and 3) address <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems among working people regardless of cause.

This study examines the effects of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> screening and service delivery on perceived future criminal justice interactions— arrest and incarceration—among adjudicated youth (n= 7, 073) housed in correctional facilities. Secondary data were used to examine trauma histories, <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> needs, and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> screening and service delivery. Significant relationships between traumatic events and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems were found, along with relationships between <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> screening and service delivery. Most interestingly, results pointed to the strong inverse relationship between <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> service delivery and youth’s perceived likelihood for recidivism. These findings show the promise of juvenile justice systems appropriately responding to the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> concerns of youth...|$|R

This paper presents the qualitative findings from national consultations about the framework. Content analysis of data was undertaken, and the findings show four key themes. First, the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> content of curricula should be increased; second, overall <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> nursing leadership should be strengthened; third, <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> consumer participation should be increased in all aspects of curricula; and finally, a repository should be established for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> teaching resources...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mental</b> <b>health</b> and <b>mental</b> illness are {{mounting}} {{concerns in}} the United States. It is estimated that by 2020, mental illness will be the second leading cause of mortality in the United States. These rising rates {{have been attributed to}} a lack of access to <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care, lack of knowledge regarding <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> treatment options, and stigma concerning <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> disorders. In response to this potential crisis, researchers have been challenged to improve <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> literacy at the individual and community levels. Health promotion efforts, which have shown efficacy in improving knowledge of physical health concerns, have also been found efficacious in <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> intervention programming. In particular, health fairs {{have been found to be}} an efficient and effective means for organizations to perform community health outreach functions. ^ On November 15, 2008, a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> fair was held at <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> America (MHA) of Tippecanoe County, a community <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> center serving the Greater Lafayette, Indiana Community. The present study presents a description and process evaluation of this <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> fair. Proposed objectives for the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> fair were: (1) increased community visibility of MHA of Tippecanoe County; (2) increased community involvement with MHA of Tippecanoe County; (3) increased community awareness of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> issues. Eighty-seven individuals attended the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> fair and 52 responded to an event assessment. Results of the event assessments indicated that the objectives of the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> fair were met. The <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> fair was critiqued using the CDC Framework for Program Evaluation in Public Health. Although not originally guided by a formal evaluation framework, process information derived from the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> fair may be useful for community agencies interested in <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> intervention programming. ...|$|R
