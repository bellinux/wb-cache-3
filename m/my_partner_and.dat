2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Richard Matheson and Carol Serling {{produced}} an outline for a two-hour made-for-TV movie which would feature Matheson adaptations of three yet-unfilmed Rod Serling short stories. Outlines {{for such a}} production were rejected by CBS until early 1994, when Serling's widow discovered a complete shooting script ("Where the Dead Are") authored by her late husband, while rummaging through their garage. Serling showed the forgotten script to producers Michael O'Hara and Laurence Horowitz, who were significantly impressed by it. [...] "I had a pile of scripts, which I usually procrastinate about reading. But I read this one right away and, after 30 pages, called <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "I love it," [...] recalled O'Hara. [...] "This is pure imagination, a period piece, literate – some might say wordy. If Rod Serling's name weren't on it, it wouldn't {{have a chance at}} getting made." ...|$|E

60|$|Before {{anything}} {{could be said}} between <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> <b>and</b> me, however, the Avenger had come off the Severn, and we received peremptory orders to heave to.|$|E
6000|$|... “It’s puzzling,” Jimmy agreed. “There’s {{obviously}} a mystery; but, after talking the thing over, <b>my</b> <b>partners</b> <b>and</b> I {{decided that we}} wouldn’t try to unravel it.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I’m afraid they’re {{not very}} ambitious, {{but they may}} lead to something. <b>My</b> <b>partners</b> <b>and</b> I intend to start a small towing and {{transport}} business with the salvage money.” ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{will have}} your back until WrestleMania. I’ve turned against all <b>my</b> <b>partners</b> <b>and</b> more importantly, I’ve stabbed {{all my friends}} in the back. But with you, John, it’s different. Shawn Michaels commenting on his future WWE Championship match against John Cena.|$|R
6000|$|... "Featherstone's <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> <b>and</b> I {{took his}} baggage by mistake {{when we left}} a small Canadian town," [...] he said, and added after a pause: [...] "I expect the {{explanation}} sounds rather lame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are going}} to save <b>my</b> <b>partner,</b> <b>and</b> not to do {{something}} that may help you in your political schemes," [...] he said. [...] "It may save trouble if you bear this in mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Smoke {{refused to}} listen. [...] "Besides," [...] he said, [...] "I've got about forty feet of rope cached where {{we take the}} ice. <b>My</b> <b>partner</b> <b>and</b> I used it coming over. It will be a cinch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When the cry {{was raised}} {{that the money}} had gone the greater portion of the crowd started in pursuit, an' <b>my</b> <b>partners</b> <b>and</b> I managed to hold our own {{until a couple of}} constables came up. They took charge of the team, and gave us a chance to slip through the gates." ...|$|R
50|$|On any battlefield, at {{any point}} of the compass I will excel. I will set the example for all others to emulate. At {{the tip of the}} spear, I will teach and prepare others to seek out, dismantle, and destroy our common enemies. I will fight side by side with <b>my</b> <b>partners</b> <b>and</b> will be the first in and last out of any mission.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} other, nodding. [...] "I've been very busy of late owing to <b>my</b> <b>partner's</b> illness, <b>and</b> you are {{attending}} several people I {{want to hear}} about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! to the Temple, as my {{daughter}} calls our house. <b>My</b> <b>partner</b> <b>and</b> I are labour agents, we recruit natives for the Kimberley Mines," [...] {{he said in}} explanation, adding, [...] "Where do you propose to shoot?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mamma, do pray, pray begin; the {{afternoon}} is wasting like nothing!" [...] cried Conrade of the much-tried patience. [...] "And Aunt Rachel," [...] he added, in his magnanimity, [...] "you shall be <b>my</b> <b>partner,</b> <b>and</b> I'll teach you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, {{has been}} <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> <b>and</b> helper {{in many of}} my most {{successful}} cases, and I {{have no doubt that}} he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Instigated <b>my</b> <b>partner's</b> murder, <b>and</b> twice {{attempted}} my own life," [...] Dane {{answered in}} breathless haste. [...] "But I'm {{in no mood}} to waste time. Will you hire me that surf-boat?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In another article, he mentions, “I {{have never}} {{been the same since}} that fateful day when I met the Palestinians who are today <b>my</b> friends, <b>partners</b> <b>and</b> life guides.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Seaforth {{shook his}} grasp off. [...] "You are <b>my</b> <b>partner,</b> Harry, <b>and</b> the only friend I have. God send you safe through with it. Now, {{is there any}} use in looking for the fellow with the lariat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Alton {{laid down}} the paddle, and took off his hat. [...] "Jimmy," [...] he said solemnly, [...] "is dead. He was <b>my</b> <b>partner,</b> <b>and</b> his wife {{is a friend of}} mine. She was in some ways very like you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall expose you, {{knowing that}} I have kept your guilty secret {{to the last}} moment--and knowing what I owe to <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> <b>and</b> to myself. You have still four days to spare. Make {{the most of your}} time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense! He was <b>my</b> <b>partner.</b> <b>And</b> {{you must}} have known him since at Boomville. Come! He got forty shares of Ditch stock--through you--at 110, which were worth about 80! SOMEBODY must have made money enough by it to {{remember}} him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can't be {{any worse}} off than I am," [...] <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> replied, <b>and</b> then we both laughed softly. An {{acknowledgment}} of our timorousness seemed to hearten us, and we worked the paddles in a more whole-souled fashion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look at {{that fellow}} who is standin' on his tiptoes {{to look in}} at the window!" [...] <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> whispered, <b>and</b> obeying, I saw that miserable cur whom we had twice captured, and who had {{contrived}} to escape us {{the same number of}} times.|$|R
5000|$|The uncensored hook goes: [...] "Money, hoes, {{cars and}} clothes, that's how all my niggas roll / Blowing dro on 24's, that's how all my niggas roll".

6000|$|... "You {{must help}} yourselves while we get sail upon the boat," [...] said Vane. [...] "The saloon's at your disposal, <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> <b>and</b> I have the fo'c'sle. You will notice there are {{blankets}} yonder, and as we'll have smooth water {{most of the}} way you should get some sleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me {{ask your}} pardon," [...] he said, [...] "in the {{presence}} of <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> <b>and</b> in {{the presence of}} David Glenney, who took charge of your letter. Madame Fontaine, I speak the plain truth, in the plainest words, when I tell you that I am ashamed of myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am a paint factory drummer who {{has never}} had the {{opportunities}} you have enjoyed; but so long as we're {{up here in the}} wilds the only thing that counts is that we're men with the same weaknesses and feelings.

6000|$|... "It's from <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> in Canada, <b>and</b> I'm sure you'll be {{interested}} to bear it." [...] He read the message aloud: [...] "'Come. Struck it. Tell Challoner.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|Alton {{seemed to}} sigh. [...] "I am," [...] he said simply, [...] "Alton of Somasco, and I fancy {{now and then}} that was all I was meant to be. You are <b>my</b> <b>partner,</b> Charley, <b>and</b> {{it would take a}} good deal more than Carnaby to {{separate}} you and me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You are morbid, Culmeny. If {{they can}} only steer clear of treachery, by the Lord, those two lads will cut their way out {{in spite of all}} the savages in Africa. I know the one whose father was <b>my</b> <b>partner,</b> <b>and</b> I know your son. If my own brother told me he had seen them beaten, I would not believe him." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{was really}} loath {{to part with}} him; but {{considering}} the prospect of advantage, which was really considerable, {{and that he was}} a young fellow as likely to do well in it as any I knew, I inclined to let him go; but first I told him, I would consult <b>my</b> <b>partner,</b> <b>and</b> give him an answer the next day. <b>My</b> <b>partner</b> <b>and</b> I discoursed about it, and my partner made a most generous offer: he told me, [...] "You know it has been an unlucky ship, and we both resolve not to go to sea in it again; if your steward (so he called my man) will venture the voyage, I'll leave my share of the vessel to him, and let him make the best of it; and if we live to meet in England, and he meets with success abroad, he shall account for one half of the profits of the ship's freight to us, the other shall be his own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you see, {{it was not}} the coroner's {{business}} nor the jury's business, to {{know better}} than the medical officer for the district, on whose evidence they relied. But it is my business; for the said officer is <b>my</b> <b>partner,</b> <b>and,</b> but for me, our business would be worth very little. He is about as ignorant and easy-going an excellent old fellow as ever let a life slip out of his hands." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{about twelve}} o'clock I missed <b>my</b> <b>partner's</b> voice <b>and</b> looking about saw {{only two of}} the packhorses following.

I examined the horse's foot and found a thin stream of arterial blood spouting out.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And now,' said Daniel, {{looking at}} his watch, 'as time and tide wait for no man, <b>my</b> trusty <b>partner,</b> <b>and</b> as I am ready for starting, bag and baggage, at the gate below, let me say a last word. I want you to grant a request of mine.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} intrude," [...] he said simply, [...] "but I came {{only to see}} your father. I have made an awful blunder--more than a blunder, I think--a FRAUD. Believing that I was rich, I {{purchased}} your father's claim for <b>my</b> <b>partners,</b> <b>and</b> gave him <b>my</b> promissory note. I came here to give him back his claim--for that note can NEVER be paid! I have just been to the bank; I find I have made a stupid mistake {{in the name of}} the shares upon which I based my belief in my wealth. The ones I own are worthless--am as poor as ever--I am even poorer, for I owe your father money I can never pay!" ...|$|R
