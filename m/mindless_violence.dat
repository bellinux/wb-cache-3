5000|$|Ian Jane of DVD Talk rated it 2.5/5 {{stars and}} wrote, [...] "Game Of Death {{is not a}} film in the least bit {{concerned}} with strong characters or even believability but it does offer up enough <b>mindless</b> action and <b>violence</b> to keep and hold the pace."

Other commentators suggest that fight sequences and violence in comics serve as a social outlet for otherwise dangerous impulses. Shōnen manga and its extreme warriorship have been parodied, for example, in Mine Yoshizakis screwball comedy Sgt. Frog (Keroro Gunso), about a platoon of slacker alien frogs who invade the Earth and end up free-loading off the Hinata family in Tokyo.|$|R

2500|$|Ulfa {{during its}} heydays (late eighties and nineties {{of the last}} century) was quite popular among many {{indigenous}} Assamese people of the Brahmaputra valley. Majority of the supporters [...] felt that a powerful organisation was necessary to get {{the voice of a}} peripheral region heard in the corridors of power in Lutyen’s Delhi. But gradually, the organisation’s undue emphasis on collection of money and weapons in the name of furthering the ‘revolution’ led to <b>mindless</b> <b>violence</b> throughout the state. It witnessed a period marked by growing disillusionment and anger amid its supporters. In their bloody conflict with the security agencies, many innocent people lost their lives and several thousands were permanently maimed. It is estimated that more than ten thousand local youths perished during that turbulent period. In the process, owing to the twin factors of increasing pressure by the security agencies and dwindling support among its core sympathisers, its importance in Assam has been steadily declined.|$|E
40|$|Most sub-Saharan states cannot protect {{themselves}} from major military threats, especially extra-continental ones. From {{the perspective of the}} big international players the question is: should Africa be protected? In this collection of essays, the impact of Africa's global marginalisation is duly noted. This fundamental facet of Africa's security dilemma, however, is not analysed in any meaningful way. True, the usual malaises, including 'ethnic nationalism', are paraded, but {{there is no mention of}} the current debate on how Africa's 'ethnic' wars are interpreted by the international media, and its assumed impact on humanitarian and military intervention. If they have not done so already, the editors should read Tim Allen and Jean Seaton's new book, The Media of Conflict. Here the implications of the so-called second scramble for Africa, including the role of aid agencies and the International Monetary Fund, are scrutinised. Seaton and Allen reject the notion of <b>mindless,</b> primordial <b>violence</b> in Africa, and instead examine the repercussions of foreign intervention (most egregiously French meddling in Rwanda) as well as the rational economic motivations of the assorted warlords. </p...|$|R
50|$|In August 1947 in {{what was}} the final cynical act of a {{collapsing}} empire, the British left old India divided. Arbitrary lines were drawn on the map of India, dividing not only the country but also provinces, in particular the old Punjab Province (British India). The results of partition were catastrophic. All {{in the name of}} religion and nationalism, people who had lived together in harmony for centuries committed <b>mindless</b> acts of <b>violence</b> against each other resulting in over one million deaths that included Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus. An estimated 75,000 women were raped and over twelve million people were uprooted. Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India and Muslims to Pakistan.|$|R
5000|$|On April 4, 1968, Kennedy {{learned of}} the {{assassination}} of Martin Luther King Jr. and gave a heartfelt impromptu speech in Indianapolis's inner city, calling for a reconciliation between the races. The address {{was the first time}} Kennedy spoke publicly about his brother's killing. Riots broke out in 60 cities in the wake of King's death, but not in Indianapolis, a fact many attribute to the effect of this speech. Kennedy addressed the City Club of Cleveland the next day, on April 5, 1968, delivering the famous On the <b>Mindless</b> Menace of <b>Violence</b> speech. He attended King's funeral, accompanied by Jacqueline and Ted Kennedy. He was described as being the [...] "only white politician to hear only cheers and applause." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{show has}} been {{described}} as cartoonish and likened to Tom and Jerry. [...] Dean P. of the Courier-Mail described the violence in the show as [...] "hypocritical" [...] and that [...] "the morality of giving the impression that a hail of bullets does no-one any harm is ignored. [...] After all, Tom and Jerry survived all sorts of mayhem for years with no ill-effects." [...] Television reviewer Ric Meyers joked that the A-Team used [...] "antineutron bullets—they destroy property for miles around, but never harm a human being". [...] According to certain estimates, an episode of the A-Team held up to 46 violent acts. Stephen J. Cannell, co-creator of the show responds: [...] "They were determined to make a point, and we were too big a target to resist. Cartoon violence is a scapegoat issue." [...] Originally, The A-Team's status as a hit show remained strong, but it ultimately lost out to more family-oriented shows such as The Cosby Show, Who's the Boss? and Growing Pains. [...] John J. O'Connor of The New York Times wrote in a 1986 article that [...] "...a substantial number of viewers, if the ratings in recent months are to be believed, are clearly fed up with <b>mindless</b> <b>violence</b> of the car-chasing, fist-slugging variety".|$|E
2500|$|Ward {{was killed}} in the Battle of Cixi and his {{successor}} H. A. Burgevine, an American was disliked by the Imperial Chinese authorities. Burgevine was an unsavory character known for his greed and for being an alcoholic. Moreover, Burgevine made little effort to hide his racism, and his relations with the Chinese were very difficult at the best of times. Li Hongzhang, the governor of the Jiangsu province, requested Staveley to appoint a British officer to command the contingent. Staveley selected Gordon, who had been made a brevet major in December 1862 and the nomination was approved by the British government. Given Burgevine's alcoholism, open corruption, and a tendency to engage in acts of <b>mindless</b> <b>violence</b> when drunk, the Chinese wanted [...] "a man of good temper, of clean hands and a steady economist" [...] as his replacement. These requirements led Staveley to choose Gordon. Li was impressed with Gordon, writing:It is a direct blessing from Heaven, the coming of this British Gordon. ... He is superior in manner and bearing to any of the foreigners whom I have come into contact with, and does not show outwardly that conceit which makes most of them repugnant in my sight...What an elixir for a heavy heart-to see this splendid Englishman fight! ... If there is anything that I admire nearly as much as the superb scholarship of Zeng Guofan, it is the military qualities of this fine officer. He is a glorious fellow!...With his many faults, his pride, his temper, and his never-ending demand for money – but he is a noble man, and in spite of all I have said to him or about him, I will ever think most highly of him. ... He is an honest man, but difficult to get on with. Gordon was honest and incorruptible, and unlike many Chinese officers, did not steal the money that was meant to pay his men, but rather insisted on paying the Ever Victorious Army on time and in full. Gordon's insistence on paying his men meant that he always pressing the Imperial government for money, something which often irritated the mandarins who did not understand why Gordon did not just let his men loot and plunder as a compensation for wages. Gordon designed the uniform for the Ever Victorious Army, which consisted of black boots together with turbans, jackets and trousers that were all green while his personal bodyguard of 300 men wore blue uniforms.|$|E

5000|$|First single 'Future Rights' was {{something}} of a hit in 1979 in the Kent punk scene (at least in Thanet), and the Rivals drew (sometimes ambivalent) comparisons to the already-defunct Sex Pistols.
