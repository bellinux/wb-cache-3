5000|$|A helper {{card with}} an Intel 8088 {{processor}} allowed the NKC to run MS-DOS. Systems could be customized to handle many different peripherals including PS/2-keyboard, 3½" [...] floppy disks, IDE-hard drives and modern storage. Users have developed new cards which replaced the former specialized components. For instance, a system could contain a new graphics card (with VGA connector), one serial port, a sound card, PC keyboard and a <b>mouse</b> <b>connector.</b> Another system configuration that supports booting via the IDE-interface {{has been developed}} for the 68xxx family.|$|E
5000|$|The PS/2 port is a 6-pin mini-DIN {{connector}} {{used for}} connecting some keyboards and mice to a PC compatible computer system. Its {{name comes from}} the IBM Personal System/2 series of personal computers, with which it was introduced in 1987. The PS/2 <b>mouse</b> <b>connector</b> generally replaced the older DE-9 RS-232 [...] "serial mouse" [...] connector, while the PS/2 keyboard connector replaced the larger 5-pin/180° DIN connector used in the IBM PC/AT design. The PS/2 designs on keyboard and mouse interfaces are electrically similar and employ the same communication protocol. However, unlike the otherwise similar Apple Desktop Bus connector used by Apple, a given system's keyboard and mouse port may not be interchangeable since the two devices use {{a different set of}} commands.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{mechanical}} aspects of the slot specifications are still used in current PCs. A few systems still come with PS/2 style keyboard and <b>mouse</b> <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|ATX {{also made}} the PS/2-style mini-DIN {{keyboard}} and <b>mouse</b> <b>connectors</b> ubiquitous. AT systems used a 5-pin DIN connector for the keyboard and were generally used with serial port mice (although PS/2 mouse ports were also found on some systems). Many modern motherboards are phasing out the PS/2-style keyboard and <b>mouse</b> <b>connectors</b> {{in favor of the}} more modern Universal Serial Bus. Other legacy connectors that are slowly being phased out of modern ATX motherboards include 25-pin parallel ports and 9-pin RS-232 serial ports. In their place are onboard peripheral ports such as Ethernet, FireWire, eSATA, audio ports (both analog and S/PDIF), video (analog D-sub, DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort) and extra USB ports.|$|R

5000|$|Each type of coupler is {{identified}} by a standard sheet number. For appliance couplers {{this consists of}} the letter [...] "C" [...] followed by a number, where the standard sheet for the male appliance inlet is 1 higher than the sheet for the corresponding female cable connector. Many types of coupler also have common names. The most common ones are IEC connector for the common C13 and C14, the figure-8 connector for C7 and C8, and cloverleaf connector or Mickey <b>Mouse</b> <b>connector</b> for the C5/C6. Kettle plug is a colloquial term used for the high-temperature C16 appliance inlet (and sometimes, wrongly, for the mating C15 female connector). [...] "Kettle plug" [...] is sometimes mistakenly {{used to refer to}} regular temperature-rated C13 and C14 connectors, which should not be used with heating appliances.|$|E
5000|$|The Smart Display was a {{battery-powered}} 10" [...] or 15" [...] LCD monitor with a touchscreen (similar in {{size and}} shape to a Tablet PC), connecting to a PC over an 802.11b WiFi network, with input via Transcriber (similar to Graffiti) or a pop-up soft-keyboard for text entry, and built-in speakers. Some models had a docking unit with wired PC, keyboard and <b>mouse</b> <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
25|$|A2M4015: An Apple Mouse {{packaged}} for the IIc, it {{coincided with}} a minor change in the <b>mouse</b> mechanism and <b>connector</b> style.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} used by several {{different}} products, most notably on the original IBM Model M keyboard with a detachable cable, and on HP HIL devices (such as keyboards and <b>mice).</b> The <b>connector</b> was also used by AMF for their line of Accuscore automatic scoring systems for bowling. Some of the SDL connectors are still manufactured but are no longer common on consumer electronic devices.|$|R
50|$|Note: Version 8.0 {{and above}} dropped PS/2 {{support for the}} {{following}} list. As even adapters cannot assist, Microsoft keeps version 7.1 as an offered download for users who still own <b>mice</b> with PS/2 <b>connectors</b> (instead of USB).|$|R
50|$|PS/2 <b>mouse</b> and {{keyboard}} <b>connectors</b> {{have also}} been used in non-IBM PC-compatible computer systems, such as the DEC AlphaStation line, early IBM RS/6000 CHRP machines and SGI Indy, Indigo 2, and newer (Octane, etc.) computers. Various Macintosh clone computers from the late 1990s featured PS/2 mouse and keyboard ports, including the Motorola StarMax and the Power Computing PowerBase.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the context}} of {{consumer}} electronics, the term [...] "DIN connector" [...] commonly refers {{to a member of}} a family of circular connectors that were initially standardized by DIN for analog audio signals. Some of these connectors have also been used in analog video applications, for power connections and for digital interfaces such as MIDI or the IBM AT computer keyboard (later PS/2 connectors for keyboard and <b>mouse</b> are Mini-DIN <b>connectors).</b> The original DIN standards for these connectors are no longer in print and have been replaced with the equivalent international standard IEC 60130-9.|$|R
