40|$|Scarlet-tufted <b>malachite</b> <b>sunbirds</b> (Nectarinia johnstoni) are {{endemic to}} the alpine zones of East African mountains. On Mount Kenya they feed almost {{exclusively}} on the nectar of Lobelia telekii flowers. Males are resident on their territories all year and defend L. telekii inflorescences from conspecifics. Males are bright iridescent green, with scarlet pectoral tufts which are displayed prominently during aggressive interactions with other males. We investigated the role of pectoral tufts in territory defence using natural variation and experimental manipulation. Males with naturally large pectoral tufts defended more L. telekii inflorescences than males with smaller tufts, and achieved a higher reproductive success. Males were subjected {{to one of three}} experimental treatments - having their pectoral tufts enlarged, reduced or manipulated but kept at the same size. Males with reduced tufts spend more time in aggressive interactions than the control males, the interactions lasted longer and they lost a number of inflorescences to neighbours. Males with enlarged pectoral tufts increased the number of inflorescences defended.

40|$|Scarlet-tufted <b>malachite</b> <b>sunbirds</b> (Neetarinia johnstoni) are {{endemic to}} the high {{altitude}} zones of East African mountains. On Mount Kenya the males are resident and territorial all year. The females arrive {{over an extended period}} {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season, after spending the non-breeding season in nomadic flocks at slightly lower elevations. Males are bright iridescent green with elongated central tail feathers, which are displayed during courtship. We examined the role of the tail in mate choice using natural variation and investigated the influence of tail length on male time budgets by experimental manipulation. Territorial males that paired had longer tails than territorial males which remained unpaired. Males with naturally long tails started breeding earlier, resulting in fledglings being produced earlier in the season when the weather was more clement. Birds which bred together in one year were paired together in the next year if they both survived. Thus the male's tail may only be involved as a cue in the formation of new pairs. Males which were already paired were subjected to one of three experimental treatments - having their tail elongated, shortened, or manipulated but kept at the same length. Males with experimentally shortened tails spent more time in flight and hawked for flying insects with a higher efficiency than control males. Both control and elongated tail males reduced the amount of time in flight and had a lower hawking efficiency after manipulation. These results suggest that the long tail of male scarlet-tufted <b>malachite</b> <b>sunbirds</b> is a handicap. The factors influencing the reproductive success of a pair are discussed. © 1992 Springer-Verlag. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMost of {{the species}} in the large African genus Kniphofia have floral traits that conform to the bird {{pollination}} syndrome, however there has been very little empirical work to confirm that birds are effective pollinators of Kniphofia species. From selective exclusion experiments, behavioural observations and pollen load analyses, we identified Amethyst Sunbirds (Chalcomitra amethystina) and <b>Malachite</b> <b>Sunbirds</b> (Nectarinia famosa) as the primary pollinators in two populations of Kniphofia laxiflora, with bees playing a smaller role. Bird visitors obtain moderate volumes (∼ 9 µl) of relatively concentrated (∼ 15 %) hexose-rich nectar in the flowers. This species is shown to be genetically self-incompatible, and thus reliant on pollinator visits for seed set. Although mountain pride butterflies (Aeropetes tulbaghia) {{have been identified as}} important pollinators of this species at two other populations, they did not occur at the two populations we studied...|$|R

40|$|Scarlet-tufted <b>malachite</b> <b>sunbirds,</b> Nectarinia johnstoni, are {{endemic to}} the alpine zones of East African mountains. On Mount Kenya they feed almost {{exclusively}} on the nectar of Lobelia telekii flowers. Males are bright iridescent green, with red pectoral tufts and elongated central tail feathers. The pectoral tufts are used to mediate male-male competition for territories and the long tail may be important in mate choice. The pectoral tufts and the tails of males measured in both 1989 and 1990 increased between years. This increase {{could be due to}} age or to differences in condition of the males in the two years. There was an increase in the population tail length and pectoral tuft size of the same magnitude as the change seen in known males which suggests that an age effect is unlikely. The density of L. telekii inflorescences increased between the two years, so more food was available in 1990 than in 1989. Weather records and data from breeding success also suggest that conditions in 1989 were harsher than in 1990. The available information suggests that the size of pectoral tufts and tail length are influenced by environmental conditions rather than male age. © 1991 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

40|$|A {{prediction}} of handicap and signalling theories {{is that there}} should be a positive relationship between ornament size and viability. This prediction was tested in scarlet-tufted <b>malachite</b> <b>sunbirds</b> (Nectarinia johnstoni). These birds are endemic to the high-altitude zones of East African mountains. They are bright iridescent green with elongated central tail feathers and red pectoral tufts. The elongated tail is believed to be a mate choice cue, and the red tufts play a role in aggressive encounters between males. As adults, they feed almost exclusively on the nectar of Lobelia telekii flowers, which males defend from conspecifics. The long term survival of individually identifiable males colour-marked in 1989 and 1990 was investigated. Territorial adult males had an average annual survival rate of 72 %, which is at the top of the range reported for tropical birds. The effects of morphology and territory characteristics on male survival were examined by adding covariates to the survival model. This analysis showed that male N. johnstoni with longer tails had a higher probability of survival than did short-tailed males. There was no apparent relation between tuft size or the number of L. telekii inflorescences on the territory and survival. The results presented here suggest that long-tailed males may be of intrinsically higher quality than are shorter tailed males. If this is true then females may benefit by using this trait as a mate choice cue through increased viability of their offspring. © 2003 The Linnean Society of London.

40|$|Elaborate sexual {{ornaments}} {{are found}} in many species, {{and some of them}} have been shown to have important functional roles. What limits the development of such ornaments ? The fluctuating asymmetry hypothesis proposes that high-quality individuals will produce large symmetrical ornaments, the converse being true for low-quality individuals. Negative relations between ornament size and asymmetry have been demonstrated and have been taken as supporting evidence for this hypothesis. Asymmetry in the tail ornament of male scarlet-tufted <b>malachite</b> <b>sunbirds</b> ((Nectarinia johnstoni) was investigated. During this process we discovered various problems in the theory and methods of analysis; we illustrate some of these using the sunbird data. We show that, because there are various ways of presenting the data, it is impossible to fail to obtain relations between asymmetry and some measures of trait size. This illustrates the problem that there is no clear null hypothesis for these analyses, and we discuss various possibilities. Fluctuating asymmetry theory cannot necessarily be applied to traits which are composed of more than one unit, and we discuss why similar trends have been found in these multi-component traits and single-unit traits. It is possible that aerodynamic and mechanical constraints may force symmetry on larger ornaments; this may also explain why similar trends have sometimes been found in the ornaments of the two sexes. We conclude that this hypothesis may not provide an adequate explanation for the honesty of ornamentation. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWhile the {{pollination}} {{ecology of}} many Aloe species is well-documented, knowledge on aloe seed ecology, and hence aloe reproductive ecology {{in its entirety}} is limited. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the reproductive ecology of Aloe plicatilis, a Cape fynbos tree aloe endemic to the Cape Winelands, South Africa. Results from a pollinator exclusion experiment conducted at an A. plicatilis population on Paarl mountain suggests pollination primarily by insects, although bird visitation significantly increased seed set/fruit indicating possible co-pollination with insects. The species' long-tubed flowers and production of concentrated nectar, with observations of <b>malachite</b> <b>sunbirds</b> as the most common avian visitors to A. plicatilis flowers indicate the importance of long-billed specialist avian nectarivores as floral visitors. Analysis of the relationship between plant size and inflorescence production for five populations combined revealed a significant, positive linear relationship between plant size and the logarithm of the number of inflorescences/plant. Natural fruit and seed set determined for three populations (1325, 27, 930 and 251, 616 seeds/population) suggests low reproductive output compared to several other Aloe species. The smallest (31 individuals) and least dense (75 plants/ha) A. plicatilis population produced the lowest seed set/plant (128 seeds) and per population (1325 seeds), suggesting an Allee effect. Evaluation of seed dispersal potential showed that potential dispersal distances were approximately three times the canopy height; however, the occurrence of A. plicatilis on mountains isolated from more continuous mountain ranges on which the species also occurs suggests the possibility of long-distance dispersal by strong, gusty, summer winds. Soil seed bank samples collected from 13 populations yielded close to zero seedling emergence, indicating the absence of persistent seed banks. A. plicatilis seeds stored under ambient laboratory conditions for 3, 18 and 24 months were germinated in an environmental control chamber and a laboratory. High percentage germination was recorded for 18 - and 24 -month-seed (86 and 80 %, respectively), while germination of 3 -month-old seeds was three times lower, suggesting the need for after-ripening. Germination of fresh and one-year-old seed under ambient nursery conditions at the Karoo Desert National Botanical Garden in Worcester yielded emergence percentages of 67 and 44 %, respectively, and were therefore less successful than germination under more controlled conditions. This is the first known study to investigate the reproductive ecology of a tree aloe species and that of a Cape fynbos aloe. The study highlights the importance of further studies on aloe seed ecology, particularly for rare and threatened species...|$|R

40|$|A large {{diversity}} of floral morphological types exists within the bird pollination syndrome in the Cape Floral Region of South Africa. Here {{we focus on}} species with tubular flowers and ask: "Do differences in tube length among plant species correspond to differences in bill length among the birds that serve as pollinators?" To answer this question, we observed 1669 bird-plant interactions at thirteen bird-pollinated plant species across a spectrum of tube lengths. Only three nectar feeding bird species pollinated the focal plant species. The relatively short-billed species were the Southern Double-collared Sunbird (Cinnyris chalybea) and Orange-breasted Sunbird (Anthobaphes violacea); the only long-billed species was the <b>Malachite</b> <b>Sunbird</b> (Nectarinia famosa). We found that the groups of plant species pollinated by the long- and short-billed birds differed significantly in floral tube length. Short-billed sunbirds nevertheless often robbed long-tubed flowers by piercing the corolla, {{and there was a}} significant difference in floral tube length among those species that were robbed, and those that were pollinated by short-billed sunbirds. The presence of territorial Malachite Sunbirds depressed robbing rates by short-billed sunbirds at long-tubed flowers. In turn, the absence of Malachite Sunbirds from short-tubed plant species might be explained by the observed positive correlation between tube length and nectar volume. Together, these data suggest that there is a subset of the bird-pollinated plants at the Cape that are pollinated solely by the long-billed <b>Malachite</b> <b>Sunbird,</b> a pollination service irreplaceable by the more abundant, short-billed sunbird species. To extrapolate this finding to a greater subset of species in the Cape Floral Region, we measured flowers on herbarium specimens of all tubular putatively bird-pollinated plants. We find that floral tube length has a bimodal distribution with 37 Cape species potentially dependent on pollination by Malachite Sunbirds. © 2009 SAAB. Articl...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecent studies {{indicate}} that short-billed birds which visit flowers opportunistically for nectar are important pollinators of African plants and select for floral characteristics which are distinct from those found in sunbird-pollinated species. Here we report {{the existence of a}} pollination system involving opportunistic nectarivores in Kniphofia caulescens, a high altitude member of a genus previously considered to contain only sunbird- and insect-adapted pollination systems. Plants of K. caulescens set approximately twice as many fruits and produced more seeds per fruit when exposed to both bird and insect pollination than to just insect pollination. Controlled pollination experiments showed that the species is genetically self-incompatible and thus totally reliant on pollinator visits for seed set. Opportunistic nectar-feeding birds appear {{to be the most important}} pollinators of this plant. In particular, Drakensberg Siskins (Crithagra symonsi) and Yellow Canaries (Crithagra flaviventris) were the most frequent visitors and carried the highest pollen loads. The <b>Malachite</b> <b>Sunbird</b> (Nectarinia famosa), although often feeding on Kniphofia caulescens, carried very little pollen, presumably on account of its long bill which reduces contact between the floral anthers and its head feathers. Honey bees were also frequent flower visitors and made a secondary contribution to fruit set. Flowers of K. caulescens contained copious amounts (c. 30 µl) of very dilute (c. 9 %) hexose-rich nectar which is consistent with the pollination syndrome found in plants pollinated by opportunistic avian nectarivores...|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{manipulations}} of tail length {{have shown that}} the long tail of a male scarlet-tufted <b>malachite</b> <b>sunbird,</b> Nectarinia johnstoni, handicaps its ability to fly and its efficiency at catching aerial insects. Here the possible aerodynamic effects of increased tail length are examined. Two experimental groups of birds had their tails either lengthened or shortened; in one control group the tail was kept the same length but had feather splints added; and in another control group extra mass was added in the form of rings on the legs. Birds with shortened tails spent longer flying and hawked more efficiently than before the manipulation; birds with lengthened tails spent less time flying and were less efficient at hawking. Males with feather splints added also spent less time flying. Ringing had no effect on the birds' behaviour. These results correspond well with the predictions made if the influence of tail length mainpulation was primarily on the amount of drag produced by the tail and on the moment of inertia of the tail. These two effects mean that flight is more costly and manoeuvres become more difficult with increasing tail length. To compensate for the influence of the long tail the birds may increase their wingspan: the increase in span predicted from theory corresponds well with the relationship between tail length and wing length observed in the field. © 1992 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

40|$|The alpine zone of Mount Kenya is {{a typical}} equatorial, high-altitude habitat with a harsh environment, large {{fluctuations}} in physical conditions and an impoverished flora and fauna. A common flowering plant is Lobelia telekii, which has large inflorescences with up to 2000 flowers. The long hanging bracts of this plant ameliorate the physical environment around the flowers, damping the fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity. The scarlet-tufted <b>malachite</b> <b>sunbird</b> (Nectarinia johnstoni) is a highly active nectarivore that obtains most of its food from the nectar of L. telekii, Sunbirds {{are more likely to}} visit the younger, male flowers at the apex of the inflorescence, which are larger and contain twice as much sugar as the older, female flowers lower down the spike. Male flowers will gain from multiple visits by exporting more pollen, while female flowers probably need to be visited only a few times for successful fertilization. Male sunbirds were resident on their territories all year and vigorously defended them from conspecifics. All territories contained about four times the number of flowers visited by the territory occupants in a day. Males on territories with a large number of flowers suffered more intrusions than males on low quality territories and spent more time in flight. After an intrusion the resident male frequently fed near where the intrusion took place. Males that subsequently attracted mates defended about twice as many flowers as males that did not breed, although undefended inflorescences were present. Some males apparently defended territories suitable for a pair, others only for a single bird. © 1996 The Linnean Society of London. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
