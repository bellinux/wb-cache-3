40|$|International audienceOne of the {{criteria}} mastering {{the choice of a}} cutting tool is its wear resistance. For coated inserts, prior to the coating process, edge preparation method choice will impact their performance. So, a classification based on its impact on wear resistance is needed. Indeed, the flank wear of three coated cemented carbide inserts presenting differently prepared edges (untreated, dragging and magneto-abrasive machining) is explored experimentally. Those inserts are used to face mill the hardened AISI 4140 low alloy steel. Further, by means of the principal component analysis (PCA), correlations between the online measured cutting forces and flank wear behaviour are investigated. In view of this analysis, for each studied case, the statistical law predicting flank wear relying on cutting forces components is established with fair approximation.

In particular, nonlinear models have been devised for the assessment of the cardiovascular system by accounting for short-memory second-order nonlinearities. In this paper, we introduce a novel inverse Gaussian point process model with Laguerre expansion of the nonlinear Volterra kernels. Within the model, the second-order nonlinearities also account for the long-term information given by the past events of the nonstationary non-Gaussian time series. In addition, the mathematical link to an equivalent cubic input-output Wiener-Volterra model allows for a novel instantaneous estimation of the dynamic spectrum, bispectrum and trispectrum of the considered inter-event intervals. The proposed framework is tested with synthetic simulations and two experimental heartbeat interval datasets. Applications on further heterogeneous datasets such as <b>milling</b> <b>inserts,</b> neural spikes, gait from short walks, and geyser geologic events are also reported.

Titanium is deposited by FCVA while MoS 2 is magnetron sputtered. The deposition set up allows several compositions of Ti-MoS 2 to be deposited simultaneously, with Ti content ranging between 5 and 96 at. %, and their machining performances to be evaluated. Milling took place using a CNC Vertical Machining Center at a 877 mm/min feed rate. The effect of different coating compositional ratios {{on the degree of}} aluminium sticking when a <b>milling</b> <b>insert</b> is used to face mill an Al alloy (SAE 6061) was investigated using a combination of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis.

EDX mapping of the milling inserts after machining reveal that a Ti:MoS 2 ratio of around 0. 39 prevents Al from sticking to the tool edges. Since we prevent Al from sticking to the tool surface, the resultant machined surface finish is improved thus validating the machining performance of TiB 2 -coated tools using optimum compositions of Ti:MoS 2 thin film coatings...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to create a}} nite element model that simulates fatigue crack growth in coated {{cemented}} carbide <b>milling</b> <b>inserts.</b> A typical fatigue wear of coated milling tools are comb crack formation on the cutting edges of the tool inserts. Comb cracks initiate from pre-existent cooling cracks in the coating layers. Severe temperature changes occur during the intermittent machining and when using liquid coolant. As a result thermal stresses cause the initial cooling cracks to propagate. With the model this work also aim to model a possible explanation for lateral comb crack formation by introducing a material alteration zone. Chemical attack occurs when wet-milling as the cooling liquid enters the principal comb crack and reacts with the substrate. The presented model is based on WC{Co substrate with TiCN and Al 2 O 3 coatings. The model allow for a quick and comprehensive understanding of fatigue crack growth in milling tools due to simplied loading conditions, which include thermo-mechanical and mechanical stresses. Thermo-mechanical stresses are calculated corresponding to the temperature change during one milling cycle as well as stress contribution corresponding to residual stresses from the coating application process. The mechanical stresses are approximated and applied as pressures. The fatigue crack growth simulation is governed by Paris law and is performed using Extended Finite Element Method technique in ANSYS Mechanical APDL. The result of the simulations indicates that the residual stress state is more accurate using non-linear instead of linear material models, when comparing to experimentally measured stress states. The calculated fatigue cracks path were found to be similar in shape and length to that of a comb crack in early growth stage. The stress levels in the substrate are found to be compressive except for close to the crack tip where the stresses are tensile. The stress level in the proximity of the crack tip are several magnitudes larger than in the surroundings. The crack paths change in anglewere due to the applied mechanical pressure. The length of the crack is found to be inuenced by the thermo-mechanical stresses. The chemical attack zone model was introduced as a circular zone in the WC{Co layer.
