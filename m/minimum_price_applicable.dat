40|$|To control Medicaid's {{expenditure}} on prescription drugs, 1990 legislation {{established a}} rebate program guaranteeing Medicaid a rebate on each unit purchased by Medicaid participants. The rebate {{is the difference}} between the <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> and the average manufacturer <b>price</b> (<b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> rule) or a proportion of the average manufacturer price (average price rule). We characterize the optimal pricing strategy of a third-degree price discriminating monopolist under these rules. Under the <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> rule, the <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> gross of rebate always increases whereas prices gross of rebate in {{at least some of the}} markets always decrease. In contrast, under the average price rule, these prices may move in the same direction in all markets, with all increasing in some circumstances and all decreasing in others. We also examine the effects of such provisions on social welfare. We analyze a modified version of our <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> rule model suitable for applications beyond Medicaid. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "U. S. dairy farmers produced 167. 7 billion pounds of unprocessed, raw milk in 2000. Federal and state dairy programs influence the <b>minimum</b> <b>prices</b> paid to farmers for raw milk. These prices are based on how the raw milk is to be used. <b>Minimum</b> <b>prices</b> set for raw milk {{to be used for}} making drinking milk (fluid milk) are higher than those for milk used for manufacturing cheese, butter, and other dairy products. About 70 percent of the raw milk produced in the United States is regulated under the U. S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) federal milk marketing order program. The 1996 farm bill established another pricing program [...] the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact (NEDC) [...] which is run by a commission that sets a <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> for raw milk sold as fluid milk in six New England states. The NEDC works in conjunction with federal and state dairy programs to establish an alternative <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> for raw milk in the Compact states. When the monthly NEDC <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> exceeds the federal marketing order or state <b>minimum</b> <b>price,</b> the NEDC <b>price</b> becomes the <b>minimum</b> <b>price.</b> Congress is now considering legislation that would reauthorize and expand the NEDC and establish additional interstate dairy compacts.

40|$|THERE HAVE BEEN {{calls for}} Ireland {{to follow suit}} after Scotland pushed ahead with plans to {{introduce}} a <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> for alcohol. <b>Minimum</b> <b>pricing</b> – which sets a ‘floor’ beneath which alcohol cannot be sold – stops retailers from selling alcohol cheaply {{in a bid to}} prevent people from binge drinking. The Irish government has been debating whether to set a <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> on alcohol, with Minister for Health James Reilly saying he supports the introduction – but a number of government ministers have said they are concerned about the proposal. A judge ruled on Friday that plans by the Scottish government to set a <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> on alcohol is legal after a drinks industry body went to court to say that the government did not have the power to implement such a rule as it would interfere with trade. Scotland plans to set a <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> of alcohol at 50 p a unit (59 c). “The ruling is a significant one, not just for Scotland, but also for Ireland and the other EU countries which are seeking to introduce <b>minimum</b> <b>pricing</b> to tackle alcohol-related harm,” said Conor Cullen of Alcohol Action Ireland...|$|R

40|$|Position auctions {{such as the}} Generalized Second Price (GSP) are {{commonly}} used for sponsored search, e. g., by Yahoo! and Google. We now {{have an understanding of}} the equilibria of these auctions, via game-theoretic concepts like Generalized English Auctions and the “locally envy-free ” property, as well as through a relationship to the well-known, truthful Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism. In practice, however, position auctions are implemented with additional constraints, in particular, bidder-specific <b>minimum</b> <b>prices.</b> Such <b>minimum</b> <b>prices</b> are used to control the quality of the ads that appear on the page. We study the effect of bidder-specific <b>minimum</b> <b>prices</b> in position auctions. Naïvely enforcing <b>minimum</b> <b>prices</b> in the VCG mechanism breaks the truthfulness of the auction; we describe two variants of VCG for which revealing the truth is a dominant strategy. The implications of bidder-specific <b>minimum</b> <b>prices</b> are more intricate for the GSP auction. Some properties proved for standard GSP no longer hold in this setting. For example, we show that the GSP allocation is now not always efficient (in terms of advertiser value). Also, the property of“envy-locality”enjoyed by GSP—which is essential in the prior analysis of strategies and equilibria— no longer holds. Our main result is to show that despite losing envy locality, GSP with bidder-specific <b>minimum</b> <b>prices</b> still has an envy-free equilibrium. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the allocation problem of assigning heterogenous objects {{to a group}} of agents and determining how much they should pay. Each agent receives at most one object. Agents have non-quasi-linear preferences over bundles, each consisting of an object and a payment. Especially, we focus on the cases: (i) objects are linearly ranked, and as long as objects are equally priced, agents commonly prefer a higher ranked object to a lower ranked one, and (ii) objects are partitioned into several tiers, and as long as objects are equally priced, agents commonly prefer an object in the higher tier to an object in the lower tier. The <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> rule assigns a <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> (Walrasian) equilibrium to each preference profile. We establish: (i) on a common-object-ranking domain, the <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> rule is the only rule satisfying efficiency, strategy-proofness, individual rationality and no subsidy, and (ii) on a common-tiered-object domain, the <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> rule is the only rule satisfying these four axioms...|$|R
