The abovementioned effects, effects (i) and (ii), may be enhanced as the size of Si nanoparticles decreases. The great PL enhancement after DMA adsorption for the two-step milling method is most likely due to smaller Si nanoparticles with a higher concentration of active adsorption sites.|$|E

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{have been carried}} out to elucidate the role of surfactants on the primary marine aerosol production of submicron marine aerosols. A synthetic surfactant SDS was used in conjunction with artificially generated seawater, and the resultant bubble-mediated aerosol produced was observed. At 23 °C, the aerosol distribution resulting from the use of surfactant-free seawater comprised three modes: (1) a dominant accumulation mode at 110 nm; (2) an Aitken mode at 45 nm; and (3) a third mode, at 300 nm, resulting from forced bursting of bubbles. The forced bursting occurs when bubbles fail to burst upon reaching the surface and are later shattered by splashing associated with breaking waves and/or wind pressure at the surface. At 4 °C, the accumulation <b>mode</b> <b>diameter</b> was reduced to 85 nm, the Aitken <b>mode</b> <b>diameter</b> was reduced to < 30 nm and the 300 nm <b>mode</b> <b>diameter</b> was reduced to 200 nm. With the addition of SDS, the relative importance of the mode resulting from forced bursting increased dramatically. The laboratory results were compared to the observed seasonality of North Atlantic marine aerosol where a progression from mode radii minima in winter to maxima in summer is seen. The bimodality and the seasonality in modal diameter can be mostly explained by a combination of the three modes observed in the laboratory and their variation as a function of sea-surface temperature and seawater surfactant concentration. These results indicate that submicron primary aerosol modes would on a first approximation result from bubble bursting processes, although evidences of additional secondary processes leading, during summer, to a higher amplitude of the Aitken mode and mode 2 smoothed into mode 3 still need to be investigated.

40|$|Exposure {{to cooking}} fumes may be {{responsible}} for respiratory health effects. However, the linkage between such exposures and these effects cannot be established without knowing the size distribution of the aerosols emitted from cooking activities. This study examined the size distribution of the aerosols generated by commercial cooking processes. It was found that the aerosol size distributions were lognormal. Several theoretical models can explain the lognormal characteristic of aerosols from cooking processes and the simplest one is a bounded multiplicative process that represents the growth (or shrinkage) of aerosols in a random manner. Our results showed that by defining the <b>mode</b> <b>diameter</b> (geometric mean diameter) and the dimensionless geometric standard deviation one could describe the size distribution of cooking fumes in general. This characterization model can be applied to cooking fumes from indoor as well as outdoor cooking processes.

This study examines the number emission characteristics of 10 - 1000 nm nonvolatile particles from a heavy-duty diesel engine, operating with various waste cooking oil biodiesel blends (B 2, B 10 and B 20), engine loads (0 %, 25 %, 50 % and 75 %) and a diesel oxidation catalyst plus diesel particulate filter (DOC + DPF) under steady modes. For a given load, the total particle number concentrations (N-TOT) decrease slightly, while the <b>mode</b> <b>diameters</b> show negligible changes with increasing biodiesel blends. For a given biodiesel blend, both the N-TOT and <b>mode</b> <b>diameters</b> increase modestly with increasing load of above 25 %. The N-TOT at idle are highest and their size distributions are strongly affected by condensation and possible nucleation of semivolatile materials. Nonvolatile cores of diameters less than 16 nm are only observed at idle mode. The DOC + DPF shows remarkable filtration efficiency for both the core and soot particles, irrespective of the biodiesel blend and engine load under study. The N-TOT post the DOC + DPF are comparable to typical ambient levels of similar to 10 (4) cm(- 3). This implies that, without concurrent reductions of semivolatile materials, the formation of semivolatile nucleation mode particles post the aftertreatment is highly favored. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
