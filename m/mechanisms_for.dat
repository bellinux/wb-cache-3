Two additional CASS4 SNPs were reported {{to be associated with}} AD susceptibility: rs6024870, and rs16979934 T/G. Given the likely conserved CAS-family cytoskeletal function of CASS4, it has been speculated that it may have a role in axonal transport and influence the expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau, which are pathologically affected in AD. Several possible <b>mechanisms</b> <b>for</b> CASS4 action in AD have been proposed.|$|E
5|$|In {{many groups}} of crustaceans, the fertilised eggs are simply {{released}} into the water column, while others have developed a number of <b>mechanisms</b> <b>for</b> {{holding on to the}} eggs until they are ready to hatch. Most decapods carry the eggs attached to the pleopods, while peracarids, notostracans, anostracans, and many isopods form a brood pouch from the carapace and thoracic limbs. Female Branchiura do not carry eggs in external ovisacs but attach them in rows to rocks and other objects. Most leptostracans and krill carry the eggs between their thoracic limbs; some copepods carry their eggs in special thin-walled sacs, while others have them attached together in long, tangled strings.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} of micronuclei or where bubbles initially form is not known.

Homogeneous nucleation, where bubbles form within the liquid itself is less likely because it requires much greater pressure differences than experienced in decompression. The spontaneous formation of nanobubbles on hydrophobic surfaces is a possible source of micronuclei, but it is not yet clear if these can grow large enough to cause symptoms as they are very stable.|$|E

If a trans-Neptunian planet was responsible, all such objects would share roughly the same perihelion (about 80AU). If Sedna were captured from another planetary system that rotated {{in the same direction}} as the Solar System, then all of its population would have orbits on relatively low inclinations and have semi-major axes ranging from 100–500AU. If it rotated in the opposite direction, then two populations would form, one with low and one with high inclinations. The perturbations from passing stars would produce a wide variety of perihelia and inclinations, each dependent on the number and angle of such encounters.|$|E
5|$|The {{companion}} {{which is}} supposed to have spun-up PSR B1937+21 is no longer present, making it one of few millisecond pulsars which does not have a stellar mass companion. The generally high occurrence of companions to millisecond pulsars is to be expected, considering a companion is necessary to spin-up millisecond pulsars to their short periods. However, millisecond pulsars do not actively accrete matter from a companion, but instead need to have only done this at some time in the past, and thus the lack of companion for PSR B1937+21 is not seen as a being in disagreement with the spin-up model. Possible <b>mechanisms</b> <b>for</b> creating isolated millisecond pulsars include evaporation of the donor star or tidal disruption of the system.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Ernst Mayr {{was influenced}} by the work of the German biologist Bernhard Rensch showing the influence of local environmental factors on the geographic distribution of sub-species and closely related species. Mayr followed up on Dobzhansky's work with the 1942 book Systematics and the Origin of Species, which emphasized the importance of allopatric speciation in the formation of new species. This form of speciation occurs when the geographical isolation of a sub-population is followed by the development of <b>mechanisms</b> <b>for</b> reproductive isolation. Mayr also formulated the biological species concept that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations.|$|E
