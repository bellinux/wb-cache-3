50|$|In {{laboratory}} settings, {{hot plates}} are generally used to heat glassware or its contents. Some hot plates also contain a <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer,</b> allowing the heated liquid to be stirred automatically.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{multi-point}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> {{was developed}} and patented by Salvador Bonet of SBS Company in 1977. He also introduced the practice of noting the denomination of stirring power in [...] "liters of water", which is a market standard today.|$|E
5000|$|Under {{the above}} {{precautions}} the powder {{is to be}} mixed well into good quality anhydrous methanol in a proportion of 0.6g powder into 400 ml methanol. Using glass beads or a <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> or carefully warming to 37 degrees C may help in dissolving.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>{{magnetic}}</b> <b>stirrer</b> or magnetic mixer is {{a laboratory}} device that employs a {{rotating magnetic field}} to cause a stir bar (also called [...] "flea") immersed in a liquid to spin very quickly, thus stirring it. The rotating field may be created either by a rotating magnet or a set of stationary electromagnets, placed beneath the vessel with the liquid.|$|E
50|$|Retort stands {{are often}} used in the {{chemistry}} laboratory.For instance, it is used for carrying out distillation experiments which includes distillation of acids.It is also used in filtering.The sits are usually made of a chemically impervious metal and may be covered with aluminium foil to further protect the base, on which may sit a hot plate, <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer,</b> heating mantle, or some other apparatus.In titration experiments, {{it can be used}} to hold a burette.|$|E
5000|$|Arthur Rosinger of Newark, New Jersey, U.S.A. {{obtained}} US Patent 2,350,534, titled <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Stirrer</b> on 6 June 1944, having {{filed an}} application therefore on 5 October 1942. [...] Mr. Rosinger's patent includes {{a description of}} a coated bar magnet placed in a vessel, which is driven by a rotating magnet in a base below the vessel. Mr. Rosinger also explains in his patent that coating the magnet in plastic or covering it with glass or porcelain makes it chemically inert.|$|E
5000|$|A shaker is a {{piece of}} {{laboratory}} equipment used to mix, blend, or to agitate substances in tube(s) or flask(s) by shaking them, which is mainly used in the fields of chemistry and biology. A shaker contains an oscillating board which is used to place the flasks, beakers, test tubes, etc. Although the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> has come to replace the uses of shaker lately, the shaker is still a preferred choice of equipment when dealing with such large volume substances, or simultaneous agitation is required.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} BZ cocktails are {{available}} in the chemical literature and on the web. Ferroin, a complex of phenanthroline and iron, is a common indicator. These reactions, if carried out in petri dishes, result in the formation first of colored spots. These spots grow into a series of expanding concentric rings or perhaps expanding spirals similar to the patterns generated by a cyclic cellular automaton. The colors disappear if the dishes are shaken, and then reappear. The waves continue until the reagents are consumed. The reaction can also be performed in a beaker using a <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{apparatus}} is assembled {{as in the}} diagram. (The diagram {{represents a}} batch apparatus {{as opposed to a}} continuous apparatus.) The mixture is put into the round bottomed flask along with a few anti-bumping granules (or a Teflon coated <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> bar if using magnetic stirring), and the fractionating column is fitted into the top. The fractional distillation column is set up with the heat source at the bottom on the still pot. As the distance from the stillpot increases, a temperature gradient is formed in the column; it is coolest at the top and hottest at the bottom. As the mixed vapor ascends the temperature gradient, some of the vapor condenses and revaporizes along the temperature gradient. Each time the vapor condenses and vaporizes, the composition of the more volatile component in the vapor increases. This distills the vapor {{along the length of the}} column, and eventually the vapor is composed solely of the more volatile component (or an azeotrope). The vapor condenses on the glass platforms, known as trays, inside the column, and runs back down into the liquid below, refluxing distillate. The efficiency in terms of the amount of heating and time required to get fractionation can be improved by insulating the outside of the column in an insulator such as wool, aluminium foil or preferably a vacuum jacket. The hottest tray is at the bottom and the coolest is at the top. At steady state conditions, the vapor and liquid on each tray are at equilibrium. The most volatile component of the mixture exits as a gas at the top of the column. The vapor at the top of the column then passes into the condenser, which cools it down until it liquefies. The separation is more pure with the addition of more trays (to a practical limitation of heat, flow, etc.) Initially, the condensate will be close to the azeotropic composition, but when much of the ethanol has been drawn off, the condensate becomes gradually richer in water. The process continues until all the ethanol boils out of the mixture. This point can be recognized by the sharp rise in temperature shown on the thermometer.|$|E

40|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> bar {{is widely}} used in bio-chemical field for mixing of cell cultures. Increases in {{rotation}} speed often caused the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> bar to be spinoff from its position and leads to death of the cell cultures. Design of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> bar accessory, three point arms is {{the main focus of}} the research. The attachment of this additional accessory has eliminated the spin-off effect. The hydrodynamic behavior of this design has been simulated using GAMBIT and FLUENT simulation software.

40|$|In this paper, a novel focused time lagged {{recurrent}} {{neural network}} (FTLR NN) with gamma memory filter {{is designed to}} learn the subtle complex dynamics of a typical <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> process. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> exhibits complex nonlinear operations where reaction is exothermic. It appears to us that identification of such a highly nonlinear system is not yet reported by other researchers using neural networks. As <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> process includes time relationship in the input-output mappings, time lagged recurrent neural network is particularly used for identification purpose. The standard back propagation algorithm with momentum term has been proposed in this model. The various parameters like number of processing elements, number of hidden layers, training and testing percentage, learning rule and transfer function in hidden and output layer are investigated {{on the basis of}} performance measures like MSE, NMSE and correlation coefficient on testing data set.

40|$|For {{the first}} time a cyclone {{evaporator}} has been designed and tested with perfectly wetting liquids in two separate experiments on condensation, at variable gravity conditions during parabolic flights. Two liquids (FC- 72 and HFE- 7100), with surface tension coefficient of 12 - 15 mN/m, were used in the experiments. The concept of the liquid retention by the centrifugal force and the specific design of the walls were validated in the first series of experiments in isothermal conditions. The liquid behaviour inside the experimental cell in weightlessness is reported and discussed for the variable liquid volume (100 - 200 ml) inside the cell and the rotating velocity of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> inside the evaporator (0 - 900 rpm). The data obtained during the isothermal case were used to improve the design of the evaporation cell for the non-isothermal case, tested during a second parabolic flight campaign. In this second experiment, both the power (1. 8 - 16 W) and rotational velocity of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> (0 - 250 rpm) were varied. For a fluid charge of 100 ml the same fluid never left the evaporator in all tests performed with rotation of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer.</b> The vapour pressure in the cell increased during microgravity period. It was found that the stabilization of vapour pressure after transition to microgravity decreases with an increase in the rotational speed of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer.</b> We conclude that the cyclone evaporator is also an ideal candidate for those systems that have to work in microgravity and rely on pool boiling, because the cyclone chops large bubbles that would otherwise occupy the whole evaporator space and reduce the heat-transfer rate.

30|$|In summary, highly monodispersed spherical GNPs were {{produced}} by the sodium citrate reduction method using a conventional ultrasonic bath without an additional heater or <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer.</b> It {{was found that the}} sonication energy has a significant effect on the particle size and morphology of GNPs for a fixed ultrasonic power and frequency. Thus, this study shows the importance of ultrasonic energy in the ultrasonic-induced production of water-soluble GNPs of tunable sizes (20 to 50 [*]nm) by citrate reduction. A hypothetical scheme for understanding the role of ultrasonic energy on the size of water-soluble GNPs was discussed. The single-step method using a conventional ultrasonic bath developed in this study offers new opportunities to synthesise aqueous suspensions of monodispersed spherical GNPs without a <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{polymeric}} electrospinning solutions {{with various}} cellulose contents of 0.63, 0.9, 1, 1.25, and 1.5  % w/w were prepared using ionized water.

The Pyrex beaker is dipped into a big water container, thermically insulated, which has achieved room temperature. This container was installed on top of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> (Decalab S.R.L.; 2000  rpm; 280  °C) and the stirrer. Throughout the determination the system is kept stirred. Besides, inside the Pyrex beaker, the bench conductivity meter is added. That conductivity meter is a Eutech Instrument Pte. Ltd/Oakton Instrument CON 510. The meter was packaged with a two ring stainless steel Ultem-Body Conductivity/TDS electrode, which cell constant K =  1.0, with built in temperature sensor for automatic temperature compensation and an integral electrode holder. When the room temperature is reached in the Pyrex beaker, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stirrer</b> is switched on and the amount of titrant needed to exchange all the counter ions of the membrane is added.
