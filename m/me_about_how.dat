500|$|Peirce {{initially}} {{wanted to}} shoot in Falls City, but Vachon {{told her that}} filming {{there would not be}} possible. Afterwards, the film was going to be shot in Omaha, Nebraska, but Peirce felt that [...] "none of [...] looked right." [...] In addition, Peirce also scouted filming locations in Kansas and Florida before deciding on Texas. [...] One of Peirce's main goals was for the audience to sympathize with Brandon. On the film's DVD commentary track, Peirce said, [...] "The work was informing <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> I wanted to represent it. I wanted the audience to enter deeply into this place, this character, so they could entertain these contradictions in Brandon's own mind and would not think he was crazy, would not think he was lying, but would see him as more deeply human".|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} June 1956, {{his song}} [...] "Roll Over Beethoven" [...] reached number 29 on the Billboards Top 100 chart, and Berry toured {{as one of the}} [...] "Top Acts of '56". He and Carl Perkins became friends. Perkins said that [...] "I knew when I first heard Chuck that he'd been {{affected}} by country music. I respected his writing; his records were very, very great." [...] As they toured, Perkins discovered that Berry not only liked country music but also knew about as many songs as he did. Jimmie Rodgers was one of his favorites. [...] "Chuck knew every Blue Yodel and most of Bill Monroe's songs as well", Perkins remembered. [...] "He told <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> he was raised very poor, very tough. He had a hard life. He was a good guy. I really liked him." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2012, Hawke {{entered the}} horror genre {{for the first}} time, by playing a true crime writer in Scott Derrickson's Sinister, which grossed US$87million at the {{worldwide}} box office—the film {{was the first in}} a series of highly profitable films for Hawke after the start of the new decade. In the week prior to the US opening of Sinister, Hawke explained that he was previously turned off by horror because good acting is not always required for success; however, the producer of Sinister, Jason Blum, who formerly ran a theater company with Hawke, made the offer to the actor based on the character and director."when I was younger, I ran a theater company with this guy, Jason Blum. And he loved horror movies and he went on to create his own little subgenre with [...] "Paranormal Activity." [...] And he kept trying to talk to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> I should love this whole genre. And I told him: I've never had a script with a really great character and a real filmmaker attached to it that I'd be interested in. So, he brought me into it.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the strikes}} were {{extremely}} effective in paralyzing Moldovan industry, {{there were many}} instances were individuals and groups happy with the language legislation managed to win the day and keep their factories open. Moreover, some workers organized anti-strike committees {{to fight against the}} activities of the OSTK. Supreme Soviet Deputy from Tiraspol and firm supporter of the language laws, Leonida Dicusar, talked in September about the extreme pressure experienced by those brave few who worked to keep the factories open in the face of overwhelming odds. [...] "I had a meeting with representatives of the anti-strike committee of one enterprise," [...] she told fellow central committee members. [...] "They told <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> they heroically withstood pressure, blackmail, belittling, and insults during the strike from the Russophone population." [...] Elsewhere, the OSTK even had to give in to resistance. On 26 August the director of a textiles factory in Rȋbniţa told the city strike committee that the factory committee was not in control of the situation. [...] "Between the workers there had been fights and scandals. A part of the weavers, about 1000 people, want to return to work and the rest were against them." [...] In light of the potentially explosive situation, the factory director asked the factory and city strike committees to consider reopening. In this case the city strike committee conceded. Far more common, however, national revivalist individuals were isolated and vulnerable. Ilie Ilaşcu, famous for having a Transnistrian court sentence him to death in 1992 for terrorism on behalf of the Moldovan state, is one such example. As head economist of one Tiraspol factory, he was derided as [...] "head extremist" [...] by coworkers before he was fired. His employer reinstated Ilaşcu after he protested with the city prosecutor, but he continued to clash with coworkers and local authorities as the city's branch chairman of the Popular Front of Moldova.|$|E

5000|$|After {{his success}} on Kickstarter for {{raising money for}} a Veronica Mars movie in March 2013, Veronica Mars creator Rob Thomas said that Bryan Fuller {{approached}} him to [...] "talk to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> this thing works" [...] in relation to continuing Pushing Daisies. Fuller later commented that a Kickstarter campaign would be harder for Pushing Daisies due to the budget differences. He said that $12-15 million would be required.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the corner}} of Block 12, there used to an old {{provision}} shop opened by an elderly couple for over 50 years, before it was sold in late 2013. The shop was easily recognizable by its old signboard, which the uncle revealed that it was made by themselves. There was also the smell of butter and dried goods coming from the provision shop, with tins of biscuits lining the walls. Chanel Hu recalled, “I remember dropping the shop when I was younger. Mr Lim was always kind, courteous and giving, offering me a handful of local biscuits every time I visited.

[...] When asked what inspired the song's lyrics, he continued, [...] "My team and I reached out to Lo to see if she'd be interested in a collaboration, and a couple months later, we began writing the lyrics that would go over these instrumentals.
