40|$|Methane {{production}} and transport processes in peatlands are fairly well understood, but growing evidence for <b>emission</b> of <b>methane</b> through trees has highlighted {{the need to}} revisit methane transport processes. In wetland trees, morphological adaptations such as development of hypertrophied lenticels, aerenchyma and adventitious roots in response to soil anoxia mediates gas transport, transporting both oxygen from the atmosphere to oxygen-deprived roots and soil-produced methane from the root-zone to the atmosphere. Although, tree-mediated <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from temperate tree species have been confirmed, <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from tropical tree species and processes that control tree-mediated <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> remain unclear. This study explains the role of trees in transporting soil-produced methane to the atmosphere and uncovers the principal mechanisms of tree-mediated <b>methane</b> <b>emissions.</b> <b>Methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from eight tropical tree species and two temperate tree species were studied in situ. The mechanisms and controls on tree-mediated <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> were investigated using three year old common alder (Alnus glutinosa; 50 trees) grown under two artificially controlled water-table positions. Methane fluxes from whole mesocosms, the soil surface and tree stems were measured using static closed chambers. Both temperate and tropical tree species released significant quantities of methane, with tropical trees dominating ecosystem level methane fluxes. In temperate peatlands, both the methane gas transport mechanism and quantity of methane emitted from stems is tree-species dependent. In Alnus glutinosa, no correlations were observed between stomatal behaviour and tree-mediated <b>methane</b> <b>emissions,</b> however, stem <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> were positively correlated with both stem lenticel density and dissolved soil methane concentration. In Alnus glutinosa, no emissions were observed from leaf surfaces.

40|$|The {{prediction}} of <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from high-latitude wetlands is important given concerns about their sensitivity to a warming climate. As {{a basis for}} the {{prediction of}} wetland <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> at regional scales, we coupled the variable infiltration capacity macroscale hydrological model (VIC) with the biosphere–energy-transfer–hydrology terrestrial ecosystem model (BETHY) and a wetland <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> model to make large-scale estimates of <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> as a function of soil temperature, water table depth, and net primary productivity (NPP), with a parameterization of the sub-grid heterogeneity of the water table depth based on TOPMODEL. We simulated the <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from a 100 km × 100 km region of western Siberia surrounding the Bakchar Bog, for a retrospective baseline period of 1980 – 1999 and have evaluated their sensitivity to increases in temperature of 0 – 5 °C and increases in precipitation of 0 – 15 %. The interactions of temperature and precipitation, through their effects on the water table depth, {{played an important role in}} determining <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from these wetlands. The balance between these effects varied spatially, and their net effect depended in part on sub-grid topographic heterogeneity. Higher temperatures alone increased methane production in saturated areas, but caused those saturated areas to shrink in extent, resulting in a net reduction in <b>methane</b> <b>emissions.</b> Higher precipitation alone raised water tables and expanded the saturated area, resulting in a net increase in <b>methane</b> <b>emissions.</b> Combining a temperature increase of 3 °C and an increase of 10 % in precipitation to represent climate conditions that may pertain in western Siberia at the end of this century resulted in roughly a doubling in annual emissions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Livestock play an {{important}} role in carbon cycling through consumption of biomass and <b>emissions</b> of <b>methane.</b> Recent research suggests that existing bottom-up inventories of livestock <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> in the US, such as those made using 2006 IPCC Tier 1 livestock emissions factors, are too low. This may be due to outdated information used to develop these emissions factors. In this study, we update information for cattle and swine by region, based on reported recent changes in animal body mass, feed quality and quantity, milk productivity, and management of animals and manure. We then use this updated information to calculate new livestock <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> factors for enteric fermentation in cattle, and for manure management in cattle and swine. Results Using the new emissions factors, we estimate global livestock emissions of 119. 1  ±  18. 2  Tg methane in 2011; this quantity is 11 % greater than that obtained using the IPCC 2006 emissions factors, encompassing an 8. 4 % increase in enteric fermentation methane, a 36. 7 % increase in manure management methane, and notable variability among regions and sources. For example, revised manure management <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> for 2011 in the US increased by 71. 8 %. For years through 2013, we present (a) annual livestock <b>methane</b> <b>emissions,</b> (b) complete annual livestock carbon budgets, including carbon dioxide emissions, and (c) spatial distributions of livestock methane and other carbon fluxes, downscaled to 0. 05  ×  0. 05 degree resolution. Conclusions Our revised bottom-up estimates of global livestock <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> are comparable to recently reported top-down global estimates for recent years, and account for a significant part of the increase in annual <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> since 2007. Our results suggest that livestock <b>methane</b> <b>emissions,</b> while not the dominant overall source of global <b>methane</b> <b>emissions,</b> may be a major contributor to the observed annual emissions increases over the 2000 s to 2010 s. Differences at regional and local scales may help distinguish livestock <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from those of other sectors in future top-down studies. The revised estimates allow improved reconciliation of top-down and bottom-up estimates of <b>methane</b> <b>emissions,</b> will facilitate the development and evaluation of Earth system models, and provide consistent regional and global Tier 1 estimates for environmental assessments...|$|R

Here we optimized <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from north of 60 ° N (pan-Arctic) regions using a nested-grid high-resolution inverse model that assimilates both high-precision surface measurements and column-average SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartogrphY (SCIAMACHY) satellite retrievals of methane mole fraction. For the first time, <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from lakes were integrated into an atmospheric transport and inversion estimate, together with prior wetland emissions estimated with six biogeochemical models. In our estimates, in 2005, global <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> were {{in the range of}} 496. 4 – 511. 5  Tg yr − 1, and pan-Arctic <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> were in the range of 11. 9 – 28. 5  Tg yr − 1. <b>Methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from pan-Arctic wetlands and lakes were 5. 5 – 14. 2 and 2. 4 – 14. 2  Tg yr − 1, respectively. <b>Methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from Siberian wetlands and lakes are the largest and also have the largest uncertainty. Our results indicate that the uncertainty introduced by different wetland models could be much larger than the uncertainty of each inversion. We also show that assimilating satellite retrievals can reduce the uncertainty of the nested-grid inversions. The significance of lake emissions cannot be identified across the pan-Arctic by high-resolution inversions, but it is possible to identify high lake emissions from some specific regions.

Because each type of wetland is unique, the same characteristics used to classify each wetland {{can also be used to}} characterize the amount of methane emitted from that particular wetland. Any waterlogged environment with moderate levels of decomposition create the anaerobic conditions needed for methanogenesis, but the amount of water and decomposition will affect the magnitude of methane emissions in a specific environment. For example, lower water tables result in lower levels of <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> because methanotrophic bacteria require oxic conditions to oxidize methane into carbon dioxide and water.
