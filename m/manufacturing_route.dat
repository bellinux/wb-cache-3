40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a methodology to generate <b>manufacturing</b> <b>routes</b> and operations using {{rules of precedence}} to provide logical approach in their dimensioning and chaining. The rules of precedence order and prioritize the knowledge of various manufacturing processes, {{taking into account the}} theories of machining, forging, assembly, and heat treatments; also, utilizes the theories of accumulation of tolerance and process capability, between others. The proposed methodology requires development of manufacturing data bases of manufacturing process, tolerances and capabilities, deviations of the machine tool – cutting tool – fixture device and work piece. The rules of precedence make viable the generation of manufacturing routings and operations, through the usage of structured knowledge, instead of tacit one. This approach allows the structured development of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>routes,</b> which can be deployed to engineers working in the areas of manufacturing engineering...|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of inserting a thread through a layered dry fabric, using a needle that, after insertion, moves {{back along the}} same trajectory leaving a loop of the thread {{on the bottom of}} the structure. It is a technology developed for and used within the thermoset resin injection <b>manufacturing</b> <b>route,</b> however it is currently being debated whether also pre-pregs can be successfully tufted. Tufting is considered a more economical and flexible method compared to 3D weaving or 3D braiding to include z-fibres in laminated composites. It resembles stitching, but it is different in that tufting only requires access from one side of the preform. Depending on the equipment used, all shapes and forms may potentially be reinforced by tufting. The density of z-fibres inserted can vary according to the expected loading pattern. On the other hand, the increase of z-properties in the dry preform is comparably low because tufting comprises no force-fit. Consequently, before consolidation, tufted preforms are not easier to handle than unreinforced ones. In fact the loops can represent an added complexity for the resin infusion process as they can complicate the consolidation of the structure.|$|E

Preferrentially, these parts {{are produced by}} powdermetallurgical means using suitable spacer materials. Porosities up to 75 % and well defined pore sizes {{in the range of}} 0. 1 to 2. 0 mm. are achieved adjusting the amount and the particle size of the spacer material. Up to now, near-net-shape manufacturing of highly porous parts was hindered by the plastic deformation of the sintered network during machining leading to a partial or complete closing of the open porosity.

40|$|Innovation opens new {{opportunities}} {{in the field of}} processing hollow semi-products, as it offers the potential for manufacturing complex-shaped structural parts with enhanced properties. This introduces a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>route</b> comprising the following steps: internal high pressure forming, hot stamping and thermomechanical Q&P processing. In this <b>manufacturing</b> <b>route,</b> the demonstration product, a tube–shaped stock, is first austenitized. It is then expanded in a closed die by internal pressure of nitrogen until the material touches the die wall. As a result, it cools down quickly and martensite begins to form. At a temperature above the Mf, the cooling is interrupted and the workpiece is transferred to a furnace and tempered. The furnace temperature is below the Ms temperature. Within several minutes, a mixed microstructure forms, consisting of martensite and stabilized retained austenite. Thanks to this microstructure, the material exhibits a favourable combination of high strength and adequate ductility. Martensite imparts sufficient strength to the material whereas the retained austenite provides ductility.

The introduction of plastic deformation into a friction stir weld {{is a unique}} feature of the proposed <b>manufacturing</b> <b>route.</b> This investigation addressed abnormal grain growth [AGG] within the friction stir weldments during postfabrication processing of a prototype dome. The phenomenon of AGG was observed during the solution heat treatment [SHT] phase of T 8 tempering and {{is a major concern}} for meeting specifications. Such abrupt microstructural transitions can be detrimental to notch-sensitive mechanical properties, such as ductility and/or fracture toughness. If the issue of AGG cannot be resolved, then the acceptance of this approach as a viable <b>manufacturing</b> <b>route</b> may be in jeopardy. The innovative approach adopted in this investigation was the insertion of a stand-alone, Intermediate Annealing Treatment [IAT] between the spin forming and T 8 processing operations. A simple, recovery annealing step was deemed to be the most readily-scalable solution when fabricating thin-walled, ellipsoidal domes. The research effort culminated in the development of an effective IAT, which resulted in a significant decrease in AGG following SHT. The processing philosophy adopted in designing the IAT is outlined and the microstructural reasons for success are discussed. The analytical results presented are consistent with promoting continuous grain growth during the IAT, thereby suppressing AGG during the SHT...|$|E
