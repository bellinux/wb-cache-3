5|$|Since the {{hourglass}} {{was one of}} the few reliable {{methods of}} <b>measuring</b> <b>time</b> at sea, it is speculated that it was used on board ships as far back as the 11th century, when it would have complemented the magnetic compass as an aid to navigation. However, the earliest unambiguous evidence of their use appears in the painting Allegory of Good Government, by Ambrogio Lorenzetti, from 1338. From the 15th century onwards, hourglasses were used in a wide range of applications at sea, in churches, in industry, and in cooking; they were the first dependable, reusable, reasonably accurate, and easily constructed time-measurement devices. The hourglass also took on symbolic meanings, such as that of death, temperance, opportunity, and Father Time, usually represented as a bearded, old man. Though also used in China, the hourglass's history there is unknown. The Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan used 18 hourglasses on each ship during his circumnavigation of the globe in 1522.|$|E
5|$|The 365-day haab was {{produced}} by a cycle of eighteen named 20-day winals, completed {{by the addition of}} 5-day period called the wayeb. The wayeb was considered to be a dangerous time, when the barriers between the mortal and supernatural realms were broken, allowing malignant deities to cross over and interfere in human concerns. In a similar way to the tz'olkin, the named winal would be prefixed by a number (from 0 to 19), {{in the case of the}} shorter wayeb period, the prefix numbers ran 0 to 4. Since each day in the tz'olkin had a name and number (e.g. 8 Ajaw), this would interlock with the haab, producing an additional number and name, to give any day a more complete designation, for example 8 Ajaw 13 Keh. Such a day name could only recur once every 52 years, and this period is referred to by Mayanists as the Calendar Round. In most Mesoamerican cultures, the Calendar Round was the largest unit for <b>measuring</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{leakage current}} value {{depends on the}} voltage applied, on the {{temperature}} of the capacitor, and on <b>measuring</b> <b>time.</b> Leakage current in solid MnO2 tantalum electrolytic capacitors generally drops very much faster than for non-solid electrolytic capacitors but remain at the level reached.|$|E
25|$|Closed mode systems, by definition, {{are closed}} without a vent. When making {{measurement}}s, closed systems take a CO2 measurement of ambient air {{just after the}} soil sample chamber is sealed. This becomes the CO2 reference. The system continues to take measurements at regular intervals {{over the next few}} minutes until a final CO2 concentration is recorded at a predetermined end time over time. Closed systems have the advantages that they are used by more researchers, and they provide wind proof results. Since there is no vent, wind is not an issue. When using a closed mode system, {{it is important that the}} experimental design include a maximum <b>measuring</b> <b>time</b> for two reasons: First; if the <b>measuring</b> <b>time</b> is too long, an unacceptable positive partial CO2 pressure can build up in the chamber limiting the amount of additional CO2 from entering the chamber, causing a measuring artifact. The second reason is that if a chamber that is closed for too long, it can modify ambient conditions and cause measuring artifacts. Finding the optimal <b>measuring</b> <b>time</b> range is important. Tests on the soil in question can confirm the best time solution, and eliminate the partial CO2 pressure buildup from being a significant issue.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of equivalences for timed systems. Two systems are {{equivalent}} iff external observers cannot observe differences in their behavior. The notion of equivalence depends, therefore, on the distinguishing power of the observers. The power of an observer to <b>measure</b> <b>time</b> results in untimed, clock, and timed equivalences: an untimed observer cannot <b>measure</b> the <b>time</b> difference between events; a clock observer uses a clock to <b>measure</b> <b>time</b> differences with finite precision; a timed observer is able to <b>measure</b> <b>time</b> differences with arbitrary precision. We show that the distinguishing power of clock observers grows {{with the number of}} observers, and approaches, in the limit, the distinguishing power of a timed observer. More precisely, given any equivalence for untimed systems, two timed systems are k-clock congruent, for a nonnegative integer k, iff their compositions with every environment that uses k clocks are untimed equivalent. Both k-clock bisimulation congruence and k-cloc [...] ...|$|R

25|$|After a <b>measuring</b> <b>time</b> of 2 or 5 minutes, {{depending}} on the data sheet specification, the measured leakage current value has to be lower than the calculated value. Normally the leakage current is always lower the longer the capacitor voltage is applied. The leakage current during operation after, for example, one hour is the operational leakage current. This value depends strongly on the manufacturer's series characteristics. It could be lower than 1/100 of the specified value.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the model}} must be time {{reversible}} and must approach the equilibrium nucleotide (base) frequencies at long times, each rate below the diagonal equals the reciprocal rate above the diagonal {{multiplied by the}} equilibrium ratio of the two bases. As such, the nucleotide GTR requires 6 substitution rate parameters and 4 equilibrium base frequency parameters. Since the 4 frequency parameters must sum to 1, there are only 3 free frequency parameters. The total of 9 free parameters is often further reduced to 8 parameters plus , {{the overall number of}} substitutions per unit time. When <b>measuring</b> <b>time</b> in substitutions (=1) only 8 free parameters remain.|$|E

25|$|The {{leakage current}} {{includes}} all weak imperfections of the dielectric caused by unwanted chemical processes and mechanical damage {{and is the}} DC current that can pass through the dielectric after applying a voltage in correct polarity. It depends on the capacitance value, on applied voltage and temperature of the capacitor, on <b>measuring</b> <b>time,</b> {{on the kind of}} electrolyte, and on preconditions like previous storage time without voltage applied or thermic stress from soldering. (All non-solid electrolytic capacitors needs a recovery time of some hours after soldering before measuring the leakage current. Non-solid chip capacitors need a recovery time after reflow soldering of about 24 hours.) Leakage current is reduced by applying operational voltage by self-healing processes.|$|E
500|$|Paris and Blois {{were the}} early centers of clockmaking in France. French clockmakers such as Julien Le Roy, clockmaker of Versailles, were leaders in case design and {{ornamental}} clocks. Le Roy {{belonged to the}} fifth generation {{of a family of}} clockmakers, and was described by his contemporaries as [...] "the most skillful clockmaker in France, possibly in Europe". He invented a special repeating mechanism which improved the precision of clocks and watches, a face that could be opened to view the inside clockwork, and made or supervised over 3,500watches.
