5|$|A bromine {{extraction}} {{plant was}} opened in Amlwch in 1953 by Associated Ethyl (soon renamed Associated Octel, and later {{part of the}} Great Lakes Chemical Corporation). Chlorine produced at a plant in Ellesmere Port was brought by rail to Amlwch, which was used to extract bromine from sea water. The resulting ethylene dibromide was taken from Amlwch by rail as well. The company built a light railway through the town to Amlwch station, and a <b>marshalling</b> yard for exchanging freight wagons.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Whittle's son, Ivan Ernest, {{served as}} a private in the 2/33rd Australian Infantry Battalion. He was killed when the B-24 Liberator {{aircraft}} he was travelling in crashed into a <b>marshalling</b> yard at Port Moresby, New Guinea, on 7 September 1943. At his home in Glebe on 2 March 1946, John Whittle died of a cerebral haemorrhage {{at the age of}} 63. Survived by his wife, a son and three daughters, he was buried in Rookwood Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Schnaufer was {{appointed}} Gruppenkommandeur IV./NJG1 on 1 March 1944, taking over {{command of the}} Gruppe from Jabs who was given command of NJG1. He was promoted to Hauptmann on 1 May 1944. Schnaufer became an ace-in-a-day {{for the first time}} on 25 May 1944 when he claimed five RAF bombers shot down between 01:15 and 01:29 for victories 70 to 74. The bombers had targeted the railway <b>marshalling</b> yard at Aachen.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} air {{activity}} over German-held territory. RAF Bomber Command flew 92 sorties against German invasion targets at Boulogne, Calais, Ostend, Dunkirk, and Antwerp. The remaining sorties were directed at Brussels <b>marshalling</b> yards, Hamm and Krefeld. One Armstrong Whitworth Whitley failed to return. It {{was lost to}} ground fire over the Netherlands. A total of 157 sorties were flown overall. By the September 1940, some 10–13% of invasion barges had been sunk.|$|E
5|$|From 1913 former S {{lines were}} {{electrified}} with 1,500Vdc overhead lines and electric locomotives hauled coal trains between Shildon and Erimus <b>marshalling</b> yard, which had opened in 1908 between Middlesbrough and Thornaby. The trains took the former S line from Shildon to Simpasture Junction, joining the former Clarence Railway line to Carlton, where a later line allowed {{access to the}} Stockton to Middlesbrough extension. The locomotives operated for 20 years, but then coal traffic had reduced, which made it uneconomical to maintain the electrification system.|$|E
50|$|The rank of air chief <b>marshal</b> is {{immediately}} senior {{to the rank}} of air <b>marshal</b> but subordinate to <b>marshal</b> of the air force. Air chief <b>marshals</b> are sometimes generically considered to be air <b>marshals.</b>|$|R
50|$|In January 1943 {{the ranks}} of <b>marshal</b> of the air force, <b>marshal</b> of the {{artillery}} and <b>marshal</b> of the armoured corps came into existence. In October 1943 {{it was followed by}} the additional ranks <b>marshal</b> of the communication troops, and <b>marshal</b> of the engineer troops, and the equivalent chief <b>marshal</b> of the branch ranks were added.|$|R
50|$|When {{the rank}} of chief <b>marshal</b> of the branch was established, {{the size of the}} {{shoulder}} board stars for <b>marshals</b> was made about 10mm smaller, indicating the superiority of the <b>marshal</b> of the Soviet Union. The first level <b>marshal's</b> star was worn on the uniform tie of chief <b>marshals</b> of the branch and <b>marshals</b> of the Soviet Union.|$|R
5|$|In May 1941, Edwards became {{commanding}} officer of No. 105 Squadron replacing the previous incumbent, {{who had been killed}} in an anti-shipping raid on Stavanger. At that time, the Squadron was engaged in a series of daylight operations against Germany and the occupied countries, with its principal targets being enemy shipping, power installations, shipbuilding yards, locomotives, steelworks and <b>marshalling</b> yards. On 15 June, by now an acting wing commander, Edwards led six Blenheims on a search for enemy shipping and soon sighted a convoy of eight merchantmen anchored near The Hague. He launched an attack at low level, his bombs striking a 4,000 ton ship. He was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for this action.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of NATO brought about some standardization of allied military terminology, procedures, and technology, which {{in many cases}} meant European countries adopting US practices. The roughly 1300Standardization Agreements (STANAG) codified many of the common practices that NATO has achieved. Hence, the 7.62×51mm NATO rifle cartridge {{was introduced in the}} 1950s as a standard firearm cartridge among many NATO countries. Fabrique Nationale de Herstal's FAL, which used the 7.62mm NATO cartridge, was adopted by 75 countries, including many outside of NATO. Also, aircraft <b>marshalling</b> signals were standardized, so that any NATO aircraft could land at any NATO base. Other standards such as the NATO phonetic alphabet have made their way beyond NATO into civilian use.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{planners}} considered tactical {{surprise to}} be a necessary {{element of the}} plan for the landings. Information on the exact date and location of the landings was provided only to the topmost levels of the armed forces. Men were sealed into their <b>marshalling</b> areas {{at the end of}} May, with no further communication with the outside world. Troops were briefed using maps that were correct in every detail except for the place names, and most were not told their actual destination until they were already at sea. A news blackout in Britain increased the effectiveness of the deception operations. Travel to and from the Republic of Ireland was banned, and movement within several kilometres of the coast of England restricted.|$|E
50|$|Also, in 1992 {{eight other}} generals were {{promoted}} to vice <b>marshal</b> {{at which time}} in North Korea there was one grand <b>marshal,</b> one <b>marshal</b> of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, one <b>marshal</b> of the Korean People's Army and eight vice <b>marshals.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Marshal: Supervises a {{specific}} combat-related activity, insuring safety of participants and refereeing where applicable. A <b>marshal</b> must be certified {{for the type}} of activity they oversee; as such there are armored combat <b>marshals,</b> rapier <b>marshals,</b> target archery <b>marshals,</b> equestrian <b>marshals,</b> etc. A <b>marshal</b> of a given certification must be present for that particular activity to take place at an event.|$|R
5|$|In response, the United Nations {{began to}} pass a series of resolutions {{demanding}} the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Afraid that Saudi Arabia would be invaded next, the Saudi government requested immediate military aid. As a result, the United States began <b>marshalling</b> forces {{from a variety of}} nations, styled the Coalition, on the Arabian peninsula. Initially, Saddam Hussein attempted to deter Coalition military action by threatening Kuwait's and Iraq's petroleum production and export. In December 1990, Iraq experimented with the use of explosives to destroy wellheads {{in the area of the}} Ahmadi loading complex, developing their capability to destroy Kuwait's petroleum infrastructure on a large scale. On 16 January, Iraqi artillery destroyed an oil storage tank in Khafji, Saudi Arabia, and on 19 January the pumps at the Ahmadi loading complex were opened, pouring crude oil into the Persian Gulf. The oil flowed into the sea at a rate of 200,000 barrels a day, becoming one of the worst ecological disasters to that date.|$|E
5|$|The line stopped {{carrying}} {{passengers on}} 5 December 1964, {{as part of}} the rationalisation known as the Beeching Axe. All stations were closed, and all goods yards, passing loops and sidings removed, except the <b>marshalling</b> yard for the Octel freight. Octel's freight traffic totaled 70,000 tons annually, and the railway was kept in order to serve this traffic. Local freight services ceased, and the electric staff system was withdrawn, so that only one train could be on the branch at a time, although that was sufficient for Octel's requirements. The double junction at Gaerwen was also remodelled. Once the freight trains were being worked by diesel locomotives, arrangements were made for the British Rail engines to operate {{all the way to the}} plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{spoil heap}} of Writhlington {{colliery}} {{is now the}} Writhlington Site of Special Scientific Interest, which includes 3,000tons of Upper Carboniferous spoil from which more than 1,400insect fossil specimens have been recovered. The complex geology and narrow seams made coal extraction difficult. Tonnage increased throughout the 19th century, reaching a peak around 1901, when there were 79separate collieries and annual production was 1,250,000tons per annum. However, due to local geological difficulties and manpower shortages output declined {{and the number of}} pits reduced from 30 {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century to 14 by the mid-thirties; the last two pits, Kilmersdon and Writhlington, closed in September 1973. The Great Western Railway and the Somerset and Dorset Railway both established stations and <b>marshalling</b> yards in the town. The last passenger train services to Radstock closed in 1966. Manufacturing industries such as printing, binding and packaging provide some local employment. In recent years, Radstock has increasingly become a commuter town for the nearby cities of Bath and Bristol.|$|E
5000|$|The rank of vice <b>marshal</b> (chasu) {{is unique}} to the North Korean ranking system. Vice <b>marshal</b> was first conferred in February 1953 on Choe Yong Gon. Sources suggest that the {{shoulder}} board rank insignia for <b>marshal</b> and vice <b>marshal</b> then became a single large star without the state coat-of-arms (for <b>marshals)</b> and the state coat-of-arms without a star (for vice <b>marshals).</b> By the time the next conferral of rank to vice <b>marshal</b> was awarded (1985), the shoulder board rank insignia for <b>marshal</b> and vice <b>marshal</b> had taken on their current design.The next change in the DPRK <b>marshal</b> ranks took place in 1992 when the rank of dae wonsu or grand <b>marshal</b> (full title grand <b>marshal</b> of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) was created for Kim Il Sung. At this time the rank of <b>marshal</b> was divided into two ranks: the rank of <b>marshal</b> with the title [...] "marshal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" [...] was conferred upon Kim Il Sung's son Kim Jong-il, and the same rank but with the title [...] "marshal of the Korean People's Army" [...] was conferred upon O Jin U. In 1995, two other military officers were conferred the rank of <b>marshal</b> with the title [...] "marshals of the Korean People's Army", i.e. Choe Kwang and Ri Ul Sol. Insignia of rank of the two grades of <b>marshal</b> are different (with the insignia for <b>marshal</b> of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea being more like that of grand marshal—the grand <b>marshal</b> insignia has a larger wreath encompassing the <b>marshal's</b> star—but is smaller as it is below the star itself).|$|R
50|$|Almost all British <b>marshals</b> are unpaid volunteers {{supplemented}} occasionally {{by certain}} paid crews for special duties. <b>Marshals</b> are {{registered with the}} British governing body, the Motor Sports Association(MSA) and are often members of organisations such as Intervention <b>Marshals</b> UK (IVMUK), the British Motorsport <b>Marshals</b> Club (BMMC), British Automobile Racing Club (BARC) and the Silverstone <b>Marshals</b> Team amongst many others. British <b>marshals</b> {{have been known to}} attend foreign events such as IndyCar, the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and many F1 events worldwide. Motorcycle <b>marshals</b> are organized differently, with support for FIM events coming from Racesafe and Racesafe-accredited <b>marshals.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Marshals</b> of {{branches}} were normally eligible for promotion to chief <b>marshal</b> of branch, however, neither was eligible for promotion to <b>marshal</b> of the Soviet Union. After 1984, {{the rank of}} <b>marshal</b> was preserved only {{in the air force}} and artillery. Later, the rank of <b>marshal</b> stopped being conferred even in these branches. The regulations of Russian Army, confirmed in 1993, unified the system of general ranks in all the branches: the ranks of <b>marshal</b> of artillery and <b>marshal</b> of aviation were replaced by the one of general of the army (or army aviation), and the rank of chief <b>marshal</b> was cancelled.|$|R
5|$|Tibbets {{flew the}} lead bomber Butcher Shop {{for the first}} American {{daylight}} heavy bomber mission on 17 August 1942, a shallow penetration raid against a <b>marshalling</b> yard in Rouen in Occupied France, with Armstrong as his co-pilot. This was not Tibbets's regular aircraft, Red Gremlin, nor his regular crew, which included bombardier Thomas Ferebee and navigator Theodore Van Kirk, who later flew with him in Enola Gay. On 9 October 1942, Tibbets led the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe, attacking industrial targets in the French city of Lille. Poor bombing accuracy resulted in numerous civilian casualties and less damage to the rail installations than hoped, but the mission was hailed an overall success because it reached its target against heavy and constant fighter attack. Of the 108 aircraft in the raid, 33 were shot down or had to turn back due to mechanical problems.|$|E
5|$|Finucane took {{leave in}} early September and his award {{for a second}} Bar was gazetted on 9 September. Circus 100B was flown on 20 September 1941. A three pronged attack was planned {{involving}} 23 squadrons and 270 Spitfires with bomber units acting as decoys. The Kenley wing was to provide escort for bombers hitting <b>marshalling</b> yards at Abbeville. 452 {{was one of three}} squadrons flying high cover. Immediately after crossing the coast at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme they were engaged by enemy aircraft. Finucane hit a Bf 109 which exploded forcing him to fly through the debris but within minutes 452 had lost three Spitfires. Finding himself and his wingman, Sergeant Chisholm alone he shot down a Bf 109 that attempted to attack his squadron-mate. He followed it briefly and it caught fire while emitting white smoke. Another Bf 109 turned in to attack Finucane but was shot down by Chisholm. Fighting their way back to the Channel Finucane dived and shot down a Bf 109 which went into a spin before he lost sight of it at approximately 500ft. Three successes had inflated Finucane's tally to 17.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, McGovern {{joined the}} 741st Squadron of the 455th Bombardment Group of the Fifteenth Air Force, {{stationed}} at San Giovanni Airfield near Cerignola in the Apulia region of Italy. There {{he and his}} crew found a starving, disease-ridden local population wracked by the ill fortunes of war and far worse off than anything they had seen back home during the Depression. Those sights would form part of his later motivation to fight hunger. Starting on November 11, 1944, McGovern flew 35missions over enemy territory from San Giovanni, the first five as co-pilot for an experienced crew and the rest as pilot for his own plane, known as the Dakota Queen after his wife Eleanor. His targets were in Austria; Czechoslovakia; Nazi Germany; Hungary; Poland; and northern, German-controlled Italy, and were often either oil refinery complexes or rail <b>marshalling</b> yards, all {{as part of the}} U.S.strategic bombing campaign in Europe. The eight- or nine-hour missions were grueling tests of endurance for pilots and crew, and while German fighter aircraft were a diminished threat by this time as compared to earlier in the war, his missions often faced heavy anti-aircraft artillery fire that filled the sky with flak bursts.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{court system}} {{is divided into}} 94 federal {{judicial}} districts, each with a district court (except the territory of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, which share a US <b>Marshal).</b> For each district there is a presidentially-appointed and Senate-confirmed United States <b>marshal,</b> a Chief Deputy U.S. <b>Marshal</b> (GS-14 or 15) (and an Assistant Chief Deputy U.S. <b>Marshal</b> (GS-14) in certain larger districts), Supervisory Deputy U.S. <b>Marshals</b> (GS-13), and as many deputy U.S. <b>Marshals</b> (GS-7 and above) and special deputy U.S. <b>Marshals</b> as needed. In the United States federal budget for 2005, funds for 3,067 deputy <b>marshals</b> and criminal investigators were provided. The U.S. <b>Marshal</b> for United States courts of appeals (the 13 circuit courts) is the U.S. <b>Marshal</b> in whose district that court is physically located.|$|R
50|$|The {{ranks of}} chief <b>marshal</b> of the {{branches}} of aviation, artillery, armoured troops, engineer troops, and signals were established October 27, 1943. The three former branches had already had (since February 4, 1943) the corresponding ranks of marshal; in the two latter branches the ranks of <b>marshal</b> and of chief <b>marshal</b> were established simultaneously. When the rank of chief <b>marshal</b> was established, {{the size of the}} shoulder board's stars for all <b>marshals</b> except the now superior <b>marshal</b> of the Soviet Union were made about 10mm smaller and for chief <b>marshals,</b> the star was surrounded by a laurel wreath. On the uniform tie, chief <b>marshals</b> wore the <b>marshal's</b> star of the 2nd level. During the next forty years, the ranks of chief <b>marshal</b> were conferred mainly on deputy defense ministers - commanders of the corresponding branch. The ranks of chief <b>marshal</b> of engineer troops and chief <b>marshal</b> of signals, abolished in 1984, were never conferred on anybody. No chief <b>marshal</b> promotions were conferred after 1984. The youngest chief <b>marshal</b> was aviator Golovanov, 40 when promoted in 1944. Three of thirteen people who held the chief <b>marshal</b> rank did not retire normally: Novikov was imprisoned for seven years; Nedelin perished in the flame of an exploded rocket; Varentsov was accused of heedlessness, dismissed and degraded (his subordinate, Oleg Penkovsky, had been found to be a spy).|$|R

5|$|On 19 December, {{the first}} winter storm struck the French squadron. In the heavy waves and high winds, first Windham and then Vénus were {{separated}} from the convoy, Manche <b>marshalling</b> the remaining ships and continuing the southwards journey. Windhams French prize crew were able {{to regain control of}} their ship and continued on to Île de France alone, but Vénus was struck by an even larger hurricane on 27 December and lost all three topmasts in the gale. The French crew panicked as the storm began, and refused to attend to the sails or even close the hatches: as a result the vessel almost founded as huge amounts of water poured into the ship. In desperation, Hamelin called Captain Stewart to his cabin and requested that his men save the ship but demanded that Stewart give his word that his men would not attempt to escape or seize the frigate. Stewart refused to give any such guarantee but agreed to help repair the damage and bring the ship to safety. After securing the weapons lockers aboard, Hamelin agreed and Stewart and his men cut away the wrecked masts and pumped the water out of the hold, repairing the ship so {{that she was able to}} continue her journey without fear of foundering.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June, the French {{units were}} warned {{an hour before}} the German bombers took off, but owing to equally poor staff work, few French squadrons heard the {{scramble}} signal when it was radioed from the Eiffel Tower and some were caught on the ground. In the end, only eighty took off to intercept the incoming German formations. German progress was monitored by shadowing Potez 631s, one of which was shot down. The Germans would copy this tactic when intercepting United States Army Air Force (USAAF) heavy bombers during the Defence of the Reich campaign. Along with French AAA defences, the fighters shot down ten German aircraft, including four bombers. One of these machines was piloted by Geschwaderkommodore of KG 51, Josef Kammhuber, who was wounded in action and taken as a prisoner of war. Kammhuber would be released after the French surrender. He was replaced as Geschwaderkommodore of KG 51 by Fisser, commander of KG 77. Fisser was killed two months later leading KG 51 during the Battle of Britain.Jagdfliegerführer 3 (Fighter Flying Leader 3) Oberst Gerd von Massow was also shot down. He was replaced by Oberst Werner Junck, until the former's release by German forces on 12 June 1940. German formations attacked twenty-eight railways and <b>marshalling</b> yard centres. All damage inflicted was light. None were out of action for more than 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|The Allies also {{conducted}} a major air offensive against the French railway network and bridges {{over the river}} Seine from April to June. Bomber Command made 53 raids against these targets, of which 25 involved the four Australian heavy bomber squadrons. A total of 17 Australian bombers were lost during these operations, including six that German fighters shot down during {{an attack on the}} <b>marshalling</b> yards at Lille on the night of 10/11 May. In addition, Australians took part in 29 of the 46 raids conducted by 2TAF's light bombers against French railway infrastructure. Australian fighter pilots, including all of No.453 Squadron on occasion, escorted some of these raids and conducted ground attack sorties targeting railway rolling stock. 2TAF's fighter-bombers also attacked bridges over the river Seine from April {{as part of an effort}} to seal off the Normandy region, and Australian pilots posted to British squadrons were involved in a small number of these operations. No.453 Squadron attacked bridges and viaducts near Normandy on 27 April and 2 May.|$|E
50|$|The Brazilian Air Force {{does not}} use air <b>marshal</b> ranks as an {{equivalent}} to general ranks, rather it uses a number of ranks based on the word brigadier. However, its highest rank is marechal-do-ar, the equivalent to a Brazilian Army <b>marshal.</b> Marechal-do-ar can be translated as air <b>marshal</b> or <b>marshal</b> of the air.
