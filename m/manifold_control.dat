40|$|The control {{problem of}} an {{electromechanical}} system becomes more complex when the flexibility and friction {{are taken into}} account in the system model. To approach this problem, an electromechanical system is studied in this research as a system model which is composed of a motor driving a load through a flexible belt. The work of this thesis proposes a new integral <b>manifold</b> <b>control</b> design to achieve desired system performance based on the integral <b>manifold</b> <b>control</b> techniques. The compensation of friction is performed with a new friction compensation component in the integral <b>manifold</b> <b>control</b> algorithm. A detailed derivation of the integral <b>manifold</b> <b>control</b> law is given for regulation systems with a method of calculating control gains in the final control algorithm. A further study on the regulation system is conducted by selecting a set of control parameters based on the system characteristic equation, while a switching integral manifold phenomena is illustrated for tracking systems by exploiting system performance in state space. Simulation and experimental results are presented that show a consistent improvement in the system performance with the integral <b>manifold</b> <b>control</b> design strategy...|$|E

This paper presents control algorithms developed {{to compensate for}} hysteresis {{in the presence of}} kinematic error (KE) for precision position tracking applications with known smooth load on the output side. A model of hysteresis with a linear flexibility part and nonlinear dissipative part represented by a differential equation is used. The model is integrated with kinematic error model to obtain a set of equations governing system dynamics. First, a singularly perturbed model of the drive is derived from this set of equations. The proposed algorithm is then developed using integral <b>manifold</b> <b>control</b> approach involving slow and fast control terms.

40|$|AbstractEdge {{effects and}} Gibbs {{phenomena}} are a ubiquitous problem in signal processing. We show how this problem can arise from a mismatch between the “topology” {{of the data}} D (e. g., an interval {{in the case of}} a time series or a rectangle {{in the case of a}} photographic image) and the topology X (often a circle or tours) natural to the construction of the transformation O. The notion of a <b>manifold</b> <b>control</b> space X for an orthogonal transformation O is introduced. It is proved that no matter how complicated X is, O may be “truncated” to an O′ with control space D, homeomorphic to an interval or a product of intervals. This yields a new, topologically motivated approach to edge effects. We give the complete details for applying this approach to the discrete Daubechies transform of functions on the unit interval so that no data are wrapped around from one end of the interval to the other...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we build}} the {{foundation}} for a theory of controlled rough paths on manifolds. A number of natural candidates for the definition of <b>manifold</b> valued <b>controlled</b> rough paths are developed and shown to be equivalent. The theory of controlled rough one-forms along such a controlled path and their resulting integrals are then defined. This general integration theory does require the introduction of an additional geometric structure on the manifold which we refer to as a "parallelism. " The transformation properties of the theory under change of parallelisms is explored. Using these transformation properties, it is shown that the integration of a smooth one-form along a <b>manifold</b> valued <b>controlled</b> rough path is in fact well defined independent of any additional geometric structures. We present a theory of push-forwards and show how it is compatible with our integration theory. Lastly, we give a number of characterizations for solving a rough differential equation when the solution is interpreted as a controlled rough path on a manifold and then show such solutions exist and are unique.
