More specifically, the neural patterns associated with human arm and hand actions were studied to determine the efficacy of using these myoelectric signals to control the manipulator arm of a robot. The advantage of this approach to robotic control was the use of well-defined and well-practiced neural patterns already available to the system, as opposed to requiring the human operator to learn new tasks and establish new neural patterns in learning to control a joystick or <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>device...</b>|$|E
40|$|BackgroundPartially resecting ribs of the {{recipient}} site to facilitate easy anastomosis of the internal mammary vessels to free flaps during breast reconstruction can cause chest wall pain or deformities. To avoid this, the intercostal perforating branches of the internal mammary vessels {{can be used for}} anastomosis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the location and size of the internal mammary perforator vessels based on clinical intraoperative findings and to determine their reliability as recipient vessels for breast reconstruction with microsurgical free tissue transfer. MethodsTwelve patients were preoperatively screened for the presence of internal mammary perforators using Doppler tracing. After modified radical mastectomy was performed by a general surgeon, the location and size of the internal mammary perforator vessels were microscopically investigated. The external diameter was examined using a vessel-measuring gauge from a <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>device,</b> and the distance from the mid-sternal line to the perforator was also measured. ResultsThe largest arterial perforator averaged 1. 5 mm, and the largest venous perforator averaged 2. 2 mm. Perforators emerging from the second intercostal space had the largest average external diameter; the second intercostal space also had the largest number of perforators arising from it. The average distance from the mid-sternal line to the perforator was 20. 2 mm. ConclusionsInternal mammary perforators presented consistent and reliable anatomy in this study. Based on these results, the internal mammary perforators appear to have a suitable diameter for microvascular anastomosis and should be considered as an alternative recipient vessel to the internal mammary vessel...|$|E

40|$|A {{coupling}} coefficient {{is a measure}} of the effectiveness with which a shape-changing material (or a device employing such a material) converts the energy in an imposed signal to useful <b>mechanical</b> energy. <b>Device</b> <b>coupling</b> coefficients are properties of the device and, although related to the material {{coupling coefficient}}s, are generally different from them. This invention describes a class of devices wherein the apparent coupling coefficient can, in principle, approach 1. 0, corresponding to perfect electromechanical energy conversion. The key feature of this class of devices is the use of destabilizing mechanical pre-loads to counter inherent stiffness. The approach is illustrated for piezoelectric and thermoelectrically actuated devices. The invention provides a way to simultaneously increase both displacement and force, distinguishing it from alternatives such as motion amplification, and allows transducer designers to achieve substantial performance gains for actuator and sensor devices...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the effect of <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> on the frequency behavior of the two oscillators in the SOA- 3 micromechanical accelerometer. It also investigates the possible effect of the input acceleration on the degree of this <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling.</b> A sensitivity study is also done to assess the dependence of the degree of <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> on the geometry of the beams that form the proof mass support system. By doing a modal analysis using both a Finite Element and a mass-spring model of the accelerometer, it is shown that <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> does exist between the two oscillators, and {{is a function of the}} input acceleration on the device. It is also shown that the effects of <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> on the frequencies of the oscillators are the greatest at the input acceleration where the oscillator's frequencies, if completely uncoupled, would approach the same value. Finally, several design changes are suggested that reduce the amount of <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> between the oscillators. by Kara Susanne Meredith. Thesis (S. M. and S. B.)

In the first generation systems the tug is connected to the barge by wires or chains. However, because the two vessels are subject to different motion responses due to their shape, displacement and position on a wave, such operation is only possible in calm sea conditions — in rough weather the tug has to disconnect from the barge and continue the journey by towing it in a traditional way. The second generation systems are designed with a deeper stern notch and improved <b>coupling</b> <b>devices</b> to allow operation in heavier seas while still permitting relative motion between the two vessels. The third generation systems such as the Finnpusku system, equipped with rigid or articulated <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling,</b> allow operation in all sea states and even in ice conditions as the pusher-barge combination behaves hydrodynamically like a conventional ship. However, in some cases the specialized hull form of the pusher, designed to form a streamlined hull when coupled to the barge, might lead to problems with stability and seakeeping when the pusher is operated independently.|$|R
