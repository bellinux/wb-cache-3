The AOC status only applies to wines produced from the harvest gathered two years after the year in which the vines were planted (before 31 August).|$|R
40|$|Ten {{species of}} Cephalopoda are described. One species, Eeachia atlantica (Degner, 1925), is repor-ted {{for the first}} time since the {{original}} description. Most of the specimens are larvae or juveniles. The Galathea Deep-Sea Expedition of 1950 - 52 col-lected 16 specimens of cephalopods, pertaining to ten species, off the West African coast. The station list and species collected are given in Table 1. Since the tropical eastern Atlantic has been fairly well sampled (see Clarke 1966, fig. 1) the present collec-tion contains no new species. However, one of the species described, Leachia atlantica (Degner, 1925) is reported {{for the first time}} since the original de-scription. Most of the specimens in the present collection are larvae or juveniles. This may be due to the ability of cephalopods, and especially of the larger animals, to avoid nets. In this respect it is of interest to note that ail the types of fishing gear listed in Table 1, with the exception of the shrimp otter trawl, have an opening of 3 m or less. It is also interesting that six species (10 specimens) of cephalopods were collected at Station 8, as opposed to only one species (1 - 3 specimens) at each of the other stations, since the haul at Station 8 was carried out after dark whereas the others were made by daylight (Table 1).

The ground between the creek and {{the bank of the}} river, which contains most of the remnants of the water supply system, has been kept clear of trees and larger shrubs. Some regrowth has occurred outside of this area and the creek is overgrown with vegetation. Scatters of machinery parts and building materials can be found along the banks and in the dry stream bed. Remnant pieces of machinery can be found scattered around the area close to the engines although some of these pieces have been gathered and stored to protect them from theft.|$|R

This {{is quoted}} {{in a very}} {{valuable}} selection of French estimates and expressions of opinion, forming chapter iv. of La Liquidation financière de la Guerre, by H. Charriaut and R. Hacault. The general magnitude of my estimate is further confirmed by {{the extent of the}} repairs already effected, as set forth in a speech delivered by M. Tardieu on October 10, 1919, in which he said: [...] "On September 16 last, of 2246 kilomètres of railway track destroyed, 2016 had been repaired; of 1075 kilomètres of canal, 700; of 1160 constructions, such as bridges and tunnels, which had been blown up, 588 had been replaced; of 550,000 houses ruined by bombardment, 60,000 had been rebuilt; and of 1,800,000 hectares of ground rendered useless by battle, 400,000 had been recultivated, 200,000 hectares of which are now ready to be sown. Finally, more than 10,000,000 <b>mètres</b> of barbed <b>wire</b> had been removed." ...|$|R
50|$|At Central Station's opening, tracks (7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12) of the Tunnel Station {{were used}} only by trains heading north through the tunnel, {{and did not}} {{continue}} south of the station. These tracks were finally connected to the south when the old Tunnel Station was demolished {{as well as the}} warehouse located south of De la Gauchetière Street and east of Inspector Street (now Mansfield Street). This also allowed for the construction of the new headquarters of CNR as well as Place Bonaventure. This division is once again in effect following the rebuilding of the Deux-Montagnes line. These tracks are now part of the Two Mountains Subdivision, extending south for a distance of about 1600 <b>metres.</b> Under catenary <b>wires,</b> they serve as parking for trains on the Deux-Montagnes line during the day. Since the reopening of the Mont-Saint-Hilaire line, they are also used to park trains from this line.|$|R
5000|$|The torc {{dates from}} 200-50 BC and {{is made from}} twisted gold wires. Forty-eight 2mm wires were twisted in pairs to form 24 wires. Then three of these paired wires were twisted {{together}} {{in the opposite direction}} to make a rope (comprising six original wires). These eight thicker ropes were then twisted together to form the body of the torc. In total, 25 <b>metres</b> of gold <b>wire</b> was used to form the torc. The hollow gold terminals, in a ring shape, were cast using the lost wax method, and is decorated in the La Tène style with moulded raised decoration of trumpet voids and circles, highlighted with pellets and cold hammering. [...] The torc is similar to the Great Torc from Snettisham and also to the Ipswich torcs, all of which are also in the British Museum. It is considered so similar to the Newark Torc, found in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, that it might have been made by the same craftsman.|$|R

5000|$|Göth's actions at Płaszów Labour Camp became {{internationally known}} through his {{depiction}} by British actor Ralph Fiennes in the 1993 film Schindler's List. In an interview, Fiennes recalled: [...] People believe that they’ve {{got to do}} a job, they’ve got to take on an ideology, that they’ve got a life to lead; they’ve got to survive, a job to do, it’s every day inch by inch, little compromises, little ways of telling yourself this is how you should lead your life and suddenly then these things can happen. I mean, I could make a judgment myself privately, this is a terrible, evil, horrific man. But the job was to portray the man, the human being. There’s a sort of banality, that everydayness, that I think was important. And it was in the screenplay. In fact, one of the first scenes with Oskar Schindler, with Liam Neeson, was a scene where I’m saying, 'You don’t understand how hard it is, I have to order so many—so many <b>metres</b> of barbed <b>wire</b> and so many fencing posts and I have to get so many people from A to B.' And, you know, he’s sort of letting off steam about the difficulties of the job.|$|R

Reducing congestion in our nation's urban areas has become a top priority of state departments of transportation nationwide. The development and construction of freeway management systems have recently begun to help reduce these problems. A major component of freeway management systems is the inductance loop detector. This research effort evaluated the use of inductance loop detectors in a freeway management situation to determine maximum permissible lead lengths and an optimal speed trap distance. Lead lengths were evaluated with five different design vehicles (large and small passenger cars, a pickup truck, a motorcycle, and a high profile truck) with several detector units. Both passenger cars and the pickup truck were always detected with 4000 feet (1220 <b>metres)</b> of lead <b>wire</b> on all combinations of sensitivity level and number of wire turns. The detection of the motorcycle and high profile truck depended upon the sensitivity level and number of wire turns used. The data also indicate that detection of the passenger vehicles may be possible at distances much greater than 4000 feet (1220 metres). An extrapolation of the inductance measurements indicate that detection of passenger vehicles at 8000 feet (2440 metres) is likely, and detections may even be possible at much large distances. Lead lengths of this magnitude give the designer greater flexibility in producing the most functional and cost-effective design. Five different speed trap distances (from 20 to 80 feet, 6 to 24 metres) were evaluated with a variety of detector units. An optimal speed trap distance was not able to be identified, but the research consistently identified that accurate speed measurements cannot be made using different models of detector units. In order for speed measurements to be accurate, the change in inductance required for detection must be very similar between detector units. Identical make and model detector units easily meet this criteria. The error measured for speed traps with identical detector units averaged about 1. 5 mph (2. 4 km/h) for all speeds, while errors for speed traps with different detector units varied widely from one to 120 mph (1. 6 to 194 km/h). Clearly, the best method for obtaining accurate speeds with inductance loop detectors utilizes identical make and model detector units...|$|R
