[...] "That's What My Heart Needs" [...] and [...] "Mary's Little Lamb" [...] were recorded in June 1963. The latter is the only Redding track with both background singing and brass. It became his worst-selling single. The title track, recorded in September 1963, sparked copyright issues, as it sounded like Irma Thomas's [...] "Ruler of My Heart".

500|$|In early 2001, Spears {{said that}} she had plans to make her film debut. She and her team then created a concept for it, which was later {{developed}} by Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rimes. Spears commented that she [...] "talked to [...] and told her what I wanted the movie to be about and she elaborated on it. It was my little project.

It also featured a cover of Elton John's [...] "Ball and Chain", from his 1982 album Jump Up! Ruhlmann found this album superior to its predecessor, stating that Reynolds [...] "seems to have shaped the song selections to the singer's talents and given her the opportunity to sing in a more individual manner." [...] A review of the album in Billboard was also positive, noting the [...] "more focused direction and a simpler, purer sound".|$|E

500|$|In early 2001, Spears and {{her team}} {{developed}} a script for a movie where the singer could be the main role.

[...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman", written by Dido, Max Martin and Rami, was originally intended to be included on the movie's soundtrack, but after JIVE Records decided not to release a soundtrack, Spears later decided to use it on her third studio album, Britney (2001).|$|E

500|$|Plans for Lopez {{to release}} a Spanish {{language}} album materialized in 2004, when Lopez's then-husband Marc Anthony was finishing up production of his ninth studio album Amar Sin Mentiras (2004) with Estéfano and Julio Reyes. Lopez went into the recording studio with them to record a song entitled [...] "Escapémonos", as a duet with Anthony. She enjoyed working on the song {{so much that she}} decided to record a full-length Spanish album; something she had wanted to do for years. Prior to breaking out into the music scene in May 1999 with her single [...] "If You Had My Love", Lopez always pictured her music career to be in Spanish. According to Lopez: [...] "My life took a different turn, which was great for me. But <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> always kind of on the Spanish side." [...] Before recording began for her first Spanish album, Lopez recorded and released her fourth English studio album Rebirth (2005).|$|E
500|$|While still {{performing}} as the vocalist of Icelandic alternative rock group the Sugarcubes, Björk approached both Ásmundur Jónsson of Bad Taste and producer Derek Birkett of One Little Indian Records with a demo cassette {{of her own}} songs on which she had been working. These demos included versions of songs that would appear on Debut, including [...] "The Anchor Song" [...] and [...] "Aeroplane". After the Sugarcubes went on hiatus, she moved to London, England, where she and Birkett worked {{on the details of}} what would become Debut. Björk has admitted that The Sugarcube's music was not her taste, and that her contact with London's underground club culture of the late 1980s/early 1990s helped her find her own musical identity. She said: [...] "...as a music nerd, I just had to follow my heart, and <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> those beats that were happening in England. And maybe what I'm understanding more and more as I get older, is that music like Kate Bush has really influenced me. Brian Eno. Acid. Electronic beats. Labels like Warp." ...|$|E
500|$|Aronofsky had {{the idea}} for The Wrestler for over a decade. He hired Robert D. Siegal to turn his idea into a script. The actor Nicolas Cage entered {{negotiations}} in October 2007 to star as Randy, the film's protagonist. The following month Cage left the project, and Mickey Rourke replaced him in the lead role. Aronofsky said that Cage {{pulled out of the}} movie because Aronofsky wanted Rourke to star; Aronofsky said, stating that Cage was [...] "a complete gentleman, and he understood that <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but, you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he pulled himself out of the race." [...] Cage responded, [...] "I wasn't quote 'dropped' from the movie. I resigned from the movie because I didn't think I had enough time to achieve the look of the wrestler who was on steroids, which I would never do". The roughly 40-day shoot began in January 2008.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of her first album, Milano {{appeared}} in Japanese advertisements for pasta and chocolate milk; the jingles from the advertisements were written by producer Joey Carbone, and were later included on Milano's albums and released as singles. Milano's debut studio album Look in <b>My</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>was</b> released in March 1989, and peaked at number 68 on the Oricon Albums Chart. Milano's music incorporated prominent elements of bubblegum pop and dance-pop. Carbone was responsible for much of the album's songwriting and production, and Milano's father also contributed as co-writer of three songs. Prior {{to the release}} of her debut album, Milano released an exercise video, titled Alyssa Milano's Teen Steam, and recorded its theme song along with a rap. Milano's rap was written by producers Jason Hervey and Ryan Lambert. Milano's second studio album Alyssa was released later that year, peaked at number 15 on the Oricon Albums Chart and was certified platinum. A majority of the songwriters and producers from Look in My Heart handled the creation of its follow-up album, for which Milano earned her first songwriting credit as co-writer of [...] "We Need the Children".|$|E
500|$|With [...] "Ironic", Morissette denoted {{her support}} for {{same-sex}} marriage. In March 2004, Morissette amended a lyric at the fifteenth annual GLAAD Media Awards: [...] "It's meeting {{the man of}} my dreams /And then meeting his beautiful husband". She commented to USA Today that her support about same-sex unions [...] "goes a step further than clever lyrics." [...] She remarked that [...] " [...] fantasy would now be to marry some of [...] gay couple friends." [...] Later in June 2004, she said to VH1: [...] "I don't have any gay-couple friends who are formally engaged, but I would be honored to support the gay community in that way ... I did it {{as a sort of}} spontaneous thing at a radio station about a month ago with a couple, and <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> so with them." [...] Morissette recorded an acoustic version of the song with the changed lyric for her iTunes Originals release, in 2004. Another acoustic version was recorded for the album Jagged Little Pill Acoustic, as well for the compilation album Cities 97 Sampler, Volume 16 (2004). The song was also performed in a duo with Avril Lavigne at the House of Blues in 2005.|$|E
500|$|By coincidence, Olympic team {{training}} {{took place}} in Tarwater's hometown of Knoxville. At the Olympics, Tarwater swam the third leg of the preliminary round of the men's 4×200-meter relay. His time of 1:46.33 was a personal best, and the second-fastest leg for Team USA, which turned in the fastest preliminary swim, and third-fastest among all 64 swimmers. He attributed his performance to concentrating exclusively on the freestyle during the two months between Trials and the Games. Of his Olympic experience, Tarwater said, [...] "Even at 28, {{with a lot of}} international experience, nothing matches the Olympics. [...] <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> pumping so intensely that I was just trying to calm myself down. [...] Standing on the blocks, waiting to take the exchange, I was just saying, 'Breathe. [...] Breathe. [...] Breathe.'... It's such a rush." [...] Typically, the relay team for the finals is composed of the top two qualifiers plus the two fastest swimmers in the preliminaries. In 2012, however, the U.S. team had its top three swimmers in reserve, as Phelps would swim the relay final despite dropping the individual 200-meter freestyle from his program. [...] After Tarwater's fast preliminary swim, the U.S. coaches strongly considered replacing number three Olympic Trials qualifier Ricky Berens with Tarwater in the finals, before electing to go with Berens due to Berens' greater experience. In the finals, the U.S. relay team beat the second-place French team by three seconds, winning Tarwater a gold medal.|$|E

[...] "It was a basketball game – the school Harry attended was playing my school. I was just graduating from junior high. Well, I looked across the gym and saw Harry, and I {{fell in love}}. <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E
