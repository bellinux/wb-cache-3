50|$|The {{number of}} Iranians in Japan began to expand {{significantly}} in 1988, after {{the cessation of}} hostilities in the Iran-Iraq War. Demobilized Iranian soldiers became involved in shuttle trade, buying electronics in Tokyo and smuggling them back to Iran to sell at high prices; due to a <b>mutual</b> visa <b>exemption</b> agreement between Japan and Iran, concluded in 1974, {{they were able to}} enter and exit Japan freely. As word spread about the favourable economic conditions in Japan, increasing number of Iranians took advantage of visa-free entry to find jobs and settle in Japan; they were attracted by wages which remained high compared to Iran even after the 1990 bursting of the Japanese asset price bubble, and relatively lax enforcement of immigration policy. In those days, Iran Air had only one flight per week going to Tokyo; during the peak period, prospective migrants had to book their tickets several years in advance. However, in 1992, prompted by worsening economic conditions, Japan terminated the visa-free agreement with Iran, and began serious efforts to deport illegal overstayers. Though small numbers of Iranians turned to people smugglers to gain entrance to Japan, the total size of the Iranian population in Japan would shrink dramatically over the following decade, as the number of new migrants remained small compared to the number of deportations.|$|R

The cross-border institutional arrangements indicate a trend of internationalization of social security system throughout the world. Since accession to the WTO {{in the end of}} last century, China attracts much international capital and output quite a lot of domestic capital and labor to other countries for its rapid economic development. Meanwhile, the transnational communication and cooperation in the field of social security issues have become increasingly frequent, and some signs of internationalization process in social security system of China are visible. For example, China has signed bilateral social security agreement on <b>mutual</b> <b>exemption</b> with Germany and South Korea. As social security system of China has been established for less than sixty years and lacks the experience in international cooperation, the internationalization process of social security of China is still in its initial stage.
