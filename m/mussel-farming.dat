40|$|Sea-bed benthic-invertebrate assemblages {{of species}} within and {{proximal}} to an existing mussel farm off Taniwhanui Point, eastern Waiheke Island, are reported. Substratum type, whether predominantly mud, gravels or an admixture of the two, mud/gravels, {{is shown to}} influence infaunal species assemblage composition; the bivalve Theora lubrica, ostracods, amphipods and polychaetes characterise muddy substrata; polychaetes, particularly spionids and syllids, ostracods, amphipods, bivalves and ophiuroids characterise mud/gravel substrata; and diverse assemblages of polychaetes, bivalves, pagurid crabs, gastropods, ostracods, ophiuroids and nemertean worms characterise gravel substrata. Significant differences in sea-bed assemblages are reported along one transect {{inside and outside the}} farm over the three seasons during which surveys were conducted, summer, autumn, winter of 2008. Along the northern side of the mussel farm those sediments beneath the farm are characterised by greater abundances of polychaetes and crustaceans (Malacostraca), whereas sediments outside the farm are characterised by greater abundances of bivalves and ostracods. Sediments {{both inside and outside the}} north-eastern border of the farm during summer are characterised by similar abundances of polychaetes, bivalves and ostracods. Similarly, those sediments within and outside the farm along its southern border during summer are characterised by abundances of polychaetes, bivalves, crustaceans (Malacostraca) and gastropods. Measures of relative abundance, rarity and species richness are applied to sea-bed assemblages off eastern Waiheke Island to enable an appraisal of the spatial distribution of each within and outside the farm, and throughout the eastern Waiheke Island region. One of these measures, relative abundance, is then compared with other, albeit limited abundance data from previous soft-sediment surveys conducted throughout Hauraki Gulf. The most species rich and abundant sites off eastern Waiheke Island occur in gravelly substrata between Waiheke Island and Pakatoa Island, and between Rotoroa and Ponui Islands, in addition to beneath the southern portion of the existing mussel farm. Gravel-based substrata are recognised to be the most species rich and densely populated with invertebrates for this sediment type in Hauraki Gulf. Similarly, the muddy substrata off eastern Waiheke Island region appear to host more individuals and species than any other reported muddy substratum in Hauraki Gulf. The existing mussel farm is shown to significantly affect sea-bed communities, but in a manner that has not been previously reported in New Zealand. Species richness and abundance are greater beneath the farm, as are the proportions of very rare and uncommon taxa to more common and ubiquitous taxa. Sediments beneath the farm are not characterised by elevated abundances and richness of opportunistic species; and no obvious difference in sediment grain size is apparent along a transect extending from 20 m inside the farm to at least 110 m outside it. The biological footprint of the farm is limited, appearing to extend no further than 20 metres from the northern physical boundary of the farm; the gross sedimentary characteristics (grain size) do not differ significantly within and outside the farm. Within and immediately outside the farm species richness and abundance tend to increase during colder seasons; beneath the farm, species richness (d), abundance (N), Shannon index (H’) and Simpson index (1 -λ’) were higher during May (autumn) and August (winter) than during February (summer); diversity values outside the farm were similar during summer and autumn, but species richness (d), evenness (J’), Shannon index (H’) and Simpson index (1 -λ’) were all greater during winter. No opportunistic taxa are considered to be appropriate indicators of organically enriched environments, at least enrichment that can be intuitively linked to any direct effect of the existing mussel farm. One species, the heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum, only rarely occurs inside the physical farm boundary, so its relative abundance renders it an appropriate indicator species of <b>mussel-farm</b> impacts...|$|R
50|$|In 1981 {{the first}} {{specially}} designed mussel-processing factory started operations at Havelock, {{at the head}} of the sounds. Havelock has become the main centre for landing harvested mussels, with other smaller processing plants at French Pass, Elaine Bay, Okiwi Bay and Rai Valley. People are needed to manage and work the farms, and to harvest and transport the mussels to the processing plants. As a result, the <b>mussel-farming</b> industry has become closely linked to several local communities.|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of mussels in the Galicia region has been historically {{characterized by an}} offer consisting {{of a large number}} of producers, while demand was concentrated in a small number of canning companies. Moreover, while canning represents more than half of the demand for mussel farmers, the percentage weight of the mussel in the {{production of}} canned food is still modest. In this scenario, prices were clearly favourable to the industry. Since the mid- 70 's, mussel producers, have made great efforts in building partnerships and sales outlets that have enabled them to create a monopoly of supply to cope with the power of the demand. This is the proof that in times of greatest organizational strength, a stronger growth in prices is achieved, while organizational tensions are quickly exploited by the demand to act in the opposite direction.

40|$|In work {{performed}} {{during the period}} February-October 1996, about 47 species of ciliates were detected in the communities of Aufwuchs, or periphyton, colonizing glass substrates submerged in three sites in the Lagoon of Venice, two in the urban area of Chioggia and one at a <b>mussel-farming</b> site. The ciliate communities were composed of sessile forms of Peritrichia and Suctoria and of motile ciliates, belonging especially to Hypotrichia and Karyorelictea. Four species of the peritrich Zoothamnium and the suctorians Acineta tuberosa and Ephelota gemmipara are reported {{here for the first}} time in the Lagoon of Venice. The richest ciliate communities were recovered at 60 cm from the bottom. Processed by multivariate analysis, data of samplings performed up to day ten from the positioning of glass slides indicated significant differences in biotic and physico-chemical parameters, according to season. The first data did not give definite indications on the possibility of using ciliates colonizing solid surfaces to assess the quality of this peculiar environment...|$|E
40|$|Concentrations {{of eight}} {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, benzo[ghi]perylene) were determined in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) collected between June and September 1995 from 10 locations along a sound of sea formed by two inlets (Mar Piccolo) close to the Gulf of Taranto (Ionian Sea, Italy). In mussels the concentrations of total PAHs were between 14. 8 and 645. 3 mug/kg wet weight. Among the single identified compounds, the predominance of phenanthrene (29. 5 mug/kg wet weight) and anthracene (64. 7 mug/kg wet weight) was evident. Another relevant pollutant was pyrene (18. 4 mug/kg wet weight) followed by fluoranthene (7. 2 mug/kg wet weight), whereas the other compounds showed low levels. The mussels that showed the highest total concentrations of PAHs were collected from stations affected by stronger human activities (industrial fallout, urban wastewaters, and contaminants transported via riverine discharge). Our results {{were similar to those}} found in areas classified as moderately polluted.

40|$|The {{morphology}} and morphogenesis {{of a new}} marine hypotrich ciliate, Apokeronopsis bergeri nov. spec., {{collected from}} <b>mussel-farming</b> waters near Qingdao, China, are described from living and protargol-impregnated specimens. This ciliate has characteristics that place it in the family Pseudokeronopsidae, namely, two long rows of frontal cirri (bicorona), which are continuous with the long midventral rows, and a single row of marginal cirri {{on each side of}} the body. It shares with its only congener, Apokeronopsis crassa, the long rows of buccal and transverse cirri and the wide spacing between the midventral rows of cirri. These characters separate the genus Apokeronopsis from Pseudokeronopsis, which has a single buccal cirrus, fewer transverse cirri and midventral rows of cirri arranged in a typical zig-zag pattern. A. bergeri differs from A. crassa in its shape, colour and in the numbers of membranelles and transverse cirri. Although morphogenesis in A. bergeri is similar to that of A. crassa in most respects, the mode of formation of the buccal cirri is slightly different. The close relationship of A. bergeri with A. crassa, and the more distant relationship with three Pseudokeronopsis species, is supported by a comparison of the sequences of their ITS 1 - 5. 8 S-ITS 2 rDNA regions...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} and morphogenesis {{of a new}} marine hypotrichous ciliate Pseudoamphisiella elongata sp. nov. {{isolated from}} <b>mussel-farming</b> waters near Qingdao, China, are described based on living and protargolimpregnated specimens. Morphologically, the new species can be distinguished from its known congeners by its elongate body shape, narrow oral field, having fewer dorsal kineties and caudal cirri, more marginal cirri, and differentiated pretransverse cirri. The identification as a new species is firmly supported by the sequences of the small subunit ribosomal rRNA (SSU rRNA) gene, compared with other known Pseudoamphisiella species, and the phylogenetic analysis. The morphogenetic characteristics can be summarized as follows: (1) the parental adoral zone of membranelles and undulating membranes are entirely rebuilt by the oral primordium, which develops de novo in the outermost region of the cortex; (2) the oral primordium in the opisthe and the frontoventral–transverse (FVT) anlagen in both dividers are formed independently on the cell surface; (3) an ‘extra’ marginal anlage originates {{to the right of}} the right marginal anlage, and develops into two or three ‘extra’ marginal cirri; (4) the FVT anlagen develop in the primary mode, and the last FVT streak contributes two migratory cirri (frontoterminal cirri), which are probably resorbed; (5) the right marginal anlagen in both dividers occur close together, independent of the old structure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{sets out}} an {{evaluation}} of profitability differentials within shellfish farming activities of the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay. The objective is to examine whether profitability differentials have consequences {{in terms of economic}} dynamics and of management arrangements. The paper divides into four parts. The first part presents a retrospective analysis of shellfish farming activities in the Bay, which are nowadays dominated by Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and Blue mussel (Mytilus edulis). The second part consists in measuring the economic performances of enterprises. The indicators are based on the data provided by two surveys conducted in 2002 (<b>mussel-farming)</b> and 2004 (oyster-farming); methodological difficulties due in particular to the status of shellfish farming land are addressed here. The third part examines the determinants of the profitability for each sector, the profitability being the result of a combination of factors such as natural productivity, technical practices, production costs and products pricing. The last part discusses the implications of profitability differentials. Profitability differentials seem to be correctly reflected in land prices, but not necessarily in the annual ground fees perceived by the Administration. However, shellfish farming profitability should be included in redistributive mechanisms, as its relation to primary resources exploitation and management is not neutral. Thus, empirical evidence suggests that profitability differentials create bargaining powers which influence the results of negotiation between actors regarding the management of the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay...|$|E
40|$|Small-scale {{mussel farming}} {{in the coastal}} area of Chalastra (Thermaikos Gulf, Greece) has faced major {{problems}} {{during the last decade}} due to environmental limitations and to institutional constraints imposed by the absence of local planning and development policies. The aim of our work was to demonstrate crucial aspects of implementing the Systems Approach Framework (SAF) in the area, and more specifically to explain: (a) the key parts of a bioeconomic model that constitutes the basis of a draft management tool, (b) the results of several investigative scenarios examined through the management tool, and (c) the stakeholders' feedback through the participative procedures. The goal was to evaluate the effects of the SAF implementation on the communication between scientists, policy makers, and local stakeholders. The scenarios refer to alternative farming techniques and different environmental conditions, and examine the effects of institutional deficiencies in qualitative and quantitative ways, regarding the sustainability of the activity. The selection of the scenarios was directed from the need to provide a dialogue platform between the conflicting stakeholders. The results clearly demonstrate the effects of <b>mussel-farming</b> techniques on mussel production, as well as the impacts of environmental conditions, human decisions, and institutional choices on the regional (and individual) economic welfare. In the bottom line, the value of the SAF is demonstrated through the apprehension of the policy issue, its impacts, and the alternative management perspectives, as well as through the establishment of a multidimensional collaboration group for the area, which is essential for the further development of the management tool and the implementation of an integrated management policy...|$|E
