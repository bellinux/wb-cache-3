40|$|Formed in 1621, the West India Company (WIC) {{occupied}} the northeastern of Brazil, {{the region that}} produced sugar. Featuring <b>mixed</b> <b>investments,</b> the <b>company</b> would have been conceived by Calvinists who fled from Belgium because of religious persecution that occurred in that country. In Amsterdam, {{the capital of the}} province of Holland, those Calvinists made an association with merchants who wanted to trade spices in the New World. Since 1599, {{in the context of the}} Iberian Union, ports in the sugar region were closed by the Crown of Castile in order to block the Dutch (enemies of Castile) from the lucrative spice found there. The alliance between Belgian and merchants was strengthened with the approach and encouragement of the Jewish community of Amsterdam. Short time after its creation, the company would set forth to the conquest of the Portuguese America and begin a new cycle in the colonial history of the Americas. Formada em 1621, a Companhia das Índias Ocidentais (CIO), foi a empresa responsável pela ocupação no nordeste açucareiro. Contando com investimentos mistos, a empresa teria sido idealizada por calvinistas que fugiram da Bélgica em virtude das perseguições religiosas ocorridas naquele país. Em Amsterdã, capital da província da Holanda, tais calvinistas associaram-se a mercadores que desejavam fazer o comércio das especiarias no Novo Mundo. Desde 1599, no contexto da União Ibérica, os portos da região açucareira foram fechados pela Coroa de Castela com o intuito de vedar o acesso dos neerlandeses (inimigos de Castela) à lucrativa especiaria encontrada ali. A aliança dada entre belgas e mercadores foi fortalecida com a aproximação e incentivo da comunidade judaica de Amsterdã. Em pouco tempo de criação, a empresa partiria para a conquista da América Portuguesa, e iniciaria um novo ciclo na história colonial das Américas...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThere {{has been a}} tremendous growth in the open-end <b>investment</b> <b>company</b> industry in current years. Its total net assets currently approximate $ 30 billion, and its activities account for nearly six percent of the overall trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The management {{of the companies that}} constitute this industry is therefore a subject which should be of considerable interest to the three million people who are shareholders in these companies. This subject is investigated by concentrating on four primary areas of interest: (1) management and supervision of the <b>investment</b> <b>company</b> portfolio by the <b>investment</b> <b>company</b> adviser, (2) the relationship of <b>investment</b> <b>company</b> size to the management fee paid the investment adviser, (3) the relationship of <b>investment</b> <b>company</b> size to the operating expenses of the company (exclusive of management fees) and, (4) the relationship of <b>investment</b> <b>company</b> performance to the management fee paid the investment adviser.

40|$|Mutual {{funds and}} other {{regulated}} <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> currently occupy a central space in American households’ financial lives. Is {{spite of their}} near-ubiquity, though, regulated <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> occupy a strange tax limbo as quasi-pass-through entities, neither fully taxable nor fully tax-transparent. To qualify for this quasi-pass-through status, regulated <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> must, among other things, distribute {{the bulk of their}} income to shareholders annually. The distribution requirement imposes costs on both regulated <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> and on their shareholders. It is commonly framed as an attempt to make the economics of investing in regulated <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> similar to the economics of making direct portfolio investments. History shows, though, that the distribution requirement finds its basis in marketing, and not in any tax policy consideration. If the distribution requirement benefited the shareholders, or benefitted the government, it would be worth the costs it imposes. But this article concludes that the complexity and expense are not. When tax policymakers discard their flawed premise of attempting to replicate the tax treatment of direct portfolio investment, they can stop clumsily and partially attempting to recreate true pass-through taxation for regulated <b>investment</b> <b>companies.</b> Instead, they can reframe regulated <b>investment</b> <b>company</b> taxation in a way that imposes a single level of taxation while, at the same time, protects regulated <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> from being transformed into a vehicle for tax deferral. In this Article, I evaluate several ways the tax law could tax regulated <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> and their shareholders while imposing only a single level of taxation and ensuring that shareholders have the liquidity with which to pay taxes. Ultimately, I find that the best model would defer exempt regulated <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> from taxation. At the same time, it would defer taxing shareholders until they realized income or gain. It would make up for that deferral by imposing an interest charge on the gain. For shareholders who wanted to avoid this interest regime, it would also allow for a mark-to-market election...|$|R
