5|$|After World War II, {{a debate}} about whether a country should {{introduce}} financial planning to develop itself or rely on private entrepreneurs emerged. Nurkse believed that the subject of who should promote development does not concern economists. It is an administrative problem. The crucial idea was that {{a large amount of}} well dispersed investment should be made in the economy, so that the market size expands and leads to higher productivity levels, increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question. However, {{it should be noted that}} <b>most</b> <b>economists</b> who favoured the balanced growth hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates. Further, the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake such high risks.|$|E

25|$|A tax {{effectively}} changes relative {{prices of}} products. Therefore, <b>most</b> <b>economists,</b> especially neoclassical economists, argue that taxation creates market distortion {{and results in}} economic inefficiency unless there are (positive or negative) externalities associated with the activities that are taxed {{that need to be}} internalized to reach an efficient market outcome. They have therefore sought to identify the kind of tax system that would minimize this distortion.|$|E

25|$|The {{provisions}} of the AUSFTA in Ch 17 required Australia to offer stronger protection to American intellectual property. In particular, the minimum term of copyright was extended to 70 years after the author's death. <b>Most</b> <b>economists</b> and others interested in intellectual property issues regarded this as undesirable.

25|$|Property {{analysis}} company CoreLogic says 45% {{of house}} purchases in New Zealand are now made by investors who already own a home, while another 28% {{are made by}} people moving from one property to another.

25|$|Health {{insurance}} benefits are an attractive way for employers {{to increase the}} salary of employees as they are nontaxable. As a result, 65% of the non-elderly population and over 90% of the privately insured non-elderly population receives health insurance at the workplace. Additionally, <b>most</b> <b>economists</b> agree that this tax shelter increases individual demand for health insurance, leading some to claim that it is {{largely responsible for the}} rise in health care spending.|$|E

25|$|Economist Paul A. Samuelson {{wrote in}} 1964 that <b>most</b> <b>economists</b> believe that {{economic}} conclusions reached by pure logical deduction are limited and weak. According to Samuelson and economist Bryan Caplan, Mises' deductive methodology also embraced by Murray Rothbard {{and to a}} lesser extent by Mises' student, Israel Kirzner was not sufficient in and of itself. Bryan Caplan wrote that the Austrian challenge to the realism of neoclassical assumptions helped work towards making those assumptions more plausible.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{of living in the}} United States is high by the standards that <b>most</b> <b>economists</b> use, and for many decades throughout the 20th century, the United States was recognized as having the highest {{standard of}} living in the world. Per capita income is high but also less evenly distributed than in most other developed countries; as a result, the United States fares particularly well in measures of average material well being that do not place weight on equality aspects.|$|E
25|$|Malthus {{convinced}} <b>most</b> <b>economists</b> {{that even}} while high fertility might increase the gross output, it tended to reduce output per capita. David Ricardo and Alfred Marshall admired Malthus, and so came under his influence. Early converts to his population theory included William Paley. Despite Malthus's opposition to contraception, his work exercised {{a strong influence}} on Francis Place (1771–1854), whose neo-Malthusian movement became the first to advocate contraception. Place published his Illustrations and Proofs of the Principles of Population in 1822.|$|E

Though <b>most</b> <b>economists</b> agree {{that it is difficult to}} assess the direct impact of the NAALC, it is agreed that there has been a convergence of labor standards in North America.

25|$|While {{the credit}} rating of India {{was hit by}} its nuclear weapons tests in 1998, it has since been raised to {{investment}} level in 2003 by Standard & Poor's (S) and Moody's. India experienced high growth rates, averaging 9% from 2003 to 2007. Growth then moderated in 2008 due to the global financial crisis. In 2003, Goldman Sachs predicted that India's GDP in current prices would overtake France and Italy by 2020, Germany, UK and Russia by 2025 and Japan by 2035, making it the third-largest economy of the world, behind the US and China.

25|$|Even before {{becoming}} {{a president of the}} American Economic Association, Galbraith was considered as an iconoclast by many economists. This is partly because he rejected the technical analysis and mathematical modelling of neoclassical economics as being divorced from reality. Following Thorstein Veblen, he believed that economic activity could not be distilled into inviolable laws, but rather was a complex product of the cultural and political milieu in which it occurs. In particular, he posited that important factors, such as the separation between corporate ownership and management, oligopoly, and the influence of government and military spending had been largely neglected by <b>most</b> <b>economists</b> because they are not amenable to axiomatic descriptions. In this sense, he worked as much in political economy as in classical economics.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{consensus}} among economists regarding the motive force for the U.S. economic expansion that continued {{through most of the}} Roosevelt years (and the 1937 recession that interrupted it). The common view among <b>most</b> <b>economists</b> is that Roosevelt's New Deal policies either caused or accelerated the recovery, although his policies were never aggressive enough to bring the economy completely out of recession. Some economists have also called attention to the positive effects from expectations of reflation and rising nominal interest rates that Roosevelt's words and actions portended. It was the rollback of those same reflationary policies that led to the interrupting recession of 1937. One contributing policy that reversed reflation was the Banking Act of 1935, which effectively raised reserve requirements, causing a monetary contraction that helped to thwart the recovery. GDP returned to its upward trend in 1938.|$|E
25|$|On 11 November, Callaghan {{gave his}} first budget and {{announced}} increases in income tax, petrol tax {{and the introduction}} of a new capital gains tax, actions which <b>most</b> <b>economists</b> deemed necessary to take the heat out of the balance and sterling deficit. The budget also contained measures to increase the state pension, a measure which was disliked by the City and speculators, causing a run on the pound. On 23 November, it was decided to increase the bank rate from 2% to 7% which generated a large amount of criticism. Handling the crisis was made more difficult by the attitude of Lord Cromer, the Governor of the Bank of England, who argued against the fiscal policies of the new Labour government. When Callaghan and Wilson threatened to call a new general election, the governor soon raised a £3billion loan to stabilise the reserves and the deficit.|$|E
500|$|A {{survey of}} {{economic}} {{literature on the}} subject, however, finds that <b>most</b> <b>economists</b> agree {{that some form of}} road pricing to reduce congestion is economically viable, although there is disagreement on what form road pricing should take. Economists disagree over how to set tolls, how to cover common costs, what to do with any excess revenues, whether and how [...] "losers" [...] from tolling previously free roads should be compensated, and whether to privatize highways. Also, concerns regarding fossil fuel supply and urban transport high emissions of greenhouse gases in the context of climate change have renewed interest in congestion pricing, as it {{is considered one of the}} demand-side mechanisms that may reduce oil consumption.|$|E

500|$|When Menem {{began his}} presidency, there was massive {{hyperinflation}} and a recession. <b>Most</b> <b>economists</b> {{of the time}} thought that the ideal solution was the Washington Consensus: reduce expenditures below {{the amount of money}} earned by the state, and open [...] international commerce to free trade. Alfonsín had proposed similar plans in the past, alongside some privatization; but those projects were resisted by the PJ. The plan was resisted by factions benefiting from the protectionist policies, but the magnitude of the crisis convinced most politicians to change their minds. Menem, fearing that the crisis might force him to resign as well, embraced the Washington Consensus and rejected the traditional policies of Peronism. He invited the conservative politicians Álvaro Alsogaray and María Julia Alsogaray into his cabinet, as well as businessmen from Bunge and Born.|$|E
500|$|The Economists Free Exchange blog {{argued that}} Cowen [...] "undersold" [...] recent {{innovations}} in digital technologies and that society {{was still in}} the process of re-organising itself around them. A growth spurt should be expected but this could take anything from years to decades, it warned. Furthermore, there are particularly large gains to be had in the area [...] "cognition-augmenting innovations (as opposed to labor-augmenting innovations)". Writing in Forbes, Steve Denning described Cowen's [...] "low-hanging fruit theory" [...] as [...] "folkloric nonsense". The world of 1953, when Denning was young, is inconceivable to a young person today, he wrote, adding that the qualification [...] "apart from the Internet" [...] is equivalent to saying [...] "apart from the wheel" [...] when discussing transport. The Financial Times reviewer recognized that Cowen, a prominent blogger, [...] "is no Luddite...he thinks life is more fun and interesting with the internet around". He argued that <b>most</b> <b>economists</b> do not look at consumer technology to find the internet's effect on productivity but rather organizations: super-efficient retailers such as Wal-mart and Tesco have already incorporated it into their logistics. Furthermore, the pace of change means it could be a generation at least before we see the full implementation. Timothy Noah seizes upon Cowen's [...] "concession" [...] that the internet could well increase scientific output by allowing better communication between scientists in remote places. Just as Davis and Wessel incorrectly predicted a coming boom in middle class incomes due to computers, Cowen [...] "seems equally wrong to suggest that computer technology is not on the verge of doing so." ...|$|E
