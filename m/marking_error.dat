40|$|One way {{to manage}} <b>marking</b> <b>error,</b> in a {{large-scale}} educational testing context, {{is to establish}} a mechanism through which appeals can be lodged. While, at one level, this seems to offer a straight-forward technical {{solution to the problem of}} <b>marking</b> <b>error,</b> it can also result in unintended consequences, with political, social or educational ramifications. It is therefore important to monitor the operation of any appeal system, to determine how effectively it meets its objectives. The present paper was based on an evaluation of the system which operates for National Curriculum testing in England. Four underlying objectives were identified: the measurement objective, the political objective, the educational objective and the psychological objective. Although there is reason to believe that such goals can be achieved through appeal systems, there are major threats to achieving them, many of which appear to be inevitable. These threats are examined within the paper and implications for policy and practice are explored...|$|E

After identifying the error patterns, this study attempts to analyze various {{sources of the}} learners' errors. The {{results of this study}} reveal the sources of the learners' errors to be complex and multi-faceted. Through analyzing the sources of the case <b>marking</b> <b>errors</b> of transitive predicates in learning Korean, the study confirms that three main factors that significantly affect the learners' grammatical errors;(a) Learners' grammatical knowledge and skill problem, (b) learners' motivational problems on learning the grammar rule, and (c) Induced problems. The results also reveal that these three factors are not separate problems but interconnected to each other as sources of case <b>marking</b> <b>errors</b> of transitive predicates. In addition, results suggest that Korean researchers and instructors should consider these problems and help learners identify the meanings realized by a specific grammatical feature, discover a rule and construct value and motivation on using correct case makers on their academic writing through providing effective teaching methods and teacher feedback...|$|R

In analyzing the grammatical errors, the writer used the theory proposed by Dulay et al.

The research subject of this study consisted of 42 students. The writer used secondary data source because in collecting the data the writer did not collect them by herself. The result of the study showed that there were 349 errors made by them. Most of the area of grammatical errors they made was omission errors. The second rank was misformation errors which are consisted of three; those are regularization, archi-form, and alternating forms. And all of the students’ errors in misformation errors were alternating forms. Then, the third rank was addition errors which are also consisted of three: regularization errors, simple addition <b>errors,</b> and double <b>marking</b> <b>errors.</b> However, there was no double <b>marking</b> <b>errors</b> in students’ composition.

The data is obtained from ICNALE (Ishikawa, 2013) corpus, a corpus of English learners in Asia. I focus the extraction on the Indonesian data. The sample for this model is obtained from English texts written by proficient Indonesian students. The data is processed by a Local Grammar (LG) based corpus processing software called UNITEX (Paumier, 2008). The experiment begins with error identification. Parts of the texts where errors take place are <b>marked</b> with <b>error</b> tags. The suggested forms to revise the errors are written in Local Grammar Graphs (LGGs) that are applicable to the corpus text. When these LGGs are applied in the corpus, they retrieve parts of the texts that are <b>marked</b> by the <b>error</b> tags and the suggested forms embedded in the LGGs. Users are provided with the options to display concordance in several ways. First, it may identify parts of the texts that are <b>marked</b> by <b>error</b> tags.

We investigate whether complex utterances in the input (Let me do it) might explain the origin of these errors. Longitudinal naturalistic data from seventeen English-speaking two- to four-year-olds was searched for 1 psg accusative-for-nominative case errors and for all 1 psg preverbal pronominal contexts. Their caregivers’ data was also searched for 1 psg preverbal pronominal contexts. The data show that the children’s proportional use of me-for-I errors correlated with their caregivers’ proportional use of me in 1 psg preverbal contexts. Furthermore, the verbs that children produced in me-error utterances appeared in complex sentences containing me in the input more often than verbs that did not appear in me-for-I errors in the children’s speech.

40|$|How {{to respond}} to errors in student writing has long {{represented}} a topic of controversy in second language writing research. While some scholars have argued that error treatment does not contribute to accuracy in student writing and may, in fact, impede second language acquisition (i. e. Krashen, 1982; Truscott, 2007 2 ̆ 6 2008), many empirical studies have found {{evidence in support of}} it (i. e. Lalande, 1982; Robb, Ross, 2 ̆ 6 Shortreed, 1986; Fatham 2 ̆ 6 Whalley, 1990; Ashwell, 2000; Ferris 2 ̆ 6 Roberts, 2001; Chandler, 2003; Sheen, 2007; Bitchener 2 ̆ 6 Knoch, 2009 a 2 ̆ 6 2009 b; Van Beuningen, De Jong, 2 ̆ 6 Kuiken; 2009). ^ Among those scholars who do believe that error treatment is effective, most advocate that instructors take a selective approach to <b>marking</b> <b>errors</b> (i. e. Bates, Lane, 2 ̆ 6 Lange, 1993; Ferris 2 ̆ 6 Hedgcock, 2005; Ellis, Sheen, Murakami, and Takashima, 2008; Lee, 2011). That is, rather than <b>mark</b> every <b>error</b> that occurs in a student text, instructors should mark only those that most impede understanding. The benefits of such an approach are that it saves an instructor time, allows students to see patterns in their errors, and facilitates independent editing skills. However, because advice from literature regarding which and how many <b>errors</b> to <b>mark</b> can be nebulous and even contradictory, some instructors can have difficulty implementing a selective approach. In addition, surveys of student attitudes toward error treatment found that they overwhelmingly prefer that <b>errors</b> are <b>marked</b> comprehensively (i. e. Leki, 1991 b; Oladejo, 1993; Lee, 2005). ^ The purpose of this qualitative study was therefore to investigate (1) to what extent instructors of second language writing <b>marked</b> <b>errors</b> in student work and why and (2) student attitudes toward selective and comprehensive error treatment. The participants included three instructors and 19 students of First Year Composition of International Students at Purdue University. Interviews revealed that the three instructor participants each differed in how much feedback they provide, but that their approaches were flexible and context-dependent. Reflecting previous studies, the student participants in this investigation also preferred comprehensive error treatment but reported being satisfied with the approach of an instructor who used a selective approach. Additional findings show that there are discrepancies in how instructors and students of the same class describe the instructor 2 ̆ 7 s approach to error treatment and that students rely overwhelmingly on instructor feedback when editing. Pedagogical implications are included. ...|$|R

This paper applies a range of methods to census, registration and survey data for Guatemala for the period from 1981 to 1994.

Methods using intercensal survival perform very poorly, giving rise to results {{that are hard to}} interpret. Methods using the distribution of deaths by age and rates of change of the population by age appear to work better, but still give rise to substantially different results. Simulations suggest that a combination of two methods appears to work well.

A new method for analyzing intercensal changes in cohort proportions with surviving mother, presented in the paper, gives results broadly consistent with estimates based on adjusted registered deaths. ...|$|R

Method: Twenty-two 3 -year-olds participated in a picture description task. The percentage of grammatical utterances was computed and error types were analyzed.

The current study revealed a variety of error types produced by 3 -year-olds, most of which were produced by fewer than 5 children.
