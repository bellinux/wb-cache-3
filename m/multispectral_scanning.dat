From a few color patches arranged on a small strip, camera responses are completely obtained by a line scan imaging system without having to move the color strip under the camera by means of a conveyor; these responses are used to derive corresponding reflectance spectra [1, 2].

Due to its high spatial resolution and extended water penetration, coastal light detection and ranging (LiDAR), coupled with <b>multispectral</b> <b>scanning</b> (MSS), has great promise for resolving disturbed shoreline features in low turbidity environments. Migrating mine tailings present serious issues for Lake Superior and coastal marine environments. Previous investigations in Lake Superior uncovered a metal-rich “halo ” around the Keweenaw Peninsula, related to past copper mining practices.

40|$|A {{vegetative}} canopy model {{concept is}} developed {{and used to}} calculate the directional spectral reflectance of a corn field under stress. The problem has been idealized by assuming that the canopy is represented in several layers of uniform but randomly distributed biological components; horizontal and vertical projection of leaves, for example, replaces the actual leaf. An accumulative horizontal projection leads to a quantitative horizontal leaf area index while accumulated vertical projections provide the vertical leaf index area for each layer. The spectral properties of the projections are obtained from the spectral properties of the biological components. These techniques together with soil reflectance data provide a physical description for the vegetative canopy and adequately interprete <b>multispectral</b> <b>scanning</b> data...|$|E

30|$|The use {{of camera}} systems to inspect printed {{materials}} is ubiquitous. More and more manufacturers are adopting optical solutions, since such solutions allow a seamless monitoring of print jobs at high production speeds and ensure a reliable detection of defects. Imaging systems that {{consist of a}} camera and a light source, and that provide accurate measurements, are a prerequisite for these purposes. Often <b>multispectral</b> line <b>scan</b> cameras are used, since they combine spectral color measurements with high speed inspection of continuous materials (as, for example, printed web). To ensure a sufficient quality of the measurements of such imaging systems, a simple method is to stop the production process {{from time to time}} to check the camera and the applied light source. To this end, a suitable color chart can be integrated into the production line and is scanned by the camera. For this purpose, the color chart has to be conveyed under the camera. A comparison between the recorded camera responses and reference camera responses indicates whether the imaging system has to be recalibrated. However, this procedure is time-consuming and its implementation is technically complicated when considering line scan applications.|$|R

The multispectral method indicates subsidence areas by vegetation, soil colour and temperature variations. Computer enhancement of the multispectral images allow some subsidence details not seen by conventional photography to be delineated. The MSS images are two-dimensional and even the most detailed ones have a fairly coarse resolution (1. 5 – 2. 0 m). Because of this, conventional 3 D interpretation of stereo air photographs better indicates the morphology of the subsidence hollows and the geology. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstruct- To segment brain tissues in {{magnetic}} resonance {{images of the}} brain, we have implemented a stochastic re-laxation method which utilizes partial volume analysis for ev-ery brain voxel, and operates on fully three-dimensional (3 -D) data. However, there are still problems with automatically or semi-automatically segmenting thick {{magnetic resonance}} (MR) slices, particularly when trying to segment the small lesions present in MR images of multiple sclerosis patients. To im-prove lesion segmentation we have extended our method of stochastic relaxation by both pre- and post-processing the MR images. The preprocessing step involves image enhancement using homomorphic filtering to correct for nonhomogeneities in the coil and magnet. Because approximately 95 % of all multiple sclerosis lesions occur in the white matter of the brain, the post-processing step involves application of morphological processing and thresholding techniques to the intermediate segmentation {{in order to develop}} a mask image containing only white matter and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesion. This whiteAesion masked image is then segmented by again applying our stochastic relaxation technique.

40|$|Airborne laser {{scanning}} (ALS) {{is the one}} of the most accurate remote sensing techniques for data acquisition where the terrain and its coverage is concerned. Modern scanners have been able to scan in two or more channels (frequencies of the laser) recently. This gives the rise to the possibility of obtaining diverse information about an area with the different spectral properties of objects. The paper presents an example of a multispectral ALS system - Titan by Optech - with the possibility of data including the analysis of digital elevation models accuracy and data density. As a result of the study, the high relative accuracy of LiDAR acquisition in three spectral bands was proven. The mean differences between digital terrain models (DTMs) were less than 0. 03 m. The data density analysis showed the influence of the laser wavelength. The points clouds that were tested had average densities of 25, 23 and 20 points per square metre respectively for green (G), near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) lasers.
