50|$|<b>Medicinal</b> <b>teas</b> in Dominica can {{be traced}} to the {{original}} indigenous Carib inhabitants and to the African slaves who were brought to the islands. The Caribs traditionally made a tea from the leaves of the periwinkle plant (Catharanthus roseus) for use as a treatment for diabetes. Pharmacological companies today extract several medicinal alkaloids from periwinkle sap. The alkaloids derived from this plant include the anti-cancer agents vinblastine and vincristine. Other extracts from periwinkle help lower blood sugar in diabetics and are the basis for powerful tranquilizers. The powerful qualities of this plant were known to other cultures; it is known by the name Violette de Sorcier (Sorcerer's Violet) in France.|$|R

Echinacea {{is used as a}} <b>medicinal</b> <b>tea.</b> The wormwood genus Artemisia includes absinthe (A. absinthium) and tarragon (A. dracunculus).

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the use of {{complementary}} and alternative medicine (CAM) in cancer patients across a number of European countries. Methods: A descriptive survey design was developed. Fourteen countries participated in the study and data was collected through a descriptive questionnaire from 956 patients. Results: Data suggest that CAM is popular among cancer patients with 35. 9 % using some form of CAM (range among countries 14. 8 % to 73. 1 %). A heterogeneous group of 58 therapies were ident-ified as being used. Herbal medicines and remedies were the most commonly used CAM therapies, together with homeopathy, vitamins/minerals, <b>medicinal</b> <b>teas,</b> spiritual therapies and relaxation tech-niques. Herbal medicine use tripled from use before diagnosis to use since diagnosis with cancer...|$|R

5000|$|At {{the start}} of the leg, teams were told they were to head next to the capital city of Beijing. On arrival, they had to head to the Liangzi Foot Massage Palace at Jianguomen to find their next clue: the Roadblock, where teams asked [...] "Who's feeling manipulative?". One team member had to drink a cup of Chinese <b>medicinal</b> <b>tea,</b> then endure a {{traditional}} therapeutic foot massage for ten minutes. After the massage and another cup of tea, they received their next clue. In case teams were unable to bear the painful part of the massage, they would tap one side of their chair and say [...] "uncle" [...] to signal the masseuse to stop. Doing so, however, meant restarting the massage from the beginning.|$|E
50|$|The resin is {{also used}} as a {{treatment}} for gout, while the leaves are brewed into a <b>medicinal</b> <b>tea.</b> Hexane extracts of the leaves have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties in animal tests. Gumbo-limbo bark is also considered an antidote to Metopium toxiferum, also known as chechen tree, which often grows in the same habitat and can cause extreme rashes just as the related poison ivy. Given the eagerness with which some birds seek out the arils, it may be that they contain lipids or other compounds useful to humans; in order for these to be exploited, however, they would probably have to be synthetically produced, because although the crop of a single tree can be very large (up to or even exceeding 15,000 fruits, translating into a raw lipid yield of over 200 grams per harvest), individual seeds are small and cumbersome to harvest.|$|E
