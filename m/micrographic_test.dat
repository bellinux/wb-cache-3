Also a set of variables including drill solids content (2 %- 6 %), hydrochloric acid concentration (2 %- 10 %), and temperature (110 ?F- 160 ?F) were changed during the testing procedure. A matrix design was used to determine the behavior in regain permeability and break through time depending on the different variables in the testing, and two devices were used to measure responses, Conoco cell and ceramic disc cell respectively. Results have shown that regain permeability and break through time responses are not affected in a greater degree when lubricants (Idlube or Mil-Lube) are added to the DIF systems (SS and SCC). When comparing results between lubricants, Idlube gives a higher regain permeability percentage and faster break through time at higher concentrations than Mil-Lube in both DIF systems.

This thesis presents a fracture mechanics approach to ranking polymers and predicting lifetimes for long-term, brittle-like failures by studying slow crack growth (SCG) rate as a function of stress intensity. Constant load single-edge-notch bend (SENB) tests commonly know as ''three point bend'' tests have been performed on deeply notched specimens. The load-line displacement as a function of time was measured. The material compliance was calculated and used to determine the crack growth rate (da/dt) as a function of stress intensity (K?). Very good repeatability was demonstrated and da/dt was found to be a unique function of K? giving the some crack growth rate at a particular K? for very different combinations of load and initial crack length (a[]). It was demonstrated that da/dt vs. K? curve comparisons can be used to rank a material's resistance to slow crack growth. A set of da/dt =AK[] data was combined with a single Stage II hydrostatic rupture test point to predict the entire Stage II failure curve. This research also characterized the effects of Igepal on the total times to failure, crack initiation times, crack growth times, and da/dt vs. K? curves of two HDPE materials.

Cyclones were tested as fine dust collectors, simultaneous fine dust/trash collectors, and in series with a baffle-type pre-collector placed upstream of the cyclone. Cotton gin trash was utilized as the trash component while corn dust, sieved to less than 100 []m Aerodynamic Equivalent Diameter (AED), was utilized as the fine dust component. Results indicated that cyclones, if designed and operated properly as fine dust collectors, can be utilized as particulate abatement devices in situations where filtration technology is perceived as the only suitable solution. Emission concentrations below 23 mg/m 3 (0. 01 gr/dscf) were achieved using the ID- 3 D cyclones. It was shown that the ID- 3 D cyclone will have lower emission concentrations as compared to the 2 D- 2 D cyclone at similar loading conditions. Tests showed that using ID- 3 D and 2 D- 2 D cyclones to simultaneously collect trash and fine dust will result in significantly higher emission concentrations as compared to emissions from cyclones collecting only fine dust. Significant reductions in emissions can be achieved if a baffle-type pre-collector is utilized to remove trash particles prior to cyclone fine dust removal. Utilizing the baffle-type pre-collector resulted in lower cyclone en-fission concentrations than when the cyclones were used to collect only fine dust.

Two simulated drill solids, clay or 75 -[]m reservoir sand were added as drill solids to these DIF 's. Poroplus[] metallic screens developed by Purolator Products Company were used to simulate the sand control device. The DIF's tested included a sized-calcium carbonate (SCC) and a sized-salt (SS). Drill solids added to the tested DIF's simulate tiny formation particles. The presence of these drill solids was found to affect the particle size distribution as well as the mean size (D[]) of the particles of the bridging and weighting material (BWM) and loss control material (LCM) that make up a fundamental part of the DIF's. BWM solids containing calcium montmorillonite clay showed that the median size of the particles was substantially decreased and the ultrafine material content (particles smaller than 45 []m) was increased. BWM solids containing 75 -[]m sand as drill solids showed an increase of the median size of the particles with a decrease in the ultrafine material. After the filtercake clean-up treatment and subsequent backsaw, screen plugging evaluated in terms of regained-flow capacity was much more severe {{in the presence of the}} whole altercate (after 3 % KCl treatments) than in the presence of the degraded filtercake (after HCI acid treatments). On the basis of the previous observations, it can be concluded that when SCC filtercakes were backflowed, the smaller the particle size of the altercate, the higher the minimum dislodging pressure (MDP) and screen plugging, and consequently the lower the regained-flow capacity. Coarse particle size of the filtercakes tended to result in minimum MDP, leading to higher regained-flow capacity and lower plugging of the screen. In contrast, these effects in SS filtercakes were masked by the presence of a polymer, xanthin gum, in the filtercake. The polymers act as glue on the sized particles forming a strong, tough, and rigid filtercake. Therefore, these filtercakes required high pressure to be backfired, decreasing the regained-flow capacity highly and causing severe plugging of the screens. Also, the results indicated that the hydrochloric acid treatment was more effective in removing the filtercakes than the 3 % KCI treatment. Also, it was demonstrated that the use of HCI is much more effective in removing the filtercake formed by SS than in removing the one formed by SCC...|$|R

Experiments using 12 M 2 artificial plots indicated that habitat use by fishes increased with increased patch size, regardless of patch structure. Increasing shoot density and leaves per shoot had little effect on habitat use by fishes, regardless of patch structure.

Laboratory data indicated that toxic baits, as well as control and regular laboratory diet, elicited similar recruitment rates in all the tested species. Further, there was no significant difference in the amount removed in 24 hours for any of the chemical baits. Evaluation of bait effects on worker mortality, egg production, and brood ranking for a period of two months indicated detrimental effects of all the toxic baits against the two non-target species.

However, explicit finite element analysis is rapidly becoming a feasible alternative and offers several advantages to the designer. Over the past ten years, FHWA has supported research involving use of the explicit code LS-DYNA 3 D for analytical simulation of vehicular impacts of roadside safety systems. Consequently, the goals of this research were the development of a finite element model of the TxDOT T 6 bridge rail system using LS-DYNA 3 D and validation of simulation results against recorded data from full-scale crash testing. The process of modeling the T 6 system was a conglomeration of efforts to accurately represent the various components and approximations to reduce the required computational time. When feasible, material testing was conducted to obtain input values for material definitions. The focus of the research approach was to validate subsystem models, primarily the post-base-weld assembly, against TTI test data prior to assembling the entire T 6 model. Sections of the T 6 installation located outside the impact region and various connections were represented using approximate modeling techniques. Because no test data existed, explicit models of these components were created solely to calibrate simplified models. Also, most initial simulations utilized rigid impactors to evaluate the response of the finite element models. To evaluate the accuracy of the T 6 model, a 2000 -kg truck model was obtained from the National Crash Analysis Center (NCAC). Impact conditions of the final simulation were based on TTI full-scale crash test 418048 - 03. Simulation results were compared both qualitatively and quantitatively with recorded data from a full-scale crash test conducted by TTI. Evaluation criteria, such as the overhead vehicle trajectory, deformation of the vehicle and the T 6 system, transverse deflections, and the velocity time history of the vehicle, correlated well. However, the exit angle and amount of rolling experienced by the vehicle did not reflect results of the experimental test.

The composites featured a porous continuous ceramic-preform network infiltrated by a liquid metal {{to form the}} final consolidated composite. The liquid metal phase was pure copper. Six different ceramic preform variants were tested. Ceramic volume fractions of 40, 50 and 60 % were used, of two preform types; one pure-alumina, and one with additional 2 wt% copper(I) oxide (CU 20), functioning as an infiltration aid, the effects of which were determined in a previous study; the copper-oxide reduced infiltration pressure and allowed the use of higher ceramic phase volume fraction in the final composite. Abrasive wear tests against two automotive braking system materials were conducted. Grey cast iron of alloy type GG 15 was used to establish a baseline for behaviour of the six different composite samples and compare them. Following this, the three volume fraction variants of samples using the copper-oxide infiltration aid were trialled against a commercially-available European passenger vehicle brake pad friction material; ABEX 6091. Wear tests were conducted on a pin-on-disc tribometer. Hemispherical-headed pins were made from the composite and tested against rotating discs of the grey cast iron and the ABEX friction material. Contact velocity was kept constant at Ims-¹ at room temperature in air, and contact loads up to 15 N were used. Test loads of 1 - 4 N were used against grey cast iron, and 15 N against the ABEX friction material. Optical micrography was used to monitor the wear rate of samples tested against grey cast iron. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterise bulk microstructures and evaluate surface wear features. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used for further microstructural investigation of the sintering and interfacial features of the undamaged pin samples, as well as damage zones and tribofilm compositions. Focussed ion beam (FIB) milling was used to create subsurface cross-sections of wear regions and prepare TEM samples. The wear performance of the different sample types was compared by ceramic content and preform additives. It {{was found that the}} wear resistance of pure-alumina preform composites was dependent on ceramic volume fraction. Increasing ceramic content lead to increased wear resistance. The lower sinter temperature of the samples with the copper oxide additive led to reduced wear resistance compared with the monolithic alumina preforms and changes in ceramic volume fractions were not discernable in wear resistance against grey cast iron. This could be further supported by qualitative <b>micrographic</b> observations. All <b>tests</b> against grey cast iron were dominated by tribochemical film formation, which was determined to be oxidation of the iron which formed at the composite pin contact surface. Further testing of the copper-oxide containing samples against the ABEX friction material revealed a mixed result; the 50 and 60 % ceramic volume samples produced near-identical wear performance, while the 40 % sample suffered poor wear resistance. The dominant wear mechanism of composite pins tested against the ABEX friction material was abrasive wear. Sub-surface analysis of wear pins revealed a prominent damage layer forming at the contact surface of all pin samples which progressively grew into the bulk material.
