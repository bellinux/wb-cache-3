Therefore the final {{evaporation to dryness}} was conducted under low temperature and high vacuum. Its chemical structure was elucidated by analytical LC-ToF-MS and NMR (1 H, 13 C, COSY, DEPT). The molecular mass of 135.061 was measured in the negative mode which was a good match with the <b>mono-isotopic</b> <b>mass</b> of 136.052, expected for 4 -VC. 1 H and 13 C-NMR data were identical to those described in literature ([...] [...]...|$|E
40|$|Tandem mass {{spectrometry}} (MS/MS) has been routinely {{used to identify}} peptides from protein mixtures {{in the field of}} proteomics. However, only about 30 % to 40 % of current MS/MS spectra can be identified, while many of them remain unassigned, even though they are of reasonable quality. The ubiquitous presence of post-translational modifications (PTMs) {{is one of the reasons}} for current low spectral identification rate. In order to identify post-translationally modified peptides, most existing software requires the specification of a few possible modifications. However, such knowledge of possible modifications is not always available. In this thesis, we describe a new algorithm for identifying modified peptides without requiring users to specify the possible modifications before the search routine; instead, all modifications from the Unimod database are considered. Meanwhile, several new techniques are employed to avoid the exponential growth of the search space, as well as to control the false discoveries due to this unrestricted search approach. A software tool, PeaksPTM, has been developed and it has already achieved a stronger performance than competitive tools for unrestricted identification of post-translationally modified peptides. Another important reason for the failure of the search tools is the inaccurate mass or charge state measurement of the precursor peptide ion. In this thesis, we study the precursor <b>mono-isotopic</b> <b>mass</b> and charge determination problem, and propose an algorithm to correct precursor ion mass error by assessing the isotopic features in its parent MS spectrum. The algorithm has been tested on two annotated data sets and achieved almost 100 percent accuracy. Furthermore, we have studied a more complicated problem, the MS/MS preprocessing problem, and propose a spectrum deconvolution algorithm. Experiments were provided to compare its performance with other existing software...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMaitotoxins (MTXs) {{are among}} the most potent toxins known. These toxins are {{produced}} by epi-benthic dinoflagellates of the genera Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa and {{may play a role in}} causing the symptoms associated with Ciguatera Fish Poisoning. A recent survey revealed that, of the species tested, the newly described species from the Canary Islands, G. excentricus, is one of the most maitotoxic. The goal of the present study was to characterize MTX-related compounds produced by this species. Initially, lysates of cells from two Canary Island G. excentricus strains VGO 791 and VGO 792 were partially purified by (i) liquid-liquid partitioning between dichloromethane and aqueous methanol followed by (ii) size-exclusion chromatography. Fractions from chromatographic separation were screened for MTX toxicity using both the neuroblastoma neuro- 2 a (N 2 a) cytotoxicity and Ca 2 + flux functional assays. Fractions containing MTX activity were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) to pinpoint potential MTX analogs. Subsequent non-targeted HRMS analysis permitted the identification of a novel MTX analog, maitotoxin- 4 (MTX 4, accurate <b>mono-isotopic</b> <b>mass</b> of 3292. 4860 Da, as free acid form) in the most toxic fractions. HRMS/MS spectra of MTX 4 as well as of MTX are presented. In addition, crude methanolic extracts of five other strains of G. excentricus and 37 other strains representing one Fukuyoa species and ten species, one ribotype and one undetermined strain/species of Gambierdiscus were screened for the presence of MTXs using low resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LRMS/MS). This targeted analysis indicated the original maitotoxin (MTX) was only present in one strain (G. australes S 080911 _ 1). Putative maitotoxin- 2 (p-MTX 2) and maitotoxin- 3 (p-MTX 3) were identified in several other species, but confirmation was not possible because of the lack of reference material. Maitotoxin- 4 was detected in all seven strains of G. excentricus examined, independently of their origin (Brazil, Canary Islands and Caribbean), and not detected in any other species. MTX 4 may therefore serve as a biomarker for the highly toxic G. excentricus in the Atlantic area...|$|E
40|$|Proteomic {{platforms}} can {{be classified}} in bottom-up strategies, which analyze the sample after proteolytic digestion, and top-down strategies, which analyze the intact naturally occurring proteome. Bottom-up platforms are high-throughput because they can investigate {{a large number of}} proteins, regardless of their dimension. Nonetheless, information on post-translational modifications (PTMs) can be lost, especially those regarding naturally occurring cleavages and alternative splicing. Top-down platforms cannot cover vast proteomes, however, they can disclose subtle structural variations occurring during protein maturation and allow label-free relative quantifications in an unlimited number of samples. A repertoire of 256 masses belonging to naturally occurring proteins and peptides consistently detected by RP-HPLC-ESI-MS analysis of the acidic soluble fraction of human whole saliva is presented in this study. Of them, 233 have been identified, while 23 are still pending for the definitive characterization. The present review reports average and <b>mono-isotopic</b> <b>masses</b> of the peptides and proteins detected, RP-HPLC elution times, PTMs, origin and quali-quantitative variations observed in several physiological and pathological conditions. The information reported can be a reference for users of top-down RP-HPLC-ESI-MS proteomic platforms applied {{to the study of the}} human salivary proteome as well as of other human bodily fluids...|$|R
50|$|Typically, peptide {{signals are}} {{detected}} at the MS1 level and distinguished from chemical noise through their characteristic isotopic pattern. These patterns are then tracked across the retention time dimension {{and used to}} reconstruct a chromatographic elution profile of the <b>mono-isotopic</b> peptide <b>mass.</b> The total ion current of the peptide signal is then integrated and used as a quantitative measurement of the original peptide concentration. For each detected peptide, all isotopic peaks are first found and the charge state is then assigned.|$|R
40|$|A {{range of}} “Herbal High ” {{products}} were tested for synthetic cannabinoids (cannabinomimetics) to qualitatively determine and compare their individual and relative content. Liquid chromatography–high resolution accurate mass spectrometry {{was used to}} rapidly screen samples {{for a range of}} cannabinomimetics using <b>mono-isotopic</b> <b>masses</b> derived from the elemental composition of target analytes. A screening database of over 140 compounds was rapidly created. This approach, combined with further tandem mass spectrometric experiments, also facilitated the detection and identification of compounds for which reference materials were not available. Previously reported cannabinomimetics, including JWH- 018 and CP 47, 497 and its homologues, were detected in varying relative proportions along with several tentatively identified unreported cannabinomimetics. In some countries, the decision has been made to include these substances within their drug control legislation, and other countries are considering similar action. The currently applied drug screening techniques are unlikely to be effective in providing scientific evidence to support their identification in seized products. The application of high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry offers a solution. In addition, the technology provides a relatively simple and quick method for screening products, building substance databases, and even identifying novel substances using a combination of accurate mass derived elemental composition and fragment ions combined with fragmentation prediction software...|$|R
40|$|Background: A Java™ {{application}} is presented, which compares large numbers (n > 100) of raw FTICR mass spectra from patients and controls. Two peptide profile matrices {{can be produced}} simultaneously, one with occurrences of peptide masses in samples and another with the intensity of common peak masses in all the measured samples, using the peak- and background intensities of the raw data. In latter way, more significantly differentially expressed peptides are found between groups than just using {{the presence or absence}} in samples of common peak masses. The software {{application is}} tested by searching angiogenesis related proteins in glioma by comparing laser capture micro dissected- and enzymatic by trypsin digested tissue sections. Results: By hierarchical clustering of the presence-absence matrix, it appears that proteins, such as hemoglobin alpha and delta subunit, fibrinogen beta and gamma chain precursor, tubulin specific chaperone A, epidermal fatty acid binding protein, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin precursor, peptidyl tRNA hydrolase 2 mitochondrial precursor, placenta specific growth hormone, and zinc finger CCHC domain containing protein 13 are significantly different expressed in glioma vessels. The up-regulated proteins in the glioma vessels with respect to the normal vessels determined by the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test on the intensity matrix are vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, serum albumin precursor, annexin A 5, alpha cardiac and beta actin, type I cytoskeletal 10 keratin, calcium binding protein p 22, and desmin. Peptide masses of calcium binding protein p 22, Cdc 42 effector protein 3, fibronectin precursor, and myosin- 9 are exclusively present in glioma vessels. Some peptide fragments of non-muscular myosin- 9 at the C-terminus are strongly up-regulated in the glioma vessels with respect to the normal vessels. Conclusion: The less rigorous than in general used commercial propriety software de-isotope algorithm results in more <b>mono-isotopic</b> peptide <b>masses</b> and consequently more proteins. Centroiding of peptide masses takes place by taking the average over more spectra in the profile matrix. Cytoskeleton proteins and proteins involved in the calcium signaling pathway seem to be most up-regulated in glioma vessels. The finding that peptides at the C-terminus of myosin- 9 are up-regulated could be ascribed to splicing or fragmentation by proteases...|$|R
