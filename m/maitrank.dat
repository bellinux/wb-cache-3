The name goes back to a story, according to which a wine adulterator had been changed into a cat as a punishment. Before it was shot by a hunter the cat {{was supposed to have}} been saved by revealing a recipe for a May Day drink (<b>Maitrank).</b> But because this drink was also adulterated and caused the hunter to have a hangover, the adulterator had to be saved again and now showed the hunter a hidden treasure. With this capital the hunter built the hotel as well as a monument to the adulterator.|$|E
