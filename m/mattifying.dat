5000|$|<b>Mattifying</b> gel, Poreless Face Defender, {{is often}} cited by Roncal as a {{signature}} item.|$|E
50|$|Water-based oil-free {{eliminates}} oil altogether, but substitutes an emollient ester or {{fatty alcohol}} in the base, and adds a <b>mattifying</b> agent — usually clay — to dry to a flat, non-reflective (“matte”) finish. Oil-free liquids are quite thick and heavy, and the earliest versions took time to pour out of the bottle. They provide solid medium coverage but dry quickly, and can thus set before blended is complete. The result is streaking, which is then difficult to smooth out without starting over from scratch. The usual recommendation is to divide the face into quarter sections, and to apply and blend the makeup over one section (rather than the entire face) at a time. Blending over moisturised skin with a wet sponge can also help compensate {{for the lack of}} slip. However, they will last a long time and resist smudging, even on very oily skin. Examples: Estee Lauder Fresh Air.|$|E
5000|$|Eyelid or {{eye shadow}} primers are similar, but made {{specifically}} for use near the eyes. An eyelid primer may help even {{the color of}} the lid and upper eye area, may reduce oiliness, may add shimmer, or inversely may <b>mattify.</b> Eye primers aid in the smooth application of eye shadow, prevent it from accumulating in eyelid creases, and improve its longevity. Eye shadow primers are applied to the eyelid and lower eye area prior to the application of eye shadow. They even out the skin tone of the eyelids hide eyelid veins, and smooth out the skin of the eyelids. Eye shadow primers help with the application of eye shadows. They intensify {{the color of the}} eye shadows and keep them from smearing or creasing by reducing the oiliness of the lids. The effect of eye shadow primers is not limited to eye shadows. They also work for eye liners and eye shadow bases.|$|R
