40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{centered}} on the experimental observation of electron-optics phenomena in graphene. In Chapter 2, graphene is introduced {{and the ability to}} form p-n junctions, with particular regard to electron optics experiments, is discussed. Since ballistic transport is crucial for this subject, the question “when is graphene clean?” is posed in Chapter 3, where different characterization methods are compared and linked to devices of this thesis. The experimental part begins with a description of the fabrication methods in Chapter 4, which is ‘spiced’ with information about complex device structures, superconducting contacts and the use of CVD-grown graphene. Chapter 5 describes an interference experiment over a distance of 2 μm, where we used p-n junctions to tune and manipulate ballistic Fabry-Pérot resonances. The peculiar angular dependence of the transmission allows to filter out large propagation angles. Thus, the p-n interface can be used to form coherent planar waves, i. e. it acts in this case similar to an optical polarization filter. This filtering effect is crucial for the high visibility of Fabry-Pérot resonances we achieved in p-n and p-n-p devices. A perpendicular magnetic {{can be viewed as a}} lense which bends and focuses electrons. Along a p-n interface, this leads to trajectories that curve back and forth. Such trajectories are called snake states and they give rise to magneto-conductance oscillations. In terms of optics, these oscillations occur since the focal point of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>lense</b> can be either on the left- or on the right side of the p-n cavity. We demonstrate the observation of snake states in Chapter 6. Furthermore, the p-n interface can be viewed as a mirror that is reflective or semitransparent, depending on the angle of incidence. By using such mirrors it is possible to create channels for electrons that are described in a similar way to optical waveguides. However, the refraction can be tuned dynamically and p-n interfaces can be exploited to create additional confinement. We use this to guide electrons in an electrostatic channel in Chapter 7 where we observe signatures of quasi 1 -dimensional transport. The thesis is complemented in Chapter 8 with a device that allows to explore the properties of a tilted p-n interface that acts as a beam-splitter...|$|E

40|$|We analyse several {{implications}} of lensing by the regular {{component of the}} galactic magnetic field upon the observed properties of ultra high energy cosmic rays. Magnetic fields deflect cosmic ray trajectories, causing flux (de) magnification, formation of multiple images of a single source, and time delays. We derive the energy dependence of these effects near the caustics at which the flux amplification of a point source diverges. We show that the large magnification of images around caustics leads to an amplification bias, which can make them dominate the flux in some energy ranges. We argue that clustering in the arrival directions of UHECRs of comparable energy {{may be due to}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>lensing</b> around caustics.

In particular, it is shown how the inclusion of drift effects in the transport diffusion equations leads naturally to an explanation for the knee, for the second knee and for the observed behavior of the composition and anisotropies between the knee and the ankle. It is shown that the trend towards a heavier composition above the knee has significant impact on the predicted neutrino fluxes above $ 10 ^{ 14 }$ eV.

The neutrinos continue their flight unaffected, as they rarely interact with matter. The number of muons was measured at this point, which gave an indication of the beam's profile and intensity. This beam then passed 732 km through the crust of the Earth and it is expected that during flight some of the muon neutrinos convert into other neutrino types such as tau neutrinos.

40|$|We {{discuss how}} <b>lensing</b> by <b>magnetic</b> fields in galaxy {{clusters}} affects ultrahigh energy cosmic ray (UHECR) observations. As specific example, we use Virgo {{together with the}} cluster magnetic fields obtained earlier in a constrained simulation of structure formation including MHD processes. We find that, if M 87 is the single source of UHECRs from Virgo, the emitted flux is strongly anisotropic in the most interesting energy range, (50 - 100) EeV, and differs from the average value by a factor five or more for a significant fraction of observers. Since <b>magnetic</b> <b>lensing</b> is energy dependent, the external energy spectrum as seen by different observers varies strongly too.

Modulation of guiding efficiency through gating is demonstrated and compared to numerical simulations, which indicates that interface roughness limits guiding performance, with few-nanometer effective roughness extracted.

40|$|The {{framework}} of this thesis is {{the investigation of}} the generation of proton beams using high-intensity laser pulses. Today's high power, ultrashort pulse laser systems are capable of achieving laser intensities up to 10 ^ 21 W/cm^ 2. When focused onto thin foil targets, extremely high field gradients of the order of TV/m are produced on the rear side of the target resulting in the acceleration of protons to multi-MeV energies with an exponential spectrum including up to 10 ^ 13 particles. This acceleration process, called Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA), generates high-current proton beams with characteristics that are superior to properties from conventional proton sources. In this work, an experimental method to fully reconstruct laser-accelerated proton beam parameters, called radiochromic film imaging spectroscopy (RIS), was developed. RIS allows for the characterization of proton beams concerning real and virtual source size, envelope- and microdivergence, normalized transverse emittance, phase space, and proton spectrum. Therefore, thin gold foils with a microgrooved rear side were manufactured and characterized. Calibrated GafChromic radiochromic films in stack configuration were used as spatial and energy resolved proton detector. The target rear side structure is transported by the beam, mapped into the detector and retains information about the beam. Since the proton beam expansion is a plasma expansion with accompanying electrons, a low-energy electron spectrometer was developed, built and tested to study the electron distribution matching to the proton beam energy distribution. Electrons in high-current proton beams have significant influence on beam neutralisation and space-charge effects. First experimental results show, that the observed electron spectrum is apparently not of the expected exponential shape, but more a peaked distribution around an avergage energy. Hence, it is not coupled to the proton spectrum, which argues for an adiabatic expansion of the electrons around the proton beam instead of co-moving electrons (v_e = v_p) with an exponential energy distribution. Two experiments were carried out at the VULCAN Petawatt laser with the aim of showing dynamic control and enhancement of proton acceleration using multiple or defocused laser pulses. Irradiating the target with a long pulse, low-intensity laser (10 ^ 12 W/cm^ 2) prior to the main pulse (ns), an optimum pre-plasma density scale length of 60 micrometer is generated leading to an enhancement of the maximum proton energy (25 %), the proton flux (factor of 3) and the beam uniformity. The experimental results of the second campaign on defocusing of high-intensity laser pulses onto the target show significant improvements in proton flux. Proton beams were generated more efficiently than previously by driving thinner target foils at a lower intensity over a large area. The optimum condition was a 2 micrometer foil irradiated with an intensity of 10 ^ 19 W/cm^ 2 onto a 60 micrometer spot. Laser to proton beam efficiencies of 7. 8 % have been achieved (2. 2 % before) [...] one of the highest conversion efficiencies ever achieved. RIS has contributed significantly {{to the understanding of the}} beam optimisation process and the proton parameters. In the frame of this work, two separate experiments at the TRIDENT laser system have shown that these laser-accelerated proton beams, with their high number of particles in a short pulse duration, are well-suited for creating isochorically heated matter in extreme conditions. Besides the manipulation of the proton beam parameters directly during the generation, the primary aim of this thesis was the capture, control and transport of laser-accelerated proton beams by a solenoidal <b>magnetic</b> field <b>lense</b> for further purpose. In a joint project proposal, the laser and plasma physics group of the Technische Universität Darmstadt initiated the development of a test stand to transport, focus and bunch rotate these beams by conventional ion optics and RF technology. In collaboration with the accelerator department of the GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung, a possible injection into a post-acceleration unit will be studied. Subordinated to this project, an experimental campaign to capture laser-accelerated proton beams was carried out at the PHELIX system. Compared to previous experiments, a significant increase in proton transmission through the solenoid could be achieved by maintaining the beam quality. The field strength of 7. 5 T enabled collimation of protons with an energy of > 10 MeV for the first time. In addition, the focusing capability of the solenoid provided a flux increase in the focal spot of about a factor of 174 at a distance of 40 cm from the source, compared to a beam without using the magnetic field. For a quantitative analysis of the experiment numerical simulations with the WarpRZ code were performed. The code, which was originally developed to study high current ion beams and aid in the pursuit of heavy-ion driven inertial confinement fusion, was modified to enable the use of laser-accelerated proton beams as particle source. The calculated energy-resolved beam parameters of RIS could be included, and the plasma simulation criteria were studied in detail. The geometrical boundaries of the experimental setup were used in the simulations. The results from the virtual simulated film stack show a remarkable agreement with the observed proton signals in the film stack of the experiment. The importance of the space-charge effects of the electrons (included as second particle species) could be pointed out showing a significant influence on the results. 2. 99 exp+ 9 collimated protons in the energy range of 13. 5 +- 1 MeV (Delta E/E = 7 %) could be transported over a distance of 40 cm. In addition, 8. 42 exp+ 9 protons in the energy range of 6. 7 +- 0. 2 MeV (Delta E/E = 3 %) were focused into a spot of < 2 mm in diameter. The transmission through the solenoid for both cases was about 18 %. The experiments and simulations carried out in the scope of this work are the basis for the realization of the test stand for coupling laser-accelerated proton beams into conventional accelerators structures. Furthermore, the code development enables future parameter studies prior to experimentation to optimize the output for additional applications...|$|R
