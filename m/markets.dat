5|$|As {{the capital}} of Silla, {{commerce}} and trading in Gyeongju developed early on. Samguk Sagi has records on the establishment of Gyeongdosi (capital area market) in March, 490 during King Soji's reign, and Dongsi (East Market) in 509, during King Jijeung's reign. In the 1830s, Gyeongju had five five-day <b>markets</b> which remained very active until the late 1920s. Due to its size Gyeongju Bunaejang (Gyeongju village market) {{was referred to as}} one of the two leading <b>markets</b> in the Yeongnam area, along with Daegu Bunaejang. Transportation developed in the late period of the Japanese occupation, as the Jungang Line and the Daegu Line and the connecting route between Pohang and the northwestern part of Japan were set up, leading to increasing population and developing commerce. After the 1960s, traditional periodic <b>markets</b> gradually transformed into regular <b>markets</b> as the city was flourishing. In periodic <b>markets,</b> agricultural and marine products, industrial products, living necessaries, wild edible greens, herbs, and cattle are mainly traded. As of 2006, Gyeongju had eight regular <b>markets,</b> nine periodic <b>markets</b> and the Gyeongju department store. Traditional periodic <b>markets</b> declined and have become token affairs these days.|$|E

These <b>markets</b> were found in corners of large cities. Some stayed open for twenty- four hours.
