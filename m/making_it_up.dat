5|$|Cad & the Dandy {{launched}} a new flagship store at 13 Savile Row in June 2013. The store is the first on the iconic tailoring street to hand-weave a cloth before <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> into a fully finished suit. Believing that Britain’s bespoke tailoring industry was facing a shortage of master tailors, the company established an apprenticeship programme in London, with young would-be tailors joining Cad & the Dandy’s 22 staff members at its three London locations, Savile Row, Birchin Lane and Canary Wharf.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Dyson swarm, the {{constructs}} <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> {{are not in}} orbit around the star, but would be statites—satellites suspended by use of enormous light sails using radiation pressure to counteract the star's pull of gravity. Such constructs {{would not be in}} danger of collision or of eclipsing one another; they would be totally stationary with regard to the star, and independent of one another. Because the ratio of radiation pressure to the force of gravity from a star is constant regardless of the distance (provided the statite has an unobstructed line-of-sight to the surface of its star), such statites could also vary their distance from their central star.|$|E
5|$|During {{a routine}} liposuction {{operation}} in Winnetka, Illinois, Dr. Harrison Lloyd (John Juliani) suddenly begins to remove so much fat {{from a patient}} that the patient dies. Following the unusual experience, Lloyd tells Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) that he killed the patient because he was possessed. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is skeptical about Lloyd's claims, believing he's only <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to escape legal consequences. Mulder inspects the operation room and discovers a pentagram burned into the floor; he begins to suspect that witchcraft might have {{played a part in}} the crime. Meanwhile, the staff at Lloyd's clinic are shocked when another plastic surgeon, Dr. Ilaqua (Paul Raskin), murders an elderly patient by burning a hole through her cheek and neck with a surgical laser, severing her brain stem. Scully interviews Ilaqua, who claims that he cannot remember anything of the incident. Mulder's suspicions are strengthened when he reviews the tape of the second murder, and he sees a pentagram-like pattern on the stomach of the victim.|$|E

50|$|Another attacking ploy is {{to pitch}} a ball very short, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> bounce <b>up</b> around head height {{as it passes}} the batsman. Such a bouncer {{requires}} the batsman to avoid being hit, and may intimidate him into uncertainty about the next few balls.|$|R
25|$|Task Force 78 was {{activated}} {{as a unit}} of the Seventh Fleet on 24 November 1972, while {{peace talks}} still were underway in Paris, and the ships and helicopter units <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> secretly gathered in the Philippines. The talks broke down in December 1972, however, so the task force awaited further developments into January 1973 while its helicopter crews practiced towing their minesweeping equipment in Subic Bay.|$|E
500|$|Alistair Taylor (Epstein's assistant) later {{admitted}} that financial mistakes were made: [...] "We did our best; {{some people have}} said it wasn't good enough. That's easy to say with 20/20 hindsight but remember {{that there were no}} rules. We were <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> as we went along." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Nielsen Media Research, an {{estimated}} 9.07 million viewers watched [...] "The Convict" [...] {{on its first}} broadcast, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to that point the largest audience of the season. Among adults aged 18 to 49, it earned a 4.4/11 ratings share, finishing in eighteenth place for the week among all the major networks. Television critics were largely positive towards the episode, particularly Carell's [...] "Prison Mike" [...] sequence as well as Helms' performance as Andy Bernard.|$|E
50|$|This {{stream is}} very rocky near its mouth, with broken slate {{covering}} the streambed. Occasional deep pools {{exist on the}} streambed. It is fed by periodic springs, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> dry <b>up</b> very easily {{when it is not}} raining. Fish have a difficult time living in the stream because <b>it</b> dries <b>up</b> often.|$|R

500|$|Eddington was a marvellous popular {{lecturer}} who had enthralled {{an audience}} of 600 for his entire course. [...] The same audience turned up to Whitehead's first lecture but it was completely unintelligible, not merely to {{the world at large}} but to the elect. [...] My father remarked to me afterwards that if he had not known Whitehead well he would have suspected that it was an imposter <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> as he went along... The audience at subsequent lectures was only about half a dozen in all.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Writing for The Cincinnati Enquirer, John Kiesewetter criticized the show's use of improvised dialogue: [...] "The uneven plot and sophomoric bodily function jokes sound like {{these people were}} <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> as they went along. And they were." [...] Rob Owen, television critic for the Post-Gazette, paralleled Kiesewetter {{and said that the}} episode was a [...] "pitfall" [...] of the improvisation process: [...] "The half-hour seems like a collection of scenes rather than a cohesive episode." [...] Owen called it [...] "so lackadaisical, it's hard to imagine UPN's most recently announced target audience - young males - having any patience for the program. The entertainment value is low", but did note that McGuirk's scenes in the episode were [...] "the closest to ha-ha funny the show gets." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented {{on the structure of}} the series' first season. [...] "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E

Maggie would never dream of going out in the car with Biggs." ...|$|R

2500|$|.....psychoanalysis can {{and should}} make a basic {{contribution}} to a politics of autonomy. For, each person's self-understanding is {{a necessary condition for}} autonomy. One cannot have an autonomous society that would fail to turn back upon itself, that would not interrogate itself about its motives, its reasons for acting, its deep-seated [...] tendencies. Considered in concrete terms, however, society doesn't exist outside the individuals <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> The self-reflective activity of an autonomous society depends essentially upon the self-reflective activity of the humans who form that society.|$|E
2500|$|The {{series is}} a thriller, love story, and mystery with {{an element of}} science fiction. Unlike other well known series of the same genre, {{producers}} had promised timely answers to mysteries, with some answers provided {{as early as the}} upcoming episode. Executive producer Evan Katz stated that [...] "everything is designed to answer questions so you're not frustrated or feeling like we're <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> as we go along" [...] and the writers intended to keep the viewers guessing in a [...] "fair way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Neela Debnath of The Independent praised Nina Toussaint-White in {{her role}} as Mels, saying she was [...] "every bit as sassy and vivacious as her later incarnation... it was a shame that she {{regenerated}} so early on because she brought a different energy to the character". However, Neil McCormick in The Daily Telegraph thought that her sudden introduction as Rory and Amy's childhood friend showed that Moffat was <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> as he went along. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 felt that River Song was at her [...] "high point" [...] in some of the early Matt Smith episodes, where she was [...] "generally badass and mysterious". However, with [...] "The Wedding of River Song", Anders felt she had lost her mystery and independence, and her love for the Doctor was unrealistic.|$|E

5000|$|Allegedly {{there had}} been {{meetings}} with four individual nationalists, including [...] "Richard", being the defendant's [...] "mentor", and described as a [...] "perfect knight", in a [...] "founding" [...] session. The prosecution attacked Breivik's version and alleged that he was <b>making</b> <b>it</b> all <b>up.</b> By some accounts the defendant would get vexed at the repeated suggestion {{that there is no}} such network, and he insisted there are 15-20 members in the Knights Templar.|$|R
2500|$|Noel Gallagher (from Uncut {{magazine}} August 2007): [...] "We were in Paris {{playing with}} the Verve, and I had the chords for that song and started writing it. We were due to play 2 days later. Our first-ever big arena gig, it's called Sheffield Arena now. At the sound check, I was strumming away on the acoustic guitar, and our kid (Liam Gallagher) said, 'What's that you're singin'?' I wasn't singing anyway, I was just <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> And our kid said, 'Are you singing 'So Sally can wait'.' And I was like – that's genius! So I started singing, 'So Sally can wait.' I remember {{going back to the}} dressing room and writing it out. It all came really quickly after that." [...] Noel claims that the character [...] "Lyla", from Oasis' 2005 single is the sister of Sally. In the interview on the DVD released with the special edition of Stop the Clocks, Noel also revealed that a girl approached him and asked him if Sally was the same girl as in the Stone Roses' track [...] "Sally Cinnamon". Noel replied that he'd never thought of that but thought it was good anyway.|$|E
2500|$|Tejada {{perceived}} Traditionalism as {{a unique}} Spanish response to the 1515-1648 rupture in European political thought; the latter afterwards degenerated into absolutism, liberalism, totalitarism, and most recently into secular, parliamentarian, free-market, nation-state democracies. Traditionalism itself was politically best embodied in Carlism. Its essence was threefold. First, it consisted of Catholic unity; some scholars claim that Tejada was opposed to religious liberty, others maintain that he was opposed to equality of faiths and advocated a state-endorsed Catholic orthodoxy. Second, it embraced historical, social, accountable, representative, foral, federative, missionary, organic and hereditary monarchy. Third, {{it was based on}} a subsidiary state model. The latter marked total reversal from original Tejada's penchant for omnipotent leadership and reflected the Traditionalist logic of state serving society, society serving man, and man serving God. A de-centralized withdrawn state, with is functions reduced, is to provide merely a framework for communities <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> developed historically and safeguarded by separate legal establishments; The communities in question are to be governed by autonomous intermediary bodies and should participate in state politics represented in the Cortes by delegates of various [...] "gremios, hermandades, agrupaciones, cámaras, comunidades y cofradías"; Tejada juxtaposed Spanish communitarian fueros against the French individual liberties. According to some, the proposal advanced by Tejada was intended as a discussion how Spain should look like after Franco.|$|E

50|$|The {{writers of}} folk ragtime often simply mixed {{together}} themes of theirs {{in a random}} fashion, in structure loosely resembling the typical Classic Rag structure (IntroAABBACCDD.) Good testimony of this are the legendary multiple takes of Folk Rags by Sanford Brunson Campbell, recorded on acetates in 1947. They illustrate a performer who embellishes and improvises on basic themes, at times seeming {{as if he is}} <b>making</b> <b>it</b> all <b>up</b> as he goes along.|$|R
