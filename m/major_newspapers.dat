5|$|The {{pressure}} and the perceived conflict of interest faced by the baseball writers who scored games for MLB eventually led many <b>major</b> <b>newspapers</b> to end the practice for their employees. In 1958, The Washington Post prohibited their writers from scoring baseball games. Over {{the next two decades}} other <b>major</b> <b>newspapers</b> joined in the writer-scorer ban, including The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Boston Globe, and the major daily newspapers published in Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia. In 1980, MLB resolved the conflict by directly hiring official scorers for each stadium.|$|E
5|$|Although McCain {{was seriously}} wounded and injured, his captors refused to treat him. They beat and interrogated {{him to get}} information, and he was given medical care only when the North Vietnamese {{discovered}} {{that his father was}} a high-ranking admiral. His status as a prisoner of war (POW) made the front pages of <b>major</b> <b>newspapers.</b>|$|E

5|$|Coverage of {{this event}} varied {{significantly}} between Nashville's two <b>major</b> <b>newspapers.</b> The Tennessean emphasized the mayor's agreement that lunch counters should be desegregated, while the Nashville Banner emphasized the mayor's statement that {{it was up to}} the city's merchants to decide whether to desegregate. This was largely indicative of the two papers' opposing stances on the issue. Regardless, the mayor's response was later cited as an important turning point by both activists and Nashville business owners.|$|E

50|$|Worse yet, the Trib's closure {{happened}} {{at the same time}} as the closing of the Ottawa Journal. In 1980, the Ottawa Journal had been purchased by Thomson Newspapers and was closed on August 26, 1980. This left Southam's Ottawa Citizen as the only <b>major</b> <b>newspaper</b> in Ottawa, and the Thompsons' Winnipeg Free Press the only <b>major</b> <b>newspaper</b> in Winnipeg.|$|R

5|$|The {{declaration}} {{represented the}} first public support for Zionism by a major political power – its publication galvanized Zionism, which finally had obtained an official charter. In addition to its publication in <b>major</b> <b>newspapers,</b> leaflets were circulated throughout Jewish communities.

5|$|William Aberhart's Social Credit League, running {{candidates}} for the first time, won a large majority in the 1935 Alberta election {{on the strength of}} promises to use a new economic theory called social credit to end depression conditions in the province.

Some of the province's <b>major</b> <b>newspapers</b> were loyal to one of the traditional parties: the Edmonton Bulletin, for example, had supported the Liberals since its inception.|$|E

5|$|Although textile-related {{engineering}} declined {{with the}} processing industry, {{leading to the}} demise of both Stotts and Platts, other engineering firms existed, notably electrical and later electronic engineers Ferranti in 1896. Ferranti went into receivership in 1993, but some of its former works continue in other hands. Part of the original Hollinwood site was operated by Siemens Metering and Semiconductor divisions. The remainder of the site is occupied by Mirror Colour Print Ltd; the printing division of the Trinity Mirror group, which prints and distributes thirty-six <b>major</b> <b>newspapers,</b> and employs five hundred staff.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} most prestigious reviewers ignored the book, leaving it to book trade and library {{publications}} such as Kirkus Reviews and Booklist, which examined it only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by Cooperative Children's Book Center Choices, which pointed out the complexity, depth and consistency of the world Rowling had built) {{attracted the attention of}} reviewers in <b>major</b> <b>newspapers.</b> Although The Boston Globe and Michael Winerip in The New York Times complained that the final chapters were the weakest part of the book, they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise.|$|E
5|$|Newspaper writers {{initially}} performed {{this function}} {{in the early days}} of Major League Baseball (MLB). As the importance of baseball player statistics increased, teams began to pressure writer-scorers for favorable scoring decisions for their players in games played at home stadiums, and a home team scoring bias was perceived by many coaches, players, and writers. Controversies related to perceived bias or errors in scoring have led to questions about important baseball records, including several no-hitters and Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak of 1941. By 1979, many <b>major</b> <b>newspapers</b> decided to ban their writers from scoring baseball games due to conflict-of-interest concerns, and in 1980 MLB began to hire independent official scorers.|$|E

5|$|Palmer and Buckner {{both had}} {{developed}} reputations as independent executives {{while serving as}} governors of their respective states. Because they had served on opposite sides during the Civil War, their presence on the same ticket emphasized national unity. The ticket was endorsed by several <b>major</b> <b>newspapers</b> including the Chicago Chronicle, Louisville Courier-Journal, Detroit Free Press, Richmond Times, and New Orleans Picayune. Despite these advantages, the ticket was hurt by the candidates' ages, Palmer being 79and Buckner 73. Further, some supporters feared that voting for the National Democrat ticket would be a wasted vote and might even throw the election to Bryan. Ultimately, Palmer and Buckner received just over {{one percent of the}} vote in the election.|$|E
5|$|Six of the {{cartoons}} were first reprinted by the Egyptian newspaper El Fagr on 17 October 2005, {{along with an}} article strongly denouncing them, but this did not provoke any condemnations or other reactions from religious or government authorities. Between October 2005 and early January 2006, examples of {{the cartoons}} were reprinted in major European newspapers from the Netherlands, Germany, Scandinavia, Romania, and Switzerland. After the beginning of major international protests, they were re-published around the globe, but primarily in continental Europe. The cartoons were not reprinted in any <b>major</b> <b>newspapers</b> in Canada, the United Kingdom, or many in the United States where articles covered the story without including them.|$|E
