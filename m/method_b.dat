40|$|Due to the {{relatively}} low conversion efficiency of electrons into X-rays, the use of X-rays on an industrial basis requires high-power high-energy electron accelerators. Based on its experience acquired {{in the development of}} the Rhodotron (Nucl. Instrum. <b>Methods</b> <b>B</b> 40 / 41 (1989) 943; Nucl. Instrum. <b>Methods</b> <b>B</b> 79 (1993) 865), IBA has launched a few years ago a vigorous R&D program to develop such high-power electron accelerator devoted to X-ray industrial applications. This research program resulted in the TT 1000 Rhodotron aimed at delivering 5 and 7 MeV electron beams with a current intensity of 100 mA. This project is now reaching its final phase with the qualification tests of the first prototype of this new machine. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Variability in the {{intensity}} of anticoagulant therapy is considered {{a risk factor for}} complications, but it is unclear how best to quantify variability. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association of three methods to measure variability with complications of oral anticoagulant therapy. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study within a cohort of patients with prosthetic heart valves. 210 patients with a first hemorrhagic or thrombotic event during follow-up were selected with two controls per case, matched on age and sex. We calculated the time spent at an International Normalized Ratio below, above, and between 2. 5 and 4. 0, and the variance growth rate according to three different <b>methods</b> (A, <b>B</b> 1, <b>B</b> 2); <b>method</b> A combines variability and time in range, and <b>methods</b> <b>B</b> 1 and B 2 purely look at variability. RESULTS: Odds ratios of the variance growth rates for thrombotic events for patients {{in the second and third}} tertiles varied between 2 and 3, with the highest odds ratio for complications for the method that purely looked at variability. For hemorrhagic complications, the highest odds ratios were found for method A, which also incorporated time in range, with odds ratios of 2. 6 (95 % CI: 1. 3 - 5. 1) and 3. 1 (95 % CI: 1. 6 - 6. 0) for the second and third tertiles as compared to the first. The combination of time spent out of range with the highest tertile of variability increased the risk 2. 6 -fold (95 % CI: 1. 6 - 4. 2) as compared to subjects with stable anticoagulation within the target range. CONCLUSION: Unstable anticoagulation was associated with hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. Method A was best associated with complications, but <b>methods</b> <b>B</b> 1 and B 2, in combination with time spent in range, were equally well associated. As we prefer to disentangle variability and intensity of anticoagulation, we propose to use <b>methods</b> <b>B</b> 1 or B 2 to reflect pure variability of oral anticoagulant therapy...|$|R
