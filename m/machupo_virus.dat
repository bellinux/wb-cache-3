40|$|Arenaviruses {{comprise}} a diverse family of enveloped negative-strand RNA viruses that are endemic to specific rodent hosts worldwide. Several arenaviruses cause severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans, including Junín and <b>Machupo</b> <b>viruses</b> in South America and Lassa fever virus in western Africa. Arenavirus {{entry into the}} host cell is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein complex, GPC. The virion is endocytosed on binding to a cell-surface receptor, and membrane fusion is initiated in response to physiological acidification of the endosome. As with other class I virus fusion proteins, GPC-mediated membrane fusion is promoted through a regulated sequence of conformational changes leading to formation of the classical postfusion trimer-of-hairpins structure. GPC is, however, unique among the class I fusion proteins in that the mature complex retains a stable signal peptide (SSP) as a third subunit, {{in addition to the}} canonical receptor-binding and fusion proteins. We will review the curious properties of the tripartite GPC complex and describe evidence that SSP interacts with the fusion subunit to modulate pH-induced activation of membrane fusion. This unusual solution to maintaining the metastable prefusion state of GPC on the virion and activating the class I fusion cascade at acidic pH provides novel targets for antiviral intervention...|$|R

40|$|Arenaviruses {{cause severe}} hemorrhagic fever {{diseases}} in humans, {{and there are}} limited preventative and therapeutic measures against these diseases. Previous structural and functional analyses of arenavirus nucleoproteins (NPs) revealed a conserved DEDDH exoribonuclease (RNase) domain that is important for type I interferon (IFN) suppression, but the biological roles of the NP RNase in viral replication and host immune suppression have not been well characterized. Infection of guinea pigs with Pichinde virus (PICV), a prototype arenavirus, {{can serve as a}} surrogate small animal model for arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers. In this report, we show that mutation of each of the five RNase catalytic residues of PICV NP diminishes the IFN suppression activity and slightly reduces the viral RNA replication activity. Recombinant PICVs with RNase catalytic mutations can induce high levels of IFNs and barely grow in IFN-competent A 549 cells, {{in sharp contrast to the}} wild-type (WT) virus, while in IFN-deficient Vero cells, both WT and mutant viruses can replicate at relatively high levels. Upon infection of guinea pigs, the RNase mutant viruses stimulate strong IFN responses, fail to replicate productively, and can become WT revertants. Serial passages of the RNase mutants in vitro can also generate WT revertants. Thus, the NP RNase function is essential for the innate immune suppression that allows the establishment of a productive early viral infection, and it may be partly involved in the process of viral RNA replication. IMPORTANCE Arenaviruses, such as Lassa, Lujo, and <b>Machupo</b> <b>viruses,</b> can cause severe and deadly hemorrhagic fever diseases in humans, and there are limited preventative and treatment options against these diseases. Development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs depends on a better mechanistic understanding of the conserved arenavirus proteins in viral infection. The nucleoprotein (NPs) of all arenaviruses carry a unique exoribonuclease (RNase) domain that has been shown to be critical for the suppression of type I interferons. However, the functional roles of the NP RNase in arenavirus replication and host immune suppression have not been characterized systematically. Using a prototype arenavirus, Pichinde virus (PICV), we characterized the viral growth and innate immune suppression of recombinant RNase-defective mutants in both cell culture and guinea pig models. Our study suggests that the NP RNase plays an essential role in the suppression of host innate immunity, and possibly in viral RNA replication, and that it can serve as a novel target for developing antiviral drugs against arenavirus pathogens...|$|R

40|$|Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a {{group of}} {{infectious}} diseases with similar symptoms in people; the causative viruses affect the vascular system and can produce a severe multisystemic illness in some patients.

40|$|The virus family Arenaviridae {{includes}} several hemorrhagic fever causing agents such as Lassa, Guanarito, Junin, <b>Machupo,</b> and Sabia <b>virus</b> that pose {{a major public}} health concern to the human population in West African and South American countries. Current treatment options to control fatal outcome of disease are limited to the ribonucleoside analogue ribavirin, although its use has some significant limitations. The lack of effective treatment alternatives emphasizes the need for novel antiviral therapeutics to counteract these life-threatening infections. Maturation cleavage of the viral envelope glycoprotein by the host cell proprotein convertase site 1 protease (S 1 P) is critical for infectious virion production of several pathogenic arenaviruses. This finding makes this protease an attractive target {{for the development of}} novel anti-arenaviral therapeutics. We demonstrate here that highly selective S 1 P-adapted α 1 -antitrypsins have the potential to efficiently inhibit glycoprotein processing, which resulted in reduced Lassa virus replication. Our findings suggest that S 1 P should be considered as an antiviral target and that further optimization of modified α 1 -antitrypsins could lead to potent and specific S 1 P inhibitors with the potential for treatment of certain viral hemorrhagic fevers...|$|R
50|$|The Lassa virus gains {{entry into}} the host cell {{by means of the}} cell-surface {{receptor}} the alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG),a versatile receptor for proteins of the extracellular matrix. It shares this receptor with the prototypic Old World arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Receptor recognition depends on a specific sugar modification of alpha-dystroglycan by a group of glycosyltransferases known as the LARGE proteins. Specific variants of the genes encoding these proteins appear to be under positive selection in West Africa where Lassa is endemic. Alpha-dystroglycan is also used as a receptor by viruses of the New World clade C arenaviruses (Oliveros and Latino viruses). In contrast, the New World arenaviruses of clades A and B, which include the important <b>viruses</b> <b>Machupo,</b> Guanarito, Junin, and Sabia in addition to the non pathogenic Amapari virus, use the transferrin receptor 1. A small aliphatic amino acid at the GP1 glycoprotein amino acid position 260 is required for high-affinity binding to alpha-DG. In addition, GP1 amino acid position 259 also appears to be important, since all arenaviruses showing high-affinity alpha-DG binding possess a bulky aromatic amino acid (tyrosine or phenylalanine) at this position.|$|R
