5000|$|Game play is {{centered}} on advancement {{through a series of}} scenarios corresponding to the adventures of the books. Players turn tiles and play cards in order to move forward, and collect and spend tokens to avoid advancement toward the Dark Lord Sauron. In dire situations, tokens may be spent to call for the assistance of Gandalf, or the One Ring may be used to speed advancement at the cost of moving closer toward Sauron. On the <b>master</b> <b>board</b> there are three locations: Bag End, Rivendell, and Lothlórien. The game starts at Bag End and each player draws a card identifying the player's Hobbit character, each of which has a special ability. Each player is dealt cards that allow him to complete four different activities: traveling, hiding, friendship or fighting. One hobbit is initially assigned to be the [...] "ring bearer", but a new hobbit may become the ring bearer after each scenario is completed. The journey through the game calls for jumping {{back and forth between the}} main board and the other four boards. Players advance through locations such as Rivendell, Lothlórien, Moria, Helm's Deep, Shelob’s Lair, and Mordor; all while trying to stay away from the dark lord Sauron. Players are eliminated if they are on the same space as Sauron or are behind him. The game concludes when the fellowship reaches Mount Doom and destroys the Ring, the ring bearer is eliminated, or if the Fellowship reaches Mount Doom yet all players are eliminated before the ring is destroyed. Players need to cooperate and work together in order to beat this game. Players must display strategy and have a little luck. Knowledge of The Lord of the Rings plot isn’t needed to play the game, yet might help in some situations.|$|E

40|$|Prototypes {{of a new}} hybrid pixel {{detector}} and a high resistivity detector {{with short}} strips, developed by the VIPIX Collaboration and aimed at equipping the layer- 0 of the SuperB vertex detector, have been tested in September 2011 with a 120 GeV pion beam at the SPS H 6 beam line at CERN. They are placed {{at the center of}} a reference telescope consisting of six planes of silicon detector with a double-sided strip readout. Both the telescope and the detectors under test (DUT) are equipped with a custom-design, data-push digital readout. The main elements of the trigger and data acquisition system are two VME boards (EDRO) organized in a master-slave configuration and responsible for programming the front-end chips of both the telescope and the DUT. The <b>master</b> <b>board</b> distributes a global synchronization clock and the triggers to all devices, including two 3 x 3 analog-maps matrices placed behind the DUT and supplied with an independent readout.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of the mixing angle theta 13 {{is the goal of}} several running and planned experiments. The experiments are either accelerator based (super) beam experiments (e. g. MINOS, T 2 K, Nova) or reactor anti-neutrino disappearance experiments (e. g. Daya Bay, RENO or Double Chooz). In order to measure or constrain theta 13 with the Double Chooz experiment the overall systematic errors have to be controlled at the one-percent or sub-percent level. The limitation of the systematic errors is achieved through various means and techniques. E. g. the experiment consists of two identical detectors at different baselines, which allow to make a differential anti-neutrino flux measurement, where basically only relative normalisation errors remain. The requirements on the systematic errors put also strong constraints on the quality of all components and materials used for both detectors, most prominently on the stability and radiopurity of the scintillator, the photomultiplier tubes, the vessels containing the detector liquids and the shielding against ambient radioactivity. The readout electronics, trigger and data acquisition system have to operate reliably as an integrated and highly efficient whole over several years. The trigger is provided by the Level- 1 Trigger and Timing System, which {{is the subject of this}} thesis. It has to provide a highly efficient trigger (at the 0. 1 % level) for neutrino-induced events as well as for several types of background events. Its decision is realized in hardware and based on energy depositions in the muon veto and the target region. The Level- 1 Trigger and Timing System furthermore provides a common System Clock and an absolute timestamp for each event. The Level- 1 Trigger and Timing System consists of two types of VME modules, several Trigger Boards and a Trigger <b>Master</b> <b>Board,</b> which have been custom-designed and developed in the electronics workshop of our institute for this experiment and purpose, starting in 2005. In this thesis all components of the Level- 1 Trigger and Timing System are introduced and described as well as their interfaces to other hard- and software components of the Double Chooz electronics and data acquisition system. Test procedures and software have been developed, which have been used to qualify the first prototypes of the Trigger Board and Trigger <b>Master</b> <b>Board.</b> In case of the Trigger Board this eventually led to the production of a second prototype with improved design. Especially the Analog Part of the Trigger Board, which is the most sensitive and critical section of the module, has been scrutinized and it could be demonstrated, that it meets the requirements of the Double Chooz Experiment...|$|E

I {{think this is a}} concern of anyone who hasn’t worked with Ethernet. I associate Ethernet with the Internet and the World Wide Web, so the first thing that popped into my head was hosting a web page from an embedded system. Then I found out we would just be transferring data over an Ethernet network from one <b>master</b> <b>board</b> to several slave boards. After spending a little time researching and implementing the application, I was surprised at how easy adding Ethernet capabilities to an embedded system could be. Much of the complexity is taken care of by the TCP/IP stack and the ease of use it provides. My biggest surprise was that I didn’t need to be a TCP/IP expert, and all I needed to know was how to correctly implement a series of API routines. In this article, I will discuss the basics of creating your own Ethernet messaging application. There will be a brief introduction to the TCP/IP protocol. We will look at the “Sockets ” API, since most TCP/IP stacks use this as a template for their own API. Using an example design, we will discuss creating our own messaging protocol for a...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT  This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} a study completed at Volvo Aero Corporation in Trollhättan during the autumn 2011. The focus {{of this study was to}} identify how the technical ordering in the department of Engine Services & Engine Assembly is working with Lean Production, which is a method of business development. By working closely with a range of people within the department, it has been possible to complete interviews, meetings, surveys, etc. this has led to that the problem formulation of the thesis have been processed in detail. Three issues have been addressed in this work. The questions are: How to work with Lean in a technology department and how does this work? How to connect the technology department's planning boards with the <b>master</b> <b>board,</b> which is a comprehensive planning board, in an efficient way? Can the technology department contribute to a further improvement in Engine Services & Engine Assembly? The results of the study can be found in Chapter 5 of this report. This result plays an important role in Engine Services & Engine Assembly, as the introduction of Lean Production implies continuous improvement for the company. ii The final part of the report consists of a conclusion and a discussion.

40|$|The LHCb sub-detector {{electronics}} {{requires a}} configuration bus {{able to communicate}} fast and properly over an up to 120 -meter line, with a unique master, and up to 32 slaves located on the detector. In such a configuration, the master card will {{be located in the}} control room, which is not exposed to radiation, and the slave close to the detector electronics boards. The slave thus has to be both SEL and SEU immune, in order to work properly in radiation sensitive environments (up to 40 Krad of total dose). The SPECS protocol is a 10 Mbit/s serial link designed for the configuration of remote electronics elements. SPECS is a single-master multi-slave bus. The protocol requires 4 lines in BLVDS technology with pole-zero cancellation at the emitter side. The SPECS frame is composed of a fixed-size header (8 -bit words which contain information relevant to the transfer), a variable-size data block, and a fixed-size trailer with the checksum of the data block :The SPECS <b>master</b> <b>board</b> will host 4 SPECS masters. This board is implemented on a standard 3. 3 V 32 -bit 33 MHz PCI board. The heart of the system is designed as a portable VERILOG code and integrated within an Altera Cyclone FPGA, the PCI interface being performed by a dedicated circuit (PLX 9030). The SPECS slave offers different interfaces: Point to point SPECS interface for long distance interconnections, Multi drop SPECS bus, Local bus parallel interface, 32 configuration I/O lines, JTAG master interface, long distance I 2 C master bus, 24 commands driver to manage 12 independent links. An intermediate mezzanine board of 0. 47 dm² houses the SPECS slave, and provides all the described functionalities using 2 SMC connectors. The mezzanine board also provides most of the necessary service functions for the sub-detector front-end electronics.
