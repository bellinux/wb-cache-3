5|$|In 2004, an Oregon ballot <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have {{increased}} the amount of cannabis a patient can legally possess to six pounds was defeated by Oregon voters. In 2005, the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program brought in more than $900,000 to the state's budget for the Department of Human Services.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{oversaw the}} {{transition}} of the University of Louisville from municipal to state funding. He pushed for reforms to the state's education system, giving up his own chairmanship of the University of Kentucky board of trustees and extending voting rights to student and faculty members of university boards. These changes generally shifted administration positions in the state's colleges from political rewards to professional appointments. He increased funding to the state's education budget and gave expanded powers to the Council on Higher Education. He vetoed a <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have allowed collective bargaining for teachers.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Mayor Cheye Calvo {{proposed}} a <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> require every Maryland police department that operates a SWAT team to submit biannual reports on its activities, including {{where and when}} it was deployed and whether an operation resulted in arrests, evidence seizures, or injuries. The bill passed that same year, despite strong opposition from Maryland's police agencies. Maryland was the first state to adopt such legislation; Utah became the second when it passed a similar bill in March 2014.|$|E

5|$|In January 1800, {{recognising}} that Valletta was {{in danger}} of surrendering if it could not be resupplied, the French Navy prepared a convoy at Toulon, consisting of Généreux, under Captain Cyprien Renaudin, the 20-gun corvettes Badine, Fauvette and 16-gun Sans Pareille and two or three transport ships. The force was under the command of Contre-amiral Jean-Baptiste Perrée, recently exchanged under parole after being captured off Acre the previous year, and was instructed to approach Valletta along the Maltese coast from the southwest with the intention of passing between the blockade squadron and the shore and entering Malta before the British could discover and intercept them. The convoy sailed on 7 February. In addition to the supplies, the convoy carried nearly 3,000 French soldiers to reinforce the garrison, an unnecessary <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> completely counteract the replenishment of the garrison's food stocks.|$|E
5|$|The planned {{extensions}} and realignment of the Canarsie Line were cancelled in 1973, due {{to community}} opposition against the proposed expressways {{that the line}} would have been built along with. Later that year, the LIE line was canceled because New York state voters had declined a $3.5 billion bond <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have paid for five subway extensions, including the LIE line. This {{was the second time}} that voters declined a bond issue to finance this extension, with the first being on November 2, 1971 for $2.5 billion. The defeat set back the construction of subway construction projects, including the Lower East Side Loop, the Utica Avenue Line, the Nostrand Avenue extension, the Jamaica Avenue Line, and the Northeast Queens Line. The 1973 bond issue, in addition to financing the LIE line would have also paid for an extension of the IRT Dyre Avenue Line to Co-op City, an extension of the IND Queens Boulevard Line to Hillside Avenue and Springfield Boulevard, a joint LIRR/subway extension from the Atlantic Avenue LIRR terminal to Lower Manhattan, and a branch of the Queens Boulevard Line at 63rd Drive to the Rockaways via the abandoned Rockaway Beach Branch. The double fare to the Rockaways would have been removed, and while this was not done as part of the bond issue, it was removed on September 1, 1975. However, the MTA believed that many other projects would still be built. By November 1974, the MTA projected a 1981 opening date for the Archer Avenue Line to Springfield Boulevard, as well as a 1982 opening date for the 63rd Street Line and for the SAS from 34th Street to 125th Street. In 1983, the Queens Super Express Bypass was to open, and in the same year, the Bronx extension of the SAS and the BMT Jamaica Line reroute to Archer Avenue would open. The MTA thought that the SAS's southern extension to Whitehall Street would open by 1988, and that by 1993, the Utica Avenue, Nostrand Avenue, and LIE subway lines and the LIRR East Side Access would all open.|$|E

25|$|On the {{question}} of slavery, Lincoln reportedly told the Confederates that Northern opinion was divided on {{the question}} of how new laws would be enforced.

25|$|While on the Board of Supervisors for Fairfax County, Connolly {{sponsored}} {{an ordinance}} {{that would have}} made it illegal to transport a loaded shotgun in the back of one's car. In Congress, Connolly signed onto a <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have closed the gun show loophole by requiring that private sellers of firearms at gun shows engage in the same background check and reporting requirements as registered firearms dealers. Connolly opposes allowing concealed weapons in schools and on college campuses.|$|E
25|$|In February 2017, {{while serving}} on the Ways and Means Committee, he voted against a <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{have led to a}} request of the Treasury Department for President Donald Trump's tax returns. The measure failed 23–15 on a party-line, with all 23 Republicans voting against the measure. Trump is the first {{president}} to break the precedent started by Richard Nixon of presidential candidates releasing their tax returns. The tax returns would shed light on Trump's financial ties and possible conflicts of interest.|$|E

25|$|Zionist {{political}} parties provided private {{education and health}} care: the General Zionists, the Mizrahi and the Socialist Zionists, each established independent health and education services and operated sports organizations funded by local taxes, donations and fees (the British administration did not invest in public services). During the whole interwar period, the British, appealing {{to the terms of}} the Mandate, rejected the principle of majority rule or any other <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> give the Arab population, who formed the majority of the population, control over Palestinian territory.|$|E
25|$|Japan, {{with the}} support of the United States and the United Kingdom, {{introduced}} a <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have restricted countries from transferring funds, material, or technology to North Korea. Russia and China, with veto power, resisted the resolution, saying a press statement should be issued. In an informal media conference, Russian UN ambassador Vitaly I. Churkin stated that, rather than sanctions, it may be more appropriate for the President of the United Nations Security Council to issue a condemning statement similar to what was done after the North Korean missile firing in 1998.|$|E
25|$|In February 2005, {{breaking}} {{ranks with}} fellow Senate Democrats, Lieberman {{voted for the}} Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, S. 5, which is a bill to curtail the ability of plaintiffs to file class action lawsuits against corporations in federal courts. The bill was backed by the White House and business groups as an essential tort reform <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> reduce {{what they said was}} a debilitating number of frivolous lawsuits. The bill was opposed by consumer advocacy groups and trial lawyers who argued that many valid claims against corporations would be dismissed, leaving consumers without legal recourse.|$|E

25|$|Earlier in the war, the Second Continental Congress promised {{officers}} {{they would}} receive a life pension of half-pay beginning on 21 October 1780. The army was well aware that Congress had {{made no effort to}} back up this promise. In January 1783, a committee of officers drew up a petition listing their grievances and Alexander McDougall presented it to Congress in company with Matthias Ogden and John Brooks. Differing from earlier petitions, this one spoke for the entire army, not just the officer corps. Behind the scenes, Washington wrote to members of Congress that the officers' claims were legitimate. Unfortunately, the Congress defeated a <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have given the officers full pay for five years as compensation for the promised pension.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} deal eliminated some of {{the spending}} cuts required by the sequester by $45 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in January and $18 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in 2015. This did not decrease federal spending; instead, by {{reducing the amount of}} spending cuts the government was going to be forced to make by the sequester, it actually increased government spending by $45 billion and $18 billion over what would have been spent had the sequester remained in place. Some Republicans wanted Speaker John Boehner to pursue a temporary <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> cover the rest of Fiscal Year 2014 at the level set by the sequester – $967 billion, rather than pass this budget deal, which would have $45 billion in additional spending.|$|E
25|$|Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) {{attempted}} {{to pass a}} more limited gun control <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have expanded background checks, but the bill was blocked in the Senate. Despite Obama's advocacy and subsequent mass shootings such as the Charleston church shooting, no major gun control bill passed Congress during Obama's presidency, {{in part due to}} the power of 2nd Amendment activists such as the National Rifle Association. Obama's presidency ironically saw expansion of gun rights in the United States, as the Supreme Court ruled in McDonald v. City of Chicago that the Second Amendment applies to the states in addition to the federal government. Obama signed into law two bills containing amendments reducing restrictions on gun owners, one which permitted guns to be transported in checked baggage on Amtrak trains and another which allowed the carrying of loaded firearms in national parks located in states allowing concealed carry.|$|E
5000|$|Sen. Kirk {{emphasized}} that Qatar remains a [...] "permissive environment for terrorist financing", and urged U.S. authorities to address Qatar’s permissiveness towards terrorist financing, {{a source of}} further regional and international instability, by enforcing <b>measures</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> make Qatar abstain from continuing sponsorship to terrorism.|$|R

50|$|Republicans in the Senate and Assembly have {{proposed}} <b>measures</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> limit collective-bargaining rights and increase pension contributions for state employees.
