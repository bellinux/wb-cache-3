40|$|Friedman {{identified}} his "natural rate" as Walrasian equilibrium. Keynes's "full employment" is also classical equilibrium: {{labor markets}} are clearing at existing real wages. Why is equilibrium unemployment not zero? Keynes and Friedman cite, {{but do not}} explain, "frictional" unemployment. They differ on what explains cycles. Friedman and Lucas answer: misperceptions of inflation. Markets clear at wrong prices and quantities. Today New Classicals stress variations in the natural rate itself. In Keynesian cycles markets don't clear. Excess supplies or demands trigger Phillips-curve movements of wages and prices. Unemployment and vacancies coexist in varying proportions because inter-sectoral shocks always occur. Adjustment dynamics, not representative-agent equilibria, determine the economy's behavior at NAIRU and other unemployment rates. Money makes a difference, not because of <b>money</b> <b>illusions</b> or misperceptions but because adjustments begin with nominal wage and price responses. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Money</b> <b>illusion</b> is {{believed}} to be instrumental in the Friedmanian version of the Phillips curve. Actually, <b>money</b> <b>illusion</b> is not enough to explain the mechanism underlying this Phillips curve. It requires two additional assumptions. First, prices respond differently to modified demand conditions: an increased aggregate demand exerts its influence on commodity prices sooner than it does on labour market prices. Therefore, the drop in unemployment is, after all, the result of decreasing real wages and an accurate judgement of the situation by employees is the only reason for the return to an initial (natural) rate of unemployment (i.e. the end of the <b>money</b> <b>illusion,</b> when they finally recognize the actual dynamics of prices and wages). The other (arbitrary) assumption refers to a special informational asymmetry: whatever employees are unaware of in connection with the changes in (real and nominal) wages and prices can be clearly observed by employers. The new classical version of the Phillips curve was aimed at removing the puzzling additional presumptions, but its mechanism still requires <b>money</b> <b>illusion.</b>|$|E

50|$|With {{the advent}} of talking pictures, variety suffered. For Bamberg it was a choice between doing a big show or nothing. In 1928, he was in Argentina trying to fill dates when Dante brought his show to Buenos Aires. For 120 performances, Dante filled the Casino theatre, which {{impressed}} a film-distributorship executive named Walter Gaulke. He saw how much <b>money</b> a big <b>illusion</b> could bring in.

40|$|Israel {{has known}} {{a very high}} {{inflation}} rate and two currency changes {{in the past five}} years. Coin size estimation by 97 subjects reveals a general tendency to underestimate sizes. The specific pattern of results suggests that coin size estimation is influenced by the subject’s attitude towards the coin in question, that inflation and actual value of the coin are not the only determinants of that attitude, and that the attitude remains unchanged if the coin is removed from circulation. Ever since Bruner and Goodman’s work (1947), it has been known that the size of coins, like that of other valuable objects, is usually overestimated. A number of experiments over the years have confirmed this view (McCurdy 1956; Tajfell 957; Dawson 1975). The exceedingly high rate of inflation in Israel over the past years (monthly double-digit rate) has created a novel phenomenon: the public has lost its trust in the local currency. The Israeli currency is no longer considered as a store of value, and in many circumstances loses even the functions of means of payment and of unit of account: many prices are expressed and advertised in US dollars, and actual payment is often performed with the US currency. Countless jokes circulate, poking fun at the local currency. These circumstances prompted us to investigate whether the classic <b>money</b> size <b>illusion</b> {{is to be found in}} Israel. Two recent studies bear upon this issue. Lea (1981) performed a small scale study in which subjects estimated the size of under their pre- and post-decimalization names. Lea’s own conclusio...|$|R
50|$|<b>Money</b> <b>illusion</b> {{can also}} {{influence}} people's perceptions of outcomes. Experiments {{have shown that}} people generally perceive an approximate 2% cut in nominal income with no change in monetary value as unfair, but see a 2% rise in nominal income where there is 4% inflation as fair, despite them being almost rational equivalents. This result {{is consistent with the}} 'Myopic Loss Aversion theory'. Furthermore, the <b>money</b> <b>illusion</b> means nominal changes in price can influence demand even if real prices have remained constant.|$|E

2500|$|How {{is money}} an abstraction? <b>Money</b> gives the <b>illusion</b> {{that it has}} a direct {{relationship}} to the work that is done. That is, the work one does is worth so much, equals so much money. In reality, however, the work one does is an expression of who one is as a person; it expresses one's goals in life and associated meaning. As a person, the work one performs is supposed to be an external realization of one's relationship to others and to the world. It is one's way of making {{the world a better place}} for oneself and for others. What reducing work to a monetary value does is to replace the concrete reality of one's everyday struggles with the world —to give it shape, form and meaning— with an abstraction. Kierkegaard lamented that [...] "a young man today would scarcely envy another his capacities or skill or the love of a beautiful girl or his fame, no, but he would envy him his money. Give me money, the young man will say, and I will be all right." [...] But Kierkegaard thinks this emphasis on money leads to a denial of the gifts of the spirit to those who are poor and in misery.|$|R

[...] Do not forget to do good and to share - Hebrews 13.16 - But do not forget either that this incessant talk by worldliness about beneficence and benevolence and generosity and charitable donations and gift upon gift is almost merciless. Ah, let the newspaper writers and tax collectors and parish beadles talk about generosity and count and count; but let us never ignore that Christianity speaks essentially of mercifulness, that Christianity would least of all be guilty of mercilessness, as if poverty and misery not only needed money etc. but also were excluded from the highest, from being able to be generous, beneficent, benevolent. But people prattle and prate ecclesiastically-worldly and worldly-ecclesiastically about generosity, beneficence-but forget, even in the sermon, mercifulness. Preaching should indeed be solely and only about mercifulness. If you know how to speak effectually about this, then generosity will follow of itself and come by itself accordingly as the individual is capable of it. But bear in mind, that if a person raised money, money, money by speaking about generosity-bear this in mind, that by being silent about mercifulness he would be acting mercilessly toward the poor and miserable person for whom he procured relief by means of the money of wealthy generosity. Bear this I mind, that if poverty and misery disturb us with their pleas, we can of course manage to get help for them through generosity; but bear this in mind, that it would be much more appalling if we constrained poverty and misery “to hinder our prayers,” as Scripture says (1 Peter 3:7), by grumbling against us to God-because we were atrociously unfair to poverty and misery by not telling that they are able to practice mercifulness. We shall now adhere to this point in this discourse about mercifulness and guard ourselves against confusing mercifulness with what is linked to external conditions, that is, what love as such does not have in its power, whereas it truly has mercifulness in its power just as surely as it has a heart in its bosom. It does not follow that because a person has a heart in his bosom he has money in his pocket, but the first is still more important and certainly is decisive with regard to mercifulness.

50|$|Along with Peter Diamond and Amos Tversky, Shafir is {{a proponent}} of the <b>Money</b> <b>illusion,</b> {{compiling}} empirical evidence {{for the existence of}} this effect, both in experiments and in real world situations.|$|E
50|$|The {{term was}} coined by Irving Fisher in Stabilizing the Dollar. It was popularized by John Maynard Keynes {{in the early}} twentieth century, and Irving Fisher wrote an {{important}} book on the subject, The <b>Money</b> <b>Illusion,</b> in 1928. The existence of <b>money</b> <b>illusion</b> is disputed by monetary economists who contend that people act rationally (i.e. think in real prices) with regard to their wealth. Eldar Shafir, Peter A. Diamond, and Amos Tversky (1997) have provided empirical evidence for the existence of the effect and it has been shown to affect behaviour in a variety of experimental and real-world situations.|$|E
50|$|Explanations of <b>money</b> <b>illusion</b> {{generally}} {{describe the}} phenomenon {{in terms of}} heuristics. Nominal prices provide a convenient rule of thumb for determining value and real prices are only calculated if they seem highly salient (e.g. in periods of hyperinflation or in long term contracts).|$|E
50|$|Economists such as Edmund Phelps reject {{this theory}} because {{it implies that}} workers suffer from <b>money</b> <b>illusion.</b> According to them, {{rational}} workers would only react to real wages, that is, inflation adjusted wages. However, one {{of the characteristics of}} a modern industrial economy is that workers do not encounter their employers in an atomized and perfect market. They operate in a complex combination of imperfect markets, monopolies, monopsonies, labor unions, and other institutions. In many cases, they may lack the bargaining power to act on their expectations, no matter how rational they are, or their perceptions, no matter how free of <b>money</b> <b>illusion</b> they are. It is not that high inflation causes low unemployment (as in Milton Friedman's theory) as much as vice versa: Low unemployment raises worker bargaining power, allowing them to successfully push for higher nominal wages. To protect profits, employers raise prices.|$|E
50|$|Chapter 4 {{presents}} evidence that, {{in contrast}} to monetarist theory, many people are at least partially under the <b>money</b> <b>illusion,</b> the tendency for people to ignore the effects of inflation. Workers for example will forgo a pay rise even when prices are rising, if they know that their firm is facing challenging conditions—but they are much less willing to accept a pay cut even when prices are falling.|$|E
5000|$|Some have {{suggested}} that <b>money</b> <b>illusion</b> implies that the negative relationship between inflation and unemployment described by the Phillips curve might hold, contrary to more recent macroeconomic theories such as the [...] "expectations-augmented Phillips curve". If workers use their nominal wage as a reference point when evaluating wage offers, firms can keep real wages relatively lower {{in a period of}} high inflation as workers accept the seemingly high nominal wage increase. These lower real wages would allow firms to hire more workers in periods of high inflation.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, for Wicksell the {{endogenous}} {{creation of}} money, {{and how it}} leads {{to changes in the}} real market (i.e. increased real aggregate demand) is fundamentally a breakdown of the neoclassical tradition of a dichotomy between the monetary and real sectors. Money is not a [...] "veil"—agents do react to it and this is not due to some irrational <b>money</b> <b>illusion.</b> However, for Wicksell, in the long run, the quantity theory still holds: money is still neutral in the long run, although to do so, we have broken the cherished neoclassical principles of dichotomy, money supply exogeneity and Say's law.|$|E
5000|$|Scott B. Sumner is the Director of the Program on Monetary Policy at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, a Research Fellow at the Independent Institute, and an {{economist}} {{who teaches at}} Bentley University in Waltham, Massachusetts. His economics blog, The <b>Money</b> <b>Illusion,</b> popularized the idea of nominal GDP targeting, which says that the Fed should target nominal GDP—i.e., real GDP growth plus the rate of inflation—to better [...] "induce the correct level of business investment". In May 2012, Chicago Fed President Charles L. Evans became the first sitting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to endorse the idea.|$|E
50|$|In economics, <b>money</b> <b>illusion,</b> or price illusion, {{refers to}} the {{tendency}} of people to think of currency in nominal, rather than real, terms. In other words, the numerical/face value (nominal value) of money is mistaken for its purchasing power (real value) at a previous point in the general price level (in the past). This is false, as modern fiat currencies have no intrinsic value and their real value is derived from all the underlying value systems in an economy, e.g., sound government, sound economics, sound education, sound legal system, sound defence, etc. The change in this real value over time is indicated by {{the change in the}} Consumer Price Index over time.|$|E
50|$|Adaptive {{expectations}} {{were instrumental in}} the Phillips curve outlined by Milton Friedman. For Friedman, workers form adaptive expectations, so the government can easily surprise them through unexpected monetary policy changes. As agents are trapped by the <b>money</b> <b>illusion,</b> {{they are unable to}} correctly perceive price and wage dynamics, so, for Friedman, unemployment can always be reduced through monetary expansions. The result is an increasing level of inflation if the government chooses to fix unemployment at a low rate {{for an extended period of}} time. However, in this framework it is clear why and how adaptive expectations are problematic. Agents are arbitrarily supposed to ignore sources of information which, otherwise, would affect their expectations. For example, government announcements are such sources: agents are expected to modify their expectations and break with the former trends when changes in economic policy necessitate it. This is the reason why the theory of adaptive expectations is often regarded as a deviation from the rational tradition of economics.|$|E
50|$|This {{behavior}} by agents {{is contrary to}} that which is assumed by much of economics. Economics has firm foundations in assumption of rationality, so the systematic errors made by agents in macroeconomic theory were considered unsatisfactory by Sargent and Wallace. More importantly, this behavior seemed inconsistent with the stagflation of the 1970s, when high inflation coincided with high unemployment, and attempts by policymakers to actively manage the economy in a Keynesian manner were largely counterproductive. When applying rational expectations within a macroeconomic framework, Sargent and Wallace produced the policy-ineffectiveness proposition, according to which the government could not successfully intervene in the economy if attempting to manipulate output. If the government employed monetary expansion {{in order to increase}} output, agents would foresee the effects, and wage and price expectations would be revised upwards accordingly. Real wages remain constant and therefore so does output, no <b>money</b> <b>illusion</b> occurs. Only stochastic shocks to the economy can cause deviations in employment from its natural level.|$|E
50|$|Many economists {{maintain}} that money neutrality {{is a good}} approximation for how the economy behaves {{over long periods of}} time but that in the short run monetary-disequilibrium theory applies, such that the nominal money supply would affect output. One argument is that prices and especially wages are sticky (because of menu costs, etc.), and cannot be adjusted immediately to an unexpected change in the money supply. An alternative explanation for real economic effects of money supply changes is not that people cannot change prices but that they do not realize that it is in their interest to do so. The bounded rationality approach suggests that small contractions in the money supply are not taken into account when individuals sell their houses or look for work, and that they will therefore spend longer searching for a completed contract than without the monetary contraction. Furthermore, the floor on nominal wages changes imposed by most companies is observed to be zero: an arbitrary number by the theory of monetary neutrality but a psychological threshold due to <b>money</b> <b>illusion.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Eldar Shafir's {{general area}} of {{research}} interest is decision making, especially behavioral economics: the study of how people make everyday decisions. Empirically based, his research draws from the fields of psychology and economics to {{support the view that}} decision making is often not based on what is assumed by rational agent models. [...] Shafir examines the effects of social, cognitive and emotional factors on economic decisions, such as the behavior of people who are in conflict and feel uncertainty when faced with making a decision. He is a proponent of the existence of the <b>money</b> <b>illusion</b> effect, the hypothesis that people tend to think of currency in nominal, rather than real, terms; People do not make rational financial decisions if they typically mistake the face value of money (its nominal value) for its purchasing power (real value), and this has implications for economic theory and public policy. In a series of empirical studies, Shafir, together with researchers Peter Diamond and Amos Tversky have provided evidence from experimental and real world situations that a number of factors such as cognitive biases affect decision making.|$|E
5000|$|It {{begins with}} a {{simplified}} case and generalises from it. An individual consumer has a given money income for spending on only two goods. What determines quantity demanded of each good by that individual? The basic hypothesis is the set of restrictions on the utility function and demand equilibrium that results as to the consumer's budget constraint. That hypothesis drives the theoretical outcome of a price change {{in one of the}} goods on the quantity demanded of each good. The book decomposes the change into the substitution effect and the income effect. The latter is the change in real income in theoretical terms without which the distinction between real and nominal values would be more problematic. The two effects are now standard in consumer theory. The analysis conforms with a proportionate change in money income and money prices of both goods leaving quantity demanded of both goods unchanged. This is also consistent with the distinction between real and nominal values and represents a common hypothesis in economics of no <b>money</b> <b>illusion.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Fisher {{believed}} that investors and savers - {{people in general}} - were afflicted in varying degrees by [...] "money illusion"; they could not see past {{the money to the}} goods the money could buy. In an ideal world, changes in the price level would have no effect on production or employment. In the actual world with <b>money</b> <b>illusion,</b> inflation (and deflation) did serious harm. For more than forty years, Fisher elaborated his vision of the damaging “dance of the dollar” and devised various schemes to “stabilize” money, i.e. to stabilize the price level. He {{was one of the first}} to subject macroeconomic data, including the money stock, interest rates, and the price level, to statistical analyses and tests. In the 1920s, he introduced the technique later called distributed lags. In 1973, the Journal of Political Economy posthumously reprinted his 1926 paper on the statistical relation between unemployment and inflation, retitling it as [...] "I discovered the Phillips curve". Index numbers played an important role in his monetary theory, and his book The Making of Index Numbers has remained influential down to the present day.|$|E
50|$|Neutrality {{of money}} has been a central {{question}} for monetarism. The most important answers were elaborated {{within the framework of}} the Phillips curve. Milton Friedman, assuming adaptive expectations, distinguished a series of short-run Phillips curves and a long-run one, where the short-run curves were supposed to be the conventional, negatively sloped curves, while the long-run curve was actually a vertical line indicating the natural rate of unemployment. According to Friedman, money was not neutral in the short run, because economic agents, confused by the <b>money</b> <b>illusion,</b> always respond to changes in the money supply. If the monetary authority chooses to increase the stock of money and, hence, the price level, agents will be never able to distinguish real and nominal changes, so they will regard the increase in nominal wages as real modifications, so labour supply will also be boosted. However, this change is only temporary, since agents will soon realize the actual state of affairs. As the higher wages were accompanied by higher prices, no real changes in income occurred, that is, it was no need to increase the labour supply. In the end, the economy, after this short detour, will return to the starting point, or in other words, to the natural rate of unemployment.|$|E
5000|$|Part of the {{attractiveness}} of areas is the cost-of-living. An area with a lower cost-of-living should be more attractive than areas with an expensive cost-of-living. Unfortunately, {{it is difficult to}} measure within countries cost-of-living. In an article published in 1983, Shah and Walker estimated a wage equation for male white workers in the UK using the general household survey of 1973 The cost-of-living proxy is taken from Reward Regional Surveys Ltd which publish reports on cost-of-living and regional comparisons from 1974 up to at least 1996 [...] The description of the construction of those cost-of-living is not clear.Wage differentials change and sometimes are reversed when they introduce the cost-of-living, Scotland and the South East of England are worse off when introducing cost-of-living compared to the Midlands regions. This result can be though of some evidence of the fact that differences in monetary reward {{are not the same as}} the differences in real-term awards. This suggests that the differences in wages between regions compensate at least partly for differences in cost-of-living. In 1991, Blackaby and Murphy estimated standardised geographical wage differentials and then explained these geographical wage differentials with a set of weather, environmental and prices indexes. The authors include other variables based on two other theories: efficiency wage and search theory. The results provide some evidence that workers are not suffering from <b>money</b> <b>illusion</b> as where areas with prices are higher by 10% than another area also have wages 10% higher. In consequence, wage do compensate for local differences in prices. In England, wages are usually thought of being better in the South than in the North of the country. Though Blackaby and Murphy show that wages when controlled for individual characteristics, occupations characteristics, cost-of-living and industry mix are better in the North than in the South for manual workers. Thus they conclude that it makes sense for unemployed in the North to wait and look for a job in the North as that is where they will get relatively better pay. This give some extra evidence that wage differentials compensate, at least partly, for geographical differences in cost-of-living.|$|E
40|$|Empirical and {{experimental}} evidence documents that <b>money</b> <b>illusion</b> is persistent and widespread.
