40|$|A {{new process}} has been {{developed}} by Du Pont for the commercial dyeing of nylon yarns, fabrics, garments and carpets. This process, called Infinity*, significantly reduces <b>mill</b> <b>dyeing</b> costs in many applications by shortening dyeing time, increasing dye yields and reducing {{the need for the}} chemical retarders and levelers which are often required in conventional dyeing procedures. INFINITY * is more environmentally friendly than conventional dyeing because it requires less dye and chemicals, yields a more completely exhausted dye bath, and in many cases, it uses less total energy and less water. INFINITY * consistently produces more uniform color and deeper shades than conventional dyeing, especially in those applications using critical acid and pre-metallized dyes...|$|R

50|$|A village arose {{around the}} mill, taking its name. It {{was home to}} over 450 people, of whom over half worked in the mill. Some {{residents}} immigrated from as far as Durham and Raleigh to find employment in Avalon. A few African-Americans also lived at {{the outskirts of the}} village and worked in the <b>mill's</b> <b>dye</b> house. In addition to the mill, the town consisted of a dam and artificial canal, 60 company houses, a boarding house, a hotel, a store, and a Moravian Church. Electricity came from a water-powered generator at the mill. No formal government was ever established in Avalon, so most events were either centered around the church or the mill.

The first Jura water correction (1868-91) diverted the Aare river into Lake Biel. This, together with the Lyssbach correction (1911-16) opened up extensive farm land along the old river.|$|R

40|$|Effluents of {{industrial}} wastewaters from oil refineries, paper <b>mills,</b> <b>dyes,</b> ceramic factories, resins, textiles and plastic contain {{high concentrations of}} aromatic compounds, which are toxic to organisms. Degradation of these compounds to tolerant limits before releasing them into the environment is an urgent requirement. Candida tropicalis yeast is an important representative of eucaryotic microorganisms {{that are able to}} utilize phenol. During the first phase of phenol biodegradation, cytoplasmatic NADPH-dependent phenol hydroxylase of C. tropicatis oxidizes phenol to catechol. Catechol is in the second phase of biodegradative process oxidized to cis,cis-muconic acid by the reaction catalyzed with catechol- 1, 2 -dioxygenase. In this diploma thesis we investigated the effect of the heavy metal ions on NADPH-dependent phenol hydroxylase and catechol- 1, 2 -dioxygenase of C. tropicalis. Phenol hydroxylase was inhibited by Cu 2 + and Pb 2 + ions. Catechol dioxygenase was inhibited by all substances containing heavy metal ions (Fe 2 +, Mn 2 +, Cd 2 +, Cu 2 + and Pb 2 +), which were tested in this work. The most effective inhibition was produced by Pb 2 + followed by Mn 2 +, Cd 2 + Fe 2 + and Cu 2 + ions. The higher sensitivity of catechol- 1, 2 -dioxygenase to heavy metal ions might follow from the presence of histidine residue [...] ...|$|R
