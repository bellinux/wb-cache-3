5|$|Another {{reform was}} that Austria, having lost many officers, veteran and elite troops, and regulars, {{and unable to}} call on allies, embraced the Levée en <b>masse</b> used earlier by the French. By this time, the French were moving from the Levée en <b>masse</b> in favour of forming a regular army based on a core of battle-hardened and elite veterans. In a strange {{reversal}} of the earlier Napoleonic Wars, where Frenchmen with little experience and often pressed into service fought against the professional Austrian army, a massive amount of Austrian conscripts, with no experience and only basic training and equipment would be sent into the field against a highly trained, campaign-hardened, and well-equipped French Grande Armée.|$|E
5|$|In Nepal, animal {{sacrifice}} en <b>masse</b> {{occurs during}} the three-day-long Gadhimai festival. In 2009 it was speculated {{that more than}} 250,000 animals were sacrificed during this event.|$|E
5|$|On June 9, 2011, a {{group of}} Gingrich's senior {{campaign}} aides left the campaign en <b>masse,</b> leading to doubts about the viability of his presidential run. On June 21, 2011, two more senior aides left.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth metal {{has been}} known since ancient times, {{although}} it was often confused with lead and tin, which share some physical properties. The etymology is uncertain, but possibly comes from Arabic bi ismid, meaning having the properties of antimony or the German words weiße <b>Masse</b> or Wismuth ("white mass"), translated in the mid-sixteenth century to New Latin bisemutum.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar was {{subjected}} to several more sieges before its final fall on 20 August 1462 (feast of St. Bernard) to Christian forces under the 1st Duke of Medina Sidonia. The population, Muslim and Jewish, was expelled en <b>masse</b> and replaced by Christian settlers.|$|E
5|$|In October 2009, {{eleven of}} the local councillors {{resigned}} en <b>masse,</b> citing excessive criticism from local residents and in particular criticism from a hostile local weblog. In February 2012 the External Auditor appointed by the Audit Commission published a critical Report in the Public Interest regarding the activities of Somerton Town Council {{in the fiscal year}} 2008 to 2009.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa, ants {{are used}} to help harvest rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which are small seeds {{used to make a}} herbal tea. The plant disperses its seeds widely, making manual {{collection}} difficult. Black ants collect and store these and other seeds in their nest, where humans can gather them en <b>masse.</b> Up to half a pound (200g) of seeds may be collected from one ant-heap.|$|E
5|$|Since 1902, Canadian {{undergraduate}} {{students have been}} eligible for Rhodes Scholarships to study at the University of Oxford. Since then, McGill students have won 142 Rhodes Scholarships – {{more than any other}} Canadian University. These students include parliamentary and cabinet ministers David Lewis (1932), Alastair Gillespie (1947), and Marcel <b>Massé</b> (1963), and political philosopher Charles Taylor (1952).|$|E
5|$|Tablighi ethic discourages social {{engagement}} or participation {{with some}} non-orthodox customary and ceremonial rituals {{which are usually}} extravagantly followed in South Asia. For example, marriages are performed en <b>masse</b> at annual congregations and other similar mass meetings, so that the costly celebrations common in South Asia are avoided.|$|E
5|$|That was {{the first}} time a Commission had been forced to resign en <b>masse</b> and {{represented}} a shift of power towards the Parliament. However the Santer Commission did carry out work on the Amsterdam Treaty and the euro. In response to the scandal the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) was created.|$|E
5|$|The M9 started {{production}} in August 1942, at IH. The M9 and M9A1 were manufactured en <b>masse</b> and 2,026 were produced in total. According to American military historian and defense specialist Steven Zaloga, 2,026 M9 and 1,407 M9A1 were produced in 1943.|$|E
5|$|With {{the start}} of {{military}} operations in Croatia, Croats {{and a number of}} Serbian conscripts started to desert the JNA en <b>masse,</b> similar to what had happened in Slovenia. Albanians and Macedonians started to search for a way to legally leave the JNA or serve their conscription term in Macedonia; these moves further homogenized the ethnic composition of JNA troops in or near Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Another novel {{aspect of}} the {{offensive}} used by the attackers, which was extensively commented upon by American journalist Timothy Turner who was observing the battle from El Paso, was the rotation of troops that the rebels employed. Rather than attacking en <b>masse</b> with the whole army, Villa and Orozco had their soldiers engage the enemy for a few hours, {{then go back to}} secure positions to sleep, while other rebels took their place. As a consequence the rebel troops were always rested while the less numerous defending federal troops were forced to remain sleepless and ever vigilant.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the largest}} open spaces close to Manchester, the moor has a history of use for army {{manoeuvres}} and large public gatherings. In his book The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, Friedrich Engels referred to it as the Mons Sacer of Manchester. This was a reference to the hill to which the plebs (common citizens) of Rome withdrew en <b>masse</b> in 494 BC as an act of civil protest.|$|E
5|$|During the Hundred Years' War, {{the army}} of King Edward III besieged Calais, and Edward ordered that the town's {{population}} be killed en <b>masse.</b> He agreed to spare them if six of the principal citizens would come to him prepared to die, bareheaded and barefooted and with ropes around their necks. When they came, he ordered that they be executed, but pardoned them when his queen, Philippa of Hainault, begged him to spare their lives. The Burghers of Calais depicts the men as they are leaving for the king's camp, carrying keys to the town's gates and citadel.|$|E
5|$|In 1502, {{the whole}} Muslim {{community}} of Teruel (part of Aragon bordered with Castile) converted en <b>masse</b> to Christianity, {{even though the}} 1502 edict of conversion for Castilian Muslims {{did not apply to}} them. Harvey suggested that they were pressured by the Castilians across the border, but historian Trevor Dadson argued that this conversion was unforced, caused instead by centuries of contact with their Christian neighbors and a desire for an equal status with the Christians.|$|E
5|$|In September, Serbian troops {{completely}} {{surrounded the}} city of Vukovar. Croatian troops, including the 204th Vukovar Brigade, entrenched themselves within the city and held their ground against elite armored and mechanized brigades of the JNA, as well as Serb paramilitary units. Vukovar was almost completely devastated; 15,000 houses were destroyed. Some ethnic Croatian civilians had taken shelter inside the city. Other members of the civilian population fled the area en <b>masse.</b> Death toll estimates for Vukovar {{as a result of}} the siege range from 1,798 to 5,000. A further 22,000 were exiled from Vukovar immediately after the town was captured.|$|E
5|$|Leo {{intends to}} kill Quatermass {{to prevent the}} {{destruction}} of the asteroid, and also to allow the ammonids to travel back to Earth en <b>masse</b> in the Quatermass II. He tries to kill Quatermass with a gun, but the recoil sends him floating helplessly off into space. Quatermass returns to the rocket and jettisons the nuclear motor, then flies the rocket back to earth as the motor blows up the asteroid, killing the remaining ammonids and relinquishing control over Dillon and all the 'marked' humans, returning mankind to its former freedom.|$|E
5|$|Mass escapes were rare. One of the {{few that}} succeeded took place on 2October 1961, when 53people from the border village of Böseckendorf– {{a quarter of the}} village's population– escaped en <b>masse,</b> {{followed}} by another 13inhabitants in February 1963. An unusual mass escape occurred in September 1964 when 14East Germans, including 11 children, were smuggled across the border in a refrigerated truck. They were able to escape detection by being concealed under the carcasses of slaughtered pigs being transported to the West.|$|E
5|$|Moorish {{rule over}} Gibraltar {{came to an}} end in August 1462 when a small Castilian force under the command of Alonso de Arcos, the {{governor}} of Tarifa, launched a surprise attack. The Castilians mounted their attack while Gibraltar's senior commanders and townspeople were away paying homage to the new sultan of Granada. After a short assault which inflicted heavy losses on the defenders, the garrison surrendered to Enrique de Guzmán's son Juan Alonso, now the first Duke of Medina Sidonia. The Moorish inhabitants were once again expelled en <b>masse,</b> to be replaced by Christians.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 1944, the SS {{cleared the}} Gypsy camp. A witness {{in another part}} of the camp later told of the Gypsies unsuccessfully battling the SS with improvised weapons before being loaded into trucks. The {{surviving}} population (estimated at 2,897 to 5,600) was then killed en <b>masse</b> in the gas chambers. The murder of the Romani people by the Nazis during World War II is known in the Romani language as the Porajmos (devouring).|$|E
5|$|On 20 February 1988, the Nagorno-Karabakh Supreme Council (the {{regional}} legislature) {{issued a}} request to transfer the region from Soviet Azerbaijan to Soviet Armenia. The Moscow government declined the claims, while {{hundreds of thousands of}} people demonstrated in Yerevan in support of the idea. Few days later, on 26 February, an anti-Armenian pogrom broke out in the Azerbaijani seaside industrial city Sumgait, forcing thousands of Armenians to leave Azerbaijan en <b>masse.</b>|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2010, Dunderdale {{along with}} Ministers Kennedy and Marshall joined the NLMA {{president}} {{to announce that}} a tentative agreement between the provincial government and doctors had been reached. The offer included 100percent Atlantic Canadian parity within {{the first two years}} of the agreement, pay equity for salaried specialists, and retention bonuses for fee-for-service rural physicians. As a result of the new deal, the 13 of the 14 doctors who tendered their resignations en <b>masse</b> in November rescinded their resignations.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{scholars}} have emphasised, {{in the words}} of Ármann Jakobsson, that:the time has come to resist reviewing information about álfar en <b>masse</b> and trying to impose generalizations on a tradition of a thousand years. Legends of álfar may have been constantly changing and were perhaps always heterogeneous so it might be argued that any particular source will only reflect the state of affairs at one given time.Thus, elves have had a place both within and outside Germanic-speaking Christian cultures.|$|E
5|$|The 25 May saw {{the first}} major Soviet attempt to break the encirclement. German Major General Hubert Lanz {{described}} the attacks as gruesome, made en <b>masse.</b> By 26 May, the surviving Red Army soldiers were forced into crowded positions {{in an area of}} roughly fifteen square kilometers. Soviet attempts to break into the German encirclement from the east were continuously blocked using tenacious defensive manoeuvres and German air power. Groups of Soviet tanks and infantry that attempted to escape and succeeded in breaking through German lines were caught and destroyed by Ju 87s from StG 77.|$|E
5|$|The Condor Legion {{also took}} part in the Battle of Brunete. The Legion was sent from the north to {{reinforce}} the broken line. There were repeated raids on Spanish Republican Army armoured vehicles and later defensive positions by both bombers and fighters based at Salamanca. Spanish Republican Air Force aircraft were ineffective, despite Nationalist fears, compared with German aircraft. The Legion lost eight aircraft, but claimed 18 victories. German tactics were also improved with the experience of Brunete, particularly the en <b>masse</b> use of tanks by the Nationalists.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament {{gained more}} powers from {{successive}} treaties, namely through {{the extension of}} the ordinary legislative procedure (then called the codecision procedure), and in 1999, the Parliament forced the resignation of the Santer Commission. The Parliament had refused to approve the Community budget over allegations of fraud and mis-management in the Commission. The two main parties took on a government-opposition dynamic for the first time during the crisis which ended in the Commission resigning en <b>masse,</b> the first of any forced resignation, {{in the face of an}} impending censure from the Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The SEC {{announced}} it had filed civil fraud complaints against Andersen. A few days later, sources claimed Enron and Dynegy were renegotiating {{the terms of}} their arrangement. Dynegy now demanded Enron agree to be bought for $4 billion rather than the previous $8 billion. Observers were reporting difficulties in ascertaining which of Enron's operations, if any, were profitable. Reports described an en <b>masse</b> shift of business to Enron's competitors {{for the sake of}} risk exposure reduction.|$|E
5|$|The {{failures}} of these titles were further compounded by Atari's business dealings from 1981. Confident in strong sales, {{the company had}} told its distributors to place their 1982 orders all at once. However, video game sales in 1982 had slowed, and distributors who had ordered en <b>masse</b> in expectation of high turnover were left to simply return large quantities of unsold stock to Atari. As a result, the company soon found itself in possession of several million essentially useless video game cartridges, which it would be entirely unable to sell.|$|E
5|$|The {{general strike}} of 1950 {{began in the}} coal mining centres of Hainaut and quickly spread. Workers were soon on strike across Wallonia, Brussels, and, to a lesser extent, Flanders. The port of Antwerp {{was one of the}} key sites {{affected}} and the country was virtually paralysed. On 30 July, four workers were shot dead by the Gendarmerie at Grâce-Berleur, near Liège and the violence intensified. Staunch Leopoldists in the Government called for a stronger stance but found themselves in a minority, even in the PSC–CVP. Frustrated at the lack of progress, the Government threatened to resign en <b>masse.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{theory that}} Custer's {{soldiers}} committed suicide en <b>masse</b> {{toward the end}} of the Battle of the Little Bighorn has been controversial from the moment it was first suggested, and the discussion continues. The notion was so controversial that Marquis could not find a publisher for Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself, his main vehicle for promoting the theory, and the book did not appear in print until 1976, forty years after his death.|$|E
5|$|While {{no studies}} have {{established}} {{whether or not}} these ants contain alarm pheromones, its relative Myrmecia gulosa is capable of inducing territorial alarm using pheromones. If proven, this would explain their ability to attack en <b>masse.</b> Foraging workers are regularly observed on the inflorescences of Prasophyllum alpinum (mostly pollinated by wasps of the subfamily Ichneumonidae). Although pollinia are often seen in the ants' jaw, they have a habit of cleaning their mandibles on the leaves and stems of nectar-rich plants before moving on, preventing pollen exchange. It is unknown whether jack jumper ants contribute to pollination.|$|E
5|$|A second {{strategy}} was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Allies, despite the overwhelming number of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual {{strategy was}} adopted by the congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while the women and children of Athens were evacuated en <b>masse</b> to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E
5|$|Although {{ultimately}} {{the number of}} men that joined the units of the 2nd AIF from the Militia was in fact lower than anticipated, a large number of such personnel left to seek an opportunity to serve overseas. In this time the 61st Battalion lost many of its experienced senior officers and non-commissioned officers to the 2/25th and 2/33rd Battalions that were raised in Queensland, {{as well as to the}} Royal Australian Air Force. Of note was the loss of the battalion's pipe and drum band, which joined the 2/25th en <b>masse.</b> A 61st Battalion officer, Major Charles Withy, also went across with them serving initially as the second in command and then later as the 2/25th's commanding officer.|$|E
