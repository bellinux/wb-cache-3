A large PDS tornado watch with very high tornado probabilities was issued that afternoon for that same area. Widespread tornado warnings were issued in that area later that evening.|$|E

Depending of the vehicle capabilities, the break-even price of E85 has to be between 25 and 30% lower than gasoline.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the storm, gale warnings were issued on August 19 from Jacksonville, Florida to Virginia Beach, Virginia. A hurricane watch was also posted between Savannah, Georgia and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The hurricane watch was later extended to Jacksonville when conditions appeared <b>more</b> <b>favorable</b> for the storm's intensification, but was soon discontinued. Flooding rains were anticipated in the Carolinas, though, in contrast, Dottie was compared to a mere thunderstorm by some local officials.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eastern}} Pacific, Category5 hurricanes usually occur only in El Niño years. During El Niño years, {{conditions}} are <b>more</b> <b>favorable</b> for tropical cyclones because of warmer sea surface temperatures and reduced wind shear.

5|$|Internal {{migration}} was likewise {{instrumental in}} the development of the new domains emerging in former royal lands. The new landholders granted personal freedom and <b>more</b> <b>favorable</b> financial conditions to those who arrived in their estates, which also enabled the peasants who decided not to move to improve their position. BélaIV granted privileges to more than a dozen towns, including Nagyszombat (Trnava, Slovakia) and Pest.|$|E

5|$|Opening to mixed reviews, Manhunter fared poorly at the {{box office}} {{at the time of its}} release, making only $8.6 million in the United States.

Its resurgent popularity, which may be due to later adaptations of Harris' books and Petersen's success in , has seen it labelled as a cult film.|$|E

5|$|A trough {{developed}} {{along the}} northeast monsoon on 25October 2015 off the southwest coast of India, {{consisting of a}} fragmented area of convection, or thunderstorms. The system was located within an environment of moderate wind shear, which prevented early development, although conditions were anticipated to become <b>more</b> <b>favorable.</b> On 26October, the system developed a distinct low pressure area. The low gradually consolidated, and the circulation became better defined, amplified by decreasing wind shear and good outflow {{to the north and}} south. At 03:00UTC on 28October, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as a depression. Nine hours later, the agency upgraded it further to a deep depression, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 04A at 21:00UTC.|$|E
5|$|A weather system {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September3. The {{disturbance}} was small and became unidentifiable within 24hours of formation. Satellite imagery indicated that the disturbance may have acquired a circulation on September7, but the circulation was gone by the next day. The remaining tropical wave moved into the Lesser Antilles on September11 and a reconnaissance aircraft was deployed. The aircraft found circulation; however, by the next day, only a strong wave was detected. Atmospheric conditions became <b>more</b> <b>favorable</b> for development, yielding lower wind shear near Hispaniola for several days. The system moved into this area as the latest Reconnaissance aircraft was deployed, declaring it a tropical depression on September13 near the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|An upper-level {{anticyclone}} {{north of}} the system provided a <b>more</b> <b>favorable</b> environment for organization, allowing the convection to organize into banding features. The system also developed good outflow, though initially the surface circulation was too elongated {{for it to be}} considered a tropical cyclone. Early on June3, the nearby anticyclone moved northeastward, which increased wind shear over the system and caused it briefly to become less-organized. However, convection increased over the center, and at 1500UTC on June3 the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Two-E about 140mi (240km) southwest of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero; the upgrade was due to the system developing sufficiently organized convection, as well as a closed surface circulation.|$|E

5|$|As the day wore on, {{conditions}} {{appeared more}} and <b>more</b> <b>favorable</b> for thunderstorms, {{and more and}} more similar to the events of March 20. Weather radar images showed a severe squall line had formed to the west, and weather stations to the west reported cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms. In an afternoon meeting, under some pressure from their commanding officer, base meteorologists composed and issued the first official tornado forecast. Although they were aware of the small chance of success, they felt they had no choice, since the conditions were so similar to March 20. Equipment which could be was moved to bomb-proof shelters, and base personnel were moved to safer areas.|$|E
5|$|At the 500hPa level, the air {{temperature}} averages −7°C (18°F) within the tropics, but {{air in the}} tropics is normally dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, to a <b>more</b> <b>favorable</b> temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500hPa in a tropical atmosphere of −13.2°C is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is 26.5°C, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1°C in the sea surface temperature for each 1°C change at 500hpa.|$|E
