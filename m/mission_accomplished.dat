25|$|For {{outstanding}} {{and heroic}} accomplishment {{above and beyond}} the call of duty as commanding officer of the 1st Marine Division in operations against enemy Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands during the period August 7, to December 9, 1942. With the adverse factors of weather, terrain, and disease making his task a difficult and hazardous undertaking, and with his command eventually including sea, land, and air forces of Army, Navy and Marine Corps, Major General Vandegrift achieved marked success in commanding the initial landings of the United States forces in the Solomon Islands and in their subsequent occupation. His tenacity, courage, and resourcefulness prevailed against a strong, determined, and experienced enemy, and the gallant fighting spirit of the men under his inspiring leadership enabled them to withstand aerial, land, and sea bombardment, to surmount all obstacles, and leave a disorganized and ravaged enemy. This dangerous but vital <b>mission,</b> <b>accomplished</b> at the constant risk of his life, resulted in securing a valuable base for further operations of our forces against the enemy, and its successful completion reflects great credit upon Major General Vandegrift, his command, and the United States Naval Service.|$|E

500|$|The {{rationale}} behind Asda's initial press release remains uncertain. [...] Neill Denny, commentator for thebookseller.com, opined that [...] "the whole episode has the whiff of a badly-conceived PR stunt by ill-briefed senior executives at Asda {{out of touch}} with the subtleties of the book world." [...] Ralph Baxter of Publishing News concurred: [...] "For Asda... it may be seen as <b>mission</b> <b>accomplished,</b> a high-risk strategy to maximise publicity for its Harry Potter offer rewarded with television, radio, Internet and newspaper coverage.

(The plot mirrored the critical tune-up, with a cranky internal affairs agent conducting an audit on Fringe division.)

500|$|Conversely, Andy Webster of The New York Times said, [...] "Its bargain-basement {{production}} {{values and}} lack of wit unexpectedly prove a greater liability than an asset". Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times criticized its characters, costumes, and dialogue; he said it [...] "so desperately wants to be cultishly admired...that it forgets to be genuinely offbeat or funny". Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, mentioning the influences of John Carpenter, The Warriors, Mad Max 2, and A Clockwork Orange, and criticizing Jason Trost's performance. He said the film was [...] "a junky, disposable lark, created for a midnight audience to swallow, belch, and forget about the next morning". Nick Schager of Slant Magazine gave it 1½ stars out of 4, and called it a [...] "humorless void" [...] and a [...] "wannabe cult hit". Eric Hynes of The Village Voice said, [...] "the film's charm fades fast" [...] and , [...] "he problem with paying such dogged homage to shitty movies is that integrity is best achieved by producing a shitty movie in turn. <b>Mission</b> <b>accomplished,</b> for whatever that's worth." [...] Ethan Gilsdorf of The Boston Globe gave the film 1 star out of 4, saying it was not [...] "obliviously dreadful enough to be 'so bad it's good'". Christy Lemire of the Associated Press echoed this opinion, giving it 1 star out of 4; she said the film is [...] "just plain badand boring, and repetitive" [...] and that [...] "as comedy, it just feels numbing". Max Nicholson of IGN said the film [...] "is {{by no means the}} worst thing I've ever seen", but that it [...] "should have been a three-minute sketch on Funny or Die".|$|E
500|$|Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times, in {{reference}} to Hannah Montana, commented, [...] "Once again, make-believe Miley was more compelling than the real thing." [...] Wood believed Cyrus possessed charisma, commenting that she portrayed superstar authority, but failed because she was {{unable or unwilling to}} [...] "give her fans a deeper idea of who she is and what her music means. For all its eye-popping detail, the concert offered nothing that viewers of her TV show or buyers of her records don't already know about her." [...] Dave Paulson of The Tennessean stated, [...] "Cyrus' spectacle sets her apart from nearly every other A-list act touring today. She's not a renowned vocalist by any stretch, but her show's choreography barely provides a moment for her to catch her breath, and she's still able to deliver." [...] Michael Hann of the United Kingdom-based Guardian was impressed by the concert, praising the setlist and deeming it enjoyable for both children and adults. He continued, [...] "Good as the best songs are, though, they take a backseat to the staging [...] The one misstep is when a trailer for her next movie is shown during a costume change. It's a tacky moment and doesn't reflect the attention to detail that makes the rest of it a laugh-out-loud delight." [...] Lael Loewenstein of Variety magazine said, [...] "Cyrus knows how to deliver the goods without losing her core audience." [...] Loewenstein deemed the concert a <b>mission</b> <b>accomplished</b> because of inevitable hits and Cyrus' charisma, drive, spunk, and a merely-limited vocal range. Erik Ensrst of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel praised the show, stating that it was [...] "a pure visual spectacle", but commented that producers forgot a place for Cyrus' personality.|$|E

2500|$|Varietys Maureen Ryan, who {{expected}} Lexa {{to eventually}} die, and called Clarke and Lexa's love and deathbed scenes spectacular, said the season had been rushed and Lexa's death after sex with Clarke [...] "was {{another case of}} the show compressing a timeline to an unfortunate degree." [...] Ryan argued that the way a character dies matters, particularly for LGBTQ characters, given their under-representation and misrepresentation in the media. She listed scenarios with pros and cons about how the show might have better played out the Lexa factor, including the suggestion of Lexa never being in season 3. While Bethonie Butler of The Washington Post stated {{that part of what}} fueled the outrage is that The 100 was thought to be [...] "progressive in its treatment of LGBT characters," [...] and so the death led to feelings of betrayal, Hypable.com's Selina Wilken said that [...] "Season 3 did a lot to build Lexa up before her fall, turning her into an almost King Arthur-like figure of salvation in this broken world, at least partly in an effort to blind-sight and devastate the audience when she died. (And... <b>mission</b> <b>accomplished,</b> all too well.)" [...] Butler added, [...] "The controversy reveals the pitfalls of a show misunderstanding its audience and the politics of minority representation onscreen." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{four days}} sailing a gale forced Marion to seek shelter at Godhavn where {{the crew was}} granted liberty. To Smith's {{surprise}} diesel fuel was available {{and he took the}} opportunity to fill the ship's fuel tanks. With the unexpected acquisition of fuel, when Marion departed Godhavn, she was able to do so on both engines. After completing a line of sample stations to the north, she returned to top off fuel and water tanks before heading across to Baffin Bay, all the while taking soundings and samples. Samples were taken along the coast of Baffin Island and a [...] line across Davis Strait during the month of August ending at Ivigtut, the site of a cryolite mine that was Greenland's main source of income during that period. After re-provisioning and fueling, she headed back to sea only to be forced to shelter under Mount Kungmat for three days before departing Cape Farewell on a [...] station line to Belle Isle. A storm prevented entering the Strait of Belle Isle so Smith decided to put in at St. John's, Newfoundland, for a liberty and supplies. While en route, Smith managed to run two unscheduled station lines along the Newfoundland coastal shelf. Marion arrived at St. John's on 11 September and departed for New London the next day, her scientific <b>mission</b> <b>accomplished.</b> She arrived at New London on 19 September 1928 after having traveled [...] and taken observations at 191 oceanographic stations with some 2,000 observations of temperature and salinity. Numerous bottom samples had been taken and soundings were added to the charts of the area. The Marion expedition observations demonstrated that pack ice had a direct influence on the drift of icebergs. Heavy pack ice along the Newfoundland and Labrador shelf waters prevented icebergs from being carried to shore and forced them to enter shipping lanes to the south. Little ice on the shelves allowed the icebergs to ground on the Newfoundland coast, where they were harmless. The expedition {{was the beginning of a}} long involvement by the Coast Guard in Greenland and its surrounding waters.|$|E
