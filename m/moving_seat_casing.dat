40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{operating}} noise performance of a seat adjuster mechanism, benchmarking measurements were conducted in different cars for six and eight types of seat adjustment operation. The six types of operation include: <b>seat</b> <b>moving</b> up, <b>seat</b> <b>moving</b> down, <b>seat</b> front end up, seat front end down, seat rear end up and seat rear end down. The eight types of operation include: <b>seat</b> <b>moving</b> forward, <b>seat</b> <b>moving</b> backward, <b>seat</b> <b>moving</b> up, <b>seat</b> <b>moving</b> down, <b>seat</b> front end up, seat front end down, seat rear end up and seat rear end down. The noise and vibration levels, sound quality and root causes of the noise problem have been analysed and discussed in this paper. The noise characteristics have been identified, and the psychoacoustic parameters {{have been used to}} quantify sound quality of the seat adjuster. The objective assessment results have been found to match well with subjective evaluation results...|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of car seat has been {{designed}} in which the back-rest is able to move freely in the vertical direction. The design allows the back-rest to follow the vertical vibration {{of the back of}} an occupant of the seat. This is intended to decrease any strain on the lumbar part of the spinal column caused by a different vertical motion at the seat squab and the seat back. The transmission of vertical (z axis) vibration from the base of this seat to the seat surface, to the back-rest and to the backs and heads of seat occupants has been measured. Measurements were made with the seat back fixed, to prevent vertical motion relative to the seat frame, and with the seat back free to move. Vibration transmissibilities from the seat base to the seat surface were characterized by a resonance at frequencies in the region of 4 Hz. The resonance frequencies were slightly higher with the fixed back-rest than with the moving back-rest. The transmissibilities at frequencies above 4 Hz -were generally higher with the fixed back-rest. Measurements with no contact between the seat occupants and the seat back indicated that the dynamic properties of the human body and the seat cushion were less influenced by the <b>moving</b> <b>seat</b> back than by the fixed seat back. Differential motion between the seat surface and seat back was smaller with the <b>moving</b> <b>seat</b> back than with the fixed back. © IMechE 1996. </p...|$|R
