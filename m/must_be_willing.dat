Initially, glaucoma drops may reasonably be started in either one or in both eyes. Wiping the eye with an absorbent pad after the administration of eye drops may result in fewer adverse effects, like the growth of eyelashes and hyperpigmentation in the eyelid.|$|E

Blood clots and biliary problems have the possibility of arising in the donor post-op, but these issues are remedied fairly easily. Although death is a risk that a living donor <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to accept prior to the surgery, the mortality rate of living donors in the United States is low. The LDLT donor's immune system does diminish {{as a result of}} the liver regenerating, so certain foods which would normally cause an upset stomach could cause serious illness.|$|E
25|$|Management which models {{the use of}} {{articulated}} dissent {{contributes to}} the use of articulated dissent among its employees (Kassing & Avtgis, 1999). Subordinates who witness their supervisors successfully articulating dissent may be more likely and more willing to adopt similar strategies. However, a supervisor must keep in mind that expressing dissent can be very difficult and uncomfortable for lower-level managers and employees. Therefore, supervisors should not only take actions to encourage dissent, they <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to seek out individuals willing to say no to them (Roberto, 2005).|$|E

25|$|When {{determining}} if {{an outcome}} has been achieved, assessments may become too mechanical, looking {{only to see}} if the student has acquired the knowledge. The ability to use and apply the knowledge in different ways may not be the focus of the assessment. The focus on determining if the outcome has been achieved leads to a loss of understanding and learning for students, who may never be shown how to use the knowledge they have gained. Instructors are faced with a challenge: they must learn to manage an environment that can become fundamentally different from what they are accustomed to. In regards to giving assessments, they <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to put in the time required to create a valid, reliable assessment that ideally would allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the information, while remaining objective.|$|E
25|$|This diagram shows a {{productive}} {{use of space}} by West Germany in the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final which led to Gerd Müller's game-winning goal against the Netherlands. German midfielder Rainer Bonhof made a long diagonal run out {{to the right side}} of the field, putting put him clear of the Dutch opposition. Deep into the Dutch half, Bonhof received a ball from Jürgen Grabowski and beat Arie Haan. Bonhof sent a low cross in to Müller, who found the back of the net. Moving diagonally is one of the best offensive movements, whether at the near or far posts, or out to the wings farther back in midfield. Diagonal movement creates added space to maneuver, compared to simply running straight ahead or laterally. It also means that players <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to switch positions as the situation demands.|$|E

He ordered his dragoons to take a bridge; they failed and suffered severe casualties. D'Hautpoul and his cuirassiers—heavy cavalry of big men on big horses—thundered over the bridge and scattered the Russian rear guard. As the retreating infantry fled, d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers captured four guns and two standards. Napoleon was so pleased with d'Hautpoul and his cuirassiers that he embraced the six-foot man in front of his division the next day. In his own turn, d'Hautpoul was so pleased that he announced first, to have such a compliment, he <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to die for his emperor, and second, to his troops: [...] "The Emperor has embraced me on behalf of all of you.

2500|$|Snow shoeing – A snowshoe is {{footwear}} {{for walking}} over the snow. Snowshoes work by distributing {{the weight of}} the person over a larger area so that the person's foot does not sink completely into the snow, a quality called [...] "flotation". It is often said by snowshoers that if you can walk, you can snowshoe. This is true in optimal conditions, but snowshoeing properly requires some slight adjustments to walking. The method of walking is to lift the shoes slightly and slide the inner edges over each other, thus avoiding the unnatural and fatiguing [...] "straddle-gait" [...] that would otherwise be necessary. A snowshoer <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to roll his or her feet slightly as well. An exaggerated stride works best when starting out, particularly with larger or traditional shoes.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{unsuccessful}} BPR attempts {{may have}} been due to the confusion surrounding BPR, and how it should be performed. [...] Organizations were well aware that changes needed to be made, but did not know which areas to change or how to change them. [...] As a result, process reengineering is a management concept that has been formed by trial and error or, in other words, practical experience. As more and more businesses reengineer their processes, knowledge of what caused the successes or failures is becoming apparent. [...] To reap lasting benefits, companies <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to examine how strategy and reengineering complement each other by learning to quantify strategy in terms of cost, milestones, and timetables, by accepting ownership of the strategy throughout the organization, by assessing the organization’s current capabilities and process realistically, and by linking strategy to the budgeting process. [...] Otherwise, BPR is only a short-term efficiency exercise.|$|E
2500|$|The Triffin dilemma or Triffin {{paradox is}} the {{conflict}} of economic interests that arises between short-term domestic and long-term international objectives for countries whose currencies serve as global reserve currencies. This dilemma was first identified in a 1929 book, Gold and Central Banks, by Polish economist Feliks Młynarski, who identified a fundamental instability in a gold-based international monetary system, that the reserve currency countries would tend to accumulate foreign reserves, but as the volume of these grew relative to the country's gold reserves, international investors would begin to fear suspension of convertibility; later in the 1960s, it was rediscovered {{in the context of}} the Bretton Woods system by Belgian-American economist Robert Triffin, who pointed out that the country whose currency, being the global reserve currency, foreign nations wish to hold, <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to supply the world with an extra supply of its currency to fulfill world demand for these foreign exchange reserves, thus leading to a trade deficit. Due to Młynarski's precedence in articulating the problem, Barry Eichengreen has suggested renaming the problem to [...] "the Młynarski dilemma".|$|E
2500|$|Gates' tenure {{with the}} Obama {{administration}} included a huge shift in military spending. [...] In April 2009, Gates proposed a large shift in budget priorities in the U.S. Department of Defense 2010 budget. The budget cuts included many programs geared toward conventional warfare, {{such as the}} end of new orders of the F-22 Raptor, and further development of Future Combat Systems manned vehicles. However, these cuts were counterbalanced by increases in funding for programs like the special forces. Gates called this the [...] "nation's first truly 21st century defense budget." [...] In late April 2010, he suggested the Navy cease funding development of a new multibillion-dollar ballistic missile submarine program on the grounds of cost and relevancy. He has suggested the {{hundreds of billions of dollars}} would be better spent on a new generation of vessels tailored to the threats and tactics more likely to be faced, noting, [...] "Mark my words, the Navy and Marine Corps <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to re-examine and question basic assumptions in light of evolving technologies, new threats and budget realities." [...] In a speech made on May 8, 2010, Gates stated that he would make politically unpopular cuts to the Pentagon bureaucracy in his future budgets.|$|E
