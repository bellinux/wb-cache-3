40|$|Image-based {{tracking}} {{of animals in}} their natural habitats can provide rich behavioural data, but is very challenging due to complex and dynamic background and target appearances. We present an effective method to recover the positions of terrestrial animals in cluttered environments from video sequences filmed using a freely moving monocular camera. The method uses residual motion cues to detect the targets and is thus robust to different lighting conditions and requires no a-priori appearance model of the animal or environment. The detection is globally optimised based on an inference problem formulation using factor graphs. This handles ambiguities such as occlusions and intersections and provides automatic initialisation. Furthermore, this formulation allows a seamless integration of occasional user input for the most difficult situations, so {{that the effect of}} a few <b>manual</b> <b>position</b> estimates are smoothly distributed over long sequences. Testing our system against a benchmark dataset featuring small targets in natural scenes, we obtain 96 accuracy for fully automated tracking.

Many new miniature and/or handheld systems have been developed and optimized. Nonetheless, these instruments are usually used with a tripod or a <b>manual</b> <b>position</b> system. This is very time consuming when performing point analysis or 2 D scanning of a surface. The Centre Européen d’Archéométrie (CEA) has build a translation system made of pluggable rails of 1 m long with a maximum length and height of 3 m. Three motors embedded in the system allow the platform to be moved along these axis, toward and backward from the sample. The rails hold a displacement system, providing a continuous movement. Any position can be reached with a reproducibility of 0. 1 mm. The displacements are controlled by an Ethernet connection through a laptop computer running a multiplatform homemade software written in JAVA. This software allows a complete control over the positioning using a simple, unique, and concise interface. Automatic scanning can be performed over a large surface of 3 meters on 3 meters. The Ethernet wires provide also the power for the different motors and, if necessary the detection head. The platform has been originally designed for a XRF detection head (with its full power alimentation) but now can accommodate many different systems like IR reflectography, digital camera, hyperspectral camera, Raman probes, etc. The positioning system can be modified to combine the acquisition software of the imaging or analytical techniques and the positioning software.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to study inequalities in health, in particular, {{focusing}} on the risk of myocardial infarction and etiologic mechanisms from a life course perspective and on epidemiological measures and methodology. Paper I uses the Swedish Burden of Disease Study together with the Social Database managed by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. The analyses in Paper II-IV {{are based on the}} Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Program (SHEEP), a population-based case-control study of first myocardial infarction, in total 2, 246 cases and 3, 206 controls, among all Swedish citizens aged 45 - 70 living in Stockholm County 1992 - 1994. Ischemic heart disease, depression and neurosis, and stroke are the three diseases with the largest contribution to the burden of disease, measured as disability-adjusted life years (DALY), in Sweden. Approximately one third of the burden of disease is unequally distributed, to a large extent this burden is put on the manual workers. The diseases with the largest contribution of DALYs to the total burden are also the diseases that stand for the largest part of the unequally distributed burden. Misclassification of socioeconomic position among women has been proposed to affect the gender comparison of socioeconomic inequalities in health. In Paper II we find women to be categorized into fewer occupational groups and more often into unclassifiable subgroups than men. However, male occupational groups are nevertheless socioeconoinically more heterogeneous. Furthermore, regarding the gender comparison of socioeconomic inequalities; empirical simulation of varying degrees of missclassification of men and women show that the dilution of the socioeconomic gradient among women, due to random misclassification of socioeconomic position, may be compensated by less misclassification among men. The accumulation model in life course epidemiology hypothesizes that the longer time spent in socioeconomic adversity the greater is the risk of disease. In Paper III each year from birth till inclusion in <b>manual</b> <b>position</b> for men and women has been defined as in socioeconomic adversity. The number of years in adversity has been used to calculate the proportion in life spent in adversity. Men always in adversity have a relative risk of 2. 36 (95 % CI: 1. 79 - 3. 11) for myocardial infarction and women in always adversity have a relative risk of 2. 54 (95 % CI: 1. 70 - 3. 78) compared to the reference ups of those never in adversity. Adjustment for unhealthy behavior, social factors, and social trajectories decreased the observed accumulation effect. The increased risk of myocardial infarction is present even after just a few years in socioeconomic adversity. Men in non-manual socioeconomic position in both childhood and adulthood have the lowest prevalence of seven cardiovascular risk factors, i. e. diabetes, hypertension, low life control, low social network, obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking. For women the pattern is similar. Those with adulthood manual experience have the highest prevalence of exposure to three or more risk factors, whereas those with nonmanual adult socioeconomic position have the highest prevalence of null-exposed. Men born in non-manual position but who end up in <b>manual</b> <b>position</b> have high prevalence of exposed to three or more risk factors and a strong tendency to cluster risk factors on the individual level. Though it is notable that the largest observed-to-expected ratio {{for both men and women}} is in the always non-manual group exposed to three or more risk factors, indicating that individual clustering is most common in this socioeconomic trajectory. We do not find that risk clustering plays an important role in the accumulation process leading to higher prevalence of multi-exposed in the most adverse socioecononfic groups. Together the findings in Paper III and IV question an overly simplistic interpretation of the accumulation hypothesis, i. e. the longer time spent in socioeconomic adversity the higher the morbidity, as they indicate that it also depends on how (social mobility) and when (critical period) the accumulation occurs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract]Pressure {{on water}} {{resources}} in Australia necessitates improved application {{of water to}} irrigated crops. Cotton is one of Australia’s major crops, but is also a large water user. On-farm water savings {{can be achieved by}} irrigating via large mobile irrigation machines (LMIMs), which are capable of implementing deficit strategies and varying water application to 1 m 2 resolution. However, irrigation amounts are commonly held constant throughout a field despite differing water requirements for different areas of a crop due to spatial variability of soil, microclimate and crop properties. This research has developed a non-destructive cotton plant dimensional measurement system, capable of mounting on a LMIM and streaming live crop measurement data to a variable-rate irrigation controller. The sensor is a vision system that measures the cotton plant attribute of internode length, i. e. the distance between main stem nodes (or branch junctions) on the plant’s main stem, which is a significant indicator of plant water stress. The vision system consisted of a Sony camcorder deinterlaced image size 720 × 288 pixels) mounted behind a transparent panel that moved continuously through the crop canopy. The camera and transparent panel were embodied in a contoured fibreglass camera enclosure (dimensions 535 mm × 555 mm × 270 mm wide) that utilised the natural flexibility of the growing foliage to firstly contact the plant, such that the top five nodes of the plant were in front of the transparent panel, and then smoothly and non-destructively guide the plant under the curved bottom surface of the enclosure. By forcing the plant into a fixed object plane (the transparent panel), reliable geometric measurement was possible without the use of stereo vision. Motorisation of the camera enclosure enabled conveyance both across and along the crop rows using an in-field chassis. A custom image processing algorithm was developed to automatically extract internode distance from the images collected by the camera, and comprised both single frame and sequential-frame analyses. Single frame processing consisted of detecting lines corresponding to branches and calculating the intersection of the detected lines with the main stem to estimate candidate node positions. Calculation of the ‘vesselness’ function for each pixel using the Hessian matrix eigenvalues determined whether the pixel was likely to belong to a stem (i. e. a curvilinear structure). Large areas of connected high-vesselness pixels were identified as branches. For each branch area, centre points were determined by solving the second order Taylor polynomial in the direction perpendicular to the line direction. The main stem was estimated with a linear Hough transform on the branch centre points within the image. Lines were then fitted to the centre points of other branch segments using the hop-along line-fitting algorithm and these lines were selectively projected to the main stem to estimate candidate node positions. The automatically-identified node positions corresponded to <b>manual</b> <b>position</b> measurements made on the source images. Within individual images, leaf edges were erroneously detected as candidate nodes (‘false positives’) and contributed up to 22...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare an {{automated}} scan planning method to <b>manual</b> scan <b>positioning</b> in routine knee {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The automated scan planning method uses anatomical landmarks in a 3 D survey of the knee. The method is trained by example plannings, consisting of <b>manual</b> slice <b>positioning</b> by an experienced technologist in 15 MRI studies. Automated knee MR examinations obtained in three geometries in 50 consecutive patients were compared to those obtained in 50 consecutive control patients, where imaging planes were planned manually. Anatomical coverage and slice angulation were scored for each geometry on a 4 -grade scale by an experienced radiologist blinded to the way of planning; groups were compared using a Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: In 150 automated sequences the technologist adapted slice positioning in four cases (addition of slices {{to adapt to the}} size of the knee), representing the only automated sequences that received a poor rating. Thirteen sequences with manual planning received a poor rating. No difference in quality was found (P > 0. 05) between automated and manual plannings for coronal coverage, sagittal coverage and angulation, and transverse angulation. Rating of automated planning was higher for transverse coverage, but lower than manual planning for coronal angulation. CONCLUSION: Automated sequence prescription for knee MRI is feasible in clinical practice, with similar quality as <b>manual</b> <b>positioning...</b>|$|R
