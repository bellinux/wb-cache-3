5000|$|During the {{rebuilding}} of the mill, French included a machine he had invented and patented in 1898, a [...] "cake trimmer", and purchased the most modern equipment then available. He met the leading citizens of Piqua. They were impressed with French, who had graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in three years, and had entrepreneurial spirit. They decided {{to invest in a}} new company he wanted to start. The French Oil Mill Machinery Company was founded 25 May 1900, with French as president, to make [...] "improved oil mill machinery". By 1905 the company was exporting its patented and rugged vegetable oil mill extraction machinery all around the world. Today, the company has customers in over 80 countries, still serving the vegetable oil extraction market (to press such seeds as soybeans, cottonseed, rapeseed, canola, and many others). In addition, the company is a world leader in synthetic rubber dewatering and drying machinery, and in hydraulic <b>molding</b> <b>presses</b> <b>for</b> rubber, thermoplastic and composite materials.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The crux to the 3 D {{design of}} cavity of {{injection}} <b>molds</b> <b>for</b> involute plastic gears is {{to solve the}} difficulty in zooming the cavity of molds and the accurate molding of the involute tooth profile. Researches {{have shown that the}} shrinkage of involute tooth profile is non-linear during the injection molding process of plastic gears. This paper presents the 3 D design of cavity of injection <b>molds</b> <b>for</b> involute gears based on SolidWorks after offering an introduction to the relationship between the cavity tooth profile of injection <b>molds</b> <b>for</b> small-modulus plastic gears and the tooth profile of injection molding part...|$|R
