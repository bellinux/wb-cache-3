25|$|Region growing {{approach}} is a method of detecting neighboring pixels with similarities. A seed point is required for such method to start. Two elements are needed for this technique to work: similarity and spatial proximity. A neighboring pixel to the seed pixel with similar intensity {{is likely to be}} the same type and will be added to the growing region. One disadvantage of this technique is that it requires <b>manual</b> <b>selection</b> of seed point, which introduces bias and inconsistency in the algorithm. This technique is also being used in optic disc identification.|$|E
25|$|The cockpit {{design of}} the TBM strives to be {{user-friendly}} and as uncomplicated to operate as possible. For pilot convenience, an automatic fuel selector automatically switches between fuel tanks periodically to effortlessly maintain fuel balance throughout flight; <b>manual</b> <b>selection</b> of fuel tanks is also possible, which remains overseen by a low fuel warning system. The ice protection system is as automated as possible, the windshield being electrically heated, the air inlet being kept warm by engine exhaust and the de-ice boots automatically cycling once activated. The electrically actuated flaps are monitored by a sophisticated split-flap protection system to prevent asymmetric deployment. An onboard air data computer calculates various values to support the pilot, such as the aircraft's true air speed, wind, and power advisory notices based upon current external temperature and altitude.|$|E
25|$|Although a spinoff of The Weather Channel, Local Now is {{formatted}} as {{a general}} news and weather channel. Because of the distribution structure of over-the-top subscription television, Local Now utilizes a version of TWC's IntelliStar unit – installed at The Weather Channel's uplink site in Atlanta – that are configured differently from that used by The Weather Channel and Weatherscan, allowing for the recycling of segments featured in one news block seamlessly into another and routine updating of segments {{to each of the}} localized feeds. Local Now's automated model – which leverages The Weather Channel's existing infrastructure and technology, and employs only three staff members – allows Local Now to be offered {{at a fraction of the}} retransmission rates charged by local broadcast stations. Users of the Local Now website and mobile app, and subscribers of over-the-top MVPD providers carrying the channel, are able to access their local feed based on ZIP code, by their IP address via geolocation, or by <b>manual</b> <b>selection,</b> allowing subscribers to access a feed from another city when they travel outside of their home market.|$|E

2500|$|Articles for {{traditional}} encyclopedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica are carefully and deliberately written by experts, lending such encyclopedias {{a reputation for}} accuracy. However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica by the science journal Nature found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that [...] "the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three." [...] Reagle suggested that while the study reflects [...] "a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors" [...] in science articles, [...] "Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects." [...] The findings by Nature were disputed by Encyclopædia Britannica, and in response, Nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by Britannica.

40|$|Automated machine {{translation}} (MT) of unrestricted texts {{is known to}} be error-prone, and thus typically requires human involvement in the translation process to achieve acceptable quality. In a conversational system performing interactive speech translation between two speakers, neither pre-editing nor conventional post-editing is possible, and the users will generally have no direct access to the embedded MT component. Since most translation errors are the result of incorrect selections, one approach to solving the dilemma is to provide the user with access to various alternative translations and allow him to select the one which appears correct in context. If the system remembers the <b>manual</b> <b>selections,</b> it can make the correct selection automatically whenever the same context is encountered thereafter...|$|R

Contrary to other calendar assistants that concentrate on automating meeting scheduling, SELFPLANNER emphasizes on scheduling the personal tasks of a user, leaving meeting arrangement for external handling.

SELFPLANNER supports simple, interruptible and flexible periodic tasks, arbitrary domains, constraints over {{the parts of}} an interruptible task, binary constraints and unary and binary preferences over tasks, location references and classes of locations. As for user interface, SELFPLANNER integrates with Google Calendar and a Google Maps based application, whereas it introduces an innovative way to define domains, based on <b>manual</b> <b>selections</b> and user-defined reusable templates.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{technique}} to calculate the spectral lags of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Unlike previous processing methods, we first smooth the light curves of gamma-ray bursts in high and low energy bands using the "Loess" filter, then, we directly define the spectral lags as such to maximize the cross-correlation function (CCF) between two smoothed light curves. This method is suitable for various shapes of CCF; it effectively avoids the errors caused by <b>manual</b> <b>selections</b> for the fitting function and fitting interval. Using the method, we have carefully measured the spectral lags of individual pulses contained in BAT/Swift gamma-ray bursts with known redshifts, and confirmed the anti-correlation between the spectral lag and the isotropy luminosity. The distribution of spectral lags can be well fitted by four Gaussian components, with the centroids at 0. 03 s, 0. 09 s, 0. 15 s, and 0. 21 s, respectively. We find that some spectral lags of the multi-peak GRBs seem to evolve with time...|$|R
