40|$|AbstractThe article aims at {{analyzing}} {{a reference}} legal instrument for seafarers’ rights – the <b>Maritime</b> Labour <b>Convention,</b> 2006. Created {{due to the}} lack of relevance of the body of international labour standards in the <b>maritime</b> sector, the <b>Convention</b> lays down in its regulations a firm set of principles and rights for an entire global industry. <b>Maritime</b> Labour <b>Convention</b> is intended to complement three key <b>maritime</b> <b>conventions,</b> SOLAS, MARPOL and STCW as well as to become the fourth pillar of an international regulatory regime for quality shipping. It is internationally unique in that it aims both to ensure decent working conditions on board and a fair framework for ship-owners operating ships under the flag of States that have ratified the Convention. This article aims to highlight the innovative aspects introduced and in the subsidiary, to what extent the Convention resolves the challenges of implementing at the flag state level and also, the possible loopholes of it...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the Rotterdam Rules, and to ascertain whether South Africa should accede to or ratify them. In order to accomplish this, South Africa's current maritime transport regime will be examined, and existing "problem areas" will be identified. This will be followed by a comparative analysis between the Rotterdam Rules and the Hague-Visby Rules, which South Africa applies as part of national law to regulate the carriage of goods by sea. As a new <b>maritime</b> <b>Convention,</b> the Rotterdam Rules have attracted widespread criticism and support, and whether such is justified will also be considered. Finally potential considerations South Africa should take into account in electing whether or not to accede or ratify the Rules have been assessed from a political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental standpoint as at 31 December 201...|$|E
