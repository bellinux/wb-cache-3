5|$|Sam Bartram, {{a former}} Charlton Athletic player {{who played for}} York during the war, was {{appointed}} manager in March 1956. Under him York narrowly <b>missed</b> <b>out</b> on becoming founder members of the Fourth Division on goal average in 1957–58, although the club's first promotion came the next season with a third-place finish. York were relegated from the Third Division after one season, and Bartram left in July 1960 to take over at Luton Town. Lockie was his successor, and {{in his first two}} seasons as manager York narrowly <b>missed</b> <b>out</b> on promotion. This was followed by two disappointing seasons, including an application for re-election after 1963–64, before York won promotion to the Third Division in 1964–65 by playing exciting and attacking football. Immediate relegation followed, and York had to apply for re-election again after 1966–67. Lockie became the first York manager to be dismissed in October 1967, with the team bottom of the Fourth Division.|$|E
5|$|As a British {{passport}} holder born outside the United Kingdom, FIFA regulations {{at the time}} allowed him to select which of the Home Nations {{he would like to}} represent, which led to interest from the non-English Home Nations. In September 1999, he rejected a call-up from Northern Ireland in favour of joining up with Wales, managed by former Manchester United teammate Mark Hughes and coach Eric Harrison. However, he picked up an ankle injury in the lead-up to the game and <b>missed</b> <b>out</b> on the match-day squad.|$|E

During the last Australian tour in 1938, the team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six England players from the season's Tests be allowed to compete. After his opponents had finalised their team, Bradman fielded a full-strength team, and Brown <b>missed</b> <b>out.</b> The match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{the tour}} with a duck, Kippax {{recovered}} with 89 at Leicester before contracting a {{heavy dose of}} influenza that forced him to miss the next four matches. On his return, he struggled for form, and was not chosen for the first Test. Kippax was the third selector on tour, and was out-voted by his fellow selectors, so the press speculated that the decision caused disharmony within the team. Australia won the game and Kippax failed in the next two tour matches, so he <b>missed</b> <b>out</b> on the next Test at Lord's, which was lost.|$|E

He was watched in a pre-season friendly playing for City against Bradford Park Avenue by his former Darlington boss Dave Penney, who had since been appointed Oldham Athletic manager.
