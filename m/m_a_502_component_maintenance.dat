40|$|Nrf 2 -small Maf (sMaf) {{heterodimer}} {{is essential}} for the inducible expression of cytoprotective genes upon exposure to oxidative and xenobiotic stresses. While the Nrf 2 -sMaf heterodimer recognizes DNA sequences referred to as the antioxidant/electrophile responsive element (ARE/EpRE), we here define these DNA sequences collectively as CNC-sMaf binding element (CsMBE). In contrast, large and small Maf proteins are able to form homodimers that recognize the Maf recognition element (MARE). CsMBE and MARE share a conserved core sequence but they differ in the 5 '-adjacent nucleotide neighboring the core. Because of the high similarity between the CsMBE and MARE sequences, it has been unclear how many target binding sites and target genes are shared by the Nrf 2 -sMaf heterodimers and Maf homodimers. To address this issue, we introduced a substitution mutation of alanine to tyrosine at position 502 in Nrf 2, which rendered the DNA-binding domain structure of Nrf 2 similar to Maf, and generated knock-in mice expressing the Nrf 2 (<b>A</b> <b>502</b> Y) mutant. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analyses showed that binding sites of Nrf 2 (<b>A</b> <b>502</b> Y) -sMaf were dramatically changed from CsMBE to MARE in vivo. Intriguingly, however, one-quarter of the Nrf 2 (<b>A</b> <b>502</b> Y) -sMaf binding sites also bound Nrf 2 -sMaf commonly and vice versa. RNA-sequencing analyses revealed that Nrf 2 (<b>A</b> <b>502</b> Y) -sMaf failed to induce expression of major cytoprotective genes upon stress stimulation, which increased the sensitivity of Nrf 2 (<b>A</b> <b>502</b> Y) mutant mice to acute acetaminophen toxicity. These results demonstrate that the unique cistrome defined as CsMBE is strictly required for the Nrf 2 -sMaf heterodimer function in cytoprotection and that the roles played by CsMBE differ sharply from those of MARE...|$|R

40|$|ERISA recites in § 502 (d) (1) that a {{plan can}} {{sue and be sued}} as an entity. Does such a {{legislative}} pronouncement, {{in and of}} itself, establish the plan as a juristic person? Further, does Congress’s declaration that a plan can be sued suggest that no other person or entity can be held liable in <b>an</b> ERISA § <b>502</b> (<b>a)</b> (1) (B) benefits claim? Relying upon ERISA § 502 (d) (1), long-standing authority in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and in other circuits, holds that the plan, and only the plan, is a proper party defendant in <b>an</b> ERISA § <b>502</b> (<b>a)</b> (1) (B) benefits claim. That is silly. A plan may be funded or unfunded. If a plan is funded through a trust, the trustee is a juristic person that controls the assets of the trust, which assets can be applied to satisfy <b>a</b> § <b>502</b> (<b>a)</b> (1) (B) judgment. Particularly when a plan is unfunded, it “owns” no assets. A plan is not a person—it is not an individual or a partnership, and plans are neither incorporated nor are they unincorporated associations. A plan is not any kind of traditionally recognized juristic person. Rather, a plan is a contract; and a plan participant’s § <b>502</b> (<b>a)</b> (1) (B) benefits claim seeks to recover money damages for breach of the plan contract. The plan sponsor establishes the plan and is the primary obligor responsible to satisfy the promises it made to covered workers as detailed in the written plan contract. In order to enforce the sponsor’s promises and to collect any possible judgment obtained in <b>a</b> § <b>502</b> (<b>a)</b> (1) (B) benefits claim, the obligor under the plan contract (the sponsor), plus any other party that assumes liability under the plan contract by agreement with the plan sponsor (a trustee or an insurer), must be party defendants. ERISA does not expressly limit the universe of possible defendants that can be liable in <b>a</b> § <b>502</b> (<b>a)</b> (1) (B) benefits claim. In fact, Congress expressly contemplated that there may be defendants beyond just the plan when it specified in § 502 (d) (2) that any money judgment obtained against a plan shall not be enforceable against any other person “unless liability against such person is established in his individual capacity... ” While a number of courts have now created some exceptions to the strict Ninth Circuit rule that only a plan can be sued in <b>a</b> § <b>502</b> (<b>a)</b> (1) (B) claim, and have allowed benefit claimants to also sue parties that “control” ERISA claims decisions, these courts have failed to identify the legal paradigm that supports their decisions. At last, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized that a plan insurer can be held liable in <b>an</b> ERISA § <b>502</b> (<b>a)</b> (1) (B) claim because the insurer is an obligor under the plan contract. All courts should follow the Seventh Circuit’s lead, and recognize that <b>a</b> § <b>502</b> (<b>a)</b> (1) (B) claim seeks legal relief for breach of the plan contract, with all that holding entails for ERISA benefit claim processes. With that result, we will the not have to worry, as a practical matter, whether the plan “entity” is a juristic person...|$|R

40|$|AbstractChartier-Harlin {{and colleagues}} [2] {{recently}} reported mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 -gamma (EIF 4 G 1) gene in families with parkinsonism. Large-scale screening found two mutations (p. R 1205 H and p. <b>A</b> <b>502</b> V) only in affected individuals, although their relative frequency was very low. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate EIF 4 G 1 parkinsonism-related variants in two separate cohorts and study coding variability across the gene. We first screened a series of familial Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients in an attempt to confirm previous results by showing segregation. Then, to determine the extent of coding variation in the gene, we first screened a cohort of sub-Saharan African individuals from the Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme Humain – Human Genome Diversity Cell Line Panel (HGDP) [1] and then analyzed data from 5350 individuals National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) exome sequencing project. We failed to identify any PD-related mutations in the familial samples. Conversely we found the p. <b>A</b> <b>502</b> V variant in the NHLBI population. We observed a high number of coding polymorphism in the exons where the two PD variants have been previously reported. We conclude that either EIF 4 G 1 variants are an extremely rare cause of familial PD in Caucasian cohorts, or that <b>A</b> <b>502</b> V is in fact a rare benign variant not involved in PD aetiology. Our data also suggests that the protein can tolerate some extent of variability particularly at this point of the gene...|$|R
