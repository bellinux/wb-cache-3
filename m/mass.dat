5|$|A {{variety of}} nuclear fusion {{reactions}} {{take place in}} the cores of stars, that depend upon their <b>mass</b> and composition. When nuclei fuse, the <b>mass</b> of the fused product is less than the <b>mass</b> of the original parts. This lost <b>mass</b> is converted to electromagnetic energy, according to the mass–energy equivalence relationship E=mc2.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method that}} {{is widely used}} in these {{analyses}} is <b>mass</b> spectrometry. Here, accurate measurement of the <b>mass</b> of the unmodified native enzyme and the inactivated enzyme gives the increase in <b>mass</b> caused by reaction with the inhibitor and shows the stoichiometry of the reaction. This is usually done using a MALDI-TOF <b>mass</b> spectrometer. In a complementary technique, peptide <b>mass</b> fingerprinting involves digestion of the native and modified protein with a protease such as trypsin. This will produce a set of peptides that can be analysed using a <b>mass</b> spectrometer. The peptide that changes in <b>mass</b> after reaction with the inhibitor {{will be the one}} that contains the site of modification.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} noted that the {{relative}} atomic <b>mass</b> of the electron Ar(e) is measured relative to the <b>mass</b> of a carbon-12 atom (divided by 12). When the Avogadro constant is set in the new SI, atomic masses might be measured in dalton (by fixing the Avogadro constant), instead of atomic <b>mass</b> units (by fixing the <b>mass</b> of carbon-12), thus resulting in a difference between the values of the relative atomic <b>mass</b> and the atomic <b>mass</b> in units of dalton.|$|E

This contrasts with {{the sources of the}} gravitational field, which are <b>masses.</b> <b>Masses</b> are sometimes described as gravitational charges, the important feature of them being that there are only positive <b>masses</b> and no negative <b>masses.</b> Further, gravity differs from electromagnetism in that positive <b>masses</b> attract other positive <b>masses</b> whereas same charges in electromagnetism repel each other.|$|R

5|$|Two {{terms are}} used in {{referring}} to a quark's mass: current quark <b>mass</b> refers to the <b>mass</b> of a quark by itself, while constituent quark <b>mass</b> refers to the current quark <b>mass</b> plus the <b>mass</b> of the gluon particle field surrounding the quark. These masses typically have very different values. Most of a hadron's <b>mass</b> comes from the gluons that bind the constituent quarks together, {{rather than from the}} quarks themselves. While gluons are inherently massless, they possess energy – more specifically, quantum chromodynamics binding energy (QCBE) – and it is this that contributes so greatly to the overall <b>mass</b> of the hadron (see <b>mass</b> in special relativity). For example, a proton has a <b>mass</b> of approximately 938MeV/c2, of which the rest <b>mass</b> of its three valence quarks only contributes about 9MeV/c2; much of the remainder {{can be attributed to the}} field energy of the gluons.

5|$|Because at {{any given}} point on Earth {{the weight of a}}n object is {{proportional}} to its <b>mass,</b> the <b>mass</b> of an object in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its weight to the weight of a standard <b>mass,</b> whose <b>mass</b> is known in kilograms, using a device called a weighing scale.
