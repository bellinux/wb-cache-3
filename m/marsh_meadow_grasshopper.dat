50|$|Chorthippus parallelus, the <b>meadow</b> <b>{{grasshopper}},</b> is {{a common}} species of grasshopper found in non-arid grasslands throughout the well vegetated areas of Europe and some adjoining areas of Asia. It is a well-studied organism in the discipline of Evolutionary biology and was an early and important model system {{for the study of}} European phylogeography.|$|R
50|$|There are {{at least}} five races of the <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> {{described}} in different regions with the Greek (C.p.tenuis), Iberian (C.p.erythropus) and central European (C.p.parallelus) forms described as separate subspecies. These subspecies {{are the result of}} the allopatric separation of Chorthippus parallelus populations into separate southern European refugia during the Pleistocene ice ages.|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{urbanization}} {{and rising}} economies are creating {{shifts in the}} composition of global food demand, so it is necessary to explore new sources of food with better nutritional profile. Among the alternative food that exists are the grasshoppers, about 80 species of which are consumed worldwide. Grasshoppers are not only rich source of proteins and lipids but also some important minor component like vitamins and minerals. Edible species of grasshopper in Belgium were identified and attempts were made for the lab rearing of <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> (Chorthippus parallelus). The lipids as well as protein contents of <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> (Chorthippus parallelus) & long winged conehead (Conocephalus discolor) were investigated. The fatty acid compositions of these two species were determined by gas chromatography. Some of the physicochemical properties of the lipids extracted were also analyzed. These two grasshopper species could be really nutritious source of food...|$|R
50|$|The {{range of}} the <b>Meadow</b> <b>Grasshopper</b> extends from the Atlantic coast of Europe to the Urals. It is found from Scandinavia in the north to {{southern}} Spain and Anatolia in the south. It prefers moist vegetation and in southern regions is typically found in river valleys and at altitude (up to approx 2000m), not being found in arid areas.|$|R
40|$|Eating insects as food, {{particularly}} grasshopper {{is practiced}} in many cultures throughout the world. <b>Meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> (Chorthippus parallelus) is {{commonly found in}} Europe and some part of Asia. It is already known that grasshoppers of Chorthippus species are consumed as food {{in countries such as}} Thailand. With the aim of evaluating the nutritional potential of this insect species the proximate nutritional composition of grasshoppers caught from the local fields was realized. Besides this, the fatty acid profile of extracted lipids, amino acid profile and mineral composition of the insect was also revealed. Results suggest that <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> is an excellent source of protein and essential amino acids. Lipids extracted from the grasshopper have an interesting fatty acid composition. Also the grasshopper contains some minerals that are important for body. With such protein content, amino acid profile, fatty acid profile of the lipids and mineral content this grasshopper species could present an interesting alternate to conventional protein sources...|$|R

Among the alternative food that exists are the grasshoppers, about 80 species of which are consumed worldwide. Grasshoppers are not only rich source of proteins and lipids but also some important minor component like vitamins and minerals. Apart from being nutritionally superior to most conventional meats their production results in lower emission of greenhouse gases & ammonia, risk of zoonotic infections in humans is much lower, water requirement for production is much less and have higher feed conversion ratio.

5000|$|The region {{behind the}} head is {{referred}} to as the [...] "pronotal side-keels" [...] and the bars are approximately parallel in this species. Although quite similar, it can be distinguished from the <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> Chorthippus parallelus, which also has straight pronotal side-keels, by a number of characteristics. These include its ability to fly, white stripe on female's wing, and more pointed snout. It often tends to be less brightly coloured and more straw-brown than Chorthippus parallelus.|$|R

5000|$|Agneau de pré-salé (French: [...] "Salt meadow lamb") {{is a type}} of lamb {{which was}} raised in salt <b>marsh</b> <b>meadows</b> of France, {{especially}} Mont Saint-Michel in Normandy and the Bay of the Somme in Picardy. The sheep graze in pastures that are covered in halophyte grasses with a high salinity and iodine content, causing their meat to have a distinct taste that is considered a delicacy.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site was}} {{formerly}} a [...] "gathering ground" [...] for water from springs {{and was used}} as a water source until the 1970s. It is mainly woodland with some <b>marsh,</b> <b>meadow</b> and open rides. One area has semi-natural birch and ash woods, and the marsh has moschatel and mature hazel and alder coppice. There are badgers and foxes, and butterflies including common browns and small coppers.|$|R
50|$|These {{katydids}} are arboreal in habitat {{with the}} vast majority of them passing their lives in shrubs and trees, feeding on leaves and tender twigs with a potential for causing much damage when present in large numbers. This is rare, however, as they live a solitary life unlike <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshoppers,</b> thus are seldom noticed by man.The Phaneropterinae differ from locusts in their habits of oviposition. Their eggs are rarely deposited in the earth or twigs, but are either glued fast in double rows to the outer surface of slender twigs or are inserted in the edges of leaves.|$|R
5000|$|Het Groene Woud. Het Groene Woud (The Green Forest) {{covers a}} total of 7500 ha of <b>marshes,</b> <b>meadows</b> and {{agricultural}} landscape between Den Bosch, Eindhoven and Tilburg. The most original part and natural state of the Dommel can be found between Eindhoven and Boxtel and hence in Nijnsel. Here the Dommel has still its original winds and meanders and forms a cultural-historical and valuable landscape area. Hiking, canoeing and cycling activities are possible in this area.|$|R
50|$|Aside from insects, {{which include}} the <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper,</b> migrant birds are {{also found in the}} area, either {{arriving}} or leaving via Portland. The scrub at the reserve provides shelter and habitat for them, although it also readily invades the open areas. Some bird species include whitethroat, lesser whitethroat, meadow pipit, kestrel, green woodpecker amongst other migrant birds. On occasion both roe deer and the herd of feral goats that help to graze the cliffs on East Weares may be seen in the area. On {{the eastern edge of the}} quarry are some ponds which hold various amphibian species. The ponds are some of the very few that can be found on Portland.|$|R

25|$|O. vernalis can {{be found}} in many {{different}} habitats, including <b>marshes,</b> <b>meadows,</b> the edges of streams, and open woods. It prefers to be on the ground, in open areas without a lot of shrubs. During hibernation, the smooth green snake looks for burrows, ant hills, and other dug-out underground areas, normally gathering in large numbers. It prefers moist habitats and areas near permanent water sources, usually staying in green areas for camouflage. Being cold blooded, it prefers warm areas, lying in the sun on rocks and logs, also using them for hiding.|$|R
50|$|The river Canche (Dutch: De Kwinte) {{is one of}} {{the rivers}} that flow from the plateau of the {{southern}} Boulonnais and Picardy, into the English Channel.

Forming an alluvial valley from 1 to 2 km wide, the Canche is a verdant landscape of calm waters, <b>marshes,</b> <b>meadows</b> and small woods. The gentle gradient, averaging 1.5 percent, gives the river a meandering course.|$|R

40|$|The gut {{bacterial}} {{community from}} four species of feral locusts and grasshoppers {{was determined by}} {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) analysis of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene fragments. The study revealed an effect of phase polymorphism on gut bacterial diversity in brown locusts from South Africa. A single bacterial phylotype, consistent with Citrobacter sp. dominated the gut microbiota of two sympatric populations of Moroccan and Italian locusts in Spain. There was evidence for Wollbachia sp. in the <b>meadow</b> <b>grasshopper</b> caught locally in the UK. Sequence analysis of DGGE products did not reveal evidence for unculturable bacteria and homologies suggested that bacterial species were principally Gammapoteobacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae similar to those recorded previously in laboratory reared locusts.
