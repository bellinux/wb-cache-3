He also won the 750 Production class at the 1970 North West 200 held in Northern Ireland followed by the 1970 TT 750 production class on a Triumph Trident.|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{simulation}} of {{the stability and}} handling properties of bicycles requires detailed road–tyre contact models. In order to develop these models, in this study, four bicycle tyres are tested {{by means of a}} rotating disc machine with the aim of measuring the components of tyre forces and torques that influence the safety and handling of bicycles. The effect of inflation pressure and tyre load is analysed. The measured properties of bicycle tyres are compared with those of <b>motorcycle</b> <b>tyre...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Starting from an {{existing}} advanced motorcycle dynamics model, which allows simulation of reasonably general motions and stability, modal and response computations for small perturbations from any trim condition, improvements are described. These concern (a) tyre/road contact geometry, (b) tyre shear force and moment descriptions, as functions of load, slip and camber, (c) tyre relax-ation properties, (d) a new analytic {{treatment of the}} monoshock rear suspension mechanism with sample results, (e) parameter values describing a contemporary high performance machine and rider, (f) steady-state equilibrium and power checking and (g) steering control. In particular, the “Magic Formula ” <b>motorcycle</b> <b>tyre</b> model is utilised and complete sets of parameter values for contemporary tyres are derived by identification methods. The new model is used for steady turning, stability, design parameter sensitivity and response to road forcing calculations. The results show the predictions of the model to be in general agreement with observations of motorcycle behaviour {{from the field and}} they suggest that frame flexibility remains an important design and analysis area, despite improvements in frame designs over recent years. Motorcycle rider parameters have significant influences on the behaviour, with results consistent with a commonly held view, that lightweight riders are more likely to suffer oscillation problems than heavyweight ones...|$|E

50|$|Cornering {{force is}} the lateral (i.e. {{parallel}} to the road surface) force produced by a vehicle tyre during cornering. Cornering force coefficients of <b>motorcycle</b> <b>tyres</b> tends to decrease with increased vertical load, increased inflation pressure, and increased temperature.|$|R
50|$|Rolling {{resistance}} is the resistance {{that occurs when}} a tyre rolls on a flat surface. The rolling resistance coefficients of <b>motorcycle</b> <b>tyres</b> are about 0.02. It tends to increase with forward speed and decrease as inflation pressures increase.|$|R
25|$|Different {{types of}} {{motorcycles}} have different dynamics and these {{play a role}} in how a motorcycle performs in given conditions. For example, one with a longer wheelbase provides the feeling of more stability by responding less to disturbances. <b>Motorcycle</b> <b>tyres</b> have a large influence over handling.|$|R

50|$|<b>Motorcycle</b> <b>tyres</b> (tires in American English) are {{the outer}} part of {{motorcycle}} wheels, attached to the rims, providing traction, resisting wear, absorbing surface irregularities, and allowing the motorcycle to turn via countersteering. The two tyres' contact patches are the motorcycle's connection to the ground, and so are fundamental to the motorcycle's suspension behaviour, and critically affect safety, braking, fuel economy, noise, and rider comfort.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} <b>motorcycle</b> <b>tyres</b> {{is a clear}} {{progression}} of steady improvement in grip, allowing better acceleration, braking, and turning, along with improved comfort, safety, durability, and reliability. This progression has generally meant a steady increase in tyre width, {{so much so that}} Kevin Cameron noted the assumption among riders that [...] "bigger must be better in every way", leading to, [...] "the temptation to overwhelm motorcycles with the biggest tyres the owner can find." [...] While many advances in tyre materials and construction have yielded unalloyed benefits, at a given level of technological sophistication, every design choice, such as tyre width, diameter, cross-section curvature, and the geometry of the <b>motorcycle</b> the <b>tyres</b> are intended for is a trade-off and a compromise.|$|R
50|$|The Jappic, {{first entered}} at Brooklands on the Easter Monday meeting of 1925, {{was a tiny}} two seater cyclecar that had a 344cc JAP {{motorcycle}} engine. The car was designed by H.M.Walters and built by the coachbuilders Jarvis of Wimbledon. The frame was made from the wood ash with 3/32 inch steel flitch plates and tubular cross-members. It had expanding rear brakes on the rear, but no front brakes. The wheels where shod with 650x65 <b>motorcycle</b> <b>tyres,</b> which were attached by a chain-driven axle to a two-port overhead valve 74x80mm single-cylinder JAP engine via a three-speed gearbox (chain-driven from the engine).|$|R
40|$|When {{driving along}} a {{circular}} path, {{the driver of}} a motorcycle controls the vehicle mainly by means of steering torque. If low steering torque is necessary, the driver feels that the vehicle is manoeuvrable. In this paper, a mathematical model concerning steering torque is developed; it {{takes into account the}} actual kinematic behaviour of the vehicle and the properties of <b>motorcycle</b> <b>tyres.</b> Tyre forces act at the contact points of toroidal tyres, which are calculated according to kinematic analysis. Non-linear equations are solved using an iterative approach. Several numerical results are presented, and the influence of tyre properties and some geometrical and inertial properties of the vehicle on steering torque are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Designed by H.M. Walters of JA Prestwich Industries, the Jappic was {{advertised as}} the [...] "world's {{smallest}} racecar". Built by Jarvis, the two seater cyclecar used an air-cooled two-port overhead valve 74x80mm single-cylinder 344cc JA Prestwich [...] "JAP" [...] motorcycle engine, sat in an ash wood frame covered with 3/32 inch steel flitch plates and tubular cross-members. A three-speed gearbox used a chain-drive {{to the rear}} axle, with only the rear live axle equipped with brakes, with all four wheels using 650x65 <b>motorcycle</b> <b>tyres.</b> Weighing in at only [...] and costing just £150 to buy, the car was aimed at competing in the holiday-handicap races. After Walters broke the Class J flying mile record in the car at a speed of 70.33 mph, it was subsequently advertised being able to lap Brooklands at over 68 mph.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} a basic {{insight into the}} two-wheeled vehicle dynamics {{to be applied to}} vehicle modelling and control. The most relevant kinematic properties are discussed. In two-wheeled vehicles, the relationship between the handlebar and kinematic steering angles varies appreciably with the roll angle. The chapter discusses the peculiarities of <b>motorcycle</b> <b>tyres.</b> The performance of two-wheeled vehicles is largely influenced by the characteristics of their tyres. A fundamental concept when dealing with tyre behaviour is the coupling between longitudinal and lateral forces on the contact patch. The most popular suspension schemes are presented. The proper choice of front and rear suspension characteristics depends on many parameters like the road surface, the braking performance, and the engine power, among others. Different in-plane models of increasing complexity are presented to highlight the main vehicle dynamics involved. Finally, the chapter highlights the coupling between in-plane and out-of-plane dynamics...|$|R

50|$|In 1974 {{two young}} Whataroa brothers, Kevin and Rodney Giles, formed the Duzgo Manufacturing Company {{to make a}} small two wheel drive light utility vehicle for use {{primarily}} on farms. Their creation, called the Duzgo was made using assorted Austin and Morris parts, a single-cylinder Kohler 12 hp engine and a double gearbox giving 12 forward and three reverse gears. Later models used a Robin 14-16 hp twin opposed engine. It was light and ran on knobbly <b>motorcycle</b> <b>tyres</b> which gave it excellent traction in muddy farm conditions. In all 10 were made by 1979 before the Customs Department determined that they were a vehicle manufacturing business and therefore needed to pay 30% sales tax on each vehicle. This effectively ended their business. In 2004 a Duzgo featured in the BBC series Billy Connolly's World Tour of New Zealand. There is a Duzgo (possibly number 1) in the Coaltown Museum, Queen Street, Westport and several still remain in use.|$|R
5000|$|The Chopper's patent {{was applied}} for in the US in 1967. The Chopper was {{introduced}} at American trade shows in January 1969 {{but it was not}} until April 1969 when Raleigh Choppers were available for public to purchase. The bike featured a choice of a single-speed coaster hub, or a 3-speed or 5-speed Sturmey Archer gear hub, selected using a frame-mounted console gear lever — one of its [...] "cool" [...] features. Other features that appealed to the youth market were the unusual frame, long padded high-back seat, sprung seat at the back, high-rise (ape hanger) handlebars, 'bobbed' mudguards (fenders) and differently sized wheels — 16 in front and 20 in rear. The rear hoop above the seat resembled a dragster anti roll bar [...] "sissy bar". Even the kickstand was designed to give the stationary bicycle a lean reminiscent of a parked <b>motorcycle.</b> <b>Tyres</b> were wider than usual for the time, with a chunky tread on the rear wheel, featuring a red line around the sidewall.|$|R

25|$|Gustave Adolphe Clément from 1909 Clément-Bayard (22 September 1855 – 10 March 1928) was a French entrepreneur.

40|$|The {{properties}} of tyres {{have a large}} influence on the stability of single-track vehicles. This paper focuses on the characterization of the dynamic {{properties of}} tyres. In {{the first section of}} the paper, modal analysis of the tyres is presented. Two <b>motorcycle</b> <b>tyres</b> and four scooter tyres are modally tested in order to measure the natural frequencies and the damping coefficients of the first typical modes of vibration. Tests are carried out for seven different inflation pressures in order to study how the pressure affects the properties of the tyres. The modal stiffnesses and the damping coefficients are identified for each mode of vibration. The second section of the paper focuses on the characterization of the transient properties of the tyres according to a ring model, in which the tyre tread is a ring connected to the rim with a series of springs and dampers. A comparison between a first-order model, which takes into account only the modal stiffnesses, and a second-order model, which considers also the self-aligning torques and the modal damping coefficients, is made. A prediction of the relaxation length according to the first-order model is presented. The relaxation length is calculated considering the term due to the measured contact patch, the terms due to the stiffnesses of the lateral and camber modes and the residual stiffness term, which accounts for the modes with ring deflection. In the last section, the predicted relaxation lengths are compared with those measured by means of a tester machine...|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{introduced}} in early 1968 as the Roadmaster K81 rear tyre by Dunlop Rubber Co. Ltd, the tyre was renamed [...] "TT100" [...] {{because it was}} the first production tyre to reach a lap speed of 100 mph over the Isle of Man TT race course when Malcolm Uphill rode his works Thruxton Bonneville to victory in 1969 with a fastest lap of 100.37 mph during the 750 cc class production race. The feat was repeated in 1971 when Ray Pickrell averaged 100.01 mph on a Triumph Trident Slippery Sam replica, a modified version of the <b>motorcycle</b> the <b>tyre</b> was designed for. The tyres were standard fitment on production models of BSA and Triumph triple motorcycles.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} steady turn {{behaviours}} of some light motorcycle models on circular paths, using the commercial software package ADAMS-Motorcycle. Steering torque and steering angle are obtained for several path radii {{and a range}} of steady forward speeds. For path radii much greater than motorcycle wheelbase, and for all <b>motorcycle</b> parameters including <b>tyre</b> parameters held fixed, dimensional analysis can predict the asymptotic behaviour of steering torque and angle. In particular, steering torque is a function purely of lateral acceleration plus another such function divided by path radius. Of these, the first function is numerically determined, while the second is approximated by an analytically determined constant. Similarly, the steering angle is a function purely of lateral acceleration, plus another such function divided by path radius. Of these, the first is determined numerically while the second is determined analytically. Both predictions are verified through ADAMS simulations for various tyre and geometric parameters. In summary, steady circular motions of a given <b>motorcycle</b> with given <b>tyre</b> parameters can be approximately characterised by just one curve for steering torque and one for steering angle...|$|R
