40|$|The {{concept of}} {{metrological}} traceability of measurement results to property values assigned to measurement standards of higher <b>metrological</b> <b>order</b> {{or to the}} International System of Units (SI) through sequential calibrations, using reference materials and reference measurement procedures, {{plays a key role}} in ensuring that end user measurement procedures perform at an acceptable level in the clinical context. The aim is that measurement results produced over time or by different end users or with different end user measurement procedures for the same measurand will be equivalent within their corresponding uncertainties. These goals can only be reached under certain conditions and if requirements laid down in international standards on calibration concepts, reference measurement procedures and reference materials are fulfilled. Calibration hierarchies have to be implemented correctly and parameters contributing to measurement uncertainty and systematic bias need to be controlled and eliminated, respectively, by technically improving methods and reference materials and intermediate calibrators used for effectively achieving equivalence of measurement results and for meeting analytical performance requirements for in vitro diagnostic devices.

40|$|In this study, {{the first}} steps in the {{development}} of a secondary reference measurement procedure (RMP) "higher <b>metrological</b> <b>order</b> measurement procedure" to support the cardiac troponin I (cTnI) standardization initiative is described. The RMP should be used to assign values to serumbased secondary reference materials (RMs) without analytical artifacts causing bias. A multiplexed bead-based assay and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were used to identify the optimum monoclonal antibody pair (clones 560 and 19 C 7) for the RMP. Using these antibodies, an ELISA-based procedure was developed to accurately measure the main cTnI forms present in blood. The proposed RMP appears to show no bias when tested on samples containing various troponin complexes, phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms, and heparin. The candidate assay displayed suitable linearity and sensitivity (limit of detection, 0. 052 mg/L) for the measurement of the proposed cTnI secondary RMs. Preliminary comparison data on patient samples with a commercial cTnI assay are also provided to support the suitability of RMP for value assignment to RMs. Full validation and final assessment of the RMP will be performed through transferability and intercomparison studies.

It is now necessary to follow and account for the ecological and chemical status of aquatic ecosystems. This status should improve with the objective of "good status" in 2015 for all waters of Member States. Such a regulation will lead to an intensification of chemical contaminants control and has important <b>metrological</b> implications. In <b>order</b> to ensure the comparability of data, it appears necessary to develop internationally validated standard methods and to organise intercomparison exercises for analytical laboratories...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{digital cameras}} with {{sophisticated}} optics enable accurate shape measurements via {{a plethora of}} <b>metrological</b> techniques. In <b>order</b> {{to take advantage of}} the data delivered by high-resolution cameras, one needs a sufficiently flexible model to describe the imaging geometry and an adequate calibration procedure to determine the model parameters and estimate their uncertainties. In this report, we suggest the concept of a smooth generic camera model that has several advantages compared to the state-of-the-art: the description is resolution-independent and takes advantage of the natural smoothness of the projection geometry; the global and the local symmetries inherent to the view ray-based parametrization are regularized in an explicitly unbiased manner. The calibration procedure uses dense datasets that can be obtained with the technique of active screens and consistently accounts for the uncertainty in the registration data that can be extracted during pre-processing. The concept is illustrated with synthetic examples based on physically-accurate rendering...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The {{measurement}} of the electrical energy and its billing for tax purpose are of great relevance. In spite of its importance, in the past a scarce attention was given to issues as the calibration and the traceability of the electrical energy meters, so that, at least in Italy, more than 30 millions of energy meters operate and put a tariff without proper metrological characterization. This situation is caused by both the absence of specific laws and the high cost related to the traceability process. In this ambit, a new European Directive on measuring instruments (MID) was introduced in 2004 {{with the aim of}} providing a high level of <b>metrological</b> protection in <b>order</b> that any party affected can have confidence in the result of measurement. In Italy the MID was adopted by a legislative decree and imposed that: (i) each active electrical energy meter put into service has to be kept in test for a period for verifying its operating; (ii) after the test period, with positive result, the meter has to be calibrated at least twice in the year. The paper proposes a discussion about the issues of active electrical energy meter calibration and the analysis of requirements of the MID. Finally, the design of a device that may solve the problem of the traceability to national standards in easy and economic way is reported...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the sensitivity of}} a large set of neuropsychological tests to detect cognitive changes due to prodromal Alzheimer's disease(AD); to compare their <b>metrological</b> properties in <b>order</b> to select a restricted number of these tests for the longitudinal follow-up of subjects with prodromal AD. PARTICIPANTS: 212 patients with mild cognitive impairment were tested at baseline by a standardised neuropsychological battery, which included: the Free and Cued Selective Reminding test (FCSRT), the Benton Visual Retention test, the Deno 100, verbal fluency, a serial digit learning test, the double task of Baddeley, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) similarities, the Trail-Making Test and the WAIS digit symbol test. Patients were monitored every 6 months for up to 3 years {{in order to identify}} those who converted to AD (retrospectively classified as prodromal AD). Statistical analyses were performed using a nonlinear multivariate mixed model involving a latent process. This model assumes that the psychometric tests are nonlinear transformations of a common latent cognitive process, and it captures the metrological properties of tests. RESULTS: 57 patients converted to AD. The most sensitive tests in the detection of cognitive changes due to prodromal AD were the FCSRT, the semantic verbal fluency and the Deno 100. Some tests exhibited a higher sensitivity to cognitive changes for subjects with high levels of cognition, such as the free recall, delayed free recall scores of the FCSRT and the semantic verbal fluency, whereas others showed a higher sensitivity at low levels of cognition, such as the total recall score of the FCSRT. CONCLUSIONS: Tests used for the follow-up of prodromal AD subjects should be chosen among those that actually decline in this stage of the disease and should be selected according to the subject's initial scores...|$|R
40|$|Background Currently, {{little is}} known about the effects that metal {{transfer}} affecting hip implants may have on roughness. The main aim of this study is to propose a <b>metrological</b> technique in <b>order</b> to better characterize this phenomenon on the surface of composite ceramic femoral heads, discussing its influence on the biotribological behaviour of the coupling. In addition, through the acquired data, we investigate whether the metal transfer extension and roughness alterations on a femoral head is correlated to the material, the follow-up of the implant and whether metal transfer is associated with changes in the roughness of alumina surface, considering different follow-ups. Methods Three generations of femoral heads manufactured in ceramic (Biolox®, Biolox® Forte, and Biolox® Delta) were retrieved from patients after different implantation periods (mean follow up = 6. 9 years) and they were analysed using a roughness tester and an optical non-contact 3 D scanner, in order to characterize the metal transfer on the bearing surface. Results Surface area where the metal transfer was observed ranged between 29. 6 mm 2 and 573. 6 mm 2. The mean values of Sa (average roughness) were different between the Affected Zone (0. 3 ± 0. 1 μm) and Unaffected Zone (0. 03 ± 0. 1 μm). In particular, regions of metal transfer were rougher than the non-metal transfer regions of the articular surface and this is demonstrated by both the areal roughness parameters considered: Sa (arithmetic mean height) and St (maximum height of the surface) parameters (p = 0. 002, Wilcoxon paired-test). St parameter acquired on the Biolox® Delta femoral heads showed the lowest mean value (11. 92 μm). Conclusion We found no correlation between follow-up vs. roughness and total surface area of metal transfer. Furthermore, we found that the amount of areal coverage of metal transfer is correlated with the surface roughness. Finally, MT effect on composite ceramic implants caused lower height of peaks and valleys when compared to common ceramic...|$|R
