5|$|SIM's new {{technology}} {{was meant to}} lead to the development of telescopes powerful enough to take images of Earth-like extrasolar planets orbiting distant stars and to determine whether those planets are able to sustain life. NASA has already started developing future missions that will build on SIM's technological legacy. The technological development phase of the mission was completed in November 2006 with the announcement that the eight, mission-technology-milestones set by NASA <b>were</b> reached. The <b>milestones</b> <b>were</b> <b>necessary</b> steps in the technological development before flight control instruments could begin to be designed. The completion of each milestone meant that new systems had to be developed for nanometer control as well as picometer knowledge technology; these systems enable the telescope to make its accurate measurements with extreme accuracy.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Prolonged {{sedation}} {{treatment in}} neonatal pediatric populations {{is associated with}} opioid and benzodiazepine tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal syndrome. Despite the clinical relevance of this problem, we have limited knowledge of the long-term repercussions. Current literature focuses on premature neonates and suggests that opioid exposure may cause neurodevelopmental sequelae. The main objective of this literature review was to investigate what infant populations {{are at risk of}} developing short-term and/or long-term consequences from prolonged infantile sedation exposure. PUBLISHED STUDIES: A literature review was conducted on previous studies that focused primarily on the effects of opioids and benzodiazepines on infants and how it may affect the future development in these children. Studies show that short-term consequences include increased heart rate, increased respiratory rate, increased blood pressure, intracranial pressure fluctuations, and risk of further complications such as intraventriculat hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), or even death. Long-term repercussions incluse the possibility of decreased brain volume, decreased head circumference and body weight, intelligence deficits, and social and behavioral issues. DISCUSSION: Standard pain and sedation management involves the use of opioids and benzodiazepines. Treatment duration and medication dosage depend on severity of the patient’s illness. Since prolonged sedation administration is often associated with tolerance and dependence, future research (such as long-term follow up of these infants at later neurological <b>milestones)</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to determine possible short-term and long-term neurological and behavioural sequelae for infants exposed to prolonged treatment with opioids and benzodiazepines. Standardized pain and sedation management guidelines may also increase the effectiveness of treatment and drug administration...|$|R
40|$|The Hubrecht Organoid Technology Institute (HUB) {{is looking}} for {{business}} models to market their patented organoid technology. Using organoid technology, {{it is possible to}} culture personal mini-organs and mini-tumors from patient material. Storing patient-derived organoids in a Living BioBank provides opportunities for precision drug discovery and personal medicine in the cancer field. This thesis analyses competing techniques competing companies in an effort to find the best strategic position in the market for the HUBs organoid technology. Several business models are proposed including a licensing model, a fee-for-service model, a cooperative drug discovery model and a personal diagnostic model. As a conclusion of the thesis, a 5 year strategy roadmap is presented containing the experiments and <b>milestones</b> that <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> in order to successfully implement all proposed business models...|$|R
40|$|Breast cancer (BC) has {{the highest}} {{occurrence}} and mortality of all cancers that affect women {{with more than one}} million new cases each year across the globe. BC accounts for about one-quarter of all cancer-related deaths. Even though breast cancer is an aggressive and fatal disease, early detection and treatment can result in increased survival in more than three-quarters of diagnosed patients. In general, traditional diagnostic methods, such as ultrasonography and mammography, considerably increase t survival rates due to early disease detection. Although these traditional methods are useful, new strategies for early detection of breast cancer would likely reduce breast cancer mortality rates. Additional diagnostic imaging modalities, such as Computer omography (CT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), and other types of scintigraphy techniques, have been used to identify the primary source of the cancer in metastatic cases, but none of these techniques is yet in routine clinical use. Among other imaging methodologies, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) approaches are powerful tools for uncovering cancer biomarkers. In this review, we consider the current capabilities of magnetic resonance techniques in breast cancer research and highlight some <b>milestones</b> that <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> to move early detection of breast cancer using such approaches into mainstream health care modalities...|$|R
