40|$|A {{study of}} the {{relationship}} between total ozone and tropopause pressure was carried out using Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data and National Meteorological Center (NMC) global analyses. The medium scales generally show correlations greater than 0. 6 throughout the <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes</b> of both hemispheres with some regions exceeding 0. 8.

A detailed spectral analysis is performed for the medium scales on five pairs of time series of area averaged tropopause pressure and total ozone. In <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes,</b> total ozone and tropopause pressure exhibit generally similar distributions in the power spectrum. In the subtropics and tropics the power in ozone drops off more rapidly with increasing frequency than the power in tropopause pressure. Only in the Northern Hemisphere <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes</b> does one find a clear association between increased power in ozone and tropopause pressure and maxima in the coherency spectrum. Results for large scales are more complicated, showing generally positive correlations at <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes...</b>|$|R

When the AO index is positive, surface pressure is low in the polar region. This helps the <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> jet stream to blow strongly and consistently from west to east, thus keeping cold Arctic air locked in the polar region.

40|$|The {{troposphere}} is {{the part}} of the atmosphere where people live. The troposphere goes up to about 12 km above the earth over places at <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes</b> like Washington, D. C. The next layer of air up in the atmosphere is called the stratosphere. The tropopause separates the troposphere and stratosphere. Most of the ozone in the atmosphere is in the stratosphere where it protects people from the harmful rays in sunlight. Near the earth s surface, ozone is a pollutant. In general, air travels from the troposphere to the stratosphere through upward motion in the tropics. Most of the air comes back down to the troposphere at <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes.</b> The so-called "stratospheric residual circulation" moves the air in the stratosphere from the tropics to the <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes.</b> In this way, the amount of air that moves out of the stratosphere into the troposphere at <b>middle</b> <b>latitudes</b> depends on the strength of the residual circulation. This overturning of the atmosphere is important as it brings chemicals produced by the activities of people into the stratosphere. Most notable are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that destroy stratospheric ozone. The transport of air out of the stratosphere removes ozone-destroying chemicals, but also brings ozone into the troposphere...|$|R
5000|$|The Trewartha {{system was}} a 1966 update of the Köppen climate classification, {{and sought to}} redefine <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> climates into smaller zones (the {{original}} Köppen system grouped all <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> climates into a single zone). Under the Trewartha climate classification, climates are termed humid subtropical when they have monthly mean air temperatures higher than 10 °C (50 °F) for eight or more months a year {{and at least one}} month with mean temperature below 18 °C (64.4 °F). Under the Trewartha system, humid subtropical climates typically occupy the southernmost portions of the temperate zone from 23.5 to 35.0 north and south latitude. [...] Rainfall often shows a summer peak, especially where monsoons are well developed, as in Southeast Asia and Florida (USA). Other areas have a more uniform or varying rainfall cycles, but never have dry months on the summer (climatologically). Most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms that build up due to the intense surface heating and strong subtropical sun angle. Weak tropical lows that move in from adjacent warm tropical oceans, as well as infrequent tropical storms often contribute to high sun (summer) seasonal rainfall peaks. Winter rainfall is often associated with large storms in the westerlies that have fronts that reach down into subtropical latitudes. However, many subtropical climates such as southeast Asia or Florida have very dry winters, with frequent brush fires and water shortages.|$|E

5000|$|Auroral chorus can be {{detected}} primarily around the magnetic equator, specifically in two distinct frequency bands, one above the equatorial half gyro-frequency and one below it. The gyro-frequency ranges from 0.6 kHz to about 1.6 kHz. Distinguishable on high resolution wideband spectrographs, the wave amplitude grows linearly then switches to non-linear.

5000|$|The {{basic premise}} of the film, that the {{movement}} of the Earth's magnetic north and south poles to the <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> would cause a massive climatic shift, is only partially true. Although such an event (if it were possible) would result in dramatic effects on global weather patterns, it would not reverse the Earth's climate zones as shown in the film, since climate is governed not just by the Earth's magnetic field, but mainly by altitude and proximity to the poles via the tilt of the Earth's axis, which affords lower latitudes more direct sun rays. [...] Furthermore, {{the movement of the}} poles, not the magnetic poles, would move both arctic and temperate regions, but would not necessarily trigger an ice age. It would not cause an ice age localized to Miami, as the film suggests.|$|E
50|$|Oceanic climates are not {{necessarily}} always found in coastal locations on the aforementioned parallels; however, in most cases oceanic climates parallel higher <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> oceans. The polar jet stream, which moves in a west to east direction across the middle latitudes, advancing low pressure systems, storms, and fronts. In coastal areas of the higher middle latitudes (45-60° latitude), the prevailing onshore flow creates {{the basic structure of}} most oceanic climates. Oceanic climates are a product and reflection of the ocean adjacent to them. In the fall, winter, and early spring, when the polar jet stream is most active, the frequent passing of marine weather systems creates the frequent fog, cloudy skies, and light drizzle often associated with oceanic climates. In summer, high pressure often pushes the prevailing westerlies north of many oceanic climates, often creating a drier summer climate (for example in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada).|$|E

50|$|The ITCZ {{would be}} {{expected}} to overlie the geographic equator according to symmetric solar radiation. However, the ITCZ is mostly perennial in the northern hemisphere and in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It was originally explained by the asymmetrical distribution of continents. However, the distribution of land and ocean is severely asymmetric in the Indian Ocean, yet the ITCZ moves back and forth there between the southern and northern hemispheres. Continents surround the Indian Ocean and monsoons prevail. Where the thermocline is deeper indicates that there is a weaker interaction between atmosphere and ocean. Due to the relatively small scale and deep thermocline in the Indian Ocean, there will be less asymmetric effects. In the <b>middle</b> <b>latitude</b> Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, because of the large scale easterly wind system and the western continents boundaries, the thermocline is definitely shallower in eastern part. Thus, the asymmetry is obvious in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Ocean. There are two factors that are acknowledged by oceanographers and meteorologists: the interactions between ocean and atmosphere and the geometries of the continents.|$|E

40|$|In this report, the {{significant}} oceanographic factors influencing spatial-distributions for bigeye tuna {{species in the}} Indian Ocean were investigated {{on the basis of}} the data collected and accumulated in the past years. The results show that bigeye tuna are distributed in water with the optimum temperature in a range of 10 ? C- 16 ? C irrespective of their sexual maturity and water mass. Accordingly, the vertical distribution of tuna is predicted by the temperature profile; the tunas are only found in the deeper layer in the tropical region while they are distributed up to the shallower layer in the <b>middle</b> <b>latitude.</b> On the other hand, the bigeye tuna reaching the maturity is found only beneath the layer between 0 and 50 m where the sea water temperature exceeds 26 ?C.

This decrease coincides with the decrease in sea area where the water temperature in the layer above 50 m is warmer than 26 ?
