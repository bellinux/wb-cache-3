25|$|In some contexts, {{dimensional}} quantities {{are expressed}} as dimensionless quantities or percentages by omitting some dimensions. For example, debt-to-GDP ratios are generally expressed as percentages: total debt outstanding (dimension of currency) divided by annual GDP (dimension of currency) – but one <b>may</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> in comparing a stock to a flow, annual GDP should have dimensions of currency/time (dollars/year, for instance), and thus Debt-to-GDP should have units of years, {{which indicates that}} Debt-to-GDP {{is the number of}} years needed for a constant GDP to pay the debt, if all GDP is spent on the debt and the debt is otherwise unchanged.|$|E
25|$|People with OCD can use rationalizations {{to explain}} their {{behavior}}; however, these rationalizations {{do not apply to}} the overall behavior but to each instance individually. For example, a person compulsively checking the front door <b>may</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is still not sure and deems it is still better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.|$|E

25|$|A {{criticism}} {{is that the}} BRIC projections {{are based on the}} assumptions that resources are limitless and endlessly available when needed. In reality, many important resources currently necessary to sustain economic growth, such as oil, natural gas, coal, other fossil fuels, and uranium might soon experience a peak in production before enough renewable energy can be developed and commercialized, which might result in slower economic growth than anticipated, thus throwing off the projections and their dates. The economic emergence of the BRICs will have unpredictable consequences for the global environment. Indeed, proponents of a set carrying capacity for the Earth <b>may</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that,</b> given current technology, there is a finite limit to how much the BRICs can develop before exceeding the ability of the global economy to supply.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} of these roles have culminated in assisting {{the creation of}} a society where NGOs serve as important players in the global arena in regards to maintaining human security. Due to this increasing influence and the emergence of growing natural and man-made disasters, NGOs now are contracted by governments in order to adequately respond to crises, as well as assist individual or collectivised groups of citizens in lobbying their interests; thus culminating in the ability to enact, influence and change government agendas. However, NGOs are still largely dependent on certain levels of government funding, hence critics <b>may</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> NGOs pose the ability to potentially damage issues of human security due to this financial dependence. Despite these critiqes, the focus, expertise and infrastructure developed by NGOs through their activities linked with human development and human rights allow them to make unique contributions to human security provision.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, as {{expected}} Janus {{is present in}} region I of Martianus Capella's division of Heaven and in region XVI, the last one, {{are to be found}} the Ianitores terrestres (along with Nocturnus), perhaps to be identified in Forculus, Limentinus and Cardea, deities strictly related to Janus as his auxiliaries (or perhaps even no more than concrete subdivisions of his functions) as the meaning of their names implies: Forculus is the god of the forca, a iugum, low passage, Limentinus the guardian of the limes, boundary, Cardea the goddess of hinges, here of the gates separating Earth and Heaven. The problem posed by the qualifying adjective terrestres earthly, can be addressed in two different ways. One hypothesis is that Martianus's depiction implies a descent from Heaven onto Earth. However Martianus's depiction does not look to be confined to a division Heaven-Earth as it includes the Underworld and other obscure regions or remote recesses of Heaven. Thence one <b>may</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the articulation Ianus-Ianitores could be interpreted as connected to the theologem of the Gates of Heaven (the Synplegades) which open on the Heaven on one side and on Earth or the Underworld on the other.|$|E

25|$|Despite the flair of Stange's reign, {{it would}} take the more {{tactical}} approach of Mich d'Avray to finally win the NSL Championship. While less flamboyant than his predecessor, d'Avray successfully transformed the team with a different strategy to the previous coaches. The attacking 5–3–2, which saw almost as many goals conceded as scored, was replaced with a 4–4–2. Some <b>may</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the team began to play a less attractive form of the game, but nobody could argue with the results. In 2001/2, the team nearly went the entire season undefeated with a side that only had former Adelaide City midfielder Brad Hassell as a major addition. After scraping through in the second leg of the major semi final against Newcastle, Glory faced Sydney Olympic in the grand final at a sold-out Subiaco Oval. While the 2000 Final {{was one of the great}} games of domestic Australian association football, the 2002 final was a tight and tense affair with Glory hardly getting a shot on target due to the fact that they lacked any bite in the midfield and had their two strikers marked out of the game. Ante Miličić was on target for Olympic though and his goal early in the second half was enough for Olympic to win 1–0 and break the hearts of Glory fans once again. It was also to be former Socceroo Alistair Edwards final match before retirement.|$|E

500|$|The {{effects of}} Lat's works were not {{confined}} to the artistic sector. [...] In the period before his debut, Malaysian cartoonists supported calls for national unity. [...] The characters in a cartoon were often of one race, and negative focus on the foibles of particular races or cultures worked its way into the mainstream. [...] Such cartoons did not help to soothe racial tensions that were simmering then. [...] The situation erupted with the racial riots of 1969, and for several years after these incidents relationships among the races were raw and fragile. [...] According to Redza, Lat soothed the nation's racial woes with his works. [...] Drawing members of various races in his crowd scenes and showing their interactions with one another, Lat portrayed Malaysians in a gentle and unbiased comic manner. [...] Redza pointed out although one <b>may</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Lat was forced into the role of racial and cultural mediator (because of his employment with his country's [...] "leading English-language newspaper serving a multi-racial readership"), he possessed the necessary qualities—intimate knowledge of various races and culture—to succeed in the job. [...] Lat's fans recognised the trademark of his oeuvre as [...] "a safe and nice humour that made everyone feel good and nostalgic by appealing to their benevolent sides rather than by poking at their bad sides". [...] It proved to be a successful formula; more than 850,000copies of his books were sold in the twelve years after the first compilation of his editorial cartoons went on sale in 1977. [...] The comfort that readers sought from his works was such that when in September 2008 Lat deviated from his usual style, to draw a cartoon about racially charged politicking in his country, it shocked journalist Kalimullah Hassan. [...] She found the illustration of a group of Malaysians huddled under an umbrella, taking shelter from a rain of xenophobic phrases, full of profound sadness.|$|E

2500|$|Note that as {{with all}} parts of the law, there are exceptions.

2500|$|One common {{argument}} against pacifism {{is the possibility}} of using violence to prevent further acts of violence (and reduce the [...] "net-sum" [...] of violence). This argument hinges on consequentialism: an otherwise morally objectionable action can be justified if it results in a positive outcome. For example, either violent rebellion, or foreign nations sending in troops to end a dictator's violent oppression may save millions of lives, even if many thousands died in the war. Those pacifists who base their beliefs on deontological grounds would oppose such violent action. Others would oppose organized military responses but support individual and small group self-defense against specific attacks if initiated by the dictator's forces. Pacifists <b>may</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> military action could be justified should it subsequently advance the general cause of peace.|$|E
2500|$|Proximate cause {{means that}} you {{must be able to}} show that the harm was caused by the tort you are suing for. The defense <b>may</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> there was a prior cause or a {{superseding}} intervening cause. A common situation where a prior cause becomes an issue is the personal injury car accident, where the person re-injures an old injury. For example, someone who has a bad back is injured in the back in a car accident. Years later he is still in pain. He must prove the pain is caused by the car accident, and not the natural progression of the previous problem with the back. [...] A superseding intervening cause happens shortly after the injury. For example, if after the accident the doctor who works on you commits malpractice and injures you further, the defense can argue that it was not the accident, but the incompetent doctor who caused your injury.|$|E

2500|$|Some Protestants, however, {{reject the}} {{position}} that contraceptive use {{is a matter of}} conscience. Although some Quiverfull adherents accept that birth control use is a matter of individual conscience, other such adherents <b>may</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the Bible commands their position for all Christians. For example, David Crank, publisher of Unless The Lord Magazine, states, [...] "The 'Quiverfull' approach is universal {{in the sense that it}} is not something unusual that only a few are called to. Rather it is God's basic design and plan for mankind, and it was the way most of mankind lived most of the time, until the 20th century." [...] Charles D. Provan additionally argues:"Be fruitful and multiply" ... is a command of God, indeed the first command to a married couple. Birth control obviously involves disobedience to this command, for birth control attempts to prevent being fruitful and multiplying. Therefore birth control is wrong, because it involves disobedience to the Word of God. Nowhere is this command done away with in the entire Bible; therefore it still remains valid for us today.|$|E

[...] All of these stamps are often found [...] "canceled to order", meaning they are postmarked without ever having passed through the postal system. Most national post offices produce stamps {{that would not be}} produced if there were no collectors, some to a far more prolific degree than others. It is up to individual collectors whether this concerns them; collecting such issues is as legitimate an endeavor as any other collection, but is unlikely to result in a collection of any value or to provide a monetary return on an investment (though it may be found worthwhile in other ways, such as teaching geography or collecting methods to a child, or sheer pleasure in the beauty of some of these issues).
