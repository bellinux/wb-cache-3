40|$|Background: A {{cross-sectional}} study {{to investigate the}} association of Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Asians (OSTA) score with clinical presentation and expenditure of hospitalized adult trauma patients with femoral fractures. Methods: According to the data retrieved from the Trauma Registry System between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2015, a total of 2086 patients aged ≥ 40 years and hospitalized for treatment of traumatic femoral bone fracture were categorized as high-risk patients (OSTA − 1, n = 638). Two-sided Pearson’s, chi-squared, or Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare categorical data. Unpaired Student’s t-test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used to analyze normally and non-normally distributed continuous data, respectively. Propensity-score matching in a 1 : 1 ratio was performed using Number Crunching Statistical Software (NCSS) software (NCSS 10; NCSS Statistical Software, Kaysville, UT, USA), with adjusted covariates including mechanism and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS); injuries were assessed based on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), and Injury Severity Score (ISS) {{was used to evaluate}} the effect of OSTA-related grouping on a patient’s outcome. Results: High-risk and <b>medium-risk</b> patients were predominantly female, presented with significantly older age and higher incidences of co-morbidity, and were injured in a fall accident more frequently than low-risk patients. High-risk patients and <b>medium-risk</b> patients had a different pattern of femoral fracture and a significantly lower ISS. Although high-risk and <b>medium-risk</b> patients had significantly shorter lengths hospital of stay (LOS) and less total expenditure than low-risk patients did, similar results were not found in the selected propensity score-matched patients, implying that the difference may be attributed to the associated injury severity of the patients with femoral fracture. However, the charge of surgery is significantly lower in high-risk and <b>medium-risk</b> patients than in low-risk patients, regardless of the total population or the selected propensity score-matched patients. This lower charge of surgery may be attributed to a less aggressive surgery applied for older patients with high or medium risk of osteoporosis. Conclusions: This study of hospitalized trauma patients with femoral fracture according to OSTA risk classification revealed that high-risk and <b>medium-risk</b> patients had significantly higher odds of sustaining injury in a fall accident than low-risk patients; they also present a different pattern of femoral bone fracture as well as a significantly lower ISS, shorter hospital LOS, and less total expenditure. In addition, the significantly lower charge of surgery in high-risk and <b>medium-risk</b> patients than in low-risk patients may be because of the preference of orthopedists for less aggressive surgery in dealing with older patients with osteoporotic femoral bone fracture...|$|E
40|$|Farthing (2005) {{tested a}} {{prediction}} derived from costly-signaling theory, that women would prefer physical risk takers (brave, athletic, fit) over risk-avoiders as long-term mates. Using scenarios involving high-risk acts, the prediction was confirmed for heroic (brave, altruistic) {{but not for}} non-heroic (brave, non-altruistic) acts. Apparently, women's concerns over risks to their mates overrode any positive signal value of men's risk taking, when the acts were highly risky and had no redeeming practical value. The present studies revisited the costly-signaling hypothesis using both medium- and high-risk scenarios, and {{it was predicted that}} for non-heroic acts women would prefer risk takers over risk avoiders for medium-level risks but not for highly risky acts. The prediction was supported in two studies. In Study 1, risk takers were preferred for non-heroic <b>medium-risk</b> acts, but risk avoiders were preferred for high-risk acts. For heroic acts, risk takers were preferred for both high- and <b>medium-risk</b> acts. Study 2 crossed two act risk levels with two actor skill levels, with non-heroic risks. Risk takers were preferred for the least risky combination (<b>medium-risk</b> act, high-skill actor) and also for the two moderately risky combinations, but risk avoiders were preferred for the riskiest combination (high-risk act, medium-skill actor). In Study 1, participants compared high-level risk takers versus risk avoiders on several person adjectives. Both heroic and non-heroic risk takers were perceived as more brave, athletic, physically fit, impulsive, attention-seeking, and foolish, and less emotionally stable and self-controlled, compared to risk avoiders. But only heroic risk takers were perceived as more altruistic, agreeable, conscientious, and sexy than risk avoiders...|$|E
40|$|Background: Osteoporotic {{fractures}} {{are defined}} as low-impact fractures resulting from low-level trauma. However, the exclusion of high-level trauma fractures may result in underestimation of the contribution of osteoporosis to fractures. In this study, we aimed to investigate the fracture patterns of female trauma patients with various risks of osteoporosis based on the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Asians (OSTA) score. Methods: According to the data retrieved from the Trauma Registry System of a Level I trauma center between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2015, a total of 6707 patients aged ≥ 40 years and hospitalized {{for the treatment of}} traumatic bone fracture were categorized as high-risk (OSTA − 1, n = 3137) patients. Two-sided Pearson’s, chi-squared, or Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare categorical data. Unpaired Student’s t-test and Mann–Whitney U-test were used to analyze normally and non-normally distributed continuous data, respectively. Propensity-score matching in a 1 : 1 ratio was performed with injury mechanisms as adjusted variables to evaluate the effects of OSTA-related grouping on the fracture patterns. Results: High- and <b>medium-risk</b> patients were significantly older, had higher incidences of comorbidity, and were more frequently injured from a fall and bicycle accident than low-risk patients did. Compared to low-risk patients, high- and <b>medium-risk</b> patients had a higher injury severity and mortality. In the propensity-score matched population, the incidence of fractures was only different in the extremity regions between high- and low-risk patients as well as between medium- and low-risk patients. The incidences of femoral fractures were significantly higher in high-risk (odds ratio [OR], 3. 4; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 73 – 4. 24; p < 0. 001) and <b>medium-risk</b> patients (OR, 1. 4; 95 % CI, 1. 24 – 1. 54; p < 0. 001) than in low-risk patients. In addition, high-risk patients had significantly lower odds of humeral, radial, patellar, and tibial fractures; however, such lower odds were not found in medium- risk than low-risk patients. Conclusions: The fracture patterns of female trauma patients with high- and <b>medium-risk</b> osteoporosis were different from that of low-risk patients exclusively in the extremity region...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to use a {{propensity}} score-matched analysis to investigate the association between the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Asians (OSTA) scores and clinical outcomes of patients with isolated moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: The study population comprised 7855 patients aged ≥ 40 years who were hospitalized for treatment of isolated moderate and severe TBI (an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) ≥ 3 points only in the head and not in other regions of the body) between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2014. Patients were categorized as high-risk (OSTA score − 1; n = 5359). Two-sided Pearson’s chi-squared, or Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare categorical data. Unpaired Student’s t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were performed to analyze normally and non-normally distributed continuous data, respectively. Propensity score-matching in a 1 : 1 ratio was performed using NCSS software, with adjustment for covariates. Results: Compared to low-risk patients, high- and <b>medium-risk</b> patients were significantly older and injured more severely. The high- and <b>medium-risk</b> patients had significantly higher mortality rates, longer hospital length of stay, and a higher proportion of admission to the intensive care unit than low-risk patients. Analysis of propensity score-matched patients with adjusted covariates, including gender, co-morbidity, blood alcohol concentration level, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and Injury Severity Score revealed that high- and <b>medium-risk</b> patients still had a 2. 4 -fold (odds ratio (OR), 2. 4; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 39 – 4. 15; p = 0. 001) and 1. 8 -fold (OR, 1. 8; 95 % CI, 1. 19 – 2. 86; p = 0. 005) higher mortality, respectively, than low-risk patients. However, further addition of age as a covariate for the propensity score-matching demonstrated that there was no significant difference between high-risk and low-risk patients or between <b>medium-risk</b> and low-risk patients, implying that older age may contribute to the significantly higher mortality associated with a lower OSTA score. Conclusions: Older age may be able to explain the association of lower OSTA score and higher mortality rates in patients with isolated moderate and severe TBI...|$|E

Eligible patients were aged at least 1 year, had haemoglobin SS or Sβ(0) thalassaemia sickle-cell-disease subtypes, and were scheduled for low-risk or <b>medium-risk</b> operations. Patients were randomly assigned no transfusion or transfusion no more than 10 days before surgery. The primary outcome was the proportion of clinically important complications between randomisation and 30 days after surgery. Analysis was by intention to treat. 67 (96 %) of 70 enrolled patients- 33 no preoperative transfusion and 34 preoperative transfusion-were assessed. 65 (97 %) of 67 patients had the haemoglobin SS subtype and 54 (81 %) were scheduled to undergo <b>medium-risk</b> surgery. 13 (39 %) of 33 patients in the no-preoperative-transfusion group had clinically important complications, compared with five (15 %) in the preoperative-transfusion group (p= 0. 023). Of these, 10 (30 %) and one (3 %), respectively, had serious adverse events. The unadjusted odds ratio of clinically important complications was 3. 8 (95 % CI 1. 2 - 12. 2, p= 0. 027). 10 (91 %) of 11 serious adverse events were acute chest syndrome (nine in the no-preoperative-transfusion group {{and one in the}} preoperative-transfusion group). Duration of hospital stay and readmission rates did not differ between study groups. Preoperative transfusion was associated with decreased perioperative complications in patients with sickle-cell disease in this trial.

40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the prognostic importance of platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutro - phil-lymphocyte ratio(NLR) combination for patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and its relationship with mortality. Methods: This retrospective study was included 142 patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Ranson, Atlanta and BISAP 0 h, 24 h and 48 h scores of the patients were calculated by examining their patient files. The patients were divided into three groups as low-risk, <b>medium-risk</b> and high-risk patients according to their PLR and NLR levels. Results: The number of patients with acute pancreatitis complications such as necrotizing pancreatitis, acute renal failure, sepsis and cholangitis was significantly higher in the high-risk group compared to other groups. Mortality rate {{was found to be}} 90 % in the high-risk group, 16 % in the <b>medium-risk</b> group, and 1. 9 % in the low-risk group. The number of patients with a Ranson score of 5 and 6, a severe Atlanta score, a BISAP 0 h score of 3 and 4, a BISAP 24 h and 48 h score of 4 and 5 was higher in the high-risk group compared to other groups. PLR-NLR combination, Atlanta and Ranson scores, and C-reactive protein level were determined to be independent risk factors predicting mortality in stepwise regression model. PLR-NLR combination had the highest area under curve value in terms of predicting acute claspancreatitis prognosis and had a similar diagnostic discrimination with other scoring systems. Conclusion: In our study it was found that PLR-NLR combination had a similar prognostic importance with other scoring systems used to determine acute pancreatitis prognosis...|$|E
30|$|On this basis, the {{toxicity}} {{risks of the}} metals in the runoff sediments of this work can be summarised as (1) Cd in the sediments is of very high risk as 73 % of it {{was found in the}} Fractions, F 1 and F 2, (2) 48 % Co appears in the fractions, F 1 and F 2 and, therefore, fall in the high-risk region, (3) The metals, Cu, Cr, Mn and Zn were present in the F 1 and F 2 fractions in 18, 16, 23 and 15 %, respectively, of the total of the five fractions and, therefore, with respect to each of these metals, the runoff sediments can be put in the <b>medium-risk</b> category.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Venous tromboembolism is an {{important}} factor of morbidity and mortality for hospitalized patients. Recently, despite the progression on diagnosis and treatment, diciplinary approaches to prophylaxis, consisting of a consensus cannot be applied. In this study, our aim was to determine the level of risk for DVT and PE who were operated in our clinic and to indicate the prevention by appropriate prophylaxis. Material and Methods: 432 patients, who were admitted to our clinic and underwent oncologic or laparoscopic operations between Jan. 2007 and Jan. 2010 were included in this study. The age, sex, duration of admission, risk levels for VTE, risk factors and results of prophylaxis were determined. Results: 214 patients were female and 218 were male. Mean age was 48 (24 - 80). The mean lenght of stay was 6 (2 - 25) days. Very-high-risk group included 19 patients (4, 4 %), whereas high-risk group included 49 (11, 3 %), <b>medium-risk</b> group included 71 (16, 4 %) and low-risk group included 293 (67, 9 %) patients. Prophylaxis included early mobilization for low-risk group, 2 doses of LMWH in 24 hours for <b>medium-risk</b> group, LMWH for 7 - 10 days for high-risk group and LMWH, antiembolic socks, early mobilization and IPC (intermittant pneumotic compression) for very-high risk group. 2 patients had DVT and 1 had PE under appropriate prophylaxis. No mortality occured. Conclusion: Pulmonary embolism is a preventable cause of death that among hospitalized patients. There is no consensus on prophylaxis in surgical clinics. DVT and VTE can be prevented by determining the risk levels of patients using scoring systems and administrating appropriate prophylaxis...|$|E
