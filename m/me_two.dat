Hitzfeld said that when he first left Bayern in 2004 he 'felt burnt out' and 'was a bit depressed', and 'it took <b>me</b> <b>two</b> years to recover.' He then had 'the best years at Bayern' on his return. He stated his views that people should not get too excited about things, not get too down about things, and treat each situation individually. His uncle was the World War II general Otto Hitzfeld.|$|E

500|$|Wilberforce's {{involvement}} in the abolition movement was motivated {{by a desire to}} put his Christian principles into action and to serve God in public life. He and other Evangelicals were horrified by what they perceived was a depraved and unChristian trade, and the greed and avarice of the owners and traders. Wilberforce sensed a call from God, writing in a journal entry in 1787 that [...] "God Almighty has set before <b>me</b> <b>two</b> great objects, the suppression of the Slave Trade and the Reformation of Manners [...] ". The conspicuous involvement of Evangelicals in the highly popular anti-slavery movement served to improve the status of a group otherwise associated with the less popular campaigns against vice and immorality.|$|E

Although he was in prison, Charles Burney purchased the [...] "Rules" [...] (allowing him some freedom), and Smart's final weeks may have been peaceful although pathetic. In his final letter, Smart begged for money from Rev.

[...] "Ten Simple Rules", described as having a [...] "Fifties twist" [...] sound, was originally included as music video on Hoop Dogz, a children's video DVD. Lyrically, it relates the Ten Commandments. The band had begun playing it in concerts and, according to Millard, it developed a following of fans who {{wanted it to be}} put on CD.

The {{attack on}} this fortified town proceeded along similar lines to that on Bardia, with the 16th Infantry effecting a break-in of the position, {{but this time}} the 19th Infantry Brigade was to carry out the exploitation phase. Robertson's contribution to the plan was to increase its tempo, so that the attack would be carried through without pause, the exploitation being carried out before the initial break-in was complete. Robertson accepted the surrender of the fortress commander, Generale di Corpo d'Armata Petassi Manella, and later Admiral Messimiliano Vietina, the Italian naval commander. Comments by [...] "a sunburnt red-headed Australian brigadier" [...] made headlines in Britain, where senior officers rarely spoke to the media, but did not endear Robertson to his critics, who felt that his ego was out of control. Following the entry of the 19th Infantry Brigade to Benghazi on 7 February, Robertson declared [...] "give <b>me</b> <b>two</b> stout ships and a bearing on Rome and we'll dine in the hall of the caesars".|$|E

500|$|Zeta-Jones {{participated in}} school stage shows {{from a young}} age and gained local media {{attention}} when her rendition of a Shirley Bassey song won a Junior Star Trail talent competition. As part of a dance troupe, she routinely took trips to London, where she auditioned for roles in the theatre. At the age of nine, she was selected to play one of the orphan girls in a West End production of the musical Annie, and in her early teens, she became a national tap-dancing champion. In 1981 she played the lead role of Annie in a Swansea production of the musical, which was staged at the Swansea Grand Theatre. Two years later, she played the lead role of Tallulah in a West End production of Bugsy Malone. When she was 15, Zeta-Jones {{dropped out of school}} without obtaining O-levels and decided to live in London to pursue a full-time acting career; she was also engaged to perform in a touring production of The Pajama Game. Describing her teenage years in London, Zeta-Jones said, [...] "I would queue up for auditions and then change my costume or put on a different leotard and audition again. It might take <b>me</b> <b>two</b> tries, but I always got the job. I figured out what they wanted". She went on to attend the independent Arts Educational Schools in Chiswick, London, for a three-year course in musical theatre.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{began writing}} the series very early on, hoping to avoid {{publication}} delays {{such as those}} faced by the DC limited series Camelot 3000. When writing the script for the first issue, Moore said he realized, [...] "I only had enough plot for six issues. We were contracted for 12!" [...] His solution was to alternate issues that dealt with the overall plot of the series with origin issues for the characters. Moore wrote very detailed scripts for Gibbons to work from. Gibbons recalled that [...] "he script for {{the first issue of}} Watchmen was, I think, 101 pages of typescriptâsingle-spacedâwith no gaps between the individual panel descriptions or, indeed, even between the pages." [...] Upon receiving the scripts, the artist had to number each page [...] "in case I drop them on the floor, because it would take <b>me</b> <b>two</b> days to put them back in the right order", and used a highlighter pen to single out lettering and shot descriptions; he remarked, [...] "It takes quite a bit of organizing before you can actually put pen to paper." [...] Despite Moore's detailed scripts, his panel descriptions would often end with the note [...] "If that doesn't work for you, do what works best"; Gibbons nevertheless worked to Moore's instructions. In fact, Gibbons only suggested a single change to the script: a compression of Ozymandias' narration while he was preventing a sneak attack by Rorschach, as he felt that the dialog was too long to fit with the amount of action expressed; Moore agreed and re-wrote the scene. Gibbons {{had a great deal of}} autonomy in developing the visual look of Watchmen, and frequently inserted background details that Moore admitted he did not notice until later. Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer Neil Gaiman for answers to research questions and for quotes to include in issues.|$|E
