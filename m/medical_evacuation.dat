5|$|The 55th Rescue Squadron {{operates}} the Sikorsky HH-60G Pave Hawk and deploys combat rescue forces worldwide. It employs its helicopter and aircrews in hostile environments to recover downed aircrew and isolated personnel during day, night, or marginal weather conditions. The squadron also conducts civil search and rescue, disaster relief, international aid, emergency <b>medical</b> <b>evacuation,</b> and counter-drug activities.|$|E
5|$|Recently, Israel has {{modified}} {{a number}} of its Merkava main battle tanks with ambulance features {{in order to allow}} rescue operations to take place under heavy fire in urban warfare. The modifications were made following a failed rescue attempt in which Palestinian gunmen killed two soldiers who were providing aid for a Palestinian woman in Rafah. Since M-113 armored personnel carriers and regular up-armored ambulances are not sufficiently protected against anti-tank weapons and improvised explosive devices, it was decided to use the heavily armored Merkava tank. Its rear door enables the evacuation of critically wounded soldiers. Israel did not remove the Merkava's weaponry, claiming that weapons were more effective protection than emblems since Palestinian militants would disregard any symbols of protection and fire at ambulances anyway. For use as ground ambulances and treatment & evacuation vehicles, the United States military currently employs the M113, the M577, the M1133 Stryker <b>Medical</b> <b>Evacuation</b> Vehicle (MEV), and the RG-33 Heavily Armored Ground Ambulance (HAGA) as treatment and evacuation vehicles, with contracts to incorporate the newly designed M2A0 Armored <b>Medical</b> <b>Evacuation</b> Vehicle (AMEV), a variant of the M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle (formerly known as the ATTV).|$|E

5|$|The Army {{was using}} an {{incremental}} approach to combat vehicle modernization, {{centered on the}} Ground Combat Vehicle. The deployment was to be synchronized with upgrades, reset, and divestiture of existing vehicles. Vehicles displaced by the IFV may then replace selected M113 family of vehicles such as command and control, <b>medical</b> <b>evacuation,</b> and mortar carrier, allowing the Army to begin divestiture of the M113 family of vehicles. Upgrades to existing Bradley and Stryker vehicles may have been considered as risk mitigation based on {{the rate at which}} the GCV was introduced. Although upgraded, the Bradley and Stryker would also be replaced in the midterm.|$|E

Based on his experiences in South Africa, Chauvel propounded ideas {{on the nature of}} mounted infantry. He recommended that Australian troops improve their discipline in the field, called for stronger leadership from officers, and emphasised the need for better organisation for supply and for timely and efficient <b>medical</b> <b>evacuation.</b>|$|E

5|$|Military {{ambulances}} {{have historically}} included vehicles based on civilian designs {{and at times}} also included armored, but unarmed, vehicles ambulances based upon armoured personnel carriers (APCs). In the Second World War vehicles such as the Hanomag Sd Kfz 251 halftrack were pressed into service as ad hoc ambulances, and in more recent times purpose built AFVs such as the U.S. M1133 <b>Medical</b> <b>Evacuation</b> Vehicle serve the exclusive purpose of armored medical vehicles. Civilian based designs may be painted in appropriate colours, depending on the operational requirements (i.e. camouflage for field use, white for United Nations peacekeeping, etc.). For example, the British Royal Army Medical Corps has a fleet of white ambulances, based on production trucks. Military helicopters have also served both as ad hoc and purpose-built air ambulances, since they are extremely useful for MEDEVAC.|$|E
5|$|No.30 Communications Flight was re-designated No.30 Communications Unit in November 1950, and No.30 Transport Unit a year later, before re-forming as No.36 (Transport) Squadron in March 1953. It {{undertook}} <b>medical</b> <b>evacuation,</b> cargo and troop transport, and courier flights. No.77 Squadron {{converted to}} Gloster Meteor jets between April and July 1951, and operated {{primarily in the}} ground attack role from December that year. It remained in Korea on garrison duty following the July 1953 armistice, and returned to Australia in November 1954; No.491 Squadron disbanded the same month. No.36 Squadron returned to Australia in March 1955, leaving four aircraft to equip the newly formed RAAF Transport Flight (Japan), which briefly came under No.91 Wing's control. The following month, No.391 Squadron and No.91 Wing headquarters were disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Twelve C-130Js are {{operated}} by No.37 Squadron, also based at Richmond under No.84 Wing. The aircraft are generally crewed by two pilots and a loadmaster, and are tasked with medium tactical airlift in Australia and overseas, transporting troops and cargo, and conducting <b>medical</b> <b>evacuation,</b> search-and-rescue, and airdrop missions. No.285 Squadron manages the full-flight mission simulator (FFMS) used to convert aircrew to the C-130J, {{as well as}} decommissioned Hercules airframes used for loadmaster training. It also employs computer-based training tools and is allocated flying aircraft from No.37 Squadron when required. As well as training aircrew new to the C-130J, the FFMS (maintained by CAE Australia) is employed for existing aircrew to maintain their currency.|$|E

5|$|On 4 August 1995, the CAF had at its {{disposal}} 17 MiG-21s, five {{attack and}} nine transport helicopters, three transport airplanes and two reconnaissance aircraft. On that {{first day of the}} operation, thirteen MiG-21s were used to destroy or disable six targets in the Gospić and Zagreb Corps AORs, at the cost of one severely and three slightly damaged jets. The same day, three Mi-8s were used for <b>medical</b> <b>evacuation.</b> US Navy EA-6Bs and F/A-18s on patrol as part of Operation Deny Flight fired on ARSK surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites at Udbina and Knin as SAM radars locked onto the jets. A few sources claim that they were deployed as a deterrent as the UN troops came under HV fire, and a subsequent UN Security Council report only notes that the deployment was a result of the deterioration of the military situation and resulting low security of the peacekeepers in the area. Also on 4 August, the RSK 105th Air Force Brigade based at Udbina, deployed helicopters against the Croatian special police on Velebit Mountain and against targets in the Gospić area virtually to no effect.|$|E
5|$|No.38 Squadron {{received}} the RAAF's first de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou tactical transports in April 1964, replacing its Dakotas. The first six Caribous were despatched that August to South East Asia for {{service in the}} Vietnam War as RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam (RTFV). The same month, No.86 Wing was disbanded. Because the Caribous were primarily for support of the Australian Army, an overarching wing headquarters for the Caribous and Hercules was now considered inappropriate. No.486 Squadron was also disbanded and its equipment and staff divided between Nos.36 and 38 Squadrons, which along with AMTF became independently operating units {{under the command of}} Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond. Following the re-establishment at Richmond of No.37 Squadron in February 1966, flying C-130E Hercules, No.486 Squadron was re-formed to provide maintenance for both Hercules squadrons. As No.36 Squadron's tasking was mainly tactical and No.37 Squadron's strategic (owing to the longer range of its C-130Es), forming the Hercules units into a new wing was not deemed necessary. Still based at Richmond, the Hercules provided long-range transport and <b>medical</b> <b>evacuation</b> services to and from South East Asia during the Vietnam War. No.36 Squadron's C-130As were replaced by C-130H models in 1978. RTFV was re-formed as No.35 Squadron in June 1966, and continued to serve in Vietnam until Australian forces were withdrawn in 1972; it was then based in Richmond until 1976, when it relocated to RAAF Base Townsville, Queensland. No.38 Squadron meanwhile continued to operate Caribous out of Richmond until 1992, when it transferred to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland. In the Vietnam and post-Vietnam eras, along with their military transport duties, the Hercules and Caribou undertook disaster relief operations throughout Australia and the Pacific.|$|E
