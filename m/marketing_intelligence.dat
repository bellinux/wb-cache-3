50|$|<b>Marketing</b> <b>{{intelligence}}</b> {{determines the}} intelligence needed, collects it by searching environment and delivers it to marketing managers who need it. <b>Marketing</b> <b>intelligence</b> software can be deployed using an on-premises or software {{as a service}} (SaaS, or cloud-based) model. These systems take data from disparate data sources, like web analytics, business intelligence, call center and sales data, which often come separate reports, and put them into a single environment. In order to collect <b>marketing</b> <b>intelligence,</b> marketing managers must be in constant touch with relevant books, newspapers and trade publications. They must talk to various stakeholders like customers, distributors, and suppliers. In addition to this, they must also monitor social media and carry out online discussions. Marketing managers can design reports that correlate and visualize data coming from a variety of departments and sources (even, in some cases, external data.) This allows them to see current key performance indicators in real time (or as quickly as sources provide data) and analyze trends, rather than wait for analysts to deliver periodic reports.|$|E
