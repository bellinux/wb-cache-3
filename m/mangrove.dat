5|$|Arboreal carton nests of <b>mangrove</b> swamp-dwelling Nasutitermes are {{enriched in}} lignin and {{depleted}} in cellulose and xylans. This change {{is caused by}} bacterial decay in the gut of the termites: they use their faeces as a carton building material. Arboreal termites nests can account {{for as much as}} 2% of above ground carbon storage in Puerto Rican <b>mangrove</b> swamps. These Nasutitermes nests are mainly composed of partially biodegraded wood material from the stems and branches of <b>mangrove</b> trees, namely, Rhizophora mangle (red <b>mangrove),</b> Avicennia germinans (black <b>mangrove)</b> and Laguncularia racemose (white <b>mangrove).</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{ecosystems}} such as <b>mangrove</b> swamps, trees {{play a role}} {{in developing}} the habitat, since the roots of the <b>mangrove</b> trees reduce the speed of flow of tidal currents and trap water-borne sediment, reducing the water depth and creating suitable conditions for further <b>mangrove</b> colonisation. Thus <b>mangrove</b> swamps tend to extend seawards in suitable locations. <b>Mangrove</b> swamps also provide an effective buffer against the more damaging effects of cyclones and tsunamis.|$|E

The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis), sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and molluscs. The shellfish population consists mostly of <b>mangrove</b> oysters (Crassostrea gasar), which cling to uncovered <b>mangrove</b> roots at low tide. The red-headed agama and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mangrove</b> trees {{cover the}} coastlines of South Florida, {{sometimes}} growing inland {{depending on the}} amount of salt water present within the Everglades ecosystems. During drier years when less fresh water flows to the coast, mangroves will appear among fresh water plants. When rain is abundant, sawgrass and other fresh water plants may be found closer to the coast. Three species of <b>mangrove</b> trees—red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa)—can be found in the Everglades. Due to their high tolerance of salt water, winds, extreme tides, high temperatures, and muddy soils, <b>mangrove</b> trees are uniquely adapted to extreme conditions. They act as nurseries for many marine and bird species. They are also Florida's first defense against the destructive forces of hurricanes, absorbing flood waters and preventing coastal erosion. The <b>mangrove</b> system in Everglades National Park is the largest continuous system of mangroves in the world.|$|E

40|$|A plant’s {{adaptation}} to its environment {{is one of}} the most important issues in evolutionary biology. <b>Mangroves</b> are trees that inhabit the intertidal zones with high salinity, while salt tolerance competence of different species varies. Even congeneric species usually occupy distinct positions of intertidal zones due to differential ability of salt tolerance. Some species have different ecotypes that adapt well to littoral and terrestrial environments, respectively. These characteristics of <b>mangroves</b> make them ideal ecological models to study adaptation of <b>mangroves</b> to salinity. Here, we briefly depict adaptive traits of salt tolerance in <b>mangroves</b> with respect to anatomy, physiology and biochemistry, and review the major advances recently made on both the genetic and genomic levels. Results from studies on individual genes or whole genomes of <b>mangroves</b> have confirmed conclusions drawn from studies on anatomy, physiology and biochemistry, and have further indicated that specific patterns of gene expression might contribute to adaptive evolution of <b>mangroves</b> under high salinity. By integrating all information from <b>mangroves</b> and performing comparisons among species of <b>mangroves</b> and non-mangroves, we could give a general picture of adaptation of <b>mangroves</b> to salinity, thus providing a new avenue for further studies on a molecular basis of adaptive evolution of <b>mangroves.</b> <b>mangroves,</b> salt stress, adaptive evolution, gene, genom...|$|R

5|$|Solitary in nature, the <b>mangrove</b> whipray preys {{mainly on}} small, bottom-dwelling bony fishes and invertebrates. It is, like other stingrays, aplacental viviparous, with the females nourishing their unborn young via histotroph ("uterine milk"). The <b>mangrove</b> whipray is caught for its meat, skin, and {{cartilage}} {{across much of}} its range. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable globally and as Endangered in Southeast Asia, where its population has declined substantially due to intensive artisanal and commercial fisheries as well as widespread habitat degradation. In particular, juvenile rays have been disproportionately targeted by fishers and affected by the large-scale destruction of <b>mangrove</b> forests.|$|E
5|$|The boardwalk was {{constructed}} in 1984 by the City of Salisbury to encourage appreciation of the mangrove's ecological importance. On 29 April 1995, South Australian Premier Dean Brown and federal MP Chris Schacht opened the St Kilda Interpretative Centre {{at the entrance to}} the boardwalk which showcases the flora, fauna and processes within the <b>mangrove</b> forest. Since 1997 the <b>mangrove</b> trail has been privately managed, hosting school visits as well as casual visitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela mostly inhabits mangroves in monsoonal coastal areas, especially thickets of spotted <b>mangrove</b> (Rhizophora stylosa), smallflower bruguiera (Bruguiera parviflora) and grey <b>mangrove</b> (Avicennia marina) bordering islands or in river deltas, but {{it often}} also occurs in paperbark thickets fringing the mangroves {{such as those}} of cajeput (Melaleuca leucadendra). It is a <b>mangrove</b> specialist, an adaptation that probably occurred as northern Australia became more arid and the bird populations became dependent on mangroves as other types of forest disappeared. The mangroves provide nectar and insects as well as shelter and nesting sites, and they supply the majority of the species' needs for most of the year. In Australia, <b>mangrove</b> vegetation forms a narrow discontinuous strip along thousands of kilometres of coastline, accommodating birds specialized for the habitat. Eighty Mile Beach in Western Australia has no mangroves and no fringing Melaleuca forests, reducing its potential for successful colonization by nectarivores, and it marks the southern limit of the red-headed myzomela in Western Australia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mangroves</b> protect {{coastal areas}} from erosion, storm surge, and tsunamis.

5|$|The suburb was {{originally}} three low lying islands that {{were covered in}} shell grit and saltbush and surrounded by <b>mangrove</b> and samphire swamps. Fishermen had established huts on the islands by 1865 and by 1873 there were 13 huts and a boathouse recorded when the area was surveyed by Thomas Evans. By the 1890s people were visiting the islands attracted to the supposed curative properties of the <b>mangrove</b> mud, using the beach for bathing and fishing for crabs.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{make their}} homes within holes in various <b>mangrove</b> trees and {{maintain}} an arboreal existence whereas the young are strictly terrestrial {{for the first}} year of their lives. As the Utila iguana cannot successfully lay its eggs in the <b>mangrove</b> swamps, the gravid females are forced to migrate to nearby sandy beaches in order to bury their clutches of eggs so they can incubate in the hot sun. After digging their nest burrows and laying their eggs, the females abandon the nests and return to the mangroves. Sixty to seventy-four days later the hatchlings emerge and move back to the swamps.|$|E

5|$|The <b>mangrove</b> whipray {{is capable}} of {{injuring}} a human with its venomous sting. It is occasionally caught in tangle nets and bottom trawls, {{and to a lesser}} extent on longlines; it is marketed for its meat, skin, and cartilage. Because of its inshore habitat preferences, this naturally uncommon species is highly susceptible to intensive artisanal and commercial fishing occurring across much of its range. In Southeast Asia, immature rays have been particularly affected by local fishing, as well as by habitat degradation from the widespread loss of <b>mangrove</b> forests. Additionally, the numbers of this species in the Arafura Sea have dropped significantly due to an Indonesian gillnet fishery targeting wedgefishes (Rhynchobatus), which involves over 600 vessels and has been increasingly operating illegally in Australian waters. These factors have led to an inferred decline of the Southeast Asian population by over 50%, leading the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to give it a regional assessment of Endangered. The <b>mangrove</b> whipray is minimally threatened off northern Australia, where it is caught incidentally by the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF) but only in small numbers following the mandatory adoption of Turtle Exclusion Devices (TEDs). As a result, the IUCN assessment for the Australian population is Least Concern. Globally, the IUCN has listed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
