25|$|I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> in Mauritania, {{freedom is}} total: freedom of thought, {{equality}} – {{of all men}} and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, this is in the past. There are probably former relationships – slavery relationships and familial relationships from old days and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But (slavery) is something that is totally finished. All people are free in Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. And I believe that I can tell you that no one profits from this commerce.|$|E

"Dear Lucy, Your letter gave {{me quite}} a shock, fancy you wanting to draw four pounds {{to buy a}} brooch, ring, bangle, work basket, tea set, etc, etc. [...] I am quite sure Mrs. Henry would expend the money {{carefully}} for you, but I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> no Aborigine can draw 4/5 of their wages unless they are sick and in hospital and require {{the money to buy}} comforts... However, as it is Christmas I will let you have 1/5/ – out of your banking account to buy lollies with." ...|$|E
500|$|He walked under guard from St James's Palace, {{where he}} had been confined, to the Palace of Whitehall, where an {{execution}} scaffold was erected in front of the Banqueting House. Charles was separated from spectators by large ranks of soldiers, and his last speech reached only those with him on the scaffold. He blamed his fate on his failure to prevent the execution of his loyal servant Strafford: [...] "An unjust sentence that I suffered to take effect, is punished now by an unjust sentence on me." [...] He declared that he had desired the liberty and freedom of the people as much as any, [...] "but I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> their liberty and freedom consists in having government... It is not their having a share in the government; that is nothing appertaining unto them. A subject and a sovereign are clean different things." [...] He continued, [...] "I shall go from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown, where no disturbance can be." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{making his}} way there he ran into the French fleet on 9 June, the French having sailed from Toulon some days earlier and headed east along the coast. Despite {{pressing}} on sail Speedy was overrun and captured. Eyre was taken aboard one of the French ships, and later transferred to the flagship of the fleet's commander, Rear-Admiral Pierre Martin. Martin {{asked him if he}} had heard of the decree from the National Convention which declared that 'no quarter should be given to either the English or the Hanoverians'. Eyre replied that they had not, on which he was told by Martin that [...] "...I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> it is now un guerre à mort and if I had been the first to come alongside of you, I should have instantly sent you to the bottom." [...] At this point the main British fleet was seen approaching, and Eyre was hurried back to the first ship he had been brought onto, and the French hurried into Gourjean roads, taking Speedy and the captured British crew with them.|$|E
2500|$|I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you...</b> <b>that</b> what we {{have got}} {{is an attempt to}} {{substitute}} the rule of the mob for the rule of law, and it must not succeed. [...] It must not succeed. There are those who are using violence and intimidation to impose their will on others who do not want it.... The rule of law must prevail over the rule of the mob.|$|E
2500|$|After the Soviet Union {{broke apart}} in the early 1990s, Leningrad reverted to its {{original}} name of Saint Petersburg, and a private delegation visited Ilyinsky while he served on Palm Beach City Council {{to ask him to}} return to Russia to claim the throne as tsar. Ilyinsky said, [...] "Gentlemen, I could not be more pleased and flattered at your invitation, but I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I am entirely satisfied with my present occupation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{many times}} <b>must</b> I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{my name is}} not Tubby or Tubblets. It is William Philander Tubbs, and I want you to call me by my right name after this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I do {{dwell on}} it," [...] he {{answered}} earnestly, a red spot showing on either cheek. [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> sir, <b>that</b> {{we are very}} likely indeed to fall into an enemy's hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dorothy," [...] I began, [...] "I <b>must</b> first <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I {{have some}} {{guess at the}} {{sacrifice}} you are making for my sake, and of the trouble and danger which I bring you." ...|$|R
2500|$|This was {{the first}} time an organic {{compound}} was artificially synthesized from inorganic starting materials, without the involvement of living organisms. [...] The results of this experiment implicitly discredited vitalism— the theory that the chemicals of living organisms are fundamentally different from those of inanimate matter. [...] This insight was important for the development of organic chemistry. His discovery prompted Wöhler to write triumphantly to Berzelius: [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I can make urea without the use of kidneys, either man or dog. Ammonium cyanate is urea." [...] In fact, this was incorrect. These are two different chemicals, which are in chemical equilibrium heavily favoring urea under standard conditions. Regardless, with his discovery, Wöhler secured a place among the pioneers of organic chemistry.|$|E

6000|$|... "Cap'n Kittridge!" [...] {{said his}} helpmeet, drawing herself up, and giving him an austere glance over her spectacles; [...] "how often <b>must</b> I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> there is {{subjects}} which shouldn't {{be treated with}} levity?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{can you be}} so absurd?" [...] {{cried the}} queen. [...] "How often <b>must</b> I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> there are no fairies? And even if there were--but, no matter; pray let us drop the subject." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{you know}} why I shrank from calling you my son, knowing that {{when the time came}} for you to be told of your parentage, I <b>must</b> also <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> your father was a murderer!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall answer no such question," [...] said she; [...] "and what is more, I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{nothing can}} justify your asking it. Good morning!" ...|$|E

[Sidenote: Sir Launcelot confesses himself] [...] "Ha, Sir Tristram," [...] {{said the}} white knight, [...] "often have I heard of thee and of thy skill at arms, and well have I proved thy fame {{this day and}} that all that is said of thee is true. I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> <b>that</b> I have never yet met my match until I met thee this day.

6000|$|... "I {{like you}} very much; but, if you please, we won't analyse. Pardon me if I seem patronising, but I think you a perfect little gentleman. I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> however, <b>that</b> I've not the marrying of Pansy Osmond." ...|$|R

Still I <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> <b>that</b> a mask was never yet put before my face; for what reason can there be why one who rises with the sun to go to his toil, who trusteth to the favor of the blessed St. Anthony for the little he hath, should go abroad like a gallant, ready to steal the good name of a virgin, or a robber at night?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Arthur's young brow wore {{a look of}} deep thought; at last he said, [...] "Do not go then, Gaston. If I {{have done}} wrong, I must bear the blame, and, be it as it may, my uncle needs <b>must</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all <b>that</b> I may tell him." ...|$|R
