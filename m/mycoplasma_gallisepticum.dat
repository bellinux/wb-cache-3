Delayed footpad swelling was not detected in mice pretreated only with nonviable M. pulmonis or DS followed by footpad injection with nonviable M. pulmonis. Subcutaneous pretreatment in the scruff of the neck with nonviable M. pulmonis and DS was more effective in eliciting delayed footpad swelling than intravenous or intraperitoneal pretreatment.

Materials and Methods: On the basis of native Hens distribution, this region divided into four parts of Eghlid, Doskord, Sedeh and Hasan-abad. Fifty unvaccinated native Hens randomly selected from each part. Blood samples were aseptically collected from the wing veins using 5 -ml sterile syringe. Serum from hens was tested for detection and titration for Mycoplasma and Salmonella by the rapid slide agglutination method, and was tested for influenza and Newcastle by the Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay. The data was analyzed completely in randomized design with four treatments, 50 repetitions for each disease. Results: 34 out of 200 samples (17 %) were positive for influenza. There were significant differences between regions (p< 0. 01). 38 out of 200 samples (19 %) were positive for Newcastle. The maximum infectious rate obtained from Eghlid.
