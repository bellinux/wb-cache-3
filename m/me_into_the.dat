25|$|My first well-remembered {{intentional}} use of {{the double}} bind occurred in early boyhood. One winter day, with the weather below zero, my father led a calf {{out of the barn}} to the water trough. After the calf had satisfied its thirst, they turned back to the barn, but at the doorway the calf stubbornly braced its feet, and despite my father's desperate pulling on the halter, he could not budge the animal. I was outside playing in the snow and, observing the impasse, began laughing heartily. My father challenged me to pull the calf into the barn. Recognizing the situation as one of unreasoning stubborn resistance {{on the part of the}} calf, I decided to let the calf have full opportunity to resist, since that was what it apparently wished to do. Accordingly I presented the calf with a double bind by seizing it by the tail and pulling it away from the barn, while my father continued to pull it inward. The calf promptly chose to resist the weaker of the two forces and dragged <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> barn. Reprinted in Collected Papers Volume 3.|$|E

[...] Upon signing the contract he stated, [...] "I wanted to retire as a Giant because it's where my career began.

Carr said [...] "When I first started on SpongeBob, my duties were mainly music editorial but would quickly thrust <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> composers/supervisor chair." [...] The production team had no budget and no music but they placed the budget on the song called [...] "Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight". Carr said [...] " [...] a sadly familiar scenario with most cartoons for television. By the time it comes to consider the music, the budget is blown." ...|$|E
500|$|Massa's {{touch on}} Hamilton's car on lap two was {{labelled}} by the McLaren driver [...] "as deliberate {{as it could}} be". Massa rejected the allegation, saying [...] "I had two wheels on the gravel. I could not stop the car and I was on the gravel because he pushed <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gravel." [...] Media coverage of the incident suggested that though the contact was Massa's fault, it was unintentional. Simon Arron, writing for The Daily Telegraph, said Hamilton's accusation of deliberate contact was [...] "unworthy and unwise", adding that the contact was simply a racing incident. The gap between the drivers in the Drivers' Championship after the race stood at five points, in Hamilton's favour, with two races remaining. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren's failure to score points, combined with Ferrari's third and seventh, moved Ferrari to a seven-point lead.|$|E

500|$|In July, Dylan {{appeared}} at the second Newport Folk Festival. That weekend, Peter, Paul and Mary's rendition of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] reached number two on Billboards pop chart. Baez was also at Newport, appearing twice on stage with Dylan. The combination of the chart success of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", and the glamor of Baez and Dylan singing together generated excitement about Dylan and his new album. Tom Paxton recalled: [...] "That was a big breakout festival for Bob. The buzz kept growing exponentially {{and it was like}} a coronation of Bob and Joan. They were King and Queen of the festival". His friend Bob Fass recalled that after Newport, Dylan told him that [...] "suddenly I just can't walk around without a disguise. I used to walk around and go wherever I wanted.

500|$|Series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone {{were the}} {{executive}} {{producers of the}} 13th season of South Park, along with Anne Garefino. The season was distributed by Comedy Central, where the series has aired {{since its inception in}} 1997. Frank C. Agnone II served as supervising producer, while Eric Stough, Adrien Beard, Vernon Chatman, Bruce Howell and Erica Rivinoja worked as producers. Parker also served as director and writer for the thirteenth season. Saturday Night Live cast member Bill Hader, who had previously worked as a consultant on the show, was credited as a producer starting in season 13. Hader said of his role with the show, [...] "It's really Trey and Matt who kind of write everything, and you're just in the room kind of helping them. Basically, I'm friends with them and they're just nice enough to invite <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room and let me goof around." [...] Ryan Quincy served as director of animation during the 13th season.|$|E
500|$|After {{staying with}} the show for eight seasons, Gray ran into trouble when she {{requested}} the producers of the show to adjust her contract {{to allow her to}} direct, as did the contracts of male co-stars Duffy and Hagman. The request initially led to producers' firing the actress from the serial, though the decision was later reversed when Dallas star Larry Hagman threatened to quit the show unless Gray were rehired. Gray stated in an interview with TV Guide, [...] "The producers said, 'But you're doing so well.' I thought, 'Oh, look out! I'm on the warpath now.' It was a struggle, though, because it was a man's show. And they fired me. When I finally told Larry, he went with <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> office and said, 'If she doesn't come back, I don't come back. I can't be playing J.R. Ewing without Sue Ellen.' He was very loyal and, honestly, a very smart businessman. He knew that truly, it was a huge relationship to the show." [...] We'll drink to that!" ...|$|E

500|$|On 29 September 1930, Waugh was {{received}} into the Catholic Church. This shocked {{his family and}} surprised some of his friends, but he had contemplated the step for some time. He had lost his Anglicanism at Lancing and had led an irreligious life at Oxford, but there are references in his diaries from the mid-1920s to religious discussion and regular churchgoing. On 22 December 1925, Waugh wrote: [...] "Claud and I took Audrey to supper and sat up until 7 in the morning arguing about the Roman Church". The entry for 20 February 1927 includes, [...] "I am to visit a Father Underhill about being a parson". Throughout the period, Waugh was influenced by his friend Olivia Plunket-Greene, who had converted in 1925 and of whom Waugh later wrote, [...] "She bullied <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Church". It was she who led him to Father Martin D'Arcy, a Jesuit, who persuaded Waugh [...] "on firm intellectual convictions but little emotion" [...] that [...] "the Christian revelation was genuine". In 1949, Waugh explained that his conversion followed his realisation that life was [...] "unintelligible and unendurable without God".|$|E
500|$|The album's {{production}} expanded on that of The Chronic, with new, sparse {{beats and}} reduced use of samples which were prominent on his debut album. Co-producer Scott Storch talked of how Dr. Dre used his collaborators during recording sessions: [...] "At the time, I saw Dr. Dre desperately needed something. He needed a fuel injection, and Dre utilized {{me as the}} nitrous oxide. He threw <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mix, and I sort of tapped on a new flavor with my whole piano sound and the strings and orchestration. So I'd be on the keyboards, and Mike [...] was on the bass guitar, and Dre was on the drum machine." [...] Josh Tyrangiel of Time has described the recording process which Dr. Dre employs, stating [...] "Every Dre track begins the same way, with Dre behind a drum machine {{in a room full}} of trusted musicians. (They carry beepers. When he wants to work, they work.) He'll program a beat, then ask the musicians to play along; when Dre hears something he likes, he isolates the player and tells him how to refine the sound." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{had also}} been some time since a Copland piece had been {{appreciated}} widely by audiences. His opera The Tender Land had not fared well, either in its original or revised forms. Choreographer Jerome Robbins never produced Copland's ballet Dance Panels, {{despite the fact that}} he had commissioned it. None of his major orchestral works from the 1960s—Connotations, Music for a Great City, Emblems and Inscape—made much of an impact with audiences. Nor do they fit in either the populist or modernist parts of Copland's compositional output. [...] Copland was aware that dodecaphonism did not hold as high a place as it had previously and writes, [...] "By the sixties, serialism had been around for over fifty years; young composers were not so fascinated with it anymore." [...] Nonetheless, he did not want to be pigeonholed. He told American composer Walter Piston in 1963, [...] "People always want to shove <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> American idea more than I really want. Nobody wants to be an 'American' composer now as they did." [...] He told another friend, [...] "Young composers today wouldn't be caught dead with a folk tune!" [...] He heard a considerable amount of new music through his association with Tanglewood and might not have wanted to be left behind. At the same time, he might not have become totally at home with serialism. He confided to Verna Fine, [...] "I don't feel comfortable with the twelve-tone system, but I don't want to keep repeating myself." ...|$|E

500|$|Teaching {{was one of}} the few careers {{then open}} to educated working-class girls, and in 1906 Ellen won a bursary of £25 that enabled her to begin her training. For half the week she {{attended}} the Manchester Day Training College, and during the other half taught at Oswald Road Elementary School. Her classroom approach—she sought to interest her pupils, rather than impose learning by rote—led to frequent clashes with her superiors, and convinced her that her future did not lie in teaching. At the college, where she was encouraged to read more widely and to engage with the issues of the day, she discovered socialism through the works of Robert Blatchford. By this time she was impatient with religion; socialism provided a timely and attractive substitute. At 16 she joined the Longsight branch of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and at one of her first branch meetings encountered Katherine Bruce Glasier, whose crusading brand of socialism made a deep impact. Thirty years later Wilkinson told her colleague George Middleton that Glasier had [...] "brought <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Socialist movement... It always makes me humble to think of her indomitable courage". After meeting the suffragist Hannah Mitchell, Wilkinson took up the cause of women's suffrage, the major women's rights issue of the day. Although initially engaged in everyday tasks such as distributing leaflets and putting up posters, she made a considerable impression on Mitchell, who later remembered her as [...] "brilliant and gifted".|$|E
500|$|Imperial Bedrooms {{opens with}} an {{acknowledgement}} from Clay, the main character, {{that both the}} Less Than Zero novel and its film adaption are actual representational works within the narrative of his life: [...] "The movie {{was based on a}} book by someone we knew... It was labeled fiction but only a few details had been altered and our names weren't changed and there was nothing in it that hadn't happened." [...] The Los Angeles Times described this as a [...] "nifty little trick", as it allows Ellis to establish the newer book [...] "as the primary narrative, one that trumps Ellis as author and the real world." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle calls it a [...] "neat trick of authorial self-abnegation". Another reviewer describes it as Ellis at [...] "his most ambitious", a [...] "Philip Rothian, doppelgänger gambit", making his new narrator [...] "the real Clay" [...] and the other an imposter. This allows Ellis to skilfully, [...] "with writerly jujitsu", acknowledge Robert Downey Jr.'s popular performance as Julian in the moralistic 1987 film, in which he died; Ellis appreciates the adaptation as a [...] "milestone in a lot of ways". The device also allows the novelist to insert self-critique; The Sunday Times reviewer notes that Imperial Bedrooms finds its characters [...] "still a little sore at their depiction as inarticulate zombies". John Crace, in his [...] "digested read" [...] of Imperial Bedrooms, insinuates through parody that [...] "the author" [...] of the metafictional Less Than Zero is also meant to be Ellis, describing him in Clay's voice as [...] "too immersed in the passivity of writing and too pleased with his own style to bother with many commas to admit it so he wrote <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> story as the man who was too frightened to love." [...] With regard to the opening narrative conceit, Ellis queries [...] "Is it complication ... or is it clarification?", opining that it certainly is the latter for Clay. Even though Ellis never names himself explicitly in the book, he conceded to Lawson that one can [...] "guess [...] is who the Clay of Imperial Bedrooms is referring to." [...] Ellis did, however, reveal that he had not decided when writing the novel whether Clay was referring to him or not. Eileen Battersby likened Bedrooms to Lunar Park (2005), cited his use of [...] "self-consciousness as a device." [...] This device was picked up on by several other critics—in particular, Vice noted that [...] "the scatological violence of American Psycho" [...] and [...] "the otherworldly terror of Lunar Park" [...] had here been combined. Ellis himself raised the [...] "sequel" [...] question, commenting [...] "...I don't think it is [...] Well, I mean, it is and it isn't. It's narrated by him, sure. But I guess I could maybe have switched the names around and it could stand alone." ...|$|E
