An efficient <b>medium</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> algorithm allows nodes to share the wireless medium at a lower energy cost and achieve a higher throughput.

To improve the performance of CSMA/CD under heavy load, a new concept called network partitioning is presented. Network partitioning allows the network to be partitioned into segments when under heavy load. Partition stations then act as bridges between the segments.
