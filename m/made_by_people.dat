From {{this point of view}} every person is sinful because every person makes mistakes during his life. When person accuses others in sins he always must remember that he is also sinner and so he must have mercy for others remembering that God is also merciful to him and to all humanity.|$|E

Local art societies became prominent in the 1940s, particularly The Art Students Club, which opened in 1940.|$|E

25|$|There are 20 known {{contemporary}} {{accounts of}} the First Fleet <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> sailing in the Fleet, including journals (both manuscript and published) and letters. The eleven ships of the Fleet, carrying over 1,000 convicts, soldiers and seamen, left England on 13 May 1787 and arrived in Botany Bay between 18 and 20 January 1788 before relocating to Port Jackson to establish the first European settlement in Australia, a penal colony which became Sydney. At least 12 people on the Fleet kept a journal of their experiences, {{some of which were}} later published, while others wrote letters home during the voyage or soon after their arrival in Australia. These personal {{accounts of the}} voyage were <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> including surgeons, officers, soldiers, ordinary seamen, and Captain Arthur Phillip, who commanded the expedition. Only one known account, that of James Martin, was by a transported convict. Their journals document the day to day experiences of those in the Fleet, and record significant events including the first contact between the European settlers and the Aboriginal people of the area. In 2009, the manuscript journals were included in The Australian Memory of the World Register, a regional register associated with the UNESCO international Memory of the World programme.|$|E
25|$|Discrete choice models {{theoretically}} or empirically model choices <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> among {{a finite}} set of alternatives. The {{models have been}} used to examine, e.g., the choice of which car to buy, where to go to college, which mode of transport (car, bus, rail) to take to work among numerous other applications. Discrete choice models are also used to examine choices by organizations, such as firms or government agencies. In the discussion below, the decision-making unit is assumed to be a person, though the concepts are applicable more generally. Daniel McFadden won the Nobel prize in 2000 for his pioneering work in developing the theoretical basis for discrete choice.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{precedent}} set in 133, several attempts were <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> generally {{associated with the}} populares party {{to protect the public}} rights of provocatio against executive power.

The lex Sempronia can be seen as a direct reaction to the fate of Tiberius Gracchus and his followers, who were tried and sentenced in a special tribunal with powers of capital punishment.|$|E

The Court ruled that seamen's contracts had been considered unique from time immemorial, and that [...] "the amendment {{was not intended to}} introduce any novel doctrine with respect to certain descriptions of service which have always been treated as exceptional."

500|$|From Edward's death, Alexandra was queen mother, being a dowager {{queen and}} the mother of the reigning monarch. She did not attend her son's {{coronation}} in 1911 since it was not customary for a crowned queen to attend the coronation of another king or queen, but otherwise continued the public side of her life, devoting time to her charitable causes. One such cause included Alexandra Rose Day, where artificial roses <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> with disabilities were sold in aid of hospitals by women volunteers. During the First World War, the custom of hanging the banners of foreign princes invested with Britain's highest order of knighthood, the Order of the Garter, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, came under criticism, as the German members of the Order were fighting against Britain. Alexandra joined calls to [...] "have down those hateful German banners". Driven by public opinion, but against his own wishes, the king had the banners removed but to Alexandra's dismay he had down not only [...] "those vile Prussian banners" [...] but also those of her Hessian relations who were, in her opinion, [...] "simply soldiers or vassals under that brutal German Emperor's orders". On 17 September 1916, she was at Sandringham during a Zeppelin air raid, but far worse was to befall other members of her family. In Russia, her nephew Tsar Nicholas II was overthrown and he, his wife and children were killed by revolutionaries. Her sister the Dowager Empress was rescued from Russia in 1919 by [...] and brought to England, where she lived for some time with Alexandra.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the critics}} and film historians who have {{reviewed}} The Quatermass Xperiment {{in the years}} since it release have been John Baxter who said, in Science Fiction in the Cinema (1970), [...] "In its time, The Quatermass Experiment was a pioneering sf film... Brian Donlevy was stiff but convincing... Much of the film is saved, however, by Richard Wordsworth... one of the finest such performances since Karloff's triumphs of the Thirties.” This view was echoed by John Brosnan in The Primal Screen (1991): [...] "One of the best of all alien possession movies", he wrote, [...] "Not since Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's monster has an actor managed to create such a memorable, and sympathetic, monster out of mime alone". Bill Warren in Keep Watching The Skies! (1982) found that [...] "the buildup is slightly too long and too careful" [...] but also said, [...] "It's an intelligent, taut and well-directed thriller; it showcases Nigel Kneale's ideas well; it's scary and exciting. It was <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> who cared about what they were doing, who were making entertainment for adults. It {{is still one of the}} best alien invasion films". Steve Chibnall, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, describes The Quatermass Xperiment as [...] "one of the high points of British SF/horror cinema." [...] The horror fiction writer Stephen King praised the film as one of his favourite horror movies from between 1950 and 1980 in his non-fiction book Danse Macabre (1991). The film director John Carpenter, who later collaborated with Nigel Kneale on the film [...] (1982), has claimed that The Quatermass Xperiment [...] "had an enormous, enormous impact on me – and it continues to be one of my all-time favourite science-fiction movies." ...|$|E
