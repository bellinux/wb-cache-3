Sometimes software or a custom address decoder was required for this to work. This moved the barrier to 704 KB (with MDA/HGC) or 736 KB (with CGA).|$|E
25|$|The Virtual Boy was panned {{by critics}} {{and was a}} {{commercial}} failure. Its failure has been cited as due to its high price, <b>monochrome</b> <b>display,</b> unimpressive 3D effect, lack of true portability, health concerns, and low quality games. Its negative reception was unaffected by continued price drops. 3D technology in video game consoles reemerged in later years to more success, including in Nintendo's own 3DS handheld console. The Virtual Boy is Nintendo's second lowest-selling platform after the 64DD.|$|E
25|$|The word {{processor}} was a stand-alone office {{machine in the}} 1960s, combining the keyboard text-entry and printing functions of an electric typewriter with a recording unit, either tape or floppy disk (as used by the Wang machine) with a simple dedicated computer processor for the editing of text. Although features and designs varied among manufacturers and models, and new features were added as technology advanced, {{word processor}}s typically featured a <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> {{and the ability to}} save documents on memory cards or diskettes. Later models introduced innovations such as spell-checking programs, and improved formatting options.|$|E

25|$|In 1986 Amstrad {{entered the}} IBM PC-compatible arena with the PC1512 system. In {{standard}} Amstrad livery and priced at £399 {{it was a}} success, capturing more than 25% of the European computer market. It was MS-DOS-based, but with the GEM graphics interface, and later Windows. In 1988 Amstrad attempted {{to make the first}} affordable portable personal computer with the PPC512 and 640 models, introduced a year before the Macintosh Portable. They ran MS-DOS on an 8MHz processor, and the built-in screen could emulate the <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> Adapter or Color Graphics Adapter. Amstrad's final (and ill-fated) attempts to exploit the Sinclair brand were based on the company's own PCs; a compact desktop PC derived from the PPC 512, branded as the Sinclair PC200, and the PC1512 rebadged as the Sinclair PC500.|$|E
25|$|Compared to the Lexus RX 330 and RX 350, the RX 400h {{featured}} a different front grille and round fog lights, and also differently styled LED taillights {{in place of}} the conventional LED ones on the RX 330/RX 350. Different exterior colors were offered. In 2007, Hybrid badging was added to the rear side doors. The RX 400h interior {{featured a}} hybrid information display on the navigation screen showing electrical motor, gasoline engine, and regenerative braking activation in real time. Some RX 400h models without navigation screens displayed the information on a small <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> on the instrument panel. When launched in 2005, the RX 400h came exclusively with brushed aluminum interior accents, {{in place of the}} wood trim offered in the standard RX. This changed in 2006, when the RX 400h became available with Bird's Eye Maple wood trim.|$|E
25|$|Smith's first Macintosh {{board was}} built to Raskin's design specifications: it had 64kilobytes (kB) of RAM, used the 8-bit Motorola 6809E microprocessor, and was capable of {{supporting}} a 256×256-pixel black-and-white bitmap display. Bud Tribble, {{a member of the}} Mac team, was interested in running the Apple Lisa's graphical programs on the Macintosh, and asked Smith whether he could incorporate the Lisa's Motorola 68000 microprocessor into the Mac while still keeping the production cost down. By December 1980, Smith had succeeded in designing a board that not only used the 68000, but increased its speed from the Lisa's 5MHz to 8MHz; this board also had the capacity to support a 384×256-pixel display. Smith's design used fewer RAM chips than the Lisa, which made production of the board significantly more cost-efficient. The final Mac design was self-contained and had the complete QuickDraw picture language and interpreter in 64KB of ROM– far more than most other computers which typically had around 4 to 8KB of ROM; it had 128kB of RAM, in the form of sixteen 64-kilobit (kb) RAM chips soldered to the logicboard. Though there were no memory slots, its RAM was expandable to 512kB by means of soldering sixteen IC sockets to accept 256kb RAM chips in place of the factory-installed chips. The final product's screen was a , 512x342 pixel <b>monochrome</b> <b>display,</b> exceeding the size of the planned screen.|$|E

2500|$|The Virtual Boy is a 32-bit {{table-top}} {{video game}} console developed and manufactured by Nintendo. Released in 1995, it was marketed {{as the first}} console capable of displaying stereoscopic 3D graphics. The player uses the console {{in a manner similar}} to a head-mounted display, placing their head against the eyepiece to see a red <b>monochrome</b> <b>display.</b> The games use a parallax effect to create the illusion of depth. Sales failed to meet targets, and by early 1996, Nintendo ceased distribution and game development, only ever releasing 22 games for the system.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 October 2001, Apple Computer {{unveiled}} {{the first generation}} iPod, a 5GB hard drive based DAP with a 1.8" [...] Toshiba hard drive and a 2" [...] <b>monochrome</b> <b>display.</b> With {{the development of a}} spartan user interface and a smaller form factor, the iPod was initially popular within the Macintosh community. In July 2002, Apple introduced the second generation update to the iPod. It was compatible with Windows computers through Musicmatch Jukebox. In 2007, Apple introduced the iPod Touch, the first iPod with a multi-touch screen. Its media player was split into the Music and Videos apps.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the first}} IBM PC was {{designed}} in 1980, it included a [...] "peseta symbol" [...] "Pts" [...] in the ROM of the <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> Adapter (MDA) and Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) video output cards' hardware, with the code number 158. This original character set chart {{later became the}} MS-DOS code page 437. [...] Some spreadsheet software for PC under MS-DOS, as Lotus 1-2-3, employed this character as the peseta symbol in their Spanish editions. [...] Subsequent international MS-DOS code pages, like code page 850 and others, deprecated this character in favour of some other national characters.|$|E

2500|$|The Virtual Boy is {{the first}} video game console that was {{supposed}} to be capable of displaying stereoscopic 3D graphics, marketed as a form of virtual reality. Whereas most video games use monocular cues to achieve the illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen, the Virtual Boy creates an illusion of depth through the effect known as parallax. In a manner similar to using a head-mounted display, the user looks into an eyepiece made of neoprene on the front of the machine, and then an eyeglass-style projector allows viewing of the monochromatic (in this case, red) image. Nintendo claimed that a color display would have made the system too expensive and resulted in [...] "jumpy" [...] images, so the company opted for a <b>monochrome</b> <b>display.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Instead, {{a number}} of hybrid {{solutions}} were developed that combined a conventional <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> with a colored disk or mirror. In these systems the three colored images were sent one after each other, in either complete frames in the [...] "field-sequential color system", or for each line in the [...] "line-sequential" [...] system. In both cases a colored filter was rotated {{in front of the}} display in sync with the broadcast. Since three separate images were being sent in sequence, if they used existing monochrome radio signaling standards they would have an effective refresh rate of only 20 fields, or 10 frames, a second, well into the region where flicker would become visible. In order to avoid this, these systems increased the frame rate considerably, making the signal incompatible with existing monochrome standards.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} BlackBerry device had a <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> while newer models installed color displays. All newer {{models have}} been optimized for [...] "thumbing", the use of only the thumbs to type on a keyboard. The Storm 1 and Storm 2 include a SureType keypad for typing. Originally, system navigation was achieved {{with the use of}} a scroll wheel mounted on the right side of device models prior to the 8700. The trackwheel was replaced by the trackball with the introduction of the Pearl series, which allowed four-way scrolling. The trackball was replaced by the optical trackpad with the introduction of the Curve 8500 series. Models made to use iDEN networks, such as Nextel, SouthernLINC, NII Holdings, and Mike also incorporate a push-to-talk (PTT) feature, similar to a two-way radio.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of luma/chroma {{systems such as}} Y′UV, and its relatives Y′IQ and YDbDr, is that they remain compatible with black and white analog television (largely due {{to the work of}} Georges Valensi). The Y′ channel saves all the data recorded by black and white cameras, so it produces a signal suitable for reception on old <b>monochrome</b> <b>displays.</b> In this case, the U and V are simply discarded. If displaying color, all three channels are used, and the original RGB information can be decoded.|$|R
2500|$|While Nintendo {{had promised}} a virtual reality experience, the <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> limits the Virtual Boy's {{potential}} for immersion. Reviewers often considered the 3-dimensional features a gimmick, added to games that were essentially 2- or even 1-dimensional. The Washington Post felt that, {{even when a}} game gives the impression of 3-dimensionality, it suffers from [...] "hollow vector graphics." [...] Yokoi, the system's inventor, said the system did best with action and puzzle games, although those types of games provided only minimal immersion. Multiple critics lamented the absence of head-tracking in the Virtual Boy hardware. Critics found that, as a result, players were unable to immerse themselves in the game worlds of Virtual Boy games. Instead, they interacted with the fictional worlds {{in the manner of}} any traditional 2-dimensional game (that is, via a controller). Boyer said the console [...] "struggles to merge the two distinct media forms of home consoles and virtual reality devices." [...] While the device employed virtual reality techniques, it did so via the traditional home console. No feedback from the body was incorporated into gameplay.|$|E
2500|$|Following its release, {{reviews of}} the Virtual Boy tended to praise its novelty, but {{questioned}} its ultimate purpose and longtime viability. The Los Angeles Times described gameplay as being [...] "at once familiar and strange." [...] The column praised the quality of motion and immersive graphics, but considered the hardware itself tedious to use and non-portable. A later column by the same reviewer found the system to be somewhat asocial, although it held out hope for the console's future. Reviewing the system shortly after its North American launch, Next Generation said, [...] "Unusual and innovative, the Virtual Boy {{can be seen as}} a gamble in the same way that the Game Boy was, but it's a lot harder to see the VB succeeding to the same world-conquering extent that the Game Boy did." [...] They elaborated that while the sharp display and unique 3D effect are impressive, aspects such as the <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> and potential vision damage to young gamers severely limit the system's appeal. They added that the software library was decent, but failed to capitalize on Nintendo's best-selling franchises (Zelda and Metroid games were absent, and the Mario games were not in the same style as the series's most successful installments) and lacked a system seller to compare with the Game Boy's Tetris.|$|E
