40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report on}} the design, {{analytical}} modeling, numerical simulation, fabrication, and experimental characterization of chip-scale <b>microwave</b> <b>resonators</b> that exhibit high quality-factors (Q-factors) in the microwave frequency range. We demonstrate high Q-factors by tuning these <b>microwave</b> <b>resonators</b> with the film capacitance of their LC tank circuits rather than the conventional approach of using external capaci-tors for tuning. Our chip-scale resonator design further minimizes en-ergy losses and reduces the effect of skin depth leading to high Q-fac-tors even for significantly reduced device areas. Using our new design methodology, we observe that despite the higher resonance frequency and smaller chip size, the Q-factor is improved compared with the pre-vious literature using traditional approaches. For our 540 m 540 m resonator chip, we theoretically compute a Q-factor of 52. 40 at the calculated resonance frequency of 6. 70 GHz and experimentally demon-strate a Q-factor of 47. 10 at the measured resonance frequency of 6. 97 GHz. We thus achieve optimal design for <b>microwave</b> <b>resonators</b> with the highest Q-factor in the smallest space for operation at 6. 97 GHz. © 200...|$|R

40|$|We propose {{and analyze}} a circuit that {{implements}} a nonlinear coupling between two superconducting <b>microwave</b> <b>resonators.</b> The resonators are coupled through a {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID) that terminates {{one of the}} resonators. This produces a nonlinear interaction on the standard optomechanical form, where the quadrature of one resonator couples to the photon number of the other resonator. The circuit therefore allows for all-electrical realizations of analogs to optomechanical systems, with coupling that can be both strong and tunable. We estimate the coupling strengths that should be attainable with the proposed device, and we find that the device is a promising candidate for realizing the single-photon strong-coupling regime.

40|$|Cat-state qubits (qubits encoded with cat states) have {{recently}} drawn intensive attention {{due to their}} enhanced life times with quantum error correction. We here propose a method to implement a universal controlled-phase gate of two cat-state qubits, via two <b>microwave</b> <b>resonators</b> coupled to a superconducting transmon qutrit. During the gate operation, the qutrit remains in the ground state; thus decoherence from the qutrit is greatly suppressed. This proposal requires only two basic operations and neither classical pulse nor measurement is needed; therefore the gate realization is simple. Numerical simulations show that high-fidelity implementation of this gate is feasible with current circuit QED technology. The proposal is quite general and {{can be applied to}} implement the proposed gate with two <b>microwave</b> <b>resonators</b> or two optical cavities coupled to a single three-level natural or artificial atom.

50|$|Photons {{incident}} {{on a strip}} of superconducting material break Cooper pairs and create excess quasiparticles. The kinetic inductance of the superconducting strip is inversely proportional to the density of Cooper pairs, and thus the kinetic inductance increases upon photon absorption. This inductance is combined with a capacitor to form a <b>microwave</b> <b>resonator</b> whose resonant frequency changes with the absorption of photons. This resonator-based readout is useful for developing large-format detector arrays, as each KID can be addressed by a single microwave tone and many detectors can be measured using a single broadband microwave channel, a technique known as frequency-division multiplexing.|$|E

5000|$|Coupling {{between two}} or more qubits is {{essential}} to implement many-qubit gates. The two basic coupling mechanisms are the direct inductive coupling and coupling via a <b>microwave</b> <b>resonator.</b> In the direct coupling, the circulating currents of the qubits inductively affect one another - clockwise current in one qubit induces counter-clockwise current in the other. In the Pauli Matrices formalism, a [...] term appears in the Hamiltonian, essential for the controlled NOT gate implementation. The direct coupling might be further enhanced by kinetic inductance, if the qubit loops are made to share an edge, so that the currents will flow through the same superconducting line. Inserting a Josephson junction on that joint line will add a Josephson inductance term, and increase the coupling even more. To implement a switchable coupling in the direct coupling mechanism, as required to implement a gate of finite duration, an intermediate coupling loop may be used. The control magnetic flux applied to the coupler loop switches the coupling on and off, as implemented, for example, in the D-Wave Systems machines. The second method of coupling utilizes an intermediate microwave cavity resonator, commonly implemented in a coplanar waveguide geometry. By tuning the energy separation of the qubits to match {{the one of the}} resonator, the phases of the loop currents are synchronized, and a [...] coupling is implemented. Tuning the qubits in and out of resonance (for example, by modifying their bias magnetic flux) controls the duration of the gate operation.|$|E
