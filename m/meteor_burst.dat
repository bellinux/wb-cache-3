No damage was reported. The astronomical observatory in nearby Neuquén later revealed that the cause had been a <b>meteor</b> that <b>burst</b> in the atmosphere over the city, at an estimated speed of 2400 kph mph. Astronomer Roberto Figueroa estimated that the meteor measured approximately 12 m across and probably broke on atmospheric entry, falling mostly as ash, but some larger fragments could have reached the lower atmosphere and caused an audible boom.|$|R

Thus, although the advice to duck and cover is over half a century old, ballistic glass lacerations caused {{the majority of the}} 1000 human injuries following the Chelyabinsk <b>meteor</b> air <b>burst</b> of February 15, 2013. The dangers of viewing explosions behind window glass was known of before the Atomic Age began, being a common source of injury and death from large chemical explosions. In the accidental Halifax Explosion of 1917, an ammunition ship exploding with the force of roughly 2.9 kilotons of TNT, and injured the eyes and faces of hundreds of people who looked out of their windows after seeing a bright flash. Every window in the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia, was shattered.|$|R
50|$|The blast {{created by}} the <b>meteor's</b> air <b>burst</b> {{produced}} extensive ground damage over an irregular elliptical area a few tens of kilometres across, with the secondary effects of the blast being {{the main cause of}} the considerable number of injuries. Russian authorities stated that 1,491 people sought medical attention in Chelyabinsk Oblast within the first few days. Health officials said 112 people had been hospitalised, with two in serious condition. A 52-year-old woman with a broken spine was flown to Moscow for treatment. Most of the injured were hurt by the secondary blast effects of shattered, falling or blown-in glass. The intense light from the meteor, momentarily 30 times brighter than the Sun, also produced injuries, leading to over 180 cases of eye pain, and 70 people subsequently reported temporary flash blindness. Twenty people reported ultraviolet burns similar to sunburn, possibly intensified by the presence of snow on the ground. Vladimir Petrov, when meeting with scientists to assess the damage, reported that he sustained so much sunburn from the meteor that the skin flaked only days later.|$|R

50|$|<b>Meteor</b> <b>burst</b> {{communications}} {{faded from}} interest {{with the increasing}} use of satellite communications systems starting in the late 1960s.

For these reasons, the U.S. Air Force installed the Alaska Air Command MBC system in the 1970s, although it is not publicly known whether this system is still operational.|$|E
5000|$|A {{more recent}} {{study is the}} Advanced <b>Meteor</b> <b>Burst</b> Communications System (AMBCS), a testbed set up by SAIC under DARPA funding. Using phase-steerable antennas {{directed}} at the proper area of the sky for any given time of day, the direction where the Earth is moving [...] "forward", AMBCS was able to greatly improve the data rates, averaging 4 kilobits per second (kbit/s). While satellites may have a nominal throughput about 14 times greater, they're vastly more expensive to operate.|$|E
5000|$|Fireballs {{reaching}} {{apparent magnitude}} &minus;14 or brighter are called bolides. The IAU has no official definition of [...] "bolide", and generally considers the term synonymous with [...] "fireball". Astronomers often use [...] "bolide" [...] to identify an exceptionally bright fireball, particularly one that explodes. They are sometimes called detonating fireballs (also see List of <b>meteor</b> air <b>bursts).</b> It {{may also be}} used to mean a fireball which creates audible sounds. In the late twentieth century, bolide has also come to mean any object that hits Earth and explodes, with no regard to its composition (asteroid or comet). The word bolide comes from the Greek βολίς (bolis) [...] which can mean a missile or to flash. If the magnitude of a bolide reaches &minus;17 or brighter it is known as a superbolide. A relatively small percentage of fireballs hit Earth's atmosphere and then pass out again: these are termed Earth-grazing fireballs. Such an event happened in broad daylight over North America in 1972. Another rare phenomena is a meteor procession, where the meteor breaks up into several fireballs traveling nearly parallel to the surface of Earth.|$|R
6000|$|The last {{trace of}} his {{previous}} state of mind vanished, as the instantaneous and elusive trail of a <b>bursting</b> <b>meteor</b> vanishes on the profound blackness of the sky; it was the faint flicker of a painful thought, gone as soon as perceived, that nothing but her presence--after all--had the power to recall him to himself. He stared at her. She sat with {{her hands on her}} lap, looking down; and he noticed that her boots were dirty, her skirts wet and splashed, as though she had been driven back there by a blind fear through a waste of mud. He was indignant, amazed and shocked, but in a natural, healthy way now; so that he could control those unprofitable sentiments by the dictates of cautious self-restraint. The light in the room had no unusual brilliance now; it was a good light in which he could easily observe the expression of her face. It was that of dull fatigue. And the silence that surrounded them was the normal silence of any quiet house, hardly disturbed by the faint noises of a respectable quarter of the town. He was very cool--and it was quite coolly that he thought how much better it would be if neither of them ever spoke again. She sat with closed lips, with an air of lassitude in the stony forgetfulness of her pose, but after a moment she lifted her drooping eyelids and met his tense and inquisitive stare by a look that had all the formless eloquence of a cry. It penetrated, it stirred without informing; it was the very essence of anguish stripped of words that can be smiled at, argued away, shouted down, disdained. It was anguish naked and unashamed, the bare pain of existence let loose upon the world in the fleeting unreserve of a look that had in it an immensity of fatigue, the scornful sincerity, the black impudence of an extorted confession. Alvan Hervey was seized with wonder, as though he had seen something inconceivable; and some obscure part of his being was ready to exclaim with him: [...] "I would never have believed it!" [...] but an instantaneous revulsion of wounded susceptibilities checked the unfinished thought.|$|R

50|$|There is a {{wide range}} of {{specialized}} sampling equipment available that can be programmed to take samples at fixed or variable time intervals or in response to an external trigger.

The trigger in this case may be a remote rain gauge communicating with the sampler by using cell phone or <b>meteor</b> <b>burst</b> technology. Samplers can also take individual discrete samples at each sampling occasion or bulk up samples into composite so that in the course of one day, such a sampler might produce 12 composite samples each composed of 6 sub-samples taken at 20 minute intervals.|$|E
50|$|Although on-site data {{collection}} using electronic measuring equipment is common-place, many monitoring programmes also use remote surveillance and remote {{access to data}} in real time. This requires the on-site monitoring equipment {{to be connected to}} a base station via either a telemetry network, land-line, cell phone network or other telemetry system such as <b>Meteor</b> <b>burst.</b> The advantage of remote surveillance is that many data feeds can come into a single base station for storing and analysis. It also enable trigger levels or alert levels to be set for individual monitoring sites and/or parameters so that immediate action can be initiated if a trigger level is exceeded. The use of remote surveillance also allows for the installation of very discrete monitoring equipment which can often be buried, camouflaged or tethered at depth in a lake or river with only a short whip aerial protruding. Use of such equipment tends to reduce vandalism and theft when monitoring in locations easily accessible by the public.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} agency {{that was the}} strongest advocate for relocatable vans was the Defense Communications Agency (DCA), since renamed the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), whose responsibility it was to plan for continuity of military communications despite the possible loss of both land and satellite-based links. This necessitated the development of alternatives that would be independent of both land lines and land-based radio systems, and also satellites, {{all of which were}} thought to be possibly subject to destruction or impairment in an all-out war. The alternatives needed to be capable of being relocated, perhaps frequently, and set up rapidly in a new location when necessary. Since the facts of nuclear warfare also seemed to indicate that High Frequency (HF) Radio propagation might be disturbed by unfamiliar nuclear effects, this led to the consideration of exotic technologies such as troposcatter and <b>meteor</b> <b>burst</b> communication links. Such systems, while effective, used relatively small antennas and could indeed be transported efficiently and economically in relocatable vans.|$|E
50|$|Small, sand-grain sized meteoroids are {{entering}} the atmosphere constantly, essentially every few seconds in any given region of the atmosphere, and thus ionization trails {{can be found in}} the upper atmosphere more or less continuously. When radio waves are bounced off these trails, it is called <b>meteor</b> <b>burst</b> communications. Meteor radars can measure atmospheric density and winds by measuring the decay rate and Doppler shift of a meteor trail. Most meteoroids burn up when they enter the atmosphere. The left-over debris is called meteoric dust or just meteor dust. Meteor dust particles can persist in the atmosphere for up to several months. These particles might affect climate, both by scattering electromagnetic radiation and by catalyzing chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere. Meteoroids or their fragments may achieve dark flight after deceleration to terminal velocity. Dark flight starts when they decelerate to about 2 - 4 km/s mph. Larger fragments will fall further down the strewn field.|$|E

Analyzing the characteristics of underdense <b>meteor</b> <b>burst</b> channel, the multi-layer node models of master station and slave station are presented to create practical simulation scenario of <b>meteor</b> <b>burst</b> communications. The simulation processes of half-duplex communication as well as full-duplex communication are designed to execute simulation.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMeteor burst communication {{is currently being}} researched as a survivable, backup means to long-range communications due to a preceived vulnerability to HF and satellite communications. A specific hypothetical link that is analyzed in this thesis {{is that of a}} <b>meteor</b> <b>burst</b> relay network. The network consists of fixed land facilities, permanently moored ocean buoys, and air-deployable buoys, all in support of deployed submarines. The advantage of such a system for the submarine fleet is that it would allow the ability of establishing communications while maintaining a covert posture on-station. This is due to the <b>meteor</b> <b>burst</b> phenomenon of scattering, where a meteor trail projects a small ground illumination footprint, as compared to HF communications.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / May 18 - 20, 1965 / Sheraton Park Hotel, Washington DCThe <b>meteor</b> <b>burst</b> {{telemetry}} {{system to}} be described was conceived, designed, and developed as an Engineering Model.

40|$|To be {{accepted}} as a viable competitor for long distance communication, {{it remains to be}} demonstrated that <b>meteor</b> <b>burst</b> systems possess the potential to support reasonable throughput at agreeable costs. Using measurements from an existing <b>meteor</b> <b>burst</b> link between London and Ottawa, estimates of the path loss, flight-time, waiting time and burst duration were obtained. These results demonstrated that by employing modest equipment, communication could be maintained with an average waiting time of 3. 5 minutes and an average transmission time or burst duration 0. 5 seconds. By using these parameters and assuming a transmission rate of 4800 bps, the average throughput for this link was estimated to be 11. 4 bps. While this throughput may be adequate for applications having low data volumes such as remote monitoring and vehicle tracking, improvements are achievable through increases in transmitter power, antenna gains and data transmission rate. To date, however, little research has been undertaken to assess the effect of potential bandwidth limitations (if any) which may restrict the signaling rate that can be supported by the link. An investigation of these impairments was carried out using an instrument that was specifically designed to probe the multipath nature of the <b>meteor</b> <b>burst</b> channel. These measurements revealed that in the majority of instances only a single path exists between the transmitter and receiver and consequently, serious impairments arising from multipath interference appear to be relatively infrequent. In some rare instances, however, as many as four such paths have been observed. Delay spread measurements were found to confirm the presence of multipath interference for which the statistics reveal that in 90 % of all observations the delay spread is below 100 ns. Based on these statistics and observations to date, it is likely that data rates ranging from several hundred kbps to perhaps 1 Mbps can be supported by the <b>meteor</b> <b>burst</b> channel...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} 37 -MHz signals {{received}} over an 800 -km temperate latitude path using 400 -W continuous wave transmissions. Signals collected during a 9 -day period in February 1990 on two antennas at separations of 5 λ, 10 λ, and 20 λ were analyzed. Three signal categories were identified (overdense, underdense, and not known (NK)) and cross-correlation coefficients between the signals {{received by the}} two antennas were calculated for each signal category. No spatial variation, and in particular no decrease, in average cross-correlation coefficient was observed for underdense or NK signals as the antenna spacing was increased from 5 λ to 20 λ. At each antenna separation the cross-correlation coefficients of these two categories were strongly dependent on time. Overdense signals, however, showed no cross-correlation time dependency at 5 λ and 10 λ, {{but there was a}} strong time dependency at 20 λ. Recommendations are made in regard to the optimum antenna spacing for a <b>meteor</b> <b>burst</b> communication system using spaced antenna diversity.
