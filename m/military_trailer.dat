40|$|In {{military}} transportation, {{the use of}} wide trailer for transporting {{the large}} and heavy weight equipments such as tank, armoured vehicle, and mobile gunnery is quite common. So, the vulnerability of causing traffic accidents for these wide <b>military</b> <b>trailer</b> to bump or collide with another car in adjacent lane is very high due to its broad width in excess of its own lane's width. Also, the possibility of these strayed accidents can be increased especially by the careless driver. In this paper, the recognition system of lane and vehicle headway direction is developed to detect the possible collision and warn the driver to prevent the fatal accident. In the system development, Kalman filtering is used first to extract the border of driving lane from the video images supplied by the CCD camera attached to the vehicle and the driving lane detection is completed with regression analysis. Next, the vehicle headway direction is recognized by using neural network scheme with the extracted parameters of the detected driving lane feature. The practical experiments for the developed system are also {{carried out in the}} real traffic road of Seoul city area and the results show us the more than 90 % accuracy in recognizing the driving lane and vehicle headway direction...|$|E

50|$|Many of {{the later}} models never saw action and were {{disposed}} of {{at the end of}} the war, mostly exported to the USA where they were sold by a New York department store. The lack of a front brake meant that they could not legally be used on the road, however, so most were bought by farmers for off road use. The originator John Dolphin developed his ideas further and set up the Corgi Motorcycle Co Ltd. of which he was Managing Director, and had them produced as the Corgi by Brockhouse Engineering (Southport) Ltd., who had been manufacturing <b>military</b> <b>trailers</b> during the war. The Corgi scooter was powered by an Excelsior Spryt Autocycle engine and went into production in 1947. Most were initially exported to North America branded as the 'Indian Papoose' and not sold in the UK until early 1948, with some 27,050 being manufactured. The single-speed two-stroke engine was too slow, however, and even despite the high post war demand for transport, lack of power and reliability problems meant it was discontinued in October 1954.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] U-1 was a 1950s liquid {{hydrogen}} trailer designed to carry cryogenic {{liquid hydrogen}} (LH2) on roads being pulled by a powered vehicle. It was designed {{in response to}} requirements of the secret US government program code-named Suntan, which aimed to develop a high speed, high altitude hydrogen-powered <b>military</b> aircraft. The <b>trailer</b> was constructed by the Cambridge Corporation and had a capacity of 26,500 liters with a hydrogen loss rate of approximately 2 percent per day. The U-1 was a single axle semi-trailer. The specifications for its successor the U-2 a double axle semi-trailer were issued on 15 March 1957.|$|R

[...] Other veterans' housing projects used <b>military</b> barracks and <b>trailers,</b> as did a settlement in Burbank which provided travel trailers to house some of the Japanese and Japanese Americans who had been taken from their Southern California homes and sent to internment camps in other parts of the country.|$|R
