40|$|Abstract. To {{improve the}} {{resolution}} {{and reduce the}} noise in image, a framework of Multi-image super resolution reconstruction with Pepper and Salt noise is pro-posed. In the low resolution imaging model, the processes of <b>movement,</b> <b>blur,</b> down-sampling and Pepper and Salt noise are considered. Firstly, for the multiple low resolution images, the Pepper and Salt noise in each image is reduced through median filtering method. Then, super resolution reconstruction is carried out on the multiple de-noised low resolution images through iterative back projection al-gorithm. Experiments show that the visual effect and the peak {{signal to noise ratio}} (PSNR) of the super resolution reconstructed image is improved greatly...|$|E
40|$|The {{motion of}} C-arm {{scanning}} X-ray systems {{may result in}} vibrations of the imaging sub-system. In this paper, we connect C-arm system vibrations to Image Quality (IQ) deterioration for 2 D angiography and 3 D cone beam X-ray imaging, using large Flat Panel detectors. Vibrations will affect the projected image sharpness and the projected image position. The former will appear as blur and the latter as image shift for the 2 D projection radiography process. If this phenomenon is not corrected in the post processing (pixel shift), it will manifest as subtraction registration artifacts. We will model and verify the effect of vibrations in 2 D subtracted and non-subtracted flat panel imaging. Two effects on 3 D IQ are modeled: (1) vibrations during an actual acquisition run inducing <b>movement</b> <b>blur</b> and (2) C-arm movement calibration errors in the iso-center giving remnant blur. The model establishes a relation between vibration amplitudes and image quality for dominant system Eigen-frequencies. The validity and accuracy of the model for 2 D and 3 D imaging modes is supported and demonstrated by experiments and even provides sufficient quality for defining image quality requirements...|$|E
40|$|The {{underwater}} videomicroskop {{represents an}} optical measuring concept for visualization and characterization of suspended matter in rivers, lakes and seas. An {{image of the}} measuring volume, which spreads 0, 9 x 1, 2 mm, is formed by a CCD camera which is equipped with macro lenses. The image contains 512 x 512 picture elements each 2, 38 x 1, 79 #mu#m with a resolution of 256 grey levels. A Xenon Flash with a puls duration of 2 #mu#s and a frequency of 25 - 100 allows the freezing of particles with a relative velocity of up to 50 cm/s without <b>movement</b> <b>blur</b> and the determination of its relative velocity. The images may be examined visually on the monitor, stored on video tape and analyzed online by digital image analysis. The analysis may be performed offline for variation of test parameters. For {{the interpretation of the}} image an interactive or automated analysis software has been designed. The characteristic parameters are diameter of circle of same area, axis ratio of approximating ellipse and several form describing parameters (fourier coefficients, tangent angles, ratio perimeter/area). By means of the form parameters effects of a non spherical particles form may be quantified (i. e. measuring error, dynamic behavior, chemical properties). The application of these measuring technique are amongst others suspended matter transport, material characterization, water quality management and limnology. (orig.)

40|$|Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is {{measured}} above the head, {{which makes it}} sensitive to variations of the head position {{with respect to the}} sensors. Head <b>movements</b> <b>blur</b> the topography of the neuronal sources of the MEG signal, increase localization errors, and reduce statistical sensitivity. Here we describe two novel and readily applicable methods that compensate for the detrimental effects of head motion on the statistical sensitivity of MEG experiments. First, we introduce an online procedure that continuously monitors head position. Second, we describe an offline analysis method that takes into account the head position time-series. We quantify the performance of these methods in the context of three different experimental settings, involving somatosensory, visual and auditory stimuli, assessing both individual and group-level statistics. The online head localization procedure allowed for optimal repositioning of the subjects over multiple sessions, resulting in a 28 % reduction of the variance in dipole position and an improvement of up to 15 % in statistical sensitivity. Offline incorporation of the head position time-series into the general linear model resulted in improvements of group-level statistical sensitivity between 15 % and 29 %. These tools can substantially reduce the influence of head movement within and between sessions, increasing the sensitivity of many cognitive neuroscience experiments...|$|R
40|$|Alexis Wright's novel The Swan Book (2013) {{illustrates}} the transnational quality of Australian literature. Through {{the interplay of}} foreign swan stories told by the European migrant Bella Donna and local country swamp stories embodied in the Aboriginal protagonist Oblivia, Wright questions the origins and nature of Australian literature. I {{will argue that the}} novel establishes a hermeneutics of relationality that crystallizes the intersubjective potentiality of our globalized world. In other words, The Swan Book suggests to its readers that Australian literature, from its production to its reception, transgresses national and spatial boundaries. I will demonstrate that the hermeneutics of relationality is realized through a mise en abyme in which non-Australian folk stories underlie Wright's depiction, Oblivia's experience and the reader's interpretation of Australia. The meaning of Australia as a place therefore emerges from an oscillation between foreign and local, as well as extradiegetic and intradiegetic perspectives. This constant hermeneutic <b>movement</b> <b>blurs</b> the boundaries between Australian and non-Australian narratives, as well as between storyteller, character and reader. More importantly, it demands that Wright's literary representation of Australia be understood in relation to the world. Ultimately, the novel shows that the significance of Australian literature resides in the creative interplay of travelling stories...|$|R

40|$|Cone-beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) is an imaging technique {{used in conjunction}} with radiation therapy. CBCT is used to verify the position of tumours just prior to radiation treatment session. The accuracy of the radiation treatment of thoracic and upper abdominal tumours is heavily affected by respiratory <b>movement.</b> <b>Blurring</b> artefacts, due to the movement during a CBCT scanning, cause misregistration between the CBCT image and the planning image. There has been growing interest in the use of motion-compensated CBCT for correcting the breathing-induced artefacts. A wide range of iterative reconstruction methods have been developed for CBCT imaging. The direct motion compensation technique has been applied to algebraic reconstruction technique (ART), simultaneous ART (SART), ordered-subset SART (OS-SART) and conjugate gradient least squares (CGLS). In this thesis a dual modality imaging of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and CBCT is proposed for the first time. This novel dual modality imaging uses the advantages of high temporal resolution of EIT imaging and high spatial resolution of the CBCT method. The main objective {{of this study is to}} combine CBCT with EIT imaging system for motion-compensated CBCT using experimental and computational phantoms. The EIT images were used for extracting motion for a motion-compensated CBCT imaging system. A simple motion extraction technique is used for extracting motion data from the low spatial resolution EIT images. This motion data is suitable for input into the direct motion-compensated CBCT. The performance of iterative algorithms for motion compensation was also studied. The dual modality CBCT-EIT is verified using experimental EIT system and computational CBCT phantom data.

5000|$|Young Girl Running on Balcony mainly {{addresses}} dynamism, {{the phenomenon}} Futurists devoted {{their lives to}} illustrating. Merriam-Webster defines it as the “theory that all phenomena (as matter or motion) can be explained as manifestations of force." [...] The Futurists believed that everything is made of dynamic forces, and that everything is in constant motion. This idea is best noted in the girl’s repeated form across the canvas, which works to represent her actual movement through space. The lines are not very definitive between each form; in fact, there aren’t many lines at all. The piece emulates an unusual sort of micro-cubist style. Balla also calls upon the techniques of both French Pointillism and Italian Divisionism. Pointillist painters utilize tiny points, which they dot on the canvas to create an image. Georges Seurat demonstrated the technique most famously in his piece, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. Conversely, the Divisionists, based {{in the north of}} Italy, used long brush strokes, more rectangular in shape than the Pointillists’ dots, and painted them next to strokes of contrasting color to create texture and depth in an image. Giovanni Segantini was famous for his pastoral representations of life in the Alps; his 1893 Afternoon in the Alps exemplifies his mastery of the Divisionist style. Balla emulates both these artists in Young Girl Running on Balcony by using tiny squares to create a mosaic effect. The many squares further break down the image of the girl herself and force the viewer to focus not on her form, but on her fragmented motion through time and space. Her <b>movement,</b> <b>blurred</b> lines between each step, is not exactly disjointed nor is it really fluid, but it is definitely continuous.|$|R
40|$|Globalisation, and {{associated}} population <b>movements,</b> <b>blurs</b> the boundaries drawn by nation-states (Castles, 2004), but {{the era of}} globalisation is a “time of continuing and even heightening nation-state building processes” (Glick-Schiller et al., 1995, 59). This thesis explores {{the ways in which}} nationality/citizenship shapes the subjectivities of ‘skilled’ people born as Filipino citizens currently living and working in Singapore. It is based on empirical investigation amongst Information Technology (IT) workers and nurses. In doing so, this thesis revisits the migration-development nexus as a site to reproduce the institutional and ideological/moral salience of the nation-state. Its salience is maintained through its capacity of ‘(re) defining’ the population moving across state borders. People crossing state borders come to embody particular national meanings, while discourses around cross-border population movement are constructed by political leaders and intellectuals as being associated with development. The employment of ‘skilled’ Filipinos in Singapore is a site where competing discourses produced in ‘development’ processes in the Philippines and Singapore intersect. ‘Skilled’ Filipino origin workers in Singapore represent ‘lost brains’ contributing to poor development outcomes in the Philippines. They are simultaneously hailed as national ‘heroes’ for their earnings shared with their family members remaining in the Philippines. Filipino citizens’ labour is re-evaluated as they are deployed to the Singapore labour market through Singapore’s immigration (citizenship) regime that determines under what conditions non-citizens can live within its jurisdiction. This regime reflects the Singapore state’s vision of nation (or what ‘development’ should look like) and symbolises the lines of inclusion/exclusion drawn in the nation-building process in Singapore. This thesis makes a comparative analysis of the viewpoints and experiences of ‘skilled’ workers in IT and nursing fields in order to explore the intersections between labour and citizenship. Using the data largely drawn from interviews, carried out between April and October 2009, in the Philippines and Singapore; this thesis explores the ways in which ‘skilled’ Filipino origin workers in Singapore negotiate the different national meanings they embody and contribute to the nation-building processes in both countries...|$|R

EIT can generate images of contrasts in electrical properties. The main advantage of using EIT is its high temporal resolution. In this paper motion information is extracted from EIT images and incorporated directly in the CBCT reconstruction. In this study synthetic moving data are generated using simulated and experimental phantoms.

40|$|Background: Image {{blurring}} in mammography {{can cause}} significant image degradation and interpretational problems. A potential source {{is due to}} paddle movement during image formation. Paddle movement {{has been shown to}} be as much as 1. 5 mm. No study has yet been performed to determine how much motion would be noticeable, visually. Objectives: To determine the minimum amount of simulated breast <b>movement</b> at which <b>blurring</b> can be detected visually. Method: 25 artefact free mammogram images were selected. Mathematical simulation software was created to mimic the effect of blurring produced by breast movement during exposure. Motion simulation was imposed to 15 levels, from 0. 1 mm to 1. 5 mm stepping through 0. 1 mm increments. 15 degraded images and 1 without blurring were de-identified, randomized and assessed on a blinded basis by two clinical experts to determine presence or absence of blurring. Statistical testing was carried out to determine the consistency between the two observers. Results: The probability of simulated blurred image detection is highest for the Gaussian method and lowest for soft edged mask estimation. Conclusion: The amount of simulated breast <b>movement</b> at which <b>blurring</b> can be detected visually for Gaussian blur, hard edge mask estimation, and soft edge mask estimation are 0. 4 mm, 0. 8 mm and 0. 7 mm respectively.

In this dissertation, I illustrate the interactive nature of strategic framing {{processes of the}} American pro-life and pro-choice movements and the process whereby movements borrow and co-opt language and imagery from opposing movements. Illustrated by two case studies of reactive and strategic counterframing in the pro-choice and pro-life movements, I show how such framing complicates the boundaries between these movements' ideologies. What was once demarcated as progressive becomes a champion of conservative causes and vice versa. I extend social movement theories of interactive framing processes and boundary demarcation by contributing an analysis of instances where activists blur ideological boundaries between movements and risk weakening the collective identification of movement adherents. I have identified two "cases"� that exemplify this interactive framing process and the subsequent blurring of ideological boundaries between the pro-life and pro-choice movements [...] 1) pro-choice activists framing abortion as "good mothering" � and 2) pro-life activists framing abortion as "Black genocide". � I argue that as each movement responds to countermovement threats by borrowing and co-opting language and imagery from the opposing movement, the ideological boundaries between the pro-life and pro-choice <b>movements</b> are <b>blurred.</b> Blurred boundaries threaten the stability of each movement by weakening collective identity ties and risk marginalizing and alienating certain movement adherents...|$|R

40|$|In this work, a new {{variant of}} {{particle}} filter has been proposed. In visual object tracking, particle filters {{have been used}} popularly because they are compatible with system non-linearity and non-Gaussian posterior distribution. But the main problem in particle filtering is sample degeneracy. To solve this problem, a new variant of particle filter has been proposed. The resampling algorithm used in this proposed particle filter is derived by combining systematic resampling, which is commonly used in SIR-PF (Sampling Importance Resampling Particle Filter) and a modified bat algorithm; this resampling algorithm reduces sample degeneracy as well as sample impoverishments. The measurement model is modified to handle clutter in presence of varying background. A new motion dynamics model is proposed which further reduces the chance of sample degeneracy among the particles by adaptively shifting mean of the process noise. To deal with illumination fluctuation and object deformation in presence of complete occlusion, a template update algorithm has also been proposed. This template update algorithm can update template even when {{the difference in the}} spread of the color-histogram is especially large over time. The proposed tracker has been tested against many challenging conditions and found to be robust against clutter, illumination change, scale change, fast object <b>movement,</b> motion <b>blur,</b> and complete occlusion; it has been found that the proposed algorithm outperforms the SIR-PF (Sampling Importance Resampling Particle Filter), bat algorithm and some other state-of-the-art tracking algorithms...|$|R

40|$|The long felt {{contrast}} between {{economic growth and}} environmental protection is dissipating in environmental and industrial policy in Europe. Sustainable development has become the leading motive in environmental policy in this regard. In trying to give meaning to this abstract concept, current environmental policies build on the ideas of ecological modernization. Although often advocated, relatively little experience exists of putting the theories of ecological modernization into practice. This paper makes an attempt to develop a regional perspective. Alongside the notion of ecological modernization the necessity of collaboration has emerged. Throughout Europe one can witness a <b>movement</b> that <b>blurs</b> the lines between governments and private actors.

Different options for improvements are identified in the paper. Apart from these concrete options, the management of the process of implementing industrial ecology proves to be the crucial success factor. The paper makes a case for building a regional consortium as a first step. By bringing possible partners together at least the options for cooperation can be assessed, planned and managed.

These eye <b>movements</b> avoid motion <b>blur</b> of moving objects which would obstruct the analysis of the objects’ visual details. However, these eye movements can only be executed if there is a moving target. So there is a very close and inseparable relationship between smooth pursuit and motion processing. The hub for visual motion processing is situated in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) area. Despite the undoubted importance of these areas for the generation of smooth pursuit or goal-directed behavior in general, {{it is important to keep}} in mind that motion processing in addition serves perceptual purposes such as object recognition, structure-from-motion detection, scene segmentation, self-motion estimation and depth perception. This review focuses at the beginning on pursuit-related activity recorded from MT and MST, subsequently extends the view to goal-directed hand movements, and finally addresses the possible contributions of these areas to motion perception...|$|R

In particular, there is a striking challenge when the limits and identity of this <b>movement</b> are very <b>blurred.</b> In this paper we adopt a triple strategy of analysis: 1) we consider that the multiple goals of the movement and, thus, any assessment of its impacts, depend on its structural conditions of emergence and first stage of development; 2) we argue that the self-reproduction of the movement is a significant impact beyond its ability to keep alive the mobilisation although any resulting group, campaign and movement provides specific contexts where claims are meaningful; 3) we distinguish the different scales, contexts and power relationships where the impacts may be identified and qualified, instead of just mirroring the initial opportunities and constraints in a deterministic way. The empirical evidence used in this research stems from secondary sources of information such as mass media coverage, data and opinions provided by the movement organisations and on-line social networks. Our analysis shows that the institutional impacts of the 15 M movement have been very limited, in spite of some successful lawsuits and a permanent capacity to challenge th...|$|R

This {{may help to}} explain the effects of Eye Movement and Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) {{in the treatment of}} post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in which patients make EM during trauma recall. Earlier experimental studies on recall + EM have focused on emotional memories. WM theory suggests that recall + EM is superior to recall only but is silent about effects of memory emotionality. Based on the emotion and memory literature, we examined whether recall + EM has superior effects in blurring emotional memories relative to neutral memories. Healthy volunteers recalled negative or neutral memories, matched for vividness, while visually tracking a dot that moved horizontally ("recall + EM") or remained stationary ("recall only"). Compared to a pre-test, a post-test (without concentrating on the dot) replicated earlier findings: negative memories are rated as less vivid after "recall + EM" but not after "recall only". This was not found for neutral memories. Emotional memories are more taxing than neutral memories, which may explain the findings. Alternatively, transient arousal induced by recall of aversive memories may promote reconsolidation of the blurred memory image that is provoked by EM. © 2013 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
5000|$|Miriam Schapiro (or Shapiro) (also {{known as}} Mimi) (November 15, 1923 - June 20, 2015) was a Canadian-born artist {{based in the}} United States. She was a painter, sculptor, printmaker, and a pioneer of feminist art. She was also {{considered}} {{a leader of the}} Pattern and Decoration art <b>movement.</b> Schapiro's artwork <b>blurs</b> the line between fine art and craft. She incorporated craft elements into her paintings due to their association with women and femininity. Schapiro’s work touches on the issue of feminism and art: especially in the aspect of feminism in relation to abstract art. Schapiro honed in her domesticated craft work and was able to create work that stood amongst the rest of the high art. These works represent Schapiro’s identity as an artist working in the center of contemporary abstraction and simultaneously as a feminist being challenged to represent women’s “consciousness” through imagery. She often used icons that are associated with women, such as hearts, floral decorations, geometric patterns, and the color pink. In the 1970s she made the hand fan, a typically small woman's object, heroic by painting it six feet by twelve feet. [...] "The fan-shaped canvas, a powerful icon, gave Schapiro the opportunity to experiment... Out of this emerged a surface of textured coloristic complexity and opulence that formed the basis of her new personal style. The kimonos, fans, houses, and hearts were the form into which she repeatedly poured her feelings and desires, her anxieties, and hopes".|$|R

University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2016 “Five Ekmousikés” is a multi-movement work {{composed}} for solo piano, dedicated to {{and to be}} premiered by my grandmother, Dr. Janet Bass Smith. Each movement in this work is programmatically tied {{to a piece of}} extra-musical art by Dr. Smith, consisting of three oil paintings and two poems. Chronologically, the movements are ordered “Sunset on Barren River Lake”, “Alone in Mammoth Cave”, “The Color of Death”, “Winter Peace”, and “Trifid Nebula”. As a child, I was often struck by paintings of my grandmother. I remember examining them with a sense of wonder - their use of color, substance, and texture leaving a deep impression on me at a young age. In “Five Ekmousikés”, I strove to celebrate the artistic achievements of my grandmother (musical and otherwise), acknowledge her influence on my own aesthetic, and attempt to capture the qualities of her art in musical form. The word “ekmousikés” is my own adaptation from the term “ekphrasis”, a literary technique used to create a verbal or rhetorical description of another work of art, typically from the visual medium. Each movement is intended as a musical analogue its corresponding work, as opposed to simply existing as music that was inspired by those works. This may be most obvious in the movement “Winter Peace”. The painting depicts an inhabited cabin, situated in a valley within a range of mountains. The cabin appears to be a small and meek human element in comparison to its rather looming surroundings, and a snowstorm blurs the landscape. I depicted this musically by writing a simple melody, representing the human element, and placing that melody “inside” of a louder and more harmonically volatile texture, symbolizing the overbearing landscape. The sustain pedal remains down the entire <b>movement</b> to <b>blur</b> the resulting sonorities in the same way the snowstorm blurred the mountainside in her painting. My thought processes in composing the other four movements of “Five Ekmousikés” were similar in manner. The texts for “Alone in Mammoth Cave” and “The Color of Death” are included prior to each movement in the score. Performance notes [...] Score.
