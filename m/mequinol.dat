50|$|<b>Mequinol</b> is {{a common}} active {{ingredient}} in topical drugs used for skin depigmentation. As a topical drug <b>Mequinol</b> is often mixed with tretinoin, a topical retinoid. A common formulation for this drug is an ethanolic solution of 2% <b>Mequinol</b> and 0.01% tretinoin by mass. Dermatologists commonly prescribe the drug to treat solar lentigines, liver spots, or age spots.|$|E
50|$|Increasingly, {{people who}} are not afflicted with the {{vitiligo}} experiment with lower concentrations of monobenzone creams in the hope of lightning their skin tone evenly. An alternate method of lightning is to use the chemical <b>mequinol</b> {{over an extended period of}} time. Both monobenzone and <b>mequinol</b> produce dramatic skin whitening, but react very differently. <b>Mequinol</b> leaves the skin looking extremely pale. However, tanning is still possible. It is important to notice that the skin will not go back to its original color after the none treatment of <b>mequinol.</b> <b>Mequinol</b> should not be used by people that are allergic to any ingredient in <b>mequinol,</b> if you are pregnant, if you have eczema, irritated or inflamed skin, an increased number of white blood cells or if you are sensitive to sunlight or must be outside for prolonged periods of time. <b>Mequinol</b> is used in Europe in concentrations ranging from 2-20% and is approved in many countries for the treatment of solar lentigines. Monobenzone applied topically completely removes pigment in the long term and vigorous sun-safety must to be adhered to for life to avoid severe sun burn and melanomas. People using monobenzone without previously having vitiligo do so because standard products containing hydroquinone or other lightning agents are not effective for their skin and due to price and active ingredient strength. However, monobenzone is not recommended for skin conditions other than vitiligo.|$|E

50|$|Lower dosages of <b>mequinol</b> {{have been}} used in {{conjunction}} with a Q-switched laser to depigment skin in patients with disseminated idiopathic vitiligo.|$|E
50|$|In {{cases of}} {{extensive}} vitiligo {{the option to}} de-pigment the unaffected skin with topical drugs like monobenzone, <b>mequinol,</b> or hydroquinone may be considered to render the skin an even colour. The removal of all the skin pigment with monobenzone is permanent and vigorous. Sun-safety must be adhered to for life to avoid severe sun burn and melanomas. Depigmentation takes about a year to complete.|$|E
50|$|Most commonly, {{depigmentation}} of {{the skin}} is linked to people born with vitiligo, which produces differing areas {{of light and dark}} skin. These individuals, if they so decided to use a lightening process to even out their skin tone, could apply a topical cream containing the organic compound monobenzone to lessen the remaining pigment. Monobenzone may cause destruction of melanocytes and permanent depigmentation. An alternate method of lightening is to use the chemical <b>mequinol</b> {{over an extended period of}} time. Increasingly, people who are not afflicted with the vitiligo experiment with lower concentrations of monobenzone creams in the hope of lightening their skin tone evenly.

40|$|Catalytic {{amounts of}} NaNO 2 {{are able to}} {{successfully}} promote the reaction between 1, 4 -hydroquinone and methanol under acidic conditions, affording selectively the corresponding <b>mequinol</b> in excellent isolated yields. According to the proposed reaction mechanism, the semi-quinone intermediate, generated in situ from the corresponding hydroquinone by NO 2 oxidation, is the real reactive species, undergoing nucleophilic attack onto the alcoholic molecule. Experimental evidences emphasize the key role of NO 2. After optimization of the reaction conditions, {{the scope of the}} proposed protocol is extended to a wider range of alcohols, providing the corresponding mono-ethers in good to excellent yields. Moreover, when substituted hydroquinones are selected as reactive substrates, monoetherification occurs with complete regio-selectivity towards the less hindered phenolic –OH group...|$|E
40|$|Deactivation of excited {{electronic}} {{states through}} coupling to dissociative 1 πσ* states in heteroaromatic systems has received considerable attention in recent years, particularly {{as a mechanism}} {{that contributes to the}} ultraviolet (UV) photostability of numerous aromatic biomolecules and their chromophores. Recent studies have expanded upon this work to look at more complex species, which involves understanding competing dynamics on two different 1 πσ* potential energy surfaces (PESs) localized on different heteroatom hydride coordinates (O–H and N–H bonds) within the same molecule. In a similar spirit, the work presented here utilizes ultrafast time-resolved velocity map ion imaging to study competing dissociation pathways along 1 πσ* PESs in <b>mequinol</b> (p-methoxyphenol), localized at O–H and O–CH 3 bonds yielding H atoms or CH 3 radicals, respectively, over an excitation wavelength range of 298 – 238 nm and at 200 nm. H atom elimination is found to be operative via either tunneling under a conical intersection (CI) (298 ≥ λ ≥ 280 nm) or ultrafast internal conversion through appropriate CIs (λ ≤ 245 nm), both of which provide mechanisms for coupling onto the dissociative state associated with the O–H bond. In the intermediate wavelength range of 280 ≥ λ ≥ 245 nm, mediated H atom elimination is not observed. In contrast, we find that state driven CH 3 radical elimination is only observed in the excitation range 264 ≥ λ ≥ 238 nm. Interpretation of these experimental results is guided by: (i) high level complete active space with second order perturbation theory (CASPT 2) calculations, which provide 1 -D potential energy cuts of the ground and low lying singlet excited electronic states along the O–H and O–CH 3 bond coordinates; and (ii) calculated excitation energies using CASPT 2 and the equation-of-motion coupled cluster with singles and doubles excitations (EOM-CCSD) formalism. From these comprehensive studies, we find that the dynamics along the O–H coordinate generally mimic H atom elimination previously observed in phenol, whereas O–CH 3 bond fission in <b>mequinol</b> appears to present notably different behavior to the CH 3 elimination dynamics previously observed in anisole (methoxybenzene) ...|$|E
40|$|Postinflammatory {{hyperpigmentation}} is {{a common}} sequelae of inflammatory dermatoses that tends to affect darker skinned patients with greater frequency and severity. Epidemiological studies show that dyschromias, including postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, {{are among the most}} common reasons darker racial/ethnic groups seek the care of a dermatologist. The treatment of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation should be started early to help hasten its resolution and begins with management of the initial inflammatory condition. First-line therapy typically consists of topical depigmenting agents in addition to photoprotection including a sunscreen. Topical tyrosinase inhibitors, such as hydroquinone, azelaic acid, kojic acid, arbutin, and certain licorice extracts, can effectively lighten areas of hypermelanosis. Other depigmenting agents include retinoids, <b>mequinol,</b> ascorbic acid, niacinamide, N-acetyl glucosamine, and soy with a number of emerging therapies on the horizon. Topical therapy is typically effective for epidermal postinflammatory hyperpigmentation; however, certain procedures, such as chemical peeling and laser therapy, may help treat recalcitrant hyperpigmentation. It is also important to use caution with all of the above treatments to prevent irritation and worsening of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation...|$|E
40|$|Melasma is {{a common}} hypermelanotic {{disorder}} affecting the face {{that is associated with}} considerable psychological impacts. The management of melasma is challenging and requires a long-term treatment plan. In addition to avoidance of aggravating factors like oral pills and ultraviolet exposure, topical therapy has remained the mainstay of treatment. Multiple options for topical treatment are available, of which hydroquinone (HQ) is the most commonly prescribed agent. Besides HQ, other topical agents for which varying degrees of evidence for clinical efficacy exist include azelaic acid, kojic acid, retinoids, topical steroids, glycolic acid, <b>mequinol,</b> and arbutin. Topical medications modify various stages of melanogenesis, the most common mode of action being inhibition of the enzyme, tyrosinase. Combination therapy is the preferred mode of treatment for the synergism and reduction of untoward effects. The most popular combination consists of HQ, a topical steroid, and retinoic acid. Prolonged HQ usage may lead to untoward effects like depigmentation and exogenous ochronosis. The search for safer alternatives has given rise to the development of many newer agents, several of them from natural sources. Well-designed controlled clinical trials are needed to clarify their role in the routine management of melasma...|$|E

A number of VOCs were specifically linked with confused flour beetle T. confusum and not observed with the other insect and mite species. For instance, 2 -methyl-p-benzoquinone and 2 -ethyl-p-benzoquinone were specifically linked to confused flour beetle. However, this study found that benzoquinones were not present in the headspace volatiles of the larvae of confused flour beetle, whereas, 1 -pentadecene was detected in adults and larvae of confused flour beetle. The results of the volatile extraction experiments with saw-toothed grain beetles O. surinamensis showed that several volatiles were detected in the adults and larvae of saw-toothed grain beetle {{but not in the}} other insect and mite species. Some of these VOCs were detected only in adults, and these were butanoic acid, 1 -methylethyl ester and 1, 3 -octadiene. The others were found in both larvae and adults. These were 2, 4 -hexadien- 1 -ol, octane, 3 -methylbutanoic acid, 2, 5 -dimethylpyrazine, 1 -octen- 3 -one and 1 -octen- 3 -ol. The analysis of the headspace from grain weevil S. granarius showed three VOCs which were specifically linked to weevils compared to the other species. These were <b>mequinol,</b> 2 -methylpropanoic acid and 2 -pentanone. The results showed that the known mite-produced alarm pheromone citral (comprising (Z) - 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2, 6 -octadienal and (E) - 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2, 6 -octadienal) was detected in both mite species flour mite A. siro and storage mite G. domesticus but not in insect species.
