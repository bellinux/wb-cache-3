The dissertation examines {{the quantity and quality}} of compost-like outputs produced in Ireland and what they are used for. The amount of compost-like outputs produced in 2011 was slightly below 20 000 tonnes, indicating that the treatment of biodegradable <b>waste</b> from <b>mixed</b> <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> is still low in Ireland. The study revealed that compost-like outputs cannot be used as a resource in Ireland. Waste regulations in Ireland do not permit compost-like outputs to be used for any other purpose other than disposal by landfill. The results of the analysis of compost-like outputs produced in Ireland indicate that their quality would meet the quality requirements of the United Kingdom standard for the end-use of compost-like outputs for land restoration. The analytical results show that compost-like outputs are a source of plant nutrients and organic matter. The results also show that compost-like outputs are a source of harmful substances that can cause a risk to the environment and human health...|$|R

The aeration mode of T 4 was in favor of reduced the H 2 S and CH 4 emission during MSW bio-drying. Under the condition of this study, the bio-drying cycle should be determined for 18 days.

40|$|A complex mechanical–biological waste {{treatment}} plant {{designed for the}} processing of <b>mixed</b> <b>municipal</b> solid <b>wastes</b> (MSW) and source-selected organic fraction of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>wastes</b> (OFMSW) has been studied by using stability indices related to aerobic (respiration index, RI) and anaerobic conditions (biochemical methane potential, BMP). Several selected stages of the plant have been characterized: waste inputs, mechanically treated wastes, anaerobically digested materials and composted wastes, according to the treatment sequence used in the plant. Results obtained showed that the main stages responsible for waste stabilization were the two first stages: mechanical separation and anaerobic digestion with a diminution of both RI and BMP around 40 % and 60 %, respectively, whereas the third stage, composting of digested materials, produced lesser biological degradation (20 – 30 %). The results related to waste stabilization were similar in both lines (MSW and OFMSW), although the indices obtained for MSW were significantly lower than those obtained for OFMSW, which demonstrated a high biodegradability of OFMSW.

40|$|A massive {{characterization}} {{in terms}} of respiration activity for the most common types of organic solid wastes is presented in this compilation. Respiration activity for a solid waste is a crucial parameter to understand the behaviour of the waste in the environment and for waste management aspects such as {{the definition of a}} suitable biological treatment and the determination of the potential rate of microbial self-heating if organic wastes are to be used as solid recovered fuels. The respiration data compiled in this work are the result of five years of research focused on the determination of the biological activity of organic wastes.

The main groups of organic <b>wastes</b> analyzed are: <b>municipal</b> solid <b>wastes</b> (including <b>mixed</b> wastes and source-selected organic fraction), wastewater sludge (including digested and nondigested sludge from primary and secondary operations in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants), different types of manure (of different origin), other particular wastes (animal by-products, hair waste, fats, etc.) and some mixtures of different wastes.
