25|$|Devolving {{power to}} consumers. Some proponents have {{suggested}} that ethical food markets – and the PGS framework directly – has furthered a 'cash till' form of political democracy, whereby consumer spending power can masquerade as a legitimate governance structure and mechanism (i.e. democratically voted, representative, and therefore accountable). This {{is part of a}} broader shift from forms of 'government' to 'governance' seen in a neoliberalizing world, where a raft of non-state actors, arguably, <b>make</b> <b>informed</b> <b>decisions</b> about where and what to purchase.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{opposing}} {{sides of the}} sex education argument amongst parents: the sexual liberals and the sexual conservatives.

Sexual conservatives see knowledge on sex as encouraging adolescents to have sex, and they believe that sex should be taught inside the family in order for their morals {{to be included in the}} conversation. Sexual conservatives see the importance of teaching sex education, but only through abstinence-only programs.|$|E

25|$|After The Tipping Point, Gladwell {{published}} Blink in 2005. The book {{explains how}} the human unconscious interprets events or cues and how past experiences can lead people to <b>make</b> <b>informed</b> <b>decisions</b> very rapidly, using examples like the Getty kouros and psychologist John Gottman's {{research on the}} likelihood of divorce in married couples. Gladwell's hair was the inspiration for Blink. He stated that he started to get speeding tickets all the time, an oddity considering {{that he had never}} gotten one before, and that he started getting pulled out of airport security lines for special attention. In a particular incident, he was accosted by three police officers while walking in downtown Manhattan, because his curly hair matched the profile of a rapist, {{despite the fact that the}} suspect looked nothing like him otherwise.|$|E
25|$|The {{answer to}} the appellant's action lay in the navy's offer of an {{alternative}} post to the appellant immediately prior to his resignation. Given {{the background of the}} appellant's case, the Navy could not be faulted for not returning the appellant to his original post. In the particular circumstances, however, the law clearly placed a duty on the employer to consult fully with the employee affected and to share information to enable him to <b>make</b> <b>informed</b> <b>decisions.</b> The navy, noted Cameron, had not fulfilled that responsibility: Explaining the job offer was anything but superfluous, since it was an entirely new position, and in addition the appellant's subjective condition of suspicion, demoralisation and depression, which was evident to those dealing with him, was materially relevant to how the navy was required by fairness to deal with him. His condition meant that an unexplained offer of a new post was likely to be rejected. The lack of explanation, follow-up and elucidation did not constitute fair dealing. The navy had breached its common-law duty to treat Murray fairly, thus rendering his resignation a constructive dismissal.|$|E
25|$|Over 100 {{pieces of}} {{statuary}} {{had been sold}} from the gardens in 1848, 1921 and 1922, so {{it was decided to}} replace them gradually with replicas as and when funds could be raised. In 1989-90 Peter Inskip assessed the condition of the buildings. Work on the restoration of the buildings, based on this survey, was then prioritised. The major restorations have been the Grenville Column (1991), the Temple of Ancient Virtue (1992), the Oxford Gates and Lodges (1994), the Temple of Venus (1995) and the Temple of Concord & Victory (1996). This last had been severely compromised when 16 columns had been removed to build the new school chapel in 1926. Replacement columns were carved and the building re-roofed at the cost of £1,300,000. The cost of this first stage was £10,000,000, the money coming from several sources: a public appeal, the Heritage Lottery Fund and grants from English Heritage as well as private donors and other grant-giving bodies. The restoration process adopted an approach where each building, or element of the gardens was informed by archaeology. In order to <b>make</b> <b>informed</b> <b>decisions</b> about what to restore and why, archaeological techniques such as geophysics, excavation, building recording and monitoring {{in the form of an}} archaeological watching brief were all utilised.|$|E
