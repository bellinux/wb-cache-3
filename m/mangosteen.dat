40|$|In Eastern Thailand, {{the harvest}} cycle of <b>mangosteens</b> and durians begins {{sometime}} in December, {{after the end}} of the rainy season.

Using statistical analysis, we can infer the October weather condition from the onset date of the rainy season in May. Such knowledge enables a prediction model that allows fruit farmers to plan their crop strategically well ahead of time...|$|R
