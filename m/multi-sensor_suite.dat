40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1996 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe Defense Evaluation Support Activity (DESA) is an {{independent}} Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) activity that provides tailored evaluation support to government organizations. DESA provides quick-response support capabilities and performs activities ranging from studies to large-scale field activities that include deployment, instrumentation, site setup, event execution, analysis and report writing. The National Guard Bureau requested DESA's assistance {{in the development and}} field testing of the Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) Sensor Suite (LSS). LSS was integrated by DESA to provide a <b>multi-sensor</b> <b>suite</b> that detects and identifies ground targets on foot or in vehicles with minimal operator workload. The LSS was designed primarily for deployment in high density drug trafficking areas along the northern and southern borders using primarily commercial-off-the-shelf and government-off-the-shelf equipment. Field testing of the system prototype in summer of 1995 indicates that the LSS will provide a significant new data collection and transfer capability to the National Guard in control of illegal drug transfer across the U. S. borders...|$|E
40|$|The Department of Aerospace Science and Technology of the Politecnico di Mila-no has an {{consolidated}} {{tradition in}} flight testing education. The present paper presents Chip-py, the latest {{addition to the}} “Flight Testing” MSc course assets. It is a 640 g maximum take off mass, 1200 mm wingspan, 250 W electrical motor powered, in-house developed un-manned air vehicle. Chippy is conceived {{to serve as an}} effective, dependable, very-low-cost platform to provide students with an initial, hands-on flight testing experience, preparatory for the subsequent first person test flight core activity included in the course syllabus. It features a <b>multi-sensor</b> <b>suite</b> (GPS, inertial data, magnetometer, air data, propulsion data, system state), an on-board secure digital memory card-based data recorder and a 802. 15. 4, 2. 4 GHz-based telemetry link to the ground station. Among the more traditional tasks performed by the on board avionics it is worth to be mentioned the electronic flight test system, by means of which it is possible to define at mission planning time a sequence of test points, load them on the electronic flight card subsystem and have the on board test point director, triggered by the pilot on ground, autonomously execute them. Results of the validation flights campaign, per-formed in second quarter of 2014, are presented...|$|E
40|$|We present work on {{methods and}} user {{interfaces}} developed for interactive mining for Feature Foundation Data (e. g. roads, rivers, orchards, forests) in fused <b>multi-sensor</b> imagery. A <b>suite</b> of client-server based tools, including the Site Mining Tool and Image Map Interface, enable image analysts (IA) to mine multisensor imagery for feature foundation data {{and to share}} trainable search agents, search results, and image annotations with other IAs connected via a computer network. We discuss extensions to the Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network which enable the Site Mining Tool to report confidence measures for detected search targets and to automatically select the critical features in the input vector which are most relevant for particular searches. Examples {{of the use of}} the Site Mining Tool and Image Map Interface are shown for an EO, IR, SAR data set derived from Landsat and Radarsat imagery, as well as multispectral (4 -band) and hyperspectral (224 band) data sets. In addtion, we present an architecture for the enhancement of hyperspectral fused imagery that utilizes internal category activity maps of a trained Fuzzy ARTMAP network to enhance the visualization of targets in the color-fused imagery...|$|R
40|$|NASA has a {{continuing}} requirement to collect high-quality in situ {{data for the}} vicarious calibration of current and next generation ocean color satellite sensors and to validate the algorithms that use the remotely sensed observations. Recent NASA airborne missions over Monterey Bay, CA, have demonstrated novel above- and in-water measurement capabilities supporting a combined airborne sensor approach (imaging spectrometer, microradiometers, and a sun photometer). The results characterize coastal atmospheric and aquatic properties through an end-to-end assessment of image acquisition, atmospheric correction, algorithm application, plus sea-truth observations from state-of-the-art instrument systems. The primary goal is to demonstrate the following in support of calibration and validation exercises for satellite coastal ocean color products: 1) the utility of a <b>multi-sensor</b> airborne instrument <b>suite</b> to assess the bio-optical properties of coastal California, including water quality; and 2) the importance of contemporaneous atmospheric measurements to improve atmospheric correction in the coastal zone. The imaging spectrometer (Headwall) is optimized in the blue spectral domain to emphasize remote sensing of marine and freshwater ecosystems. The novel airborne instrument, Coastal Airborne In-situ Radiometers (C-AIR) provides measurements of apparent optical properties with high dynamic range and fidelity for deriving exact water leaving radiances at the land-ocean boundary, including radiometrically shallow aquatic ecosystems. Simultaneous measurements supporting empirical atmospheric correction of image data are accomplished using the Ames Airborne Tracking Sunphotometer (AATS- 14). Flight operations are presented for the instrument payloads using the Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS) Twin Otter flown over Monterey Bay during the seasonal fall algal bloom in 2011 (COAST) and 2013 (OCEANIA) to support bio-optical measurements of phytoplankton for coastal zone research...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, coastal marine {{ecosystems}} {{are exposed to}} land-based sources of pollution and sedimentation from anthropogenic activities including agriculture and coastal development. Ocean color products from satellite sensors provide information on chlorophyll (phytoplankton pigment), sediments, and colored dissolved organic material. Further, ship-based in-water measurements and emerging airborne measurements provide in situ data for the vicarious calibration of current and next generation satellite ocean color sensors and to validate the algorithms that use the remotely sensed observations. Recent NASA airborne missions over Monterey Bay, CA, have demonstrated novel above- and in-water measurement capabilities supporting a combined airborne sensor approach (imaging spectrometer, microradiometers, and a sun photometer).

Utilizing an imaging spectrometer optimized in the blue to green spectral domain enables higher signal for detection of the relatively dark radiance measurements from marine and freshwater ecosystem features. The novel airborne instrument, Coastal Airborne In-situ Radiometers (C-AIR) provides measurements of apparent optical properties with high dynamic range and fidelity for deriving exact water leaving radiances at the land-ocean boundary, including radiometrically shallow aquatic ecosystems.

Further, this airborne capability can be responsive to first flush rain events that deliver higher concentrations of sediments and pollution to coastal waters via watersheds and overland flow...|$|R
