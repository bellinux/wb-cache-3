40|$|This article {{presents}} our contributions to expert search and discussion search of Enterprise Track in TREC 2006. In discussion search, we {{take advantage of}} the redundant patterns of emails, such as the subject, author, sent time, etc., which we incorporate in a field-based weighting method to mine discussion topics with more robustness. Some non-content features, such as time-line and <b>mail</b> <b>thread</b> are found to be useful as experiments showed they improve the precision of the search. In expert search, two variants of the BM 25 and DFR_BM 25 weighting models- namely V-BM 25 and V-DFR_BM 25 - are put forward. Query-based document length, not profile length, is used as document length in these weighting models to eliminate multiple topic drift. In addition, we propose a variant of an existing phrase weighting model to decrease topic confusion (V-phrase) and a two-stage field-based search method to refine the results. We demonstrate these approaches can effectively improve expert search. 2. Discussion Search In this section, related work is presented firstly; secondly data cleaning and feature extraction is introduced; thirdly terminology and methods we used are discussed; at last submitted runs are listed. 2. 1 Related wor...|$|E
30|$|Our {{approach}} {{has been applied to}} three different datasets. First, we chose the open source software development project Asterisk. Here, the dataset originated from the communications in the developer mailing lists during 2006 and 2007. The Asterisk dataset contains 13, 542 messages and 4694 threads that were discussed by 1324 developers. Two actors are linked if they participated in the same <b>mailing</b> <b>thread.</b> Figure 5 shows an example of an actor a participating once in the same <b>mailing</b> <b>thread</b> with actor b and having shared two <b>mailing</b> <b>threads</b> with actor c. According to our approach and the timestamps in Asterisk dataset, we decomposed the P-period into eight P-slices. According to Definitions 7 and 8, we got eight P-subgraphs and seven S-subgraphs.|$|R

The Desktop connector allows drag and drop export of the users' files; Microsoft Outlook connector allows publishing of messages, attachments or entire <b>mail</b> <b>threads</b> from Microsoft Outlook.|$|R

50|$|A new {{generation}} of tools to support collaborative intelligence is poised to evolve from crowdsourcing platforms, recommender systems, and evolutionary computation. Existing tools to facilitate group problem-solving include collaborative groupware, such as GitHub, Google+, Confluence, eXo Platform, JIRA, Skype, NetMeeting, WebEx, and synchronous conferencing technologies such as instant messaging, online chat and shared white boards, which are complemented by asynchronous messaging like electronic <b>mail,</b> <b>threaded,</b> moderated discussion forums, web logs, and group Wikis. Managing the Intelligent Enterprise relies on these tools, as well as methods for group member interaction; promotion of creative thinking; group membership feedback; quality control and peer review; and a documented group memory or knowledge base. As groups work together, they develop a shared memory, which is accessible through the collaborative artifacts created by the group, including meeting minutes, transcripts from threaded discussions, and drawings. The shared memory (group memory) is also accessible through the memories of group members; current interest focuses on how technology can support and augment the effectiveness of shared past memory and capacity for future problem-solving. Metaknowledge characterizes how knowledge content interacts with its knowledge context in cross-disciplinary, multi-institutional, or global distributed collaboration.|$|R
50|$|The online {{learning}} resources {{used to support}} asynchronous learning include email, electronic <b>mailing</b> lists, <b>threaded</b> conferencing systems, online discussion boards, wikis, and blogs. Course management systems such as CampusCruiser LMS, Desire2Learn, Blackboard, WebCT, Moodle, and Sakai, {{have been developed to}} support online interaction, allowing users to organize discussions, post and reply to messages, and upload and access multimedia. These asynchronous forms of communication are sometimes supplemented with synchronous components, including text and voice chat, telephone conversations, videoconferencing, and even meetings in virtual spaces such as Second Life, where discussions can be facilitated among groups of students.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{important}} characteristics of Web-based courses is that they utilize different Internet tools {{to close the gap}} between the instructor and the learner. Although many different Internet tools (including course Web sites, e-mail, electronic <b>mailing</b> lists, <b>threaded</b> discussion group, chat, instant messaging, audio conferencing, and video conferencing) can be used today to close this gap, {{there are a number of}} problems with the existing tools. According to the literature, current problems with tools that support Web-based instruction include: finding appropriate software for students and instructors; access control to keep outsiders from disrupting class communication; training students and instructors in the use of various software packages; and cost of acquisition and use of appropriate tools. This paper introduces ICQ Active List, an Internet tool which can support a Web-based distance education community by eliminating all of these problems. The paper also discusses the issue of creating an online community, which is ver...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Web of data {{promotes}} {{the idea that}} more and more data are interconnected. A step towards this goal is to bring more structured annotations to existing documents using common vocabularies or ontolo-gies. Semi-structured texts such as scientific, medical or news articles as well as forum and archived <b>mailing</b> list <b>threads</b> or (micro-) blog posts can hence be semantically annotated. Named Entity (NE) extractors play a key role for extracting structured information by identifying features, also called entities, and by linking them to other web resources by means of typed inferences. In this article, we propose a thorough evaluation of five popular Linked Data entity extractors which expose APIs: Alche-myAPI, DBPedia Spotlight, Extractiv, OpenCalais and Zemanta. We present NERD, an evaluation framework we have developed and the re-sults of a controlled evaluation performed by human beings that consists in assigning a Boolean value to three criteria: entity detection, entity type and entity disambiguation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we address the task of finding topically {{relevant}} email messages in public discussion lists. We make two important observations. First, email messages are not isolated, but {{are part of a}} larger online environment. This context, existing on different levels, can be incorporated into the retrieval model. We explore the use of <b>thread,</b> <b>mailing</b> list, and community content levels, by expanding our original query with term from these sources. We find that query models based on contextual information improve retrieval effectiveness. Second, email is a relatively informal genre, and therefore offers scope for incorporating techniques previously shown useful in searching user-generated content. Indeed, our experiments show that using query-independent features (email length, thread size, and text quality), implemented as priors, results in further improvements. ...|$|R
40|$|We are {{studying}} here {{the use of}} e-mail {{by a group of}} individuals in a mailing list. This is a group of partners (from four European countries) working in a EU-funded RTD project, COMB (a pseudonym). The members of the COMB project have been communicating through the COMB-L mailing list. Originally this mailing list had started in August 2000 when the funding of the project was approved. Subsequently the discussions in the mailing list were concerning the negotiations with the EC for the formulation of the project contract. Eventually, the project started on May 1, 2001, and it is on-going at the moment; totally, it will last 30 months, i. e., it is expected to end up by November 2003. The primary data for this study consists of the transcripts of 1104 e-mails distributed in the COMB-L mailing list from August 22, 2000, until December 31, 2001. The data include the following information for each e-mail: (i) the date of distribution, (ii) the sender, (iii) the subject of the e-mail and (iv) the contents of the message body. From the above information, two principal variables are derived: The e-mail threads, i. e., groups of replies to distinct initial e-mails, which are extracted from the subjects of the e-mails. The e-mail genres, which are defined through a number of different categories, coded as present or absent, by reading the contents of the e-mails. Accordingly, our purpose is to undertake two analyses of the <b>mailing</b> list: a <b>thread</b> analysis and a genres analysis. In particular, in each one of these analyses, after giving some general statistics, we intend to generate the corresponding networks (for each month and for the whole period) and to compute certain important network parameters. ...|$|R
