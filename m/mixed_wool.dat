Her fashions began to exaggerate fullness in overblouses and the wide, flared, gored skirts she designed. Borea's bathing suits were short and flaring, made fromplain wool or checked cotton.

40|$|Jewish law forbids Sha’atnez – wearing <b>mixed</b> <b>wool</b> and linen {{together}} was forbidden for the Jewish population. The article will first explain {{the meaning and}} acronym of sha’atnez, and then review the sha’atnez textiles which {{were found in the}} Land of Israel. The possible reasons for the prohibition of sha’atnez will be presented and remarks on observance and enforcement of the law in Orthodox Jewish communities today will be made according to ethnographic investigation. 2 The concept of sha’atnez: Jewish law forbids sha’atnez – wearing garments of <b>mixed</b> <b>wool</b> and linen. This is mentioned twice in the Hebrew Bible: It is written in Leviticus 19 : 19, where it is stated that “you shall not put on cloth from a mixture of two kinds of material”. The prohibition of “the mixture of diverse kinds” of material is mentioned in additional contexts such as interbreeding different species of animals together, working different species of animals under the same yoke, and planting different species of seeds together in a single field. Sha’atnez garments are mentioned but the specific materials are not listed. In Deuteronomy 22 : 11, however, it is added that “You shall not wear cloth combining wool and linen”. Sha’atnez applies only to sheep’s wool and linen. Any other combination of plant and animal fibres does not create sha’atnez, such as the combinations of cotton, silk, camel hair, mohair, hemp or nettle. The wool and linen may not be spun, woven, sewn, tied, knotted, or knitted together for garment use. Even one linen thread found in a large garment of wool renders the entire garment sha’atnez. 3 Men and women are equally obligated in all the prohibitions of sha’atnez and it is also forbidden to clothe a child in sha’atnez garments. ...|$|E

It was also noted in the distribution of alleles and genotypes of scrapie a significant increase in their number, depending on the utility of higher specialisation of the studied sheep groups. Generally, allele ALRQ (also in the form of homozygotic genotype) dominated in mouflon, while in cultural breeds – ALRR.

40|$|Textile {{manufacturing}} {{played a}} significant role in the industrialization of Connecticut. It was the leading industry throughout the nineteenth century, and as late as 1920 it was still one of the state 2 ̆ 7 s most important industries. Yet despite its economic importance and the impact that it had on Connecticut 2 ̆ 7 s people, the subject has received little scholarly attention. Using surviving company records and local sources, this case study traces the rise and decline of the industry in Rockville, one of the state 2 ̆ 7 s largest wool textile manufacturing centers. ^ Formerly a city within the town of Vernon, Rockville is one of those numerous 2 ̆ 2 villes 2 ̆ 2 which originated in the early nineteenth century when the textile industry came to many inland Connecticut towns with water power. Because these early factories were often located in rural and isolated areas, their development and growth created entirely new villages within settled towns. Such was the case in Vernon where a cluster of mills along the falls of the Hockanum River grew into a factory village by 1840, and into the incorporated City of Rockville in 1889. ^ The study reviews the beginning of textile manufacturing in Connecticut and the semi-handicraft mills that gave rise to woolen manufacturing in Rockville. The early mills were initiated by Vernon farmers, used local sources of capital and rural labor, and produced a <b>mixed</b> <b>wool</b> and cotton cloth that replaced homespun. Conversion to all-wool cassimere in the 1840 s assured the continued success of Rockville 2 ̆ 7 s factories. Immigration, beginning in the 1850 s replaced the rural labor force. Five of Rockville 2 ̆ 7 s integrated woolen mills, consolidated in 1906 into the Hockanum Mills Company, attained spectacular success by specializing in high-quality worsted men 2 ̆ 7 s wear, a fabric that went unchallenged until the advent of synthetics in the late 1930 s. The study examines the relationship of the factory community to the industry as it coped with the problems of rapid urban growth by incorporating under a city charter. When the woolen industry declined in the second quarter of the twentieth century, the factory city of Rockville disappeared. ...|$|E

Textiles {{embodied}} in garments that are worn {{on the body}} all day, or in bed sheets slept under every night touch us literally, on a daily basis. Hence among all other materials, ‘naturalness perception’ has a strong impact on the preference for textile products. Nevertheless, a stark gap {{can be found in}} literature articulating when people appraise textiles as natural. Grounding on previously conducted studies on textile perception, we present an empirical study in which we determined three main aspects which might influence the perception of naturalness in textiles: (1) fiber origin, what it is actually made of (natural vs. artificial, or mixed), (2) yarn type (fine vs. thick yarn), (3) exploration mode, i. e. how people interact with textiles (e. g. touch only, vision only, both). The results show that pure wool and pure cotton textiles are perceived most natural. While <b>mixing</b> <b>wool</b> and cotton with polypropylene destroys the perception of naturalness, mixing in acrylic does not. Moreover, a thick yarn is perceived as most natural.
