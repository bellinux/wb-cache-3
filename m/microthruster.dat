LISA consists of three spacecraft in heliocentric orbits, forming a triangle with 5 x l 0 (exp 6) km sides that are the arms of three Michelson-type interferometers.

The potential of laserablative <b>microthrusters</b> for meeting these demands is being investigated at the Institute of Technical Physics [2, 3]. The concept is based on layer-by-layer removal of {{a thin layer of}} material by focusing short laser pulses on a metal surface creating plasma or vapor (laser ablation) [4]. The recoil of the ablated material leads to momentum transfer to the target, which results in sub-µN to mN thrust levels for high repetition rate laser sources [5]. Additionally, by implementing electro-optic beam steering, moving parts that can be a significant disturbing factor for precise thrusters can be avoided in this concept. A thrust balance based on a torsional pendulum has been constructed for measurements in vacuum. Sub-µN thrust levels have been measured in tests with a calibrated voice coil.
