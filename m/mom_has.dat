500|$|Discussions between Iwata, [...] Miyamoto, and Takeda about a {{new home}} console began {{in the first half}} of 2003. With {{encouragement}} from Yamauchi, Iwata pushed for development of a revolutionary product that would later become the Wii. Iwata subsequently assigned Takeda to the project, [...] "telling [...] to go off the tech roadmap." [...] The overall premise was that [...] "a <b>Mom</b> <b>has</b> to like it." [...] During the console's development process Iwata challenged engineers to make the Wii no thicker than three DVD cases stacked together, a feat they ultimately accomplished. Takeda and his team focused on reducing power consumption while retaining or improving levels of performance shown with the GameCube. Alongside the internal hardware designed by Nintendo's engineers, Iwata proposed that the console abandon use of a typical controller to make gaming more accessible to everyone. Miyamoto took the lead on developing a new controller while Takeda's team provided the internal components. After six months and dozens of scrapped prototypes, Takeda procured a CMOS sensor that later became the core aspect of the remote. With the addition of accelerometers, they were able to effectively produce motion controls.|$|E
500|$|Clair {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the greatest mothers in television history by several media publications. Time dubbed Clair [...] "America's favorite TV mom". Peoples Jane Hall hailed the character as America's [...] "No. 1 wife and mom" [...] while crowning Rashad [...] "TV's Reigning Mom" [...] in 1987. Hayley Krischer of Salon agreed that Clair is [...] "everyone’s favorite" [...] and [...] "undoubtedly the best TV mom", despite being [...] "too calm, too gorgeous, too successful" [...] to be realistic. The Daily Beast wrote, [...] "Clair Huxtable was not only the perfect mom, but also a great role model as someone who never sacrificed either her career as a high-power lawyer or her family life." [...] Praising the character for transcending both racial and generational barriers, Patrice Evans of Jezebel described Clair as [...] "the perfect professional mom". The author went on to claim that while other famous television mothers such as June Cleaver, Carol Brady and Edith Bunker have gradually suffered a loss in [...] "potency" [...] over time, Clair instead remains a relevant maternal figure every television mother created since can only aspire to be like. As a [...] "family-balancing professional African American woman", Clair has had a profound influence on The Cosby Shows viewers. According to Susan Douglas, author of The Mommy Myth: The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined All Women, Clair was [...] "the first African American mother on television ... with whom white women identified and wanted to emulate." [...] US Weekly recognized Clair as [...] "one of TV's first working mothers", while NewNowNext's Brian Juergens credits the character with making the 1980s a [...] "boom time for great sitcom moms" [...] by [...] "breaking the mold in an essential way". SheKnows contributor Cynthia Boris recognized Clair as a mother television audiences had [...] "never seen before -- a beautiful, successful, working mom who was an African American" [...] and [...] "a positive role model ... every young woman could aspire to." [...] Sharifa Daniels of Vibe concluded [...] "No other TV <b>mom</b> <b>has</b> left such of an effect on viewers as Clair Huxtable ... an exemplary example of a wife, mother, and friend" [...] in an article recognizing [...] "10 Life Lessons Clair Huxtable Taught You".|$|E
