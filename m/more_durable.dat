5|$|Silicon carbide {{is used as}} {{a support}} and {{shelving}} material in high temperature kilns such as for firing ceramics, glass fusing, or glass casting. SiC kiln shelves are considerably lighter and <b>more</b> <b>durable</b> than traditional alumina shelves.|$|E
5|$|He is {{credited}} with popularising a technical innovation in the printing of illustrations using wood. He adopted metal-engraving tools to cut hard boxwood across the grain, producing printing blocks that could be integrated with metal type, but were much <b>more</b> <b>durable</b> than traditional woodcuts. The result was high-quality illustration at a low price.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{layers of}} mudstone, {{conglomerate}} and siltstone interrupt the limestone horizontally. These layers are {{more resistant to}} attack by carbonic acid and they can therefore act as protective capstones of fins, windows and hoodoos. Many of the <b>more</b> <b>durable</b> hoodoos are capped with a type of magnesium-rich limestone called dolomite. Dolomite dissolves at a much slower rate, and consequently protects the weaker limestone underneath.|$|E

5|$|Monster CEO Noel Lee {{claims the}} average {{consumer}} {{may not be able}} to tell the difference on-screen, but that Monster's video cables have higher bandwidth, are future-proofed, are <b>more</b> <b>durable</b> and that they perform better over long distances. Many reviewers stress in turn that Monster cables are not needed for lower-resolution televisions or over short distances and that the difference in audio quality is not substantial enough.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{a larger}} {{beautification}} plan for the Midway Plaisance, Time was constructed from {{a new type of}} molded, steel-reinforced concrete that was claimed to be <b>more</b> <b>durable</b> and cheaper than alternatives. It was said to be the first of any kind of finished work of art made of concrete. Before the completion of Millennium Park in 2004, it was considered the most important installation in the Chicago Park District. Time is one of several Chicago works of art funded by Benjamin Ferguson's trust fund.|$|E
5|$|The wreck is {{steadily}} decaying, turning to oxide {{at a rate}} of 0.5â€“1 ton per day (assuming one ten-thousandth of an inch per day on all surfaces). Eventually Titanics structure will collapse, and she will be reduced to a patch of rust on the seabed, with any remaining scraps of the ship's hull mingled with her <b>more</b> <b>durable</b> fittings, like the propellers, bronze capstans, compasses and the telemotor.|$|E
30|$|The Globigerina Limestone is a softer, <b>more</b> porous, less <b>durable</b> stone. The Coralline Limestone is harder, denser {{and more}} {{resistant}} to weathering.|$|R

5|$|Titanium alloys {{are used}} in {{spectacle}} frames that are rather expensive but highly durable, long lasting, light weight, and cause no skin allergies. Many backpackers use titanium equipment, including cookware, eating utensils, lanterns, and tent stakes. Though slightly more expensive than traditional steel or aluminium alternatives, titanium products can be significantly lighter without compromising strength. Titanium horseshoes are preferred to steel by farriers because it is lighter and <b>more</b> <b>durable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Visitors {{arrive and}} leave via a bus. The entry price can be set, and loans {{can be taken}} out. The player starts with {{a limited number of}} shops, rides, and {{facilities}} available. Research must be carried out to purchase others. Research can also make rides <b>more</b> <b>durable,</b> staff more efficient, and buses larger with increased capacity. The topic of research and how much funding goes into it is determined by the player.|$|E
5|$|Because of its durability, {{titanium}} {{has become}} more popular for designer jewelry (particularly, titanium rings). Its inertness makes it {{a good choice for}} those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools. Titanium is also alloyed with gold to produce an alloy that can be marketed as 24-carat gold because the 1% of alloyed Ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark. The resulting alloy is roughly the hardness of 14-carat gold and is <b>more</b> <b>durable</b> than pure 24-carat gold.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to create an assault rifle that was <b>more</b> reliable, <b>durable,</b> and easier to maintain than the M4A1 Carbine, while also being better suited to close-quarters combat and mechanized infantry roles. As a result, they hoped that the weapon would be officially adopted by the Israel Defense Forces.|$|R

50|$|This type {{of memory}} {{was used in}} some 80286 and 80386 (80386SX) systems. It was soon {{replaced}} by SIMMs using edge connectors, which proved to be <b>more</b> economical and <b>durable.</b>|$|R
5|$|In January 2011, the USAF {{opened the}} Raptor enhancement, {{development}} and integration (REDI) contract to bidders, with a $16 billion budget. In November 2011, Lockheed Martin's upgrade contract ceiling {{was raised to}} $7.4 billion. Nearly $2 billion was allocated for structural repairs and to achieve fleet availability rate of 70.6% by 2015. However, only 63% was achieved. Some F-35 technology, such as <b>more</b> <b>durable</b> stealth coatings, have been applied to the F-22. By 2012, the update schedule had slipped seven years due to instability in requirements and funding. In 2014 the USAF moved to cut upgrade funding.|$|E
5|$|Istanbul is {{primarily}} {{known for its}} Byzantine and Ottoman architecture, but its buildings reflect the various peoples and empires that have previously ruled the city. Examples of Genoese and Roman architecture remain visible in Istanbul alongside their Ottoman counterparts. Nothing of {{the architecture of the}} classical Greek period has survived, but Roman architecture has proved to be <b>more</b> <b>durable.</b> The obelisk erected by Theodosius in the Hippodrome of Constantinople is still visible in Sultanahmet Square, and a section of the Valens Aqueduct, constructed in the late 4th century, stands relatively intact at {{the western edge of the}} Fatih district. The Column of Constantine, erected in 330 CE to mark the new Roman capital, stands not far from the Hippodrome.|$|E
5|$|Metal corsets {{for medical}} {{purposes}} {{continued to be}} used in the 18th and early 19th century, although equivalent garments made from canvas were increasingly used in their place. In 1894, A.M. Phelps of the American Orthopaedic Association recommended an aluminium corset coated with waterproof enamel for sufferers of Pott disease or curvature of the spine. Made from a cast of the patient's body, the advantages of such a garment were that aluminium was lightweight, durable, thin enough to be worn beneath clothing, and could be worn while bathing. Such corsets were still being recommended in the early 20th century as cheaper and <b>more</b> <b>durable</b> in the longer run than plaster moulds, although their initial expense was greater.|$|E
50|$|According to some {{empirical}} research by economists at this institution, expenditure-based fiscal adjustments were <b>more</b> stable and <b>durable</b> than revenue-based strategies during the 1980s in Latin American and African countries running structural adjustment programs.|$|R
5000|$|As {{examples}} of practical methods of Sufism {{which can be}} of use in the modern world, the Sirdar discusses meditation, the giving of charity, and focusing <b>more</b> on <b>durable</b> truths and realities than on transient and illusory pursuits. He also discusses the relationship between Sufism and the mind-body connection in healing. He asserts that, through Sufism, [...] "our latent forces for good can be increased, {{as well as our}} creative productivity".|$|R

5|$|Passenger staterooms {{have largely}} {{deteriorated}} {{because they were}} framed in perishable softwoods like teak and pine, leaving a warren of hanging electrical wire, light fixtures and debris interspersed with <b>more</b> <b>durable</b> items like brass bed frames, light fixtures, and marble-topped washstands. Woodwork with attachments like doorknobs, drawer-pulls or push-plates survive in better condition {{because of the small}} electric charge emitted by metal which repels fish and other harmful organisms. On the whole hardwoods like mahogany, the material for most stateroom furnishings, is more resistant to decay. Lavatories and bathrooms within the passenger quarters survive because they were framed in steel.|$|E
5|$|The micro {{format is}} the most durable {{from the point of}} view of {{designed}} insertion lifetime. The standard and mini connectors have a design lifetime of 1,500 insertion-removal cycles, the improved Mini-B connectors increased this to 5,000. The micro connectors were designed with frequent charging of portable devices in mind, so have a design life of 10,000 cycles and also place the flexible contacts, which wear out sooner, on the easily replaced cable, while the <b>more</b> <b>durable</b> rigid contacts are located in the receptacles. Likewise, the springy component of the retention mechanism, parts that provide required gripping force, were also moved into plugs on the cable side.|$|E
5|$|Traditional series {{items such}} as Bombs used for {{demolition}} and the Bow and Arrow for ranged attacks are available as Link progresses through the game, along with new additions such as a mechanical Beetle that flies to areas beyond Link's reach {{for a variety of}} actions including activating switches; and a whip for grabbing otherwise-unreachable objects and levers. Link's shield takes damage when blocking attacks fail, and may eventually break. Items and equipment can also be optionally upgraded using materials gathered from defeated monsters and within each overworld environment, making them stronger and <b>more</b> <b>durable.</b> In addition to consuming resources, Link must also pay for the upgrade with Rupees, the game's currency which is scattered throughout the world.|$|E
5000|$|As a race, {{the average}} Atlantean {{is far more}} {{powerful}} than the average [...] "human" [...] - they stand capable of speeds of swimming up to 30 mi/h km/h, breathe perfectly underwater (although cannot survive on the surface for more than five minutes), have a life-span of approximately 150 years, and are far <b>more</b> physically <b>durable</b> and strong than the average human, as a side effect of living in such a high-pressure environment.|$|R
50|$|While not routine, {{dealkalization}} {{can also}} be measured {{in a variety of}} other ways. Since dealkalized surfaces are <b>more</b> chemically <b>durable,</b> they are also more resistant to weathering reactions, and appropriate evaluation of this parameter can give indirect evidence of a previously dealkalized surface. It is also possible to evaluate dealkalization through the use of advanced, surface analytical techniques such as SIMS or XPS, which give direct measurements of glass surface composition.|$|R

5|$|Until the 12thcentury, stone-built {{and earth}} and timber castles were contemporary, {{but by the}} late 12thcentury the number of castles being built went into decline. This has been partly {{attributed}} to the higher cost of stone-built fortifications, and the obsolescence of timber and earthwork sites, which meant it was preferable to build in <b>more</b> <b>durable</b> stone. Although superseded by their stone successors, timber and earthwork castles {{were by no means}} useless. This is evidenced by the continual maintenance of timber castles over long periods, sometimes several centuries; Owain GlyndÅµr's 11th-century timber castle at Sycharth was still in use by the start of the 15thcentury, its structure having been maintained for four centuries.|$|E
5|$|All runways {{have been}} resurfaced with concrete, a <b>more</b> <b>durable</b> {{material}} {{than the previous}} asphalt. In April 2016, 8L/26R became the last runway to be resurfaced. This runway is also the longest at McCarran and typically serves one-third of the airport's annual traffic. Parallel to it is runway 8R/26L, which opened in 1991. On {{the western side of}} the airport are runways 1L/19R and 1R/19L. 1L/19R was originally a short runway suited for light aircraft before it was significantly widened and lengthened in 1997. Between the two sets of parallel runways was runway 14/32, which has been decommissioned. Runways 8L/26R and 8R/26L were previously 7L/25R and 7R/25L respectively. The runways were renumbered 8L/26R and 8R/26L in August 2017, following a geographical shift in the planet's magnetic poles by more than 3 degrees, the threshold for renumbering set by the FAA.|$|E
5|$|Although the Annapolis Convention {{saw only}} about a dozen delegates attend, {{representing}} only five states, it called for a meeting {{to be held in}} Philadelphia in May 1787, to devise amendments to the Articles of Confederation which would result in a <b>more</b> <b>durable</b> constitutional arrangement. Accordingly, in December 1786, the Virginia General Assembly elected seven men as the commonwealth's delegation: Washington, Mason, Henry, Randolph, Madison, Wythe, and John Blair. Henry declined appointment, and his place was given to Dr. James McClurg. Randolph, who had just been elected governor, sent three notifications of election to Mason, who accepted without any quibbles. The roads were difficult because of spring flooding, and Mason was the last Virginia delegate to arrive, on May 17, three days after the convention's scheduled opening. But it was not until May 25 that the convention formally opened, with the arrival of at least one delegate from ten of the twelve states which sent representatives (Rhode Island sent no one).|$|E

50|$|The North Carolina State University's College of Veterinary Medicine in Raleigh, North Carolina uses both PC (plastic coating) and PN (plastination) to {{investigate}} and compare {{the difference in the}} two methods. The PC method was simple and inexpensive, but the plastinated specimens (PN method) were <b>more</b> flexible, <b>durable,</b> and lifelike than those preserved by the PC method. The use of plastination allowed the use of many body parts such as muscle, nerves, bones, ligaments, and central nervous system to be preserved.|$|R
