2500|$|Oligopoly is a <b>market</b> <b>form</b> {{in which}} a market or {{industry}} is dominated by {{a small number of}} sellers. The oldest model was the duopoly of Cournot (1838). It was criticized by Harold Hotelling for its instability, by Joseph Bertrand for lacking equilibrium for prices as independent variables. Hotelling built a model of market located over a line with two sellers in each extreme of the line, in this case maximizing profit for both sellers leads to a stable equilibrium. From this model also follows that if a seller is to choose the location of his store so as to maximize his profit, he will place his store the closest to his competitor: [...] "the sharper competition with his rival is offset by the greater number of buyers he has an advantage". He also argues that clustering of stores is wasteful {{from the point of view}} of transportation costs and that public interest would dictate more spatial dispersion.|$|E

50|$|An {{oligopoly}} is a <b>market</b> <b>form</b> {{in which}} a market or industry is dominated by {{a small number of}} sellers (oligopolists).

50|$|Market {{power is}} a company’s ability to {{increase}} prices without losing all its customers. Any company that has market power can engage in price discrimination.

5000|$|Oligopoly is {{a common}} <b>market</b> <b>form</b> where a number of firms are in competition. As a {{quantitative}} description of oligopoly, the four-firm concentration ratio is often utilized. This measure expresses, as a percentage, the market share of the four largest firms in any particular industry. For example, as of fourth quarter 2008, if we combine total market share of Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile...we see that these firms, together, control 97% of the U.S. cellular telephone market.|$|E

5000|$|An {{oligopsony}} (from Ancient Greek ὀλίγοι (oligoi) [...] "few" [...] + ὀψωνία (opsōnia) [...] "purchase") is a <b>market</b> <b>form</b> {{in which}} the number of buyers is small {{while the number of}} sellers in theory could be large. This typically happens in a market for inputs where numerous suppliers are competing to sell their product to a small number of (often large and powerful) buyers. It contrasts with an oligopoly, where there are many buyers but few sellers. An oligopsony is a form of imperfect competition. The terms monopoly (one seller), monopsony (one buyer), and bilateral monopoly have a similar relationship.|$|E
50|$|The {{alpha profile}} of an order is the {{expected}} impact-free price conditioned {{on the order}} {{and the state of}} the <b>market,</b> <b>form</b> the decision time to the required completion time. In other words, it is the price that one expects for the security would have over the execution horizon if the order were not executed. To estimate the cost of an execution strategy, market impact must be added to the impact-free price. It is well worth stressing that attempts to estimate the cost of alternative schedules without impact adjustments are counter-productive: high urgency strategies would capture more liquidity near the decision time and therefore would always be preferred if one did not account for their impact. In fact, front-loaded execution schedules have a higher average impact cost.|$|E

5000|$|The economistic fallacy is {{a concept}} {{originated}} by Karl Polanyi in the 1950s, that refers to fallacious conflation of human economy in general, with its <b>market</b> <b>form.</b> Whereas the former is a necessary component of any society, being the organization through which that society meets its physical wants, ie. reproduces itself, {{the latter is a}} modern institution that is neither autonomous nor stable. The fallacy can occur either by narrowing the genus [...] "economic" [...] to merely market phenomena, or overextending [...] "the market" [...] to encompass all aspects of human economic activity. These moves can be seen as equating the conceptual content of [...] "economics" [...] with what is in fact mere form or ideology, instead of with the substance embodied by the specific decisive relations in which humans are engaged in any given period and locale.|$|E

40|$|We use a socio-historical lens {{to look at}} how Community Supported Agriculture {{programs}} (CSAs) {{have gained}} legitimacy as a <b>market</b> <b>form.</b> In this article, we question the countercultural conception of CSAs, especially given their rapid growth over the past 25 years. We contend that placing CSA within a larger frame of reference that incorporates American pastoral values and connects CSA to the history of American pastoralism helps account for how CSA has gained legitimacy with mainstream users. We show that American pastoralism provides a link between 19 th century agrarian ideals, 1950 s suburbia, 1970 s counter-cultural communards, and today’s CSAs. In showing the ubiquity and chameleon like character of American pastoralist ideology, we suggest that it is an important example of a cultural imaginary, which is inducing change in food markets in the United States {{and at the same time}} masking certain cultural contradictions. We propose that the development of the Internet as a channel of communication has aided in building legitimacy for this <b>market</b> <b>form</b> by promoting both more personal commercial communications and the possibility of de-massification of communications. Thus, CSAs’ web presence reinforces egalitarian principles and the perception of shared community that are central ingredients of pastoralist ideology...|$|E

30|$|Levi (1988) {{states that}} the level of {{government}} extraction capacity is restrained by three conditions: the capacity of the government to control social resources and relative bargaining power; the capacity of the government to formulate, coordinate, and execute extraction contacts; and finally, the governmental expectations for the future, in other words, the withdrawal rate. In short, governments are expected to extract resources from their subjects without annoying them (Tirole 1994). Kiser (1994) explores two types of tax structures—a hierarchical form employing salaried state officials and a <b>market</b> <b>form</b> (tax farming). These frameworks of extraction have triggered controversy.|$|E
