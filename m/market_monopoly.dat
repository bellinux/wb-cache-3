6000|$|But, the British laborer's {{policy of}} [...] "ca' canny," [...] {{which is the}} very honorable one of giving least for most, and which is {{likewise}} {{the policy of the}} English capitalist, is nevertheless frowned upon by the English capitalist, whose business existence is threatened by the great American scab. From the rise of the factory system, the English capitalist gladly embraced the opportunity, wherever he found it, of giving least for most. He did it all over the world whenever he enjoyed a <b>market</b> <b>monopoly,</b> and he did it at home with the laborers employed in his mills, destroying them like flies till prevented, within limits, by the passage of the Factory Acts. Some of the proudest fortunes of England today may trace their origin to the giving of least for most to the miserable slaves of the factory towns. But at the present time the English capitalist is outraged because his laborers are employing against him precisely the same policy he employed against them, and which he would employ again did the chance present itself.|$|E

To utilize internet resources and abide from <b>market</b> <b>monopolies</b> open source distance learning management systems are addressing the technical factors in providing perfect solution for educational sector. Higher Education institution face challenges to make suitable selection which best fit to their requirements, as well examining the effectiveness and evaluation of open source LMS’s are a complex issue. In our study the main objective is to overcome the difficulties by comparing best available Open Source (OSC) LMS’s and recommend a modern open source distance learning system considering enhancement in technology, recent trends, quality assurance of instructional process and it’s outputs according to targeted goals, as well educational sector can customize, enhance functionalities and redistribute it. In this study literature is reviewed and as per our finding not much research has been already conducted about comparison of open source software in distance learning. This paper compared and analysed different open source distance learning systems and extract the some important recommendations and conclusions...|$|R

50|$|It is {{important}} to note that due to the often ambiguous nature of cost in production, it may be relatively easy for a firm to avoid legal difficulties when undertaking such action. Due to this ambiguous nature, limit pricing may well be a commonly used strategy even in modern economies. However, it is often very hard to regulate, since limit pricing is often synonymous with a <b>market</b> <b>monopoly.</b> When a monopoly exists, it becomes very difficult to compare alternative prices with other, similar firms to confirm claims that limit pricing may be occurring.|$|E

50|$|Market {{power is}} the ability to affect the terms and {{conditions}} of exchange so that the price of a product is set by a single company (price is not imposed by the market as in perfect competition). Although a <b>monopoly's</b> <b>market</b> power is great it is still limited by the demand side of the <b>market.</b> A <b>monopoly</b> has a negatively sloped demand curve, not a perfectly inelastic curve. Consequently, any price increase will result in the loss of some customers.|$|R
50|$|Critics {{argue that}} {{capitalism}} {{is associated with}} the unfair distribution of wealth and power; a tendency toward <b>market</b> <b>monopoly</b> or oligopoly (and government by oligarchy); imperialism, counter-revolutionary wars and various forms of economic and cultural exploitation; repression of workers and trade unionists, and phenomena such as social alienation, economic inequality, unemployment, and economic instability. Critics have argued that there is an inherent tendency toward oligopolistic structures when laissez-faire is combined with capitalist private property. Capitalism is regarded by many socialists to be irrational in that production and the direction of the economy are unplanned, creating many inconsistencies and internal contradictions and thus should be controlled through public policy.|$|E

50|$|People {{and governments}} in {{developing}} countries have far fewer financial resources to bear high monopoly prices and drug prices even for patent-protected medicines in these countries are often considerably lower. Profits are often insubstantial and do not proportionally cover development costs. In many cases, a patent holder will license generic manufacturers to sell to low-income countries at low cost. India has less restrictive patent regimes which make the manufacture of generic medications possible sooner, for sale domestically or in other countries where the patent protections do not apply. Typically the cost of making small-molecule drugs is {{only a very small}} portion of a developed-country <b>market</b> <b>monopoly</b> price, which makes generic manufacturing very cheap. In contrast, some drugs are inherently expensive to produce, such as the biopharmaceutical drug Cerezyme, typically costing $200,000 per year in the United States.|$|E

5000|$|Ewing was the Commissioner of Patents from 15 August 1913 to 15 August 1917. [...] When he began, he {{kept the}} {{tradition}} of <b>market</b> <b>monopoly</b> on the control of patents by declaring that “a man {{had the right to}} say what the resale price of his patent should be”. [...] A strong supporter of patent reform, he worked for ways of streamlining and expediting patent operations. He often complained about the case backlogs, cramped offices and low salaries of the examiners {{and other members of the}} U.S. Patent Office. [...] He tried to get a reform bill through the Congress in 1915 but it failed. [...] However, he did have the Patent Office regulations revised for “brevity, speed and efficiency”. [...] He still ran into more problems when World War I began. Many of the workers left the Patent Corps to go “Over There” to France with the Army and Navy Corps. The war also complicated the conditions for the patent applications on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, forcing Ewing to declare that the United States would not take over the patents from the citizens of enemy nations. But he drew criticism, and this situation would not be resolved until 1921, when the Nolan Bill was passed by the Congress. [...] Nevertheless, in spite of the difficulties, under Ewing’s administration, two agencies were created. One of them was the Patent Office Society, formed in 1917 “to promote and foster a true appreciation of the American Patent System”. [...] The other was the National Research Council (NRC), organized in 1916 to oversee the scientific and technical services for the war effort. The NRC was asked by Ewing to assemble a committee specifically to prepare the legislation to reform the patent laws. It eventually succeeded in having the Lampert Patent Office Bill passed by the Congress - in 1922, five years after the end of Ewing’s term.|$|E
50|$|Baxter's law can be {{illustrated}} under {{the context of}} Internet market before the broadband age. As mentioned above, when the market for platform is subject to price and rate regulation, a monopoly of network provider holds strong incentives to monopolize an unregulated applications market (a downstream level market). For example, because the FCC have capped the price that telephone companies could charge consumers by using the telephone network circuit for Internet access, those companies are unable to extract monopoly profits from the platform. In other words, they are prohibited to increase charges and prices for the exclusive services which they provide in the market. As a result, these monopoly extend their business and service to unregulated markets. Comparing to rivals in these <b>market,</b> <b>monopolies</b> could offer lower, cost-based rates for the same service because of vertically integration. Therefore, the revenues earned in unregulated market can offset the loss due to regulation in <b>monopoly</b> <b>market</b> and increase overall profits.|$|R
