Preferment, like other house <b>matters,</b> <b>is</b> decided on democratically by house members. However, faculty members of the house cannot vote. Telluride House members also {{contribute}} to the Association's work, through reading and evaluating applications for Telluride programs, such as the Telluride Association Summer Program.|$|E
5|$|To be able {{to choose}} the more {{appropriate}} algorithm for each specific problem, it is important to determine both the effectiveness and precision of all the available algorithms. The domain studying these <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> called numerical linear algebra. As with other numerical situations, two main aspects are the complexity of algorithms and their numerical stability.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} the concept of <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> a {{history of the}} {{fundamental}} length scales used to define matter. Different building blocks apply depending upon whether one defines matter on an atomic or elementary particle level. One may use a definition that <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> atoms, or that <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> hadrons, or that <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> leptons and quarks depending upon the scale at which one wishes to define matter.|$|R

5|$|For example, a bike in a 10m (33ft) radius {{steady-state}} turn at 10m/s (36km/h, 22mph) {{must be at}} {{an angle}} of 45.6°. A rider can lean {{with respect to the}} bike in order to keep either the torso or the bike more or less upright if desired. The angle that <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> the one between the horizontal plane and the plane defined by the tire contacts and the location of the center of mass of bike and rider.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to consider matrices with infinitely many rows and/or columns even if, being infinite objects, one cannot write down such matrices explicitly. All that <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> that for every element in the set indexing rows, and every element in the set indexing columns, there is a well-defined entry (these index sets need not even be subsets of the natural numbers). The basic operations of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations to define the resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.|$|E
5|$|Michael Weyland's {{ambiguous}} {{humanity is}} a subject of debate for viewers and critics, and speculation exists {{that he is an}} android more sophisticated than Bishop. In Cinema of Simulation: Hyperreal Hollywood in the Long 1990s, Randy Laist interprets this ambiguity as indicative of a theme of the Alien franchise: what <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> a character's actions, not its species. Michael Weyland is a duplicitous character, and it is irrelevant whether he is a human or an android.|$|E

5000|$|According to an August 2015 poll, 78% {{of likely}} American voters {{said that the}} {{statement}} All Lives <b>Matter</b> <b>was</b> [...] "closer to their own" [...] point of view than Black Lives <b>Matter</b> <b>was.</b> Only 11% said that the statement Black Lives <b>Matter</b> <b>was</b> closer. Nine percent said that neither statement reflected their own point of view.|$|R
5000|$|In physics, exotic <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>matter</b> {{that somehow}} {{deviates}} from normal matter and has [...] "exotic" [...] properties. A more broad definition of exotic <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> {{any kind of}} non-baryonic matter—that is not made of baryons, the subatomic particles, such as protons and neutrons, of which ordinary <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> composed. Exotic mass has been considered a colloquial term for matters such as dark matter, negative mass, or complex mass.|$|R
5|$|Tham Chee Ho contends that, {{based on}} the {{objective}} test set out in Chng Suan Tze, the fear that the courts will take over responsibility for national security <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> misplaced. This is because the courts do not review the actions taken by the executive for national security purposes, but merely determine whether the situation in fact involves national security issues. The Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze reflected this by holding that what was required to preserve national security was a matter solely for executive judgment.|$|E
5|$|The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Belarus is {{the highest}} court in Belarus. While other courts deal with civil or {{criminal}} issues, the Constitutional Court deals with matters involving the Constitution and the legality of certain laws passed by the government. The court {{has the power to}} declare any law unconstitutional. From April until May 2007, the Constitutional Court reviewed 101 laws and decrees; they were deemed to be constitutional. The court that deals with criminal law <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> the Supreme Court of Belarus.|$|E
5|$|There {{has long}} been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and {{intelligence}} {{can be attributed to}} heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and nurture controversy. Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does. In some respects, all that <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> {{the presence or absence of}} experience during critical periods of development. In other respects, the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.|$|E

50|$|Strange <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> a {{particular}} form of quark matter, usually {{thought of as a}} liquid of up, down, and strange quarks. It is contrasted with nuclear <b>matter,</b> which <b>is</b> a liquid of neutrons and protons (which themselves are built out of up and down quarks), and with non-strange quark <b>matter,</b> which <b>is</b> a quark liquid that contains only up and down quarks. At high enough density, strange <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> expected to be color superconducting. Strange <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> hypothesized to occur in the core of neutron stars, or, more speculatively, as isolated droplets that may vary in size from femtometers (strangelets) to kilometers (quark stars).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe chiral nucleon-meson model, {{previously}} {{applied to}} systems with {{equal number of}} neutrons and protons, is extended to asymmetric nuclear <b>matter.</b> Fluctuations <b>are</b> included {{in the framework of}} the functional renormalization group. The equation of state for pure neutron <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> studied and compared to recent advanced many-body calculations. The chiral condensate in neutron <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> computed as a function of baryon density. It is found that, once fluctuations are incorporated, the chiral restoration transition for pure neutron <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> shifted to high densities, much beyond three times the density of normal nuclear matter...|$|R

This shows that concerning religious <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> more important than worldly matters for mankind.|$|E
25|$|A graph drawing {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the graph itself (the abstract, non-visual structure) as there are several ways to structure the graph drawing. All that <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> which vertices are connected to which others by how many edges and not the exact layout. In practice, it is often difficult to decide if two drawings represent the same graph. Depending on the problem domain some layouts may be better suited and easier to understand than others.|$|E
50|$|As seen in {{the above}} discussion, many early {{definitions}} of what can <b>be</b> called ordinary <b>matter</b> <b>were</b> based upon its structure or building blocks. On the scale of elementary particles, a definition that follows this tradition can be stated as: ordinary <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> everything that is composed of quarks and leptons, or ordinary <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> everything that is composed of any elementary fermions except antiquarks and antileptons. The connection between these formulations follows.|$|R
50|$|Programmable <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>matter</b> {{which has}} the ability to change its {{physical}} properties (shape, density, moduli, conductivity, optical properties, etc.) in a programmable fashion, based upon user input or autonomous sensing.
