5|$|The Altar to Liberty: <b>Minerva</b> monument: The {{battle is}} commemorated with a monument, which {{includes}} a bronze statue of <b>Minerva</b> {{near the top of}} Battle Hill, the highest point of Brooklyn, in Green-Wood Cemetery. The statue was sculpted by Frederick Ruckstull and unveiled in 1920. The statue stands in the northwest corner of the cemetery and gazes directly at the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. In 2006, the <b>Minerva</b> statue was invoked in a successful defense to prevent a building from blocking the line of sight from the cemetery to the Statue of Liberty in the harbor. The annual Battle of Long Island commemoration begins inside the main Gothic arch entrance to Green-Wood Cemetery and marches up Battle Hill to ceremonies at the monument.|$|E

5|$|The {{paintings}} on the back wall are recognized as representing <b>Minerva</b> Punishing Arachne and Apollo's Victory Over Marsyas. Both stories involve <b>Minerva,</b> the Goddess of Wisdom and patron of the arts. These two legends are both stories of mortals challenging gods and the dreadful consequences. One scholar {{points out that the}} legend dealing with two women, <b>Minerva</b> and Arachne, is {{on the same side of}} the mirror as the queen's reflection while the male legend is on the side of the king.|$|E
5|$|As a {{token of}} respect for Roman religion, however, Elagabalus joined either Astarte, <b>Minerva,</b> Urania, or some {{combination}} of the three to Elagabal as consort. A union between Elagabal and a traditional goddess would have served to strengthen ties between the new religion and the imperial cult. In fact, there may have been an effort to introduce Elagabal, Urania, and Athena as the new Capitoline triad of Rome—replacing Jupiter, Juno, and <b>Minerva.</b>|$|E

5|$|NY28N is {{classified}} as a rural major collector road, {{with the exception of}} the section that is overlapped with Route30, which {{is classified}} as a rural minor arterial road. As of 2006, the Route30 overlap had an annual average daily traffic of 1,781 vehicles. Traffic volumes are reduced to 1,231 vehicles per day from the end of the Route30 overlap to the intersection with Blue Ridge Road (CR84). South of this intersection, traffic is reduced further to 350 until the hamlet of <b>Minerva,</b> rising to 751 south of <b>Minerva</b> until near the Warren county line.

5|$|The Roman {{fortress}} of Deva was constructed from local sandstone, which was quarried {{across the river}} {{to the south of}} the fortress. Traces of the quarry are visible in Handbridge. In the 2nd century, a shrine to the Roman goddess <b>Minerva</b> was carved in the quarry for protection, perhaps by the quarry workers. Despite heavy weathering, the figure can be seen holding a spear and a shield with an owl above the left shoulder to symbolise wisdom. There is also a carving of an altar where offerings were left. The only rock-cut Roman shrine still in situ in Britain, the <b>Minerva</b> shrine is a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|The {{athletics}} venue suffered with drainage problems, {{and from}} the 1970s {{it was no longer}} used for competitions. This forced <b>Minerva</b> IS to hold many of its trainings at Stovner stadion in Oslo and Jessheim stadion in Ullensaker. In 1976, <b>Minerva</b> IS took initiative to lay all-weather running track, but the proposal was rejected by the municipality. In 1990, Skedsmo Municipal Council initially voted to allocate NOK2 million for all-weather running track, but the funding was reallocated to fix a leaking roof on Skedsmo Church. No further grants were issued for the stadium.|$|E

5|$|Foreign {{religions}} were tolerated {{insofar as}} they did not interfere with public order, or could be assimilated with the traditional Roman religion. The worship of Egyptian deities in particular flourished under the Flavian dynasty, to an extent not seen again until the reign of Commodus.

5|$|Hamelin {{had used}} the British preoccupation with Île Bonaparte to send {{additional}} frigates to sea during 1809 and early 1810, including his flagship Vénus, which captured three East Indiamen at the Action of 18 November 1809, and Bellone, which took the Portuguese frigate <b>Minerva</b> in the Bay of Bengal a few days later. <b>Minerva,</b> renamed Minerve in French hands, was subsequently involved in the Action of 3 July 1810, when a further two East Indiamen were captured. The squadron in this action was commanded by Guy-Victor Duperré in Bellone, whose ships were so badly damaged that Duperré was forced to spend nearly a month repairing his vessels in the Comoros Islands before {{they were ready to}} return to Isle de France.|$|E

5|$|Italy had {{declared}} neutrality {{at the start}} of World War I, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the threat from Austro-Hungarian submarines and naval mines in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. <b>Minerva</b> was initially used to lay a series of defensive minefields, along with her sister Partenope and the cruiser , in support of this strategy. <b>Minerva</b> survived the war and was discarded in May 1921, the last surviving member of her class. She was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{earliest}} roads in the area crossed through <b>Minerva.</b> The first known road that reached the settlement was established in 1804, when land along a highway from St. Lawrence County {{to the town of}} Chester in Warren County was populated by the West family. <b>Minerva</b> was mainly limited to the vicinity of the old highway, but as more people settled along the road, the town began to grow. For a time, the town boasted several water-powered sawmills, and the highway was used to transport lumber. However, the lumber industry began to fail, and by 1840, the logging and lumber system had been replaced by crops. The town initiated river drives, which continued until 1950.|$|E
