[...] "With all that said, I think {{the most important part of}} the Maranatha is not so much their sound, but the lyrical tension between the injustice of this world and finding peace with in it. It’s a constant push and pull against black and white, depravity and morality, and the hypocrisy of those who claim to know the way and preach a message of love out of one side of their mouths and a doctrine of ignorance and sometimes pure hate out of the other.
