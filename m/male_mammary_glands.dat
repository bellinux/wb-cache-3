30|$|Mammary glands {{are derived}} from the ectoderm. Their lumens create mammary ducts during the {{formation}} and branching of mammary anlagen from the mammary ridge. Initially, the breasts are undeveloped in men and women, {{and there are no}} sex differences until puberty. During and after puberty, estrogen causes the mammary ducts in women to grow and lengthen, and estrogen and progesterone promote differentiation of the lobes and acinus. This occurs in the presence of substances such as growth hormones, prolactin, and insulin. However, <b>male</b> <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> never develop. Only a few mammary ducts are found below the nipple, and there is generally no lobular structure. Gynecomastia also reflects the normal, lobeless structure; thus, in histopathological findings, a proliferation of ductal epithelium and stromal tissue is characteristic, but a lobular structure is usually not found. However, lobular formation can be observed in <b>male</b> <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> due to extraneous hormone administration or other causes. An extensive search for autopsy cases showed that of 65 gynecomastia cases, 28 had prostate cancer with a history of estrogen administration as a part of hormone therapy. Of these, 8 cases (29 %) exhibited definite acinus formation, and of those, 2 showed secretory changes that resembled the lactation period in women (Schwartz and Wilens 1963). These two cases had no history of taking progesterone. However, lactation period-like changes to the mammary glands have been reported in a case of sex reversal from male to female (Kanhai et al. 2000). This patient underwent hormone therapy, which consisted of progesterone for chemical castration combined with estrogen for feminization.|$|E
40|$|Genistein (GE) is a {{prevalent}} phytoestrogen {{whose presence}} in {{human and animal}} foods may affect biological actions of synthetic endocrine active compounds.

The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chicken embryos was used in an assay for this response, and normal mammary glands and various mammary growths from GR mice, including plaques, hyperplasic alveolar nodules, and hormone-dependent and hormone-independent tumors were tested. Fifteen percent of the <b>male</b> <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> tested were positive, as were 28 % of the resting female mammary glands. Fifty percent of the plaques and 63 % of the hyperplastic alveolar nodules tested induced neovascularization.

A fine-structural study revealed that capillaries invaded to within less than 0. 5 microns of the tumor cells, but no penetration of tumor cells through the basal lamina was observed.

30|$|Since {{this disease}} is {{commonly}} found in premenopausal women, postmenopausal women undergoing hormone therapy, patients {{with a history of}} taking oral contraceptives (Ferreira et al. 2008), and often in men with gynecomastia, its cause is thought to be related to hormone imbalances. Specifically, an abnormal myofibroblast response to hormones is considered important. However, gynecomastia is the enlargement of <b>male</b> <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> in response to estrogen (Braunstein 1993). It is caused by a hormone imbalance involving a surplus of estrogen compared to androgen. Gynecomastia occurs in diseases that involve elevated serum estrogen levels, such as estrogen-producing tumors and cirrhosis, which lead to estrogen metabolism disorders and promotion of the production of aromatase due to various reasons. It can also occur in states of relatively high estrogen levels during anti-androgen therapy for prostate cancer (Kumar et al. 2005). Braunstein reported that 25 % of gynecomastia cases are idiopathic, 25 % are puberty, 10 – 20 % are drug-induced, 8 % are due to cirrhosis or malnutrition, 8 % accompany primary hypogonadism, 3 % occur with testicular tumors, 2 % have secondary hypogonadism, 1.5 % have hyperthyroidism, and 1 % have renal disease (Braunstein 1993). Nagel et al. (1973) reported gynecomastia in 58 % of chronic renal failure and dialysis patients, while Vircburger et al. (1985) reported 42 %, which are high rates.|$|E
40|$|The <b>male</b> <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> often undergo {{hyperplasia}} in {{the presence}} of tumors associated with a high urinary excretion of chorionic gonadotropin. Included in this group are the chorioepitheliomas, both testiculari' 3 and extragenital," " and, more rarely, teratomas" ' and seminomas"" ' of the testis. Although the histological and clinical features differ in each of these tumors, {{there is reason to believe}} that all contain chorionic elements when accompanied by chorionic gonadotropin in the urine. " 2 Less commonly gynecomastia occurs in association with non-choriogenic tumors of the testis. These comprise a heterogeneous group with respect to their hormonal excretion patterns, but in general fall into one of two categories: (i) those in which the gynecomastia is probably a non-specific effect related to loss of testicular tissue by tumor invasion, radiation therapy, or surgical extirpation, ' and in which the excretion of androgen is low and of follicle-stimulating gonadotropic hormone (FSH) high, ' and (ii) those in which the gynecomastia appears to be more directly related to hormonal stimulation by the tumor itself, as in Sertoli-cell' 0 and aberrant adrenocortical' 1 tumors. In these the excretion of estrogen is increased, and since removal of the tumor results in both a reduction in urinary estrogen and a regression in the gynecomastia, it is highly probable that the tumor is the source of the estrogen and that the latter is an important factor in stimulating mammary growth. Gynecomastia has also been reported as a rare complication in interstitial- or Leydig-cell tumors," ' but the histological diagnosis in such cases has been questioned. ' As a rule these tumors produce virilization in children, but exert no hormonal effects in adults. 3 ' On the basis of a study of dog tumors, Huggins and Moulder ' have presented evidence to show that those testicular tumors associated with gynecomastia and previously reported as interstitial-cell tumors were probably incorrectly interpreted examples of Sertoli-cell tumors. However, in one of these cases, that of Hunt and Budd, " the possibility of chorionic elements in the tumor does not appear to have been completely excluded, since the urine containe...|$|E
40|$|MALIGNANT tumours of the <b>male</b> <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> are {{relatively}} rare. Men account only for about 1 per cent {{of breast cancer}} materials (Moss, 1965). Approximately 10 per cent of all tumours encountered in the male breast are malignant (Jaaskelainen, 1951). The percentage {{of men in the}} Egyptian breast cancer series reported by El-Gazayerli and Abdel-Aziz in 1963 was as high as 6. 4, while in a Finnish material it was 0. 3 (Peltokallio et al., 1969).

Breast carcinoma represents {{only a small part of}} tumours among the male population with an incidence of approximately 44 new patients per year, which is less than 1 % (exactly 0. 13 %) of malign tumours. Mammography of male patients is usually performed in the basic standard projections ? mediolateral and craniocaudal. Generally it is possible to perform other projections (but this is very rare) ? lateral and caudocranial. The mediolateral ? transversal ? projection is usually satisfactory in male patients.

40|$|In females, {{progesterone}} {{is associated}} with reproductive functions. In males, its role and the expression of its genomic receptor are not very well understood. In attempts to achieve a hormonal male contraceptive method, gestagens are used to downregulate gonadotropin and sperm production. It is therefore essential to understand the mechanism of action of progesterone {{at the molecular level}} in males, especially in primates. This investigation was undertaken: (a) to determine whether the genomic progesterone receptor is expressed in males; and (b) to locate it in various organs that are potential targets of gestagens. Human tissues were obtained at surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer and at autopsy. Non-human primate tissues were obtained at autopsy. This study was performed by analyzing the genomic progesterone receptor by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RT-PCR. The nuclear progesterone receptor was expressed in pituitary and hypothalamus of both monkeys and men.

40|$|Summary. -Mammary tumours were induced in 3 {{groups of}} male Long-Evans rats {{by a series}} of 6 {{fortnightly}} gastric intubations of 7, 12 -dimethylbenzanthracene. Two weeks before the initial carcinogen treatment one group of rats was grafted with 3 pituitary homografts underneath the kidney capsule of each recipient (hyper-prolactinaemia). A second group, 2 weeks before the initial carcinogen treatment and {{for the duration of the}} study (35 weeks), were injected 4 x weekly with 2 -Br-oa-ergocryptine (CB- 154) (hypoprolactinaemia). A third group of rats served as controls. A significant increase in the incidence of mammary tumours and a reduced latency period of tumour appearance in the hyperprolactinaemia group, when compared with the controls, were observed in this study. Mammary tumour incidence and latency period of tumour appearance in the hypoprolactinaemia group, however, did not differ significantly from controls.

40|$|Abstract. Sexual {{dimorphism}} is a routinely encountered but previously unreported {{feature of}} the normal rat <b>mammary</b> <b>gland.</b> Forty <b>male</b> and 40 female F 344 rats, 19 weeks of age, were examined retrospectively to document histologic differences that are very apparent when <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> of <b>males</b> and females {{of the same age}} are compared. Development of the <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> starts in utero, and there is reported to be little morphologic difference between males and females at birth. By 19 weeks of age, however, the differences are very noticeable. The <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> of females, comprised of scattered tubular ducts and alveolar structures that have distinct lumina lined, usually, by a single layer of cuboidal epithelium, are characterized as tubuloalveolar. In young <b>males,</b> <b>mammary</b> tissue is generally more florid than in females of the same age. There are, scattered within the hypodermis, larger, more contiguous, lobular groups ofcells that are distinct for their lack of obvious tubular or ductal orientation. The cells, arranged into alveoli, are generally characterized by abundant, foamy, eosin-ophilic cytoplasm containing distinct, variably-sized vacuoles. Alveolar lumina are mostly indistinct but may contain evidence of secretory activity.

For example, {{it is thought that}} the <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> is a transformed sweat gland, more closely related to apocrine sweat <b>glands.</b> Because <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> do not fossilize well, supporting such theories with fossil evidence is difficult. Many of the current theories are based on comparisons between lines of living mammals—monotremes, marsupials, and eutherians. One theory proposes that <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> evolved from glands that were used to keep the eggs of early mammals moist and free from infection (monotremes still lay eggs). Other theories suggest that early secretions were used directly by hatched young, or that the secretions were used by young to help them orient to their mothers.|$|R
40|$|The present {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} determine the roles of estrogen receptors a and b (ERa and ERb) in normal and neoplastic development in the mouse <b>mammary</b> <b>gland.</b> In wild-type mice, in vivo administration of estradiol (E) + progesterone (P) stimulated mammary ductal growth and alveolar differentiation. <b>Mammary</b> <b>glands</b> from mice in which the ERb gene has been deleted (bERKO mice) demonstrated normal ductal growth and differentiation in response to E + P. By contrast, <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> from mice in which the ERa gene has been deleted (aERKO mice) demonstrated only rudimentary ductal structures that did not differentiate in response to E + P. EGF demonstrates estrogen-like activity in the <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> of aERKO mice: treatment of aERKO mice with EGF + P (without E) supported normal <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> development, induced expression of progesterone receptor (PR), and increased levels of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR 30) protein. <b>Mammary</b> <b>gland</b> development in bERKO mice treated with EGF + P was {{comparable to that of}} wild-type mice receiving EGF + P; EGF had no statistically significant effects on the induction of PR or expression of GPR 30 in <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> harvested from either wild-type mice or bERKO mice. In vitro exposure of <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> to 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) induced preneoplastic mammary alveolar lesions (MAL) in glands from wild-type mice and bERKO mice, but failed to induce MAL in <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> from aERKO mice. Microarray analysis of DMBA-treated <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> identified 28 functional pathways whose expression was significantly different in aERKO mice versus bot...|$|R

Many sources assert that <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> are modified sweat glands. Some authors dispute that and argue instead that they are sebaceous glands.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the distribution of fatty acids and cholesterol in total tumor and mammary tissues. Fatty acid profiles of phospholipid fractions from tumors and <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> were also determined. Fatty acids and cholesterols were analyzed by gas liquid chromatography. Methodology was developed for phospholipid separation by high performance liquid chromatography. Tumors derived from <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> in Strain A/ST mice were found to contain two to three times the amount of cholesterol compared to normal <b>mammary</b> <b>glands.</b> <b>Mammary</b> <b>glands</b> from safflower fed mice contained significantly higher percentages of linoleic acid. Linoleic acid content in stearicacid (SA- 1) fed mice was sharply reduced. linoleic acid in <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> of animals fed a high fat Stearic acid (SA- 4), corn oil and stock diet fed animals displayed similar fatty acid profiles. Fatty acid analysis of tumors excised from mice fed the experimental diets showed similar patterns in comparison to normal <b>mammary</b> <b>glands.</b> The similar distributions were in the 18 carbon fatty acids. Distributions of phospholipid fatty acids in tumors and <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> were similar. <b>Mammary</b> <b>gland</b> phospholipids displayed increased percentages of short chain (14 carbons and under) fatty acids. Results of these studies demonstrate an increased availability of diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Thesis (M. S. ...|$|R
