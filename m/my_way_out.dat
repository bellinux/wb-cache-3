25|$|I am {{forced to}} the appalling {{conclusion}} that I {{would never have}} become a writer but for Joan's death, and to a realization {{of the extent to}} which this event has motivated and formulated my writing. I live with the constant threat of possession, and a constant need to escape from possession, from control. So the death of Joan brought me in contact with the invader, the Ugly Spirit, and maneuvered me into a life long struggle, in which I have had no choice except to write <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out.</b> The 25th anniversary edition of Queer published in 2010, edited by Oliver Harris, called into question Burroughs's claim, and clarified the importance for Queer of Burroughs's traumatic relationship with the boyfriend fictionalized in the story as Eugene Allerton, rather than the shooting of Vollmer.|$|E

60|$|She shrank {{back like}} a person struck, her face flamed; but the blood sprang no faster up into her cheeks than what it flowed back upon my own heart, at sight of it, with penitence and concern. I found no words to excuse myself, but bowed before her very deep, and went <b>my</b> <b>ways</b> <b>out</b> {{of the house with}} death in my bosom.|$|R

You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the part, {{and it may be that}} I have got a little {{careless}} in <b>my</b> <b>ways</b> <b>out</b> West. Among other things I bought these brown boots--gave six dollars for them--and had one stolen before ever I had them on my feet." ...|$|R

500|$|Christian Louboutin {{said that}} he would {{dedicate}} his time to creating some [...] "scene-stealing designs for the single's video", out of his appreciation for the song. According to Rap-Up, Lopez was scheduled to film the music video for the song in January 2010. She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's going to be about that woman, you know when you have that moment when you realize you have to really get out of here that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video. Even when you know that it's gonna hurt later, you feel good about making the decision, so you're like [...] "I decided! I'm walking up out the house right now" [...] and that's the part we're gonna do in the video except I'm gonna dance <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> the house." ...|$|E
500|$|After the April 10, 1967, {{recording}} session, the Experience {{spent the}} next two weeks playing shows and attending promotional appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC television program Monday Monday and BBC2's Late Night Line-Up. Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer completed the final mixing of Are You Experienced at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had agreed to audition the finished LP for Polydor's head of A, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so after a couple hours of sleep he prepared a suitable vinyl demo and traveled to Polydor. Chandler recalled: [...] "As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out in a cold sweat, thinking... when he hears this, he's going to order the men in white coats to take me away... Horst played the first side through and didn't say a word. Then he turned the disk over and played the other side. I started thinking about how I was going to talk <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of this. At {{the end of the second}} side, he just sat there. Finally, he said, 'This is brilliant. This is the greatest thing I've ever heard.'" [...] Horst immediately became an ardent supporter of the album and the band, championing the marketing and distribution of their debut LP.|$|E
2500|$|John Grieve {{said the}} {{avalanche}} was initiated by a climber who dislodged a huge sheet of snow, sending {{it down on}} the nine other climbers who were swept [...] downhill. The climber avoided being swept away by digging into the mountain with his ice axe before he composed himself to alert the emergency services. The surviving climbers had begun to unearth their friends' bodies from the snow with their ice axes by the time the rescue team had arrived. Fifty-year-old Jim Coyne from Lindsayfield, East Kilbride, said he and 53-year-old David Barr from Paisley, were on the mountain when a slab of snow came away from the peak. Barr sustained the shoulder injury. Coyne told of how they were just below the summit when the avalanche occurred, describing it as [...] "massive" [...] and saying they were ... engulfed and I managed to dig <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out.</b> As I tried to get my bearings I saw an arm sticking out of the snow. It was Davie. I dug for 10 minutes using just my hands to get him free. 54-year-old Tom Richardson, an experienced climber from Sheffield in England, also had a narrow escape and subsequently alerted the emergency services.|$|E

60|$|No {{words can}} be more exquisitely, and in all points, useless; and I merely speak of them that I may, at once and for ever, get them <b>out</b> of <b>my</b> <b>way</b> and <b>out</b> of <b>my</b> reader's. But to get that done, they must be explained.|$|R
2500|$|When Taishi Ci {{arrived at}} Pingyuan, he told Liu Bei, [...] "I, (Taishi) Ci, am a {{commoner}} from Donglai. I am neither a relative nor {{an acquaintance of}} Kong Rong. But I have heard of him and we not only share similar beliefs, but also experienced difficult times together. Now, Guan Hai and the rebels have besieged Kong Rong; he is desperately in need of help. You are known for your kindness, righteousness, and willingness to help those in need. Kong Rong admires you and has placed his hopes in you, hence he sent me to fight <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the siege to seek help from you. Only you can save him." [...] Liu Bei's facial expression turned serious and he said, [...] "So Kong Rong knows that Liu Bei exists in this world!" [...] He then sent 3,000 troops to follow Taishi Ci back to Duchang. When the rebels heard that reinforcements had arrived, they fled and the siege of Duchang was automatically lifted. Kong Rong regarded Taishi Ci even more highly after this event. He told Taishi Ci, [...] "You are a young friend of mine." [...] When Taishi Ci returned home and told his mother about it, she said, [...] "I am very happy that you can repay Kong Rong's kindness in this way." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{received}} this with another and more indignant 'Pah!' and I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> {{of her room}} (I think I felt <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> with my hands, although my eyes were open), almost suspecting that my voice had a repulsive sound, and that I was a repulsive object.|$|E

5000|$|In 1971, {{his first}} book I Am Going <b>My</b> <b>Way</b> came <b>out.</b> His {{literary}} mentor Yuri Trifonov provided a foreword for it. Prokhanov later remembered: [...] "He liked the expressiveness, experiments with language, the flow of metaphors, my naive youthful pantheism... But my first social-oriented novellas made him skeptical, his tone became tougher and he entrusted me with another patron, Vladimir Makanin, who was my good friend at the time." ...|$|R
