6000|$|The {{devices of}} this {{character}} employed by various plants for the dispersal of seeds even in ordinary dry capsules {{are far too}} numerous for me to describe in full detail, though they form a delightful subject for individual study in any small suburban garden. I will only give one more illustrative case, just to show the sort of point an amateur should always be on the look-out for. There is an extremely common, though inconspicuous, English weed, the <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>chickweed,</b> found everywhere in flower-beds or grass-plots, however small, and noticeable for its quaint little horn-shaped capsules. These have a very odd sort of twist or cock-up in the middle, just above the part where the seeds lie; and they open at the top by ten small teeth, pointed obliquely outward for no apparent reason. Yet every point has a meaning of its own for all that. The plant is one that lies rather close upon the ground; {{and the effect of}} this twist in the capsule is that the seeds, which are relatively heavy, and well stored with nutriment, can never get out at all, unless a very strong wind is blowing, which sweeps over the herbage in long quick waves, and carries everything it shakes out for great distances before it. So much design have even the smallest weeds put into the mechanism for the dispersion of their precious seeds, the hope of their race and the earnest of their future! ...|$|E

5000|$|Cerastium fontanum, {{also called}} <b>Mouse-ear</b> <b>chickweed,</b> Common mouse-ear, or Starweed is {{a species of}} mat-forming {{perennial}} or, rarely, annual plant. It is native to Europe but introduced elsewhere. Mouse-ear chickweed's identifying characteristics are tear-shaped leaves growing opposite {{one another in a}} star pattern, hairy leaves, and small white flowers. <b>Mouse-ear</b> <b>chickweed</b> typically grows to 4"-8" [...] tall vertically and spreads horizontally along the ground via the formation of roots wherever the stem falls over and contacts the ground.|$|E

50|$|Cerastium pumilum, {{the dwarf}} <b>mouse-ear</b> or European <b>chickweed,</b> is an annual or {{biannual}} herbaceous plant, between 2 and 20 cm. high, native to Central and western Europe. The petals {{of the white}} flowers are shorter or equally long as the sepals, and split in the middle, up to {{a quarter of the}} length.

50|$|Cerastium is a genus of annual, winter annual, or {{perennial}} plants {{belonging to the}} family Caryophyllaceae. They are commonly called <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>chickweed.</b> Species are found nearly worldwide but the greatest concentration is in the northern temperate regions. There are about 200 species. A number are common weeds in fields and on disturbed ground.|$|E
5000|$|Cerastium glomeratum is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the pink family known by the common names sticky <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>chickweed</b> and clammy chickweed. It is probably native to Eurasia but it is known on most continents as an introduced species. It grows in many types of habitat. The blooming period is February, March, April, and May.|$|E
50|$|The Kerguelen Islands {{are in the}} Southern Indian Ocean Islands tundra {{ecoregion}} {{which is}} characterised by tussock grasses, lichens and liverworts. A. magellanica {{is one of the}} few low forbs that grew here, but the introduction of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), which selectively grazes the species it prefers, eliminated many of the native forbs. When the rabbit was eradicated, A. magellanica and other forbs failed to recover because years of herbivory had depleted their seed banks, and introduced species such as annual meadow grass (Poa annua), <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>chickweed</b> (Cerastium fontanum) and dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) out-competed them.|$|E

5000|$|Lillering Forest and {{surroundings}} {{has been}} known as a botanically interesting locality for many years with the earliest description dating back to 1877 (Zahrtmann 1877). Some 400 vascular plants have been registered, {{about a third of}} Danish plants. A number of plants primarily exist in south-eastern Denmark, and further south, with the northern boundary being at or around Aarhus and some of these are well represented in Lillering Forest. The most important might be hornbeam which has a significant presence. Others are plants such as dead-nettles, white butterbur, bitter-cress, wall barley, yellow and blue anemone and the endangered multicolored viola. In addition a total of nine species of orchids have been registered although in later years only six has been noted - these are the broad-leaved helleborine, green-flowered helleborine, early-purple orchid, western marsh orchid, early marsh-orchid, eggleaf twayblade and the greater butterfly-orchid. The border zone between Tåstrup Bog and Lillering Forest contains woodland geranium and mountain melick. The area contains several rare species of geometer moths associated with buckthorns that grow at the woodland edge or in Tåstrup Bog. The nearby meadows is home to a rare, small owl that lives on species of <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>chickweed.</b> The meadows in the forest has a number of moths such as the six-spot burnet which are endangered in Denmark. Some 6 species are registered of which 3 in Jutland are found only here and 4 are associated with hackberry at the woodland edge. The stream Bøgebakke Bæk has a large population of the uncommon mayfly siphlonurus aestivalis. == Natura 2000 == The Natura 2000 protected area includes Tåstrup Lake and adjoining wetlands (c. 20 ha.), Tåstrup Bog (c. 25 ha.), Lillering Forest (ca. 50 ha.) and Stjær Forest consisting of the forests Søskov and Stjær Stenskov (c. 20 ha). The four areas are not connected since former agricultural land separates Lillering Forest and Tåstrup Bog to the north and Tåstrup Lake and Stjær Forest to the south.|$|E
40|$|Thirty-one {{kinds of}} plants {{representing}} 12 families were tested for host suitability to Xiphinema bakeri. Sixteen supported a significant population increase but only {{members of the}} Rosaceae and Solanaceae were severely damaged. Eight of the 12 weed species tested were good hosts; <b>Mouse-ear</b> <b>chickweed</b> allowed the greatest population increase of all plants tested. Populations of X. bakeri declined under selected members of the Cruciferae and Cucurbitaceae more than in fallow soil after 12 weeks. Numbers of X. bakeri as low as one per 5 cc of soil reduced root and top growth of raspberry 40 - 50 %. Where 100 and 500 nematodes per 10. 5 cm-diameter pot were used the mean weight of roots was reduced 54 % and 77 %, the tops 59 % and 78 % and the linear growth 48 % and 78 %, respectively. This is the first report of an ectoparasitic nematode pathogenic to raspberry...|$|E
