One of the contributions of SSME may be to help service managers to achieve standardization and its more sophisticated sibling, assembly of standardized <b>modular</b> <b>service</b> elements in several [...] "customizable" [...] but highly predictable permutations. Many customers seek and value standardization because it reduces variability and usually helps bring prices down. Services in the digital economy employ standardization and mass customization.

40|$|Abstract: The {{field of}} service modularity, unlike product modularity, is widely new {{area in the}} research. Therefore, {{there is not much}} {{knowledge}} about the <b>modular</b> <b>service</b> architecture. Therefore, this research tries to fill the research gap and find the key characteristics of the <b>modular</b> <b>service</b> architecture. The objective of the thesis is to create more understanding about the service modularity and the modular value chain structure. This research aims to describe the value chain structure {{from the perspective of the}} travel agency and link the roles and responsibilities of customer and suppliers to the modular value chain. To address the issue, comparative study with two companies with different level of <b>modular</b> <b>service</b> architecture is selected. The study is conducted as multiple-case study with semi-structured interviews and secondary data research. To analyze the data a theoretical framework is developed that helps to identify the <b>modular</b> <b>service</b> dimensions and the level of the service modularity. The findings suggest that the highly modular value chain has three important characteristics. The first one is the wide collaboration with customer and co-creation of service offerings. The second one is the long-term relationship with the suppliers. The final characteristic is the continuous two-way communication with its suppliers and customers that enables the responsive and flexible service structure. These findings are formulated as hypotheses that should be further tested with quantitative methods...|$|E

40|$|The {{demise of}} first {{generation}} service models of application service providers (ASP) indicates that moving from individualized services (e. g. many outsourcing offerings) to fully standardised services (e. g. first generation ASP models) leaves many customer requirements unfilled. In our paper {{we argue that}} a possible solution for building innovative e-services {{is the use of}} <b>modular</b> <b>service</b> architectures. Firstly, the paper introduces the characteristics of IT services, based on a case study with a leading German pro-vider of application hosting services in the ERP market. We pay particular attention to the general composition of IT services, the role of external factors (how customers and their resources participate in service operations), and varying customer preferences. Secondly, the paper explains the general concept of modularity. The concept of modularity is then applied to the domain of IT services. We specifically address how the concept of <b>modular</b> <b>service</b> architecture addresses external factors, and varying service level requirements. We give an example how the concept of <b>modular</b> <b>service</b> architectures can leveraged to improve the design and to allow for improved customization of IT services. Thirdly, we discuss the general advantages and disadvantages of modular architec-tures. We conclude with identifying possible further considerations that need to be taken into consideration t...|$|E
40|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for today 9 ̆ 2 s users to have access to more than one device, including PC 9 ̆ 2 s, PDA 9 ̆ 2 s and mobile phones. If the user wants to access services from a remote location, he has to manually customize a connection to each of these services. This thesis aims to make these kinds of services available without complex configuration, using a modular framework. As an example, new hardware or software might be needed in order to integrate home services and mobile devices. These circumstances make it hard for a regular user to deploy new services at home. At the same time people become more and more mobile, and users are moving from being passive consumers to interactive participants of the Internet. The general idea of ubiquitous communication between hosts in the Internet is brought down to a practical level by creating a use case where a user would like to search and retrieve files present in his home network while at a remote location. Solutions to non trivial challenges such as NAT and firewall implications, bandwidth restrictions, modular system architecture, and usability are examined to make a <b>modular</b> <b>service</b> platform meeting the demands of more interactive and mobile environments. The XMPP protocol, mostly known as an instant messaging and presence protocol, is utilized to create a web of trust between services and users. To achieve the goal of making a <b>modular</b> <b>service</b> platform, providing connectivity that allows services and users to be mobile, a working prototype has been made. The prototype consists of a <b>modular</b> <b>service</b> platform, enabling services to be added as plug-ins. The service platform is divided in two parts; one part enabling connectivity using a third party solution, and one part enabling a modular framework to add services as plug-ins. The functionality was tested with a network search as an example service, developed as a plug-in using the <b>modular</b> <b>service</b> platform...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{relationship}} between service innovation and firm’s performances in the KIBS domain. In line with previous works, we maintain that service innovation positively impacts firm’s performances but we also claim that this relationship {{is likely to be}} moderated by how the service firm conceives its service configuration. Particularly, we point out that service configurations based on standard and <b>modular</b> <b>services</b> positively moderate the positive relationship between innovation and performance. Using a sample of 239 Italian KIBS firms, we empirically test our model. Results confirm that service innovation is positively associated with firm’s performances both as market size and, albeit weakly, as ROI growth. Results also confirm the positive moderating role of standard services while the moderating role of <b>modular</b> <b>services</b> is only marginal. Overall, we contribute to the existing literature of KIBS and service innovation showing that service innovation and service customization should be considered as separate and that KIBS firms can experience increasing returns if they are able to combine service innovation and service standardization...|$|R
40|$|Part 10 : Collaborative SystemsInternational audienceAs cloud {{computing}} is increasingly adopted, {{the trend is}} to offer software functions as <b>modular</b> <b>services</b> and compose them into larger, more meaningful ones. The trend is attractive to analytical problems in the manufacturing system design and performance improvement domain because (1) finding a global optimization for the system is a complex problem; and (2) sub-problems are typically compartmentalized by the organizational structure. However, solving sub-problems by independent services {{can result in a}} sub-optimal solution at the system level. This paper investigates the technique called Analytical Target Cascading (ATC) to coordinate the optimization of loosely-coupled sub-problems, each may be modularly formulated by differing departments and be solved by <b>modular</b> analytical <b>services.</b> The result demonstrates that ATC is a promising method in that it offers system-level optimal solutions that can scale up by exploiting distributed and modular executions while allowing easier management of the problem formulation...|$|R
