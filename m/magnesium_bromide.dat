The reaction of LiNH_ 2 and Li_ 2 NH with lithium or <b>magnesium</b> chloride, <b>bromide</b> and iodide {{has been shown to}} form a series of amide- and imide-halide phases.

40|$|The {{success of}} {{homogeneous}} asymmetric catalysis has {{been attributed to}} the structure and stereochemistry of the coordinated ligand(s). The most effective ligands are C 2 -symmetrical bisphosphines containing either a rigid chiral backbone linking two PPh 2 units or a bisphosphine, DIPAMP containing two chiral phosphine units linked by an achiral backbone. The synthesis of P-chiral ligands of this type has been severely hindered by the lack of a general synthetic route allowing the incorporation of phosphorus chirality without the need for separation of diastereomeric precursors or resolution of intermediate enantiomers. The objective of this work was to develop a general synthetic route to homochiral bulky arylphosphines with substantial flexibility in the groups at phosphorus and extend the approach to new P-chiral bisphosphines. In one approach, diastereomerically pure (2 R, 4 S, 5 R) - 2, 5 -diphenyl- 3, 4 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 2 -oxazaphospholidine was prepared directly from PhPCl 2 using l -ephedrine as a chiral auxiliary. Stereospecific oxidation using Bu t OOH gave the corresponding P-oxide which was shown to have R -stereochemistry at phosphorus by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The compound reacted regiospecifically with ortho -anisylmagnesium bromide to afford the product formed by P-O bond cleavage with > 96 % d. e. and with retention of configuration at phosphorus as demonstrated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The l -ephedrine residue was replaced by O-methyl under acid-catalysis with inversion of configuration and with > 95 % e. e., the reaction was monitored by 1 H n. m. r. spectroscopy which gave t 1 / 2 of ca. 30 min. Attempts to incorporate para -fluorophenol using similar conditions led to the isolation of the pyrophosphinate in low yield. The OMe residue in the methyl (ortho -anisyl) phenylphosphinate was readily displaced by aliphatic Grignard reagents giving the corresponding phosphine oxides with inversion of configuration and with > 95 % e. e [...] Displacement of methoxy using aryl <b>magnesium</b> <b>bromides</b> showed similar enantioselectivity but in lower chemical yield, however the corresponding arylmagnesium chlorides were more efficient. In a second approach, diastereomerically pure (2 R, 4 S, 5 R) - 2 -chloro- 3, 4 -dimethyl- 5 -phenyl- 1, 3, 2 -oxazaphospholidine was prepared from PCl 3 and l -ephedrine. The compound underwent diastereoselective P-C 1 cleavage with aryl Grignard and aryllithium reagents with net retention of configuration at phosphorus and with 90 % d. e [...] Oxidation of the ortho -anisyl derivative afforded (2 R, 4 S, 5 R) - 2 -(ortho -anisyl) - 3, 4 -dimethyl- 5 -phenyl- 1, 3, 2 -oxazaphospholidine- 2 -oxide which was subsequently reacted with a range of bulky aryl Grignard reagents to afford the corresponding biarylphosphinamides with retention of configuration at phosphorus. Subsequent acid-catalysed methanolysis and displacement of the methoxy residue with PhMgCl afforded a range of bulky arylphosphine oxides with defined configuration at phosphorus with > 95 % e. e. as determined by 1 H n. m. r. methods. (S) - ortho -anisyl (meta -anisyl) phenylphosphine oxide underwent regiospecific ortho -lithiation on the meta -anisyl ring which on quenching with D 2 O afforded the corresponding 2 -deuteride in 80 % yield. The 2 -iodo analogue was also prepared although in low chemical purity and is a key precursor to new axially dissymmetric bisphosphines containing chiral phosphorus centres. Other approaches to P-chiral ferrocenyl ligands and biaryl ligands are also described and modifications for further development are implicated. An X-ray crystallographic study of six aryl-oxazaphospholidines is also presented and demonstrates the influence of the substituents at phosphorus in determining the conformation of the 1, 3, 2 -oxazaphospholidine ring.

The effect of DSS concentration and temperature on these properties of GG-DSS gels was investigated.

40|$|Highlights - Detailed {{analysis}} of water produced from 150 coal seam gas wells. - Water quality varied {{as a function}} of location and well depth. - Associated water was generally not suitable for reuse with further treatment. - PCA revealed 3 groups of dissolved species which described relationships in water quality. - Water composition fluctuation may influence strategies for water resource development. Abstract The rapidly developing coal seam gas industry produces significant volumes of associated brackish water which needs to be appropriately managed. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the variability of water composition within and between multiple gas fields in a defined geographic area and to discover relationships between species present. Water quality from 150 coal seam gas production wells from the Surat Basin, Queensland has been analysed. Chemical analysis revealed the associated water to predominantly contain bicarbonate (< 2030 mg/L), chloride (< 5910 mg/L) and sodium (< 3700 mg/L) species. In several instances, water parameters such as fluoride, were above recommended limits for direct beneficial reuse. Principal component analysis revealed three groups of water quality parameters which described the data. Iron, manganese and aluminium were in one group; <b>bromide,</b> <b>magnesium,</b> strontium, potassium, hardness, calcium, chloride, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids and sodium appeared as a second group and a third group comprised of fluoride, bicarbonate alkalinity as CaCO 3, sodium adsorption ratio, pH, boron, silica, total organic carbon, and sulfate. The variability in water compositions may impact on water management technologies such as reverse osmosis as there may be a propensity for membrane fouling by alkaline earth ions or silica. This study suggested that the mineral quantities in coal such as clay, sulfide ores, oxide ores, quartz and phosphates may correlate with the water quality patterns. Through the use of multivariate analysis it was shown that depth of the CSG production well and the location of the CSG production well did not correlate with differing water quality patterns. The physical and chemical parameters that were analysed in this study will aid in the efficient management of associated water and provide information which allows better understanding of environmental impacts and the prospect for beneficial reuse...|$|R

Substitution takes place with complete inversion of configuration at the electrophilic carbon.(9)Generally, organocuprates react with allylic electrophiles in an anti SN2 fashion. In the reaction below, nearly complete inversion of configuration was observed despite the presence of a second stereocenter in the ring.(10)Conjugate addition of organocuprates is widely used in organic synthesis. Vinyl ether cuprates serve as convenient acyl anion equivalents in conjugate addition reactions to enones. The resulting enol ethers can be hydrolyzed to 1,4-diketones, which are difficult to access using conventional carbonyl chemistry.(11)The use of additives in conjunction with a stoichiometric amount of organocopper complexes enhances the rate and yield of many reactions. Organocopper complexes in particular react sluggishly {{in the absence of a}} Lewis acid. Although <b>magnesium</b> <b>bromide</b> generated in situ from the reaction of Grignard reagents and copper(I) halides can serve this role (see above), external Lewis acids are also useful.
