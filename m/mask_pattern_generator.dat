40|$|MEBES ® 50 kV <b>mask</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>generators</b> use Raster Graybeam ™ writing, {{providing}} an effective grid that is 32 × finer than the print grid. The electron beam size and print pixel size are variable between 60 nm and 120 nm, allowing a tradeoff between resolution and write time. Raster scan printing optimizes throughput by transferring precisely {{the amount of}} data to the mask {{that is consistent with}} the chosen resolution. As with other raster output devices, mask write times are not affected by pattern complexity. This paper examines the theoretical performance of Raster Graybeam for model-based optical proximity correction (OPC) patterns and provides examples of <b>mask</b> <b>patterning</b> performance. A simulation tool is used to model the MEBES eXara ™ system writing strategy, which uses four writing passes, interstitial print grids, offset scans, and eight dose levels per pass. It is found that Raster Graybeam produces aerial image quality equivalent to the convolution of the input pattern data with a Gaussian point spread function. Resolution of 90 nm is achieved for equal lines and spaces, supporting subresolution assist features. Angled features are a particular strength of raster scan patterning, with feature quality and write time that are independent of feature orientation...|$|R

40|$|The central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> for {{swimming}} Xenopus embryo is organized as two half-centres linked by reciprocal inhibition. Microelectrode recordings suggest that Xenopus neurons are poorly excitable, necessitating {{a key role}} for postinhibitory rebound {{in the operation of}} the central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator.</b> However the Xenopus central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> seems unusual in that the component neurons apparently have no intrinsic or conditional rhythmogenic properties. We have re-examined the firing properties of Xenopus embryo spinal neurons by making patch-clamp recordings in situ from intact spinal cord. Recordings made from 99 neurons were divided into three groups. Central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> neurons overwhelmingly (44 / 51) fired trains of action potentials in response to current injection. Just over half of the sensory interneurons (13 / 22) also fired trains of action potentials. Neurons that received no synaptic inputs during swimming mostly fired just one or two action potentials (22 / 26). Thirty-four neurons were identified morphologically. Commissural (8 / 12) and descending (6 / 6) interneurons, key components of the spinal central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator,</b> fired repetitive trains of action potentials during current injection. Neurons that were not part of the central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> did not demonstrate this preponderance for repetitive firing. Analysis of the interspike intervals during current injection revealed that the majority of central <b>pattern</b> <b>generators,</b> descending and commissural interneurons, could readily fire at frequencies up to twice that of swimming. We suggest that Xenopus neurons can be considered as conditional oscillators: in the presence of unpatterned excitation they exhibit an ability to fire rhythmically. This property makes the Xenopus embryonic central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> more similar to other model central <b>pattern</b> <b>generators</b> than has hitherto been appreciated...|$|R

The present article proposes a central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> and feedforward neural network-based self-adaptive gait control method for a crab-like robot locomoting on complex terrain under two reflex mechanisms.

The purpose of this thesis is to understand the neural control of respiration through mathematical models of the respiratory central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> and phrenic motor neurons. ^ We first designed and validated a Hodgkin-Huxley type model that mimics the behavior of phrenic motor neurons under a wide range of electrical and pharmacological perturbations. This model was constrained physiological data from the literature. Next, we designed and validated a model of the respiratory central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> by connecting four Hodgkin-Huxley type models of medullary respiratory neurons in a mutually inhibitory network. This network was in turn driven by a simple model of an endogenously bursting neuron, which acted as the pacemaker for the respiratory central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator.</b> Finally, the respiratory central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> and phrenic motor neuron models were connected and their interactions studied. ^ Our study of the models has provided a number of insights into the behavior of the respiratory central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> and phrenic motor neurons. These include the suggestion of a role for the T-type and N-type calcium channels during single spikes and repetitive firing in phrenic motor neurons, as well as a better understanding of network properties underlying respiratory rhythm generation.

SLING can synthesize linear test <b>pattern</b> <b>generators</b> that satisfy constraints on area, speed, internal fanout, and randomness properties and outperform existing linear test <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> designs including linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) and cellular automatons (CAs). SLING is a constraint-driven synthesis procedure that takes as input {{a set of}} constraints and then synthesizes a test <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> that satisfies those constraints. SLING uses a set of linear transformations that it applies iteratively to evolve a linear test <b>pattern</b> <b>generator.</b> Because {{of the way the}} transformations are chosen and constraints are set, a high degree of phase shift is maintained between every pair of linear sequences generated at different bit positions of the generator and cross and auto correlations are highly minimized.

30|$|Alignment of mask edges along crystallographic {{directions}} on wafer surface plays {{a significant role}} in controlling the shape and size of etched profiles. In order to align the <b>mask</b> <b>patterns</b> with respect to the crystallographic {{directions on}} the wafer surface, primary flat is commonly employed as reference. In this case, any degree of misorientation in primary flat leads to the misalignment of <b>mask</b> <b>patterns</b> with respect to crystallographic directions.

The main purpose of a digital <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> is to stimulate the inputs of a digital electronic device.
