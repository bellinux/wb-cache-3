500|$|Also defined herewith: passive anting. A self-anointing {{behaviour}} {{during which}} birds rub insects, usually ants, on their [...] and skin. The bird may {{pick up the}} insects in their [...] and rub them on the body, or the bird may lie {{in an area of}} high density of the insects and perform dust bathing-like movements. The insects secrete liquids containing chemicals such as formic acid, which can act as an insecticide, <b>miticide,</b> fungicide or bactericide. Alternatively, anting could make the insects edible by removing the distasteful acid, or, possibly supplement the bird's own preen oil. Instead of ants, some birds can also use millipedes. More than 200 species of bird are known to ant. The practice may be called [...] "passive anting", when a bird simply positions itself to allow ants to crawl through its plumage.|$|E

5|$|Most beekeepers {{affected}} by CCD {{report that they}} use antibiotics and <b>miticides</b> in their colonies, though the lack of uniformity as to which particular chemicals they use makes it unlikely that any single such chemical is involved. However, {{it is possible that}} not all such chemicals in use have been tested for possible effects on honey bees, and could therefore potentially be contributing to the CCD phenomenon. Beekeepers use <b>miticides</b> to rid colonies of Varroa infestations; however, treatment can lead to higher levels of viral infections in colonies. High doses of treatment or the use of <b>miticides</b> {{for an extended period of}} time can lead to immune-suppression in honey bees, making them more susceptible to viruses. A widespread occurrence of viral infections within a beehive can lead to colony collapse. Although <b>miticides</b> are not a direct cause of CCD they do play a role in it.|$|R

40|$|Larvae of {{the honey}} bee (Apis mellifera) can get {{infected}} {{and killed by}} the fungus Ascosphaera apis, which consumes the larva from inside out, then dries, creating a mummy, so-called chalkbrood. A warm or chilling shock to the brood accentuates the disease. Recently, beekeepers have reported increased chalkbrood in their colonies. Examining record books of these colonies indicate treatment with {{high fructose corn syrup}} (HFCS), antibiotics, and <b>miticides.</b> To examine the link that may exist between chalkbrood and treatments applied to colonies, growth rate of A. apis was determined by fungus culture under strong chalkbrood-inducing temperatures on agar supplemented with crushed bee larvae as a mock-infection. Implementing chilling, or warming cues caused no particular growth rate enhancement of A. apis, while <b>miticides</b> had a negative effect on growth, sometimes killing the fungus. HFCS and antibiotics, alone and mixed, did not positively or negatively alter growth of A. apis. We conclude that chalkbrood is not a pathogenic consequence of HFCS, antibiotics, <b>miticides,</b> or temperature shocks, but rather is related to the bee where these treatments signal other health problems that make the bee more prone to infection...|$|R

A chilling or warming stress known to heighten chalkbrood caused no growth enhancement of A. apis. <b>Miticides</b> had a negative effect; formic acid killed A. apis and oxalic acid reduced growth by 70  %. High-fructose corn syrups and sucrose syrup undiluted, a 50 : 50 mixture, alone, and with antibiotics did not alter growth of A. apis. We conclude that chalkbrood does not develop from a temperature- or treatment-induced activation of A. apis. Sugar syrups, <b>miticides,</b> and antibiotics point out other health problems that make bees prone to infection by A. apis.

40|$|Aflatoxin {{production}} inhibitors, {{which do}} not inhibit the growth of aflatoxigenic fungi, {{may be used to}} control aflatoxin without incurring a rapid spread of resistant strains. A respiration inhibitor that inhibits aflatoxin production was identified during a screening process for natural, aflatoxin-production inhibitors. This prompted us to evaluate respiration inhibitors as potential aflatoxin control agents. The inhibitory activities of four natural inhibitors, seven synthetic <b>miticides,</b> and nine synthetic fungicides were evaluated on aflatoxin production in Aspergillus parasiticus. All of the natural inhibitors (rotenone, siccanin, aptenin A 5, and antimycin A) inhibited fungal aflatoxin production with IC 50 values around 10 µM. Among the synthetic <b>miticides,</b> pyridaben, fluacrypyrim, and tolfenpyrad exhibited strong inhibitory activities with IC 50 values less than 0. 2 µM, whereas cyflumetofen did not show significant inhibitory activity. Of the synthetic fungicides, boscalid, pyribencarb, azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and kresoxim-methyl demonstrated strong inhibitory activities, with IC 50 values less than 0. 5 µM. Fungal growth was not significantly affected by any of the inhibitors tested at concentrations used. There was no correlation observed between the targets of respiration inhibitors (complexes I, II, and III) and their IC 50 values for aflatoxin-production inhibitory activity. This study suggests that respiration inhibitors, including commonly used pesticides, are useful for aflatoxin control...|$|R
40|$|The ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor, and {{the viruses}} that it transmits, kill the colonies of European honey bees (Apis mellifera) kept by beekeepers unless the bees {{are treated with}} <b>miticides.</b> Nevertheless, there exist populations of wild colonies of European honey bees that are {{persisting}} without being treated with <b>miticides.</b> We hypothesized that the persistence of these wild colonies {{is due in part}} to their habits of nesting in small cavities and swarming frequently. We tested this hypothesis by establishing two groups of colonies living either in small hives (42 L) without swarm- control treatments or in large hives (up to 168 L) with swarm-control treatments. We followed the colonies for two years and compared the two groups with respect to swarming frequency, Varroa infesttion rate, disease incidence, and colony survival. Colonies in small hives swarmed more often, had lower Varroa infestation rates, had less disease, and had higher survival compared to colonies in large hives. These results indicate that the smaller nest cavities and more frequent swarming of wild colonies contribute to their persistence without mite treatments.
