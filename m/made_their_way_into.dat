5|$|Hall, who had {{converted}} to the Roman Catholic Church in 1912, was devoutly religious. She {{was also a}} believer in communication with the dead who had once hoped to become a medium– a fact that brought her into conflict with the church, which condemned spiritualism. Both these beliefs <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> The Well of Loneliness.|$|E

2500|$|Professor Gershom Sholem theorizes {{that the}} [...] "Star of David" [...] {{originates}} {{in the writings}} of Aristotle, who used triangles in different positions to indicate the different basic elements. The superposed triangles thus represented combinations of those elements. From Aristotle's writings those symbols <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> <b>into</b> early, pre-Muslim Arab literature.|$|R
2500|$|Nineteenth-century Russian writers, {{starting}} with Ivan Zabelin, emphasized {{the influence of}} the vernacular wooden churches of the Russian North; <b>their</b> motifs <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> <b>into</b> masonry, particularly the votive churches that did not need to house substantial s. David Watkin also wrote of a blend of Russian and Byzantine roots, calling the cathedral [...] "the climax" [...] of Russian vernacular wooden architecture.|$|R
5|$|After Aubers Ridge, {{the corps}} was then rested {{in a quiet}} sector until September, when it {{deployed}} for the Battle of Loos. The initial attack was {{to be made by}} three divisions, with the Meerut Division leading the attack on the Indian front; Blackader's brigade, with two Gurkha battalions and the 2nd Leicesters, was on its right flank. Whilst the attack successfully crossed no-man's land under cover of the barrage, the right flank of the brigade was caught up in defensive wire, and only one battalion successfully <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the German trenches; the brigade lost momentum and dug in.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} {{carnivorous}} {{nature and the}} beauty of their glistening traps, sundews have become favorite ornamental plants; however, the environmental requirements of most species are relatively stringent and can be difficult to meet in cultivation. As a result, most species are unavailable commercially. A few of the hardiest varieties, however, have <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the mainstream nursery business and can often be found for sale next to Venus flytraps. These most often include D. capensis, D. aliciae, and D. spatulata.|$|E
5|$|Hindman's parents, Thomas Hindman and Sallie Holt Hindman, were of English and Scottish ancestry. His {{maternal}} ancestors included Major Robert Holt, {{a successful}} planter {{and a member}} of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1655. The Holt family originally came from Halifax County, Virginia before moving to Knoxville. Hindman's paternal lineage descended from the Carmichael clan in Scotland, some members of which <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> America after King George II of Great Britain ousted nine hundred Scottish followers of Bonnie Prince Charles to America after the April 16, 1746 Battle of Culloden.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the course}} of his life, Skiff amassed one of the most {{important}} private libraries in the United States, with particular emphases on literature and history. After his death in 1947, the library's contents were sold at auction by Butterfield & Butterfield (now Bonham's) in San Francisco. Many of the books <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> <b>into</b> other important collections. Countess Doheny purchased 800 books from Skiff's library, becoming part of the Estelle Doheny Collection of American Literature, which was in turn auctioned off by Christie's New York in 2001.|$|R

5|$|Blackburn Rovers {{were seeking}} {{to emulate the}} success of rivals Blackburn Olympic, who were the current holders of the trophy, and the team that Queen's Park {{defeated}} in the semi-final. Rovers had previously reached the FA Cup final, in 1882, where they were defeated by Old Etonians. Blackburn trained during the week prior to the game by conducting practise games and going for walks. They departed for the London area by train {{on the day before}} the final; a large crowd of local supporters gathered at the train station in Blackburn to wish them well as they left. The team stayed in Richmond the night before the match and <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the city at lunchtime on the Saturday.|$|E
5|$|Early {{concepts}} {{were very}} different from the final film. The initial version featured a floating castle with two brothers vying to inherit their father's kingdom, and when the brothers fell to Earth, they encountered a tall bird who helped them understand each other. Docter's next idea introduced many of the elements that eventually <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the film, but had Carl and Russell landing the house on a Soviet-era spy airship camouflaged as a giant cloud rather than on a tepui. This concept was rewritten due to its similarity to another idea Pixar was developing. Another idea Docter added, then removed, was magic fountain-of-youth eggs laid by the bird, in order to explain the age discrepancy between Muntz and Carl, but it was decided that this subplot was too distracting, and that people would forgive the minor inconsistency.|$|E
5|$|Parsons, the Enola Gays weaponeer, was {{concerned}} about the possibility of an accidental detonation if the plane crashed on takeoff, so he decided not to load the four cordite powder bags into the gun breech until the aircraft was in flight. Parsons and his assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the bomb bay along the narrow catwalk on the port side. Jeppson held a flashlight while Parsons disconnected the primer wires, removed the breech plug, inserted the powder bags, replaced the breech plug, and reconnected the wires. Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target, Jeppson switched the three safety plugs between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism from green to red. The bomb was then fully armed. Jeppson monitored the bomb's circuits.|$|E
50|$|A {{sizeable}} {{number of}} Old Toms <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> <b>into</b> the seminaries {{for training and}} induction into the priesthood. The school has produced two Catholic bishops and an Anglican bishop-elect for the clergy of the Republic of Ghana. They are the Most Rev. Vincent Sowah Boi-Nai (1966 year group) and Most Rev. Gabriel Edoe Kumordji (1976 year group), the Bishops of the Dioceses of Yendi in the Northern Region and the Prefecture of Donkorkrom in the Afram Plains district respectively. The Anglican Bishop-Elect of the Accra Dioceses of the Anglican Church is the Rt. Rev. D. S. M. Torto (1978 year group).|$|R

5|$|Politically {{the city}} was {{dominated}} by the Republican Party, which had developed a strong political machine. The Republicans dominated the post-war elections, and corrupt officials <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the government and continued to control the city through voter fraud and intimidation. The Gas Trust was {{the hub of the}} city’s political machine. The trust controlled the gas company supplying lighting to the city. With the board under complete control by Republicans in 1865, they awarded contracts and perks for themselves and their cronies. Some government reform did occur during this time. The police department was reorganized; and volunteer fire companies were eliminated and were replaced by a paid fire department. A compulsory school act passed in 1895, and the Public School Reorganization Act freed the city's education from the political machine. Higher education changed as well. The University of Pennsylvania moved to West Philadelphia and reorganized to its modern form; and Temple University, Drexel University and the Free Library were founded.|$|E
5|$|Seventy-eight {{people were}} killed while on a relief mission to Leninakan when a Soviet Ilyushin Il-76 crashed on {{approach}} to the airport there. Nine crew and 69 military personnel were on board the plane that struck a helicopter in foggy conditions at the small airport that was overrun with rescue flights. In the days following the earthquake, the normally quiet airstrip was receiving up to 180 flights per day carrying food, medical supplies, and disaster management experts. Those who were killed on the plane were planning to join an estimated 20,000 soldiers and 85,000 civil defence workers in rescue efforts by searching for survivors, supplying food and water, and setting up sanitation facilities in the region. At the Yerevan airport, western pilots reported a breakdown in air traffic control communications, with flight controllers not delivering the necessary flight navigation instructions, allowing for a critical lack of separation as foreign planes <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the area.|$|E
5|$|Starting in November, the I Squadronless the Wittelsbach-class ships, {{which were}} still {{occupied}} with trialsconducted {{a number of}} short cruises, culminating in the annual winter cruise that began on 1 December. The ships steamed into the Kattegat and stopped in Frederikshavn, Denmark, before continuing on to Bergen, where they stayed from 6 to 10 December. Kaiser Friedrich III {{and the rest of}} the squadron returned to Kiel, arriving two days later. On 2 April 1903, the squadron went to sea again, and began gunnery training two days later. These exercises continued for the rest of the month, interrupted only by heavy storms. A major training cruise followed the next month; on 10 May the ships departed the Elbe river and <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the Atlantic. They cruised south to Spain, passing Ushant on 14 May and reaching the Iberian Peninsula five days later. There, they conducted a reconnaissance exercise off Pontevedra before anchoring in Vigo on 20 May. Prince Heinrich left Kaiser Friedrich III for a visit to Madrid. After he returned, the squadron departed Spain on 30 May. The ships passed through the Strait of Dover on 3 June and continued into the Kattegat. There, they rendezvoused with the torpedo boats of the I Torpedobootsflotille (Torpedo Boat Flotilla)commanded by Korvettenkapitän (Lieutenant Commander) Franz von Hipperfor a mock attack on the fortifications at Kiel.|$|E

50|$|Indian {{companies}} are also starting to adapt their product development processes {{to the new}} environment. For years, firms have <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> <b>into</b> the global market by researching generic competitors to patented drugs and following up with litigation to challenge the patent. This approach remains untouched by the new patent regime and looks to increase in the future. However, those that can afford it have set their sights on an even higher goal: new molecule discovery. Although the initial investment is huge, {{companies are}} lured {{by the promise of}} hefty profit margins and thus a legitimate competitor in the global industry. Local firms have slowly been investing more money into their R&D programs or have formed alliances to tap into these opportunities.|$|R

5|$|Turkish cuisine is {{regarded}} as one of the most prominent in the world, its popularity is largely owed to the cultural influences of the Ottoman Empire and partly because of its major tourism industry. It is largely the heritage of Ottoman cuisine, which can be described as a fusion and refinement of Central Asian, Caucasian, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Balkan cuisines. The country's position between the East and the Mediterranean Sea helped the Turks gain complete control of major trade routes, and an ideal environment allowed plants and animals to flourish. Turkish cuisine was well established by the mid-1400s, the beginning of the Ottoman Empire's six hundred-year reign. Yogurt salads, fish in olive oil, and stuffed and wrapped vegetables became Turkish staples. The empire, eventually spanning from Austria to northern Africa, used its land and water routes to import exotic ingredients from all over the world. By the end of the 16th century, the Ottoman court housed over 1,400 live-in cooks and passed laws regulating the freshness of food. Since the fall of the empire in World War I (1914–1918) and the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, foreign food such as French hollandaise sauce and western fast food have <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the modern Turkish diet.|$|E
