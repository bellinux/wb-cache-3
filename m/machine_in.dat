5|$|American {{inventor}} John Wesley Hyatt {{together with}} his brother Isaiah, Hyatt patented the first injection moulding <b>machine</b> <b>in</b> 1872. This machine was relatively simple compared to machines in use today: it worked like a large hypodermic needle, using a plunger to inject plastic through a heated cylinder into a mould. The industry progressed slowly over the years, producing products such as collar stays, buttons, and hair combs.|$|E

5|$|A pancake {{machine is}} an electrically-powered machine that {{automatically}} produces cooked pancakes. It {{is believed that}} the earliest known pancake machine was invented in the United States in 1928. Several types of pancake machines exist that perform in various manners, for both commercial and home use. Some are fully automatic in operation, while others are semi-automatic. Some companies mass-produce pancake machines, and some have been homemade. The Happy Egg Company constructed a novelty pancake <b>machine</b> <b>in</b> 2013 in commemoration of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{approached}} Sony in late 1989 {{because it}} did not have enough engineers to handle the number of new products that were planned for delivery in 1991. Using a basic blueprint from Apple, including a list of chips and other components, and the Portable's architecture, the 100 was miniaturized and manufactured by Sony in San Diego, California, and Japan. Sony engineers had little experience building personal computers but nonetheless completed Apple's smallest and lightest <b>machine</b> <b>in</b> under 13months, cancelling other projects and giving the PowerBook100 top priority. Sony president Norio Ohga gave project manager Kihey Yamamoto permission to recruit engineers from any Sony division.|$|E
5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw <b>machine.</b> <b>In</b> both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland {{continued}} {{to defy the}} Senate by next appointing Wheeler Hazard Peckham another New York attorney who had opposed Hill's <b>machine</b> <b>in</b> that state. Hill used all of his influence to block Peckham's confirmation, and on February 16, 1894, the Senate rejected the nomination {{by a vote of}} 32 to 41. Reformers urged Cleveland to continue the fight against Hill and to nominate Frederic R. Coudert, but Cleveland acquiesced in an inoffensive choice, that of Senator Edward Douglass White of Louisiana, whose nomination was accepted unanimously. Later, in 1896, another vacancy on the Court led Cleveland to consider Hornblower again, but he declined to be nominated. Instead, Cleveland nominated Rufus Wheeler Peckham, the brother of Wheeler Hazard Peckham, and the Senate confirmed the second Peckham easily.|$|E

The critical failure of the album and tour were factors that led Bowie to look for a new way to motivate himself creatively, leading him to create the band Tin <b>Machine</b> <b>in</b> 1989 and to retire his back catalogue from live performances during his 1990 Sound+Vision Tour.
