5|$|Despite their {{differences}} on other matters, discussed at length in Carl von Clausewitz's {{study of the}} Campaign of 1815 and Wellington's famous 1842 essay in reply to it, the Prussian Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment. Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle prior to the Prussian intervention <b>more</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mutually exhausting stalemate than as an impending French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth was {{regarded}} by her contemporaries as an efficient but ruthless politician who used political intrigues {{to protect and}} defend her daughters' rights. She was a caring parent, but was neither politically talented nor competent to prepare Mary and Hedwig for their roles as monarchs. Elizabeth failed to {{set a good example}} for her daughters, and her unbalanced character and questionable methods in politics would serve <b>more</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> warning to the young sovereigns. Her procrastinations and inability to make clear decisions threatened Hedwig's status, while her endless problems with Croatian nobles and failure to improve relations with her native Bosnia made Mary's reign insecure and tumultuous.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle had lost its defensive role, and was used <b>more</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> military prison than a military fortification. Numerous people were executed or held captive in the prison, including Cossack starshynas (officers), haidamakas, and even the three-year-old pretender to the Polish throne, Stanisław August Poniatowski.|$|E

5|$|Simeon {{turned the}} new Bulgarian capital Preslav into a {{magnificent}} {{religious and cultural}} centre, intended <b>more</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> display of his realm's heyday and as a royal residence than as a military fortress. With its more than twenty cross-domed churches and numerous monasteries, its impressive royal palace and the Golden (or Round) Church, Preslav was a true imperial capital. The development of Bulgarian art in the period is demonstrated by a ceramic icon of Theodore Stratelates and the Preslav-style illustrated ceramics.|$|E
5|$|Teresa Cristina {{had grown}} to be {{a vital part of}} PedroII's family life and routine. She never filled the roles of romantic lover or {{intellectual}} partner, however. Her devotion to the Emperor remained firm, though she feared being supplanted. She continued to appear with the Emperor in public, and he continued to treat her with respect and consideration. She was not rejected or slighted, but the relationship had changed. Pedro II treated her <b>more</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> close friend and companion than as a wife.|$|E
5|$|The poem is a lyrical {{description}} {{of the life of}} a tribe he was living with along the Amazon river. While it has echoes of Tennyson in the rhymes and rhythms the poem itself is not overly Romantic, serving <b>more</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tool to set the scene and then draw contrast between {{the lives of the people}} living here and those in England. The poem is a comment on savagery and greed, making the point that some in England were more 'savage' than those on the Amazon, either by a greed for gold or by their greed for gold driving others into poverty.|$|E

5|$|The {{restoration}} works {{carried out}} on the fort in 1947 involved addition of a powder magazine, removal of dilapidated parts of the bastions and building an additional wooden building for housing {{the office of the}} governor. The governor’s residence on the ramparts of the fort was also renovated. A prison was also built within the fort, which consisted of four rooms. The refurbished fort was now used <b>more</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> prison than for defending the Kingdom. The cannons were rusting and the fort was mostly empty of personnel except for a few soldiers and the Governor of Maui who lived there.|$|E

5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink <b>more</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E

5|$|As a {{commander}} Marlborough preferred battle over slow moving siege warfare. Aided by an expert staff (particularly his carefully selected aides-de-camp such as Cadogan), {{as well as}} enjoying a close personal relationship with the talented Imperial commander, Prince Eugene, Marlborough proved far-sighted, often far ahead of his contemporaries in his conceptions, and was a master at assessing his enemy's characteristics in battle. Marlborough {{was more likely to}} manoeuvre than his opponents, and was better at maintaining operational tempo at critical times, yet the Duke qualifies <b>more</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> great practitioner within the constraints of early 18th century warfare, rather than as a great innovator who radically redefined military theory. Nevertheless, his predilection for fire, movement, and co-ordinated all-arms attacks, lay at the root of his great battlefield successes.|$|E
5|$|Haydn's {{choice of}} D major for this quartet, {{with the second}} {{movement}} in D minor, optimises the use of open strings and allows for the work to be the loudest and most grandiose of the set. The first movement opens peculiarly: the first violin starts on an E, and proceeds to play a four-measure phrase that concludes with a D major chord. The use of a closing phrase to start the movement {{is the first of}} a number of unsettling incidents in the movement. The exposition withholds the expected cadence to the dominant almost until the exposition ends. And the movement itself has a tentative pianissimo ending that serves <b>more</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> link to the D-minor Adagio than a proper conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Home Army {{relations}} with the Soviet Red Army became increasingly poor {{over the course of}} the war. Not only had the Soviet Union invaded Poland on 17 September 1939, following the German invasion beginning 1 September 1939, but even after the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 the latter saw Polish partisans loyal to the Polish Government in Exile <b>more</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potential obstacle to Soviet plans to take control of postwar Poland, than as a potential ally. On orders from the Soviet Stavka (high command), issued on 22 June 1943, Soviet partisans engaged Polish partisans in combat, and it has been claimed that they attacked the Poles more often than they did the Germans.|$|E

5|$|However, {{there is}} {{a fine line between}} {{aggressiveness}} and over-aggressiveness at takeoff. One of the most common mistakes made by athletes, including those at world class level, is to raise the ski tips too much during the transition. This excessive angle of attack causes the skis to act <b>more</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> spoiler than an efficient aerodynamic device, resulting in more height than distance; a flight curve that is too steep or shallow is unfavourable. In a well-executed jump, athletes will spend several seconds longer in the air than in ski jumping – up to five seconds more – which requires a different level of skill in order to sustain flight for a longer period, and showcases how the role of aerodynamics is magnified in ski flying. Not all athletes who excel in ski jumping are able do so in ski flying (see the section on specialists), and it can be difficult for them to hone their skills in the latter due to the hills being off-limits when competitions are not staged.|$|E
5|$|Imaginos is the {{eleventh}} studio album by the American hard rock band Blue Öyster Cult (commonly shortened as BÖC). It {{was released in}} 1988, and was their last recording with their original record label, CBS/Columbia Records. The album took nearly eight years to complete and was originally intended {{to be the first}} in a trilogy of solo albums by Blue Öyster Cult drummer and songwriter Albert Bouchard. Bouchard was fired in August 1981, and CBS rejected the album in 1984, but a re-worked version was eventually published as a product of the band. Many musicians contributed to the project over this eight-year span, including Joe Satriani and Doors guitarist Robby Krieger, but some band members were barely involved in the recording process. Thus, Imaginos is often considered <b>more</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> project of producer and lyricist Sandy Pearlman than as a true album of the band.|$|E
5|$|In Smallville, Lois {{comes to}} town to {{investigate}} the apparent death of her cousin Chloe Sullivan {{at the start of}} the fourth season. After finding Chloe still alive, Lois is forced to enroll in Smallville High to complete the remaining credits of high school she failed to achieve. As the series progresses, her interest in journalism grows, first writing a couple of articles for the Smallville High Torch in season four, landing a job at the Inquisitor in season six, and finally being hired at the Daily Planet in season seven. Throughout seasons four, five, six and seven, Lois's relationship with Clark Kent is depicted <b>more</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> brother/sister relationship, with the two characters often butting heads. By season eight, Lois begins to realize that she is falling in love with Clark, and by season nine the two become an official couple. During season ten the relationship goes through several milestones and midseason the pair get engaged.|$|E
