40|$|The {{impact of}} a {{sustained}} release <b>metofluthrin</b> emanator and an allethrin-based mosquito coil on biting, movement and mortality of female Aedes aegypti was assessed in an apartment. In the room in which the <b>metofluthrin</b> emanator was activated, mosquito biting counts were reduced to zero. <b>Metofluthrin</b> also had a spillover effect, significantly (P < 0. 001) reducing biting counts in a neighboring room 1, 4, and 24 hours after the emanator was activated when compared with either the coil or control (untreated) treatment. Mosquitoes were neither repelled nor expelled from a room exposed to <b>metofluthrin.</b> Indeed, a significantly (P = 0. 023) greater proportion of mosquitoes {{were found in the}} treated room after exposure to <b>metofluthrin</b> when compared with either the coil or control treatment. Furthermore, in the room treated with <b>metofluthrin</b> the majority of mosquitoes died and a spillover effect into the neighboring room caused greater than one-third mortality of the mosquitoes. <b>Metofluthrin</b> could be used to prevent dengue transmission within a household...|$|E

40|$|A {{study on}} the release of <b>metofluthrin</b> (a {{mosquito}} repellant compound) from a thin film of a cellulosic polymer matrix {{and the effect of}} various factors influencing release was undertaken. Experiments were carried out with <b>metofluthrin</b> impregnated cellulose films, kept {{at the center of a}} room, to primarily determine the effect of four factors on the amount of <b>metofluthrin</b> released in the room: temperature, initial <b>metofluthrin</b> loading in the film, velocity of air and surface area of the film. Modeling was done using unsteady state mass balances, with an assumption that diffusivity of <b>metofluthrin</b> inside the film follows an Arrhenius dependence on temperature, while the mass transfer coefficient from film to air follows a linear dependence on the velocity of air. The model explained all our experimental trends quantitatively. Finally, accuracy of the model was validated by successful prediction of experimental release data of another metofluthrin-impregnated, emanator-system reported in the literature.

40|$|Current malaria {{vector control}} {{programmes}} rely on insecticides with rapid contact toxicity. However, spatial repellents {{can also be}} applied to reduce man-vector contact, which might ultimately impact malaria transmission. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify effects of airborne pyrethroids from coils and DDT used an indoor residual spray (IRS) on entomological parameters that influence malaria transmission. The effect of Transfluthrin and <b>Metofluthrin</b> coils compared to DDT on house entry, exit and indoor feeding behaviour of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato were measured in experimental huts in the field and in the semi-field. Outcomes were deterrence - reduction in house entry of mosquitoes; irritancy or excito-repellency - induced premature exit of mosquitoes; blood feeding inhibition and effect on mosquito fecundity. Transfluthrin coils, <b>Metofluthrin</b> coils and DDT reduced human vector contact through deterrence by 38 %, 30 % and 8 %, respectively and induced half of the mosquitoes to leave huts before feeding (56 %, 55 % and 48 %, respectively). Almost all mosquitoes inside huts with <b>Metofluthrin</b> and Transfluthrin coils and more than three quarters of mosquitoes in the DDT hut did not feed, almost none laid eggs and 67 %, 72 % and 70 % of all mosquitoes collected from Transfluthrin, <b>Metofluthrin</b> and DDT huts, respectively had died after 24 hours. This study highlights that airborne pyrethroids and DDT affect a range of anopheline mosquito behaviours that are important parameters in malaria transmission, namely deterrence, irritancy/excito-repellency and blood-feeding inhibition. These effects are in addition to significant toxicity and reduced mosquito fecundity that affect mosquito densities and, therefore, provide community protection against diseases for both users and non-users. Airborne insecticides and freshly applied DDT had similar effects on deterrence, irritancy and feeding inhibition. Therefore, it is suggested that airborne pyrethroids, if delivered in suitable formats, may complement existing mainstream vector control tools...|$|E

40|$|The Gravid Aedes Trap (GAT) uses {{visual and}} {{olfactory}} cues to attract gravid Aedes aegypti (L.) that are then captured when knocked {{down by a}} residual pyrethroid surface spray. However, the use of surface sprays can be compromised by poor availability of the spray and pesticide resistance in the target mosquito. We investigated several "alternative" insecticide and insecticide-free killing agents {{for use in the}} GAT. This included long-lasting insecticide-impregnated nets (LLINs), vapor-active synthetic pyrethroids (<b>metofluthrin),</b> canola oil, and two types of dry adhesive sticky card. During bench top assays LLINs, <b>metofluthrin,</b> and dry sticky cards had 24 -h knockdown (KD) percentages > 80 % (91. 2 [*]Â±[*] 7. 2 %, 84. 2 [*]Â±[*] 6. 8 %, and 83. 4 [*]Â±[*] 6. 1 %, respectively), whereas the 24 -h KD for canola oil was 70 [*]Â±[*] 7. 7 %, which improved to 90. 0 [*]Â±[*] 3. 7 % over 48 [*]h. Importantly, {{there were no significant differences}} in the number of Ae. aegypti collected per week or the number of traps positive for Ae. aegypti between the sticky card and canola oil treatments compared with the surface spray and LLIN treatments in semifield and field trials. These results demonstrate that the use of inexpensive and widely available insecticide-free agents such as those described in this study are effective alternatives to pyrethroids in regions with insecticide-resistant populations. The use of such environmentally friendly insecticide-free alternatives will also be attractive in areas where there is substantial resistance to insecticide use due to environmental and public health concerns...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Current {{efforts are}} {{underway}} {{to quantify the}} chemical concentration in a treated air space that elicits a spatial repellent (deterrent) response in a vector population. Such information will facilitate identifying the optimum active ingredient (AI) dosage and intervention coverage important {{for the development of}} spatial repellent tools â€“ one of several novel strategies being evaluated for vector-borne disease control. This study reports initial findings from air sampling experiments conducted under field conditions to describe the relationship between air concentrations of repellent AIs and deterrent behavior in the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti. Methods Air samples were taken inside and outdoors of experimental huts located in Pu Tuey Village, Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand in conjunction with mosquito behavioral evaluations. A mark-release-recapture study design using interception traps was used to measure deterrency of Ae. aegypti against 0. 00625 % <b>metofluthrin</b> coils and DDT-treated fabric (2 g/m 2) within separate experimental trials. Sentinel mosquito cohorts were positioned adjacent to air sampling locations to monitor knock down responses to AI within the treated air space. Air samples were analyzed using two techniques: the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Compendium Method TO- 10 A and thermal desorption (TD). Results Both the USEPA TO- 10 A and TD air sampling methods were able to detect and quantify volatized AIs under field conditions. Air samples indicated concentrations of both repellent chemicals below thresholds required for toxic responses (mortality) in mosquitoes. These concentrations elicited up to a 58 % and 70 % reduction in Ae. aegypti entry (i. e., deterrency) into treated experimental huts using <b>metofluthrin</b> coils and DDT-treated fabric, respectively. Minimal knock down was observed in sentinel mosquito cohorts positioned adjacent to air sampling locations during both chemical evaluations. Conclusions This study is the first to describe two air sampling methodologies that are appropriate for detecting and quantifying repellent chemicals within a treated air space during mosquito behavior evaluations. Results demonstrate that the quantity of AI detected by the mosquito vector, Ae. aegypti, that elicits repellency is far lower than that needed for toxicity. These findings have important implications for evaluation and optimization of new vector control tools that function through mosquito behavior modification as opposed to mortality. </p...|$|E
40|$|A randomized, double-blinded, {{placebo-controlled}} {{study was}} conducted to examine the effect of spatial repellent (SR) in households at risk of malaria in Indonesia. Following presumptive radical cure for malaria in 180 adult men representing sentinels of new infection in four clusters within two villages, all households were given either <b>metofluthrin</b> or placebo mosquito coils. Weekly blood smear screening and human-landing mosquito catches were done throughout the 6 months intervention. Malaria infections occurred in 61 subjects living in placebo households and 31 subjects living in SR coil households, suggesting a 52 % protective effect of SR. Likewise, anopheles indoor human landing rates were 32 % lower in homes receiving SR coils. Differences in the malaria attack rate between SR- and placebo-treated homes was significant when not accounting for the effects of clustering. When the analysis was adjusted for intra-cluster correlation, the differences between SR- and placebo-treated homes were not statistically significant. The findings provide evidence of SR public health benefit and support a larger trial statistically powered to detect those effects...|$|E
