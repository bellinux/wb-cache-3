5|$|The novel's delayed {{publication}} was {{a result}} of Balzac's active social life. He spent <b>many</b> <b>nights</b> dining at the homes of friends, including novelist Eugène Sue and his mistress Olympe Pélissier, as well as the feminist writer George Sand and her lover Jules Sandeau. Balzac and Pélissier had a brief affair, and she became the first lover with whom he appeared in public.

In late spring he allowed Sand to read a nearly-finished manuscript; she enjoyed it and predicted it would do well.|$|E

The concept of the frame story dates back to ancient Sanskrit literature, and was introduced into Persian and Arabic literature through the Panchatantra.|$|E

We were forbidden to have food brought to us from outside, and were given disgusting soup cooked with soda ash which kept us {{in a constant state of}} dysentery. We were all in a deplorable state.

Unlike Wright, Fulton had always been on good personal terms with UDA chief Johnny Adair as the two had socialized together on and off since the early 1990s. The alliance was sealed soon afterwards when Mark and Gary Fulton arrived at the Maze prison,ostensibly to visit a friend, but instead sat at Adair's table in the visiting room. Fulton was deeply affected by Wright's death, and reportedly spent <b>many</b> <b>nights</b> alone by his grave.|$|E

[...] "When You Believe" [...] is sung in the film by characters Tzipporah and Miriam, and a chorus of people departing from the slavery of Egypt to the Red Sea and the Promised Land.
