[...] In November 1962, after Nixon's defeat in the California gubernatorial race, Voorhis appeared on Howard K. Smith's [...] program on ABC in the episode entitled [...] "The Political Obituary of Richard M. Nixon" [...] and complained about the way Nixon had conducted himself in the 1946 race. [...] Voorhis's appearance was overshadowed by the controversial participation of Nixon adversary Alger Hiss. [...] In 1972, Voorhis authored a book, The Strange Case of Richard Milhous Nixon, in which he stated that Nixon was [...] "quite a ruthless opponent" [...] whose [...] "one cardinal and unbreakable rule of conduct" [...] was [...] "to win, whatever it takes to do it".

Producer Shep Morgan received a planning grant from the NEH in 1976 and sought input from historians including Robert B. Toplin who suggested the topic of American slavery. When the miniseries Roots was aired in 1977, the team was forced to argue to some television executives that there was <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> American slavery. The first film in the series was Denmark Vesey's Rebellion, about Denmark Vesey, who planned a slave rebellion. The film was aired on PBS in 1982, and Solomon Northup's Odyssey was the next to be produced. Toplin said, [...] "While we hoped the Vesey show would throw light on questions about slave insurrections, we designed the Northup film to address questions about life in bondage." [...] Toplin said the film in particular corrected the tendency of Roots and similar media [...] "to portray almost all slaveholders as insensitive exploiters". Toplin described the various portrayals, [...] " [...] showed an African American working under three different masters. One was a kindly individual whose good intentions were undermined by the slave system. A second master was a vicious, poorly educated individual who was jealous of Northup's intelligence and skills. The third respected Northup but drove him hard nevertheless in order to maximize profits on his plantation." ...|$|E

60|$|So Ernest {{sat down}} once {{more at the}} table by the window, and began to interlard the {{manuscript}} with such allusions to Italy and the Italians as could suggest themselves {{on the spur of}} the moment to his anxious imagination. At the end of half an hour--about the time a practised hand would have occupied in writing the whole article--he counted words once more, and found there were still two hundred wanting. Two hundred <b>more</b> words <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Italian organ-boys! Alas for the untrained human fancy! A master leader writer at the office of the 'Morning Intelligence' could have run on for ever on so fertile and suggestive a theme--a theme pregnant with unlimited openings for all the cheap commonplaces of abstract journalistic philanthropy; but poor Ernest, a 'prentice hand at the trade, had yet to learn the fluent trick of the accomplished news purveyor; he absolutely could not write without thinking about it. A third time he was obliged to recommit his manuscript, and a third time to count the words over. This time, oh joy, the reckoning came out as close as possible to the even fifteen hundred. Ernest gave a sigh of relief, and turned to read it all over again, as finally enlarged and amended, to the critical ears of admiring Edie.|$|R

40|$|Background: AIDS is {{a serious}} problem which affects all aspects of an individual’s life. Affected persons have a fear of being excommunicated or being {{abandoned}} by their family or friends, so they hide their infectious status. This factor causes the infection <b>to</b> spread <b>more</b> easily. Family has a major supportive role for individuals suffering from AIDS and the family support results in promotion of their life quality. Therefore, decreases the spread of the infection. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on all persons infected with HIV in Khorram Abad (147 cases). Infection status of these patients have been approved before May, 2004 and their families aware of their disease. Data gathering tool was a two-part questionnaire including 36 questions, of which 16 questions concerned demographic information and the second part had 20 questions about the rate of family social support, based on standard questionnaire of PSS-F. All questionnaires were filled out at patients’ house. Findings: A majority of subjects (56. 5 %) benefited weak family social support. In addition, family social support from married persons was higher than single ones significantly (P= 0. 01). Rate of condom use in matrimony relations among married patients with more family social support was more frequent. This difference was also significant (P= 0. 04). Patients with higher social support were more aware of the risk of transferring the infection (P= 0. 05) and felt <b>more</b> responsibility <b>to</b> prevent the transfer of infection and notify their problem to others (P= 0. 000). Conclusion: Patients who receive more family social support, are <b>more</b> willing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> their problem <b>to</b> other peoples, and use condom more frequently than other patients in their sexual activities. Since the majority of the studied patients received weak social support, it is recommended to improve and promote their social support by informing and educating their families...|$|R
