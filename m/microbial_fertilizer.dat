40|$|Introduction: {{sustainable}} {{development and the}} environment are interconnected. Sustainable agriculture is continuous utilization of a farm with respect to various aspects of environmental conditions by using fewer inputs (other than Bio-fertilizers). Phosphorus {{is one of the}} essential elements for the plants. Management of soil is possible by using biological fertilizers pillar of sustainable agriculture and providing some of the phosphorus needed by plants via bio-fertilizers. Phosphorus deficiency is extremely effective on the plant growth and productivity. The application of phosphorus fertilizers is expensive and dangerous. In addition, phosphorus in the soilmay become insoluble and will be unavailable to the plants. Studies showed that phosphate solubilizing bacteria in the soil rhizosphere are active and by root exudates solve insoluble phosphates such as tricalcium phosphate, and form absorbable P for plant. Consequently, the use of <b>microbial</b> <b>fertilizers</b> could reduce excessive use of chemical fertilizers and lead to decrease their harmful effects and protect the environment and conservation of available resources. The biological phosphate fertilizer industry uses sugar beet molasses as a binder and drying granules at high temperatures.

40|$|Bacillus safensis {{is one of}} {{phosphate}} solubalizing bacteria (PSB) {{that act}} as plant regulator in plant. Bacteria that abundant in the soil forces recycling the soil nutrient that crucial for soil fertility, induced better rooting development and improving crop production. There are many beneficial effects of PSB on plants that have been described {{but the use of}} PSB as bio-fertilizer in oil palm seedlings is less documented. The ability of Bacillus safensis to improve growth of oil palm seedlings and the effects on P availability in presence of Chritsmas island rock phosphate (ClRP) were carried out in the pot experiment at the Greenhouse, UiTM Jasin. The experiment was arranged in Completely Randomized Design(CRD) with four treatment and three replication. Treatments include seeds that inoculated with Bacillus safensis and presence of ClRP (P-PSB), seeds that not inoculated with Bacillus safensis and presence of CIRP (PWPSB), seeds that inoculated with Bacillus safensis and absence of CIRP (PSB) and control treatment, seeds that not inoculated with Bacillus safensis and absence of CIRP (WPSB). Sterilized seed of oil palm seedlings were planted in polybag containing 1 kg soil and the growth performance of the treatment observed for four weeks of germination. The treated seed with Bacillus safensis significantly increased the height of seedlings (38. 18 em) and improved the roots development compare to non- inoculated treatments. The presence of CIRP in the soil solution increased the P uptake in plants and result in positive effect on seedling growth in respect to average of root length, shoot length, height of seedlings, number of roots and number of leaves. The results showed that inoculation of oil palm seedlings with Bacillus safensis improve phosphate solubilizing activity of incorporated CIRP. The inoculation could improved the growth development of host plant and hence be used as <b>microbial</b> <b>fertilizer</b> in minimized the dependence on chemical fertilizer and providing a sustainable agriculture...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} enhance rooting initiation for oil palm shootlets by using diazotrophic rhizobacteria (locally isolated Acetobacter diazotrophicus (R 12) and Azospirillum brasilense, Sp 7 (ATCC 29729)) and to observe the effects of inoculation on growth of oil palm plantlets under in vitro conditions. The {{experiment was}} {{laid out in a}} completely randomized design with twenty-five replicates and harvested after 60 days of growth (D 60). The observations involved N 2 fixation activities by acetylene reduction assay, root fresh weight (g), primary and secondary root numbers, leaf chlorophyll content and bacteria-root colonization at D 60. Results of the experiment showed that locally isolated A. diazotrophicus (R 12) and A. brasilense (Sp 7), were found to have the potential of inducing root formation of tissue cultured oil palm shoots (Elaeis guineensis Jacq. clone L 295 - 1 / 177 - 1 / 16) and better shoot growth. A. brasilense (Sp 7) could induce better rooting on the in vitro oil palm shoots compared to A. diazotrophicus (R 12). Positive interactions between the bacterial inocula and roots of tissue cultured oil palm plantlets were recorded, which resulted in enhancing growth of the host plants. The plantlets inoculated with Sp 7 showed the highest fresh weight (g) followed by control 1 (MS + NAA), R 12 and Control 2 (Sp 7 k) at D 60. The root fresh weight (g) and number of primary and secondary roots of the inoculated plantlets (Sp 7 and R 12) were also high compared to the controls. The Acetylene Reduction Assay (ARA) indicated the N 2 fixation ability of the diazotrophs (Sp 7 and R 12 could fix up to 0. 965 and 1. 181 μmol C 2 H 4 g - 1 fresh weight h - 1, respectively). The inocula could hence be used as <b>microbial</b> <b>fertilizer</b> for the clonal propagated plantlets of oil palms...|$|E
40|$|Tomato {{bacterial}} wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum {{is one of}} the most destructive soil-borne diseases. Many strategies have been taken to improve soil suppressiveness against this destructive disease, but limited success has been achieved. In this study, a novel bioorganic fertilizer revealed a higher suppressive ability against {{bacterial wilt}} compared with several soil management methods in the field over four growing seasons from March 2011 to July 2013. The application of the bioorganic fertilizer significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced disease incidence of tomato and increased fruit yields in four independent trials. The association among the level of disease incidence, soil physicochemical and biological properties was investigated. The soil treated with the bioorganic fertilizer increased soil pH value, electric conductivity, organic carbon, NH 4 +-N, NO 3 [...] N and available K content, microbial activities and microbial biomass carbon content, which were positively related with soil suppressiveness. Bacterial and actinomycete populations assessed using classical plate counts were highest, whereas R. solanacearum and fungal populations were lowest in soil applied with the bioorganic <b>fertilizer.</b> <b>Microbial</b> community diversity and richness were assessed using denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis profile analysis. The soil treated with the bioorganic fertilizer exhibited higher bacterial community diversity but lower fungal community diversity. Redundancy analysis showed that bacterial community diversity and richness negatively related with bacterial wilt suppressiveness, while fungal community richness positively correlated with R. solanacearum population. We concluded that the alteration of soil physicochemical and biological properties in soil treated with the bioorganic fertilizer induced the soil suppressiveness against tomato bacterial wilt...|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} of virgin desert into oasis farmland creates two contrasting types of land-cover. During oasis formation with irrigation and fertilizer application, however, {{the changes in}} the soil microbial population, which play critical roles in the ecosystem, remain poorly understood. We applied high-throughput pyrosequencing to investigate bacterial and archaeal communities throughout the profile (0 - 3 m) in an experimental field, where irrigation and fertilization began in 1990 and cropped with winter wheat since then. To assess the effects of cultivation, the following treatments were compared with the virgin desert: CK (no fertilizer), PK, NK, NP, NPK, NPKR, and NPKM (R: straw residue; M: manure fertilizer). Irrigation had a greater impact on the overall <b>microbial</b> community than <b>fertilizer</b> application. The greatest impact occurred in topsoil (0 - 0. 2 m), e. g., Cyanobacteria (25 % total abundance) were most abundant in desert soil, while Actinobacteria (26 %) were most abundant in oasis soil. The proportions of extremophilic and photosynthetic groups (e. g., Deinococcus-Thermus and Cyanobacteria) decreased, while the proportions of R-strategy (e. g., Gammaproteobacteria including Xanthomonadales), nitrifying (e. g., Nitrospirae), and anaerobic bacteria (e. g., Anaerolineae) increased throughout the oasis profile. Archaea occurred only in oasis soil. The impact of fertilizer application was mainly reflected in the non-dominant communities or finer taxonomic divisions. Oasis formation led to a dramatic shift in microbial community and enhanced soil enzyme activities. The rapidly increased soil moisture and decreased salt caused by irrigation were responsible for this shift. Furthermore, difference in fertilization and crop growth altered the organic carbon contents in the soil, which resulted in differences of microbial communities within oasis...|$|R
40|$|Willow (Salix spp.) short-rotation coppice (SRC) {{systems on}} {{marginal}} lands are effective at providing carbon (C) neutral bioenergy. However, nitrogen (N) fertilizer application, {{used to enhance}} aboveground biomass productivity, can result in greater soil-derived carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions and negate the C neutrality of the willow biofuels. This study presents the effect of fertilizer application on GHG emissions, soil characteristics, winter freeze-thaw emissions and total annual emissions in willow SRC systems. Mean CO 2 -C emissions were 95. 1 and 111. 0 mg CO 2 -C m- 2 h- 1 in 2014, and 69. 4 and 92. 7 mg CO 2 -C m- 2 h- 1 in 2015, in fertilized and unfertilized treatments, respectively. Soil CO 2 -C emissions exhibited seasonality, with the greatest emissions occurring {{in the summer and}} decreasing in autumn. Elevated summer emissions were due to preferable soil temperature and moisture regimes stimulating microbial respiration, and elevated air temperatures and sunlight availability increasing root respiration. Soils under willow clone SX 67 (Salix miyabeana) consistently emitted more CO 2 -C emissions than clone SV 1 (S. dasyclados), as SX 67 was more efficient at SOC accrual, which is an energy substrate for microbes. Total annual CO 2 emissions were 19. 73 Mg CO 2 ha- 1 yr- 1 from fertilized treatments, and 26. 30 Mg CO 2 ha- 1 yr- 1 from unfertilized treatments. Of this, only 7. 2 and 13. 4 % were derived annually from winter emissions, respectively, and freeze-thaw cycles did not create a pulse of CO 2 emissions. Mean N 2 O-N emissions were 26. 5 and 17. 2 μg N 2 O-N m- 2 h- 1 in 2014, and 22. 9 and 18. 2 μg N 2 O-N m- 2 h- 1 in 2015, from fertilized and unfertilized treatments, respectively. In both years, fertilizer application increased NH 4 + and NO 3 - availability in the soil, resulting in a pulse of N 2 O-N emissions. Thus, elevated N 2 O-N emissions were due to inorganic N availability, which stimulated <b>microbial</b> nitrification following <b>fertilizer</b> application. The fertilizer amendment did not result in a substantial increase in willow biomass yields, which was 10. 24 ± 1. 86 odt ha- 1 in fertilized treatments and 8. 33 ± 0. 97 odt ha- 1 in unfertilized treatments; thus, willow SRC systems exhibited very low N use efficiency. There was no pulse of N 2 O-N following spring thaw events. The willow SRC systems had total annual emissions (expressed as CO 2 equivalents) of 20. 43 Mg CO 2 -eq ha- 1 yr- 1 from fertilized treatments, and 26. 90 Mg CO 2 -eq ha- 1 yr- 1 from unfertilized treatments. N 2 O-N emissions only accounted for 2. 2 to 3. 4 % of total emissions, whereas CO 2 -C emissions accounted for 97. 8 and 96. 6 %. When C sequestration in above and belowground biomass, and litter fall contribution to SOC were quantified, willow SRC systems acted as a C sink in fertilized treatments, with a C sequestration potential of 10. 79 Mg CO 2 -eq ha- 1 yr- 1. Unfertilized treatments acted as a slight C source, with net emissions of 1. 19 Mg CO 2 -eq ha- 1 yr- 1, but may become a C sink as willow SRC systems mature and accrue more C. This thesis proposes that fertilizer application be limited in willow SRC systems, as willows exhibited very low N uptake, to eliminate the annual pulse of N 2 O-N following fertilizer application, but to maintain willow yields at ~ 10 odt ha- 1 and ensure that willow SRC systems are a net C sink. Willow SRC systems are potential C sinks, and can ameliorate atmospheric GHG emissions. This research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of N fertilizer dynamics in willow SRC systems...|$|R
