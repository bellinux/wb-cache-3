5|$|Individuals and {{organizations}} have been reviewing cadmium's bioinorganic aspects for its toxicity. The most dangerous form of occupational exposure to cadmium is inhalation of fine dust and fumes, or ingestion of highly soluble cadmium compounds. Inhalation of cadmium fumes can result initially in <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> <b>fever</b> but may progress to chemical pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, and death.|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide {{itself is}} non-toxic; {{however it is}} {{hazardous}} to inhale zinc oxide fumes, as generated when zinc or zinc alloys are melted and oxidized at high temperature. This problem occurs while melting brass because the melting point of brass {{is close to the}} boiling point of zinc. Exposure to zinc oxide in the air, which also occurs while welding galvanized (zinc plated) steel, can result in a nervous malady called <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> <b>fever.</b> For this reason, typically galvanized steel is not welded, or the zinc is removed first.|$|E
25|$|Zinc {{chloride}} {{is extremely}} {{detrimental to the}} lungs, and pulmonary exposure to zinc chloride smoke resulted in ten fatalities. Inhalation of fumes of zinc, zinc oxide, or zinc chloride leads to pulmonary edema and <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> <b>fever.</b> Onset occurs within 4–6 h and may be delayed up to 8 h. Symptoms include rapid breathing, dyspnea, cough, fever, shivering, sweating, chest and leg pain, myalgias, fatigue, metallic taste, salivation, thirst, and leukocytosis, which can last from 24 to 48 h. In cases of fume inhalation, cortisone preparations should be applied immediately (e.g., by inhalation of Auxiloson) to avoid development of lung edema.|$|E

50|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>fume</b> <b>fever</b> {{is due to}} the {{inhalation}} {{of certain}} metals, either as fine dust or most commonly as fumes.

The effects of particularly toxic compounds, such as nickel carbonyl, are not considered merely <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> <b>fever.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Inhalation of {{magnesium}} oxide fumes can cause <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> <b>fever.</b>|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis is {{primarily}} anecdotal, that is, {{it depends upon}} a good occupational history. Diagnosis of <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> <b>fever</b> can be easily missed because the complaints are non-specific, resemble {{a number of other}} common illnesses, and presentation occurs typically 1-4 days after the exposure. When respiratory symptoms are prominent, <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> <b>fever</b> may be confused with acute bronchitis or pneumonia. The diagnosis is based primarily upon a history of exposure to metal oxide fumes. Cain and Fletcher (2010) report a case of <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> <b>fever</b> that was diagnosed only by taking a full occupational history and by close collaboration between primary and secondary health care personnel.|$|E

40|$|Background: National {{analyses}} of mortality in England and Wales have repeatedly shown excess deaths from pneumonia in welders. During 1979 - 90 the excess was attributable largely to deaths from lobar pneumonia and pneumonias other than bronchopneumonia, limited to men of working age and apparent in other occupations with exposure to <b>metal</b> <b>fumes.</b> The findings for 1991 - 2000 were assessed and {{compared with the}} mortality pattern from asthma in occupations exposed to known respiratory sensitisers. Methods: The Office of National Statistics supplied data on deaths by underlying cause among men aged 16 - 74 years in England and Wales during 1991 - 2000, including age and last held occupation. Data were abstracted on pneumonia for occupations with exposure to <b>metal</b> <b>fumes</b> and on asthma for occupations commonly reported to surveillance schemes as at risk of occupational asthma. The expected numbers of deaths were estimated by applying age-specific proportions of deaths by cause in the population to the total deaths by age in each occupational group. Observed and expected numbers were compared for each cause of death. Results: Among men of working age in occupations with exposure to <b>metal</b> <b>fumes</b> there was excess mortality from pneumococcal and lobar pneumonia (54 deaths vs 27. 3 expected) and from pneumonias other than bronchopneumonia (71 vs 52. 4), but no excess from these causes at older ages or from bronchopneumonia at any age. The attributable mortality from <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> exposure was 45. 3 excess deaths compared with an estimated 62. 6 deaths from occupational asthma. Conclusion: Exposure to <b>metal</b> <b>fumes</b> is a material cause of occupational mortality. The hazard deserves far more attention than it presently receives...|$|R

5000|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> <b>fever</b> involves rapid {{adaptation to the}} development of the syndrome following repeated metal oxide exposure. Workers with a history of recurrent <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> <b>fever</b> often develop a tolerance to the fumes. This tolerance, however, is transient, and only persists through the work week.

40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that inhalation of <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> reversibly increases susceptibility to pneumonia, the authors conducted a case-control study. Men aged 20 – 64 years, admitted to 11 hospitals in West Midlands, England, with community-acquired pneumonia during 1996 – 1999 were interviewed about their lifetime occupational history, exposure to <b>metal</b> <b>fume,</b> and potential confounding factors. Similar information was collected from controls admitted to the same hospitals with nonrespiratory illness. For cases, exposures were timed relative to the onset of their illness (on average, 6 months before interview). Exposure histories for controls were censored 6 months before interview. Interviews were completed by 525 cases and 1, 122 controls (response rates of 74 % and 99 %). Pneumonia was associated with reported occupational exposure to <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> {{in the previous year}} (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1. 6, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 1, 2. 4) but not in earlier periods (OR = 1. 1). The risk was highest for lobar pneumonia and recent exposure to ferrous fume (OR = 2. 3, 95 % CI: 1. 2, 4. 3). The association was not specific to any one microorganism. These findings support {{the hypothesis that}} ferrous and possibly other <b>metal</b> <b>fumes</b> reversibly predispose to infectious pneumonia. Research should now focus on the underlying mechanisms and prevention. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Porous {{polyurethane}} foam was evaluated {{as a potential}} replacement substrate for the eight nylon meshes currently {{being used in the}} diffusion stage of the Nanoparticle Respiratory Deposition (NRD) Sampler. A semi-empirical particle deposition model and preliminary tests were used to select the dimensions of foam substrate needed to match the collection of the NRD sampler at recommended sampling conditions. The foam substrate consisted of a cylinder nominally 25 -mm diameter by 40 mm in depth, housed in a conductive plastic cassette cowl (internal diameter of 23 mm) compatible with the existing NRD sampler. Pristine foam was evaluated for metals content via acid-assisted microwave digestion and inductively coupled plasma-optical emissions spectroscopy (ICP-OES) chemical analysis. Foam collection efficiency was evaluated using salt (NaCl) and <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> test aerosols in independent tests. Foam collection efficiency was compared to the nanoparticulate matter (NPM) criterion (established to reflect the total deposition in the human respiratory system for particles smaller than 300 nm) and theoretical modeling. The collection efficiency of NaCl particles was similar to the NPM criterion (R 2 = 0. 98) and the model underestimated the experimental efficiency (R 2 = 0. 38). Increased collection efficiency of <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> was observed for particles larger than 70 nm presumably due to increased interception effects of fractal shaped particles. The pressure drop across the pristine foam was 1 / 12 th that of the nylon meshes. Foam and nylon meshes were loaded with <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> particles to evaluate performance under simulated field conditions. Changes in collection efficiency and pressure drop were used as measures of performance. Foam had substantially lower changes in collection efficiency and pressure drop with ~ 19 mg <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> loaded compared to the nylon meshes with ~ 3 mg <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> loaded...|$|R

However, trace <b>metal</b> <b>fumes</b> may not always be effectively collected by these devices because the formed fumes are extremely small. The proposed research is to explore the opportunities for improved control of toxic trace metal emissions, alternatively, at the hot-end of the coal combustion process, i. e., in the combustion chamber.

40|$|Increased {{mortality}} from infectious pneumonia after {{occupational exposure}} to inorganic dust, <b>metal</b> <b>fumes</b> and chemicals Kjell Torén, 1, 2 Ingemar Qvarfordt, 2 Ingvar A Bergdahl, 3 Bengt Järvholm 3 Objectives There are epidemiological studies indicating {{that exposure to}} <b>metal</b> <b>fumes</b> is {{a risk factor for}} infectious pneumonia. Whether occupational exposure to other agents, such as inorganic dust or chemicals, also increases the risk for infectious pneumonia is not clear. The aim {{of the present study was}} to elucidate whether occupational exposure to respiratory pollutants and irritants increases the risk for infectious pneumonia. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Swedish male construction workers. Participants 320 143 male construction workers exposed to inorganic dust (asbestos, man-made mineral fibres, dust from cement, concrete and quartz), wood dust, <b>metal</b> <b>fumes</b> and chemicals (organic solvents, diisocyanates and epoxi resins) or unexposed. Main outcome measures The cohort was followed from 1971 to 2003 and the main outcome measures were mortality to infectious pneumonia, lobar pneumonia or pneumococcal pneumonia. RRs were obtained by the person-years method and from Poisson regression models, adjusting for baseline values of age and smoking habits. Results Among men aged 20 e 64 years there was increased mortality from infectious pneumonias among construction workers exposed to <b>metal</b> <b>fumes</b> (RR 2. 31, 95 % CI 1. 35 to 3. 95), inorganic dust (RR 1. 87, 95 % CI 1. 22 to 2. 87) and chemicals (RR 1. 91, 95 % CI 1. 37 to 3. 22). The mortality was also increased from both lobar pneumonia and pneumococcal pneumonia. Among men aged 65 e 84 years the occupational exposure to inorganic dust and chemicals was associated with slightly increased mortality from infectious pneumonia. Among groups with mutually exclusive exposures there was increased mortality from infectious pneumonias among construction workers exposed to inorganic dust, but not among those exposed to wood dust or chemicals. There were no cases among workers exposed only to <b>metal</b> <b>fumes.</b> Conclusions Our findings indicate that exposure to inorganic dust increases the mortality from infectious pneumonias, especially lobar pneumonia and pneumococcal pneumonia. The mechanism is unclear, but the effect may be mediated through induced airways inflammation...|$|R

40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> promotes a reversible {{increase in the}} risk of pneumonia, but by mechanisms which are unclear. To investigate, the current authors measured various markers of host defence function in welders and nonwelders. Induced sputum and venous blood samples were collected from 27 welders with regular longterm {{exposure to}} ferrous <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> and 31 unexposed matched controls. In sputum, the present authors measured cell counts, the soluble and cellular iron concentration, and levels of interleukin- 8, tumour necrosis factor-a, myeloperoxidase, matrix metalloproteinase- 9, immunoglobulin (Ig) A, a 2 -macroglobulin and unsaturated iron-binding capacity. Blood samples were assayed for evidence of neutrophil activation and pneumococcal IgG antibodies. Welders had significantly higher iron levels and a substantially lower unsaturated iron-binding capacity in their sputum, but, despite a high iron challenge, there was a noteworthy absence of an inflammatory response. Only blood counts of eosinophils and basophils were significantly related to the extent of welding. Weak nonsignificant trends were observed for several other measures, consistent with low-grade priming of neutrophils. In conclusion, these data suggest that chronic exposure to <b>metal</b> <b>fume</b> blunts responsiveness to inhaled particulate matter. However, the mechanism behind the lack of detectable local inflammatory response requires further investigation...|$|R
