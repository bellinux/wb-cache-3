By using this approach the author tries to deconstruct stereotypical understanding of migration as a threat or a security hazard for the accepting society, on the contrary she tries to picture <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> and their life-stories as tales of people who consider Czech Republic their second home and who actively participate on its development. Citizenship is understood as a membership in society of which <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> are also legitimate and active members. The thesis should contribute to building positive attitude towards <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> in general and it also offers recommendations for the public as well as integration policy creators as to how <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> can be reflected in context of migration...|$|R

The analysis compares the distinctions made about <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> by ‘native’ Italian <b>women</b> and by <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> themselves, along the dimensions of ‘moral’ and ‘cultural’ boundaries. The article demonstrates the analytical purchase of boundary-work in disentangling the distinctions that underpin processes of inclusion and exclusion, and the construction of self and other.

40|$|Our {{objectives}} were {{to determine whether}} <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> in Western industrialized countries have higher odds of inadequate prenatal care (PNC) compared to receiving-country women and to summarize factors {{that are associated with}} inadequate PNC among <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> in these countries. We conducted searches of electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO), reference lists, known experts, and an existing database of the Reproductive Outcomes And Migration international research collaboration for articles published between January, 1995 and April, 2010. Title and abstract review and quality appraisal were conducted independently by 2 reviewers using established criteria, with consensus achieved through discussion. In this systematic review of 29 studies, the majority of studies demonstrated that <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> were more likely to receive inadequate PNC than receiving-country women, with most reporting moderate to large effect sizes. Rates of inadequate PNC among <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> varied widely by country of birth. Only three studies explored predictors of inadequate PNC among <b>migrant</b> <b>women.</b> These studies found that inadequate PNC among <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> was associated with being less than 20 years of age, multiparous, single, having poor or fair language proficiency, education less than 5 years, an unplanned pregnancy, and not having health insurance. We concluded that <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> as a whole {{were more likely to have}} inadequate PNC and the magnitude of this risk differed by country of origin. Few studies addressed predictors of PNC utilization in <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> and this limits our ability to provide effective PNC in this population. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This thesis aims at investigating what motivates <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> into entrepreneurship in Dublin, Ireland and the challenges they encounter in the operation of their businesses. <b>Migrant</b> <b>women</b> entrepreneurs originating from {{different parts of the world}} were involved in the study.

In addition, the model of psychological perspective of entrepreneurship as well as Schumpeter and Kirzner’s entrepreneurship theory were used for the theoretical framework. The outcome of the study shows that the most prevalent challenges <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> entrepreneurs encounter is the issue of access to information and financial capital. This research reinforces a need for policymakers to provide information of programmes tailored specifically for <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> entrepreneurs, as overall, it is evident that they are ignorant of vital information regarding entrepreneurship in Dublin, Ireland...|$|R

40|$|This article investigates {{empowerment}} {{in relation}} to money-earning activities {{in the context of}} rural-to-urban <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> in poor families in Turkey. Acknowledging the exploitative character of employment accessible to <b>migrant</b> <b>women,</b> it asks whether working <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> gain something in their families in return for their economic contributions. The article points to the traditional role of men as the heads of the family and family honor (namus) as the cultural basis which acts against the empowerment of <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> in Turkish society. It attempts to understand empowerment as articulated by the women themselves based upon their lived experiences. While doing so, it examines women's positions in the family with regard to their role in the intra-family decision making, their degree of control over their earned money, and male violence in the family. It further discusses whether or not the experiences of <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> can be considered as empowerment, and in this way it aims to contribute to the theoretical development of the concept "empowerment" © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|This novel {{deals with}} the ‘migrant experience’ as seen {{through the eyes of}} a young Indian woman, who has, through choice and circumstance, become the {{displaced}} ‘other’ in white Anglo-Saxon Australia.

In the novel, and in the essay that follows, I hope to highlight my concerns with migrant females, rape within families and within cultures and how these issues are discussed in contemporary Australia. The narrative strategy of the novel is a limited first person point of view, with occasional ‘breaks’ and forays into the minds of other characters.

Of these, 18. 4 % RHWs and 58. 3 % CSWs reported ever tried smoking and 3. 2 % RHWs and 41. 9 % CSWs reported current smoking. Participants who first tried smoking after moving to the city {{were more likely to}} be current smokers compared to participants who first tried smoking before moving to the city (25. 3 % vs. 13. 8 % among RHWs, p = 0. 02; 83. 6 % vs. 58. 6 % among CSWs, p = < 0. 01).
