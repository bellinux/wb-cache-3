40|$|Purpose We {{determined}} {{the feasibility of}} substituting sitagliptin or <b>mitiglinide</b> for bolus insulin injection therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods 60 patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled and randomized to switch from mealtime dosing of a rapid-acting insulin analog to either sitagliptin or <b>mitiglinide</b> for 16  weeks. Results Body weight, body mass index, and waist circumference decreased significantly in both groups {{at the end of}} the study. <b>Mitiglinide</b> significantly increased fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels {{at the end of the}} study from 146. 5 ± 36. 3 to 168. 0 ± 38. 8  mg/dL, whereas sitagliptin did not affect FPG. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) and 1, 5 -anhydroglucitol increased significantly in both groups. The C peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) responses after arginine were diminished in both groups. γ-GTP and triglycerides increased, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and adiponectin decreased, in the sitagliptin group, but not in the <b>mitiglinide</b> group. Mean Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire scores improved significantly in both groups. Patients whose mean total daily doses of rapid-acting insulin analog were 16. 6 and 17. 8  units were switched to sitagliptin and <b>mitiglinide,</b> respectively, without a change in the HbA 1 c level. Total insulin doses/body weight predicted changes in HbA 1 c only in the sitagliptin group, but not in the <b>mitiglinide</b> group. Use of > 0. 27  IU/kg of a rapid-acting insulin analog predicted an increase in HbA 1 c after switching to sitagliptin. The CPR index (CPI) was also a predictor for a change in HbA 1 c in the sitagliptin group, but not in the <b>mitiglinide</b> group; patients with a CPI< 1. 4 developed a worse HbA 1 c after switching to sitagliptin. Conclusions Sitagliptin may predominantly act on FPG, whereas <b>mitiglinide</b> may act on postprandial plasma glucose to achieve glycemic control after switching from a bolus insulin regimen. Additional therapy to sitagliptin or <b>mitiglinide</b> is clearly required to obtain equivalent glycemic control in patients using a higher dose of insulin...|$|E
40|$|Hypoglycaemia-inducing sulphonylureas, such as glibenclamide, inhibit cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channels. In search of modulators of CFTR, we investigated {{the effects of}} the non-sulphonylurea hypoglycaemic agents meglitinide, repaglinide, and <b>mitiglinide</b> (KAD- 1229) on CFTR Cl− channels in excised inside-out membrane patches from C 127 cells expressing wild-type human CFTR. When added to the intracellular solution, meglitinide and <b>mitiglinide</b> inhibited CFTR Cl− currents with half-maximal concentrations of 164 ± 19 [*]μM and 148 ± 36 [*]μM, respectively. However, repaglinide only weakly inhibited CFTR Cl− currents. To understand better how non-sulphonylurea hypoglycaemic agents inhibit CFTR, we studied single channels. Channel blockade by both meglitinide and <b>mitiglinide</b> was characterized by flickery closures and a significant decrease in open probability (Po). In contrast, repaglinide was without effect on either channel gating or Po, but caused a small decrease in single-channel current amplitude. Analysis of the dwell time distributions of single channels indicated that both meglitinide and <b>mitiglinide</b> greatly decreased the open time of CFTR. Mitiglinide-induced channel closures were about 3 -fold longer than those of meglitinide. Inhibition of CFTR by meglitinide and <b>mitiglinide</b> was voltage-dependent: at positive voltages channel blockade was relieved. The data demonstrate that non-sulphonylurea hypoglycaemic agents inhibit CFTR. This indicates that these agents have a wider specificity of action than previously recognized. Like glibenclamide, non-sulphonylurea hypoglycaemic agents may inhibit CFTR by occluding the channel pore and preventing Cl− permeation...|$|E
40|$|Sulfonylurea and glinide drugs, {{commonly}} used for antidiabetes therapies, {{are known to}} stimulate insulin release from pancreatic -cells by closing ATP-sensitive K+ channels. However, the specific actions of these drugs on insulin granule motion are largely unknown. Here, we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to analyze the docking and fusion of single insulin granules in live -cells exposed to either the sulfonylurea drug glibenclamide or the glinide drug <b>mitiglinide.</b> TIRF images showed that both agents caused rapid fusion of newcomer insulin granules with the cell membrane in both control and diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat pancreatic -cells. However, {{in the context of}} -cells from sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR 1) knockout mice, TIRF images showed that only <b>mitiglinide,</b> but not glibenclamide, caused fusion of newcomer insulin granules. Compositely, our data indicate that 1) the mechanism by which both sulfonylurea and glinide drugs promote insulin release entails the preferential fusion of newcomer, rather than previously docked, insulin granules, and that 2) <b>mitiglinide</b> can induce insulin release by a mechanism independent of <b>mitiglinide</b> binding to SUR 1...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the mechanism of action of the novel anti-diabetic agent <b>mitiglinide</b> (S 21403) on Kir 6. 2 /SUR 1, Kir 6. 2 /SUR 2 A and Kir 6. 2 /SUR 2 B types of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel. These possess a common pore-forming subunit, Kir 6. 2, and different regulatory sulphonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. It is believed that they correspond to native KATP channels in pancreatic β-cells, heart and non-vascular smooth muscle, respectively. Kir 6. 2 was coexpressed with SUR 1, SUR 2 A or SUR 2 B in Xenopus oocytes and macroscopic currents were recorded in giant inside-out membrane patches. <b>Mitiglinide</b> {{was added to the}} intracellular membrane surface. <b>Mitiglinide</b> inhibited Kir 6. 2 /SUR currents at two sites: a low-affinity site on Kir 6. 2 and a high-affinity site on SUR.

40|$|Abstract The risk of {{cardiovascular}} complication in a diabetes patient {{is similar to}} that in a nondiabetic patient with a history of myocardial infarction. Although intensive control of glycemia achieved by conventional antidiabetic agents decreases microvascular complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy, no marked effect has been reported on macrovascular complications or all-cause mortality. Evidence from VADT, ACCORD, and ADVANCE would suggest that glycemic control has little effect on macrovascular outcomes. Moreover, in the case of ACCORD, intensive glycemic control may be associated with an increased risk of mortality. There is sufficient evidence that suggests that postprandial hyperglycemia may be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in diabetes patients. However, there are no prospective clinical trials supporting the recommendation that lowering postprandial blood glucose leads to lower risk {{of cardiovascular}} outcomes. <b>Mitiglinide</b> is a short-acting insulinotropic agent used in type 2 diabetes treatment. It has a rapid stimulatory effect on insulin secretion and reduces postprandial plasma glucose level in patients with type 2 diabetes. Because of its short action time, it is unlikely to exert adverse effects related to hypoglycemia {{early in the morning and}} between meals. <b>Mitiglinide</b> reduces excess oxidative stress and inflammation, plays a cardioprotective role, and improves postprandial metabolic disorders. Moreover, <b>mitiglinide</b> add-on therapy with pioglitazone favorably affects the vascular endothelial function in type 2 diabetes patients. These data suggest that <b>mitiglinide</b> plays a potentially beneficial role in the improvement of postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes patients and can be used to prevent cardiovascular diseases. Although the results of long-term, randomized, placebo-controlled trials for determining the cardiovascular effects of <b>mitiglinide</b> on clinical outcomes are awaited, this review is aimed at summarizing substantial insights into this topic. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} effect of <b>mitiglinide</b> {{combined}} laser photocoagulation on blood glucose, blood lipid and vascular endothelial function in diabetic retinopathy. Methods: A total of 106 patients with diabetic retinopathy treated in our hospital from January 2014 to January 2015 were selected and assigned into the separate group and combined group. Fiftythree patients in the separate group only received oral mitiginide, while other 53 patients in the combined group received oral <b>mitiglinide</b> and laster photocoagulation surgery. Before and after treatment, the FBG, 2 hPBG, HbA 1 c, TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, ET- 1, VEGF, PEDF, ICAM- 1, FMD of patients {{in the two groups}} were analyzed. Results: After treatment, the blood glucose and blood lipid indexes of patients in the two groups were improved significantly, and there was no statistical difference between the two groups. The ET- 1, ICAM- 1 and VEGF of patients in the two groups decreased, and the decrease of the combined group was more distinctly. The PEDF and FMD in the two groups all increased, and the combined group changed more obviously. The regression of the blood vessel and the recovery of visual acuity in the combined group were better than the separate group. Conclusions: <b>Mitiglinide</b> combined with laser photocoagulation can effectively improve the level of blood glucose and blood lipid, promote vascular endothelial function and inhibit the formation of retinal neovascularization so as to improve the visual acuity level...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} currently affectsmore than 220 {{million people}} world-wide. 1 The prevalence of this chronic disease {{is expected to}} double by the year 2030, due mainly to the rapid increase in obesity and physical inactivity. 1, 2 Al-though there is good evidence that {{a large proportion of}} cases of diabetes and its complications can be prevented by a healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight, and avoiding tobacco, this evidence is not widely implemented. 1, 2 Since many pa-tients do not follow recommendations for lifestyle modification, drug therapy is usually required to meet therapeutic goals and prevent long-term complica-tions associated with diabetes. Cardiovascular disorders such as heart disease, stroke, and hypertension frequent-ly occur in patients with diabetes. Accord-ing to the findings of several large-scale clinical studies, postprandial hyper-glycemia was found to be an independent risk factor for arteriosclerosis and cardio-vascular complications. 3, 4 Additionally, the Study To Prevent Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (STOP-NIDDM) trial demonstrated that improvement in post-prandial hyperglycemia delayed the onset of cardiovascular events, limited the pro-gression of diabetes, and prevented the on-set of macrovascular diseases. 5 In light of these studies, it would seem essential that the therapeutic management of di-abetes should target postprandial hyperglycemia.

An association between the postprandial metabolic state and atherogenesis has been observed in patients {{with diabetes}} mellitus. In the Study to Prevent Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (STOP-NIDDM), treatment with an α-glucosidase inhibitor (α-GI) in patients with impaired glucose tolerance not only reduced the rate of conversion from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM), but was also associated with a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events. These results suggested the importance of treating postprandial hyperglycemia {{in the early stages of}} T 2 DM. Glinides are rapid and short-acting insulin secretagogues that bind to the sulfonylurea receptors on pancreatic β-cells to facilitate rapid insulin secretion, restore postprandial early insulin secretion, and reduce the postprandial glucose spike. Moreover, α-GIs reduce postprandial hyperglycemia and insulin secretion by delaying the digestion of carbohydrates and polysaccharides in the small intestine. Then, both glinides and α-GI have beneficial effects for treating patients with T 2 DM and impaired glucose tolerance. Considering the ameliorating effects of these drugs on postprandial metabolic disorders, combinations of glinides and α-GI might constitute a promising therapeutic strategy for managing patients with T 2 DM, and also appear to be suitable for Japanese people, who consume more carbohydrates, such as polished rice, than Caucasians. It has recently been reported that combined use of <b>mitiglinide</b> and voglibose reduces postprandial insulin secretion and blunts diurnal glycemic changes in T 2 DM patients. This therapy can thus be regarded as being suitable for achieving strict postprandial glycemic control. In this report, we outline the effects of this combination therapy on postprandial plasma glucose and assess its safety.

40|$|Measuring {{changes in}} β-cell mass in vivo during {{progression}} of diabetes mellitus {{is important for}} understanding the pathogenesis, facilitating early diagnosis, and developing novel therapeutics for this disease. However, a non-invasive method has not been developed. A novel series of <b>mitiglinide</b> derivatives (o-FMIT, m-FMIT and p-FMIT; FMITs) were synthesized and their binding affinity for the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR 1) of pancreatic islets were evaluated by inhibition studies. (+) -(S) -o-FMIT had the highest affinity of our synthesized FMITs (IC 50 = 1. 8 μM). (+) -(S) -o-[(18) F]FMIT was obtained with radiochemical yield of 18 % by radiofluorination of racemic precursor 7, hydrolysis, and optical resolution with chiral HPLC; its radiochemical purity was > 99 %. In biodistribution experiments using normal mice, (+) -(S) -o-[(18) F]FMIT showed 1. 94 ± 0. 42 % ID/g of pancreatic uptake at 5 min p. i., and decreases in radioactivity in the liver (located close to the pancreas) was relatively rapid. Ex vivo autoradiography experiments using pancreatic sections confirmed accumulation of (+) -(S) -o-[(18) F]FMIT in pancreatic β-cells.

40|$|S 21403 (<b>mitiglinide)</b> is a {{new drug}} for type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM). Its action on insulin release and biosynthesis was investigated in several experimental systems utilizing pancreas from normal and T 2 DM animals. At high concentrations (10 [*]μM), S 21403, like classical sulphonylurea, induced insulin release {{in the absence of}} glucose. In contrast, at therapeutic (0. 1 – 1. 0 [*]μM) concentrations, S 21403 amplified insulin secretion glucose dose-dependently and with similar magnitude in normal and diabetic GK rat islets. In perfused GK rat pancreas, S 21403 induced normal kinetics of insulin secretion including first-phase response. The effect of S 21403 was strongly modulated by physiological factors. Thus, 0. 1 [*]μM adrenaline inhibited S 21403 -induced insulin release. There was marked synergism between S 21403 and arginine in GK rat islets, combination of the two normalizing insulin secretion. In primary islet cultures from normal rats or prediabetic Psammomys obesus, prolonged exposure to S 21403 did not induce further depletion of insulin stores under normal or ‘glucotoxic' conditions. Proinsulin biosynthesis was not affected by 2 -h exposure of rat or prediabetic P. obesus islets to 1 [*]μM S 21403. Yet, 24 -h exposure of rat islets to S 21403 resulted in 30 % increase in proinsulin biosynthesis at 8. 3 [*]mM glucose. Amplification by S 21403 of glucose-induced insulin secretion in diabetic GK β-cells with restoration of first-phase response, a strong synergistic interaction with arginine and marked inhibition by adrenaline, make it a prime candidate for successful oral antidiabetic agent...|$|E
30|$|Case 1 : A 76 -year-old female with {{a history}} of slowly {{progressive}} type 1 diabetes, treated for 30  years. She was being treated for rheumatoid arthritis (oral prednisolone, 5  mg/day, and had poor glycemic control specified by a glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) level of 7.8 % while on a regimen of 50 % insulin lispro protamine suspension and 50 % insulin lispro injection (HUMALOG® Mix 50 / 50 TM; Lilly USA, LLC, 2013) at 6 U in the morning and 4 U in the evening, as well as miglitol (10  mg/day) and <b>mitiglinide</b> (450  mg/day). She presented to the emergency unit of our hospital with a fever of 39 °C, headache, erythema on the trunk, and joint pain. On admission, her body temperature was 40.2 °C, pulse rate 134 beats/min, blood pressure 150 / 70  mmHg, height 145  cm, and body weight 38  kg. Routine laboratory testing showed an elevated leukocyte count of 11.8 [*]×[*] 103 cells/μL and a C-reactive protein level of 19.21  mg/dL. Serological tests for syphilis and HIV were negative. As a result, we suspected a bacterial infection, especially because of the significant inflammation reaction in blood sampling; therefore, we decided to begin empiric cefepime therapy at 2  g/day. During hospitalization, our patient complained of a decreased appetite; thus, we commenced blood glucose monitoring on a sliding scale to maintain her preprandial blood glucose level at approximately 120  mg/dL. On day 2 of admission, her fever declined and erythema improved. On day 4, she was discharged after a change to oral cefotiam at 1800  mg/day. On day 9, she again developed high fever, poor appetite, and fatigue, and on day 10, she was readmitted to our hospital. On the same day, H. cinaedi was detected from a blood culture taken {{on the first day of}} admission; we accordingly started administering minocycline at 200  mg/day. A blood culture taken on the second day of re-admission was positive for H. cinaedi, indicating persistent bacteremia. However, because her general condition was improving, oral minocycline (200  mg/day) was continued. On day 18 after the initial admission, the third blood culture was taken, then she was discharged a second time. Later, we confirmed that her third blood culture was negative in an outpatient clinic and prescribed completion of the antibiotic regimen.|$|E
