5|$|The ballots {{from abroad}} that were {{considered}} potentially contentious {{before the election}} proved to have very {{little effect on the}} result. While Peterle received <b>more</b> <b>votes</b> from abroad than Türk, both the total number of votes and the difference was smaller than expected (3693 for Peterle and 3040 for Türk).|$|E
5|$|After the announcement, {{the ballot}} results were published: London {{gathered}} <b>more</b> <b>votes</b> in the first, {{third and final}} rounds, while Madrid won the second round despite falling short on votes {{in the third round}} and being eliminated. The competitiveness of the bids from Paris and London was ultimately demonstrated by a four-vote difference in the final round.|$|E
5|$|Both {{candidates}} received {{financial support}} from outside the district, some of which was used to buy votes or bribe voters to stay home. Breckinridge received several thousand dollars, with a substantial amount coming from Washington, D.C. banker William Wilson Corcoran; estimates of Letcher's support ranged from $30,000 to $100,000. Breckinridge won the canvass by 526 votes and received 71% {{of the vote in}} Owen County, which recorded 123 <b>more</b> <b>votes</b> than registered voters.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Johnson was one {{of three}} contenders for the Democratic {{nomination}} for lieutenant governor. In the primary, he received <b>more</b> <b>votes</b> than his opponents, J. E. Wise and B. F. Wright, but a newly enacted election law required a runoff if no candidate received a majority. On September 7, Johnson defeated Wise in the runoff.|$|E
5|$|On February 6, 2010, the Pennsylvania Democratic Party {{overwhelmingly}} endorsed U.S. Senator Arlen Specter at the Democratic State Committee's annual endorsement convention, {{which was}} held in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. He received <b>more</b> <b>votes</b> than Joe Sestak, winning more than 77% of the Pennsylvania Democratic State Committee members vote, far {{in excess of the}} 2/3 threshold needed to claim the endorsement. Sestak, however, {{went on to win the}} Democratic primary nomination on May 18.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{finished}} {{in third place}} on Election Day, far behind Dukakis and the victorious George H.W. Bush. He received 431,750 votes, which made up 0.47% of the overall vote. He received 203,639 <b>more</b> <b>votes</b> than the Bergland/Lewis ticket four years prior. The largest percentage won by Paul came in Alaska, where he received 2.74%. In Washington, he missed his goal of 5% with a 0.92% showing. In Utah, Paul received 1.16%.|$|E

5|$|The NBA began {{offering}} All-Star ballots in three languages—English, Spanish and Chinese—for fan voting of the starters for the 2003 NBA All-Star Game. Yao was voted to {{start for the}} West over O'Neal, who was coming off three consecutive NBA Finals MVP Awards. Yao received nearly a quarter million <b>more</b> <b>votes</b> than O'Neal, and {{he became the first}} rookie to start in the All-Star Game since Grant Hill in 1995.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Harrison {{moved to}} Ohio, {{where he was}} elected to the United States House of Representatives. In 1824, the state {{legislature}} elected him to the United States Senate. He served a truncated term after being appointed as Minister Plenipotentiary to Gran Colombia in May 1828. In Santa Fe de Bogotá, he spoke with president Simón Bolívar, urging Bolívar to guide his nation toward American-style democracy. Harrison returned to private life on his farm in Ohio until he was nominated for the presidency as one of several Whig Party candidates in the election of 1836. He received <b>more</b> <b>votes</b> than any other Whig, but was defeated by Democrat Martin Van Buren, and returned again to his farm.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} a tie, the song that has {{received}} <b>more</b> <b>votes</b> from the public receives the higher position. There have been two ties for {{first place in the}} history of the contest. In 1969, Tommy Körberg tied for first place with Jan Malmsjö. The juries them voted for their favourite out the two, leading to Tommy Körberg winning. In 1978, Björn Skifs tied for first place with Lasse Holm and Wizex (performing together); a similar tie-break process resulting in Skifs winning.|$|E

5000|$|During the 1999 {{season the}} twist of [...] "The Black Vote" [...] was introduced. During the merge {{portion of the}} {{competition}} whenever someone was voted out before they left tribal council they would cast one <b>more</b> <b>vote.</b> This vote would then be carried over to the next tribal council and whoever received the vote, assuming they didnt have immunity, would have an extra vote against them.|$|R
5|$|In November 2007, the Pui Tak Center won a $100,000 {{grant from}} the Partners in Preservation, a program {{sponsored}} by American Express and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Spreading the word via e-mail, Facebook, and church sermons, the building led the five-week-long online contest from the start and ultimately received 14% of the vote. It received <b>more</b> <b>votes</b> {{than any of the}} other 24 historic Chicago sites participating in the contest, including the Robie House, the Chicago Cultural Center, and Unity Temple.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Taylor secured just 2,383 <b>more</b> <b>votes</b> than Goebel. The Democrat-controlled General Assembly {{challenged}} the election results. Under the Goebel Election Law, a three-man Board of Elections (dominated by Democrats) were {{to review the}} results and certify the winner in the contest. Two {{of the members of}} the board had openly campaigned for Goebel, and all three owed their appointments to him, but in a surprising decision, the board voted 2—1 to certify Taylor as the winner.|$|E
5|$|Keeping {{his promise}} to Milk, newly elected Mayor George Moscone {{appointed}} him to the Board of Permit Appeals in 1976, making him the first openly gay city commissioner in the United States. Milk, however, considered seeking {{a position in the}} California State Assembly. The district was weighted heavily in his favor, as much of it was based in neighborhoods surrounding Castro Street, where Milk's sympathizers voted. In the previous race for supervisor, Milk received <b>more</b> <b>votes</b> than the currently seated assemblyman. However, Moscone had made a deal with the assembly speaker that another candidate should run—Art Agnos. Furthermore, by order of the mayor, neither appointed nor elected officials were allowed to run a campaign while performing their duties.|$|E
50|$|Rhiannon contested the New South Wales Legislative Council at the 1999 state {{election}} for the Australian Greens. She was elected with {{three percent of}} the statewide <b>vote</b> (<b>more</b> than 100,000 <b>votes),</b> joining fellow Green Ian Cohen in the state's upper house. She was re-elected with over nine percent of the <b>vote</b> (<b>more</b> than 300,000 <b>votes)</b> at the 2007 state election, taking her seat with three other Greens MLCs.|$|R
5|$|C: Fredric March {{received}} one <b>more</b> <b>vote</b> than Wallace Beery. Academy rules {{at that time}} considered such a close margin to be a tie, so both March and Beery received the award. Under current Academy rules, however, dual awards are given only for exact ties.|$|R
5000|$|One [...] "controlling individual" [...] having 50% or <b>more</b> <b>voting</b> plus 50% or more {{economic}} interest. Or two such individuals if they own half each.

5|$|Kurt and {{his father}} Burt are called in to see Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), where it is {{revealed}} that although Kurt apparently won his election by 190 votes, <b>more</b> <b>votes</b> have been cast than there are students. Kurt admits that he contemplated cheating, but decided against doing so. Nevertheless, Kurt is disqualified and Brittany wins the election. Kurt tells Finn and Rachel that he is still under suspicion, and after he leaves, Rachel admits to Finn {{that she was the}} one who stuffed the ballot box because she wanted to help Kurt.|$|E
5|$|Landlords {{generally}} divided their estates {{into smaller}} farms that they rented to tenant farmers. Tenant farmers were generally on one-year leases, {{and could be}} evicted even if they paid their rents. Some of the tenants were large farmers who farmed over , but the majority were much smaller—on average between 15 and 50 acres (0.06–0.20km2). Many small farmers worked as labourers on the larger farms. The poorest agricultural workers were the landless labourers, {{who worked on the}} land of other farmers. Farmers were an important group politically, having <b>more</b> <b>votes</b> than any other sector of society.|$|E
5|$|McGovern–Hatfield {{was put up}} for a vote {{again in}} 1971, with {{somewhat}} weaker provisions designed to gain more support. In polls, a large majority of the public now favored its intent, and McGovern took his name off a final form of it, as some senators were just objecting to him. Nevertheless, in June 1971, it failed to pass again, gaining only a few <b>more</b> <b>votes</b> than the year before. McGovern was now certain that the only way the war would come to a quick end was if there was a new president.|$|E

He was also voted second-team All-Pro, barely missing the first team as Jon Beason of Carolina Panthers collected one <b>more</b> <b>vote</b> than Willis.|$|R
50|$|A modern-style {{bicameral}} constitutionally-based legislature of the Kingdom of Saxony {{was introduced}} in 1831. In {{the wake of the}} tumultuous 1848 revolutions, Saxony's Landtag extended voting rights (though still maintaining property requirements) and abolished voting-taxes. In 1871, Saxony was incorporated into the German Empire and <b>more</b> <b>voting</b> rights were gradually extended.|$|R
5|$|On December 19, 1904, Barkley {{declared}} his candidacy for county attorney of McCracken County {{well before the}} March 1905 Democratic primary. The Republicans did not nominate a candidate, so the Democratic primary was the de facto general election. Barkley faced two opponents in the primary – two-term incumbent Eugene A. Graves and Paducah Police Court Judge David Cross. He organized his own campaign and made speeches across the county, showcasing his eloquence and likeability. Graves received <b>more</b> <b>votes</b> than Barkley in Paducah, but McCracken County's rural farmers gave Barkley the victory, 1,525 votes to 1,096; Cross came in third with 602 votes. This {{was the only time}} Barkley ever challenged an incumbent Democrat.|$|E
5|$|Results {{showed that}} Golkar, the former ruling {{party of the}} New Order era led by People's Representative Council Speaker Akbar Tanjung, had won {{the largest number of}} seats, {{defeating}} President Megawati Sukarnoputri's Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle (PDI–P). Golkar received <b>more</b> <b>votes</b> than other parties in twenty-six out of thirty-two provinces. However, these results occurred because of declining PDI–P popularity rather than an increase in Golkar's popularity. Golkar's support in its traditional stronghold of Sulawesi declined due to the performance of medium and small parties in the region. Despite winning the largest share of vote once again in Bali, PDI–P performance there suffered the greatest after the 2002 bombings by terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah devastated the island province's economy.|$|E
5|$|The local {{elections}} of 2003 were a {{success for the}} party. In 36 municipalities, the party gained <b>more</b> <b>votes</b> than any other; it succeeded in electing the mayor in only 13 of these, but also secured 40 deputy mayor positions. The Progress Party had participated in {{local elections}} since 1975, but until 2003 had only secured a mayoral position four times, all on separate occasions. The Progress Party vote in Os—the only municipality that elected a Progress Party mayor in 1999—increased from 36.6% in 1999 to 45.7% in 2003. The party also became the single largest in the counties of Vestfold and Rogaland.|$|E
50|$|Liberty Media {{subsequently}} spent $5 {{billion on}} nine German regional cable networks. Apart from television distribution it holds major interests in other groups. For example, {{it was the}} largest shareholder in News Corporation (though the founding Murdoch family owns <b>more</b> <b>voting</b> shares), and had a 4% stake in Time Warner.|$|R
50|$|Whilst some {{parties have}} {{nominated}} over 400 candidates, {{it was always}} unlikely that any single Party would elect over 200 members. In order to form a Government, under Ukraine's constitution, parties will need to form a coalition with two or <b>more</b> <b>voting</b> blocks within the first month following the declaration of the polls.|$|R
