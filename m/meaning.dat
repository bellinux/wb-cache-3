5|$|Languages express <b>meaning</b> by {{relating}} a sign form to a <b>meaning,</b> or its content. Sign forms must {{be something}} that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific <b>meaning</b> by social convention. Because the basic relation of <b>meaning</b> for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, {{in the sense that the}} convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its <b>meaning.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} has shown that <b>meanings</b> of smoking are highly predictive of smoking in middle school children. Three factors of <b>meanings</b> of smoking have been suggested in the literature: personal <b>meanings,</b> functional <b>meanings,</b> and social <b>meanings.</b> These conceptually derived factors of <b>meanings</b> of smoking have not previously been empirically studied. Purpose: This study examined the factor structure of the <b>Meanings</b> of Smoking Index (MSI) to determine the unique contribution of <b>meanings</b> of smoking and positive outcome expectancies to smoking behavior in middle school children. Methods: A multiethnic sample of 2, 247 eighth-grade students enrolled in 24 middle schools in greater Los Angeles completed a paper-and-pencil survey in class. Results: Four factors of the MSI emerged (functional, personal, social image, and weight concern). Positive outcome expectancies and each of the four factors of the MSI predicted lifetime smoking in a multivariate model. Conclusions: <b>Meanings</b> of smoking were empirically distinct from positive outcome expectancies. Adolescents who endorsed personal and functional <b>meanings</b> were more likely to smoke. Social image and weight concern <b>meanings</b> were negatively related to smoking after controlling for all other <b>meanings.</b> <b>Meanings</b> of smoking may prove to be important and modifiable mediators of smoking and therefore useful in future prevention studies...|$|R
5|$|Depending on modality, {{language}} structure can {{be based}} on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct <b>meaning</b> are studied in phonology. The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics. In spoken language, <b>meaning</b> is produced when sounds {{become part of a}} system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing <b>meaning</b> and others do not. In any given language, {{only a limited number of}} the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing <b>meaning.</b>|$|E

Throughout Ottoman history, Turkish and Kurdish tribesmen have settled into Armenian villages and changed the native Armenian names (i.e. the Armenian Norashen was changed to Norşin). This was especially true after the Armenian genocide, when much of eastern Turkey was depopulated of its Armenian population.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{properties}} that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, <b>meaning</b> {{that there is no}} predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, <b>meaning</b> that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, <b>meaning</b> that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, <b>meaning</b> that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.|$|E

Cne hundred fourth graders ranked the familiarity cf multiple definitions of 60 words given in a semantic survey.

A second version of the test was developed using a low-association value trigram instead of the target real word. The two versions were administered to 64 subjects. from three fourth-grade classes randomly assigned to experimental groups. There were consistently more errors cn obscure <b>meanings</b> than on common <b>meanings.</b> The mean difference was greater with real words (- 4. 81) than with trigrams (-. 75).
