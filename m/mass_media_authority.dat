40|$|This article {{argues that}} the decisive part of the {{interaction}} between social movements and political authorities is no longer the direct, physical confrontation between them in concrete locations, but the indirect, mediated encounters among contenders in the arena of the <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> public sphere. <b>Authorities</b> react to social movement activities if and as they are depicted in the <b>mass</b> <b>media,</b> and conversely movement activists become aware of political opportunities and constraints through the reactions (or non-reactions) that their actions provoke in the public sphere. The dynamics of this mediated interaction among political contenders can be analyzed as an evolutionary process. Of the great variety of attempts to mobilize public attention, only a few can be accommodated in the bounded media space. Three selection mechanisms-labelled here as "discursive opportunities" - can be identified that affect the diffusion chances of contentious messages: visibility (the extent to which a message is covered by the <b>mass</b> <b>media),</b> resonance (the extent to which others - allies, opponents, authorities, etc. -react to a message), and legitimacy (the degree to which such reactions are supportive).

5000|$|The term <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> {{refers to}} any means or {{technology}} used to communicate {{a message to}} large groups of people. Popular forms of <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> include television, the Internet, and newspapers. <b>Mass</b> <b>media</b> are specifically intended to reach larger audiences. The term is often divided into two broad categories: that of electronic <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> and that of print <b>mass</b> <b>media.</b> Electronic <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> require their audiences to interact with electronics {{in order to receive}} the message. They attempt to recreate or represent a message through moving pictures and/or sound. Four common examples of electronic media used in Canadian society are television, radio, films, and the Internet. Print <b>mass</b> <b>media,</b> on the other hand, refers to any media that is distributed to audiences in a printed form, on paper. Examples of this include newspapers, printed books, and magazines. The <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> model in Canada is different from the <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> model of the United States as well {{as the rest of the}} world. According to John A. Irving, <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> functions differently in Canadian society because of a lack of collective identity; this is in reference to Canada's languages (and related cultures) as well as its proximity to the United States. Irving states that such cultural dualism means that only some of the population responds to the <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> in English, while the other portion remain uninfluenced by English-based media. In terms of the proximity to the United States, he explains that [...] "most of the difficulties that threaten the <b>mass</b> <b>media</b> in Canada are the direct outcome of American economic and cultural imperialism." [...] Because of the United States' overwhelming influence on Canadian <b>mass</b> <b>media,</b> Canada has not been able to form its own identity in the media. These two factors have slowed down the process of the creation of a Canadian community. <b>Mass</b> <b>media</b> help in forming a community through communication. When a large group of people is in communication with one another through media, an identifiable culture is formed. Individuals in dialectic experience a sense of membership and collective identity.|$|R
