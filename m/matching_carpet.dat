50|$|Following {{interior}} re-decoration in 2006, {{including the}} removal of the old pews and pulpit, a service of re-dedication was held on 4 February 2007 with the Bishop of Monmouth. The interior is now decorated with individually dedicated chairs and <b>matching</b> <b>carpet.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1993 Peugeot {{introduced}} the 205 and 405 STDT, a higher performance diesel model to sit between the standard diesel range {{and the higher}} end GTI cars. The 205 STDT (special trim diesel turbo) was available only in the 3-door bodyshell with a 1,769 cc turbo diesel engine (XUD7 T/K) with the trim and luxuries of the 205 GTI. The car was initially marketed towards executives, with soft cloth bucket seats in Beige with <b>matching</b> <b>carpet</b> and dashboard, as {{also found in the}} Gentry models. The car featured PAS, central locking, electric windows and also electrically heated mirrors. Many were fitted with a large, vacuum-seal slide sunroof.|$|E
5000|$|The Dolomite changed {{very little}} (in all its variants) from the {{beginning}} to the very end, only minor trim differences and additional standard equipment being the main changes. 1979 saw the introduction of the Dolomite SE, of which 2163 were built. The bodyshell was of the basic 1500 (single headlamps) but the interior was fitted with luxury trim including burr walnut dashboard and door cappings (the dashboard was the same style as fitted to that of the Dolomite 1300), grey velour seats and <b>matching</b> <b>carpet.</b> All the cars were painted black with wide silver stripes running full length, with the letters [...] "SE" [...] {{at the end of the}} rear wing. The SE also sported a front spoiler and Spitfire style road wheels. By the late 1970s the Dolomite was looking increasingly old fashioned against newer competition, though still popular. Designer Giovanni Michelotti delivered a promising new design (Sprint based) and resembling a Fiat 132 [...] with a squared front and BMW style 'kink'. At least one full-size example was built. With severe problems at BLMC, management refused, there was simply not enough money. Production continued until August 1980 when BL closed the Canley Factory as part of a restructuring process which also resulted in the closure of the MG factory at Abingdon two months later.|$|E
50|$|On the interior, pleated {{leather seats}} from MOMO were offered in White, Red, Black and Tan. These seats came with {{respective}} <b>matching</b> colored <b>carpet,</b> pleated leather door card inserts {{as well as}} color coded stitching around, hand brake, gear lever and the stitching of an all new three-spoke steering wheel.|$|R
25|$|The {{first-class}} carriages were {{fitted with}} blue-wool seating and blue/grey carpets. The second-class carriages were furnished with orange seats and a russet (tan/brown) carpet. All materials were fire-retardant, and non-skid Pirelli flooring was fitted at the entrances and service areas; in blue to <b>match</b> the <b>carpets</b> {{in the first}} class areas, and in maroon for the second class areas. Following customer feedback, the seating arrangements in the economy cars were reorganised to place the centres of back-to-back seats in line with pillars between windows.|$|R
50|$|Under the {{direction}} of Zena Krakowsky, a long-time Truckee resident and progressive businessperson, the mansion underwent an extensive and painstakingly precise seven-year rehabilitation, with attention being paid to every detail, including closely <b>matching</b> the Axminster <b>carpet,</b> wallpaper to reflect the originals, and custom-mixed paints to tie the interior architecture together. All parts were refurbished, including molding, fretwork and stained-glass windows.|$|R
6000|$|... "But..." [...] A look of hopeless misery {{came into}} Ginger's {{pleasant}} face. He hesitated. Then, {{with the air}} of a man bracing himself to a dreadful, but unavoidable, ordeal, he went on. He spoke gruffly, and his eyes, which had been fixed on Sally's, wandered down to the <b>match</b> on the <b>carpet.</b> It was still glowing, and mechanically he put a foot on it.|$|R
60|$|His was a {{sensitive}} soul, eye and ear were both acute. He perceived, without accounting for it, that {{the walls and}} hangings were complementary in color, that the furniture <b>matched</b> the <b>carpet,</b> and that {{the pictures on the}} wall were unusually good. They were not all highly-colored, naked subjects, as he had been led to expect. His respect for Mrs. Raimon rose, for he remembered that Mary's home, while just as different from this as Mary was different from Mrs. Raimon, had, after all, something in common--both were beautiful to him, though Mary's home was sweeter, daintier, and homelier. He {{was in the midst of}} an analysis of these subtleties when Mrs. Raimon (as he now determined to call her) returned from changing her dress.|$|R
2500|$|The Edition {{models are}} more track {{oriented}} {{compared to the}} standard models, being equipped with stiffer springs and anti-roll bars, reset dampers and a lowered chassis, a fully visible carbon body, unique 11 spoke wheels and a large adjustable rear wing, and a larger front splitter and side strakes capable of producing [...] of downforce at [...] The interior is also reworked and features; color <b>matched</b> leather <b>carpets,</b> Koenigsegg Edition side step plates, Edition chronograph instrument cluster, a new Edition only layout for the center console control panels, and features a special version of the Koenigsegg Chronocluster including a redesigned center console. All other extra equipment for the Koenigsegg Edition CCXR and CCX comes as standard: carbon wheels, special interior trim and color, rearview camera, Satnav or Bluetooth, amplifiers, and a complete Inconell exhaust system.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said; [...] "see these chairs, garnet-colored satin, with {{a pattern}} on each; well, the sofa's just like them, and the {{curtains}} to <b>match,</b> and the <b>carpets</b> {{made for the}} floor with centrepieces and borders. I never saw anything more magnificent in my life. Sophie's governor furnishes the house, and everything is to be A No. 1, and all that, you see. Messrs. Curtain & Collamore are coming to make the rooms up, and her mother is busy as a bee getting us in order." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Detour {{described}} where {{teams had}} to choice between Shine or Design. In Shine, teams had {{to locate a}} marked shoe shine stall at Yeni Camii and convince 10 locals to have their shoes shined for no less than 4 [...] each until receiving their next clue. In Design, teams must find a marked carpet stall in the Spice Bazaar (known as [...] "Egyptian Bazaar") and choose a piece of fabric from an exotic Turkish pattern, then find a perfect <b>match</b> among the <b>carpets</b> to get their next clue.|$|R
50|$|Changes to Continental Flying Spur include: DVD-based {{satellite}} navigation system with post code-entry programming (replacing CD-based navigation system), wireless telecommunications with an integrated Bluetooth remote SIM access profile (rSAP) telephone system (optional rear-seat telephone), a new 19-inch 5-spoke alloy wheel design becomes standard (optional chromed or bright-machined finish), extra body colour options from Bentley Arnage, new optional veneered picnic tables {{to the rear}} of both front seats include full range of veneers (including Chestnut), increased veneer option from 4 to 7, optional contrast stitching to the leather hides and choose to <b>match</b> the boot <b>carpet</b> to the cabin interior carpets.|$|R
50|$|The theater's {{auditorium}} {{can accommodate}} 2,054 people. The seating is stadium-style {{for the best}} view. The seats and <b>carpets</b> <b>match</b> Williams' Navajo rug collection and are forest green, magenta, gold and blue. On display inside the auditorium are nineteen Japanese Kimonos. The stage has accommodated numerous shows and guest celebrities. On stage, Williams was joined by Glen Campbell, Ann-Margret, Petula Clark and Charo. The theater has also played host to Phyllis Diller, Pat Boone, The Osmond Family, Robert Goulet, Rich Little, Shari Lewis & Lamb Chop, David Copperfield, Pat Benatar and Broadway on Ice starring Nancy Kerrigan, Tara Lipinski and Rudy Galindo.|$|R
2500|$|Bonin was {{physically}} linked {{to many of}} the murders by blood and semen stains, and numerous, distinctive green triskelion-shaped carpet fibers found upon seven of the victims' bodies which were forensically proven to be a precise <b>match</b> with the <b>carpeting</b> in the rear of Bonin's van. Furthermore, upon three victims' bodies, investigators had discovered hair samples which had proven to be a precise match with Bonin. Medical evidence also revealed that six of the murders for which Bonin was charged were committed by a unique windlass strangulation method, which was referred to by the prosecutor at Bonin's Los Angeles County trial as [...] "a signature, a trademark." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{passenger}} compartment was normally luxurious, clad {{in the best}} materials, with seating for between two and most often up to six or occasionally eight persons, made of the finest cotton or silk adorned with brocade. The same material was also most often used to provide complete curtain coverage for the compartment, and was <b>matched</b> by substantial <b>carpet</b> and fine inlaid woodwork. The drivers compartment had leather seats to be durable enough to endure the weather. The division between the two compartments often held jump seats for lighter passengers such as children, and it would often accommodate various compartments for drinks, cigars, make-up, or books.|$|R

50|$|The main salon {{was entered}} through sliding {{doors on the}} main deck with stairs leading to a social hall on the {{hurricane}} deck with a large oil painting of President Monroe above the builder's plate located on the landing all topped by a well with a skylight patterned with green wreaths and mauve ribbons on an opalescent background. A special stateroom, with a full sized brass bed and private bath with a white porcelain tub was off {{the base of the}} stairway opposite the purser's office. These areas, as were the staterooms, were carpeted with Royal Wilton <b>carpets</b> <b>matching</b> the green general decor of furnishings.|$|R
5000|$|Packer {{is first}} {{introduced}} in the pilot episode of the series, although he is only heard over the phone and is not voiced by Koechner. When Michael is talking with Jan Levinson-Gould, Vice President of Sales, Packer calls the office. After Michael refers to Packer as a [...] "terrific rep", when he answers the phone, which is on speaker, Packer calls Michael a [...] "big queen" [...] and asks him whether Jan, whom {{he refers to as}} [...] "Godzillary", has arrived at the office yet before expressing a wish to ask her if [...] "the <b>carpet</b> <b>matches</b> the drapes". Michael then hangs up on him and awkwardly tells Jan that Packer is a [...] "horrible person".|$|R
2500|$|During the Clinton administration, the faux {{white marble}} finish {{painted on the}} mantels and baseboards in the 1960s was removed to reveal the {{original}} [...] "rouge antique" [...] (reddish) marble from Vermont installed during the White House's renovation in 1951. Although the East Room's oak floors had been bare since 1903, three <b>matching</b> $259,330 wool <b>carpets</b> were installed in February 1995. These carpets, ordered in 1990, were designed to reflect the plaster ceiling moldings created during the John Quincy Adams administration in the late 1820s. Woven by Edward Fields Inc. of New York and paid for with private donations raised by the White House Endowment Fund, the carpets were designed to cover most of the floor {{to protect it from}} dirt and the occasional pebble stuck in the tread of a shoe.|$|R
5000|$|By 1973, Tetro was {{learning}} about art by reading books and visiting museums. He never had formal art training or {{a desire to}} develop his own style, but he liked to paint and he liked copying from the masters. He found the exercise taught him more about the art, enabled him to understand why an artist had done a particular thing, which merely looking at a painting did not reveal. He learned about paper and canvas and experimented {{to find ways of}} producing craquelure, a characteristic of old paintings. Still a hobby, he began selling his copies at art fairs. He then began copying photographs and painting portraits. His hobby became a business and he became known within wealthy circles. The art market expanded in the 1980s and according to one Los Angeles art dealer, some people were more concerned about <b>matching</b> their <b>carpet</b> than they were about the authenticity of a painting. Reproductions were in demand and Tetro had a reputation for making flawless copies, even {{going so far as to}} travel to Europe to buy wooden stretchers and canvas particular to where a certain artist had worked. He says he never marketed his paintings and lithographs as originals and his business card read, [...] "Tony Tetro. Art reproductions." [...] He says dealers told him his work would be sold to people who couldn't afford originals.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1960s the cinema {{was already in}} decline. On weekdays it was used for playing bingo and in 1966 it became a {{full-time}} bingo hall. The bingo hall was first operated by Granada and from 1991 until 2011 by Gala. The large Wurlitzer theatre organ, which had been played by Reginald Dixon, was removed in 1996 and sold to the village hall in Tywyn, Wales. In 2011 the building was bought by Christ Faith Tabernacle Churches, a Pentecostal church founded in 1989 by the Nigerian preacher Alfred Williams. Where possible, the interior has been restored meticulously, new doors {{were made by the}} same company that made them in 1937, light fittings were commissioned to match the original lights, and new <b>carpets</b> <b>match</b> the 1930s design. The building, now known as the [...] "Ebenezer Building" [...] or [...] "Cathedral" [...] of Christ Faith Tabernacle, has been a Grade II listed building since 1973. Since 2000 its status was upgraded to Grade II*.|$|R
5000|$|The engine {{delivers}} [...] and 820 Nm of torque, {{supported by}} a suspension reinforced with special Koni shock-absorbers and stiffer anti-roll bars. The bodywork featured a blanked-out front grille and modified side vents - replicating the side vents of the Le Mans winning DBR-1 - {{as well as a}} bigger front spoiler and rear skirt. The interior was reworked with a gigantic rev-counter, a special Titanium finish on some parts, and features such as heated windshield, parking radars, traction control, heated electric seats, and full Connolly leather upholstery with <b>matching</b> Wilton wool <b>carpets.</b> Wheels were the same Dymag magnesium units as seen on most V600s. Performance included a claimed top speed of 200 mph (or 320 km/h) and zero to 100 km/h in 3.9 seconds. The keyholder was in sterling silver and a map from Newport-Pagnell to the legendary Le Mans track was provided in the delivery documents. Each car was made upon special commission and fitted with a number plate indicating also the name of the first owner.|$|R
2500|$|The {{prosecutor}} at Bonin's Orange County trial, Bryan Brown, {{contended that}} all four victims killed within this constituency had been abducted while hitchhiking, then ordered to strip before being bound about the wrists and ankles. Each {{of the four}} victims had then endured rape, beatings, torture, and finally ligature strangulation. In each instance, the ligature had left an impression measuring approximately one-half of an inch upon the victim's neck. Brown also hearkened toward the similarities {{in each of these}} murders and two of those for which Bonin had earlier been convicted in Los Angeles County: Charles Miranda and Steven Wells. Particular emphasis was placed upon the fiber evidence found upon each of the Orange County victims—in addition to three victims killed in Los Angeles County—being a precise match to the distinctive carpeting in the rear of Bonin's van. As such, Brown stated, the four Orange County victims had been killed by the same individual who had killed Miranda and Wells, and his accomplices in these two murders, Miiley and Munro, would testify as to their accompanying Bonin on each of these murders. To further support this contention, the prosecution also presented forensic experts who testified that the fibers discovered upon the bodies of all six victims in question were a precise <b>match</b> with the <b>carpeting</b> in Bonin's van. The interior of the van had also been extensively stained with human blood. In reference to the evidence found within the van itself, Brown stated to the jury: [...] "One can truly say from the evidence found within the van it is a virtual death wagon." ...|$|R
5000|$|In summer 2004 {{the capitol}} closed for an {{extensive}} renovation, which included restoration {{work and a}} seismic upgrade. The renovation was guided by three main goals, first strengthen the structure to withstand {{as much as a}} 7.3 magnitude earthquake, then restore the original architectural and artistic details of the building, all while retaining functionality after the renovation. On August 7, 2004, the day before the capitol closed, a [...] "Capitol Discovery Day" [...] was held, and the public was invited to visit the capitol and learn about the changes being made, and why the project was necessary. By August 8, the day the capitol closed, the renovation had already begun in certain locations around Capitol Hill. In 2002, following the 2002 Winter Olympics, some buildings added to the capitol campus, such as the circular cafeteria building, were demolished, and construction started on two new buildings. These two buildings, constructed north of the capitol, would serve as temporary offices during the structure's restoration. Much of the asbestos on the exterior of the building (used to waterproof the dome) had been removed that summer by inmates from the Utah State Prison, working in the Utah Correctional Industries program.Some of the major improvements made during the renovation included updating or replacing the heating, cooling, plumbing, and electrical systems. Many rooms in the structure were restored to their original size, having been divided into smaller rooms over time; while others, like the Senate Chamber, were enlarged. Rooms were repainted their original colors, and new <b>carpets,</b> <b>matching</b> the 1916 originals, were installed. The 550 original windows had been replaced with aluminum trimmed ones in the early 1960s, and during the restoration they were replaced with replicated mahogany-trimmed, energy efficient, and in some areas bulletproof, windows. Original furniture was restored, and new period furniture was purchased. The floor of the rotunda had originally included glass, which allowed light to pass from the skylights down to the first floor, and the glass was restored during the renovations.|$|R
