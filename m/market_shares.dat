5|$|An {{advantage}} held by Eurostar is {{the convenience}} {{and speed of}} the service: with shorter check-in times than at most airports and hence quicker boarding and less queueing and high punctuality, it takes less time to travel between central London and central Paris by high-speed rail than it does by air. Eurostar now has a dominant share of the combined rail–air market on its routes to Paris and Brussels. In 2004, it had a 66% share of the London–Paris market, and a 59% share of the London–Brussels market. In 2007, it achieved record <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> of 71% for London–Paris and 65% for London–Brussels routes.|$|E

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsBryan W. SchurleThe {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} simulation model to determine the probability of achieving a <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal. Two different simulation models were developed and compared allowing the author to select the best model. The first simulation model developed used the current <b>market</b> <b>share</b> as the mean and the standard deviation of historical <b>market</b> <b>share</b> as the standard deviation. So, a <b>market</b> <b>share</b> of 31. 00 % and a standard deviation of 3. 88 % were used in the simulation. When these values were simulated the results determined the probability of achieving the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal of 33 %. The simulation results indicated that only 12 out of 100 observations resulted in <b>market</b> <b>share</b> greater than the goal. Therefore, there is a 12 % probability of achieving or exceeding the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal based on the current <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and historical <b>market</b> <b>share</b> standard deviation. To predict future <b>market</b> <b>share,</b> a regression model was used to determine the impact of factors on <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> The regression model was used to forecast an estimate of <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> This forecasted share of 31. 13 % was used as the mean and 3. 45 %, the standard error of the model, was used to generate a second simulation model. The simulation results indicated that 26 of 100 observations resulted in <b>market</b> <b>share</b> greater than the goal of 33 %. This indicates that there is a 26 % probability of achieving or exceeding the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal based on results using regression to predict future <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and variability in <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> The second simulation model generated from the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> forecast and standard error from the regression model produced the better results. When using a regression model, it resulted in a higher estimate for meeting the goal. The addition of independent variables that impact share explained more of the variability around the projected mean than the historical model did...|$|R

Linx had offered tickets with a lower price than Scandinavian Airlines, who operated the airline service between Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Stockholm-Arlanda Airport. Ryanair also provided an airline service, but with fewer departures and with the same center-to-center transport time because it flew from the secondary Sandefjord Airport, Torp and Stockholm-Skavsta Airport. From 1 September 2003, Norwegian Air Shuttle started services from Gardermoen to Arlanda, and became a more direct competitor to Linx. From 27 October, Nordic Airlink (later FlyNordic) also started a flight between the same airports.
