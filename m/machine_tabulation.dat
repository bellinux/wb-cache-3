40|$|In a {{representative}} democracy {{the process of}} selecting those who represent the electorate is critical and ensuring “fair ” and valid elections has been of concern as long as elections have been held. In the United States, the voting process since early {{in the last century}} has generally moved to one of increasing inclusiveness and representation. A broadly recognized {{solution to the problem of}} mechanical failure in <b>machine</b> <b>tabulation,</b> electronic voting (e-voting) has been extensively debated in the literature, but mostly from a purely technological standpoint. While these machines have generally delivered on the promises of increased accuracy, more timely generation of results, and flexibility in terms of ability to address the needs of a wide range of capacities, they nevertheless operate within a complex environment moderated by social and behavioral variables. For voters with disabilities (VWD), 1 barriers to voting arise not only from physical factors such as inaccessible facilities, or limitations of voting technology per se, but from less recognized and more insidious cultural, social, or awareness related factors. This paper presents some of the preliminary findings of a pilot survey of voter satisfaction with the voting process...|$|E

5000|$|The {{election}} {{marked the}} first time that the province used electronic vote <b>tabulation</b> <b>machines</b> from Dominion Voting in Ontario in a provincial election. They had previously been used in New Brunswick municipal elections. On election night, the machines displayed vote totals which were verified by Elections New Brunswick officials and entered into a province-wide database for the media. By 11:45 PM, these unverified numbers were to have been replaced by totally machine-reported numbers from the tabulators themselves with no human interventions or errors possible to distort results. It was [...] "a program processing the initial results that had a glitch", not the tabulators themselves, according to officials.|$|R

[...] Venable reportedly had sought a recount because [...] "about seven-tenths of one percent" [...] of the primary votes determined the outcome of the election and because long lines at polling places in Sullivan County had reportedly discouraged voters. The Tennessee Republican Party Primary Board decided not to have a recount, giving the nomination to Davis.|$|R
2500|$|In the United States {{during the}} 1940s, {{for the first}} time a {{powerful}} interaction between segregation laws and race differences in terms of socioeconomic status enabled white families to abandon inner cities in favor of suburban living. The result was severe urban decay that, by the 1960s, resulted in crumbling [...] "ghettos". [...] Prior to national data available in the 1950 US census, a migration pattern of disproportionate numbers of whites moving from cities to suburban communities was easily dismissed as merely anecdotal. Because American urban populations were still substantially growing, a relative decrease in one racial or ethnic component eluded scientific proof to the satisfaction of policy makers. In essence, data on urban population change had not been separated into what are now familiarly identified its [...] "components." [...] The first data set potentially capable of proving [...] "white flight" [...] was the 1950 census. But original processing of this data, on older-style <b>tabulation</b> <b>machines</b> by the US Census Bureau, failed to attain any approved level of statistical proof. It was rigorous reprocessing of the same raw data on a UNIVAC I, led by Donald J. Bogue of the Scripps Foundation and Emerson Seim of the University of Chicago, that scientifically established the reality of white flight.|$|R
5000|$|Ohio State Senator Jeff Jacobson, Republican, asked Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, also a Republican, in July 2003 to disqualify Diebold's bid {{to supply}} voting {{machines}} for the state, after security problems {{were discovered in}} its software, but was refused. Blackwell had ordered Diebold touch screen voting machines, reversing an earlier decision {{by the state to}} purchase only optical scan voting machines which, unlike the touch screen devices, would leave a [...] "paper trail" [...] for recount purposes. Blackwell was found, in April 2006, to own 83 shares of Diebold stock, down from 178 shares purchased in January 2005, which he attributed to an unidentified financial manager at Credit Suisse First Boston who had violated his instructions to avoid potential conflict of interest, without his knowledge. When Cuyahoga county's primary was held on May 2, 2006, officials ordered the hand-counting of more than 18,000 paper ballots after Diebold's new optical scan <b>machines</b> produced inconsistent <b>tabulations,</b> leaving several local races in limbo for days and eventually resulting in a reversal of the outcome of one race for state representative.

This study investigated the effect of light levels on client self-disclosure. The sample consisted of 30 women clients ranging in age from 18 - 29 who were students enrolled at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, IL. These clients were self-referred or recruited from courses in the field of human services, and received counseling at the Counseling Laboratory located in Graham Hall. Counselors who participated in the study were part of a master's level practicum class. Counseling sessions were conducted in low or high light levels. The effect of light levels was examined by the number of client "I" statements, number of words spoken by the client, and number of client affective words. A semantic differential that measured client attitude of the counseling session was completed by clients {{at the end of the}} second counseling session. To obtain the necessary client self-disclosure, a 10 -minute segment of the second counseling session was audio taped. The 10 -minute segment corresponded to the 20 - 30 minute segment of an hour-long session. The audio tape was then transcribed by the experimenter using a transcription <b>machine</b> and computer. <b>Tabulation</b> of the client self-disclosure measures was accomplished using the "search to count words" function that was part of the 1986 computer software program IBM Writing Assistant Version 2. 0. Client self-disclosure data was analyzed using Analysis of Co-Variance, while semantic differential data was analyzed using t-tests. Results indicated that light levels had no effect on number of client "I" statements, number of client words, and number of client affective words. Client attitude of the counseling setting was also not influenced by light levels based on semantic differential results...|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} is {{the third}} annual report of fish kills caused by pollution occurring in the United States. The reporting of pollution-caused fish kills was begun by the Public Health Service in the Spring of 1960 {{in an effort to}} secure additional information on the effects of pollution in the Nation 2 ̆ 7 s waters, to elicit the cooperation and assistance of conservation groups in the States to help determine causes of fish kills and assist in their abatement, and to place responsibility for fish kills where it belonged. The Surgeon General asked all State conservation and fish and game agencies to assist him by reporting instances of fish kills attributable to pollutants entering the streams or lakes of the Nation. A self-addressed postcard reporting form was devised in cooperation with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the various independent conservation organizations. The form, shown in this publication as figure 1, was furnished to the State agencies to be completed as occasions arose and mailed to the Public Health Service. Summary totals and statistical evaluations and conclusions are based upon the information contained in these reporting forms. The fish kill activity has just completed its third year of operation. As it matures and as the reporting authorities in the States become accustomed to furnishing more complete information about each kill, the resulting publications will undoubtedly become more meaningful, and serve as a more useful tool in helping to identify and abate pollution. In 1962, a semi-annual report was published listing reported fish kills for the period January-June, 1962. This present report includes all fish kills in 1962 which were reported by the various State agencies. Even though the resulting totals of fish killed are large, they probably represent only a fraction of fish actually killed throughout the United States by man-made pollution. In an effort to make the reporting of these fish kills more accurate and hence the published summaries more useful and effective, it was found desirable to revise portions of the postcard reporting form. Beginning in January 1963, the revised form was put into use throughout the States and future summaries will indicate more accurately the source of pollution believed to have killed the fish. Most pollution-caused fish kills are attributable to operational activities. The revised reporting form on which next year 2 ̆ 7 s publication will be based indicates four principal operations causing the majority of fish kills: agricultural, industrial, municipal, and transportation operations, with appropriate subheadings. When classified in this manner, the responsibility for causing fish kills can be more accurately defined. As the reporting forms are received from the States, copies are furnished to the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Reports were excluded from the listing if it was apparent that the kill was not related to pollution. Lack of sufficient dissolved oxygen in the water from natural biological activity will kill fish, but is not necessarily related to man-made pollution. Some reports indicated kills had occurred too far in the past to determine the cause or extent. Other reports stated that pollution occurred but no fish were killed, and some referred to shellfish which died of causes not related to pollution. Of the total reports received, however, only a small number are excluded from the summary. Acceptable reports are coded for <b>machine</b> punch card <b>tabulation</b> so that various statistical tables can be obtained. The punch card method permits the insertion of late reports in the sequence in which they occurred...|$|R
