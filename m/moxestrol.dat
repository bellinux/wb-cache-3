25|$|Ethinylestradiol (EE) is a {{more potent}} {{synthetic}} analogue of estradiol that is used widely in hormonal contraceptives. Mestranol, <b>moxestrol,</b> and quinestrol are derivatives of EE used clinically. A related drug is methylestradiol, which is also used clinically. Conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs), such as Premarin, a commonly prescribed estrogenic drug produced from the urine of pregnant mares, include the natural steroidal estrogens equilin and equilenin, as well as, especially, estrone sulfate (which itself is inactive and becomes active upon conversion into estrone). A related and very similar product to CEEs is esterified estrogens (EEs).|$|E
50|$|<b>Moxestrol</b> (INN) (brand name Surestryl), {{also known}} as 11β-methoxy-17α-ethynyl-1,3,5(10)-estratriene-3,17β-diol or as 11β-methoxy-17α-ethynylestradiol, is a synthetic, steroidal {{estrogen}} that is or was used in Europe {{for the treatment of}} menopausal symptoms. It is the 11β-methoxy derivative of ethinylestradiol, {{and is one of the}} most potent estrogens known, being some 10-100 times more potent than estradiol and about 5-fold more potent than ethinylestradiol. The very high potency of <b>moxestrol</b> has been attributed to its high affinity for the estrogen receptor (ER), its negligible plasma binding to sex hormone binding globulin and low binding to serum albumin, and its lower relative rate of metabolization. In contrast to estradiol, which has roughly the same affinity for both ERs (Ki = 0.12 nM and 0.15 nM, respectively), <b>moxestrol</b> possesses several-fold selectivity for ERα (Ki = 0.50 nM) over ERβ (Ki = 2.6 nM).|$|E
50|$|Synthetic {{derivatives}} of estradiol used as estrogens include ethinylestradiol, ethinylestradiol sulfonate, mestranol, methylestradiol, <b>moxestrol,</b> and quinestrol, all {{of which}} are 17α-substituted estradiol derivatives. Synthetic derivatives of estradiol used in scientific research include 8β-VE2 and 16α-LE2.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{derivatives}} of EE exist. These include mestranol (EE 3-methyl ether), quinestrol (EE 3-cyclopentyl ether), ethinylestradiol sulfonate (EE 3-isopropylsulfonate), and <b>moxestrol</b> (11β-methoxy-EE). The former three are prodrugs of EE, {{while the latter}} is not.|$|E

40|$|Estrogen is an {{important}} steroid hormone that mediates most of its effects on regulation of gene expression by binding to intracellular receptors. The consensus estrogen response element (ERE) is a 13 bp palindromic inverted repeat with a three nucleotide spacer. However, several reports suggest that many estrogen target genes are regulated by diverse elements, such as imperfect EREs and ERE half sites (ERE 1 / 2), which are either the proximal or the distal half of the palindrome. To gain more insight into ERE half site-mediated gene regulation, we used a region from the estrogen-regulated chicken riboflavin carrier protein (RCP) gene promoter that contains ERE half sites. Using <b>moxestrol,</b> an analogue of estrogen and transient transfection of deletion and mutation containing RCP promoter/reporter constructs in chicken hepatoma (LMH 2 A) cells, we identified an estrogen response unit (ERU) composed of two consensus ERE 1 / 2 sites and one non-consensus ERE 1 / 2 site. Mutation {{of any of these}} sites within this ERU abolishes <b>moxestrol</b> response. Further, the ERU is able to confer <b>moxestrol</b> responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. Interestingly, RCP promoter is regulated by <b>moxestrol</b> in estrogen responsive human MCF- 7 cells, but not in other cell lines such as NIH 3 T 3 and HepG 2 despite estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-�) co transfection. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with promoter regions encompassing the half sites and nuclear extracts from LMH 2 A cells show the presence of a moxestrol-induced complex that is abolished by a polyclonal anti-ER� antibody. Surprisingly, estrogen receptor cannot bind to these promoter elements in isolation. Thus, {{there appears to be a}} definite requirement for some other factor(s) in addition to estrogen receptor, for the generation of a suitable response of this promoter to estrogen. Our studies therefore suggest a novel mechanism of gene regulation by estrogen, involving ERE half sites without direct binding of ER to the cognate elements...|$|E
40|$|The binding of {{estrogen}} to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the plasma cannot {{account for the}} impaired estrogen response seen in immature rodents because estradiol (E 2) doses that far exceed the total body burden of AFP will stimulate only modest uterine growth. We investigated this phenomenon in immature female mice by determining their uterine weights 23 hr after intraperitoneal injection {{of estrogen}}s or AFP or both. Administration of either 0. 5 micrograms of E 2 or 10 ng of <b>moxestrol</b> (MOX) approximately doubled the uterine weight. Giving 1 microgram of AFP 1 hr before injection of either estrogen did not alter that response. Combining the E 2 and AFP just prior to injection resulted in decreased uterine growth (34 % inhibition). Preincubating the estrogens with purified AFP (0. 1 - 50 micrograms) {{did not affect the}} growth response to <b>moxestrol</b> but markedly decreased the response to E 2. This was not due to sequestering of hormone because maximal reduction of the E 2 response (ca. 65 % inhibition) required only 1. 0 microgram of AFP (AFP/E 2 molar ratio, 1 : 130), and higher AFP doses inhibited less. About 40 % of the growth elicited by injection of either 0. 5 micrograms of E 2 or 10 ng of MOX was inhibited when these doses were preceded by injection of the preincubated AFP/E 2 mixture but not when preceded by either of the components. In each experiment, the mitotic index of luminal epithelium was affected to the same degree as uterine weight. AFP and E 2 incubated for 1 hr thus produce a potent inhibitor of estrogen-stimulated mitotic activity and growth. This inhibitor might act upon estrogen-responsive cells at specific sites at which competition by an inactive component of AFP can block the process...|$|E
40|$|Ethinylestradiol (EE) has evident {{paradoxical}} {{effects on}} cancer risk for human breast and hepatic cancer which parallel {{in some respects}} its effects on estrogen-induced neoplasms in the hamster kidney and liver. EE {{has been shown to}} be only weakly carcinogenic in the hamster kidney, but the most potent carcinogenic estrogen in the hamster liver following prolonged treatment. Unexpectedly, when EE and potent carcinogenic estrogens, such as diethylstilbestrol (DES), 17 β-estradiol (E 2) and <b>Moxestrol</b> (MOX), are administered concomitantly, estrogen-induced carcinogenesis in the kidney is completely prevented. In studying this novel finding, we found that, compared with E 2 exposure alone, EE at 0. 05 and 1. 0 nM significantly (P < 0. 001) inhibited the rise in proliferation of cultured primary hamster proximal renal tubular (PRT) cells in th...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{non-polar}} environmental contaminants on {{components of the}} hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovary (HPO) axis were examined in herring gull (Larus argentatus) embryos and cultured avian hepatocytes. In the HPA axis studies, regression analysis of herring gull embryo yolk sac organochlorine residues against basal plasma corticosterone concentrations indicated statistically significant inverse relationships for polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDDs/PCDFs), total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), non-ortho PCBs, and 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) equivalents (TEQs). The activities of two intermediary metabolic enzymes were inversely correlated with PCDDs/PCDFs. In a second study, high incidences of early onset of hatching were observed for herring gull eggs collected from some Great Lakes sites. Embryos from Scotch Bonnet Island were observed to have higher than average renal PEPCK activities and lower than average corticosterone stress responses. Regression analysis of embryo yolk sac organochlorine residues from three Great Lakes sites indicated a statistically significant positive relationship for basal plasma corticosterone concentrations and chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs), including organochlorine pesticides. HPO axis studies involved development of a reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) bioassay to semi-quantitatively measure mRNA for the estrogen-inducible egg yolk precursor protein, vitellogenin (VTG), in avian embryo hepatocyte cultures. Short regions of VTG, beta-actin and albumin cDNAs were cloned and sequenced for several species of birds. Hepatocyte cultures were prepared from both chicken and herring gull embryos and treated with the estradiol analogue, <b>moxestrol,</b> or the organochlorine insecticide, o,p'-DDT. Herring gull embryo hepatocyte cultures responded with VTG mRNA induction at 1 nM <b>moxestrol,</b> compared with 10 nM for chicken embryo hepatocyte cultures. Both herring gull and chicken embryo hepatocyte cultures responded with significant VTG mRNA induction when treated with 10000 nM o,p'-DDT. In chicken embryo hepatocyte cultures, 4 -tert-octylphenol (OP) {{was determined to be}} very weakly estrogenic, whereas TCDD, benzo[k]fluoranthene (B[k]F), three halogenated dimethyl bipyrroles (HDBPs) and an extract prepared from a common tern (Sterna hirundo) egg were determined to be anti-estrogenic. These results indicate that the semi-quantitative avian RT-PCR VTG mRNA bioassay may be useful for predicting whether wild birds may be sensitive (or exposed) to estrogenic or anti-estrogenic environmental contaminants...|$|E
40|$|The nuclear receptors, steroid and {{xenobiotic}} receptor (SXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) play important {{functions in}} mediating lipid and drug metabolism in the liver. The present study demonstrates modulatory actions of estrogen in transactivations of SXR-mediated liver X receptor response element (LXRE) and CAR-mediated phenobarbital response element (PBRU). When human estrogen receptor (hERα) and SXR were exogenously expressed, treatment with either rifampicin or corticosterone promoted significantly the SXR-mediated transactivation of LXRE reporter gene in HepG 2. However, combined treatment with estrogen plus either rifampicin or corticosterone resulted {{in less than}} 50 % of the mean values of the transactivation by rifampicin or corticosterone alone. Thus, {{it is suggested that}} estrogen may repress the SXR-mediated transactivation of LXRE via functional cross-talk between ER and SXR. The CAR-mediated transactivation of PBRU was stimulated by hERα in the absence of estrogen. However, the potentiation by CAR agonist, TCPOBOP, was significantly repressed by <b>moxestrol</b> in the presence of ER. Thus, ER may play both stimulatory and inhibitory roles in modulating CAR-mediated transactivation of PBRU depending on the presence of their ligands. In summary, this study demonstrates that estrogen modulates transcriptional activity of SXR and CAR in mediating transactivation of LXRE and PBRU, respectively, of the nuclear receptor target genes through functional cross-talk between ER and the corresponding nuclear receptors...|$|E
40|$|Estrogens stimulate {{growth of}} MCF- 7 breast cancer cells in {{monolayer}} culture. Possible interference of serum factors {{leading to an}} estrogen-insensitive cell growth was analyzed in various experiments carried out on serum batches producing no estradiol stimulation. Out of five estrogen conjugates, only 3 -glucurono-estradiol partly suppressed the inhibition of hydroxytamoxifen; the conjugate also reduced the estrogen receptor content of the cells, probably by a down regulation process ("processing"). Moreover, prolonged subcultures in dextran-coated charcoal-treated serum attempting to remove possible intracellular estrogens produced no growth stimulation. Interference by hormone carriers of the serum was ruled out {{by the fact that}} two strong synthetic estrogens, <b>moxestrol</b> and diethylstilbestrol with weak binding affinity for these carriers, were unstimulatory. Reduction of the carrier concentration also failed to confer any estrogen sensitivity. This lack of effect of most estrogen conjugates and serum carriers seems to contradict the hypothesis of their interference leading to an estrogen-insensitive growth. Presence in the serum of potential inhibitors towards estrogen action was also examined. Dilution of sera inducing an estrogenic stimulated growth failed to show any growth increase, either in the absence or presence of estradiol, thus excluding the possibility of a major influence of an antagonism on growth control. Moreover, clonogenic assays in soft agar eliminated the hypothesis that a difference between "active" (stimulatory with estradiol) and "inactive" serum batches may result from distinct adherence properties rather than from real growth stimulation. All of these data are consistent with the concept that serum factors which are not of estrogenic nature mediate the trophic effect of estradiol; their absence in some serum batches may lead to an estrogen-insensitive cell growth. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|These studies {{sought to}} {{determine}} if neurons in the estrogen receptor-α knockout (ERαKO) mouse brain concentrated 16 α-[125 I]iodo- 11 β-methoxy- 17 β-estradiol (125 I-estrogen), and if so, whether estrogen binding augmented the expression of progesterone receptor (PR) mRNA. Mice were injected with 125 I-estrogen and cryostat sections thaw mounted onto emulsion-coated slides. After 30 – 90 days of exposure, cells with a nuclear uptake and retention of 125 I-estrogen were observed {{in a number of}} ERαKO mouse brain regions including the preoptic nucleus and arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and amygdala, although the number of labeled cells and intensity of nuclear concentration was markedly attenuated when compared with wild-type littermates. Competition studies with excess 17 β-estradiol, diethylstilbestrol, or <b>moxestrol,</b> but not with R 5020 or dihydrotestosterone, prevented the nuclear concentration of 125 I-estrogen. To determine if the low level of estrogen binding was capable of regulating gene expression, in situ hybridization was used to evaluate PR mRNA in the brain. ERαKO and wild-type mice were ovariectomized and treated with vehicle or 17 β-estradiol, and brains were sectioned and hybridized with a PR cRNA probe. Analysis of hybridization signal revealed a similar, low level of PR mRNA in ovariectomized wild-type and homozygous mice, and a marked increase in expression after treatment of ovariectomized animals with 17 β-estradiol, with the level of hybridization signal being significantly higher in wild-type animals when compared with ERαKO mice. The results demonstrate that estrogen binds in the ERαKO brain and is capable of modulating PR gene expression, thus supporting the presence and functionality of a nonclassical estrogen receptor...|$|E
40|$|Sebaceous glands were {{isolated}} by manual dissection {{under a microscope}} from surgical specimens of scalp skin with male pattern baldness and skin specimens of hairy and bald scalp obtained at autopsy. The 800 × g pellet (nuclear fraction) and the 164, 000 × g supernatant fraction (cytosol) of homogenates of the sebaceous glands were used for measurements of androgen binding characteristics, using dextrancoated charcoal and sucrose gradient methods. Scatchard plots showed high affinity binding for [3 H]dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and [3 H]methyltrienolone (R 1881). Nuclei prepared from bald scalp contained greater total androgen binding capacity than nuclei of hairy scalp, although Kd values of type I binding were similar (0. 68 vs 0. 56 nM, respectively). On sucrose gradient, the binding protein from cytosol {{was found in the}} 7 to 8 S density range. Androgen binding by cytosol of sebaceous glands of hairy scalp had Kd of 1. 89 ±. 79 and 2. 05 ±. 56 nM for DHT and R 1881, respectively, and Bmax of 18. 7 ± 4. 4 and 20. 0 ± 4. 6 fmol/mg protein for DHT and R 1881, respectively. Cytosol from sebaceous glands of bald scalp had Kd values approximately half those of hairy scalp, and Bmax values 50 %– 100 % higher. The bound 3;H labeled DHT and R 1881 could be partially displaced by testosterone (40 – 50 %), <b>moxestrol</b> (28 – 32 %), promegestone (19 – 26 %), and Δ 4 -androstenedione (6 – 12 %), but not by dehydroepiandrosterone. These data demonstrate the presence of specific androgen binding protein in sebaceous glands, and that sebaceous glands of bald scalp have greater binding affinity and capacity for androgens than those in hairy scalp. This difference may explain the greater androgenic response in androgenic alopecia...|$|E
