25|$|Questioning {{was carried}} out by various <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> at {{different}} times, rather than all seven senators being present at all times. However, <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> was very much dominated by Smith, who personally conducted <b>the</b> questioning <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key witnesses. This caused some tension among <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> and made him a number of enemies, as it was interpreted as an attempt to seize the limelight. It resulted in some <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> only attending <b>the</b> hearings infrequently as there was little for them to do.|$|R

The committee successfully negotiated with the Federal government to have that clause voted on separately, so that Virginians would accept and ratify the new constitution and so rejoin the Union. He died on February 11, 1888, and was buried at Cobbs, Chesterfield County.|$|E

5|$|Crittenden's {{support of}} a new {{election}} was both popular and politically expedient. When the U.S. Senate term of Martin D.

Though he was {{the youngest member of}} the body, he served as the second-ever chairman of the newly created Committee on the Judiciary. He was also a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on Naval Affairs. During his term, he introduced legislation to reimburse and indemnify persons who were fined under the 1798 Sedition Act.

5|$|Thorium Ltd, {{a company}} half owned by ICI that was {{involved}} in the production of radioactive substances, and was a consultant to the British nuclear energy program.

5|$|After Preston won an FA Cup {{match against}} Upton Park in 1884, the Londoners protested, seeking the result to be {{overturned}} due to professionalism in the Preston ranks. This sparked {{a series of}} events which threatened to split the FA. Under Sudell's instruction, Preston withdrew from the competition. Fellow Lancashire clubs Burnley and Great Lever followed suit. The protest gathered momentum, to the point where more than 30 clubs, predominantly from the north, announced that they would set up a rival British Football Association if the FA did not permit professionalism. At the FA conference called to discuss the issue, Sudell was a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee.</b> He argued passionately for the acceptance of professionalism, but met opposition from southern-based amateur clubs, who viewed sport solely as a pastime. Backed by figures such as the more moderate but influential William McGregor of Aston Villa, the advocates of professionalism won the day and secured its acceptance. However, each club was permitted to only pay players who had been born or who had lived within six miles of the home stadium for at least two years.|$|E
