5|$|Chitinozoa (singular: chitinozoan, plural: chitinozoans) are a taxon of flask-shaped, organic walled marine microfossils {{produced}} by an as yet unknown animal. Common from the Ordovician to Devonian periods (i.e. the mid-Paleozoic), the millimetre-scale organisms are abundant {{in almost all}} types of <b>marine</b> <b>sediment</b> across the globe. This wide distribution, and their rapid pace of evolution, makes them valuable biostratigraphic markers.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich events appear {{related to}} some, but not all, {{of the cold}} periods {{preceding}} the rapid warming events known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events, which are best recorded in the NGRIP Greenland ice core.

5|$|The strict {{definition}} of Heinrich events is the climatic event causing the IRD layer observed in <b>marine</b> <b>sediment</b> cores from the North Atlantic: a massive collapse of northern hemisphere ice shelves {{and the consequent}} release of a prodigious volume of icebergs. By extension, the name Heinrich events can also refer to the associated climatic anomalies registered at other places around the globe, at approximately the same time periods. The events are rapid: they last probably less than a millennium, a duration varying from one event to the next, and their abrupt onset may occur in mere years (Maslin et al. 2001). Heinrich events are clearly observed in many North Atlantic <b>marine</b> <b>sediment</b> cores covering the last glacial period; the lower resolution of the sedimentary record before this point {{makes it more difficult}} to deduce whether they occurred during other glacial periods in the Earth's history. Some (Broecker 1994, Bond & Lotti 1995) identify the Younger Dryas event as a Heinrich event, which would make it event H0 (table, right).|$|E
40|$|Decomposition {{conditions}} of methane hydrate in <b>marine</b> <b>sediments</b> from South China Sea were measured using multi-step decomposition method. Four different {{samples of the}} <b>marine</b> <b>sediments</b> {{were used in the}} experiments. The pore distribution, the surface area, particle size and the surface texture were measured and observed. The experimental results indicated that the final decomposition temperatures are shifted lower than those for bulk hydrates at the same pressure for different <b>marine</b> <b>sediments</b> and different water saturations. Temperature shifts are more negative for smaller initial water saturation. The surface textures and pore of the sediments both affect the equilibrium condition of methane hydrate. Using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, the enthalpy of hydrate dissociation in <b>marine</b> <b>sediments</b> was calculated. It was found that the enthalpy of hydrate dissociation in <b>marine</b> <b>sediments</b> with lower water saturation is higher than that at the bulk state. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Branched {{glycerol}} dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are membrane lipids {{produced by}} soil bacteria and occur in near coastal <b>marine</b> <b>sediments</b> {{as a result}} of soil organic matter input. Their abundance relative to marine-derived crenarchaeol, quantified in the BIT index, generally decreases offshore. However, in distal <b>marine</b> <b>sediments,</b> low relative amounts of brGDGTs can often still be observed. Sedimentary in situ production as well as dust input have been suggested as potential, though as yet not well constrained, sources. In this study brGDGT distributions in dust were examined and compared with those in distal <b>marine</b> <b>sediments.</b> Dust was sampled along the equatorial West African coast and brGDGTs were detected in most of the samples, albeit in low abundance. Their degree of methylation and cyclisation, expressed in the MBT' (methylation index of branched tetraethers) and DC (degree of cyclisation) indices, respectively, were comparable with those for African soils, their presumed source. Comparison of DC index values for brGDGTS in global soils, Congo deep-sea river fan sediments and dust with those of distal <b>marine</b> <b>sediments</b> clearly showed, however, that distal <b>marine</b> <b>sediments</b> had significantly higher values. This distinctive distribution is suggestive of sedimentary in situ production as a source of brGDGTs in <b>marine</b> <b>sediments,</b> rather than dust input. The presence of in situ produced brGDGTs in <b>marine</b> <b>sediments</b> means that caution should be exercised when applying the MBT'-CBT palaeothermometer to sediments with low BIT index values, i. e. < 0. 1, based on our dataset. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

5|$|Many {{substances}} {{enter the}} sea {{as a result}} of human activities. Combustion products are transported in the air and deposited through precipitation. Agricultural, industrial, and sewage outflows contribute heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs, disinfectants, cleaning products, and other synthetic chemicals.

25|$|During the Quaternary Period, {{the total}} volume of land ice, sea level, and global {{temperature}} has fluctuated initially on 41,000- and more recently on 100,000-year time scales, as evidenced most clearly by ice cores for the past 800,000 years and <b>marine</b> <b>sediment</b> cores for the earlier period. Over the past 740,000 years there have been eight glacial cycles. The entire Quaternary Period, starting 2.58 Ma, {{is referred to as}} an ice age because at least one permanent large ice sheet—the Antarctic ice sheet—has existed continuously. There is uncertainty over how much of Greenland was covered by ice during the previous and earlier interglacials. During the colder episodes—referred to as glacial periods—large ice sheets at least 4km thick at their maximum also existed in Europe, North America, and Siberia. The shorter and warmer intervals between glacials are referred to as interglacials.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} Jurassic, {{extension}} {{at the west}} Australian margin initiated simple shear mechanics creating a system of listric normal faults near the eastern region of the Exmouth Plateau. These listric faults were a product from {{the development of a}} major low angle detachment fault between a sedimentary base of Permian-Triassic upper crust and the mid-crustal horizon. As a result, brittle deformation and crustal thinning in the upper crust of the eastern Exmouth Plateau occurred, while in the west, the lower crystalline crust and lithosphere experienced shear stress and thinning. The formation of the fault system closer to the coast caused the initial development of the Exmouth, Barrow, and Dampier sub-basins of the Northern Carnarvon Basin. Carbonate <b>marine</b> <b>sediment,</b> primarily marls, continued to be deposited at this time on the central and western portions of the plateau. Closer to the shoreline siliciclastic mud and silt were deposited from marine and deltaic environments.|$|E

25|$|The area {{includes}} {{a variety of}} landscape formations. Districts close to the Volcanic Plateau are higher and more rugged, often subject to harsh temperatures in winter. The Manawatu District has a much gentler topography, consisting mainly of the flat, tree-studded Manawatu Plains that run between the ranges and the sea. The land was under the sea till about 500,000 years ago and still has a very thick layer of <b>marine</b> <b>sediment,</b> which is {{about five or six}} million years old. A block faulting system underneath the thick sediment has raised a series of domes and gentle depressions. These structures can provide natural storage areas for oil and some of the Manawatu domes have been drilled. The domes have shaped the course of the Manawatu River, giving it a meandering path which, uniquely among New Zealand rivers, begins close to the east coast and exits on the west coast. The Manawatu River begins just inside the Hawke's Bay region, then flows through a deep gorge to the Manawatu Plains before exiting in the Tasman Sea. The river is also unique in New Zealand (and rare worldwide) in that this gorge (the Manawatu Gorge) is a water gap through recently uplifted rock, causing the river to flow from relatively low-lying land along an eroded course through higher terrain. The Whanganui District is more rugged, with canyon-like valleys and gorges carved out of the soft rock by rivers and ocean waves.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, the Navy {{discovered}} nine metals, two semi-volatile {{organic compounds}} and a polychlorinated biphenyl in Ford Island's soil, groundwater and <b>marine</b> <b>sediment.</b> Suspected sources were nine [...] fuel tanks on the east-central {{side of the}} island (from 1924 to 1954), a [...] landfill on the southwestern shore (from 1930 to 1960) and ordnance bunkers on the northeastern side. An investigation suggested covering the contaminated areas with clean soil. In 1994, the Navy considered removing the contaminated soil and installed six wells to monitor groundwater, but decided to follow the original recommendation in 1995 and capped the contaminated soil with topsoil and erosion-resistant vegetation (including Bermuda grass).

2500|$|Bath Stone is an oolitic {{limestone}} comprising granular fragments of calcium carbonate laid down during the Jurassic Period (195 to 135 million years ago) when {{the region that}} is now Bath was under a shallow sea. Layers of <b>marine</b> <b>sediment</b> were deposited, and individual spherical grains were coated with lime as they rolled around the sea bed, forming the Bathonian Series of rocks. Under the microscope, these grains or ooliths (egg stones) are sedimentary rock formed from ooids: spherical grains composed of concentric layers. That name derives from the Hellenic word òoion for egg. [...] Strictly, oolites consist of ooids of diameter 0.25–2mm. Rocks composed of ooids larger than 2mm are called pisolites. They frequently contain minute fragments of shell or rock, and sometimes even decayed skeletons of marine life.

2500|$|A {{hypothesis}} {{published in}} 2014 posits that a genus of anaerobic methanogenic archaea known as Methanosarcina {{was responsible for}} the event. Three lines of evidence suggest that these microbes acquired a new metabolic pathway via gene transfer at about that time, enabling them to efficiently metabolize acetate into methane. That would have led to their exponential reproduction, allowing them to rapidly consume vast deposits of organic carbon that had accumulated in the <b>marine</b> <b>sediment.</b> The result would have been a sharp buildup of methane and carbon dioxide in the Earth's oceans and atmosphere, in a manner that may be consistent with the 13C/12C isotopic record.
