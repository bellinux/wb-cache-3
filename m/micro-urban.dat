High energy import rates make both countries viably engaged {{in research on}} renewable resources, also green planning policy has been proposed. Population is concentrated in the major cities which are facing energy deficiency issues. The unregulated development of <b>micro-urban</b> areas is underestimated in both cases so are the energy issues bound with them. Centralized energy sources require long distance wires to support remote areas. The proposed urban idea consists of energy resource decentralization by detailed focus on <b>micro-urban</b> development through the combination of accurate hydro distribution system for direct energy production {{in a place of}} consumption {{as a part of the}} autarchic <b>micro-urban</b> grids arranged in “efficiency electric power grid circles “ calculated by loses in wiring. This urban energy model binds <b>micro-urban</b> structures in one solid network and at the same time creates local smart energy communities built up on each individual dwelling unit that can produce energy for itself from renewable resources locally available and support the local <b>micro-urban</b> public grid or even support nearest city public grid. Hydro energy is so far the most common, stable and efficient renewable resource in use. Water turbine’s efficiency has gone up to 96 %. Proposed new multi-purpose small hydro type is one of the preliminary small scale systems that could be precisely tailored to <b>micro-urban</b> demands. It could stand by for direct use if needed and also use various types of working mediums (e. g. compressed gas, steam, water) ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Extreme heat events (EHE) are of {{increasing}} public health concern. In urban areas, <b>micro-urban</b> heat islands (MUHI) raise {{the possibility of}} increased mortality risk. This study identified MUHI {{in the city of}} Barcelona, Spain, using Landsat 7 thermal infrared imagery and overlaid them onto at-home deaths between 2000 - 2003, identified from a mortality registry and geocoded using the Google API. Hot days were defined as days with mean minimum temperatures above the 90 th percentile of historic temperatures. Data were analyzed using a case-only design, with a logistic regression model adjusted for spatial autocorrelation. Results: In the period 2000 - 2003, at-home deaths in MUHI were associated with 15 % greater odds of dying on hot days than at-home deaths outside of MUHI. Conclusions: MUHI were a risk factor for at-home deaths during EHE in the study period (2000 - 2003) in the city of Barcelona. In urban areas facing similar conditions (limited use of air-conditioning, among others), residents of MUHI may be at increased mortality risk during extreme heat events...|$|E

The simulation workflow moves from a <b>micro-urban</b> to a building scale assessment by linking the ENVI-met software to the building energy simulation program EnergyPlus.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 18002 ̆ 7 s, {{many studies have}} {{recognized}} increased heat in urban areas, known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect, {{as one of the}} results of human modification to the natural landscape. UHI is related to differences in land surface temperature (LST) between rural areas and urban areas where factors of the built environment such as the thermodynamic capacities of materials, structural geometry, and heat generating activities cause increased storage and re-radiation of heat to the atmosphere. This thesis examines the correlation between factors of urbanization and differences in land surface temperature (LST) in the subtropical climate of Pinellas County, Florida using remote sensing techniques. It describes the spatial pattern of LST, analyzes its relationship to factors of urbanization relative to NDVI, percentage of impervious surface, and land use land cover in the study area. It also assesses the effectiveness of remote sensing as an efficient method of identifying LST patterns at the local and neighborhood level for mitigation strategies. Landsat TM thermal band imagery for three dates; April 1986, 2001 and 2009 was processed using Qin 2 ̆ 7 s mono-window algorithm (MWA) technique to derive LST levels. This data was compared to in-situ readings, then normalized and statistically analyzed for correlation with vegetation ratio (NDVI) and imperviousness percentages derived using linear spectral mixing/unmixing, and also with land use/land cover classification. The resulting LST spatial pattern is a gradient across the peninsular landscape, from cooler water and wetland areas to a generally warmer interior, interspersed with <b>micro-urban</b> heat islands (MUHIs), corresponding to urban structures and 2 ̆ 2 cool-islands 2 ̆ 2 of parkland and lakes. Correspondence between LST pattern and urban structures and land use demonstrates the suitability of medium resolution remote sensing data and techniques for identifying <b>micro-urban</b> heat islands (MUHIs) for possible mitigation. Mitigation could include relatively low-cost measures like replacement of inefficient asphalt roofs with more reflective and emissive 2 ̆ 2 cool roofs, 2 ̆ 2 placement of 2 ̆ 2 street trees 2 ̆ 2 to enhance shade, and replacement of impervious pavements by permeable surfaces. The thesis concludes that Landsat TM imagery processed with the MWA provides an efficient, relatively low-cost method for locating MUHIs. Satellite remote sensing, combined with aerial photography can facilitate neighborhood level analysis for the implementation of low-cost mitigation techniques. Previous studies have demonstrated that these are successful ways to mitigate the UHI effect at the micro-scale level; lowering urban heat and saving energy, and also facilitating the reintegration of natural elements into the urban environment...|$|E

Those indicators link the sharing of structure between subproblems (“commonality”) to recursive recombination, measured as freshness of the search wake and novelty of the search moves, and can be of assistance in devising search structures suitable for being search efficiently. This is because they bring some memory of the search history to algorithms which otherwise would have not one.

In such high-density living conditions, {{the provision of}} open space at neighborhood level is of vital importance to enable residents to enjoy {{better quality of life}} with the social, psychological and environmental benefits that open spaces can bring. However, when designing these public spaces, the effect of the overall build forms on the microclimate conditions need to be considered. Only when the conditions allow for human comfort would these spaces serve to promote sustainability. One significant factor having adverse effect on human comfort is heat stress.

40|$|All {{around the}} world, old harbor areas stood empty once the city {{maritime}} functions began to wane {{in the early}} twentieth-century. Due to the excellent views, the location on the water, and the proximity to the city center, these areas have been rapidly redeveloped to facilitate urban expansion {{in the last three}} decades. The overlap of industrial decline and new revitalization has prompted new issues. Living in the city and urban demographics are changing. On the macro-level, because of the emptiness of the newly developed site, the density is not comparable and is difficult to evaluate in its integrated context. On the micro-level, an urban apartment is highly efficient means to provide living containers for urban dwellers; however, it sacrifices high living quality to enjoy sunlight, fresh air, the view, and private garden to every housing unit. A single family house symbolizes a success of personal life; however, it compromises urban public space and usually is exclusive to social activities in a shared economic era.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the solar radiation mapping technique {{used in the}} application of ELaR, a methodology and integrated tools to support sustainable design options in rehabilitation projects. In particular the paper explains how Geographic Information Systems can be used to map the solar radiation incident on the roof and facades of existing buildings at the <b>micro-urban</b> scale and how such maps can help to facilitate the diffusion of passive heating and cooling techniques in the energetic/environmental upgrading of existing buildings. ELaR stands for Ecodynamic Land Register, a tool to help designer to evaluate sustainability through energy and material flows analysis (Daly H. E. 1990). The specific information system developed is based on the geometric structure of the land cadastre and allows to evaluate different design options in term of amount of input and output flows activated to sustain the activities related to building uses. From the practical point of view the methodology is based on the use of two specific synergetic tools: - A Geographic Information System, with the main aim to elaborate specific thematic maps, which represent the existing environmental conditions of the local area; such maps include information on potential local renewable resources and on the geometrical configuration of the existing buildings.

The threats of diseases such as SARS in densely populated cities {{suggests that it is}} mandatory to integrate urban climatologically indicators into urban design of our cities. Such integration will not only help to improve living condition and healthy environment; it can also serve as a means to quantify energy savings and environmental benefits for purpose of planning policies of land resources. In Hong Kong, nearly 60 % of electrical energy use is for space conditioning during summer months. This paper describes findings of an ongoing research project at the University of Hong Kong that investigates the impact of design-related variables on outdoor micro level daytime heat island effect in residential developments that have in turn an impact on the mode and pattern of air conditioning energy consumption. The study hypothesizes that differences in outdoor temperatures within and between residential developments {{can be explained by the}} impact of design related variables on the overall environment. Any studies on environmental issues should be stratified to incorporate geographical and seasonal variation. The study covers several high-rise high-density residential areas, including mixed development urban blocks in inner city as well as coastal developments. The findings of the study will lead to specific environmental design guidelines in terms of density, building height, massing, and vegetation. These guidelines would help practitioners to make design decisions at <b>micro-urban</b> and urban scales. The overall impact of any physical development in urban residential areas of Hong Kong and other similar Asian cities can also be analyzed accordingly. These guidelines will help designers to quantify crucial factors for low energy urban design at the concept design stage itself and mitigate UHI in the long term for subtropical climate cities. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

Conceptualizing these HSR-linked regions as a string of interconnected cities, the research explores added accessibility in these linked cities and shows HSR time-space effects functionally move some cities into other cities' commuting areas. Here, case studies of four different, but analogous, proposed HSR stops in two countries-Portugal and the United States-reveal various insights. The cities of Coimbra and Leiria in Portugal and Champaign-Urbana and Kankakee in Illinois, with new high-speed access to Lisbon and Chicago, respectively, are analyzed to further explore the potential effects HSR could have on such communities. The research presented takes a complex systems perspective, exploring striking parallels of population and distances between the case communities, and highlights opportunities for these communities afforded by new connections to the principal cities. Ultimately, further understanding potential impacts on local communities involves multiple considerations and provides various transportation planning lessons. This work shows how particular investment will serve to reinforce and potentially accelerate the growth of regions, metropolitan areas, and create new <b>micro-urban</b> centers. Via further market integration into the principal metropolitan areas, economic development {{and quality of life}} shifts become possible. Using a conceptual methodological framework to quantitatively assess agglomerative benefits, the research shows that HSR improves the potential for agglomeration growth over the best existing travel mode by approximately 25 % to 125 % in Portugal and 15 % to 150 % in Illinois amongst the case communities. by Ryan J.

The strength of this new tool {{is the ability to}} activate public/private partnerships in order to bring on projects of social housing and co-housing on abandoned private buildings with the control and guide of the public administration. The proposed process has the following purposes: acting on private areas, smaller than 15. 000 sqm, retrofitting abandoned industrial and tertiary buildings, improving the environmental and urban landscape quality, preserving areas covered by public standards, providing practical assessment tools, integrating social housing and co-housing, promoting functional mix, multi-functionality and flexibility, encouraging neighbour’s inclusion and active participation, fostering the awareness in environmental issues and participatory planning, supporting <b>micro-urban</b> regenerations. The method is based on the synergy of fundamental economic, social and environmental factors (recognizable internationally as the four dimensions of sustainability) in order to reach an unedited breakthrough in the institutional dimension. The tool allows the involved stakeholders to draft a meta-project in compliance with the adopted procedure previsions. The meta-project assessment has to be done on the base of different perspectives: economic (life cycle cost, global cost); social (Social Return on investment); environmental impact, in accordance with specific indicators identified in response to the application. The outcome is a regulatory tool for the integration and implementation of the current Italian regulations. It is based on the principle of “anticipation of decisions" and is able to overcome the limits of the current legislation that provides for an official assessment only when the project is almost whole developed and proceeded.

The NSW Department of Housing (DoH) faces increasingly complex problems requiring a balanced consideration of social, environmental and economic factors. Sometimes, these challenges present wicked problems in which no absolute solution exists, requiring on-going communication and mediation between a range of stakeholders. The limitations of the systems currently in use at DoH are being revealed at a <b>micro-urban</b> (sub-cadastral) level. This presents the opportunity to test the emerging technologies surrounding three-dimensional urban visualisation {{with regard to the}} DoH situation. Community regeneration targets areas with the most pressing challenges and a longterm focus is encouraged to best ensure sustainability. In these time frames, the geographic location of the focus area {{is one of the few}} constants. Establishing a foundation of geospatial data and protocols feeds on to create richer information systems and explicit knowledge frameworks that are pivotal for providing a high quality of support for spatial decisions. These challenges and opportunities are internationally unique and, as such, this research makes an original and essential contribution to the body of knowledge. The thesis begins by analysing the public housing context in NSW and positions the research amongst international parallels. A literature review has been structured according to the hierarchy of data, information and knowledge. The theory surrounding the built environment, community decision-making, and digital technology is examined and critically focuses on dangers and ethical concerns the above realm provokes. DoH staff were then interviewed during an information gathering phase and subsequently, a working prototype SDSS has been built and tested and applied to four case-study areas presenting a diversity of built environs and community types. The prototype modules were then tested with DoH staff and community members in a testing and user evaluation phase. The thesis concludes with a discussion covering the future directions and research gaps a threedimensional SDSS brings to the management of public housing and interaction with the communities involved. Recommendations are proposed along with speculation as to how appropriate the SDSS model is to other government departments with similar portfolios...|$|E
40|$|The {{company town}} of Crespi d’Adda, {{inserted}} in the UNESCO World Heritage List since 1995, needs new attentions to ensure the preservation {{and the development of}} buildings as well as of its own territorial area. The houses and the public buildings require suitable maintenance and redevelopment interventions, even under preservation logics. Factory buildings, today completely in disuse, ask for new destinations for new economic cycles. From the social point of view, since characteristics of the resident inhabitants changed through the years, at the moment it’s not possible a proper generation turnover without the introduction of new occupational markets together with a redevelopment of networks and community services. On the other hand, from a tourist point of view, there are wide possibilities to increase the offer, especially for the cultural related one. The Management Plan, as set and requested by UNESCO as the instrument aimed to govern the necessary changes, consists in a structured programme which will be developed through the years in relation to the amount and to the resources quality that will be provided by the subjects involved in the programme. Therefore the most suitable strategy, to lead the company town of Crespi d’Adda and its territory towards necessary and evolutionary processes - no more possible to postpone - controlled and consistent with its history and its values, seems to request a review of the whole residential system according to renewed and maybe original valuations of its potential and capacity.

40|$|AbstractThe {{terms of}} ‘modernization’ and ‘modernity’ {{have been called}} into {{question}} not only in their French uses, but also in Italian, English and German. This questioning is largely based on historians adopting and using arguments which originate in the economic and anthropological disciplines. To our great regret, the term of modernisation has very much become a taboo amongst historians. Without going into great detail, {{we would like to}} outline the two main types of opposition:On the one hand, the term of modernisation is criticised because it is thought to impose hierarchy of values and an image of ‘progress’ and of society which is not well adapted to the society of the 19 th Century. This is the easiest criticism to refute as it takes a caricature of historiography as its starting point and puts forward a kind of anthropological refusal of modernisation in the name of consideration of inequalities and balance of power. But on the other hand, and more fundamentally, it is the nature of economic and moral representation of the 19 th Century transition to liberal capitalism which is important, especially when it suggests that the market economy had already penetrated the countryside, and this independently of generalisation of urban models. While the economic and social domains have seen the meanings of modernisation and its links with the State called into question, it seems difficult to reject its political and cultural significance and this fundamental coupling by Eugen Weber is reused in recent works about European countryside. The debate around the role of the State in rural politicization, based on readings of Eugen Weber's classical book Peasants into Frenchmen. The modernization of rural France (1870 – 1914) goes a lot further than the simple question of the efficiency of the administration and the limits of the image of those who represented it: it directly concerns the virtual integration into the State and the role of rural elites between that which is local and that which is national. With using “politicization”, we intend to emphasize, on the one hand, the steps of the national integration of the whole rural society after 1830 and, on the other hand, the political acculturation of the peasants, their positive interpretation of citizenship, their own political agenda (learning to use the ballot after 1848 and adopting the mechanisms of political and not only social conflicts). The aim of our paper is to consider the part played by the State and the “rural elites” in the political modernization of european countryside from 1830 to 1914 by comparing the European situation. With the terms of “rural elites”, we want to pursue the question of the relationships between social power and political influence with exploring the diversity of “rural elites” through the three following meanings: a) the traditional “notable” defined by “fear, respect, sympathy and dependency” (Eugen Weber) b) the mediators of rural society the “élite” as an intermediary class between peasantry and middle-class, between rural and <b>micro-urban</b> society (Henri Mendras) c) {{the emergence of a new}} group of local and national political leaders coming from the peasantry...|$|E
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2007 an Italian Urban Simulation Laboratory was founded at the Politecnico di Milano. The laboratory, coordinated by prof. Fausto Curti, has been developed thanks to the one year presence of the visiting professor Peter Bosselmann, director of the Environmental Simulation Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley. The laboratory has an interdisciplinary approach and a threefold mission: experiment, using the laboratory setting to study urban projects at different scales, communicate, aiding public communication by making urban projects understandable to everyone, integrate and innovate, working on different kind of simulations techniques in an integrated way. In its initial experience the laboratory is primarily a didactic and research facility. Students can join the work and participate actively to the research. Until now about 40 students have worked with us, {{more than a half}} were foreign students from all over the world. The majority of the students did an internship of about 150 (three-year degree) or 300 (master degree) hours and some of them have continued working after this period developing a thesis. At the moment the case study, used as a pilot research, is about the Porta Nuova project at the Garibaldi- Repubblica area in Milan. The 300. 000 mq of the total area and its well served central position make this place strategic for Milan. In this area the adopted urban transformation plan is creating a new business center that affects redevelopment projects, new infrastructures, and a park. The overall project will overhanging the surroundings city center with some of the highest buildings of its skyline. The importance of the site and the dimension of the project make this case significant to test the use of simulation for supporting evaluations about morphological aspects, comfort conditions, visual impacts, and other aspects that directly influence the quality of the new urban spaces. We are now applying different simulation methodologies in order to better understand the peculiar usefulness of each kind as a tool to support evaluation. As any kind has its own limits we work with different typologies at the same time. We are working with 1 : 500 scale physical model of a 1 km square of the area and different kind of static and dynamic simulations. We developed, with an external office, a micro-car to move a micro-camera in the maquette. We use this equipment to better explain the project implications to the students by producing subjective shot videos or showing a walk in real-time. To reproduce in a better way some relevant walks through the transformed site we have also produced some videos made of a superimposition of the real existing context and the virtual projects. To do this we used a rendered video of the project superimposed to the filmed promenade of the today condition, previously recorded using steadycam. A lot of static simulations has been employed to better understand the new city configuration from some representative points of view, as for example the roof of the Duomo cathedral. We are now developing some other kinds of analysis such as shadows impact, this is done by using a 1 : 1000 scale maquette in the Heliodon, but also with some digital tools. In the next future a work with the wind tunnel will help to understand some other comfort implications of the project at the <b>micro-urban</b> scale. The multilayer approach is the main aim of the laboratory and is an important tool to clarify the multidimensional project impacts to the students. In this way the laboratory can be a learning tool, it can stimulate the project process and support decision-making while improving the knowledge about the correct use of simulations for evaluating the cumulative implications of the proposed urban processes...|$|E
