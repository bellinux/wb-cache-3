5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} while we were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When our mother died, it was as though <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It was a bit much.|$|E
500|$|Depp {{created his}} own image of Todd. Heavy purple and brown make-up was applied around his eyes to suggest fatigue and rage, as if [...] "he's never slept". Burton said of the {{character}} Sweeney Todd, [...] "We always saw him as a sad character, not a tragic villain or anything. He's basically a dead person when you meet him; the only thing that's keeping him going is the one single minded thing which is tragic. You don't see anything else around him." [...] Depp said of the character, [...] "He makes Sid Vicious look like the innocent paper boy. He's beyond dark. He's already dead. He's been dead for years." [...] Depp also commented on the streak of white in Todd's hair, saying, [...] "The idea was that he'd had this hideous trauma, from being sent away, locked away. That streak of white hair became the shock of that rage. It represented his rage over what had happened. It's certainly {{not the first time}} anyone's used it. But it's effective. It tells a story all by itself. <b>My</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> a white spot growing up, and his son has this kind of shock of white in his hair." ...|$|E
2500|$|By early 1965, [...] Millington and {{her sister}} Jean formed The Svelts, an all-female rock band, with June on rhythm guitar, Jean on bass, Kathy Terry on drums, and Cathy Carter on guitar. According to Millington, the band's name, [...] "came from a word <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> just learned in school. To be svelte: thin, lithe. It sounded like {{what we wanted to}} be, kinda classy!". [...] The Svelts rehearsed {{initially}} in Terry's living room in Sacramento. Managed and promoted by Richard [...] "Dick" [...] Leventon (born January 4, 1938; died September 30, 1991), The Svelts performed at sock hops, air force bases, and frat parties and gradually built a following. In November 2012, Millington recalled: ...|$|E
5000|$|As stated earlier, I do NOT own any company/property abroad. <b>My</b> <b>brother</b> <b>has</b> made me {{a trustee}} {{in one of his}} {{corporations}} which only entitles me to distribute assets to <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> Hussain's family/children if needed. Nothing more than what <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>has</b> already explained. The info provided by leaks does NOT say any wrongdoing involved. Distortion is wilful that a couple of media channels using to settle scores.|$|R

60|$|Lady Hester came every day. <b>My</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> {{sent for}} Mr. Eagles, our solicitor, {{to meet her}} the first time, and look at her papers.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was you, and {{not your}} sister, I find, that <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> the {{pleasure}} of being acquainted with, {{when he was in}} this country." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY CAROLINE. About four years, I think, Jane. I {{know it was}} {{the same}} year in which <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> his last {{exposure}} in the evening newspapers.|$|E

6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to tell me," [...] he demanded, [...] "that <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>has</b> been decoyed here, kept here against his will, to provide {{amusement}} for your guests?" ...|$|R
60|$|My dear Captain Montgomerie, {{you really}} can't {{expect me to}} marry you because <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>has</b> been so foolish as to lose more money at poker than he can afford.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{was fully}} {{prepared}} {{to hear the}} bad news,' he explained, 'which my man Robertson told me when I arrived. The letter I got last night was a bogus one; {{there is no such}} person as J. Collins, M.D. <b>My</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> never felt better in his life. You will, I am sure, very soon trace the cunning writer of that epistle--ah! but I was in a rage, I can tell you, when I got to the Metropole at Brighton, and found that Emile, <b>my</b> <b>brother,</b> <b>had</b> never heard of any Doctor Collins.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've seen six-shooters before now," [...] {{said the}} girl, evading the proffered weapon and its suggestion. [...] "Dad has one, and <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> two derringers {{before he was}} half as big as me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, sir. I {{never heard}} of either one of 'em," [...] said Harry, hanging down his head. [...] "I fear my book-learning was {{neglected}} at home, sir. <b>My</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> read every book that ever was wrote, I think. He could have talked to you about 'em for hours together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I have comprehended, honest Hamlin," [...] said Don Jose slowly, [...] "this Roberto, {{who was my}} vaquero and is <b>my</b> <b>brother,</b> <b>has</b> {{approached}} this faro game {{by himself}} unsolicited?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely, Meeson," [...] added John, [...] "you have {{sufficient}} {{respect for the}} dignity of the law not to tamper with it in any such way as <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>has</b> indicated?" ...|$|R
6000|$|When Mr. Trumbull had {{departed}} {{with a fine}} bow, Solomon, leaning forward, observed to his sister, [...] "You may depend, Jane, <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>has</b> left that girl a lumping sum." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We always knew," [...] she said, [...] "that <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> {{married an}} addle-pated, silly woman, {{one of the}} most unsuited to be the {{mistress}} of a clergyman's house that ever a man set eyes on; but I didn't think she'd allow herself to be led into such a stupid thing as this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon me," [...] he said; [...] "I am not able, even yet, {{to speak}} composedly of my brother's death. Let me {{only say that}} the poor young wife was a widow, before the happy days of the honeymoon were over. That dreadful {{calamity}} struck her down. Before <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> been committed to the grave, her life was in danger from brain-fever." ...|$|E
60|$|I made my {{way into}} the little sitting-room which belonged to the suite of rooms <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> placed at my disposal. There I rang up Lord Frederic Maynard, my first cousin, and a junior member of the government. The butler told me that Lord Frederic was dining, but would doubtless speak {{to me for a}} moment. In a minute or two I heard his {{familiar}} voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is what we}} {{have met}} to talk about," [...] {{returned}} Nehow. [...] "I would hear what <b>my</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>have</b> to say. When they have spoken I will open my mouth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell him," [...] {{answered}} Sir Henry, [...] "that I {{go because}} I {{believe that a}} man of <b>my</b> blood, <b>my</b> <b>brother,</b> <b>has</b> gone there before me, and I journey to seek him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Only this, father, dear father. You {{shall not}} be tormented any more, if only you will tell him that <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>has</b> made Eustacie his wife, then will I do all the rest.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "White becomes {{her better}} than {{anything}} else," [...] said Irene significantly. [...] "And we all know black doesn't suit her complexion at all. But of course I'm not saying {{that is the reason}} she doesn't wear it. Only, it's funny. If <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> died I'd have gone into deep mourning. I wouldn't have had the heart for anything else. I confess I'm disappointed in Rilla Blythe." ...|$|E
60|$|To Margaret {{was left}} {{whatever}} {{of the property}} M. Poligny would spare, and if Gaspard should have sons, one would bear the title of Ribaumont, though the name would be extinct. So it was fitting that the pearls should return to that family, and the fair value, as we hoped, sufficed, in Harry Merrycourt's hands, to redeem, in my husband's name, the inheritance <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> always destined for me.|$|E
6000|$|... "The heavenly tranquillity, {{the comforting}} {{solitude}} helped me. I saw my position and his, in their true light. Before I got back, I had decided (cost {{me what it}} might) on myself making the sacrifice to which <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> offered to submit. For Lucilla's sake, and for Nugent's sake, I felt the certain assurance {{in my own mind}} that it was my duty, and not his, to go.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, about Leigh. <b>My</b> <b>brother</b> <b>has</b> always shown a {{dislike for}} him and, {{as it is}} certain that he cannot remain here, he must either return to England or go with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, but <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>has</b> dressed up!" [...] {{cried the}} girl. [...] "Very much so. No end, if I may say so. Why he's {{bearing down on}} you now in all his glory." ...|$|R
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. That {{is just as}} well, for {{you would}} be bored to death. There has been a meeting of magistrates in the village, and <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>has</b> brought them all in to lunch.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I see {{no great}} harm in that paragraph," [...] says Sir Brian. [...] "I wish <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> {{gone to the}} Roebuck, {{and not to the}} King's Arms, as the Roebuck is our house: but he could not be {{expected}} to know much about the Newcome inns, as he is a new comer himself. And I think it was very {{right of the people to}} call on him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said Patty {{in utter}} bewilderment, [...] "I {{just went out}} to Mr. Reid's and asked for the gentleman who was visiting there--I'd {{forgotten}} his name--and Mr. Reefer came down and I told him <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> been detailed to interview him {{on behalf of the}} Chronicle about the bill, and that Clifford had missed his train, and wouldn't he let me interview him in his place and excuse my inexperience--and he did." ...|$|E
60|$|Although I could {{discover}} {{no direct}} evidence against her, I strongly suspected The Queen of Hearts of tampering with the lots {{on the fifth}} evening, to irritate Morgan by making it his turn to read again, after the shortest possible interval of repose. However that might be, the number drawn was certainly Seven, and the story to be read was consequently the story which <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>had</b> finished only two days before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say 'father.' We {{never called}} him papa; {{and if one}} of <b>my</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>had</b> {{addressed}} him as 'governor,' as boys do now, I really think he 'd have him cut off with a shilling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Could you do that, sir? If {{you could}} {{it would help}} me out a whole lot. <b>My</b> <b>brother</b> <b>has</b> {{a wife and two}} little children, and she'll be scared to death if Bill is injured." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know that, Ralph. But {{the truth}} of the matter is, <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>has</b> asked me to take his son in, just for his board and clothing, and I have consented. I couldn't do less." ...|$|R
