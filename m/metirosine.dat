50|$|<b>Metirosine</b> (INN and BAN; α-Methyltyrosine, Metyrosine USAN, AMPT) is an {{antihypertensive}} drug. It inhibits {{the enzyme}} tyrosine hydroxylase and, therefore, catecholamine synthesis, which, as a consequence, depletes {{the levels of}} the catecholamines dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline in the body.|$|E
50|$|Tyrosine hydroxylase can be {{inhibited}} by {{the drug}} α-methyl-para-tyrosine (<b>metirosine).</b> This inhibition {{can lead to a}} depletion of dopamine and norepinepherine in the brain {{due to the lack of}} the precursor L-Dopa (L-3,4-dyhydroxyphenylalanine) which is synthesized by tyrosine hydroxylase. This drug is rarely used and can cause depression, but it is useful in treating pheochromocytoma and also resistant hypertension. Older examples of inhibitors mentioned in the literature include oudenone and aquayamycin.|$|E
