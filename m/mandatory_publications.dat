These <b>mandatory</b> <b>publications</b> were sent to Members of Parliament and newspapers across Canada. They became the Parks Branch’s initial marketing tool. In the 1920s, Harkin appointed Mabel Williams to author guidebooks and literature that promoted parks as a Canadian birthright that made one physically stronger, psychologically renewed, and spiritually fulfilled. With increased tourism, the Branch could afford printing the guidebooks. Their spending in the government printing department jumped from $2000 to almost $13,000 in one year. The Parks Branch created a Publicity Division to promote Canada’s parks through guidebooks, lectures, slide presentations, and motion pictures. This successful division would later form the Canadian Government Travel Bureau and National Film Board of Canada.|$|E

However, the graduation rates established by the NCAA showed poor results, for example they reported that among students who entered college between 1993 and 1996 only 51 percent of football players graduated within 6 years and 41 percent of basketball players. Feeling pressure to improve these poor rates the NCAA instituted reforms in 2004, including the APR, a new method for gauging the academic progress of student athletes. [...] It was put into place in order to aid in the NCAA's goal for student-athletes to graduate with meaningful degrees preparing them for life. The principle data collector was Thomas Paskus, the principal research scientist for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Originally, if a program's four-year average APR fell below 925, that would trigger sanctions like scholarship losses, and a four-year APR of 900 or lower triggered [...] "historical penalties" [...] like postseason bans.

40|$|The IASB is {{presently}} {{involved in a}} project on reporting comprehensive income. Since the IASB accounting system {{is a mixture of}} two income determination methods, to wit historical cost accounting and fair value accounting, an interesting question pertains to whether the display of comprehensive income should be neutral with regard to these two competing paradigms. This paper scrutinizes, with a valuation perspective in mind, the typical arguments made by proponents of historical cost net income and comprehensive fair value income and finds that claims for exclusive reliance on a single concept of earnings are untenable. This means that a case could be made for advancing neutral income display as a policy objective. The matrix format of comprehensive income that is proposed under the IASB performance project certainly allows for such a neutral interpretation. However, given the importance of summarization in financial analysis, as is most extremely reflected in the focus on the earnings per share (EPS) number, if neutrality is to prevail, then it should also be reflected at the highest level of summarization of financial performance reporting. In other words, <b>mandatory</b> <b>publication</b> of two EPS numbers, one for net income and one for comprehensive income, should be considered. Possible effects on perception and actual use of financial reports that should enter such a consideration are suggested as topics for experimental research.

Patents are a good metric {{to determine whether the}} necessary technological progress is indeed happening, as the <b>mandatory</b> <b>publication</b> of the underlying invention gives access to otherwise hidden R&D activities. Our paper contributes to the literature with a compiled array of technological classes related to important battery types in the novel Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC), which can be used to identify relevant patent applications of the competing technologies. Using the worldwide patent statistical database (PATSTAT), we find that promising technologies such as sodium-sulfur batteries and regenerative fuel cells (e. g. redox flow batteries) show increasing patent counts during the last years. The number of patent applications for regenerative fuel cells doubled from 2009 to 2011. Nevertheless, the patenting in technologies related to lithium is unchallenged. Annual patent applications in this area have reached very high levels in 2010 and 2011, allowing the conclusion that the introduction of improved modules will continue. Our analysis underlines that electrochemical storage and in particular lithium-based technologies can be expected to play an increasingly important role in future energy systems.

40|$|This {{report was}} {{commissioned}} by the Better Regulation Delivery Office (BRDO) {{as part of a}} programme of work aimed at promoting greater sharing of business data between regulatory organisations. The research on which this report is based investigated the perceptions of regulators on the subject – i. e. their views on what promotes or inhibits data sharing. Findings and recommendations are summarised below: • There is a distinct gulf between large data-rich and small data-poor regulatory organisations. The former have the power to acquire the data they need and tend to question whether the benefits warrant the costs involved in sharing data with others. • Inequalities between the data-rich and data-poor could potentially be reduced if a codified duty and power for regulatory organisations to share data was introduced - incorporating ideally the comply-or-explain principle, to allow for operational flexibility and to avoid the need for legislation to address existing prohibitions. • Successful inter-regulator data sharing relationships are typically built upon pre- existing social and organisational networks. Regulatory organisations should consider where they have such resources and how these could be utilised to increase data-sharing where potential social and economic benefits can be shown to exist. • Type of data is critical. Technical and legal considerations make data-mining of shared datasets of even simple factual information more resource-intensive than sharing discrete intelligence on criminal noncompliance - the latter benefits from Data Protection Act exemptions and the well-established networks of regulatory intelligence staff. • Constraints on data sharing arise in part from the operation of the legal and regulatory regime governing data protection. Problems include uncertainty, complexity, and disproportionality of sanctions. A particular issue is the way the Data Protection Act overlaps with, or sometimes cuts across, statutes applying to specific public bodies. • A perception that the sanctions available under the Data Protection Act are disproportionate to the objectives of the legislation appears to be having a chilling effect on data sharing between public bodies. • A ‘National Data Strategy’, recommended in the Shakespeare Review, could help break down technical barriers to data sharing focusing perhaps on encouraging joint working on data sourcing and <b>mandatory</b> <b>publication</b> of data catalogues, as well as consideration of a new public sector data sharing standard. • Some government departments already take a lead in supporting data-sharing amongst their reporting organisations. This is helpful as realising the potential benefits from increased data sharing requires such support, particularly to overcome technology issues which disproportionately affect smaller, data-poor organisations...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} eight years, the {{registration}} of clinical trials has been strongly advocated by journals and editors, and is now considered to be <b>mandatory</b> for <b>publication</b> by most medical journals. In the United States, it became legally mandated by the Food and Drug Administration in 2007 (1), although Canada has no law requiring registration. Registration of a clinical trial ensures that the public has access to information regarding trials involving human subjects and health out-comes. Published clinical trials strongly affect decision making in health care, including decisions made at the bedside, in the boardroom and in the legislature. Therefore, the public needs {{to have access to}} the same evidence as the decision makers. Moreover, registering clin-ical trials and their protocols before data collection begins helps cor-rect the distortion created by selective reporting in the literature (ie, ‘positive publication bias’), in which only trials with positive outcomes are published. Many also believe that the research community, by using human subjects, has a moral obligation to the public to publish their findings and a registry can reveal a disconnect in communica-tion.

40|$|Doctor Legum - LLDCurrently most {{international}} investment disputes are settled through arbitration. The {{origin of}} this dispute settlement {{system can be}} associated with the recent proliferation of over 3000 Bilateral Investment Treaties. Through this system disputes are settled by autonomous and differently constituted tribunals which have powers to render final and binding awards. The dissatisfied party has very limited opportunity to challenge the rendered award as there are no higher bodies in the hierarchy where a dissatisfied party can lodge an appeal, save for limited procedural challenges which are allowed under the system. These differently constituted tribunals at times reach diametrically opposed decisions on similar facts and those decisions stand side by side and all are considered valid. These inconsistent decisions are leading to lack of consistency and uniformity which in turn affects the legitimacy of the system as a whole. The rules of these institutions do not allow the proceedings to be held in public despite the fact that at times these tribunals question the regulatory powers of the state and state measures on service provision to its citizens. Another issue under the current system is that due to lack of coordination, arbitrators play dual roles: as counsels and arbitrators. This practice compromises the cherished principle of the rule of law. In the effort to address these concerns, stakeholders have suggested a number of possible solutions. The suggested solutions include: invoking res judicata and lis pendens principles; adopting the doctrine of precedent; applying the ‘fork in the road’ principle; adopting the margin of appreciation standard in interpretation of BITs; creating an appellate structure at ICSID and creating a treaty to treaty appellate body. This research submits that, the suggested solutions singularly and cumulatively don not address the legitimacy issues adequately. The research therefore calls {{for the establishment of a}} Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) in order to address the legitimacy issues cumulatively. It is submitted that establishing a Multilateral Investment Agreement (MAI) which provides for creating a standing international investment court with an appellate court is the only solution which addresses all the issues haunting the international investment dispute settlement system. In addition, the research suggests interim solutions which will help to increase the legitimacy of the current system pending the establishment of the MAI and the courts. The interim solutions include: establishment of the investor – state dispute adjudication Centre; effective utilisation of host state courts; <b>mandatory</b> <b>publication</b> of all awards; enhancing the effective use of member states interpretative statement; and forming a working commission to provide basic interpretation and the scope of the basic international investment law principles.

We surveyed 1, 292 psychologists to address two questions: Do psychologists support these concrete changes to data collection, reporting, and publication practices, and if not, what are their reasons? Respondents also indicated the percentage of print and online journal space that should be dedicated to novel studies and direct replications as well as the percentage of published psychological research that they believed would be confirmed if direct replications were conducted.

We further evaluated methodological consistency between registration and publication. Methods We searched Clinical Trials. gov for all trials related to orthopaedic trauma. We excluded active trials and trials not completed by July 2009, and performed a systematic search for publications resulting from registered closed trials. Information regarding primary and secondary outcomes, intervention, study sponsors, and sample size were extracted from registrations and publications. Results Of 130 closed trials, 37 eligible trials resulted in 16 publications (43. 2 %). We found {{no significant differences in}} publication rates between funding sources for industry sponsored studies and nongovernment/nonindustry sponsored studies (p > 0. 05). About half the trials (45 %) did not include the NCT ID in the publication. Two (10 %) publications had major changes to the primary outcome measure and ten (52. 6 %) to sample size. Conclusions Registration of orthopaedic trauma trials does not consistently result in publication. When trials are registered, many do not cite NCT ID in the publication. Furthermore, changes that are not reflected in the registry of the trial are frequently made to the final publication. </p...|$|R
