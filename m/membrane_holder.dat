40|$|Effective and {{sustainable}} environmental monitoring is fundamental for environmental pro-tection measures and research. The mass spectrometer {{used in these}} cases for identification and quantification of particles is inter alia made of a sample inlet system (SIS), which has to be both very pressure-resistant, and very permeable for an optimal registration of parti-cles in the deep sea. In this work, pore structures of diatoms are examined, which also have a high permeability and compressive strength due to the need of mass transfer and the function of their exo-skeleton. Using the finite element method, the 3 D-modelled structures are compared re-garding their diffusion properties and the deflection at pressure load both among them-selves, and with the currently used SIS - membrane holders of sintered structures and steel springs. With respect {{to the design of}} an optimal sample inlet structure, the results show that the bionic structures allow a compromise between diffusion and deflection. Based on the re-sults the effects of different structural elements on the diffusion and the stiffness are dis-cussed. Both the design of the best possible pore size of the support structure for the mem-brane, and the integration of stiffening elements are of great importance for the structure of an innovative <b>membrane</b> <b>holder.</b> Finally a first approach to the development of an optimized <b>membrane</b> <b>holder</b> for sample inlet systems in the deep sea is presented...|$|E

One previously published method (McConville et al. 2000), the first to employ the use of an impactor/impinger, describes dispersing powder onto an air-liquid interface and evaluating drug dissolution into a specially designed dissolution reservoir. The apparatus comprised a modified twin stage liquid impinger with an enlarged Stage 1 base. Powder that was above the specified 4.7  μm particle cut-off impinged on an air-water interface, and dissolution of salbutamol from controlled release formulations was evaluated using a flow through detector. The method described was simply used for formulation comparison and was not designed to ‘mimic’ any conditions of the lung, and as described, the large particle sizes were only assessed leaving the < 4.7  μm fraction to be evaluated only as a fine particle mass. Salama et al. describe a similar method that makes use of a modified Franz diffusion apparatus incorporating a heated <b>membrane</b> <b>holder</b> at its surface and a heated dissolution reservoir containing phosphate buffered saline at pH  7.4. Drug formulations can be placed onto a membrane before inserting into the <b>membrane</b> <b>holder,</b> in this way an air-liquid interface is maintained as drug diffuses into the reservoir for analysis (Salama et al. 2008).|$|E

40|$|A {{limiting}} factor in {{electron beam lithography}} is the proximity effect. In the special case of X-ray mask making, Monte Carlo calculations and resist profile simulations show that the proximity effect can be almost entirely eliminated by using 100 keV electrons for the resist exposure. To verify the theoretical results of the simulation, experiments with available electron energies of 20 keV and 50 keV were conducted, with good agreement. The poor efficiency of 100 keV electrons results in decreasing resist sensitivity. Electrons passing through the <b>membrane</b> hit <b>holder</b> parts behind it.

40|$|Abstract: Heavy metal {{pollution}} {{is a serious}} problem that harms the environment and human health. As a means of removing heavy metal ions, especially Cr(VI), from a solution, we prepared a nanofibrous membrane from zein pro-tein which is derived from maize. The zein nanofibrous membrane (ZNM) was prepared by using an 80 % ethanol solu-tion as a solvent. The resulting fiber had a ribbon-like structure. The size of the nanofiber could be controlled by varying the concentration of the zein in the ethanol solution. The ZNM was mounted in a <b>membrane</b> <b>holder</b> and a Cr(VI) feed solution was then continuously passed through the ZNM. The adsorption of Cr(VI) reached equilibrium within 3 min, indicating the rapid adsorption of the Cr(VI). To regenerate the ZNM adsorbent, the adsorbed Cr(VI) was removed by adding 0. 1 M NaOH. We believe that ZNM would be an effective means of removing Cr(VI) from indus...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{reflector}} insert, {{the original}} HM- 3 lithotripter field at 20 kV was altered significantly with the peak positive pressure (p(+)) in the focal plane increased from 49 to 87 MPa while the - 6 dB focal width decreased concomitantly from 11 to 4 mm. Using the original reflector, p(+) of 33 MPa with a - 6 dB focal width of 18 mm were measured in a pre-focal plane 15 -mm proximal to the lithotripter focus. However, the acoustic pulse energy delivered to a 28 -mm diameter {{area around the}} lithotripter axis was comparable (approximately 120 mJ). For all three exposure conditions, similar stone comminution (approximately 70 %) was produced in a mesh holder of 15 mm after 250 shocks. In contrast, stone comminution produced by the modified reflector either in a 15 -mm finger cot (45 %) or in a 30 -mm <b>membrane</b> <b>holder</b> (14 %) was significantly reduced from the corresponding values (56 % and 26 %) produced by the original reflector (no statistically significant differences were observed between the focal and pre-focal planes).

Membranes were positioned on the quartz sample tray and secured by a polytetrafluoroethylene <b>membrane</b> <b>holder.</b> The system was purged with nitrogen gas and evacuated by vacuum to a base pressure of ~ 500 mTorr for 5  min to remove any volatilized degradation products and saturate the chamber with water vapor. For the hydrophilic treatments of PP membranes, H 2 O was introduced as a liquid via a gas tight syringe and evaporated at a rate controlled by {{the pressure of the}} system (~ 100 mTorr). For the hydrophobic treatments of PES and nylon membranes, process gas (CF 4) was introduced to the chamber at a rate of 10  psi through a three-way needle valve, process solvents (DCM, C 6 F 14) were introduced as a liquid via a gas tight syringe and evaporated at a rate controlled by the pressure of the system (~ 100 mTorr). Following equilibration of the plasma chamber, the glow discharge was initiated at 18  W for various treatment times (1 – 5  min).

40|$|Purpose Administration of aerosolised {{drugs to}} the lungs {{represents}} an effective route for local and systemic drug administration, with advantages such as large surface area, good permeability, optimum blood perfusion and avoidance {{of the first}} pass effect. However, the fate of an inhaled particle upon deposition remains unclear. Factors such as aerodynamic particles size, surface area of inhaled particulates and site of delivery may directly affect dissolution rates and thus pharmacological effects for dissolution limited drugs (Davies and Feddah, 2003). For solid oral dosage forms, pharmacopoeias describe standard tests for the dissolution of solid and semisolid formulations for in-vitro quality control, as well as comparisons between pharmaceutical dosage forms and predictive estimates of in-vivo behaviour. There is not, however, a standardized method for dissolution studies of inhaled products. Several previous {{studies have focused on}} dissolution for aerosols, but appear to be limited by experimental difficulties related to aerosol dose collection (Niemiec et al 2014; Son and McConville 2009). This study attempts to address these issues and understand the fate of inhaled particles within the respiratory tract. A specific dissolution test for aerosols, which integrates particles deposition and dissolution studies in sink conditions, was developed. In our study an in-vitro dissolution method that can be applied for discrimination as well as bio relevant studies and having a novel <b>membrane</b> <b>holder</b> was developed and validated for inhalation products. Methods From a Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) containing Fluticasone Propionate (FP) as active ingredient (Flixotide 250 ìg), aerosolized particles were collected on a glass fibre filter (i. e. GF/D 25 mm diameter Whatman®) using a NGI apparatus modified on stage 2 with a novel sample holder and vacuum pump set at 60 L/min for 4 s. This novel modification of the stage 2 allowed collection of particles under a uniform air stream, resulting in even distribution of aerosolised particles on the filters surface. Increased doses (1, 2, 5 and 10 doses) from DPI were loaded upon GF/D filters using the novel <b>membrane</b> <b>holder</b> on NGI stage 2. Each filter was then placed in a flow through cell and dissolution testing was performed with USP IV apparatus (Erweka DFZ 720) operating as an open system. During dissolution a constant flow of fresh solvent through the cells at a flow rate of 2 or 4 ml/min was set at 37 °C. The media used was phosphate buffer saline solution (Tomaszewska et al., 2013) with 0. 2 % w/w SLS. Samples were collected every 15 minutes for 240 minutes. After dissolution the total recovery was also measured by washing filters in defined quantities of mobile phase and sonicating. All quantification measurements were carried out by HPLC-UV (Agilent Technologies, 1200 Series). All experiments were run in triplicate. Results The flow through cell dissolution apparatus (USP IV) provides sink conditions, during the whole test period being particularly suitable for poorly soluble drugs such as FP. Powder dissolution profiles of Flixotide 250 ìg at 2 mL/min loaded with 1 dose released > 90 % within the first 60 minutes and reached 100 % release after 120 minutes. Whereas at the same flow rate (2 mL/min) samples loaded with higher doses (2, 5, 10 doses) showed a similar dissolution performance but slower compared to the performance of the lower dose under these conditions and the % dissolved reached > 90 % in 240 minutes of dissolution. This dissolution conditions used were able to estimate dissolution rates of this inhalation product and to provide discrimination between the different doses. Using a higher flow rate (4 mL/min) all samples (1, 2, 5 and 10 doses) reached 100 % dissolution after 60 minutes, with negligible differences between the loaded doses providing the biorelevance of the selected conditions. Conclusion A novel deposition model has been developed for the evaluation of in-vitro dissolution behaviour of an aerosol formulation and the dissolution performance of a commercial product with an open flow through cell system was successfully estimated. The method developed would be suitable for quality control studies of DPIs and for prediction of their in vivo performance...|$|E
40|$|Author: Sosnick Lab, University of Chicago ### Description For protein concentration, gas {{pressure}} is applied directly to ultrafiltration cell. Solutes above the membrane's molecular weight (MW) cut-off are retained in cell, while water and solutes below the cut-off {{pass into the}} filtrate and out of cell. ![Table]([URL] "`Table 1 ") ### Membranes 1. YM 10 Ø 43 mm (for 8050), Amicon # 13622, 10 pack: $ 108 - YM 10 Ø 76 mm (for 8400), Amicon # 13642, 10 pack: $ 139 - **Prewash**: float membrane with glossy side down in beaker with distilled water for at least 1 hour changing water 3 times. All membranes are pretreated with glycerine to prevent drying, YM membranes are treated with sodium azide as a preservative. - **Cleaning**: rinse with 0. 1 M NaOH, followed by thorough flushing with distilled water. For strongly absorbed protein, soak in 0. 1 % protease solution and rinse thoroughly. - **Storage**: for reuse, store membranes in 10 % ethanol water solution at 4 °C. ### Assembly 1. Place membrane in holder, **shiny side up**; then place O-ring on top of membrane. Gently push O-ring down so that it contacts and seats membrane evenly in bottom of holder. **Handle membrane by its edges to avoid scratching or contaminating surface**. - Fit <b>membrane</b> <b>holder</b> into cell body, aligning tabs on sides of holder with slots in base of cell body. - Invert cell body and membrane holder; screw base firmly into bottom of cell body. A definite "stop" will be felt when base and body are fully engaged. Top of <b>membrane</b> <b>holder</b> will be flush with bottom of slots in cell body. - Push filtrate exit tubing onto exit spout of membrane support. - Place stirrer assembly into cell body. When properly installed, arms of stirrer assembly will rest on small ridge inside top of cell body. - Introduce sample into cell. - With a twisting motion, push cap down onto cell body, orienting gas inlet port on cap opposite filtrate exit port on holder. If cap assembly does not slide easily, lubricate O-ring lightly with petroleum jelly. **Do not allow petroleum jelly to contact membrane!** - Set pressure-relief valve to horizontal (open) position. - Slide cell into retaining stand, fitting ring on cell base into hole in stand. Flattened edges on bottom flange of cap ensures that cell is inserted properly and prevents rotation of cell once inside stand. - Turn pressure-relief valve to vertical (closed) position. - Attach {{gas pressure}} line. ### Operation 1. Place cell on magnetic stirring table. - Connect inlet line to regulated gas pressure source (Nitrogen gas is recommended for pressurizing cell! Use of compressed air can cause large pH shifts due to dissolution of carbon dioxide. With sensitive solutions, oxidation can also occur, leading to other potential problems.) - Hold cell steady on the stirring table and pressurize according to instructions in membrane package. Generally ** 55 psi** (3. 7 kg/cm 2) is optimal, maximal 70 psi (4. 7 kg/cm 2) nitrogen gas pressure. Cap assembly moves upward, forming a secure lock with retaining stand once system is pressurized. - Turn on stirring table and adjust stirring rate until the vortex created is approximately one-third {{the depth of the}} liquid volume. - Monitor concentration. Do not allow retentate to run through. - Collect permeate. - Highly viscous solutions filter slowly, as do solutions containing particulate matter, such as colloids. Where the viscous agent (sucrose, glycerin, etc.) is to be removed, flow can often be increased by predilution. - **Prefilter or centrifuge** any solution containing particulate matter, such as cell debris or precipitates. - To maximize recovery of retained substances, continue stirring for a few minutes after depressurization. This will resuspend the polarized layer at the membrane surface. - When finished, turn off nitrogen pressure source and stirring table. - Vent pressure inside cell by slowly turning pressure-relief knob to horizontal position. Push cap down, then slide cell out from retaining stand. *Note: Overly rapid depressurization can cause the membrane to buckle up and rupture*. - Using a twisting motion, remove cell cap and the magnetic stirrer assembly. Always remove the cell top with the pressure-relief valve set to the horizontal (open) position. Removal in vertical (closed) position can create a partial vacuum which can rupture the membrane! Pour out solution. - Disassemble cell, then wash all components with a mild detergent/water solution, then rinse thoroughly. Caustic cleaning solutions may damage the anodized aluminum retaining stand. Leave ultrafiltration cell disassembled whenever it is unlikely to be used for several weeks. ### Limits - max. cell operating **pressure**: 75 psi (5. 3 kg/cm 2) - max. membrane operating pressure: 70 psi (4. 7 kg/cm 2) - pressure-relief valve preset: 90 psi (6. 3 kg/cm 2) - Although brief exposure to higher **temperatures** is possible, do not operate cell continuously above 85 °C (185 °F). - **pH** 2 to 10 - Do not use the following **chemicals**: Ketones (including acetone), Aromatic hydrocarbons (including toluene), Cellosolvers, Halogenated hydrocarbons, DMF, Aliphatic esters, DMSO, Polar Aromatics. *Note:The spring in the pressure-relief valve is not compatible with 0. 1 N NaOH*. ### Sterilization Amicon stirred ultrafiltration cells can be autoclaved at 121 °C (250 °F) for 30 minutes. They are compatible with standard sterilizing gas mixtures, 70 % ethanol, isopropanol or 5 % formalin. **CAUTION**: Tighten the base partially before autoclaving. ### Maintenance - Replace O-rings {{at the first sign of}} damage or wear. - If installation or removal of cap assembly becomes difficult, lubricate cap O-ring with a small amount of petroleum jelly. **Do not allow petroleum jelly to come in contact with membrane!** - Check stirrer periodically for rough edges that could possibly damage the membrane. - Replace transparent body immediately should it become cracked or crazed. ### Troubleshooting **Little or no filtrate obtained:** 1. Rotate pressure-relief valve to check for pressure. If not pressurized, check nitrogen source and regulator. - Make sure glossy side of disc membrane faces up. - If sample solution is highly viscous due to microsolutes, either dilute or diafilter to increase flow rate. - Check <b>membrane</b> <b>holder</b> and filtrate port for blockage. **Filtrate rate abnormally high:** 1. Check membrane for lesions, scratches, or roughness. - Make sure correct membrane type is being used. - Check stirrer assembly to ensure that stirring bar is not contacting the membrane surface. **Cell leaks:** 1. Be sure lower O-ring rests entirely on the membrane peripheral surface. - Check O-rings for nicks and cuts. - Make sure membrane support is seated properly, and that the base is screwed in firmly. - Make sure O-rings are not squeezed out of slots. - Check fittings on gas inlet tubing for correct order and position...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{formulation}} of the synthesis problem for reactive systems by Church in the 60 s, research on synthesis has lead to both theoretical insights and practical approaches for automatically constructing systems from their specifications. While the first solution {{of the problem was}} given by Büchi as early as 1969, only very recently, focus has shifted towards identifying ways to exploit the structure in reactive system specifications in order to lift the scalability of synthesis to industrial-sized designs. The recent progress in synthesis not only lead to a renewed interest in the subject, but also shed light onto the downsides of current synthesis approaches. In the original formulation of the problem, the structure of the produced solutions was not a concern. Experiments with current synthesis approaches has however shown that the computed implementations are usually very hard to understand and have little of the structure that manually constructed implementations have. Furthermore, the scalability of current synthesis approaches is still deemed to be insufficient for many industrial application scenarios, which prevents the introduction of reactive synthesis technology into industrial design flows. In this thesis, we tackle both of these problems for reactive synthesis. To counter the insufficient structure in the solutions, we analyse the problem of symmetric synthesis. In this alternative synthesis problem, the aim is to compute a solution that consists of multiple copies of the same process such that the overall system satisfies the specification. Such systems have no centralised control units, and are considered to be more robust and easier to maintain. We characterise undecidable and decidable cases of the problem, and provide a synthesis algorithm for rotation-symmetric architectures, which capture many cases of practical relevance. To improve the scalability in synthesis, we start with a simple but scalable approach to reactive synthesis that has shown its principal applicability in the field, and extend its main idea both in terms of scope and usability. We enhance its expressivity in a way that allows to synthesise robust systems, and remove its limitation to specifications of a very special form. Both improvements yield theoretical insights into the synthesis problem: we characterise which specification classes can be supported in synthesis approaches that use parity games with a fixed number of colours as the underlying computation model, and examine the properties of universal very-weak automata, on which we base a synthesis workflow that combines ease of specification with a low complexity of the underlying game solving step. As a side-result, we also obtain the first procedure to translate a formula in linear-time temporal logic (LTL) to a computation tree logic (CTL) formula with only universal path quantifiers, whenever possible. The new results on symmetric and efficient reactive synthesis are complemented by an easily accessible introductory chapter to the field of reactive synthesis that can also be read in isolation. paddle apparatus with <b>membrane</b> <b>holder</b> were identified. Trotz der Vorzüge der Synthese reaktiver Systeme gegenüber der manuellen Konstruktion solcher Systeme ist Synthese noch nicht als Teil industrieller Vorgehensmodelle etabliert. Als Hauptgrund für diese Diskrepanz gilt allgemein, dass sowohl die Qualität der synthetisierten Systeme bei Anwendung bisheriger Methoden unzureichend ist, als auch die Skalierbarkeit aktueller Syntheseverfahren der Verbesserung bedarf. Diese Dissertation behandelt beide diese Probleme der Synthese reaktiver Systeme auf breiter Front. Zur Verbesserung der Qualität synthetisierter Systeme wird die Synthese von strukturierten Systemen betrachtet. Experimente mit aktuellen Syntheseverfahren haben gezeigt, dass die erzeugten Implementierungen oft schwer zu verstehen sind und anders als handgeschriebene Implementierungen kaum Struktur haben. Abhilfe verschafft die Beschränkung auf die Erzeugung symmetrischer Systeme, die aus mehreren Kopien des selben Prozesses bestehen, so dass das Gesamtsystem die Spezifikation erfüllt. Solche Systeme haben keine zentrale Koordinationskomponente und werden allgemein als robuster und einfacher zu warten eingestuft. In dieser Dissertation werden entscheidbare und unentscheidbare Fälle des symmetrischen Syntheseproblems identifiziert und ein Synthesealgorithmus für rotationssymmetrische Systeme beschrieben. Diese Systemklasse deckt viele praktisch relevante Architekturen ab. Um das Problem der mangelnden Skalierbarkeit anzugehen, wird die Hauptidee des Generalised Reactivity(1) Syntheseansatzes, welcher seine praktische Anwendbarkeit bereits unter Beweis gestellt hat, aufgegriffen und sowohl bezüglich der Expressivität als auch der Benutzbarkeit vervollständigt. Die Erweiterung der Expressivität ermöglicht es, den resultierenden Ansatz für die Synthese robuster Systeme zu nutzen, während die Benutzbarkeit für industrielle Anwendungen durch die Aufhebung der Beschränkung, dass die Spezifikation eine sehr spezielle Form haben muss, erreicht wird. Beide Erweiterungen geben Einsicht in die Theorie der Synthese: Zum einen wird die Klasse der Spezifikationen, die in Syntheseansätzen verwendet werden können, die auf dem Lösen von Paritätsspielen mit einer vordefinierten Anzahl von Farben basieren, charakterisiert. Zum anderen wird Einsicht in die Eigenschaften universeller sehr schwacher Automaten gegeben. Ein Nebenprodukt der neuen Syntheseverfahren ist die erste Prozedur, um einen Ausdruck in linear-time temporal logic (LTL) in computation tree logic mit universellen Pfadquantoren (ACTL) zu übersetzen, wann immer dies möglich ist. Die Resultate zur symmetrischen und effizienten reaktiven Synthese werden von einer didaktisch aufbereiteten Einführung in das Gebiet der reaktiven Synthese begleitet, welche auch unabhängig von den übrigen Teilen der Dissertation gelesen werden kann...|$|E
40|$|Driven by {{miniaturization}} and {{the continuing}} increase in clock speed and data transfer, power dissipation in many electronic components has exceeded the limits of conventional cooling methodologies, such as fan-blown air cooling. Given the expected increase in power density, microprocessor designers have identified cooling {{as one of the}} major challenges for the next decade. Similar needs arise from the further development of other electronic devices such as Light Emitting Diodes (LED), where future generations of high light-output multichip LED modules are being developed for general and automotive illumination applications as well as for power electronics. Hence, there is a tremendous need for innovative cooling technologies. One of the most important factors in reducing the lifetime of micro-electronic components is the high operation temperature and thermal cycling. Liquid cooling has been identified {{as one of the most}} promising solutions in reducing the operation temperature of high power electronics. Liquid cooling is often not optimized, leading to excess of cooling and large temperature variations over the IC. If the coolant is allowed to boil in the cooling channels, the heat transfer coefficient is increased with one order of magnitude. The problem of phase transition regime is the boiling instability. A solution of these problems is addressed by implementation of valves in the cooling system. For single-phase systems they have the role of maintaining a more uniform temperature over the IC and to reduce the pumping power. For two-phase systems the valve purpose is to maintain the most optimum boiling conditions. A comparative study of different actuation principles was performed to identify the best actuation technology applied for chip cooling valves which meet the cooling requirements targeted in this PhD project. This classifies the valve size between the micro and macro-scale, a field which has been mainly overlooked by prior research and potentially promising applications have not been yet explored. It is for the first time that valves are especially designed for chip cooling applications. The principal requirements for the mechanical valves are the following: no leakage to the environment, low power consumption, continuous and proportional flow control, low cost, fast response time, small size and high reliability. The most promising actuation technology found for single-phase flow is thermopneumatic actuation. Based on this principle, a valve has been designed manufactured and tested on a cooling system. The valve actuation is performed by the thermal expansion of a liquid (actuation fluid) which, at the same time, actuates the valve and provides feed-back sensing. The thermopneumatic valve shows a novel actuation principle that combines the advantages of zero power consumption, small size compared with the high flow rate, and low manufacturing costs. This valve has the major advantage that it can be used together with any heat sink used for microelectronic cooling. Its small size and its independence from external energy make it suited for portable devices. No electrical connection, no wires and no electronic control are needed, increasing its simplicity and reliability. A maximum flow rate of 38 kg/h passes through the valve for a heat load up to 133 W. The valve is able to reduce the pumping power by up to 60 % and has the capability to reduce the temperature variation over the IC with up to 24 %. The most suitable actuation principle found for two-phase cooling is electro- magnetic actuation for large bandwidth, large forces, relatively high strokes and low manufacturing cost. The electromagnetic valve uses the reluctance actuation principle. It makes use of a pilot valve to reduce the size and the required actuation force. The emphasis is placed on a compact planar design to fit in planar devices. A pressure balance design allows operation at high system pressures. Because the pressure balance is used to drive the valve, an analytical and numerical model has been developed to predict the pressure distribution over the valve. The pilot valve has also been modelled as well and linearised using the results obtained from the model. The results of the model have been successfully validated by measurements. The valve is capable to control a flow rate up to 15 kg/h. This flow rate is sufficient to remove a heat input of 133 W equivalent with a heat flux of 500 W/cm 2 at a temperature difference of 20 deg. C. Its equilibrated design allows a pressure drop control of up to 100 kPa at maximum system pressures of 600 kPa. Compared with the latest research published in literature and the latest developments in industry, this electromagnetic valve classifies on top of the list when it comes to the following combined properties in a single package: high speed proportional control, compact dimensions, high flow rates at low pressure drop, high reliability and low manufacturing cost. This research demonstrates the need for valves and the benefits of using valves in high performance cooling systems.
