5|$|The Ottomans did {{not keep}} <b>Macedonia</b> as an {{administrative}} unit: since 1864 parts of geographical <b>Macedonia</b> lay in three vilayets, which also comprised some non-Macedonian areas.

5000|$|Several {{scholars}} see VMRO-DPMNE’s {{promotion of}} so-called antiquization {{as a reaction}} to the stagnation of <b>Macedonia’s</b> foreign affairs due to Greeks opposition to <b>Macedonia’s</b> efforts for EU- and NATO-membership. According to this view, Gruevski’s government thus prioritized its consolidation of power on the national level as well as it aims at fostering <b>Macedonia’s</b> nation building process. Christopher Flood describes these kinds of processes in a more general manner. Therefore, political myths and grand narratives, as for example ancient Macedonian nationhood, come up as a consequence of a situation in which a society experienced some kind of trauma. Others point out that the glory of a national hero like Alexander the Great helps to overcome what has been called the ‘moral crisis of post-communism’: the situation of a country that still has to handle the burden of a complex and tiresome post-communist transition, smoldering ethnicized tensions, a weak economy and low living standards. Vangeli, therefore, summarizes that “antiquity-inspired Macedonian nationalist rhetoric has emerged as a ‘compensation for backwardness’ (Hanák) brought by the unsuccessful regime change and the incomplete consolidation of the new regime". However, as outlined above, Greece’s opposition is also motivated by <b>Macedonia’s</b> recollection of its alleged ancient history and descent. Both countries thus enter a vicious circle if one follows the argumentation that Greece’s opposition was due to <b>Macedonia’s</b> antiquization and <b>Macedonia’s</b> antiquization was due to Greece’s opposition.|$|R
5|$|Although {{perhaps not}} as {{prolific}} as {{other areas of}} Greece in regards to technological innovations, there are some inventions that may have originated in <b>Macedonia</b> aside from siege engines and artillery. The rotary-operated olive press for producing olive oil may have been invented in ancient <b>Macedonia</b> or another part of Greece, or even as far east as the Levant or Anatolia. Mold-pressed glass first appeared in <b>Macedonia</b> in the 4thcenturyBC (although it could have simultaneously existed in the Achaemenid Empire); the first known clear, translucent glass pieces of the Greek world have been discovered in <b>Macedonia</b> and Rhodes and date to {{the second half of}} the 4thcenturyBC. Greek technical and scientific literature began with Classical Athens in the 5thcenturyBC, while the major production centers for technical innovation and texts during the Hellenistic period were Alexandria, Rhodes, and Pergamon.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there are}} no other large cities in the Republic of <b>Macedonia,</b> and because of {{political}} and economical centralisation, a large number of Macedonians living outside of Skopje work in the capital city. The dynamism of the city also encourages rural exodus, not only from <b>Macedonia,</b> but also from Kosovo, Albania and Southern Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Greece and the Republic of <b>Macedonia</b> each {{consider}} this name a compromise: it is opposed by some Greeks for containing the Greek self-identifying name <b>Macedonia,</b> and {{by many in}} the Republic of <b>Macedonia</b> for not being the short self-identifying name.

50|$|The fact {{of being}} {{excluded}} from these organizations despite the investments and reforms {{that had been}} undertaken, ultimately revitalized the uncertainty concerning the country’s economic and security perspectives. This has strengthened the “defeatist attitude”, that, irrespective of {{the efforts of the}} Macedonian government, Greece and other opponents would always find a possibility to block <b>Macedonia’s</b> progress. “The main engine driving nation-state building has not been Albanian-Macedonian relations, but rather the tensions with Greece over <b>Macedonia’s</b> name, particularly acute since the Greek veto to <b>Macedonia’s</b> NATO membership in 2008. The widely pursued antiquization campaign, including the megalomanic project Skopje 2014, have emphasized promoting one ethnic defined identity”.|$|R
5|$|The Macedonians {{successfully}} defended {{their territory}} for roughly two years, but the Roman consul Titus Quinctius Flamininus managed to expel PhilipV from <b>Macedonia</b> in 198BC, forcing {{his men to}} take refuge in Thessaly. When the Achaean League switched their loyalties from <b>Macedonia</b> to Rome, the Macedonian king sued for peace, but the terms offered were considered too stringent, and so the war continued. In June 197BC, the Macedonians were defeated at the Battle of Cynoscephalae. Rome then ratified a treaty that forced <b>Macedonia</b> to relinquish control of much of its Greek possessions outside of <b>Macedonia</b> proper, if only {{to act as a}} buffer against Illyrian and Thracian incursions into Greece. Although some Greeks suspected Roman intentions of supplanting <b>Macedonia</b> as the new hegemonic power in Greece, Flaminius announced at the Isthmian Games of 196BC that Rome intended to preserve Greek liberty by leaving behind no garrisons and by not exacting tribute of any kind. His promise was delayed by negotiations with the Spartan king Nabis, who had meanwhile captured Argos, yet Roman forces evacuated Greece in 194BC.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Romans had two {{different}} entities called <b>Macedonia,</b> at different levels. <b>Macedonia</b> was {{established as a}} Roman province in 146BC.
