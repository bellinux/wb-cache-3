5|$|The trial opens as {{originally}} scheduled, {{but the two}} Finley & Figg partners prove unequal to the task. During opening statements, Oscar suffers a myocardial infarction. Wally attempts to <b>make</b> <b>light</b> of the situation by proclaiming it an example of Krayoxx's side effects. Karros moves for a mistrial and the motion is granted, leading {{to the need to}} pick a new jury and the judge imposes a fine on the already financially strained Finley & Figg. Wally stands in for Oscar as lead attorney while a new jury is seated and for the first day of testimony. The next day, the recovering alcoholic Figg is nowhere to be found although an empty pint bottle of Smirnoff Vodka is.|$|E
5|$|Piquet {{clinched}} the first pole position {{of his career}} and the maiden first position start for his team NextEV {{with a time of}} one minute and 3.099 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by teammate Turvey who was 0.132 seconds slower than Piquet's time. In his first Formula E qualifying session, López qualified third in front of his teammate Bird. Buemi went out first in the fourth group and was initially two-tenths of a second slower than Piquet despite not running wide or making contact with the barriers on his full power lap and took fifth place. Rosenqvist was the first driver to go onto the track in the group three and drove aggressively which saw him <b>make</b> <b>light</b> contact with the barrier to qualify sixth. Abt took seventh place, ahead of Duval but he served a three-place starting position penalty after he was observed speeding under red-flag conditions in the shakedown session. As a result, Vergne inherited the position and his fastest time was achieved on cold tyres and brakes. Prost's full power lap saw him narrowly avoid impacting the chicane and his car slid at the final turn which restricted him to starting ninth. Heidfeld rounded out the top-ten qualifiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{final version}} of Valve's high-dynamic-range {{technology}} adds {{a significant number of}} lighting effects to the engine, aimed at making the game appear more realistic. Bloom shading was introduced, blurring bright edges in the game world and emulating a camera's overexposure to light. This is combined with exposure control to tailor the effect to represent the human eye. For example, as the player exits a dark area into a light area, the new area is initially glaringly bright, but quickly darkens, representing the adjustment of the player character's eyes to the light. New cube mapping techniques allow the reflection cast by an object to correspond with the brightness of the light source, and lightmaps enable light bouncing and global illumination {{to be taken into account}} in the rendering. Refraction effects were added to <b>make</b> <b>light</b> account for the physical attributes of an object and to emulate the way light is reflected by water. The Lost Coast level is specifically designed to showcase these effects. It uses the sea and beach as opportunities to demonstrate water-based effects, the monastery to demonstrate bloom from its whitewash walls, and the sanctuary to provide the means to show refraction through stained glass windows and cube maps on golden urns and candlesticks.|$|E

5|$|This {{game was}} {{designed}} at Nintendo's Research and Development 1 (R) division, while the programming was {{handled by the}} external company Intelligent Systems (known as Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena at the time). The game was developed for the Family Computer Disk System (FDS) because the peripheral's Disk Card media allowed for three times the storage capacity of the Family Computer's (and NES's) console's cartridges. Combined with the possibility to store the players' progress, the floppy disk format enabled the developers to create a longer game with a more extensive game world. Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena was Toru Osawa's debut as a video game designer, {{and he was the}} only staff member working on the game {{at the beginning of the}} project. Osawa (credited in the U.S. version as Inusawa) intended to <b>make</b> <b>Light</b> Myth: Palutena's Mirror an action game with role-playing elements, and wrote a story rooted in Greek mythology, which he had always been fond of. He drew the pixel art, and wrote the technical specifications, which were the basis for the playable prototype that was programmed by Intelligent Systems. After Nintendo's action-adventure Metroid had been finished, more staff members were allotted to the development of Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena.|$|E
5|$|Jim's plan {{to drive}} home from Philadelphia to see his {{daughter}} CeCe's ballet recital hits a snag when a major investor says he is backing out. Jim asks his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to record the recital with her phone, which she agrees to do. During {{the opening of the}} recital, she stops recording to take a phone call informing her that she has been chosen to paint an important public mural. In her excitement, she messes up the recording and fails to record any of CeCe's appearance. Jim calls her that evening to tell her the investor backed out, and his group will have to work long hours to make up the lost funds. He asks her to send him her recording of the recital as a way to cheer him up, and Pam confesses that she did not tape it. She tries to <b>make</b> <b>light</b> of the mishap by making self-deprecating remarks and pointing out that they can get recordings of the recital from other attendees, but he becomes frustrated at her, scolding her and starting a fight over his new job, the time he spends away from the family, and the sacrifices they are making to get their new life to work. After he hangs up, Pam breaks down in tears. A previously unseen boom operator named Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) enters into the shot and comforts her, and tells the crew to stop filming.|$|E

25|$|David Bevington {{argues that}} the play {{represents}} {{the dark side of}} love. He writes that the fairies <b>make</b> <b>light</b> of love by mistaking the lovers and by applying a love potion to Titania's eyes, forcing her {{to fall in love with}} an ass. In the forest, both couples are beset by problems. Hermia and Lysander are both met by Puck, who provides some comic relief in the play by confounding the four lovers in the forest. However, the play also alludes to serious themes. At the end of the play, Hippolyta and Theseus, happily married, watch the play about the unfortunate lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe, and are able to enjoy and laugh at it. Helena and Demetrius are both oblivious to the dark side of their love, totally unaware of what may have come of the events in the forest.|$|E

500|$|Theme Hospital was {{released}} in March 1997 (although it was originally due for release in November 1996), and is part of Bullfrog's Designer Series. The game attracted some controversy from NHS managers, the Houses of Parliament, and The Daily Telegraph, who published an article criticising the game as [...] "sick" [...] because the British Medical Association was using it to train management staff. The NHS argued that the game mocked hospital management. Webley was invited to appear on a local radio station; he did not consider the game to <b>make</b> <b>light</b> of real-world health management because it featured fictional diseases rather than real ones. Theme Hospital was a commercial success, which surprised Bullfrog and Electronic Arts. It repeatedly appeared {{in the top five}} of budget charts and sold over 4 million copies. In 2014, Molyneux stated that he wanted the game to make a comeback, and described Theme Hospital as [...] "a great game that I and many people remember".|$|E
500|$|Originally, Hollis {{hoped that}} the {{difference}} between light and dark would be a significant feature of the gameplay, and the title was intended to reflect this focus. A flashlight was implemented by Steve Ellis, who had been responsible for much of the multiplayer mode of GoldenEye 007, but it {{was not included in the}} final game due to the limitations of the Nintendo 64 hardware. Hollis remarked that such aims were overambitious, commenting in 2006 that [...] "Even today, you can see game developers struggle to <b>make</b> <b>light</b> and dark foundational from a gameplay perspective. I suspect it will take a few years before significant and pervasive gameplay innovation occurs here." [...] Although not all these intended features were realised, the game contains more advanced lighting than its predecessor. For example, lights can be shot out to create darkened areas, gunfire and explosions illuminate rooms dynamically, and the player can use infrared and night vision goggles.|$|E

The lungs stretch from close to the backbone in the rib cage to the front of the chest and downwards from the lower part of the trachea to the diaphragm.
