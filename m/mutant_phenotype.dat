25|$|The {{hedgehog}} gene (hh) was first {{identified in the}} fruit-fly Drosophila melanogaster in the classic Heidelberg screens of Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus, as published in 1980. These screens, which led to them winning the Nobel Prize in 1995 along with developmental geneticist Edward B. Lewis, identified genes that control the segmentation pattern of the Drosophila embryos. The hh loss of function <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotype</b> causes the embryos to be covered with denticles, small pointy projections resembling the spines of a hedgehog.|$|E
500|$|MRNA rescue {{experiments}} {{can often}} restore the wild-type phenotype to the embryos and {{provide evidence for}} the specificity of a Morpholino. In an mRNA rescue, a Morpholino is co-injected with an mRNA that codes for the morphlino's [...] protein. However, the rescue mRNA has a modified 5'-UTR (untranslated region) so that the rescue mRNA contains no target for the Morpholino. The rescue mRNA's coding region encodes the protein of interest. Translation of the rescue mRNA replaces production of the protein that was knocked down by the Morpholino. Since the rescue mRNA would not affect phenotypic changes due to the Morpholino's off-target gene expression modulation, this return to wild-type phenotype is further evidence of Morpholino specificity. [...] In embryos, Morpholinos can be tested in null mutants to check for unexpected RNA interactions, then used in a wild-type embryo to reveal the acute knockdown phenotype (often more extreme than the <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotype,</b> in which effects of losing the null gene can be concealed by genetic compensation).|$|E
2500|$|A white-eyed [...] "albino" [...] {{horn fly}} was {{discovered}} in a colony maintained at the Knipling-Bushland U.S. Livestock Insects Research Laboratory in Kerrville, Texas. This is apparently a spontaneous mutation, as tests including crosses were performed that determined the white-eye mutation was not sex-linked and the white-eyed flies actually have decreased amounts of eye pigment present within the head. This {{appears to be an}} inherited simple Mendelian autosomal recessive with complete penetrance. A colony of white-eyed horn flies was established from this single individual and has been maintained in the laboratory as visible genetic markers such as an eye color mutation in an economically important species like the horn fly may be useful for behavior and population dynamic studies, as well as release and recapture studies. No other differences from the wild-type flies were detected in the external characteristics of the <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotype</b> or in egg viability. However, white-eyed flies had significantly lower amounts of the pigment dihydroxyxanthommatin in their heads suggesting either the lack of xanthommatin production, or a failure of transport and storage within the head of the <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotype.</b>|$|E
40|$|Certain {{classes of}} pyocyanine mutants in Pseudomonas aeruginosa escape {{detection}} when screened {{in the presence}} of wild-type or other mutant cells. A technique is described for recognizing <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes</b> after cells are in individual agar wells. The procedure eliminates cross-feeding phenomena as well as the masking of <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes</b> by diffusing pyocyanine produced by nearby clones...|$|R
40|$|The Notch gene is {{a member}} of one of the sets of genes that control the {{developmental}} pathways that specify cell fate decisions in Drosophila melanogaster. The goal of this research was to use a genetic approach to identify and characterize a gene that functions with Notch in a cell fate pathway. A candidate was found in a new mutation that causes phenotypes similar to Notch and that interacts phenotypically with Notch mutations. This mutation was identified as a mutation of the deltex gene. The deltex gene was mapped to the salivary chromosome band region 6 AB. <b>Mutant</b> <b>phenotypes</b> in the wings, legs, eyes, ocelli, and bristles were demonstrated. The <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes</b> of deltex are consistent with the hypothesis that deltex functions in a cell fate pathway. A comparison of deltex <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes</b> with Notch <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes</b> showed that the phenotypes are very similar. Synergistic phenotypic interactions between mutations of deltex and mutations of Notch showed that deltex and Notch function together in the wings, legs, eyes, ocelli, and bristles. The results of these investigations lead {{to the conclusion that the}} deltex gene functions with the Notch gene in one or more developmental pathways to specify individual cell fate...|$|R
50|$|Additionally, many TEs contain {{promoters}} which drive transcription {{of their}} own transposase. These promoters can cause aberrant expression of linked genes, causing disease or <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Reciprocal sign {{epistasis}} {{also leads}} to genetic suppression whereby two deleterious mutations are less harmful together than either one on its own, i.e. one compensates for the other. This term can also apply sign epistasis where the double mutant has a phenotype intermediate between {{those of the}} single mutants, {{in which case the}} more severe single <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotype</b> is suppressed by the other mutation or genetic condition. [...] For example, in a diploid organism, a hypomorphic (or partial loss-of-function) <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotype</b> can be suppressed by knocking out one copy of a gene that acts oppositely in the same pathway. [...] In this case, the second gene is described as a [...] "dominant suppressor" [...] of the hypomorphic mutant; [...] "dominant" [...] because the effect is seen when one wild-type copy of the suppressor gene is present (i.e. even in a heterozygote). [...] For most genes, the phenotype of the heterozygous suppressor mutation by itself would be wild type (because most genes are not haplo-insufficient), so that the double mutant (suppressed) phenotype is intermediate between those of the single mutants.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{there is}} no direct {{evidence}} of a SHH gradient, there is indirect evidence via the visualization of Patched (Ptc) gene expression, which encodes for the ligand binding domain of the SHH receptor throughout the ventral neural tube. In vitro studies show that incremental two- and threefold changes in SHH concentration give rise to motor neuron and different interneuronal subtypes as found in the ventral spinal cord. These incremental changes in vitro correspond to the distance of domains from the signaling tissue (notochord and floor plate) which subsequently differentiates into different neuronal subtypes as it occurs in vitro. Graded SHH signaling is suggested to be mediated through the Gli family of proteins which are vertebrate homologues of the Drosophila zinc-finger-containing transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci) [...] Ci is a crucial mediator of hedgehog (Hh) signaling in Drosophila. In vertebrates three different Gli proteins are present, viz. Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3, which are expressed in the neural tube. Mice mutant for Gli1 show normal spinal cord development, suggesting that it is dispensable for mediating SHH activity. However Gli2 mutant mice show abnormalities in the ventral spinal cord with severe defects in the floor plate and ventral-most interneurons (V3). Gli3 antagonizes SHH function in a dose dependent manner, promoting dorsal neuronal subtypes. SHH <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotype</b> can be rescued in SHH/Gli3 double mutant. Gli proteins have a C-terminal activation domain and an N-terminal repressive domain.|$|E
2500|$|Conditional {{mutation}} is a mutation {{that has}} wild-type (or less severe) phenotype under certain [...] "permissive" [...] environmental conditions and a <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotype</b> under certain [...] "restrictive" [...] conditions. For example, a temperature-sensitive mutation can cause cell death at high temperature (restrictive condition), but might have no deleterious consequences {{at a lower}} temperature (permissive condition). These mutations are non-autonomous, as their manifestation depends upon presence of certain conditions, as opposed to other mutations which appear autonomously. The permissive conditions may be temperature, certain chemicals, light or mutations {{in other parts of}} the genome. In vivo mechanisms like transcriptional switches can create conditional mutations. For instance, association of Steroid Binding Domain can create a transcriptional switch that can change the expression of a gene based on the presence of a steroid ligand. Conditional mutations have applications in research as they allow control over gene expression. This is especially useful studying diseases in adults by allowing expression after a certain period of growth, thus eliminating the deleterious effect of gene expression seen during stages of development in model organisms. DNA Recombinase systems like Cre-Lox Recombination used in association with promoters that are activated under certain conditions can generate conditional mutations. Dual Recombinase technology can be used to induce multiple conditional mutations to study the diseases which manifest as a result of simultaneous mutations in multiple genes. Certain inteins have been identified which splice only at certain permissive temperatures, leading to improper protein synthesis and thus, loss of function mutations at other temperatures. Conditional mutations may also be used in genetic studies associated with ageing, as the expression can be changed after a certain time period in the organism's lifespan.|$|E
40|$|SummaryMany {{mutations}} cause genetic disorders. However, {{two people}} inheriting the same mutation often have different severity of symptoms, {{and this is}} partly genetic. The effects of genetic background on <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes</b> are poorly understood, but predicting them is critical for personalized medicine. To study this phenomenon comprehensively and systematically, we used RNAi to compare loss-of-function phenotypes for ∼ 1, 400 genes in two isolates of C.  elegans and find that ∼ 20 % of genes differ in the severity of phenotypes in these two genetic backgrounds. Crucially, this effect of genetic background on the severity of both RNAi and <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes</b> can be predicted from variation in the expression levels of the affected gene. This is also true in mammalian cells, suggesting it is a general property of genetic networks. We suggest that differences in the manifestation of <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes</b> between individuals are largely the result of natural variation in gene expression...|$|R
40|$|Truncating {{mutations}} in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) are strongly linked to colorectal cancers. APC {{is a negative}} regulator of the Wnt pathway and constitutive Wnt activation mediated by enhanced Wnt–β-catenin target gene activation {{is believed to be}} the predominant mechanism responsible for APC <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes.</b> However, recent evidence suggests that additional downstream effectors contribute to APC <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes.</b> We previously identified a mechanism in cultured human cells by which APC, acting through glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK- 3), suppresses mTORC 1, a nutrient sensor that regulates cell growth and proliferation. We hypothesized that truncating Apc mutations should activate mTORC 1 in vivo and that mTORC 1 plays an important role in Apc <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes.</b> We find that mTORC 1 is strongly activated in apc mutant zebrafish and in intestinal polyps in Apc mutant mice. Furthermore, mTORC 1 activation is essential downstream of APC as mTORC 1 inhibition partially rescues Apc <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes</b> including early lethality, reduced circulation and liver hyperplasia. Importantly, combining mTORC 1 and Wnt inhibition rescues defects in morphogenesis of the anterior-posterior axis that are not rescued by inhibition of either pathway alone. These data establish mTORC 1 as a crucial, β-catenin independent effector of oncogenic Apc mutations and highlight the importance of mTORC 1 regulation by APC during embryonic development. Our findings also suggest a new model of colorectal cancer pathogenesis in which mTORC 1 is activated in parallel with Wnt/β-catenin signaling...|$|R
40|$|SummaryMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that {{regulate}} the translation and/or stability of their mRNA targets. Previous work showed {{that for most}} miRNA genes of C. elegans, single-gene knockouts {{did not result in}} detectable <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes</b> [1]. This may be due, in part, to functional redundancy between miRNAs. However, in most cases, worms carrying deletions of all members of a miRNA family do not display strong <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes</b> [2]. They may function together with unrelated miRNAs or with non-miRNA genes in regulatory networks, possibly to ensure the robustness of developmental mechanisms. To test this, we examined worms lacking individual miRNAs in genetically sensitized backgrounds. These include genetic backgrounds with reduced processing and activity of all miRNAs or with reduced activity of a wide array of regulatory pathways [3]. With these two approaches, we identified <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes</b> for 25 out of 31 miRNAs included in this analysis. Our findings describe biological roles for individual miRNAs and suggest that the use of sensitized genetic backgrounds provides an efficient approach for miRNA functional analysis...|$|R

50|$|Alternatively it is {{possible}} to overexpress mutant forms of a gene that interfere with the normal (wildtype) gene's function.

The epaxial/hypaxial terminology is also used to describe regions of the embryonic somites based on fate mapping of somitic derivatives. However, the adult, functional distinctions are not fully consistent with the changing embryonic environments of mesodermal populations during morphogenesis, and the traditional terminology loses accuracy when used to describe certain <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes.</b> Here we describe a new terminology naming two mesodermal environments defined by the lineage of the included cells.

40|$|AbstractPresenilins are {{components}} of the γ-secretase protein complex that mediates intramembranous cleavage of βAPP and Notch proteins. A C. elegans genetic screen revealed two genes, aph- 1 and pen- 2, encoding multipass transmembrane proteins, that interact strongly with sel- 12 /presenilin and aph- 2 /nicastrin. Human aph- 1 and pen- 2 partially rescue the C. elegans <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes,</b> demonstrating conserved functions. The human genes must be provided together to rescue the <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes,</b> and the inclusion of presenilin- 1 improves rescue, suggesting that they interact closely {{with each other and}} with presenilin. RNAi-mediated inactivation of aph- 1, pen- 2, or nicastrin in cultured Drosophila cells reduces γ-secretase cleavage of βAPP and Notch substrates and reduces the levels of processed presenilin. aph- 1 and pen- 2, like nicastrin, are required for the activity and accumulation of γ-secretase...|$|R

Our results show that two unusual conditional <b>mutant</b> <b>phenotypes</b> can result from Tn 5 tac 1 insertion in Escherichia coli: one is corrected by IPTG while the other is induced by IPTG.
