25|$|To have {{declined}} the contest, and retired {{so as to}} effect a junction with his IV Corps, he must still, if he wished to act in close concert with Wellington, have abandoned his direct communication with the Meuse and the Rhine, whence he drew all his supplies; a result which <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> trusted to {{the chances of a}} battle.|$|E
25|$|Peter Hays {{has refused}} to give his lawyer any {{information}} on his background, something that counted against him with the district attorney, and seems depressed {{to the point of}} hopelessness, using the novel's title <b>Might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> dead to describe how he feels. This tends to validate Archie's tentative identification, but a personal meeting of Archie with Hays would be needed to be sure.|$|E

The statement was greeted with derision by the Opposition, with Fine Gael claiming it was motivated by the Progressive Democrats determination to keep Fianna Fáil in power. Labour Party leader Pat Rabbitte said the Progressive Democrats were now handcuffed to Fianna Fáil for the duration of this Dáil, and that there <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> single-party Government.|$|E
25|$|During {{his review}} of Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, Kermode made a passing comment {{that it was so}} similar to the Harry Potter {{franchise}} it <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> called 'Benjamin Sniddlegrass and the Cauldron of Penguins'. Listener Jeremy Dylan then took this title and produced posters, a trailer and, eventually, an independent film based on the concept, with Stephen Fry as narrator. Following the basic structure of the Harry Potter books, where the main character discovers special abilities and goes to a special school, the script contains a multitude of references to Wittertainment jokes and themes.|$|E
25|$|The modern Strait of Sicily {{separates}} Tunisia and Sicily by 145km, but is {{shallow and}} would have been much narrower in glacial maxima. We have a poor understanding of plate tectonics of this area for the greater part of the Pleistocene. But while plate tectonics could have made the strait narrower than predicted by the lowering of sea levels alone, contrast of Pleistocene fauna strongly argues against an actual land bridge. Since the strait is only 400km away from the North African hominin site of Ain Hanech in Algeria (1.8 Ma or 1.2 Ma) it remains a plausible route for Early Pleistocene expansion into Eurasia. But there is close to no evidence for a hominin passage. Alimen based most of her argument in favour of such a migration on Bianchini's discovery of Sicilian Oldowan grade tools. Radiometric dates, however, have not been produced, and the artefacts <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> from the Middle Pleistocene.|$|E

Phillips also bought some DVDs he thought might be useful, but never found time to watch them.|$|E
