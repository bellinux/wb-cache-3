On the other hand, cells inactivated by <b>propylene</b> <b>oxide</b> production rates in excess of 150 nmol min- 1 [mg dry weight]- 1 did not begin to recover activity within the 30 min period. Furthermore a lag period was observed before reactivation began which was dependent upon the initial production rate.

Production rates of 12 g l- 1 d- 1 could be maintained for longer than three weeks in a single phase production process and rates up to 30 g l- 1 d- 1 were achieved in a two stage process.

40|$|Evidence for a {{requirement}} for CO 2 in the productive metabolism of aliphatic alkenes and epoxides by the propylene-oxidizing bacterium Xanthobacter strain Py 2 is presented. In the absence of CO 2, whole-cell suspensions of propylene-grown cells catalyzed the isomerization of <b>propylene</b> <b>oxide</b> (epoxypropane) to acetone. In the presence of CO 2, no acetone was produced. Acetone was not metabolized by suspensions of propylene-grown cells, in either the absence or presence of CO 2. The degradation of <b>propylene</b> and <b>propylene</b> <b>oxide</b> by propylene-grown cells supported the fixation of 14 CO 2 into cell material, and {{the time course of}} 14 C fixation correlated with the time course of <b>propylene</b> and <b>propylene</b> <b>oxide</b> degradation. The degradation of glucose and propionaldehyde by propylene-grown or glucose-grown cells did not support significant 14 CO 2 fixation. With <b>propylene</b> <b>oxide</b> as the substrate, the concentration dependence of 14 CO 2 fixation exhibited saturation kinetics, and at saturation, 0. 9 mol of CO 2 was fixed per mol of <b>propylene</b> <b>oxide</b> consumed. Cultures grown with propylene in a nitrogen-deficient medium supplemented with NaH 13 CO 3 specifically incorporated 13 C label into the C- 1 (major labeled position) and C- 3 (minor labeled position) carbon atoms of the endogenous storage compound poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate. No specific label incorporation was observed when cells were cultured with glucose or n-propanol as a carbon source. The depletion of CO 2 from cultures grown with propylene, but not glucose or n-propanol, inhibited bacterial growth.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{epoxidation}} of propylene with hydrogen peroxide {{in the presence}} of acids and halides is studied. The presence of acids and halides is indispensable for increasing the selectivity of the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide, the first step of the direct <b>propylene</b> <b>oxide</b> production from hydrogen, oxygen and propylene. Therefore, we focus on the systematic study of the effect of these compounds on the epoxidation of propylene with hydrogen peroxide in prospective of its future integration with hydrogen peroxide in-situ formed. Indeed, the epoxidation of propylene with hydrogen peroxide is the second step of the direct PO synthesis from hydrogen, oxygen and propylene. The acid concentration and type were shown to {{have an effect on the}} PO selectivity. Sulphuric and hydrochloric acids, typical compounds used to stabilize the hydrogen peroxide, are not suitable for the direct <b>propylene</b> <b>oxide</b> due to their fast dissociation in the solution. This leads to a fast ring opening reaction of the epoxide. Phosphoric acid was shown to have a much milder effect on the <b>propylene</b> <b>oxide</b> selectivity, therefore being an option for the direct <b>propylene</b> <b>oxide</b> synthesis. Also, the amount of halides (NaBr) needed to stabilize the hydrogen peroxide, does not have an effect on the epoxidation step.

No homogeneous reaction nor catalytic decompositions were detected. CO 2 formation was 2 O 3 or complexed with poly(4 -vinylpyridine); gold was supported on MgO. The influence of the ratio of the partial pressures of <b>propylene</b> <b>oxide</b> to <b>propylene</b> on the reaction rate was quantitatively measured on each catalyst and taken as an indication of processes of competitive reactive chemisorption of <b>propylene</b> and <b>propylene</b> <b>oxide.</b> The analysis showed that on silver supported on low area Al 2 O 3, single site adsorption was predominant, while two site adsorption prevailed at the surfaces of the other catalysts tested. Some amount of mixed behavior occurred on all catalysts. Kinetically, the carbon isotope exchange reaction was analyzed in terms of sequence of adsorption-desorption steps.
