5|$|Historically Bournemouth has {{suffered}} from negative rates of natural increase and has relied on immigration to maintain population growth. In 2007 however, births exceeded deaths for the first time, and this trend has continued through to 2011. This, coupled with {{a substantial increase in}} people <b>moving</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> area, has led to a sharp rise in the resident population since 2001. Of the total population, 3.3% are 85 or over, compared to 2.2% nationally; however the largest group of people <b>moving</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> area are students in the 16-24-year age group, and 9% of the current population are between 20 and 24. In England this age group accounts for only 7%.|$|E

Rachel dissipated several hours later on October3. By that time, the winds had decreased to 30mph (45km/h). The remnants of Rachel entered the United States, and were last noted over Texas.|$|E
