50|$|Turkey {{reported}} that between 1957 and 1998, Turkish forces laid 615,419 antipersonnel mines along the Syrian border “to prevent illegal border crossings,” These mines are killing Syrians {{stuck on the}} border or trying to cross near Kobani. Turkey is required under the Mine Ban Treaty, to destroy all antipersonnel mines, but has missed deadlines. Human Rights Watch claims in its report that as of November 18 over 2,000 civilians {{were still in the}} Tel Shair corridor section of the <b>mine</b> <b>belt</b> {{due to the fact that}} Turkey had been refusing entry for cars or livestock, and the refugees did not want to leave behind their belongings.|$|E
50|$|Montgomery was {{concerned}} that the impetus of the offensive was waning. Although by 26 October XXX Corps' infantry had completed the capture of the planned bridgehead west of the second <b>mine</b> <b>belt,</b> the armour of X Corps, although established just beyond the infantry, had failed {{to break through the}} enemy's anti-tank defences. He therefore decided that over the next two days, while continuing the process of attrition, he would thin out his front line to create a reserve with which to restore his momentum. The reserve was to include the New Zealand Division (with 9th Armoured Brigade under command), 10th Armoured Division and 7th Armoured Division.The attacks in the south, which lasted three days and caused considerable losses without achieving a breakthrough, were suspended.|$|E
50|$|At 22:00, {{the four}} {{infantry}} divisions of XXX Corps began to move. The {{objective was to}} establish a bridgehead before dawn at the imaginary line in the desert where the strongest enemy defences were situated, {{on the far side}} of the second <b>mine</b> <b>belt.</b> Once the infantry reached the first minefields, the mine sweepers, including Reconnaissance Corps troops and sappers, moved in to create a passage for the armoured divisions of X Corps. Progress was slower than planned but at 02:00, the first of the 500 tanks crawled forward. By 04:00, the lead tanks were in the minefields, where they stirred up so much dust that there was no visibility at all, traffic jams developed and tanks bogged down. Only about half of the infantry attained their objectives and none of the tanks broke through.|$|E

50|$|In the meantime, {{his forces}} dug in {{and waited for}} the {{eventual}} attack by the British Commonwealth forces or the defeat of the Soviet Army at Stalingrad. Rommel added depth to his defences by creating at least two belts of mines about 5 km apart which were connected at intervals to create boxes which would restrict enemy penetration and deprive British armour of room for manoeuvre. The front face of each box was lightly held by battle outposts {{and the rest of the}} box was unoccupied but sowed with mines and explosive traps and covered by enfilading fire. These became known as the Devil's gardens. The main defensive positions were built to a depth of at least 2 km behind the second <b>mine</b> <b>belt.</b> The Axis laid around half a million mines, mostly Teller anti-tank mines with some smaller anti-personnel types (such as the S-mine). (Many of these mines were British, and had been captured at Tobruk). To lure enemy vehicles into the minefields, the Italians had a trick of dragging an axle and tyres through the fields using a long rope to create what appeared to be well-used tracks.|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{situation}} of the frequent failures of <b>mine</b> <b>belt</b> conveyor during operation, a model was used to evaluate the safety of <b>mine</b> <b>belt</b> conveyor. Based on the foundation of collecting and analyzing a large quantity of fault information of belt conveyor in the nationwide coal mine, the fault tree model of belt conveyor has been built, then the safety evaluation index system was established by analyzing and removing some secondary indicators. Furthermore, the weighted value of safety evaluation indexs was determined by analytic hierarchy process(AHP), and the single factor fuzzy evaluation matrix was constructed by experts grading method. Additionally, the model was applied in evaluating the security of belt conveyor in Nanliang coal mine. The results shows the security level is recognized to the “general”, which means that this model can be adopted widely in evaluating the safety of <b>mine</b> <b>belt</b> conveyor...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{problem of}} reducing energy consumption and dioxide {{emissions in the}} stage of construction and operation of <b>mine</b> <b>belt</b> conveyors is connected with their broad use in the industry. However, this notion is related to a reduction of electric energy consumption for conveyor drive and for production of conveyor components and assemblies (belts, rollers, load-bearing structure etc.). An essential role is played by an increased life of belt conveyors assemblies and components, principally belts. A reduced electric energy consumption results in a decreased CO 2 emissions, e. g. hard coal – fired power station issues 0. 28 kg CO 2 per production of 1 kWh, in to answer production of 1 t steel accounts for 3. 2 t CO 2 emissions.

50|$|Mining {{dates to}} 950 AD with the Toltec and Mayan civilizations. Since the Spanish conquest, {{thousands}} of tons of mercury and lead have been released in the Mexican <b>mining</b> <b>belt,</b> which stretches from Oaxaca to Sonora in the northwest. The Sierra Madre part of this belt is one of the world's most prolific gold and silver mining districts. Georgius Agricola mentioned in 1556 that mining led to deforestation, the disappearance of wild life and watershed contamination. Large areas were deforested to exploit metal deposits. Reforms in the 1990s allowed foreign ownership, and resulted in reopening of mines and increased mining. According to the Secretaría de Economía, 204 mining companies with direct foreign investment had 310 ongoing projects in Mexico in 2006. In 2010, Mexico's mining output reached high levels: 19% of the world's silver production was extracted here, and the <b>mining</b> <b>belt</b> was the world's most productive district as it was historically. The environmental impacts are dramatic, resulting in landscape change and the spread of heavy metals.|$|R
