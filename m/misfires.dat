25|$|The British {{version was}} also {{licensed}} {{for use in}} the United States as the M1, with both the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) and U.S. Navy planning to switch to the 20 mm calibre as soon as the gun could be produced in sufficient numbers. A very large building program was established, along with production of ammunition, in 1941. When delivered, the guns proved to be extremely unreliable and suffered a considerable number of <b>misfires</b> due to the round being lightly struck by the firing pin. The British were interested in using this weapon to ease the demand on production in England, but after receiving the M1 they were disappointed. British wing-mounted fighter weapons by this period were cocked on the ground by the aircraft armourers before flight, the built-in pneumatic cocking mechanism used previously being regarded as unnecessary weight and detrimental to aircraft performance, so any stoppage in flight made the gun unusable until it could be cleared on the ground. The <b>misfires</b> also had the tendency to cause aircraft with wing-mounted guns to yaw away from the wing with the failed gun when the guns were fired, due to the unequal recoil, thus throwing off the pilot's aim.|$|E

The effect of fire through and <b>misfire</b> of WEGS for fraction of seconds at a switch of either GSC or RSC produces oscillations in output power and voltage. <b>Misfire</b> has very little effect on DFIG output and shaft speed than fire through fault [46].

40|$|<b>Misfire</b> {{occurs when}} {{operating}} an {{internal combustion engine}} with air fuel ratio near the lean limit. To extend the <b>misfire</b> limit, the combustion chamber is redesigned to promote turbulence and swirl. An experimental study has been conducted in a constant volume vessel to investigate {{the effects of the}} swirling flow, the spark location, the spark energy, the spark gap and the equivalence ratio on <b>misfire.</b> The relationship between spark location and <b>misfire</b> is investigated for the three following ignition locations: quarter radius from the wall, half radius from the wall and three quarter radius from the wall. The instantaneous velocities are measured using hot wire anemometer. Mixtures of propane and air with equivalence ratios between 0. 5 and 0. 64 have been tested. <b>Misfire</b> was determined using the pressure trace and by visually inspecting the flame through the quartz glass. The <b>misfire</b> probability decreases as the mean swirling velocity and turbulence intensity decay. Also the <b>misfire</b> probability decreases as the ignition point is nearer to the center even though the turbulence intensity is higher than that near the wall. It is postulated that the rate of growth of the flame area (flame stretching) is higher near the wall, therefore the lean <b>misfire</b> limit is richer...|$|R

In terms of gunpowder, the British formula was better manufactured and contained more sulfur than the Chinese mixture.

25|$|A {{well trained}} soldier could fire {{up to three}} rounds per minute, {{and the use of}} the platoon {{formation}} by the British army meant that a constant volley of fire could be employed. There was much that could go wrong with the musket– from <b>misfires</b> in wet weather, to the gun firing at random due to sparks which set the powder off. In the heat of battle a soldier may forget to remove the ramrod from the barrel before firing. Nonetheless, the musket proved to be an overall reliable weapon which's performance, especially when used en masse, should not be underestimated. Even though contemporary writers often state that a musket's effective range when firing at an individual target did not go beyond 30 paces, modern test firings at individual human-sized targets suggest that a musket's effective range lies somewhere between 70 and 100 yards.|$|E
25|$|As {{was normal}} practice, the gunners 'stood to' at 06.30 {{and so were}} ready for action when the German {{warships}} approached. The Germans planned to bombard the batteries for 15 minutes to suppress them before turning the attention to the town. The Seydlitz opened fire at 08.10 and Lt-Col Robson rushed from his home to take up his post as Fire Commander and Battery Medical Officer at Heugh Battery. The first shell cut the Fire Commander's telephone lines, so the whole action was fought by the Battery Commanders on their own under standing orders. At ranges of 4000 to 5000 yards the German shells fell round the batteries without scoring a direct hit. Heugh Battery engaged first the Seydlitz and then the Moltke until they passed out of its arc of fire, and then concentrated on the stationary Blucher which was firing at Lighthouse Battery. Lighthouse Battery scored a direct hit on Blucher's forebridge, disabling two guns of the secondary armament, but suffered a number of <b>misfires</b> due to an electrical fault.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1500s a larger arquebus {{known as the}} musket appeared. The heavy musket, while being rather awkward to handle, {{requiring}} a fork rest to fire properly, {{had the advantage of}} being able to penetrate the best armor within a range of 180 meters, regular armor at 365 meters, and an unarmed man at 548 meters. However, both the musket and arquebus were effectively limited to a range of only 90 to 185 meters regardless of armor since they were incredibly inaccurate. According to some sources, a smoothbore musket was completely incapable of hitting a man sized target past the 73 meter mark. While rifled guns did exist at this time in the form of grooves cut into the interior of a barrel, these were considered specialist weapons and limited in number. In some aspects this made the smoothbore musket an inferior weapon compared to the bow. The average Mamluk archer for example was capable of hitting targets only 68 meters far away but could keep up a pace of six to eight shots per minute. In comparison, sixteenth century matchlocks fired off one shot every several minutes, and much less when taking into consideration <b>misfires</b> and malfunctions which occurred up to half the time. This {{is not to say that}} firearms of the 16th century were inferior to the bow and arrow, for it could better penetrate armor and required less training, but the disadvantages of the musket were very real, and it would not be until the 1590s that archers were for the most part phased out of European warfare. This was possibly a consequence of the increased effectiveness of musket warfare due to the rise of volley fire in Europe as first applied by the Dutch. At this time gunners in European armies reached as high as 40 percent of infantry forces.|$|E

40|$|Even {{though a}} lot of {{research}} has gone into diagnosing <b>misfire</b> in IC engines, most approaches use torsional vibration of the crankshaft, and only a few use the rocking motion (roll) of the engine block. Additionally, <b>misfire</b> diagnosis normally requires an expert to interpret the analysis results from measured vibration signals. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are potential tools for the automated <b>misfire</b> diagnosis of IC engines, as they can learn the patterns corresponding to various faults. This paper proposes an ANN-based automated diagnostic system which combines torsional vibration and rotation of the block for more robust <b>misfire</b> diagnosis. A critical issue with ANN applications is the network training, and it is improbable and/or uneconomical to expect to experience a sufficient number of different faults, or generate them in seeded tests, to obtain sufficient experimental results for the network training. Therefore, new simulation models, which can simulate combustion faults in engines, were developed. The simulation models are based on the thermodynamic and mechanical principles of IC engines and therefore the proposed <b>misfire</b> diagnostic system can in principle be adapted for any engine. During the building process of the models, based on a particular engine, some mechanical and physical parameters, for example the inertial properties of the engine parts and parameters of engine mounts, were first measured and calculated. A series of experiments were then carried out to capture the vibration signals for both normal condition and with a range of faults. The simulation models were updated and evaluated by the experimental results. Following the signal processing of the experimental and simulation signals, the best features were selected as the inputs to ANN networks. The automated diagnostic system comprises three stages: <b>misfire</b> detection, <b>misfire</b> localization and severity identification. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and Probabilistic Neural Networks were applied in the different stages. The final results have shown that the diagnostic system can efficiently diagnose different <b>misfire</b> conditions, including location and severity. status: publishe...|$|R
