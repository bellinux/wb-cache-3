60|$|I do {{not know}} whether hotel {{servants}} in New York get any wages or not, but I do know that in some of the hotels there the feeing system in vogue is a heavy burden. The waiter expects a quarter at breakfast--and gets it. You have a different waiter at luncheon, and so he gets a quarter. Your waiter at dinner is another stranger--consequently he gets a quarter. The boy who carries your satchel to your room and lights your gas fumbles around and hangs around significantly, and you fee him to get rid of him. Now you may ring for ice-water; and ten minutes later for a lemonade; and ten minutes afterward, for a cigar; and by and by for a newspaper--and what is the result? Why, a new boy has appeared every time and fooled and fumbled around until you have paid him something. Suppose you boldly put your foot down, and say it is the hotel's business to pay its servants? You will have to ring your bell ten or fifteen times before you get a servant there; and when he goes off to fill your order you will grow old and infirm before you see him again. You may struggle nobly for twenty-four hours, <b>maybe,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are an adamantine sort of person, but in the mean time you will have been so wretchedly served, and so insolently, that you will haul down your colors, and go to impoverishing yourself with fees.|$|E

40|$|Have {{you ever}} watched {{professional}} snowboarders before? If so, {{one of the}} first things you may have noticed was the many impressive tricks and skilled maneuvers they execute during a run. <b>Maybe,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are a snowboarder, you have even learned to do some of these tricks yourself. One of the most impressive of these maneuvers involves the snowboarder doing jumps over a very large semicircle shaped structure, commonly known as a “halfpipe. ” Although the tricks many experienced snowboarders can perform are very impressive, is it possible that with the use of a more finely tuned “halfpipe” design, snowboarders could execute even more impressive tricks? During our team’s participation in the Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications contest—a competition in which a team of three students attempts to solve a given real-world math-related problem—this is exactly what we investigated. We carefully looked at designs for “halfpipes” and came up with our own version in an attempt to solve the given problem...|$|E
40|$|We {{have written}} this paper about {{gambling}} {{problems with the}} purpose to give us {{and all of our}} readers a sense of understanding. With the term understanding we mean that we all know what type of activity gambling is but not a lot of us know how it feels for individuals that due to their addiction play almost every day and sometimes several times a day. By somehow trying to explain what kind of experiences people who engage in gambling feel, we hope that we somehow can increase our knowledge towards these persons and towards gambling. We are well informed that the content of our particular subject that we’ve chosen is massive and that more research needs to be done about or subject since there are no simple answers that can explain gambling behavior so easily. But by giving it an effort to at least give a glance of the many reasons of how they feel when they gamble we hope to find some comprehension for gamblers and people that suffer from gambling problems. Our presentation of problem is to simply try to explain what kind of feelings gamblers experience when they place a bet and what consequences their gambling has led to. And by reading lots of books about our subject and by interviewing people that gamble we hope to come to some conclusions for such behaviour. When it comes to interviewing people that does gamble we deliberately chose to interview different types of gamblers just to show the broadness that does exist among people that engage in gambling activity. We did this with the simple purpose that it gives us a stronger sense of comprehension about gamblers. We also hope to insight the society about gambling problems and that their consequences does not just affect the gambler but also family and friends {{and when it comes to}} treatment due to gambling problems such help should be provided for all. Gambling activities is a matter that affects all of society since its becoming a stronger part of our everyday life since many of us engage in the chase of “fast money”. But one must remember that this is an addiction that is much harder to knowledge since many of us can play in the comfort of our one’s homes which means that it is harder to detect. We hope that by you reading this paper you will increase your knowledge about this group or <b>maybe</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> know a person that does gamble you will understand him or her better and come to the realization that he or she needs help for her addiction...|$|E

[...] McGrath praised Ricks for pointing out connections between Dylan's work and other poets and cultural figures that are [...] "surprising and provocative. At various points he compares Mr. Dylan to Marvell, Marlowe, Keats, Tennyson, Hardy, Yeats and Marlon Brando, to cite {{just a few of}} his references." [...] McGrath goes on to suggest that some passages in Dylan's Visions of Sin may strike some readers as over the top, as when Mr. Ricks devotes four pages (and four footnotes) to the lyrics of [...] "All the Tired Horses," [...] a song that is only two lines long—or <b>maybe</b> three, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> count the long [...] "hmmmm" [...] at the end.

40|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> {{were asked}} whether you had {{consumed}} illicit drugs recently, would <b>you</b> admit it? <b>Maybe.</b> <b>If</b> yes, could <b>you</b> precisely recall the types of drug, times and amounts consumed? Possibly. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> were the person commissioned with the task to objectively quantify drug use in your country, what approach would you use, given the social stigma attached with such behaviour? A complementary approach to traditional methods – including interview surveys, crime records, hospitalization data – is the analysis of sewage. Quantitative measurements of drug target residues in urban sewage deliver near-real-time data on the drug use {{of thousands of people}} that contributed to the sewage samples. For selected European cities, covering over 14 million people, weekly profiles and trends over the years 2011 to 2013 will be presented along with unique data from the United States, Australia, Germany and Switzerland. Sewage is not only an increasingly important resource – i. e. water reuse in regions suffering from water scarcity – it also contains a wealth of information. Therefore, sewage analysis will be further developed and applied to other excreted biomarkers of endogenous human metabolism. As such, it will serve as an early detection system (e. g. pandemics) and indicator of various public health aspects that goes far beyond illicit drugs only. At relatively low cost, it covers entire communities and it is thought to be faster than online data gathering techniques, such as quantifying individual Google searches from people checking online for symptoms of any kind of disease...|$|R

Familiarity is not always a bad thing, and if the script, by Shauna Cross, piles sports movie and coming-of-age touchstones into a veritable cairn of clichés, the cast shows enough agility and conviction to make them seem almost fresh." [...] Roger Ebert said it's a [...] "coming-together of two free spirits, Drew Barrymore and Ellen Page, and while it may not reflect the kind of female empowerment Gloria Steinem had in mind, it has guts, charm, and a black-and-blue sweetness." [...] According to The Miami Herald, [...] "Whip It is completely predictable from the first frame. It also is ridiculously, utterly entertaining. Drew Barrymore's smashing directorial debut harkens back to an era in which Hollywood studio pictures could still move and enthrall the audience while plying in hoary cliches." ...|$|R

When asked whether the league was becoming more guard-oriented and big men were being de-emphasized, Olajuwon responded, [...] "For a big man who is just big, <b>maybe.</b> But not <b>if</b> <b>you</b> play with speed, with agility.

In September, 2009, he also worked with Kobe Bryant on the post moves and the Dream Shake.
