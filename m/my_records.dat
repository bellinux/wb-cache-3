"People were {{literally}} scared of <b>my</b> <b>records.</b> There {{have been so}} many rumors about me and <b>my</b> <b>records.</b> People got the first album, and they would just make up stories. They'd get into an accident and be like, 'I got into an accident because I was playing that tape.' It wasn't like we helped ourselves when we described what was in people's heads. It wasn't to shock people, though, but to get people involved in what we were doing. We had to get peoples' attention. [...] We said {{a lot of things that}} people wanted to say but didn't say. We talked about a lot of political and social [...] that people didn't want to talk about." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was this}} concept which {{intrigued}} Madonna, {{while she was}} developing her third studio album True Blue (1986). She said, [...] "I hate it when people do master mixes of <b>my</b> <b>records.</b> I don't want to hear my songs changed like that. I don't know that I like it, people screwing with <b>my</b> <b>records.</b> The jury is out on it for me. But the fans like it, and really, this one was for the fans, for {{the kids in the}} clubs who wanted to hear these songs in a fresh new way." [...] She went to Warner with the idea of releasing her songs by remixing them in a complete dance tune. From Warner's point of view, the rise of remix was a commercial boon, because it meant making more money out of the same piece of music. Instead of paying Madonna to go to studio and record different tracks, they found that allowing her to record the same tracks in different formats was much less costly. Hence they decided to release the album, but gave full freedom to Madonna to choose the producers with whom she wanted to develop the remixes.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{think most}} of the time when <b>my</b> <b>records</b> come out, people are so much distracted by so much fanfare and {{controversy}} that nobody pays attention to the music. [...] I can't tell you how painful the idea of singing 'Like a Virgin' or 'Material Girl' (1984) is to me now. I didn't write either of those songs, and wasn't digging very deep then. I also feel more connected emotionally to the music I'm writing now, so it's more of a pleasure to do it." ...|$|E

I got to choose the music, but this time around it was, like, I'd sit down and think: 'What {{happened}} to me yesterday? What happened to me today?' and just write. It was very therapeutic, in a way. And easy – I was shocked at {{how easy it was}} to be honest about yourself and things that affect you. It is a dance record, but I wanted it to be serious. I wanted to talk about serious things, but do it in a not-so-serious way, with music that makes you want to get up and dance.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the album's release, Cooder {{played a}} union hall in San Francisco for a longshoremen's union, which {{according}} to him, [...] "got every turn of phrase. They'd never heard of me before or any of <b>my</b> <b>records,</b> but they understood all of these lyric things immediately. Because they've been educated in the union, you know what I mean? Because they lived it." [...] On October 14, Cooder performed at This Land Is Your Land, a concert at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. in tribute to Woody Guthrie. Cooder did not tour in promotion of Election Special, as the Kennedy Center was his last show. In an interview for The Strand at the time, he expressed disinterest in playing larger concert venues for the album, finding them more suitable for [...] "fame" [...] purposes rather than spreading a political message. Cooder remarked on the album's potential with listeners in general in an interview for Uncut, saying that: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} at Flyte Tyme studios in Edina, Minnesota. Songs on the album, {{with the exception}} of [...] "What'll I Do", were written by Janet Jackson, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and mixed by Steve Hodge and Dave Rideau; [...] "What'll I Do" [...] was written and produced by Jackson and Jellybean Johnson. Jackson took a larger role in songwriting and production than she did on her previous albums. She explained that [...] "ll <b>my</b> <b>records</b> are personal, and janet, is the most personal of them all. That's why this time around it was important for me to write all the lyrics and half of the melodies." [...] Jam described the record as being [...] "a more mature album musically." [...] David Ritz noted that Jackson and her producers took risks by experimenting with musical influences that had not appeared in their previous work. He explained: [...] "She asked Kathleen Battle and Public Enemy's Chuck D to contribute—an opera diva and a hardcore rapper, two artists one would not associate with Janet—and somehow pulled if off. Beyond Jam and Lewis, there's now a recognizable Janet Jackson production style that's gutsy and, in some cases, even eccentric." ...|$|E

500|$|In Argentine society, Messi is {{generally}} held in lesser esteem than Maradona, {{a consequence of}} not only his uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi {{is in some ways}} the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football. An enduring mark against him is the fact that, although through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera División as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt—he does not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays—have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine. Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi has said: [...] "Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all <b>my</b> <b>records</b> to make the people in my country happy." [...] In November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they haven't been given their salaries for six months. He has stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the largely}} {{positive}} view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 {{that he had}} at some point announced, [...] "The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy <b>my</b> <b>records</b> and shine my shoes." [...] A journalist with the national African American weekly Jet, Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of Jailhouse Rock, Presley granted Robinson an interview, though {{he was no longer}} dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement or holding in any way to its racist view: [...] "I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that." [...] Also, Red Robinson stated, [...] "Take a look at the things that are only publicized now, of how he'd be driving down the street and see a destitute black woman with a little child. He went and bought her a Cadillac. Now if this guy hated blacks, he wouldn't even have gone near them". Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist. Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening, reported of Presley, [...] "He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest." [...] Dudley Brooks, an African-American composer and studio musician who worked with Presley during the 1950s and 1960s, also disputed allegations that Presley was a racist. Though the rumored remark was wholly discredited at the time, it was still being used against Presley decades later. The identification of Presley with racism—either personally or symbolically—was expressed most famously in the lyrics of the 1989 rap hit [...] "Fight the Power", by Public Enemy: [...] "Elvis was a hero to most / But he never meant shit to me / Straight-up racist that sucker was / Simple and plain".|$|E

Thus, in <b>my</b> <b>records,</b> my [...] "Bank" [...] ledger account has an asset credit balance, which is reduced by the credit for £200.

2500|$|In 1957, Presley had {{to defend}} himself from claims of being a racist: he was alleged to have said: [...] "The only thing Negro people can do for me is to buy <b>my</b> <b>records</b> and shine my shoes." [...] The singer always denied saying, or ever wanting to say, such a racist remark. Jet magazine, run by and for African-Americans, {{subsequently}} investigated the story and found no basis to the claim. However, the Jet journalist did find plenty of testimony that Presley judged people [...] "regardless of race, color or creed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2008, {{the band}} Inhabited {{mentioned}} BarlowGirl in an [...] "uncensored" [...] remix of its [...] "Hush" [...] single. Inhabited released the album The Revolution in 2005 with then-fellow record label Fervent Records, but left the label in 2007 and signed with 7Spin Music for its album Love in 2008. The remix, {{which was a}} free download, included lyrics such as [...] "We're gonna beat that system in a round about way / Won't make sucky music so <b>my</b> <b>records</b> will play" [...] and [...] "Something more like BarlowGirl, do something right / Ain’t got nothing against ‘em but it just ain’t me", causing controversy in the Christian music community. Inhabited responded by saying: [...] "it wasn't to bash or put them down, it just says our art is a different style. They have achieved great success, and we would wish them no less! [...] Lastly, [...] we thought [...] a fun, cool remix. We have always been straightforward with our lyrics and always will be." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wilson {{works out}} [...] "about a third" [...] of the {{finished}} arrangement of a song as he's writing it, leaving the rest to studio experimentation. As he writes in 1990: [...] "Making an instrumental track is a whole experience. It starts after you have written a song. As I write a song, I write some of the instrumental piano and pluck some of the different notes for the arrangement. It's impossible to lay the whole arrangement on the piano but you play just {{enough to get the}} overall feelin’ of the record. It is an art in itself. I always get that bigger picture of <b>my</b> <b>records</b> at my piano before I record them. I go in there prepared." [...] From the very beginning, Wilson handled most stages of the group's recording process, despite Nik Venet being credited for producing their early recordings. He preferred mixing live as performances were recorded, as opposed to mixing after the fact. He was open to changes suggested by others while recording, often taking advice and even incorporating apparent mistakes if they provided a useful or interesting alternative. On Surfin' U.S.A. (1963), Brian began doubletracking. As was practiced by other record producers from the 1960s, most of his mixes ended up in single-channel monaural, believing that varied stereo speaker placement took his control over the sound image away to the listener.|$|E
2500|$|After {{taking a}} five-month break from writing and touring, the Wallflowers {{set out to}} make their third album, (Breach). [...] Dylan was very diligent in the songwriting process; he rented a studio near his home and would {{routinely}} go there to write songs for the album. [...] However, Dylan was not satisfied with the first batch of songs he came up with. [...] He decided to scrap them and start over. [...] The songs that did make it to the studio were considered to be far more personal than any of the songs the Wallflowers had released in the past. [...] Dylan explained; [...] "I think all my songs are personal, but I just made them a little more dense before, made 'em real thick so that I didn't feel exposed. A lot of younger writers do that. [...] Before, I haven't really wanted anybody buying <b>my</b> <b>records</b> looking for information about myself or my family, but at this point, the group has a lot of people buying the records who aren't interested in that, so it gives me more freedom." [...] By the end of 1999, the Wallflowers were ready to begin recording. [...] The bulk of the album was recorded at Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles. [...] The Wallflowers' longtime manager, Andrew Slater co-produced the album with Michael Penn. [...] The band took their time in the studio. [...] Like Bringing Down the Horse, (Breach) took about eight months to record. [...] (Breach) also featured an array of guest artists including Elvis Costello, Mike Campbell and Frank Black.|$|E
2500|$|Many critics {{considered}} the song a [...] "diss" [...] towards Lil' Kim, [...] {{who has been}} in disputes with Minaj since the beginning of her career. Mariel Concepcion of Billboard dissected the song stating [...] "Nicki Minaj's highly-talked about [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] track hit the net over the weekend, and the Harajuku Barbie appears to be taking jabs at Lil' Kim." [...] In the first verse Minaj takes shots saying [...] "Look at my show footage how these girls be spazzing/So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been/Yeah I said it has-been/hang it up/flatscreen" [...] then again [...] "You out of work/I know it's tough/but enough is enough/" [...] Minaj then specifically takes jabs at Baltimore rapper Keys and Lil'Kim in the second verse rapping, [...] "Is this the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on/ is it my fault that all of you bitches gone/" [...] and following this line this infered she was talking about Lil' Kim [...] "Nicki she just mad cause you took the spot/ word that bitch mad cause I took the spot/ Well bitch if you aint shitting then get off the pot/Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off ya top/. Minaj also subliminally took jabs at rapper Keys with [...] "I see them dusty ass Filas, Levi's/ Raggedy Ann's/ Holes in your knee highs". Lil' Kim fired back at the song at a club-concert, stating [...] "I will erase this bitch’s social security number. First of all, I don’t even need a record right now and I’d kill that bitch with my old shit. <b>My</b> <b>records</b> ain’t just enter the charts, they made history. What the fuck is this bullshit, this shit come and go!" [...] Minaj later stated in an interview on The Wendy Williams Show that, [...] "They know what I'm talking about. See that's the thing when you put out records; you know only the 'guilty ones' feel like you're talking about them. So you know, if you have nothing to worry about, if you haven't came out saying stuff, if you never came out saying your ungrateful bullshit then you wouldn't worry about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Like a Prayer {{was named}} after the {{influence}} of Catholicism on Madonna's early {{life as well as}} her struggles with religion; [...] "The theme of Catholicism runs rampant", she said. [...] "It's me struggling with the mystery and magic that surrounds it. My own Catholicism is in constant upheaval." [...] Recording sessions took place from September 1988 to January 1989. On January 27, 1989, a press release from The Albany Herald said the album would include [...] "a number of hot dance tracks" [...] but noted, [...] "much of the material [...] is of a personal tone." [...] The singer described it as a collection of songs [...] "about my mother, my father, and bonds with my family. [...] It's taken a lot of guts to do this". She also said that it would be her [...] "most different" [...] work to date; [...] "It was a real coming-of-age record for me emotionally, I had {{to do a lot of}} soul-searching, and I think it is a reflection of that [...] I didn't try to candy-coat anything or make it more palatable for mass consumption, I wrote what I felt". She told Rolling Stone magazine [...] "In the past, <b>my</b> <b>records</b> tended to be a reflection of current influences. This album is more about past musical influences". She chose to collaborate with Stephen Bray and Patrick Leonard, with whom she had collaborated on her previous studio album True Blue (1986) and the soundtrack Who's That Girl (1987). Both Bray and Leonard wanted to bring their unique style to the project, and they developed completely different music for the title track. Eventually, Madonna felt that the music presented to her by Leonard was more interesting, and she started to work with him. According to the singer, Leonard was also facing emotional turmoil; [...] "I was working with Pat, who was also in a very dark state of mind, and we worked in a very isolated place in the Valley". On January 6, 1989, following a nullified divorce filing in late 1987 and several publicized fights, one of which led to a 60-day prison term, Madonna and Sean Penn filed for divorce. [...] This incident inspired the song [...] "Till Death Do Us Part". The rest of the songs were written within two weeks; with [...] "Like a Prayer", [...] "Cherish" [...] and [...] "Spanish Eyes" [...] being written the first week. According to Leonard, [...] "we wrote a song a day, and we didn't change them. And oftentimes the vocal that she did was the lead vocal, we didn't even change the lead vocal. That was it. She sang it. It was done".|$|E
