5000|$|The {{erosion of}} Switzerland's fabled bank secrecy that began when Switzerland amended its federal banking law in 2009 {{in the wake}} of the UBS scandal, a cycle that culminated when Switzerland officially signed the Convention on <b>Mutual</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Assistance</b> in Tax Matters on 15 October 2013, began with Birkenfeld's revelations. [...] Signing the convention, an {{international}} tax treaty with nearly 60 signatories that facilitates the exchange of tax data between countries, represents a rollback of Switzerland's status as a tax haven for offshore assets.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a public}} {{perception}} that offshore investment funds are responsible for tax leakage in relation to cross border investment, and various laws have been passed by various countries shaped by that belief. Probably {{the best example of}} that is the American Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). But earlier examples also included the application of the European Union withholding tax to the British Overseas Territories (including popular offshore fund domiciles like the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands). The most recent (and ongoing) example is the Convention on <b>Mutual</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Assistance</b> in Tax Matters which almost every major offshore fund domicile has agreed to be bound by.|$|E

5000|$|The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) is an {{information}} {{standard for the}} automatic exchange of tax and financial information on a global level, which the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) developed in 2014. Its purpose is to combat tax evasion. The idea {{was based on the}} USA Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) implementation agreements and its legal basis is the Convention on <b>Mutual</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Assistance</b> in Tax Matters. As of 2016, 83 countries had signed an agreement to implement it. First reporting is planned September 2017. The CRS has been criticised for leaving too many loopholes open, for how developing countries were not considered and involved and that non-reciprocity agreements were catering to tax havens.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{countries}} have entered into tax treaties (also called double tax agreements, or DTAs) {{with other countries}} to avoid or mitigate double taxation. Such treaties may cover a range of taxes including income taxes, inheritance taxes, value added taxes, or other taxes. Besides bilateral treaties, multilateral treaties are also in place. For example, European Union (EU) countries are parties to a multilateral agreement with respect to value added taxes under auspices of the EU, while a joint treaty on <b>mutual</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>assistance</b> of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) {{is open to all}} countries. Tax treaties tend to reduce taxes of one treaty country for residents of the other treaty country to reduce double taxation of the same income.|$|E

Cross-border recovery protects the state's fiscal policy and safeguards the supply of assets for the treasury. Assistance is provided not only under the national and the European laws governing disputes among EU member states but also outside the EU thanks to international treaties that have been ratified by the Parliament of the Czech Republic and that are now binding for the country, and thanks to the OECD Convention on <b>Mutual</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Assistance</b> in Tax Matters that provides for assistance across the continents...|$|E
