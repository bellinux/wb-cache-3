Regarding the album's sound, rhythm guitarist Joey D'Amico remarked in September 2001 that [...] "the music is definitely emotional, but its hardcore in its roots". Songs such as [...] "Falling Down" [...] and [...] "Rejection" [...] feature a volatile brand of singing which frequently alternates between melodic crooning, rapping and more extreme vocal stylings.

It starts off fast and heavy and brutal, and then, from the bridge and chorus to the end, it makes you cry. That song right there covers it all." ...|$|E
