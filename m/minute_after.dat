40|$|Objective: Left {{ventricular}} {{wall stress}} {{has been investigated}} {{in a variety of}} populations, but the effect of food intake has not been evaluated. We assessed whether left ventricular wall stress is affected by food intake in healthy subjects. Methods: Twenty-three healthy subjects aged 25. 6 +/- 4. 5 years were investigated. Meridional end-systolic wall stress (ESS) and circumferential end-systolic wall stress (cESS) were measured before, 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>after,</b> and 110 <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> a standardised meal. Results: Both ESS and cESS decreased significantly (P < 0. 001) from fasting values 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> the meal, and had not returned to baseline <b>after</b> 110 <b>minutes.</b> ESS decreased from 65 +/- 16 kdynes/cm(2) (fasting) to 44 +/- 12 kdynes/cm(2) 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>after,</b> and to 58 +/- 13 kdynes/cm(2) 110 <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> eating. cESS decreased from 98 +/- 24 kdynes/cm(2) to 67 +/- 18 kdynes/cm(2) 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>after,</b> and to 87 +/- 19 kdynes/cm(2) 110 <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> the meal.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the dynamics of the brain free fatty acid (FFA) pool in rats exposed to: (a) controlled hypoxia, and (b) experimental epilepsy. Animals from group (a) were subjected to hypoxia procedure. Immediately, 5, 15 or 60 <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> losing the righting reflex, the animals were decapitated and brains were quickly removed. Animals from group (b) received penicillin (5000 U/ 5 pi) into the left lateral ventricle and were decapitated immediately, 5 or 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> the appearance of epileptic seizures. The FFA were quantified by gas chromatography. An increase in the total brain FFA content with the maximum level at 60 <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> losing the righting reflex was detected in hypoxia- exposed rats. The highest level of the brain free arachidonic acid (FAA) was detected 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> hypoxia.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous {{investigators}} have described an association be-tween polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) use in hip arthroplasty and cardiovascular derange-ment. Our {{purpose was to}} evaluate the effects of PMMA injection on patient vital signs during percutaneous vertebroplasty.

These data were obtained for 142 injections (78 patients), and preinjection vital signs were compared with vital signs during and after PMMA injection. Multivariable regression modeling was used to ascertain the effects of cardiopulmonary comorbidities on vital signs. RESULTS: Mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate during, 5 <b>minutes</b> <b>after,</b> and 10 <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> PMMA injection {{were not significantly different}} from their respective preproce-dure values (P. 19 –. 92).
