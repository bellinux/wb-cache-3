In Hesperiidae the tribe Pyrrhopygini have a modal n = 28, Eudaminae and Pyrgini a modal n = 31, while Hesperiinae have n = around 29. Among Pieridae, Coliadinae {{have a strong}} modal n = 31 and among Pierinae Anthocharidini are almost fixed for n = 15 while Pierini vary with n = 26 as the most common chromosome number.

The charaxines {{do not have}} a distinct <b>modal</b> <b>number.</b> Their chromosome numbers are in the range n = 6 – 50, with n = 7 – 9, n = 12, n = 16, n = 19 – 21, n = 26, and n = 28 – 31 being the most common numbers. Within the Morphinae, the Morphini have a modal n = 28 and the Brassolini a modal n = 29, with few exceptions. The Neotropical satyrines, in particular the basal species, have a weak modal n = 29, which is a strong <b>modal</b> <b>number</b> in Palearctic satyrines. The African satyrines have an equally strong modal n = 28. Most Neotropical satyrines have, like charaxines, chromosome numbers lower than the weak modal n = 29, and often half this modal, but there are genera with stable numbers among the satyrines and charaxines.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of meiotic {{chromosomes}} in air-dried preparations from 30 genitally sound rams (Ovis aries). Three of the rams had a normal mitotic karyotype (2 n = 54) and the remainder were carriers of the t 1, t 2 and t 3 Robertsonian translocations in various heterozygous and homozygous combinations. The studies on the primary spermatocytes showed that the normal rams had a <b>modal</b> <b>number</b> of 27 chromosomal elements and the translocation-carrying rams were recorded with a <b>modal</b> <b>number</b> of either 24 or 25. The translocation in the heterozygous state was characterized {{by the presence of}} a trivalent in cells at the diplotene, diakinesis and metaphase I stages, while in the homozygous state it was characterized by the presence of a bivalent. The <b>modal</b> <b>number</b> of chromosomal elements was recorded in 90. 5 to 97. 3 percent of the cells at diakinesis and metaphase I in the translocation-carrying rams. The <b>modal</b> <b>number</b> of chromosomal elements was recorded in 88. 3 percent of the cells in the normal rams. An association between the sex bivalent and a small autosomal bivalent was recorded in 3. 5 to 5. 3 percent of the cells at diakinesis and metaphase I in the translocation-carrying rams. Eight percent of the cells in the normal rams were seen with a sex bivalent association. The sex chromosomes were separated in 0. 0 to 1. 1 percent of the cells at diakinesis and metaphase I in the translocation-carrying rams, while 0. 7 percent of the cells in the normal rams had separated sex chromosomes. However, aneuploidy involving the sex chromosomes was not observed in the secondary spermatocytes from the normal and translocation-carrying rams. A total of 1, 757 secondary spermatocytes were counted from 27 translocation-carrying rams and 103 secondary spermatocytes from 3 normal rams. The studies on the secondary spermatocytes showed that the <b>modal</b> <b>number</b> of 30 chromosome arms was recorded in 87. 3 to 96. 0 percent of the non-polyploid cells in the translocation-carrying rams and 95. 2 percent of the cells in the normal rams. No hypermodal cells were found in the normal rams. Hypermodal cells were recorded in 0. 0 to 3. 6 per cent of the non-polyploid cells in the translocation-carrying rams. There were individual variations in the percentage of hypermodal cells recorded in rams with identical karyotypes. There were also significantly greater numbers of cells with 29 chromosome arms than with 31 chromosome arms in the translocation-carrying rams. This suggested that chromosome loss due to lagging at anaphase I or technical manipulation, must have occurred in addition to non-disjunction. A significant surplus of secondary spermatocytes of normal karyotype and a deficit of 25, t 1 t 3 were found in the metaphase II figures from the triple heterozygous rams. Significantly uneven distributions of segregation products were also found in the multiple translocation-carrying rams with karyotypes of 50,xy,t 1 t 2 t 2 t 3 and 49,xy,t 1 t 2 t 2 t 3 tx. The translocation-carrying sheep have been shown to have good conception rates and an average breeding performance. This would suggest that only balanced (euploid) spermatozoa are involved in fertilization and the unbalanced (aneuploid) spermatocytes fail to mature into spermatozoa and are selected against or degenerate during spermatogenesis. The evidence indicates that the fertility of the ram is unaffected by the presence of the translocation chromosomes and consequently these sheep should not be eliminated arbitrarily from our animal populations...|$|E

All cells examined contained at least one copy of each normal chromosome with the exception of chromosome # 1. in which a whole copy along with parts of the second copy was found in the marker chromo-some's composition. In 65 % of the cells. trisomy of chromosome # 15 was observed. Nearly all cells contained only one X-chromosome. The 13 marker chromosomes that frequently oc-curred are described. and the presumed origin of seven of these chromosomes is described in detail. Comparison of the karyo-type of murine L 1210 leukemia with the karyotypes of other leukemias of the mouse showed the existence of similar chromo-some aberrations. Among these aberrations. the trisomy of chromosome # 15 and monosomy of the X-chromosome may be of special importance.

Mouse lymphoblastic leukemia Ll 21 O. originated over 30 years ago by Law et al. in 1949 (1). is still widely used in cancer research. Karyotypic findings obtained with the Ll 210 line in the ascites form are of considerable interest because the presence of marker chromosomes and shifts in <b>modal</b> <b>number</b> can be used as indices of drug sensitivity or resistance (2 - 5).

40|$|Summary. -Cytogenetic data on 103 seminomata and {{malignant}} teratomata of the testis {{from the}} literature and (partly {{in the form of}} DNA measurements) from this laboratory show that <b>modal</b> chromosome <b>numbers</b> are generally 50 or more. The only exceptions were 2 seminomata in which diploid and pseudodiploid karyotypes respectively were found, but the dividing cells may not have been tumour cells. Malignant tumours of the testis thus differ from those of all other sites (including the ovary) that have been studied sufficiently, where hypodiploid tumours are common. The reason for this difference is unknown. Mechanisms whereby high chromosome numbers, particularly the near-triploid numbers commonly found in testicular tumours, may be achieved are discussed briefly. A RECENT review of <b>modal</b> chromosome <b>numbers</b> and DNA values of malignant tumours in man (Atkin, 1973 a) has shown that at most sites the tumours tend to fall into 2 groups, a near-diploid group...|$|R
40|$|A case of canine {{fibrosarcoma}} having prominent metastatic {{changes over}} the entire lungs and some other organs was described. Chromosome studies in cultured cells revealed that the tumor cells showed hypodiploid <b>modal</b> chromosome <b>numbers</b> 54 and 56, with many biarmed chromosomes. The general karyotypic similarity among certain canine tumors such as venereal sarcomas, lymphosarcomas and the presen t case is discussed...|$|R
