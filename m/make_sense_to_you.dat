50|$|The Encoding/decoding {{model of}} {{communication}} was first developed by cultural studies scholar Stuart Hall in 1973. Titled 'Encoding and Decoding in the Television Discourse', Hall's essay offers a theoretical approach of how media messages are produced, disseminated, and interpreted. As an important {{member of the}} Birmingham School of Cultural Studies, Hall had {{a major influence on}} media studies. His model claims that television and other media audiences are presented with messages that are decoded, or interpreted in different ways depending on an individual's cultural background, economic standing, and personal experiences. In contrast to other media theories that disempower audiences, Hall proposed that audience members can play an active role in decoding messages as they rely on their own social contexts, and might be capable of changing messages themselves through collective action. In simpler terms, encoding/decoding is the translation of a message that is easily understood. When you decode a message, you extract the meaning of that message in ways that <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Decoding has both verbal and non-verbal forms of communication: Decoding behavior without using words means observing body language and its associated emotions. For example, some body language signs for when someone is upset, angry, or stressed would be a use of excessive hand/arm movements, red in the face, crying, and even sometimes silence. Sometimes when someone is trying to get a message across to someone, the message can be interpreted differently from person to person. Decoding is all about the understanding of what someone already knows, based on the information given throughout the message being received. Whether there is a large audience or exchanging a message to one person, decoding is the process of obtaining, absorbing, understanding, and sometimes using the information that was given throughout a verbal or non-verbal message.|$|E

40|$|During {{conflict}} mediation children learn {{skills necessary to}} reach peaceful resolutions. These skills involve communication, compromise, {{the ability to see}} how different aspects of a dispute are related, and the ability to consider their own perspective {{as well as that of}} another person. At first children need a great deal of support to proceed all the way to a negotiated settlement. The adult mediator provides this support, serving as an instructor. As children learn problem-solving words and procedures, they become increasingly capable of solving problems for themselves. There is evidence that these childhood learnings are maintained throughout the adult years. Like other social skills, children require numerous opportunities to practice conflict resolution under the guidance of a more experienced person. This eight-step conflict/mediation model can help adults successfully guide children through conflict resolution. Adults play an important role in helping children develop social skills. Children between ages 3 and 10 need to have positive give-and-take social interactions. They need mini-lessons on how to cultivate positive interactions between themselves and others in their social network. Anyone who has more than two children in their care will encounter conflict. With practice using the eight-step conflict resolution/mediation model you can successfully guide children through resolving their conflicts. This model can be used with children who have developed skills and can verbalize their feelings, usually age three or older. The role of the adult/mediator in this model is very important. Key points to remember when implementing the model with the children are: • Physical contact is very important. Hold the children. You may rub their backs during the interaction to reinforce your support for each child. (Not all children want to be touched in a conflict situation. If you have noted, on a number of occasions, the child is uncomfortable with being touched, you may want to look into it further.) • Ask, “What happened here?” Make sure each child is given uninterrupted time to explain their view of the situation, within boundaries. • Accept and reinforce the solution agreed on by the children. It may not <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> • Remain calm at all times during the process. Use simple, concrete language. Paraphrase any language that is hurtful. • End with an open-ended question. Example: “Neither one of you are getting what you want. What can we do to solve this problem?” •Give the children lots of time to form their thoughts and speak. A question that can be answered with yes or no is not an open-ended question...|$|E
40|$|Translation begins] Friday My Darling, I’m happy today- got {{a letter}} from you. The mailman just came. Gee, honey, I love you so. What a day. It’s all cloudy and looks as though it were going to rain any second. Hope it doesn’t. Have to go shopping- {{strictly}} window shopping- in New Rochelle and Mt. Vernon. Having more trouble trying to find a negligee that isn’t marquisette (any way the kind that you can’t see through. They’re all like celephane [sic].) Maybe today I’ll find one. Shooting skeet must be hard. That sounds good- 19 out of 25. I’d be amazed to come close to one out of 25. That’s something else you’ll have to teach me- how to shoot. Then when I catch you running ‘round with other women I can be real dramatic about it. Goley [sic], honey, I wish you’d finish that night flying. It must be awful to fly so late + then get up at the same ungodly hour in the morning. Anytime you’re too tired or don’t feel like writing don’t. Not that you would but don’t feel that you have to. I realize how hard it is for you to write so often. I hope it doesn’t rain on March 11 th. Oh, that reminds me. I had the craziest dream last night. We got married + then you disappeared suddenly right after the ceremony and the next thing I remember you were flying around. It was so vivid. You were buzzing all the houses and I was trying to get your attention. I can remember I had my wedding dress on + it looked very nice but you wouldn’t come down. Then this fellow from the Navy Air Corps came + we were talking (this must have been a hangover from “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo”.) He looked like Bob- the one Van Johnson was going to buy a ranch with. He was complaining about how fresh the Marines were. I was telling him what had happened + he wanted to know what else I could expect from a Marine. After about five minutes I’d convinced him that you weren’t a marine + were the the [sic] best pilot in the Army Air Corps. Then you finally drove up in a car- Gee, it was a funny dream. It was much more complicated than that but it wouldn’t <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> You looked so cute, though. Woody and I are going to see “National Velvet” tonight. It’s supposed to be good. As long as it’s about a horse I’m sure to like it. That reminds me, honey, we should go riding sometime. Maybe when we’re old and gray someday we’ll go. Oh, honey, don’t you want to send any announcements to Steve or any of the fellows in the Air Corps. We’ll have loads of them so don’t worry about that. Golly, you only get married once on March 11 th. We’re having a couple hundred made so we have to use them up. What a wedding this is going to be! Nothing has gone the way we planned! You’ve changed your bestman + I’ve changed my attendants and the place has been changed. That’s what I like- everything goes exactly the opposite from the way we plan. Wonder if that will happen all our lives. Hope so- I love things to happen. Are you {{going to be able to}} get the rings this weekend, honey? Or aren’t they giving you open Post? This week went real fast for me- The weekends always do anyway. Oh honey, are you going to have our rings engraved there? Let me know about your ring so I can send you the money, hon. You most certainly didn’t answer my questions about Scotch! (Not until this letter). You didn’t tell me how much to get. I’ll get more than one bottle, honey. One bottle will never last you until we get out of the south. Someone is playing “I’m Beginning To See The Light”. Hope I can remember to buy some ink, honey, this stuff is getting lighter and lighter. Gee, honey, only 16 more days. You’ll probably be getting your rings about now. Hope it’s a nice day but I probably wouldn’t know the difference. Gee, honey, it won’t be much longer now. You’re just too wonderful, honey! You’re just too, too wonderful. I wish I could be with you now. I miss you more + more every day. The sun just came out. Happy Day! It still looks like a storm. I love you so- Well, honey, just got back from “National Velvet”. It was wonderful. What a picture. I love horses- Woody + I went and I’ve almost got her talked into going riding. Gee, I love you honey. Someday maybe we’ll go riding together. Tomorrow I may go if it’s nice out and not too cold- Woody’s never been and I’m trying to get her to go. Gee, darling, I miss you so. I wish we were going to be married now instead of in sixteen more days. Well, honey it’s pretty late. Guess I better get to bed. I’ll write tomorrow, my darling, I miss you more and more. And they’ll never be words enough to tell you how very much I love you. Do you know Carol’s sister? She had a baby boy the other day. Her husband was killed in France the first day he went into action- the only thing that kept her going was the baby. She was praying so that it would be a boy. Carol is real busy now being an Aunt. Well, honey, as I said before I’d better be getting. I love you and will love you Always, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|E
40|$|Transcription begins]: Sunday My darling Judson, Honey, I adore you so. Golly, honey, I {{miss you}} so much. The only thought that I have to cheer me up {{is that at}} the end of the ten weeks we’ll be married. Darling, I have so many things to be {{grateful}} to you for. Your love, sweetness, kindness and understanding has completely changed me. Until this last week, marriage to me was a kind of dark shadow. Something that every woman had to go through 2 ̆ 6 tolerate. Can you imagine how awful that was. You probably can’t. I was so happy being in love with you but always in the back of my mind was that awful fear 2 ̆ 6 doubt. Now that’s all gone. I am so relieved 2 ̆ 6 happy now. Honey, I’m so glad that I’m in love with you. Another thing I’m thankful for is this last week. What a difference a week can make. Without that lord only knows what would have happened. Well, you’re at Spence Field now. I hope it’s a good field and that you’ll like it. What time did you get there? You weren’t late were you, honey? Sure hope not. That hospital was some place. Honestly, honey, those nurses were a bunch of absolute morons. They kept giving me ice bags that leaked 2 ̆ 6 they’d forget that they had leaked 2 ̆ 6 leave me for three quarters of an hour with a wet gown (hah, that’s a laugh—those pityful [sic] things they call gowns—Bags—probably burlap at that). I could just feel myself catching cold. This morning, (I’d just gotten to sleep at about six thirty) at the ungodly hour five o’clock one of the morons came in to wake me up—she took my temperature 2 ̆ 6 pulse. Then the parade began. You’d think I was giving away free lunch or something. Had a glass of milk for breakfast 2 ̆ 6 one for lunch. Also managed some pudding 2 ̆ 6 potatoes for lunch. Darling, I love you so. I can’t think of anything except how very much I love you, honey. You are to me everything I love. While we were at the hospital waiting to go home they played “Don’t Fence Me In. ” Gee, I love you so. That song brings back so many memories. I love you so. All the way home I kept seeing things that reminded me of you. We drove down a few streets in Brooklyn that you 2 ̆ 6 I had when we were lost. Then Daddy turned down a street. Remember how we went down the one way street, the wrong way, where the police car stopped us in New York? Daddy went down the same street the wrong way. Gee, honey, I love you so. Then we drove on that highway that you 2 ̆ 6 I always go to New York on. Gee, honey, so many things remind me of you. Golly, Judd, I’ve really got it bad. Honestly, I never knew I could love anyone the way I love you. Golly—Everytime I see you or just hear your voice I love you more. Golly, Sweetheart, it really will be something when we’re married. We really won’t have a friend left. Tonight’s New Year’s Eve. Gee, it would be marvelous to be with you. In the condition I’m in it wouldn’t be so nice but I do love you so. Wasn’t supposed to come home until tomorrow or later but I hate to stay in a hospital. What a way to spend New Year’s Eve. Wonder what you’re doing now honey? It’s six o’clock. Oh, is your time there different from the time here? I hope not. Cause when I’m trying to imagine what you’re doing at a certain time, you won’t be doing it then. Oh, honey, I love you so. Happy New Year, my darling. What a year this has been. Never dreamed when it started that I’d be engaged before the year was over. Honey, I’d better rest for a while. That doctor told me to rest a lot. Well, darling, I’ll write more later. I love you more than anything else in the world. Whatever you do, honey, remember I love you. Please don’t forget to write whenever you can. I love you so. I always think of you 2 ̆ 6 miss you loads. Monday Hello darling— This is sort of a continued story. What a life. My throat is really sore again today. Can’t even talk. Yesterday your mother 2 ̆ 6 Bobbie came down for a few minutes. Must have talked too much then or something because my throat feels as though there was a lump of something there so that I can’t say a word. In a way it’s nice not to be able to talk. Don’t have to listen to what anyone else is saying 2 ̆ 6 can just sit there and day dream about you—But, golly, I keep thinking of the funniest things I’d like to say. Gee, honey, I miss you so. You are so wonderful to be in love with—I’m so glad that you’re the one I’m going to marry. You’ll be the most wonderful person in the whole world. I love you so, Sweetheart. Oh, remember when Daddy announced our engagement 2 ̆ 6 Ronnie wanted to know if that made him a grandfather now? Well, Mother called Sis 2 ̆ 6 Walter (his mother 2 ̆ 6 father) and said that I was in the hospital. Ronnie must have been listening or something because he asked “Is Dottie in the hospital to have a baby. ” He really is rushing things. Honey, I love you so. It’s really pityful [sic]. No matter what I’m doing I think of you constantly. Happy New Year, darling—I hope that next New Year’s Eve we will be together. Golly, honey, we’ll be married then. Honey, please try to get a lot of rest 2 ̆ 6 sleep during these next ten weeks. Don’t lose any more weight. You’ll have to take care of yourself. Someone has to be healthy in our family. Harry James is playing, “I’m Beginning To See The Light. ” I like it. Just played “Stareyes. ” That’s a good song too. Gee, honey, there are so many things I’d like to say to you. Try to tell you how much I love you and miss you but there aren’t enough words, I guess. Hope that you can read this but I’m lying down 2 ̆ 6 it’s some angle to write from. Honey, I wonder if I’ll ever be sure of you. I can’t explain how I feel 2 ̆ 6 I’ll probably say the wrong thing 2 ̆ 6 give you the wrong impression—But, I just can’t believe that you love me. It’s too good to be true. It just doesn’t seem possible—was thinking about it last night for the longest time and should have written it then when my thoughts were clear. You’re going to be getting terribly conceited but, honey, you’re just perfect—I can’t find one thing that I don’t like about you. Physically you’re perfect. You’re good looking 2 ̆ 6 tall 2 ̆ 6 dark 2 ̆ 6 have beautiful eyes and curley [sic] hair. You’re nice 2 ̆ 6 strong. Mentally you’re perfect, too. You’ve got ability—talent and loads of brains 2 ̆ 6 you’ve got good sense (most of the time, except when you try to be practical at the wrong times). You have knowledge 2 ̆ 6 can use it when the need arises. You can do just about anything you put your mind to. Besides that you have a marvelous sense of humor. You’re sweet 2 ̆ 6 thoughtful and I love you. Better stop telling you how wonderful you are or there’ll be no living with you. Golly, hon, this time last week, we were eating dinner here. We didn’t want to go to Brooklyn. Golly, suppose we hadn’t gone. Things might have been so different. I don’t know about you but this week made a lot of difference to me. They’re playing “I’m Making Believe. ” That’s what I’ll be doing until you come home. How is this field? Hope it’s nice. Honey, I don’t see how these ten weeks will go fast but everyone seems convinced that they will. To me they’ll seem more like ten years. When do you start flying? What a day. It’s pouring 2 ̆ 6 the wind is blowing. Glad that you’re not at Stewart now. The weather will probably be awful. The doctor said I couldn’t go out for two weeks. Phooey. It will be horrible lying around for two weeks but good for my ankle. Mother wants me to go see Conover 2 ̆ 6 do photography instead of going back to wholesale. Can’t decide whether to do that or not. Honey, gee, you can’t imagine how lonesome it is around here without you. I’d love to have you home just for a few hours so that I could hear your voice, hear you laugh 2 ̆ 6 say “I love you. ” There are so many little things I love about you. Honey, they’re playing “Together. ” All day they’ve been playing all our songs. Especially “Don’t Fence Me In. ” Memories are wonderful things. We were really lucky to have so much time together, hon. Do you get every weekend off? Are you restricted or anything for the first two or three weeks? How was the train trip down? Do you have any Scotch left or am I kidding? I’ve written you two letters so far 2 ̆ 6 will keep them until I hear from you because they’re so long. I’d hate to have anything happen to them before you read them. Finished reading Mrs. Parkington today. She had a pretty good life. It was a very good story. It took me ages to read it because I kept thinking about you. The nurse was going to make me take my ring 2 ̆ 6 bracelet off but I explained I couldn’t 2 ̆ 6 she was very nice 2 ̆ 6 said it would be o. k. to leave them on. Had me worried for a minute though. Have my tonsils in a jar on my dressing table. They were awful the doctor said. Now I’ll probably be o. k. He said they had so much pus in them that they were breaking 2 ̆ 6 going through my system. Well, from now on I should be the picture of health. Honey, have you gotten in touch with Steve yet? Woody is madly waiting for a letter from him. I have been dying to have a long talk with her ever since you told me what happened to see if she is any different. Now I’ll be looking for her to say something while before I wasn’t. The only trouble is that I can’t talk. It’s awful—wonder if she’ll tell me. I doubt it. I’m sure if I had I wouldn’t go around telling anyone. I’ll tell you if anything happens. She’ll probably have to tell someone. Most people do. Honey, the luggage is so beautiful. I’m crazy about it. Gee, I love it. Honestly, honey, I was so surprised. You can’t imagine. The bracelet surprised me too. I wish that I could have surprised you but I knew you wanted the old pen 2 ̆ 6 pencil set. That’s so unromantic, honey. I’m dying to go downstairs 2 ̆ 6 sit 2 ̆ 6 look at my Christmas presents. I really haven’t seen most of them. When I first came in they were what I saw. Your luggage. Honestly, honey, I’m crazy about them. Bobbie just called 2 ̆ 6 yesterday she took home the monkey I got for Ricky. She said it looked like you 2 ̆ 6 was calling it Willy—I’ll have to murder her. Bobbie said if I don’t stop writing this letter I’ll have to send it railway express. Grandmaw said I shouldn’t give the monkey to Ricky because it would scare him—I thought he was cute. You can decide whether to be insulted or flattered when you see “Willy. ” Oh, if anyone down there calls you Bill or any other name that comes from William tell them they’ll have a battle on their hands when I get down there. Judson is such a nice name—I’ve always liked that name—ever since I first met you. I really should end this soon because it will be getting too big for an envelope. Honey, I love you so. Every day I was with you made me love you so much more. How long can this go on[?] Every weekend I was sure that I couldn’t love you any more 2 ̆ 6 yet every weekend I did love you more. That last week was wonderful. It was heaven to be with you so much. Almost as though we were married. We certainly weren’t apart for long. It was wonderful. Honey, how do you feel towards Mickey now? You know me well enough to know that I’m not asking out of jealousy. But when you thought you saw her you looked so strange I didn’t quite know how to interpret that look. Golly, I kept thinking today was Sunday 2 ̆ 6 it’s Monday. We were asleep before I guess. Remember? We were out at the base now. Sinatra’s singing “Night and Day. ” It’s so true. I think of you Night 2 ̆ 6 Day. Honey, I love you so. I’ll never be able to tell you how much. You have such a wonderful way of saying what I mean. Does that <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> But you do. You say what I want to but [can’t] find words for. Now he’s singing “Saturday Night Is the Loniest [sic] Night In the Week. ” Ah, yes. Hope you can read this. I’m just writing whatever comes into my mind 2 ̆ 6 it probably won’t make much sense. I love you. Honey, we won’t ever fall out of love will we, honey? That’s another thing that has worried me. After we’ve been married for a few—(oh, honey, he’s singing “If You Are But a Dream”). (Oh, honey, that’s the first time I’ve heard it since you left. Darling I love you so and miss you terribly. Honey, I hope these ten weeks hurry.) To get back to what I was writing, years to become indifferent to each other 2 ̆ 6 not be in love any more. It won’t happen to us will it, honey? Well, darling—Frankie’s singing “I Dream of You. ” I do—“And I Want You So More than You’ll ever know. ” Hope you like “East Jesus. ” I love you so. Have you started flying yet? What’s it like there? Hope you like it. I love you so. Please write as often as possible. I’ll try to write every day. Probably the rest of my letters won’t be this long, but I’ll try to keep them as long as possible. I love you more than anything else in the world. Goodnight, Sweetheart. I love you. You have all my love forever 2 ̆ 6 always. Dottie P. S. I love you— [Transcription ends...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: By {{the end of}} the 20 th century, {{culture and}} {{cultural}} identity became key elements in ethno-political conflicts. In traditional scholarship the origins of conflicts were located in the unequal distribution of wealth, unequal access to resources, status and power. The roots of ethnic violence and acts of terrorism, however, can only partly be explained in terms of external conditions. Traditional theories have neglected the importance of culture for human existence and threat towards cultural identity in ethnic conflicts. The major premise of my talk is the assumption that culture is more than a system of shared meaning and practices. Rather, as pointed out by the German sociologist Max Weber, culture provides meaning and importance to our lives in an otherwise meaningless universe. According to new theorizing in social psychology, the main function of culture is to alleviate anxiety caused by the awareness of our eventual death. In this framework, culture and religion offer answers to the meaning of life in the face of our mortality. Faith in ones own cultural world-view provides protection from the fear of death. If people feel that their religion or other cultural world-views are threatened by other religions or conceptions of culture they can be mobilized and seem to be ready to fight or even die for their beliefs. You may be wondering about the title of this little essay. Perhaps the connection of the first two concepts- “culture ” and “conflict ”- <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> The third concept-“death ”-in connection with “culture ” may surprise you. In the following I will focus on the intricate relationship between culture and death. By this, I refer to new theoretical developments in psychology known as “Terror Management Theory ” that elucidates the relationship between culture and death. First, I shall speak about the traditional understanding of culture and how culture became a key element in current ethno-political conflicts. I shall argue that the dynamics of these conflicts cannot be understood without the role that culture plays in our attempts to understand the meaning of our lives and death...|$|R

40|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{writing about}} death {{have adopted a}} strikingly cheery and optimistic tone. Their goal has been to show us that, though we may lack immortal souls, we should still regard the oblivion hurtling toward us with a calm and steady eye. Some of these philosophers have tried to convince us that nonexistence is not so dreadful a thing. The Epicureans invoked a variety of ingenious arguments to this conclusion, the most famous being this: it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> fear death {{only if it is}} bad for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be dead. But it is not bad for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be dead. Your death is the end of you. After the event there is no <b>you</b> for things <b>to</b> be good or bad for. More recently, Bernard Williams (in “The Makropulos Case: Reflections on the Tedium of Immortality,” in Problems of the Self [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1973]) had a more nuanced argument: a finite life is not so bad when you consider the alternative, an infinite life. An infinite life either would become tedious to the point of having no value, or would involve so much psychological change that the vibrant existence of later incarnations of the infinite being would not satisfy any desire to survive on the part of earlier incarnations of the infinite being...|$|R
40|$|The Violence of Final Words Philosophy in the Margins of Healthcare Ethics Healthcare ethics {{struggles with}} status. Ever since its birth, {{it has been}} troubled by family quarrels over {{universality}} and particularity, theoretical knowledge and practical reasoning, pragmatics and philosophical insight, principles and virtues, technics and hermeneutics, liberalism and communitarianism, in short, over ‘narrow’ and ‘broad’ notions of morality. Although these philosophical controversies are discussed in its margins, healthcare ethics is deeply affected by their contrapositions. Indeed, anyone involved in it today inevitably takes a side. 	This study begins by demonstrating the antagonist’s positions but, as it carries on, withdraws from them, favouring neither and not attempting to reconcile them. On the contrary, it shows {{the way in which}} they complete each other and act on the same grounds. Both ignore the violence of final words, although it is already active in either of their arguments. Because of that ignorance, they underestimate the value and function proper to the political (H. Arendt). 	Final words (Rorty’s final vocabulary) impress upon us. Hence their violence is not simply a verbal one with which debates carry on or are interrupted. Rather it is non- or pre-verbal, lending us occasion to hear or (morally) appreciate something, but not without restraint. We cannot hear everything, and even if we were (technically) able to do so, what we would hear then is not anything. What we hear is always something that <b>makes</b> <b>sense,</b> or not. Therefore, even if we (technically) hear the same thing, what we hear in it, is not unquestionably the same. Furthermore, what <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and <b>to</b> me is not just a finite or distorted interpretation of a pre-given universal meaning. What <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> has meaning, for which we have nothing but final words. 	Our final words are those ‘last’ words we employ to justify our actions, our beliefs, and our lives, but be unable to justify them. Indeed, behind these words it stays still. This means that an unfamiliar silence, a mute ‘something’, a foreign intimacy (Lacan’s extimité), a dumb resident (Lyotard’s infans) or an inaccessible, inner deafness dwells in us. It singularizes us and holds us in a grip. 	We stick on ‘something’ we are unable to hear. Final words hide and protect this unfamiliar deafness. While these words belong to our family, our family belongs to that deafness instead. For that reason, we cannot give up our final words, without giving up something of ourselves. They are vulnerable, and so we are through them. We want them to be taken seriously and urge for their recognition. 	We are occupied by ‘something’ that would crush us if we were left with it in private. The open air of the political sphere offers us the possibility to transform it and give it a public shape. Though politics cannot assure the recognition we are longing for (indeed, others, because of their peculiar deafness, cannot hear what we hear in our final words), its ‘public-ness’ allows us yet to speak of what we have at heart. 	Liberal and communitarian public spheres are particular responses to the political and to the problem of recognition. In order to keep us undisturbed, liberalism restricts the open air. Its remedy for the violence of final words is to rip them of out the public sphere, and to banish them to the private realms. Communitarians broaden the private sphere and comfort us in confirming our final words, but fall short of the recognition we actually desire. Stretching the liberal I into a private we, it fills in a gap through common identification. However, as soon as we doubt the worth of what we consider worthwhile, it cannot fill what we are always longing for. What we desire then, is the recognition of our values, in particular from those others who are not able to recognize them. In the course of this aporia, which sustains that desire, the political cultivates (moral) conflicts that ask for a decision. 	Healthcare ethics is mixed up with this question. Consequently, it is politically structured by way of recognition and decision. As is shown in this study, whether one applies a small (liberal) or a broad (communitarian) notion of morality in facing a moral problem, at either side one is focussed on the solution – the former more directly than the latter. That focus, however, comes too soon. For the characteristics of the political, healthcare ethics – as a public affair – is more than just a family matter, on the other hand it must also acquire more than just a pragmatic function. Hence, taking our urge for recognition seriously, a (moral) decision obtains another meaning. In this way healthcare ethics is philosophically diagnosed. This book examines the mutual relationships between philosophy, technology, ethics and politics. With Hannah Arendt (and M. Heidegger), the affiliation of technical thinking and philosophy is discussed in chapter 1. It underlines the way in which philosophy helped lay the foundations of technical thinking. As a result, philosophy and technics occupy a specific position in relation to the political. Chapter 2 takes a closer look at the characteristics of technical thinking in an effort to clarify what exactly is at stake in healthcare ethics as ‘human affair’. A technically approached ethics is unable to give room to moral qualities such as involvement, confidence and obligation, even though it presupposes them. Such ethics does not get beyond the question ‘what should we do?’, which is viewed and answered as a technical question. Chapter 3 focuses on the dominant approach in healthcare ethics, more particularly the principle approach, which, due to its specific and poor vocabulary, has a hard time voicing the said moral qualities. This is demonstrated by means of a case study. Principlism ties in with a technical view and a procedural approach of decision-making. A few models, illustrating this way in which action-guides are formulated, are commented upon in chapter 4. 	Chapter 5 reports on the Dutch debate between Th. van Willigenburg (an engineer) and P. van Tongeren (a philosopher). The philosopher will argue that we must take a step back and reflect on the technical approach, which forgets its own presuppositions. The two may be stuck in a battle of oppositions, their stands, however – and for that very reason – also complement each other. This conclusion touches also that other, and better-known, debate between liberals and communitarians. In chapter 6 the philosophical criticism is scrutinized in detail. Having taken a step backwards, it immediately takes another one forward. The problem is that this step is made too hastily, is forgetful and manifests an irony that neglects decision-making. Instead of taking a step forward, a second step should be taken back in an effort to actually think the ‘decision’. 	That second step is taken in chapter 7. First a case is thoroughly analysed and discussed to lay bare the ‘deafness’ that typifies ethical discussions. Whence the conclusion that, in this ‘deaf-men talk’, in absence of either fitting or fusing ‘singular grounds’, one way or another a decision will have to be made. Further, in the wake of the ethical discussion, the very function and meaning of the political and the decision are looked at. In the end, the public sphere is indeed – sui generis – the very space in which the violence of final words can somehow be deafened; decisions, if democratically embedded, may perform this – not unlike rituals do. nrpages: 399 status: publishe...|$|R
