In a comparison of genotoxic effects of MRI compared with those of CT scans, the cancer risk of MRI is unknown.

5000|$|This is {{a branch}} of {{medicine}} that uses radiation {{to provide information about}} the functioning of a person's specific organs or to treat disease. In most cases, the information is used by physicians to make a quick, accurate diagnosis of the patient's illness. The thyroid, bones, heart, liver and many other organs can be easily imaged, and disorders in their function revealed. In some cases radiation can be used to treat diseased organs, or tumours. Five Nobel Laureates have been intimately involved with the use of radioactive tracers in medicine.Over 10,000 hospitals worldwide use radioisotopes in medicine, and about 90% of the procedures are for diagnosis. The most common radioisotope used in diagnosis is technetium-99, with some 30 million procedures per year, accounting for 80% of all nuclear medicine procedures worldwide.In developed countries (26% of world population) the frequency of diagnostic nuclear medicine is 1.9% per year, and the frequency of therapy with radioisotopes is about one tenth of this. In the USA there are some 18 million nuclear medicine procedures per year among 311 million people, and in Europe about 10 million among 500 million people. In Australia there are about 560,000 per year among 21 million people, 470,000 of these using reactor isotopes. The use of radiopharmaceuticals in diagnosis is growing at over 10% per year.Nuclear medicine was developed in the 1950s by physicians with an endocrine emphasis, initially using iodine-131 to diagnose and then treat thyroid disease. In recent years, specialists have also come from radiology, as dual CT/PET procedures have become established.Computed X-ray tomography (CT) scans and nuclear medicine contribute 36% of the total radiation exposure and 75% of the <b>medical</b> <b>exposure</b> to the US population, according to a US National Council on Radiation Protection & Measurements report in 2009.

While high-dose radiation, regardless of source or intention, is harmful to health, evidence is presented that chronic doses up to 100 times those of normal ambient (including <b>medical)</b> <b>exposures</b> are beneficial, mainly due to lower cancer rates. Further evidence is presented that single, acute doses of up to 50 rad are beneficial, including in treatment of cancer and gangrene. Data are cited to show that below-ambient radiation levels are unhealthful, and that some radiation may be essential for many life-forms...|$|R

40|$|The goal. The {{analyses}} of radiation hygienic monitoring conducted in Tula region territories {{affected by the}} Chernobyl NPP accident regarding cesium- 137 and strontium- 90 in the local foodstuffs and the {{analyses of}} populational annual effective dose. The materials and methods. The survey was conducted in Tula Region since 1997 to 2015. Over that period, more than fifty thousand samples of the main foodstuffs from the post-Chernobyl contaminated area were analyzed. Simultaneously with that, the external gamma - radiation dose rate was measured in the fixed control points. The dynamics of cesium - 137 and strontium- 90 content in foodstuffs were assessed along with the maximum values of the mean annual effective doses to the population and {{the contribution of the}} collective dose from <b>medical</b> <b>exposures</b> into the structure of the annual effective collective dose to the population. The results. The amount of cesium- 137 and strontium - 90 in the local foodstuffs was identified. The external gamma- radiation dose rate values were found to be stable and not exceeding the natural fluctuations range typical for the middle latitudes of Russia’s European territory. The maximum mean annual effective dose to the population reflects the stable radiation situation and does not exceed the permissible value of 1 mSv. The contribution of the collective dose from <b>medical</b> <b>exposures</b> of the population has been continuously reducing as well as the average individual dose to the population per one medical treatment under the annual increase of the medical treatments quantities. The conclusion. There is no exceedance of the admissible levels of cesium- 137 and strontium- 90 content in the local foodstuffs. The mean annual effective dose to the population has decreased which makes it possible to transfer the settlements affected by the Chernobyl NPP accident to normal life style.
