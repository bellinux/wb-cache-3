5|$|Excluding these, {{surprisingly}} few documents {{dating to}} Unas' reign have survived to this day, considering the 30-year length that later records give for his reign. Excavations at Abusir, the royal necropolis of the Fifth Dynasty, have produced only four dated inscriptions safely attributable to Unas. They explicitly <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> third, fourth, sixth and eighth {{years on the}} throne. Unas also left a rock inscription {{on the island of}} Elephantine, next to the First Cataract of the Nile in Nubia.|$|E
5|$|Set {{before the}} events of Thor, Phil Coulson stops {{at a gas station}} on his way to Albuquerque, New Mexico. While Coulson shops for snacks {{in the back of the}} station, two robbers enter and demand the money from the register. When the robbers ask whose car is outside, Coulson reveals himself, {{surrender}}s his keys, and offers to surrender his pistol as well. As he is about to turn over the gun, Coulson distracts the robbers and subdues both men in seconds. He then nonchalantly pays for his snacks while subtly advising the clerk not to <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> involvement to the police and leaves the station.|$|E
5|$|The legend {{strongly}} {{emphasizes that}} Henry was a Bishop of Uppsala, not a Bishop of Finland {{which became a}} conventional claim later on, also by the church itself. He stayed in Finland out of pity, but was never appointed as a bishop there. The legend does not state whether there had been bishops in Finland before his time or what happened after his death; it does not even <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> burial in Finland. The vita is so void of any concrete information about Finland {{that it could have}} been created anywhere. The Latin is scholastic and the grammar is in general exceptionally good.|$|E

5|$|During his {{successful}} {{campaign for the}} U.S. presidency, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to pursue a more proactive anti-communist policy, promising to roll back communism, rather than contain it. Working {{in an atmosphere of}} increasing McCarthyism in government circles, Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use the CIA to depose governments the U.S. disliked. Although PBFORTUNE had been quickly aborted, tension between the U.S. and Guatemala continued to rise, especially with the legalization of the communist PGT, and its inclusion in the government coalition for the elections of January 1953. Articles published in the U.S. press often reflected this predisposition to see communist influence; for example, a New York Times article about the visit to Guatemala by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda highlighted his communist beliefs, but neglected to <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> reputation as the greatest living poet in Latin America.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{candidates}} {{to host the}} program included Soupy Sales, host of children's variety shows in the 1950s and 1960s, and comedian Dana Carvey. After Nickelodeon determined Sales to be too old for the role, and Carvey was offered a chance to audition for Saturday Night Live, {{the search for a}} host continued. Producers viewed over 1,000 applicants from Los Angeles and New York. First attending a tryout in lieu of a friend, and later passing multiple auditions, television warm-up comedian Marc Summers was one of two finalists advancing to a final audition. Each hosted a mock game for Nickelodeon to make an ultimate decision on who would host Double Dare. The producers felt the way Summers ended the game by leading into a commercial break was more professional and he was hired for the position {{in the first week of}} September 1986. Because focus groups showed that the audience thought he was more than 10 years younger than he actually was, Summers was obligated by Nickelodeon for years to not <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> age publicly.|$|E
5|$|Irataba (Mohave: eecheeyara tav , {{also known}} as Yara tav, Yarate:va, Arateve; â€“ 1874) was {{a leader of the}} Mohave Nation, known for his role as a {{mediator}} between his people and the United States. He was born near the Colorado River in present-day Arizona. Irataba was a renowned orator {{and one of the first}} Mohave to speak English, a skill he used to develop relations with the United States. Early records <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> large physical size and gentle demeanor. Irataba first encountered European Americans in 1851, when he assisted the Sitgreaves Expedition. In 1854, he met Amiel Whipple, then leading an expedition crossing the Colorado. Several Mohave aided the group, and Irataba agreed to escort them through the territory of the Paiute to the Old Spanish Trail, which would take them to southern California. He later helped and protected other expeditions, earning him a reputation among whites as the most important native leader in the region.|$|E

5|$|Remaining at Rhodes {{during the}} 1940 {{academic}} year, Smith secretly {{made plans to}} leave for military service {{in spite of his}} instructions to finish studying. In June 1940, during the mid-year break from studies, he quietly travelled to the Southern Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, to tell the colony's director of manpower, William Addison, that he wanted to join the air force; to avoid being barred from enlistment, Smith did not <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> university attendance, and gave his Selukwe address. During his Christmas vacation at the end of 1940, Smith went to Salisbury again, and was successful in a second interview with an air force official and a physical examination. Early in 1941, having received his pilot course call-up papers, Smith underwent a final interview, during which it emerged that he was a university student; the interviewer briefly demurred, but accepted Smith when he insisted that he wanted to sign up.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sources for}} Urse's life are English {{documents}} such as charters and writs which <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> activities. Often these {{are contained in}} collections of such documents, known as cartularies, which were assembled by monasteries and cathedral chapters to document their landholdings. Cartularies frequently contain documents from landholders surrounding a monastery, which {{is the case with}} many of the documents mentioning Urse. Other sources of information on Urse are Domesday Book, which mentions his landholdings in 1086, and a number of chronicles, including William of Malmesbury's Gesta pontificum Anglorum, Florence of Worcester's Chronicon ex chronicis, and Hemming's Cartulary, a mixed chronicle and cartulary from Worcester Cathedral. There are also mentions of Urse in Norman sources, such as charters for Saint-Georges de Boscherville Abbey.|$|E
5|$|The scouts were {{pursued by}} the disorganized militia and several were killed. The {{surviving}} scouts arrived at Black Hawk's camp ahead of the militia and reported the events. At the camp, the warriors set up a skirmish line in order {{to fend off the}} pending militia attack. The militia soldiers, intent on pursuing the scouts, chased them back toward the main force of Black Hawk's warriors and their skirmish line. Black Hawk and his force concealed themselves and ambushed the pursuers. Believing that thousands of Sauk and Fox were attacking them, the militia panicked and fled back to the main force camped at Dixon's Ferry. Stillman's exact whereabouts are unknown during this point in the battle. His later account published in a newspaper did not <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> location and noted his only order was to retreat. Stillman's account, published in the Missouri Republican, has been called fanciful.|$|E

5|$|The {{day after}} Umbricht's death, the Colts decided to honor their {{teammate}} by wearing black armbands {{for the entire}} 1964 season. Umbricht's uniform number (32) was immediately retired by the team; {{it was the first}} time the club retired a uniform number, and only the ninth time in Major League history a number was retired. In the Colts' opening-day match against the Cincinnati Reds, starting pitcher Ken Johnson dedicated his victory in Umbricht's memory. The Astros' MVP award was also named in his honor. The back of Umbricht's 1964 Topps baseball card was updated to <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> death shortly before printing. The retirement of Umbricht's number received some criticism, however. Former teammate Jimmy Wynn wrote in his autobiography that Walt Bond, a former Astros player who was African-American, died from leukemia while he was still active. His jersey number was not retired by the club after his death, although he appeared in more games for the Astros than Umbricht. (It should be noted, however, that Bond ended his career not with Houston but as a member of the Minnesota Twins.) Journalists criticizing the retirement of numbers sometimes use Umbricht as an example of someone whose number was retired but who is unfamiliar to baseball fans.|$|E
