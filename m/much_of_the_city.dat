5|$|Following the Fire, the {{thoroughfares}} of Queen Street and King Street were newly laid out, {{cutting across}} more ancient thoroughfares in the City, {{creating a new}} route up from the Thames to the Guildhall; {{they were the only}} notable new streets following the fire's destruction of <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>City.</b>|$|E
5|$|Further inland, {{moisture}} from Bonnie {{combined with a}} cold front to produce widespread thunderstorms over Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee. In Arkansas, lightning from a severe thunderstorm knocked out power to <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Rison after striking a transformer. Significant wind damage took place in Dallas County where awnings were blown off homes, structures sustained roof damage, and trees were felled. Heavy rains also triggered localized flash flooding, covering several highways. Throughout the state, storm damage was estimated at $356,000 (2010USD).|$|E
5|$|In 1900 {{a massive}} {{hurricane}} struck Galveston, destroying <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> That and another storm in 1915 shifted {{much of the}} focus from investors away from Galveston and toward nearby Houston, which {{was seen as a}} safer location for commercial operations. Because of these events, the coming oil boom became heavily centered on the city of Houston both as a port and a commercial center.|$|E

5|$|Licori and Armida were Monteverdi's final {{theatrical}} {{works for}} the Mantuan court. Vincenzo II's death ended the main Gonzaga line; the dukedom was inherited by a distant relative, Charles of Nevers, and Mantua was subsequently engulfed {{in a series of}} conflicts, which by 1630 had reduced <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> to ruins. Monteverdi's last known letter to Striggio is dated 8 July 1628; Striggio died in Venice on 8 June 1630, while heading a mission requesting aid against the armies that were encircling Mantua.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 1986, the Oklahoma State Transportation Commission (which had {{replaced}} the Highway Commission) approved rerouting US-60/SH-11 {{on the east side}} of Pawhuska. While the two highways still passed through Pawhuska from west to east, after turning north, the new route bypassed <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> The application for this alteration was submitted to AASHTO on September 22, received the same day, and approved on November 8.|$|E
5|$|On November 4, Election Day for Indianapolis {{political}} offices, {{bands of}} pro-union men roved {{the city and}} vandalized property, burnt streetcars, harassed public officials, and effectively shut down <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> in the worst violence of the strike. Sheriff Porttens again ordered the police to protect the streetcars, but another twenty-nine officers resigned; because the force was so short on men, the sheriff refused their resignation {{and put them on}} other duties.|$|E

5|$|Pinellas County lies on a {{peninsula}} between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, and <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Tampa lies on {{a smaller}} peninsula jutting out into Tampa Bay. This proximity to large bodies of water both moderates temperatures and introduces large amounts of humidity into the atmosphere. In general, the local communities farthest from the coast have larger temperature ranges, both during a single day and throughout the seasons of the year.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Netherlands {{commenced}} on 10 May 1940. While initial {{air operations}} went well, and the German fighters and bombers soon gained {{the upper hand}} against the small Dutch air force, the paratroopers ran into fierce opposition in the Battle for The Hague and the Battle of Rotterdam. On 14 May 1940, responding to a call for assistance from Student, Kesselring ordered the bombing of Rotterdam city centre. Fires raged out of control, destroying <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b>|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{landmark in}} Fleet Street {{during the late}} Middle Ages was a conduit {{that was the main}} water supply for the area. When Anne Boleyn was crowned Queen following her marriage to Henry VIII in 1533, the conduit flowed wine instead of water. By the 16th century, Fleet Street, along with <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>City,</b> was chronically overcrowded, and a Royal proclamation in 1580 banned any further building on the street. This had little effect, and construction continued, particularly timber. Prince Henry's Room over the Inner Temple gate dates from 1610 and is named after Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, eldest son of James I, who did not survive to succeed his father.|$|E
5|$|Due to the threat, the {{government}} of Honduras evacuated some of the 45,000 citizens on the Bay Islands and prepared all air and naval resources. The government of Belize issued a purple alert and asked for citizens on offshore islands {{to leave for the}} mainland. Because the hurricane threatened to strike near Belize City as a Category4 hurricane, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was evacuated in fear of a repeat of Hurricane Hattie 37years earlier. Guatemala issued a purple alert as well, recommending boats to stay in port, telling people to prepare or seek shelter, and warning of potential overflowing rivers. By the time hurricane Mitch made landfall, numerous people were evacuated along the western Caribbean coastline, including 100,000 in Honduras, 10,000 in Guatemala, and 20,000 in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Devonport was the {{headquarters}} of Western Approaches Command until 1941, and Sunderland flying boats were operated by the Royal Australian Air Force. It was an important embarkation point for US troops for D-Day. The city was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe, {{in a series of}} 59 raids known as the Plymouth Blitz. Although the dockyards were the principal targets, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> centre and over 3,700 houses were completely destroyed and more than 1,000 civilians lost their lives. This was largely due to Plymouth's status as a major port. Charles Church was hit by incendiary bombs and partially destroyed in 1941 during the Blitz, but has not been demolished. It has been designated as an official permanent monument to the bombing of Plymouth during World War II.|$|E

5|$|Following World War I, the British {{upper class}} was in decline as the reduced {{workforce}} meant servants were less in supply and demanded higher salaries. The grandest houses in Mayfair became {{more expensive to}} service and consequently many were converted to foreign embassies. The 2nd Duke of Westminster decided to demolish Grosvenor House and build Bourdon House in its place. Mayfair attracted commercial development after <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> of London was destroyed during the Blitz, and many corporate headquarters were established in the area. Several historically important houses were demolished, including Aldford House, Londonderry House and Chesterfield House.|$|E
5|$|Plague cases {{continued}} to occur sporadically at a modest rate until {{the summer of}} 1666. On {{the second and third}} of September that year, the Great Fire of London destroyed <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> of London, and some people believed that the fire {{put an end to the}} epidemic. However, it is now thought that the plague had largely subsided before the fire took place. In fact, most of the later cases of plague were found in the suburbs, and it was the City of London itself that was destroyed by the Fire.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Aachen {{was a major}} combat {{action of}} World War II, fought by American and German forces in and around Aachen, Germany, between 12 September–21 October 1944. The city had been {{incorporated}} into the Siegfried Line, the main defensive network on Germany's western border; the Allies had hoped to capture it quickly and advance into the industrialized Ruhr Basin. Although most of Aachen's civilian population was evacuated before the battle began, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was destroyed and both sides suffered heavy losses. It {{was one of the}} largest urban battles fought by U.S. forces in World War II, and the first city on German soil to be captured by the Allies. The battle ended with a German surrender, but their tenacious defense significantly disrupted Allied plans for the advance into Germany.|$|E

5|$|The Hòa Hảo formed {{their own}} army and {{administration}} during the war, {{and started a}} de facto state in their Mekong Delta stronghold. They came into conflict with the Cao Đài, another new religious movement, which also boasted a private army and controlled a nearby region of southern Vietnam around Tây Ninh. Meanwhile, in Saigon, the Bình Xuyên organised crime syndicate ruled <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> through its gangster militia. These three southern forces vied for control of southern Vietnam with the main protagonists: the French, who were attempting to re-establish colonial control across the entire nation; and the communist-dominated Việt Minh, who sought Vietnamese independence.|$|E
5|$|While {{the raid}} did not achieve its aims, it had other effects. It raised Japanese civilians' {{awareness}} that their country was being defeated and received unduly positive media {{coverage in the}} United States. Intelligence gathered by the B-29s also revealed weaknesses in Japan's air defenses and the raid {{was the first of}} many on Japan. Yawata was attacked again by B-29s operating from China on 20August 1944 and <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was destroyed in a fire bombing raid conducted by B-29s based in the Mariana Islands on 8August 1945.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{the cathedral}} began {{during the reign}} of William the Conqueror after a fire in 1087 that {{destroyed}} <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Work took more than 200 years, and construction was delayed by another fire in 1135. The church was consecrated in 1240, enlarged in 1256 and enlarged again in the early 14th century.
