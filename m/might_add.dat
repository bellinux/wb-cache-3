5|$|Regardless of the {{historian}} (I <b>might</b> <b>add)</b> {{we have seen}} in our youth in the streets of Gniezno a wooden chapel, which in the vernacular lenguage is called vestibule, where exist two great stones in the shape of millstones reddened with the blood of that lady, who are completely worn and faded, and were deposited in her tomb at Gniezno cathedral.|$|E
5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I <b>might</b> <b>add,</b> cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E

25|$|In Indonesia, most of laksa {{variants}} are coconut milk-based soup, {{thus can}} be categorized into curry laksa. Common spices include turmeric, coriander, candlenut, lemongrass, garlic, shallot and pepper cooked in coconut milk. Widely available daun kemangi (Indonesian lemon basil leaf) is commonly used instead of daun kesum. Bihun or thin rice vermicelli is most commonly used noodle instead of thick rice noodle, and some recipe <b>might</b> <b>add</b> slices of ketupat or lontong rice cake. Bogor laksa uses ground oncom into its soup.|$|E
25|$|One <b>might</b> <b>add</b> to {{this list}} the translation, in Alfred's law code, of {{excerpts}} from the Vulgate Book of Exodus. The Old English versions of Orosius's Histories against the Pagans and Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred's own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences. Nonetheless the consensus remains that {{they were part of}} the Alfredian programme of translation. Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge suggest this also for Bald's Leechbook and the anonymous Old English Martyrology.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{discovery}} of Newton's law of universal gravitation in the 17th century, {{the stability of the}} Solar System has preoccupied many mathematicians, starting with Laplace. The stable orbits that arise in a two-body approximation ignore the influence of other bodies. The effect of these added interactions on the stability of the Solar System is very small, but at first it was not known whether they <b>might</b> <b>add</b> up over longer periods to significantly change the orbital parameters and lead to a completely different configuration, or whether some other stabilising effects might maintain the configuration of the orbits of the planets.|$|E
25|$|Meltwater around Greenland may {{transport}} {{nutrients in}} both dissolved and particulate phases to the ocean. Measurements {{of the amount}} of iron in meltwater from the Greenland ice sheet show that extensive melting of the ice sheet <b>might</b> <b>add</b> an amount of this micronutrient to the Atlantic Ocean equivalent to that added by airborne dust. However much of the particles and iron derived from glaciers around Greenland may be trapped within the extensive fjords that surround the island and, unlike the HNLC Southern ocean where iron is an extensive limiting micronutrient, biological production in the North Atlantic is subject only to very spatially and temporally limited periods of iron limitation. Nonetheless high productivity is observed in the immediate vicinity of major marine terminating glaciers around Greenland and this is attributed to meltwater inputs driving the upwelling of seawater rich in macronutrients.|$|E

500|$|The {{work was}} written {{sometime}} in the early 13th century, and is explicitly dedicated to Frederick II. The scholar James Wood Brown argues that the book was likely written and then presented to soon-to-be Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in AD 1209 {{on the occasion of}} his wedding to Constance of Aragon. Brown also adds, [...] "No date suits this publication so well as 1209, and nothing but the urgent desire of Court and people that the marriage should prove fruitful can explain, one <b>might</b> <b>add</b> excuse, some passages of almost fescennine license which it contains." [...] The philosophy and religion scholar Irven Resnick argues that the work was given to Frederick so that [...] "the emperor [...] to distinguish, from outward appearances, trustworthy and wise counselors from their opposite numbers." ...|$|E
500|$|Until {{asked to}} perform and {{interpret}} Joaquín Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez in 1991, de Lucía was not proficient at reading musical notation. Biographer Pohren, however, {{at the time}} of writing his biography in 1992, said that he was still not proficient and had found a bizarre way of learning the piece, locking himself away. His performance with the orchestra under Edmon Colomer was highly acclaimed, a sensitive, atmospheric rendition that composer Rodrigo himself praised, describing it as [...] "pretty, exotic, inspired" ... I <b>might</b> <b>add</b> that Paco plays it {{with a great deal of}} feeling, far more than is normally heard. And that goes for the orchestra that backs him up." [...] In 1992, he performed live at the bullring at Seville Expo '92, and a year later on the Plaza Mayor in Madrid, playing [...] "La Barrosa". In 1995, he and Bryan Adams recorded the hit song and video Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman on the soundtrack for the American film Don Juan DeMarco.|$|E
500|$|American {{officials}} were uncomfortable with Diefenbaker's initial election, believing {{they had heard}} undertones of anti-Americanism in the campaign. After years of the Liberals, one US State Department official noted, [...] "We'll be dealing with an unknown quantity." [...] Diefenbaker's 1958 landslide was viewed with disappointment by the US officials, who knew and liked Pearson from his years in diplomacy and who felt the Liberal Party leader {{would be more likely}} to institute pro-American policies. However, US President Dwight Eisenhower took pains to foster good relations with Diefenbaker. The two men found much in common, from Western farm backgrounds to a love of fishing, and Diefenbaker had an admiration for war leaders such as Eisenhower and Churchill. Diefenbaker wrote in his memoirs, [...] "I <b>might</b> <b>add</b> that President Eisenhower and I were from our first meeting on an 'Ike–John' basis, and that we were as close as the nearest telephone." [...] The Eisenhower–Diefenbaker relationship was sufficiently strong that the touchy Canadian Prime Minister was prepared to overlook slights. When Eisenhower addressed Parliament in October 1958, he downplayed trade concerns that Diefenbaker had publicly expressed. Diefenbaker said nothing and took Eisenhower fishing.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{disliked the}} game's control scheme, many {{stating that the}} use of the Wii remote was awkward and {{difficult}} to master. Bozon condemned the lack of refined flight control and noted that it was easier to use either the Classic Controller or the GameCube controller. Similarly, Scullion said that out of the three control schemes, the Wii remote was the least accurate option. VanOrd also criticized the poorly implemented use of the Wii remote, and Rosenberg thought its controls were overly responsive and unpolished; both reviewers recommended using the Classic Controller's analogue stick as an alternative. Dickens recognised that the original Nights into Dreams {{was one of the first}} games to benefit from an analogue stick, and was therefore surprised at how the sequel had a [...] "control scheme crisis": multiple control schemes <b>might</b> <b>add</b> confusion for new players. Govan suggested that the reason why the game featured alternative control schemes was that Sonic Team wanted to emulate the original Saturn controls. In contrast, the reviewer from Jeuxvideo.com found little fault with any of the game's control schemes, and Bedigan labelled them as [...] "excellent". Both reviewers, however, agreed that the Wii remote's motion controls did not work well with the game.|$|E

30|$|Due to high acidity and solubility, MCPM {{is never}} found in {{biological}} calcifications. Moreover, pure MCPM is not biocompatible with bones (Köster et al. 1977). However, in medicine MCPM {{is used as}} a component of several self-hardening CaPO 4 formulations (Huan and Chang 2009; Dorozhkin 2013 b). In addition, MCPM {{is used as a}} nutrient, acidulant and mineral supplement for food, feed and some beverages (Budavari et al. 1996; Stein et al. 2008). Coupled with NaHCO 3, MCPM is used as a leavening agent for both dry baking powders and bakery dough. MCPM <b>might</b> be <b>added</b> to salt-curing preserves, pickled and marinated foods. In addition, MCPM <b>might</b> be <b>added</b> to tooth pastes and chewing gums (Dorozhkin 2013 c). Besides, MCPM <b>might</b> be <b>added</b> to ceramics and glasses, while agriculture is the main consumer of a technical grade MCPM, where it is used as a fertilizer, triple superphosphate (Nasri et al. 2015).|$|R

2500|$|A {{geographic}} example {{may help}} to clarify the concept of linear independence. [...] A person describing {{the location of a}} certain place might say, [...] "It is 3 miles north and 4 miles east of here." [...] This is sufficient information to describe the location, because the geographic coordinate system may be considered as a 2-dimensional vector space (ignoring altitude and the curvature of the Earth's surface). [...] The person <b>might</b> <b>add,</b> [...] "The place is 5 miles northeast of here." [...] Although this last statement is true, it is not necessary.|$|E
2500|$|The {{experience}} quoted above certainly {{meets the}} second and third of these three criteria. [...] One <b>might</b> <b>add</b> that the ‘presence’ in such a case is experienced as located in a definite position in external physical space. [...] In this respect it may be said to be more hallucinatory than, for example, some hypnagogic imagery, which may be experienced as external to the subject but located in a mental ‘space’ of its own. Other explanations for this phenomenon were discussed by the psychologist Graham Reed who wrote that such experiences may involve illusion, misinterpretation or suggestion. He noted that the experiences are usually reported at moments of fatigue, stress, or during the night.|$|E
