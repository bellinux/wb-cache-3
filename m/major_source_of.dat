5|$|Although {{thallium}} is a modestly abundant {{element in}} the Earth's crust, with a concentration estimated to be about 0.7mg/kg, mostly in association with potassium-based minerals in clays, soils, and granites, thallium is not generally economically recoverable from these sources.

5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} and the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century.

Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861.

5|$|Gum-digging was the <b>major</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> {{income for}} {{settlers}} in Northland, and farmers often worked the gumfields {{in the winter}} months to subsidise the poor income from their unbroken land.

Gum-digging was not restricted to settlers or workers in the rural areas; Auckland families would cross the Waitematā Harbour by ferry at weekends to dig in the fields around Birkenhead, causing damage to public roads and private farms, and leading to local council management of the problem.|$|E
