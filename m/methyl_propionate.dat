40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} ionic {{strength}} on the macroscopic and microscopic redox potentials and the heme environment of cytochrome c 3 from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F {{have been investigated}} by NMR and electrochemical methods. The redox potentials of this tetraheme protein {{are found to be}} ionic strength-dependent. Especially, the microscopic redox potentials of hemes 2 and 3 at the fourth reduction step increase significantly with increasing ionic strength, which is in contradiction to the theoretical expectation. The coordinated imidazole proton signals are unaffected by ionic strength. However, the <b>methyl</b> and <b>propionate</b> proton signals of hemes 1 and 4 showed significant ionic strength dependencies that are distinct from those for hemes 2 and 3. This heme classification is the same as that found in the ionic strength dependencies of the microscopic redox potentials at the fourth reduction step. Furthermore, the effect of ionic strength on the electrostatic potentials at the heme irons has been examined on the theoretical basis. The electrostatic potential at heme 4 changes up to 1 M ionic strength, which was not expected from the observations reported on cytochromes so far. These results are discussed in connection with the reported anomalous ionic strength dependency of the reduction rate of cytochrome c 3...|$|R

CONNEY: Increased liver microsomal {{androgen}} metabolism by phenobarbital: Correlation with decreased androgen {{action on}} the seminal vesicles of the rat.,J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 188 : 2 S 7 - 292, 1974. Pretreatment of immature male rats with phenobarbital, a potent stimulator of micro-somal testosterone hydroxylation, decreased the growth-promoting effect of an exoge-nously administered dose of testosterone, testosterone <b>propionate,</b> <b>methyl</b> testosterone or fluoxymesterone on the seminal vesicles. Feeding 0. 01 to 0. 1 % phenobarbital in the diet for seven days, or for several months, decreased seminal vesicle weights, suggesting that phenobarbital may decrease the action of endogenously produced androgens by stimulating their metabolism. No effects of long-term phenobarbital administration on testicular w’eights were observed. Treatment of rats with many therapeutic agents and environmental chemicals increases the activity of liver microsomal enzymes that metabolize drugs, and this effect is often reflected in viva by a decreased action of the drugs (Con-nev, 1967).

40|$|Cherries are fruits {{containing}} {{fiber and}} bioactive compounds (e. g., polyphenolics) {{with the potential}} of helping patients with diabetes and weight disorders, a phenomenon likely related {{to changes in the}} complex host-microbiota milieu. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of cherry supplementation on the gut bacterial composition, concentrations of caecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and biomarkers of gut health using an in vivo model of obesity. Obese diabetic (db/db) mice received a supplemented diet with 10 % cherry powder (supplemented mice, n =  12) for 12 weeks; obese (n =  10) and lean (n =  10) mice served as controls and received a standard diet without cherry. High-throughput sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) were used to analyze the gut microbiota; SCFAs and biomarkers of gut health were also measured using standard techniques. According to 16 S sequencing, supplemented mice harbored a distinct colonic microbiota characterized by a higher abundance of mucin-degraders (i. e., Akkermansia) and fiber-degraders (the S 24 - 7 family) as well as lower abundances of Lactobacillus and Enterobacteriaceae. Overall this particular cherry-associated colonic microbiota did not resemble the microbiota in obese or lean controls based on the analysis of weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance metrics. qPCR confirmed some of the results observed in sequencing, thus supporting the notion that cherry supplementation can change the colonic microbiota. Moreover, the SCFAs detected in supplemented mice (caproate, <b>methyl</b> butyrate, <b>propionate,</b> acetate and valerate) exceeded those concentrations detected in obese and lean controls except for butyrate. Despite the changes in microbial composition and SCFAs, most of the assessed biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and intestinal health in colon tissues and mucosal cells were similar in all obese mice with and without supplementation. This paper shows that dietary supplementation with cherry powder for 12 weeks affects the microbiota and the concentrations of SCFAs in the lower intestinal tract of obese db/db diabetic mice. These effects occurred in absence of differences in most biomarkers of inflammation and other parameters of gut health. Our study prompts more research into the potential clinical implications of cherry consumption as a dietary supplement in diabetic and obese human patients...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The unique {{flavor of}} high quality Swiss cheese is {{difficult}} to reproduce in commercial market cheese. Swiss cheese flavor has never been duplicated or thoroughly understood. New techniques and advances in flavor research have enabled better definition and understanding of food flavors. Therefore, it was desirable to make a detailed investigation of Swiss cheese flavor. Neutral volatile flavor compounds were isolated from Swiss cheese fat by low-temperature low-pressure distillation. The compounds were separated by temperature programmed gas chromatography. Direct analysis of cheese fat and whole cheese from four domestic and two imported good flavored cheeses by gas entrainment and on-column trapping provided a further means of isolation of volatile flavor compounds in Swiss cheese. Gas chromatography in conjunction with rapid scan mass spectrometry and relative retention time data were used to identify compounds. Compounds positively identified by the distillation and on-column trapping techniques were as follows: methanol, ethanol, 1 -propanol, 1 -butanol, 2 -pentanol, trans- 2 -hexene- 1 -ol, 2 -phenylethanol, acetaldehyde, 2 -methyl propanal, 2 -methyl butyraldehyde, benzaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde, acetone, butanone, 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -heptanone, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, 2 -tridecanone, 2 -pentadecanone, hexane, octane, 1 -octene, nonane, 1 -nonene, dodecane, pentadecane, toluene, α-pinene, methyl acetate, methyl hexanoate, methyl octanoate, <b>methyl</b> decanoate, ethyl <b>propionate,</b> ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, butyl acetate, 3 -methyl butyl acetate, γ-valerolactone, γ-dodecalactone, δ-octalactone, δ-decalactone, δ-dodecalactone, dimethyl sulfide, diacetyl, benzothiazole, o-dichlorobenzene, 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene, di-isobutyl adipate, and chloroform. Compounds tentatively identified include an aromatic hydrocarbon, pinane, α-fenchene, ethyl benzene, a di-methyl benzene, methyl benzoate, 2 -phenyl- 2 -methyl butane, 5 -methyl- 5 -ethyl decane, 3 -methyl butyl octanoate, 2, 5 -dimethyl tetra decane, methyl vinyl ether and 2 -methyl propenal. The concentration of selected volatile compounds identified by the on-column trapping technique were determined by relating their peak heights to known quantities of compound. Average concentrations calculated from the mean values for all the six cheeses and expressed in parts per million were as follows: dimethyl sulfide. 0. 107; diacetyl, 0. 8; acetaldehyde, 1. 4; acetone, 1. 6; butanone, 0. 3; 2 -methyl butyraldehyde, 0. 42; 2 -pentanone, 0. 98; 2 -heptanone, 0. 45; ethanol, 16. 3; 2 -butanol, 0. 3; 1 -propanol, 2. 9; 1 -butanol, 0. 7; methyl hexanoate, 1. 5; and ethyl butanoate, 0. 6. Liquid-liquid partition chromatography and gas chromatography were utilized to determine quantitatively the major free, fatty acids in the six Swiss cheeses. 2 -Methyl butyric acid was detected in all cheeses and varied from 9. 0 to 100. 0 mg/kg cheese. The other isomeric acid, 3 -methyl butyric, was detected in only two cheeses. Formic acid was detected in only one cheese. No n-valeric or 2 -methyl propionic acids were detected.

Experimental {{results showed that}} the Zr-Mg-Cs/SiO 2 catalyst exhibited moderate activity for aldol condensation of <b>methyl</b> <b>propionate</b> with formaldehyde (FA) to produce methyl methacrylate. Though the activity of Zr-Mg-Cs/SiO 2 catalyst decreased with the time-on-stream, the deactivated catalyst was completely regenerated by calcination. The catalyst was regenerated 16 times and total operation time was over 500 h, its activity was identical with that of the fresh catalyst...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{homologous}} series of carboxylic esters, <b>methyl</b> <b>propionate</b> to methyl decanoate, on the steady-state inactivation of the sodium current in squid axons have been studied. The esters moved {{the relationship between the}} inactivation parameter, h infinity, and the membrane potential in the hyperpolarizing direction, thus reducing the number of sodium channels available at the resting potential. The concentration dependence of the shift at the mid-point of the curve of h infinity against potential has been measured for all esters except decanoate, which was almost inactive. Two aspects of these concentration dependences suggest that molecular volume is an important determinant of the effectiveness of each ester. Firstly, there is a sharp decline in activity above methyl hexanoate. This cut-off in activity resembles that for hydrocarbons where it has been suggested [e. g., Haydon, D. A., Urban, B. W. 1983, J. Physiol. (London) 341 : 411 - 427] to a result from a decrease in uptake with increasing molecular volume. (Further data for the hydrocarbons n-butane to n-heptane are reported here.) Secondly, the smallest compounds, <b>methyl</b> <b>propionate</b> and methyl butyrate, are less effective than would be predicted if equal membrane concentrations of each ester produced the same shift. The aqueous concentration dependences for these esters indicate that below methyl hexanoate, as the series is descended, progressively higher membrane concentrations are required to produce a given shift. This would be expected if the volume of ester in the membrane, rather than the number of molecules, is important. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E

40|$|Fructose- 2, 6 -bisphosphate (Fru- 2, 6 -bisP) was {{evaluated}} {{as a potential}} marker for the dormancy-breaking phase or the germination phase before pericarp splitting in red rice (Oryza sativa). During 4 h of imbibition at 30 [deg]C, Fru- 2, 6 -bisP of dehulled dormant and nondormant seeds increased to 0. 26 and 0. 38 pmol embryo- 1, respectively. In nondormant seeds, embryo Fru- 2, 6 -bisP content remained stable until the onset of pericarp splitting (12 h) and increased rapidly thereafter. In dormant seeds, Fru- 2, 6 -bisP declined to 0. 09 pmol embryo- 1 at 24 h. Embryo Fru- 2, 6 -bisP was correlated with O 2 uptake of dormant and nondormant seeds. A 24 -h exposure of dehulled, water-imbibed, dormant seeds to treatments yielding > 90 % germination (sodium nitrite [4 mM], propionic acid [22 mM], <b>methyl</b> <b>propionate</b> [32 mM], propanol [75 mM], and propionaldehyde [40 mM]) led to changes in embryo Fru- 2, 6 -bisP that were unrelated to the final germination percentages. Furthermore, a 2 -h pulse of propionaldehyde increased Fru- 2, 6 -bisP 4 -fold but did not break dormancy. Whereas nitrite and propionaldehyde increased Fru- 2, 6 -bisP to 0. 33 pmol embryo- 1 after 2 h of contact, propionic acid and <b>methyl</b> <b>propionate</b> did not increase Fru- 2, 6 -bisP above the untreated control. In all cases, further increases in Fru- 2, 6 -bisP occurred after pericarp splitting. However, the plateau Fru- 2, 6 -bisP attained during chemical contact was inversely correlated with elapsed time to 30 % germination (r = - 0. 978). Therefore, although Fru- 2, 6 -bisP is not a universal marker for dormancy release, its rapid increase during nitrite and propionaldehyde treatments suggests that events associated with dormancy breaking can occur within 2 h of chemical treatment...|$|E
