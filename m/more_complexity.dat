5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of evolutionary biology, studies of mutation and genetic diversity in natural populations, combined with biogeography and systematics, led to sophisticated mathematical and causal models of evolution. Paleontology and comparative anatomy allowed more detailed reconstructions of the evolutionary history of life. After the rise of molecular genetics in the 1950s, the field of molecular evolution developed, based on protein sequences and immunological tests, and later incorporating RNA and DNA studies. The gene-centered view of evolution rose to prominence in the 1960s, followed by the neutral theory of molecular evolution, sparking debates over adaptationism, the unit of selection, and {{the relative importance of}} genetic drift versus natural selection as causes of evolution. In the late 20th-century, DNA sequencing led to molecular phylogenetics and the reorganization of the tree of life into the three-domain system by Carl Woese. In addition, the newly recognized factors of symbiogenesis and horizontal gene transfer introduced yet <b>more</b> <b>complexity</b> into evolutionary theory. Discoveries in evolutionary biology have made a significant impact not just within the traditional branches of biology, but also in other academic disciplines (for example: anthropology and psychology) and on society at large.|$|E

25|$|Arcades {{catering}} to video games began {{to gain momentum}} in the late 1970s with games such as Space Invaders (1978), Asteroids (1979), and Galaxian (1979), and became widespread in 1980 with Pac-Man, Missile Command, Berzerk, Defender, and others. The central processing unit in these games allowed for <b>more</b> <b>complexity</b> than earlier discrete circuitry games such as Atari's Pong (1972). The arcade boom {{that began in the}} late 1970s is credited with establishing the basic techniques of interactive entertainment and for driving down hardware prices to the extent of allowing the PC to become a technological and economic reality.|$|E
25|$|The Strategic Air Command was {{concerned}} that externally mounting the RASCAL and the associated internal equipment needed to support the missile would seriously degrade {{the performance of the}} bomber. The performance impact was great enough to make the B-47/RASCAL combination of questionable value. SAC also argued the B-47/RASCAL combination might never work well. Since the equipment being added to the B-47 to guide the missile added <b>more</b> <b>complexity</b> to the already complex B-47. Then the modification costs required to carry the RASCAL added nearly US $1 million to the cost of every B-47. To SAC these costs seemed premature considering the state of the RASCAL's development at that time. Finally SAC considered it unwise to commit aircraft and to start training crews before the missile's development had been completed.|$|E
25|$|Outside Barolo & Barbaresco, Nebbiolo {{is found}} in the DOCG wines of Ghemme and Gattinara in the Novara and Vercelli hills of {{northern}} Piedmont. In these regions the grape is known as Spanna and tends to produce lighter, more earthy wines. Rather than mandate a 100% Nebbiolo, producers are allowed to blend a small percentage of Bonarda, Croatina and Vespolina though most modern producers favor a high percentage of Nebbiolo. In the northwestern corner of Piedmont, near the Valle d'Aosta, the cool climate of Carema DOC produces Nebbiolo wines with lots of perfume but in some vintages will have difficulties with ripeness. In the Roero district located across the Tanaro river from Barolo & Barbaresco, the wines tend to be less tannic and lighter while those produced in nearby Alba under the Nebbiolo d'Alba DOC can have <b>more</b> <b>complexity</b> and body.|$|E

Many actors auditioned for the part, but Whedon felt Metcalf played it with <b>more</b> <b>complexity,</b> bringing a [...] "sly and kind of urbane" [...] sensitivity and a charm to the villainy of the character. Kristine Sutherland was cast as Buffy's mother Joyce. Sutherland, who disliked the horror genre, was not looking for acting jobs when her agent called her with the opportunity to play Joyce. Sutherland auditioned the same day as David Boreanaz, and was impressed with how naturally she felt at ease with the material in the scripts. Bob Flutie, Sunnydale High School's principal, was originally played by Stephen Tobolowsky in the unaired pilot. Ken Lerner was cast as Flutie in the broadcast version.|$|E

Although the Daddies have been cited as an influence on ska punk bands the Mad Caddies and Spring Heeled Jack U.S.A., SF Weekly claims the group has [...] "never gotten the accolades it deserves" [...] for their eclectic funk-ska repertoire.

500|$|The most {{expensive}} wines made from Riesling are late harvest dessert wines, produced by letting the grapes {{hang on the}} vines well past normal picking time. Through evaporation caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea ("noble rot") or by freezing, {{as in the case}} of ice wine (in German, Eiswein), water is removed and the resulting wine is felt to offer richer layers on the palate. These concentrated wines have more sugar (in extreme cases hundreds of grams per litre), more acid (to give balance to the sugar), more flavour, and <b>more</b> <b>complexity.</b> These elements combine to make wines which are amongst the most long lived of all white wines. The beneficial use of [...] "noble rot" [...] in Riesling grapes was discovered in the late 18th century at Schloss Johannisberg. Permission from the Abbey of Fulda (which owned the vineyard) to start picking Riesling grapes arrived too late and the grapes had begun to rot; yet it turned out that the wine made from them was still of excellent quality.|$|E

500|$|The {{writing and}} {{narrative}} were well received by critics, with Andy Goergen of Nintendo World Report labeling it as [...] "a strong argument for video {{games as a}} new medium of storytelling". Reviewers at Famitsu called the story enigmatic and thrilling. Carolyn Petit at GameSpot felt that the lengthy Novel sections amplified the fear and tension throughout the game, while Heidi Kemps of GamesRadar compared them to [...] "high-quality thriller novels". Jason Schreier of Wired criticized the prose for being inconsistent, but said {{that the use of}} the narrator was clever and unusual. Susan Arendt at The Escapist called the story multi-layered and horrifying. Zach Kaplan at Nintendo Life liked the dialogue, but found the third-person narration to be dull and slow, with out-of-place or clichéd metaphors and similes. Both Chris Schilling at Eurogamer and Lucas M. Thomas at IGN felt that the urgency portrayed in the game's story sometimes was at odds with the tone or timing of the dialogue, such as lengthy conversations while trapped inside a freezer, or lighthearted dialogue and jokes. Thomas called the premise gripping, and said that the mythology, conspiracies and character backgrounds were engrossing. Tony Ponce at Destructoid said that the characters initially seemed like a [...] "stock anime cast", but that the player discovers <b>more</b> <b>complexity</b> in them after moving past first impressions. Kaplan felt that each character was well developed, fleshed out and unique, and could pass for real people.|$|E

Of Dylan's storyline and involvement in the love triangle, Phelps said: [...] "Dylan does come to town to find Avery but this story has much <b>more</b> <b>complexity</b> than that [...] What {{you think is going to}} happen is not what's going to happen."

[...] Dylan and Avery had an affair while she was still married to her ex-husband, but still had a [...] "great relationship", which was shown through flashbacks. Dylan's primary goal in coming to Genoa City was to make sure she was happy, and if she wanted to get back together. Burton said that Dylan can't get Avery off his mind despite the fact that she had moved on.|$|E
500|$|Languages differ {{widely in}} how much they rely on {{morphological}} processes of word formation. In some languages, for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called isolating, or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in {{the degree to which}} morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word bonus, or [...] "good", consists of the root bon-, meaning [...] "good", and the suffix -us, which indicates masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. These languages are called fusional languages, because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite of fusional languages are agglutinative languages which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is Turkish, where for example, the word evlerinizden, or [...] "from your houses", consists of the morphemes, ev-ler-iniz-den with the meanings house-plural-your-from. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called polysynthetic languages. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example, in Persian the single word nafahmidamesh means I didn't understand it consisting of morphemes na-fahm-id-am-esh with the meanings, [...] "negation.understand.past.I.it". As another example with <b>more</b> <b>complexity,</b> in the Yupik word tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq, which means [...] "He had not yet said again {{that he was going to}} hunt reindeer", the word consists of the morphemes tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq with the meanings, [...] "reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative", and except for the morpheme tuntu ("reindeer") none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.|$|E
