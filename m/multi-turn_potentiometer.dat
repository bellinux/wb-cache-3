50|$|A string {{potentiometer}} is a <b>multi-turn</b> <b>potentiometer</b> {{operated by}} an attached reel of wire turning against a spring, enabling it to convert linear position to a variable resistance.|$|E
50|$|One {{approach}} to test loads uses {{a set of}} resistors of different values, and manual intervention. In contrast, an active load presents to the source a resistance value varied by electronic control, either by an analogue adjusting device such as a <b>multi-turn</b> <b>potentiometer</b> or, in automated test setups, by a digital computer. The load resistance can often be varied rapidly {{in order to test}} the power supply's transient response.|$|E
5000|$|Trimmers come in {{a variety}} of sizes and levels of precision. For example, <b>multi-turn</b> trim <b>potentiometers</b> exist, in which it takes several turns of the {{adjustment}} screw to reach the end value. This allows for very high degrees of accuracy. Often they make use of a worm-gear (rotary track) or a leadscrew (linear track).|$|R

Journal of Glaciology, 48 (160) pp. 1 - 8 RAE 2008 A rigid mast, equipped with five <b>multi-turn</b> <b>potentiometers,</b> was {{bolted to the}} bedrock floor of a frontal cavity at Glacier de Tsanfleuron, Switzerland. Each potentiometer was linked by a thin cord to an anchor emplaced in the adjacent ice wall, enabling basal ice motion to be measured continually over a 6 day period in the late summer. Results indicate that basal ice velocity increased quasi-linearly away from the glacier bed, rising from 10. 66 to 11. 82 mm d- 1 between 25 and ? 265 mm above the ice-bed interface. Extrapolation of this gradient indicates that ? 10. 55 mm d- 1 may have been accommodated by pure slip between the ice and the glacier bed. Basal ice motion is temporally variable, generally being characterized by tens of minutes to hours of little or no motion interspersed with rapid-motion events lasting for between 400 mm d- 1 over individual measurement intervals. The magnitude-frequency distribution of these events {{is consistent with a}} pattern of infrequent and large slips initiated at the ice [...] bed interface, that are manifested as more frequent and smaller motion events some tens of cm above that interface.
