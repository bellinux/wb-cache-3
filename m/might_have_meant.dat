Scholars have disagreed on the military value of the ceorl, but {{it is not surprising that}} all free men would fight, since defeat <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> slavery.|$|E
500|$|The two ancient Sumerian words [...] "Salu-ki" [...] {{translate}} into [...] "plunge-earth." [...] However, {{there is no}} evidence the breed was referred to by the Sumerians with this name nor what [...] "plunge to earth" [...] <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> in reference to the Saluki. The name of the breed first appeared in writing in pre-Islamic Arabic poetry and may have derived from [...] "Saluqiyyah," [...] the Arabic form of Seleucia. However, this is disputed. British diplomat Sir Terence Clark wrote that the Arabic word [...] "Saluqi" [...] describes a person or thing from a place named Saluq.|$|E
500|$|Parsons and Parsons {{have shown}} that {{juvenile}} and sub-adult specimens of Deinonychus display some morphological differences with the adults. For instance, {{the arms of the}} younger specimens were proportionally longer than those of the adults, a possible indication of difference in behavior between young and adults. Another example of this could be the function of the pedal claws. Parsons and Parsons have suggested that the claw curvature (which Ostrom [...] had already shown was different between specimens) maybe was greater for juvenile Deinonychus, as this could help it climb in trees, and that the claws became straighter as the animal became older and started to live solely on the ground. This was based on the hypothesis that some small dromaeosaurids used their pedal claws for climbing. In a 2015 paper, they reported after further analysis of immature fossils that the open and mobile nature of the shoulder joint <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> that young Deinonychus were capable of some form of flight.|$|E

500|$|When it opened, the Metropolitan Railway had a {{significant}} impact on street traffic, particularly cabs and omnibuses but these quickly recovered to near their former levels, despite the Metropolitan Railway also carrying over 9 million passengers in its first year of operation. The Metropolitan Railway and the network of underground lines that grew from it was the first in the world and the idea was not adopted elsewhere until 1896 when the Budapest Metro and the Glasgow Subway were both opened. Without Pearson's promotion of the idea of an underground railway when he did it is possible that transport developments at the end of the 19th century [...] developments, such as electric trams and vehicles powered by internal combustion engines, <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> the underground solution was ignored. The expansion of the capital that the underground network and its suburban surface extensions enabled was considerable and rapid and helped the population of what is now Greater London to increase from 3,094,391 in 1861 to 6,226,494 in 1901.|$|E
500|$|It is {{not known}} when Qatna lost its independence. It became a Mitannian vassal in the 16th century BC, but the archive of Qatna proves that even in its final period during the 14th century BC, Qatna {{maintained}} {{a certain degree of}} autonomy. Early Egyptian military intrusions to the region occurred under Thutmose I (...) [...] The name Qedem appears in an inscription found on a fragmented gateway from Karnak dated to the reign of Thutmose mentioning a military campaign in the northern Levant. The inscription suggests that the mentioned cities submitted to the king. The geographic sequence given in the inscription is Qedem ("Qdm"), Tunip ("Twnjp") and [...] "Ḏj3 wny" [...] (maybe Siyannu); Qatna (Qdn in Egyptian) would fit better in the geographic sequence and Alexander Ahrens suggested that the inscription <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> Qatna. Any oaths of loyalty to Egypt taken by Levantine rulers were forgotten after Thutmose I's death. The Egyptians returned under the leadership of Thutmose III (...) , who reached Qatna during his eighth Asiatic campaign, [...] Thutmose III did not rule directly in Qatna but established vassalage ties and attended an archery contest with the Qaṭanean king.|$|E
2500|$|Reading in [...] {{the command}} {{to take into}} the Ark [...] "of the fowl also of the air, seven each," [...] a Midrash {{hypothesized}} that the command <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> seven of each kind of animal (three of one gender and four of the other). But then {{one of them would}} lack a mate. Hence the Midrash concluded that God meant seven males and seven females. Of course God did not need them, but they were to come (in the words of [...] ) [...] "to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth." ...|$|E
50|$|These insurrectionists <b>might</b> well <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> {{to destroy}} the mayor’s office, and thereby all the deeds - {{particularly}} the land survey - as well, whereupon they would then have divided the land up among themselves.

2500|$|Jesus {{said that}} some made {{themselves}} [...] "eunuchs" [...] for the Kingdom of Heaven (...)

50|$|The Tecoxquines (Aztec Group) {{engraved}} {{images in}} volcanic stone over {{two thousand years}} ago near Las Piletas. These petroglyphs perhaps were symbolic elements of everyday life, as far as health, fertility, rains, and crops. The rock carvings <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been <b>meant</b> as prayers or offerings to the gods responsible for these things.|$|R
2500|$|The Gemara {{asked why}} the Tannaim felt that the {{allocation}} of the Land of Israel [...] "according to {{the names of the}} tribes of their fathers" [...] in [...] meant that the allocation was with reference to those who left Egypt; perhaps, the Gemara supposed, it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> the 12 tribes and that the Land was to be divided into 12 equal portions? The Gemara noted that in [...] God told Moses to tell the Israelites who were about to leave Egypt, [...] "And I will give it you for a heritage; I am the Lord," [...] and that meant that the Land was the inheritance from the fathers of those who left Egypt.|$|E
2500|$|The English word borax is Latinized: [...] the Middle English {{form was}} boras, from Old French boras, bourras. That {{may have been}} from medieval Latin baurach (another English spelling), borac(-/um/em), borax, or maybe {{directly}} from the Arabic, along with Spanish borrax (> borraj) and Italian borrace, in the 9th century. The Arabic word is [...] / ("natron"), a word also used for borax. [...] Traditional Arabic dictionaries say that it derives from the verb [...] "to glisten", which is also written [...] , {{but it seems to}} actually derive from the Persian [...] ( [...] "borax"). The word [...] is found in Arabic [...] (...) , meaning [...] "white"; which is from Middle Persian , which <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> potassium nitrate or another fluxing agent, now known as [...] (...)

60|$|Mr. Troy {{took refuge}} in dumb diplomacy--he made a low bow. It <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> that he {{believed}} Isabel, or it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> that he modestly withdrew his own opinion into the background.

5000|$|The justices {{asked him}} to {{distinguish}} the two acts. Downey answered that the 1934 Act <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been <b>meant</b> to protect sellers less.

60|$|The {{door was}} opened to him, {{not by the}} old man {{with whom he had}} {{exchanged}} amenities on the previous night, but by a short, thick fellow, who looked exactly like a picture of a loafer from the pages of a comic journal.

50|$|Thus {{he arrived}} {{in one of the}} most {{important}} offices of the city. The elevation of his family into the peerage a few weeks later <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been <b>meant</b> more for him than for his father.

60|$|She {{looked at}} him fixedly, {{looked at him}} as though she searched for {{something}} in his face, or was pondering over something in his tone. It was a moment which <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> much.

25|$|These epithets are {{associated}} with the ritual function of Janus in the opening of the Porta Ianualis or Porta Belli. The rite might go back to times pre-dating the founding of Rome. Poets tried to explain this rite by imagining that the gate closed either war or peace inside the ianus, but in its religious significance it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been <b>meant</b> to propitiate the return home of the victorious soldiers.|$|R
60|$|She {{bowed to}} Somerset {{in a way}} which <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been <b>meant</b> to express that she had {{discovered}} her mistake; but there was no embarrassment in her manner, and the carriage bore her away without her making any sign for checking it.

50|$|From {{the end of}} the 10th {{through the}} 13th centuries, chroniclers of the Crusades used the word lituus vaguely—along with the Classical Latin names for other Roman {{military}} trumpets and horns, such as the tuba, cornu, and buccina and the more up-to-date French term trompe—to describe various instruments employed in the Christian armies. However, it is impossible to determine just what sort of instrument <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been <b>meant,</b> and it is unlikely there litui were the same as the Etrusco-Roman instrument.|$|R

But as nothing occurred to give this idea (which was sufficiently improbable in itself) any touch of confirmation, and as time was slipping by, and he had none to lose, he felt that he must act, without hesitating any longer.|$|R
5000|$|While {{insisting that}} they never called {{themselves}} Murut, the Lun Bawangs were formerly identified as Murut by the British colonists and by outsiders (other ethnic group). In Lun Bawang language, the word Murut either means 'to massage' or 'to give dowry', and these meanings {{have little or no}} relation at all to the identity of the people. The name Murut <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been derived from the word [...] "Murud", a mountain located near an old Lun Bawang settlement, hence <b>might</b> <b>have</b> just <b>meant</b> 'mountain men' or 'hill people' but was instead used by the colonist to identify this ethnic.|$|R

25|$|Many of {{the late}} Neolithic stone balls have diameters differing by only a millimetre.

He adds that the words pallu, pella, and pell in the Dravidian family of languages signify [...] "tooth or tusk", also [...] "elephant tooth or tusk". Anita Raina Thapan notes that the root word pille in the name Pillaiyar <b>might</b> <b>have</b> originally <b>meant</b> [...] "the young of the elephant", because the Pali word pillaka means [...] "a young elephant".|$|R
