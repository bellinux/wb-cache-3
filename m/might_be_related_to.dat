5|$|Earlier ornithologists {{felt that}} the kakapo <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the ground parrots and night parrot of Australia due to their similar colouration, but this is contradicted by recent studies; rather, the cryptic colour seems to be {{adaptation}} to terrestrial habits that evolved twice convergently.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of the invertebrate population in the canopy of Banksia woodland found that mites and ticks (Acari), beetles (Coleoptera) and ants, bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) predominated overall, with the three orders also common on B. ilicifolia, although outnumbered by thrips (Thysanoptera). More arthropods on B. ilicifolia <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> a higher nutrient (potassium) level in the leaves. Lower overall numbers of invertebrates on Banksia species {{were thought to be}} related to the presence of insectivorous birds.|$|E

5|$|There are {{no known}} {{morphological}} {{differences between the}} three island populations, but Turvey and colleagues found that animals from Nevis were slightly smaller than those from the two other islands. Such a difference in size <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the fact that Saint Kitts is larger than Nevis, {{in accordance with the}} trend that animals become larger on larger islands. However, Turvey and colleagues also observed that their Saint Kitts material consisted of older individuals than those from Nevis; thus, the size difference may result from differences in the mode of exploitation by Amerindians.|$|E
5|$|From the 1970s to the 1990s, {{there have}} been {{suggestions}} that the ruffed lemurs <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> indriids or a sister group to Lemuridae and Indriidae and that the bamboo lemurs {{are related to the}} sportive lemurs, but neither view is supported by molecular phylogeny. The sportive lemurs and the extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapidae) both lack upper incisors in the permanent dentition, and in 1981, Groves placed both together in the family Megaladapidae, which he renamed Lepilemuridae in 2005 because that older name takes precedence. Genetic research does not support a close relationship between the sportive and koala lemurs and instead places the koala lemurs as a sister group to Lemuridae; therefore, the two are now placed in separate families (Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and Megaladapidae for the koala lemurs). The sloth lemurs (Palaeopropithecidae) and monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae) were classified as subfamilies within Indriidae as late as 1982, but are now recognized as separate families.|$|E
5|$|While in Vietnam, the {{veterans}} were {{told not to}} worry, and were persuaded the chemical was harmless. After returning home, Vietnam veterans began to suspect their ill health or the instances of their wives having miscarriages or children born with birth defects <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Agent Orange and the other toxic herbicides to {{which they had been}} exposed in Vietnam. Veterans began to file claims in 1977 to the Department of Veterans Affairs for disability payments for health care for conditions they believed were associated with exposure to Agent Orange, or more specifically, dioxin, but their claims were denied unless they could prove the condition began when they were in the service or within one year of their discharge.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{if we have}} {{economic}} data on the consumption, income, and wealth of various individuals and we wish {{to see if there}} is a relationship between consumption and income, failing to control for wealth when computing a correlation coefficient between consumption and income would give a misleading result, since income <b>might</b> <b>be</b> numerically <b>related</b> <b>to</b> wealth which in turn <b>might</b> <b>be</b> numerically <b>related</b> <b>to</b> consumption; a measured correlation between consumption and income <b>might</b> actually <b>be</b> contaminated by these other correlations.

25|$|Object {{composition}} and inheritance: Whereas explicit function-based delegation does cover composition in JavaScript, implicit delegation already happens {{every time the}} prototype chain is walked in order to, e.g., find a method that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> but is not directly owned by an object. Once the method is found it gets called within this object's context. Thus inheritance in JavaScript is covered by a delegation automatism that is bound to the prototype property of constructor functions.|$|E
50|$|Subsequent {{ultrastructure}} research {{showed that}} the Hymenochaetales had dolipores with imperforate parenthesomes, whereas most Agaricomycetes have dolipores with perforate parenthesomes.

25|$|Brown-headed nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) {{have been}} {{observed}} to methodically use bark pieces to remove other flakes of bark from a tree. The birds insert the bark piece underneath an attached bark scale, using it like a wedge and lever, to expose hiding insects. Occasionally, they reuse the same piece of bark several times and sometimes even fly short distances carrying the bark flake in their beak. The evolutionary origin of this tool use <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> these birds frequently wedging seeds into cracks in the bark to hammer them open with their beak, {{which can lead to}} bark coming off.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1990s, the {{connection}} between string theory and moonshine has led to further results in mathematics and physics. In 2010, physicists Tohru Eguchi, Hirosi Ooguri, and Yuji Tachikawa discovered connections between a different sporadic group, the Mathieu group , and a certain version of string theory. Miranda Cheng, John Duncan, and Jeffrey A. Harvey proposed a generalization of this moonshine phenomenon called umbral moonshine, and their conjecture was proved mathematically by Duncan, Michael Griffin, and Ken Ono. Witten has also speculated that the version of string theory appearing in monstrous moonshine <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> a certain simplified model of gravity in three spacetime dimensions.|$|E
25|$|When nests {{are also}} found built among the {{branches}} of various trees, {{the architecture of the}} nest is changed because of the substrate to which it has to attach. The most noticeable difference is that R. romandi nests connected to branches are sphericsl rather than hemispherical and mostly double-layered, with only a few single-layered sections. The envelope is not a gray color, but instead a creamy brown, suggesting differences in the plants available to construct the nest. The saliva coating of the envelope is thicker when built in trees, suggesting that the thickness of the coat <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the rain exposure of the nest location. Instead of a roof, the nests often use leaves from the tree, incorporated into the envelope, to cover the top of the nest. The number of combs in a branch-built nest is almost double that of one built on a solid surface, however they are much more irregular in shape and arrangement.|$|E
30|$|ER stress-induced {{inflammation}} {{is mainly}} mediated by nuclear factor-kappa B (Hu et al. 2006; Zhang and Kaufman 2008 a). As the expression level of p 65 was increased by BTX-A injection in this study, ER stress-induced inflammation {{was evident in}} the BTX-A injected masseter muscle. Accordingly, overexpression of Bcl- 2 is important in the protection of cells against ER stress-induced apoptosis (Heath-Engel et al. 2008). The proapoptotic and anti-tumor activity of BTX-A <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> SNAP- 25 (Matak and Lackovic 2015). The light chains of BTX-A are mainly localized to the plasma membrane in non-neuronal cell lines (Fernández-Salas et al. 2004) and might impair mitochondrial respiration. This mechanism <b>might</b> also <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the changes following BTX-A injection in the acute phase. The exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated.|$|R

25|$|The Ezō wolf, or Hokkaidō wolf (Canis lupus hattai Kishida, 1931) is an extinct {{subspecies}} of {{the gray}} wolf (Canis lupus). In 1890, the skulls of Japanese wolves (Canis lupus hodophilax) were {{compared with those of}} wolves from Hokkaido in the British Museum. The specimens were noticeably different and explained to be local varieties of the same subspecies. Later, explorers to the Kuril islands of Iturup and Kunashir believed that the wolves they saw there were the Japanese subspecies. In 1889, the wolf became extinct on Hokkaido island. In 1913, Hatta Suburō proposed that the wolf <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the Siberian wolf but had no living specimens to undertake further analysis. In 1931, Kishida Kyukishi described a skull from a wolf killed in 1881 and declared it to be a distinct subspecies. In 1935, Pocock examined one of the specimens in the British Museum that had been obtained in 1886 and named it Canis lupus rex because of its large size.|$|E
25|$|Another Pachyrhinosaurus bonebed, on the Wapiti River {{south of}} Beaverlodge in northwestern Alberta, was worked briefly by {{staff of the}} Royal Tyrrell Museum in the late 1980s but is now worked {{annually}} for a couple weeks each summer (since 2006) by the University of Alberta. Material from this site appears referable to Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis. In 1974, Grande Prairie, Alberta science teacher Al Lakusta found a large bonebed along Pipestone Creek in Alberta. When the area was finally excavated between 1986 and 1989 by staff and volunteers of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology, paleontologists discovered an amazingly large and dense selection of bones—up to 100per square meter, {{with a total of}} 3500bones and 14skulls. This was apparently the site of a mass mortality, perhaps a failed attempt to cross a river during a flood. Found amongst the fossils were the skeletons of four distinct age groups ranging from juveniles to full grown dinosaurs, indicating that the Pachyrhinosaurus cared for their young. The adult skulls had both convex and concave bosses as well as unicorn-style horns on the parietal bone just behind their eyes. The concave boss types <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> erosion only and not reflect male/female differences.|$|E
25|$|Widespread basalt {{volcanism}} {{occurred between}} 60.9 and 61.3 {{million years ago}} in the northern Labrador Sea, Davis Strait and in southern Baffin Bay on the eastern coast of Nunavut during the Paleocene period when North America and Greenland were being separated from tectonic movements. This resulted from seafloor spreading where new ocean seafloor was being created from rising magma. Scientific studies have indicated nearly 80% of the magma was erupted in one million years or less. The source for this volcanic activity was the Iceland plume along with its surface expression, the Iceland hotspot. This volcanic activity formed part of a large igneous province that is sunken beneath the northern Labrador Sea. Another period of volcanic activity began in the same region about 55million years ago during the Eocene period when the north-south trending Mid-Atlantic Ridge began to form under the northern Atlantic Ocean east of Greenland. The cause of this volcanism <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> partial melting from movement of a transform fault system extending from Labrador Sea to the south and Baffin Bay to the north. Although the region was carried away from the Iceland plume by going plate motion over millions of years, the source of the partial melting for the final period of volcanic activity may have been remnants of still anomalously hot Iceland plume magma which were left stranded beneath the North American lithosphere in the Paleocene period. Most diatremes in the Northwest Territories were formed by volcanic eruptions between 45and 75million years ago during the Eocene and Late Cretaceous periods.|$|E
