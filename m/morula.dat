Almost {{all of the}} methylations from the parents are erased, first during gametogenesis, and again in early embryogenesis, with demethylation and remethylation occurring each time. [...] Demethylation in early embryogenesis occurs in the preimplantation period in two stages – initially in the zygote, then {{during the first few}} embryonic replication cycles of <b>morula</b> and blastula. A wave of methylation then takes place during the implantation stage of the embryo, with CpG islands protected from methylation. [...] This results in global repression and allows housekeeping genes to be expressed in all cells. In the post-implantation stage, methylation patterns are stage- and tissue-specific, with changes that would define each individual cell type lasting stably over a long period.|$|E
60|$|In certain animals {{belonging}} to {{every one of}} the chief groups into which the Metazoa are divisible, the cells of the cell-aggregate which results from the process of yelk-division, and which is termed a <b>morula,</b> diverge from one another in such a manner as to give rise to a central space, around which they dispose themselves as a coat or envelope; and thus the <b>morula</b> becomes a vesicle filled with fluid, the planula. The wall of the planula is next pushed in on one side, or invaginated, whereby it is converted into a double-walled sac with an opening, the blastopore, which leads into the cavity lined by the inner wall. This cavity is the primitive alimentary cavity or archenteron; the inner or invaginated layer is the hypoblast; the outer the epiblast; and the embryo, in this stage, is termed a gastrula. In all the higher animals a layer of cells makes its appearance between the hypoblast and the epiblast, and is termed the mesoblast. In the further course of development the epiblast becomes the ectoderm or epidermic layer of the body; the hypoblast becomes the epithelium of the middle portion of the alimentary canal; and the mesoblast gives rise to all the other tissues, except the central nervous system, which originates from an ingrowth of the epiblast.|$|E

The <b>morulae</b> were more often detected into lymphocytes than monocytes. The highest total number of <b>morulae</b> (n = 143) were found in P-D smears.

After labelling for 24 h with [5, 6 - 3 H]undine, late <b>morulae</b> (96 h post-hCG), early blastocysts (100 h post-hCG), or late blastocysts (120 h post-hCG) were homogenized in detergent buffer, and 11000 g supernatants were prepared and centrifuged through 15 - 40 % sucrose gradients. Poly(A) +RNA was isolated from the appropriate gradient fractions by affinity chromatography. In late <b>morulae</b> beginning to undergo cavitation, poly(A) +RNA was evenly distributed between {{the two types of}} RNP particles whereas it was almost entirely in the ribosomal/polysomal fraction in early and late blastocysts. The sedimentation profile (in 5 - 20 % sucrose gradients) of poly(A) +RNA from the ribosomal/polysomal fraction of late <b>morulae</b> and blastocysts was the same, with a range of 4 S to greater than 28 S and a modal peak slightly smaller than 18 S. Roughly 75 % of this RNA was judged to be functional mRNA based on the EDTA sensitivity of the RNP particles containing it. Poly(A) +RNA from the subribosomal fraction of late <b>morulae</b> displayed a similar range of sedimentation values, but was enriched for a component sedimenting at 6 - 7 S. These results demonstrate that the subcellular {{distribution of}} poly(A) +RNA shifts as cavitation begins, with the decline of the non-translating, subribosomal fraction. Although most of this fraction in late <b>morulae</b> is probably too small to constitute translatable mRNA, the remainder may represent a reserve available for recruitment into polyribosomes to support blastocyst expansion. Since little non-translating mRNA exists in blastocysts, the increasing rate of protein synthesis during blastocyst expansion must be driven by mRNA accumulation and/or stabilization...|$|R
40|$|A {{divergent}} selection experiment for {{litter size}} variability {{was carried out}} in rabbits. The litter size variability was estimated as the phenotypic variance of litter size within female. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effect of selecting for litter size variability on early embryonic development and survival after 7 generations of divergent selection (high and low variability lines). A total of 30 non-lactating multiparous does per line were used. The ovulation rate and early embryonic development were analysed using Bayesian methodology. Ovulation rate was not affected by the selection process. At 28 h of gestation, embryonic development and survival were similar in both lines. At 48 h of gestation, the majority of embryos in the high line were in the early <b>morulae</b> stage. The high line had a higher proportion of early <b>morulae</b> (79. 54 vs. 53. 43 %; P= 0. 94) and a lower proportion of compacted <b>morulae</b> (20. 46 vs. 46. 57 %; P= 0. 93 %) than the low line. At 72 h of gestation, the high line had 1. 59 fewer embryos than the more homogeneous line (P= 0. 85), due to reduced embryonic survival (0. 60 vs. 0. 74; P= 0. 93). The high line continued to show a higher proportion of early <b>morulae</b> (21. 01 vs. 3. 69 %; P= 0. 93) and a lower proportion of compacted <b>morulae</b> and blastocysts (78. 99 vs. 96. 31 %; P= 0. 94) than the low line at 72 h of gestation, indicative of reduced embryonic development.

40|$|We {{successfully}} propagated Ehrlichia chaffeensis in mouse embryo, Vero, BGM, and L 929 cells inoculated with host cell-free ehrlichiae, {{indicating that}} E. chaffeensis {{is capable of}} entry, survival, and growth in a relatively wide range of cell types derived from different species. We demonstrated rapid adaptation of E. chaffeensis in these cell lines, so that typical <b>morulae</b> could be detected as early as 5 days after inoculation. E. chaffeensis-induced cytopathic effect with different morphological characteristics in mouse embryo, Vero, and L 929 cells. The earliest cytopathic effect appeared in untreated and irradiated mouse embryo cells at 4 days postinoculation. As the infected foci gradually expanded, {{the center of the}} foci showed necrotic cells with pyknotic nuclei and degraded <b>morulae.</b> E. chaffeensis caused cell lysis in untreated and irradiated L 929 cells, with formation of distinct, round macroscopic plaques at 18 days postinoculation. In untreated and irradiated Vero cells, E. chaffeensis produced infected foci composed of loosely interwoven necrotic cells, spaces of detached cells, cells filled with <b>morulae,</b> and uninfected cells, resulting in characteristic reticular foci. Irradiated cells generally contained many large <b>morulae</b> and presented larger cytopathic foci. DH 82 and BGM cells did not develop obvious cytopathic foci under the conditions employed.

40|$|The {{permeability}} {{of cells}} is important for cryopreservation. Previously, we showed in mice that the permeability to water and cryoprotectants of oocytes and embryos at early cleavage stages (early embryos) is low because these molecules move across the plasma membrane predominantly by simple diffusion through the lipid bilayer, whereas permeability of <b>morulae</b> and blastocysts is high because of a water channel, aquaporin 3 (AQP 3). In this study, we examined the pathways for the movement of water and cryoprotectants in bovine oocytes/ embryos {{and the role of}} AQP 3 in the movement by determining permeability, first in intact bovine oocytes/embryos, then in bovine <b>morulae</b> with suppressed AQP 3 expression, and finally in mouse oocytes expressing bovine AQP 3. Results suggest that water moves through bovine oocytes and early embryos slowly by simple diffusion, {{as is the case in}} mice, although channel processes are also involved in the movement. On the other hand, water appears to move through <b>morulae</b> and blastocysts predominantly by facilitated diffusion via channels, as in mice. Like water, cryoprotectants appear to move through bovine oocytes/early embryos mostly by simple diffusion, but channel processes could also be involved in the movement of glycerol and ethylene glycol, unlike that in mice. In bovine <b>morulae,</b> although glycerol and ethylene glycol would move predomi-nantly by facilitated diffusion, mostly through AQP 3, as in mice, dimethylsulfoxide appears to move predominantly by simple diffusion, unlike in mice.
