50|$|A common {{measure of}} the quality of the power {{produced}} by an RPC or any phase converter is the voltage balance, which may be measured while the RPC is driving a balanced load such as a three-phase motor. Other quality measures include the harmonic content of the power produced and the power factor of the RPC <b>motor</b> <b>combination</b> as seen by the utility. Selection of the best phase converter for any application depends on the sensitivity of the load to these factors. Three-phase induction motors are very sensitive to voltage imbalances.|$|E
50|$|The {{installation}} {{and integration of}} variable frequency drives can lower the energy consumption of the building's circulation pumps to about 15% {{of what they had}} been using before. A variable frequency drive functions by modulating the frequency of the electricity provided to the motor that it powers. In the USA, the electrical grid uses a frequency of 60 Hertz or 60 cycles per second. Variable frequency drives are able to decrease the output and energy consumption of motors by lowering the frequency of the electricity provided to the motor, however the relationship between motor output and energy consumption is not a linear one. If the variable frequency drive provides electricity to the motor at 30 Hertz, the output of the motor will be 50% because 30 Hertz divided by 60 Hertz is 0.5 or 50%. The energy consumption of a motor running at 50% or 30 Hertz will not be 50%, but will instead be something like 18% because the relationship between motor output and energy consumption are not linear. The exact ratios of motor output or Hertz provided to the motor (which are effectively the same thing), and the actual energy consumption of the variable frequency drive / <b>motor</b> <b>combination</b> depend on the efficiency of the variable frequency drive. For example, because the variable frequency drive needs power itself to communicate with the building automation system, run its cooling fan, etc., if the motor always ran at 100% with the variable frequency drive installed the cost of operation or electricity consumption would actually go up with the new variable frequency drive installed. The amount of energy that variable frequency drives consume is nominal and is hardly worth consideration when calculating savings, however it did need to be noted that VFD's do consume energy themselves. Because the variable frequency drives rarely ever run at 100% and {{spend most of their time}} in the 40% output range, and because now the pumps completely shut down when not needed, the variable frequency drives have reduced the energy consumption of the pumps to around 15% of what they had been using before.|$|E

40|$|National Aerospace Laboratories {{is having}} major program to develop Micro Air Vehicles (MAV) for defence use. The present {{configuration}} of NAL MAV propulsion system is battery driven miniature motor and propellers. From the basic configuration for smooth hand launch, it is defined that the maximum weight of NAL {{micro air vehicle}} {{would be limited to}} 300 gms with a minimum thrust requirement of 120 gms and thrust to weight ratio would being 0. 40. Indigenous design and development of miniature propeller for NAL MAV program is carried out and to be evaluated for its performance which includes Structural analysis using ANSYS 11 and fabrication of propeller using CFRP. Commercially available propellers and motors also have minimum information (often with no information) which makes it difficult to select the efficient combinations of propeller and motor. A test setup designed and built for the purpose at propulsion division is used to evaluate the static performance of <b>motor</b> propeller <b>combinations</b> at different operating and at uninstalled conditions. The same test setup is also used in low speed wind tunnel for evaluating overall performance propeller-motor combinations. Else where like University of Illinois has set up a test rig for evaluating the static performance of micro propellers where in thrust, torque and rotational speeds are measured. The test setup has beam type load cell having capacity up to 600 gms for measuring thrust and brushless electric motors for powering the propellers. Thrust, power, rotational speeds, weight of the propeller as well motors are measured. In the present test set up direct torque measurement is not envisaged. Propellers static thrust is evaluated using 4 electrical brushless <b>motors</b> <b>combinations</b> for optimizing the power consumption. Based on minimum thrust requirement, highest power consumed by the motor and its weight are used to eliminate and select relatively better <b>motor</b> propeller <b>combinations.</b> Finally selected propeller-motor combinations are used for evaluation in the low speed wind tunnel. Literature survey indicates that fabrication of propeller using Eppler- 193; using metal thorough CNC and other methods have limited success due to its thin section. Successfully made one with using acrylic material. Fabrication of propeller using CFRP material and mould was tried and abandoned due to problem faced during machining of mould. We are able to design, fabricate one using CFRP and test it successfully. Propellers of pitch to diameter ratio closer to 0. 5 found to give more static thrust. This report gives the details of propeller-motor selection procedures, experimental test setup, instrumentation, motor specification, propeller specification, evaluation methods and static test data of propeller <b>motor</b> <b>combinations.</b> Wind tunnel testing has been carried out at different wind speeds for evaluating the performance of the propeller-motor combinations selected under uninstalled condition.

40|$|A {{testing program}} was {{undertaken}} at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and an electric utility (Pacific Gas and Electric Co.) {{to compare the}} performance of furnace blowers. This laboratory testing program was undertaken to support potential changes to California Building Standards regarding in-field furnace blower energy use.

40|$|Although {{purified}} cytoskeletal motor proteins {{have been}} studied extensively {{with the use of}} in vitro approaches, a generic approach to selectively probe actin and microtubule-based motor protein activity inside living cells is lacking. To examine specific motor activity inside living cells, we utilized the FKBP-rapalog-FRB heterodimerization system to develop an in vivo peroxisomal trafficking assay that allows inducible recruitment of exogenous and endogenous kinesin, dynein, and myosin motors to drive specific cargo transport. We demonstrate that cargo rapidly redistributes with distinct dynamics for each respective motor, and that combined (antagonistic) actions of more complex <b>motor</b> <b>combinations</b> can also be probed. Of importance, robust cargo redistribution is readily achieved by one type of motor protein and does not require the presence of opposite-polarity motors. Simultaneous live-cell imaging of microtubules and kinesin or dynein-propelled peroxisomes, combined with high-resolution particle tracking, revealed that peroxisomes frequently pause at microtubule intersections. Titration and washout experiments furthermore revealed that motor recruitment by rapalog-induced heterodimerization is dose-dependent but irreversible. Our assay directly demonstrates that robust cargo motility does not require the presence of opposite-polarity motors, and can therefore be used to characterize the motile properties of specific types of motor proteins...|$|R

40|$|The Nebraska Center for Energy Sciences Research (NCER) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) {{strives to}} be energy {{efficient}} through Green Energy. Of course, in meeting {{some of the}} requirements for different types of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, certain minimum levels of energy efficiency practices must be met. One such level of energy efficiency, in particular, is reduction in the consumption of electrical energy in buildings. This thesis is a study of methods of reducing the consumption of electrical energy (measured in kW of electrical power) in the UNL Jorgensen Hall (JH) air handling unit 2 (AHU 2) ‘fan wall’ of supply air AC motors/fans. An analysis of the experimental {{results showed that the}} numerical values obtained for the total head loss (and the consequential power loss) from the equations employed in each energy method were sufficiently close to each other. This led {{to the conclusion that the}} equations employed in the energy methods were properly constructed. A comparison was made between the magnitudes of the head losses (and consequential power losses) associated with the work done by different motor combinations. Furthermore, this comparison was made while, in every combination, the AC motors were operating at a specific speed to move a mass of air through the AHU 2 intake air duct system. The optimal performance of the AHU 2 supply air AC motors was achieved through this comparison. The specific power consumption, for every different AHU 2 supply air AC <b>motor</b> <b>combination</b> tested, was also taken into consideration in order to determine the combined optimum level of performance for these motors in every setting. The effects of friction factor on major and minor head losses and consequently on total head loss were considered. A scheme was constructed for the linear optimization of the curve for the total head loss against major head loss. It was also concluded that a particular function developed to describe the relationship between friction factor and Reynolds number is not the only relationship through which friction factor can be determined. Friction factor can be determined independent of Reynolds number. Finally, recommendations were made so as to bring about the transitioning from one <b>motor</b> <b>combination</b> to another as smoothly as practical in order to meet the specific air supply requirements in different seasonal weather conditions. This can be achieved by way of modifying the appropriate segments of an energy management system software program in constant communication with (field) controllers at all times in order to command these AC motors (operating in different combinations) to run as closely as possible to their peak efficiencies only within a rather narrow range of speed and switching them on and off as needed at all times.
