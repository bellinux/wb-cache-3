25|$|Many {{dogs were}} used to locate mines. They did not prove to be very {{effective}} under combat conditions. Marine <b>mine</b> <b>detecting</b> <b>dogs</b> were trained using bare electric wires beneath the ground surface. The wires shocked the dogs, teaching them that danger lurked under the dirt. Once the dog's focus was properly directed, dummy mines were planted and the dogs were trained to signal their presence. While the dogs effectively found the mines, the task proved so stressful for the dogs they were only able to work between 20 and 30 minutes at a time. The <b>mine</b> <b>detecting</b> war <b>dogs</b> anticipated random shocks from the heretofore friendly earth, making them extremely nervous. The useful service life of the dogs was not long. Experiments with lab rats show that this trend can be very extreme, in some tests rats even huddled in the corner {{to the point of}} starvation to avoid electric shock.|$|R

Each dog handler was given four dogs to train, {{and at the end}} of the course, the trainer selected the best one and shipped out. Dogs were trained for sentry, attack, scout, and messenger roles, and later to <b>detect</b> <b>mines.</b> 1,200 <b>dogs</b> could be accommodated at any one time.|$|R

Humanitarian demining is a very urgent and necessary activity {{to be carried out}} in landmine affected countries. Most of the land mine affected countries are developing Asian and African countries.

40|$|This paper proposes {{the design}} of a {{micro-controller}} based fuzzy logic controller for a remote controlled <b>mine</b> <b>detecting</b> robot. In the real time applications the detection and location of bomb is highly essential in the field of defense applications. Considering the value of human life the robot is allowed in the field to detect the bomb. The <b>mine</b> <b>detecting</b> robot is designed with IR sensors, metal detector and GPS attached to it. The two DC motors are connected with the rear wheels of the robot. Differential drive is used to control the steering angle and the speed of the robot. Differential drive is a method of controlling a robot with only two motorized wheels. They are controlled by a fuzzy logic controller to offer accurate steering angle and the driving speed of the robot. The designed controller has two loops with an Outer Fuzzy Speed Control Loop and an Inner Current Control Loop. Based on the current position and the set speed value, the steering angle and the speed of a <b>mine</b> <b>detecting</b> robot will be controlled. The software for both the client system and the robot is developed using Data socket protocol in LabVIEW. The motion of the robot is monitored by RF camera. The designed controller was implemented in a PIC 16 F 877 A microcontroller and the results are documented. The <b>mine</b> is <b>detected</b> by metal detector and the area of the mine is known through GPS...|$|R

50|$|The Mine Kafon Drone is a drone for demining, led by Afghanistan-born Massoud Hassani.

The U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program uses military dolphins and sea lions for underwater sentry duty, mine clearance, and object recovery.On land, giant pouched rats such as the Gambian giant pouched rat have been tested with considerable success as specialised <b>mine</b> <b>detecting</b> animals, as their keen sense of smell helps in the identification of explosives and their small size prevents them from triggering land mines.|$|R
50|$|Later, some ships survived mine blasts, limping into port with buckled {{plates and}} broken backs.

Ships that had successfully run the gauntlet of the Atlantic crossing were sometimes destroyed entering freshly cleared British harbours.

50|$|The M93 uses both seismic and {{acoustic}} {{sensors to}} track and identify potential targets near the mine. Once the <b>mine</b> <b>detects</b> a suitable target in range, the mine turns to face the target and elevates the submunition launcher to the correct angle.

When the target is detected the submunition triggers a Misznay Schardin effect warhead that projects a 450 gram tantalum slug, along with a number of smaller fragments downwards towards the target in a top attack.|$|R
