5000|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, {{there were at}} least ten {{companies}} in the United States manufacturing musical saws. These saws ranged from the familiar steel variety to gold-plated masterpieces worth hundreds of dollars. However, with the start of World War II the demand for metals made the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> saws <b>too</b> expensive and many of these companies went out of business. By the year 2000, only three companies in the United States—Mussehl & Westphal, Charlie Blacklock, and Wentworth—were making saws. In 2012, a company called Index Drums started producing a saw that had a built-in transducer in the handle, called the [...] "JackSaw".|$|R
60|$|Here we see {{the first}} of the great serge <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> Devonshire--a trade <b>too</b> great to be {{described}} in miniature, as it must be if I undertake it here, and which takes up this whole county, which is the largest and most populous in England, Yorkshire excepted (which ought to be esteemed three counties, and is, indeed, divided as such into the East, West, and North Riding). But Devonshire, one entire county, is so full of great towns, and those towns so full of people, and those people so universally employed in trade and manufactures, that not only it cannot be equalled in England, but perhaps not in Europe.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{sessions}} were completed, Porcell and Siegler {{listened to the}} finished mixes while on the Youth of Today European tour {{and came to the}} conclusion that while the performances were good, the recordings were not up to the standards of what they had done in the past with Youth of Today. The drum tracks in particular do not have the punch typical of other Revelation releases at the time, and the overall mix is considered to be thin. A phone call to lead singer Mike [...] "Judge" [...] Ferarro confirmed that he too was unhappy with the finished album, and the group chose to shelve the session and start over in a different studio. Unfortunately for Revelation, label owner Jordan Cooper had already paid for the mastering of the record and the plating of the vinyl stampers - a point in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> record <b>too</b> late to fully prevent the release of an album, especially for Revelation Records, which was then still a small independent label that Cooper was running out of his home.|$|R
