5|$|Beer {{ranges from}} less than 3% alcohol by volume (abv) to around 14% abv, though this {{strength}} can be increased to around 20% by re-pitching with champagne yeast, and to 55% abv by the freeze-distilling process. The alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style. The pale lagers that <b>most</b> <b>consumers</b> are familiar with fall {{in the range of}} 4–6%, with a typical abv of 5%. The customary strength of British ales is quite low, with many session beers being around 4% abv. Some beers, such as table beer are of such low alcohol content (1%–4%) that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools.|$|E
5|$|According to Larousse Gastronomique, the durian {{fruit is}} ready to eat when its husk begins to crack. However, the ideal stage of {{ripeness}} to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of D. zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in northern Thailand, the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic. In Malaysia and Singapore, <b>most</b> <b>consumers</b> prefer the fruit to be as ripe and pungent in aroma as possible and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic, the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.|$|E

25|$|The first Christmas {{tree farm}} was {{established}} in 1901, but <b>most</b> <b>consumers</b> continued to obtain their trees from forests until the 1930s and 1940s. Christmas tree farming was once seen only as a viable alternative for low-quality farmland, but that perception has changed within the agriculture industry. For optimum yield and quality, land should be flat or gently rolling and relatively free of debris and undergrowth.|$|E
25|$|Most Popular (and incompatible) step-in systems used {{unique and}} {{proprietary}} mechanisms, {{such as the}} step-ins produced by Burton, Rossignol and Switch. Shimano and K2 used a technology similar to clipless bicycle pedals. Burton and K2 Clicker step-in binding systems {{are no longer in}} production as both companies have opted to focus on the strap-in binding system. Rossignol remains as the sole provider of step-in binding systems and offers them primarily to the rental market as <b>most</b> <b>consumers</b> and retailers alike have been discouraged by lack of adequate development and industry support for step-in technology.|$|E
25|$|A {{representative}} {{survey of}} consumers {{carried out in}} December 2007 showed that <b>most</b> <b>consumers</b> believe prices are too high. However, it also showed that they overestimate the price of water (Euro 4.80/m3 instead of the actual average price of Euro 3.02/m3). Interestingly, 55% of the French population believe that treated wastewater is directly being reused as drinking water, {{which is not the}} case. The survey also shows that 84% of French consumers trust that the quality of their tap water is good. 67% declare that they drink water from the tap at least once a week. Those who are dissatisfied about tap water quality complain mainly about high levels of chlorine and calcium carbonate.|$|E

25|$|Consumers {{typically}} have positive attitudes for {{products that are}} ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All fair trade products must meet standards such as these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products including fair trade commodities, consumers often {{are not willing to}} pay the higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can say {{they would be willing to}} pay a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but <b>most</b> <b>consumers</b> are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee. Once enough consumers begin purchasing fair trade, companies are more likely to carry fair trade products. Safeway Inc. began carrying fair trade coffee after individual consumers dropped off postcards asking for it.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Most</b> <b>consumers</b> {{agree that}} while {{achieving}} business targets, companies should do CSR {{at the same}} time. <b>Most</b> <b>consumers</b> believe companies doing charity work will receive a positive response. Somerville also found that consumers are loyal and willing to spend more on retailers that support charity. Consumers also believe that retailers selling local products will gain loyalty. Smith (2013) shares the belief that marketing local products will gain consumer trust. However, environmental efforts are receiving negative views given the belief that this would affect customer service. Oppewal et al. (2006) found that not all CSR activities are attractive to consumers. They recommended that retailers focus on one activity. Becker-Olsen (2006) [...] found that if the social initiative done by the company is not aligned with other company goals {{it will have a}} negative impact. Mohr et al. (2001) and Groza et al. (2011) also emphasise the importance of reaching the consumer.|$|E

[...] In marketing research, the association found that <b>most</b> <b>consumers</b> believed the San Antonio Brewing Association encompassed {{more than a single}} brewery; in fact, the public thought San Antonio Brewing Association referred to all brewing in San Antonio in general. [...] Therefore, in 1952 the San Antonio Brewing Association changed its name to the Pearl Brewing Company (1952–present).|$|E
2500|$|All of the {{previous}} releases from The Bodyguard had been successes, landing in the top five. [...] "Run to You" [...] became a moderate hit, peaking at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the US, it spent six weeks inside the top 40, five of which were spent at the number 31 peak. Airplay and singles sales topped out at number 26 and 41, respectively. The single sales stalled at number 41 on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart, most likely {{due to the fact}} its parent album, The Bodyguard, already was certified 8× platinum and nearing 9× platinum status quickly. Single sales were moderate because <b>most</b> <b>consumers</b> already owned the song by simply owning the album.|$|E

2500|$|Though [...] "Run to You" [...] {{is one of}} Houston's most {{recognized}} songs worldwide, {{the chart}} performance was not as successful as her previous hit singles' {{at the time of}} its release, due to the fact its parent album, The Bodyguard soundtrack, had already sold 21 million copies globally at that point and <b>most</b> <b>consumers</b> had the song by simply owning the soundtrack. In the United States, [...] "Run to You" [...] debuted at number 83 and 76 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R Singles charts, in the issue dated June 26, 1993, respectively. Three weeks later the single reached its peak position of number 31 on both the charts in the July 17, 1993 issue. On the Hot 100, the song spent six weeks inside the Top 40, five of which were stayed at its number 31 peak from July 17 to August 14, 1993. In addition, it peaked at number 41 and 26 on the component charts of the Hot 100, the Hot 100 Singles Sales and the Hot 100 Airplay, respectively. The song also peaked at number 10 on the Hot Adult Contemporary chart, becoming Houston's 17th Top 10 hit of the chart. In Canada, the song debuted at number 86 on the RPM 100 Hits Tracks chart, the issue dated July 10, 1993. The next week it leaped to number 34 on the chart and reached the Top 20 in its fourth week of release.
