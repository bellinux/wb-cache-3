5|$|The horses, {{especially}} young foals and juveniles, provide a major food {{source in the}} southern Namib Desert for the spotted hyena, along with gemsbok and springbok. However, the availability of other food {{appears to have a}} significant influence on predation rates among the horses. Leopards and black-backed jackals also predate young horses, although this is more rare. The harsh environmental conditions in which they live are the main driver of mortality among the Namib Desert Horse, as they cause dehydration, malnutrition, exhaustion and lameness. Other large plains animals, including the <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra,</b> may have once sporadically utilized the area for grazing during periods of excess rainfall, but human interference (including fencing off portions of land and hunting) have eliminated or significantly reduced the movement of these animals in the area. The endangered Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> does exist in the Naukluft <b>Mountain</b> <b>Zebra</b> Park portion of the Namib-Naukluft Park, but their range does not intersect with that of the Namib Desert Horse.|$|E
5|$|Besides the horse, {{there are}} seven other species of genus Equus in the Equidae family. These are the ass or donkey, Equus asinus; the <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra,</b> Equus zebra; plains zebra, Equus quagga; Grévy's zebra, Equus grevyi; the kiang, Equus kiang; and the onager, Equus hemionus.|$|E
5|$|Quaggas {{have been}} {{reported}} gathering into herds of 30–50 individuals and sometimes travelled in a linear fashion. They may have been sympatric with Burchell's zebra between the Vaal and Orange rivers. This is disputed, {{and there is no}} evidence that they interbred. It could also have shared a small portion of its range with Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> (Equus zebra hartmannae).|$|E
50|$|There are lion-tailed macaques, {{squirrel}} monkeys, ring-tailed lemurs, lions, leopards, coyotes, ostrichs, Hartman's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras,</b> reticulated giraffes, southern cassowaries and emus.|$|R
50|$|Against the {{northern}} hillside are six larges enclosures for dholes, lions, Bengal tigers, Barbary sheep, Nubian ibexes and Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras</b> respectively.|$|R
50|$|Black rhinos were {{extinguished}} in {{the area}} in 1983, but they have been reintroduced. Other species found in Kaokoland include oryxes, kudus, springboks, ostrichs, giraffes and <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras.</b>|$|R
5|$|Wild equines {{may spend}} seven {{hours a day}} sleeping. During the day, they sleep {{standing}} up while at night they lie down. They regularly rub against trees, rocks and other objects and roll in around in dust for protection against flies and irritation. Except the <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra,</b> wild equines can roll over completely.|$|E
5|$|Later {{morphological}} studies came to conflicting conclusions. A 1999 {{analysis of}} cranial measurements {{found that the}} quagga was as different from the plains zebra as the latter is from the <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra.</b> A 2004 study of skins and skulls instead suggested that the quagga was not a distinct species, but a subspecies of the plains zebra. In spite of these findings, many authors subsequently kept the plains zebra and the quagga as separate species.|$|E
5|$|The quagga was {{the first}} extinct animal to have its DNA analysed, and this 1984 study {{launched}} the field of ancient DNA analysis. It confirmed that the quagga was {{more closely related to}} zebras than to horses, with the quagga and <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> (Equus zebra) sharing an ancestor 3–4 million years ago. An immunological study published the following year found the quagga to be closest to the plains zebra. A 1987 study suggested that the mtDNA of the quagga diverged at a range of roughly 2% per million years, similar to other mammal species, and again confirmed the close relation to the plains zebra.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mountain</b> <b>zebras</b> {{are found}} on {{mountain}} slopes, open grasslands, woodlands and areas with sufficient vegetation, but their preferred habitat is mountainous terrain, especially escarpment with {{a diversity of}} grass species.|$|R
50|$|Until 1966, {{the shield}} was {{flanked by two}} ostrich feathers. They were {{replaced}} with two <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras,</b> as supporters. The crest was a cornucopia and the motto was Perseverantia vincit.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the species}} kept here are, American bison, hooded cranes, red-crowned cranes, white-naped crane, maned wolves, cheetahs, a mariana crow, black-footed ferrets, persian onagers, Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras</b> and scimitar-horned oryxs.|$|R
5|$|Humans {{have had}} {{a great impact on}} the populations of wild equines. Threats to wild equines include habitat {{destruction}} and conflicts with local people and livestock. Since the 20th century, wild equines have been decimated over many of their former ranges and their populations scattered. In recent centuries, two subspecies, the quagga and the tarpan, became extinct. Only the plains zebra remains numerous and widespread. The IUCN lists the African wild ass as critically endangered, the Grévy's zebra, <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> and Przewalski's horse as endangered, the Onager as vulnerable, the kiang as lower risk and the plains zebra as least concern. The Przewalski's horse was considered to be extinct in the wild from the 1960s to 1996. However, following successful captive breeding, it has been reintroduced in Mongolia.|$|E
5|$|A dun-colored {{coat with}} {{primitive}} markings {{that include a}} dorsal stripe and often leg striping and transverse shoulder stripes reflect the wildtype coat and are observed in most wild extant equine species. Only the <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> lacks a dorsal stripe. In domestic horses, dun color and primitive markings exist in some animals across many breeds. The purpose of the bold black-and-white striping of zebras has been a subject of debate among biologists for over a century, but recent (2014) evidence supports the theory {{that they are a}} form of protection from biting flies. These insects appear to be less attracted to striped coats and, compared to other wild equines, zebras live in areas with the highest fly activity. With the exception of the domestic horses, which have long manes that lay over the neck and long tail hair growing {{from the top of the}} tailhead or dock, most equines have erect manes and long tails ending in a tuft of hair. The coats of some equine species undergo shedding in certain parts of their range and are thick in the winter.|$|E
5|$|Extant wild equines have {{scattered}} ranges across Africa and Asia. The plains zebra {{lives in}} lush grasslands and savannas of Eastern and Southern Africa, while the <b>Mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> inhabits mountainous areas of southwest Africa. The other equine species tend to occupy more arid environments with more scattered vegetation. The Grévy's zebra {{is found in}} thorny scrubland of East Africa, while the African wild ass inhabits rocky deserts of North Africa. The two Asian wild ass species live in the dry deserts of the Near East and Central Asia and the Przwelski's wild horse's habitat is the deserts of Mongolia. Only {{the range of the}} plains and Grévy's zebras overlap. In addition to wild populations, domesticated horses and donkeys are widespread thanks to humans. In certain parts of the world, populations of feral horses and feral donkeys exist, which are descended from domesticated animals that were released or escaped into the wild.|$|E
50|$|Adult <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras</b> have a head-and-body {{length of}} 2.1 to 2.6 m and a tail of 40 to 55 cm long. Shoulder height ranges from 1.16 to 1.5 m. They weigh from 204 to 372 kg.|$|R
50|$|The drought {{that began}} in the year 1980 {{resulted}} in the largest capture and culling operation {{in the history of the}} park. 2235 <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras</b> and 450 plains zebras were captured, culled or sold. 525 elephants were culled and processed at a temporary abattoir near Olifantsrus.|$|R
50|$|The Palmwag Nature Reserve is in Northern Namibia {{and covers}} {{an area of}} 400,000 ha. The reserve has the largest {{population}} of black rhinos in Africa; a local organisation called Save the Rhino Trust protects them. Some of the wildlife reported are; leopards, lions, cheetas, <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras,</b> giraffes, springboks, kudus, and desert elephants.|$|R
5|$|Since the {{practical}} function of striping {{has not been}} determined for zebras in general, it is unclear why the quagga lacked stripes on its hind parts. A cryptic function for protection from predators (stripes obscure the individual zebra in a herd) and biting flies (which are less attracted to striped objects), as well as various social functions, have been proposed for zebras in general. Differences in hind quarter stripes may have aided species recognition during stampedes of mixed herds, so that members of one subspecies or species would follow its own kind. It has also been evidence that the zebras developed striping patterns as thermoregulation to cool themselves down, and that the quagga lost them due to living in a cooler climate, although one problem with {{this is that the}} <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> lives in similar environments and has a bold striping pattern. A 2014 study strongly supported the biting-fly hypothesis, and the quagga appears to have lived in areas with lesser amounts of fly activity compared to other zebras.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a dispute}} among {{biologists}} {{as to how}} to properly classify the various species of zebra. It is thought that the plains zebra and <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> belong to the subgenus Hippotigris and that Grévy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus. This is on account of Grévy's zebra resembling an ass (subgenus Asinus), while the plains zebra and <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> are more horse-like. All three animals belong to the genus Equus along with other living equids. However, recent phylogenetic evidence finds that plains zebras are more closely related to Grévy's zebras than mountain zebras. In areas where plains zebras are sympatric with Grévy's zebras, it is not unusual to find them in the same herds and fertile hybrids occur. In captivity, plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras. The hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern.|$|E
25|$|Of equids {{other than}} horses, all except the <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> show a {{distinct}} dorsal stripe. Among domesticated donkeys, most {{have a black}} dorsal stripe, though {{it can be difficult}} to see on melanistic individuals. In the African wild ass, the dorsal stripe is thin but distinct and black. In Przewalski's horse, the dorsal stripe is usually dark brown, while it is black in the bred-back tarpan. In the plains zebra, the dorsal stripe is narrow and edged by white, while in Grevy's zebra, it is quite bold. The dorsal stripes of the onager and kiang are dark brown and especially vivid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mountain</b> <b>zebras</b> live in hot, dry, rocky, mountainous and hilly habitats. They prefer {{slopes and}} {{plateaus}} {{as high as}} 1000 m above sea level, although they do migrate lower during winter. Their preferred diet is tufted grass, but in times of shortage they will browse, eating bark, twigs, leaves, buds, fruit, and roots.|$|R
50|$|As part of {{conservation}} programs, the Utica Zoo has housed Mexican wolves, red pandas, white-naped cranes, white-handed gibbons, Mexican spider monkeys, golden lion tamarins, golden-headed lion tamarins, California sea lions, prehensile-tailed skinks, collard peccaries and snowy owls. Its current collection includes African lions, Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras,</b> and California sea lions, and the petting zoo features Nigerian dwarf goats.|$|R
5000|$|The Naukluft Mountains (Afrikaans and German: Naukluftberge) are a {{mountain}} range in central Namibia. The {{southern part of}} the mountain range forms the easternmost part of the Namib-Naukluft National Park. The northern mountains are occupied by privately held farms. They are known for their wildlife, including <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras</b> and leopards. The mountains have many small streams and waterfalls.|$|R
500|$|Living in {{the very}} {{southern}} end of the plains zebra's range, the quagga had a thick winter coat that moulted each year. Its skull was described as having a straight profile and a [...] diastema, and as being relatively broad with a narrow occiput. Like other plains zebras, the quagga did not have a dewlap on its neck as the <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> does. The 2004 morphological study found that the skeletal features of the southern Burchell's zebra population and the quagga overlapped, and that they were impossible to distinguish. Some specimens also appeared to be intermediate between the two in striping, and individuals of the extant Burchell's zebra population still exhibit limited striping. It can therefore be concluded that the two subspecies graded morphologically into each other. Today, some stuffed specimens of quaggas and southern Burchell's zebra are so similar that they are impossible to definitely identify as either, since no location data was recorded. The female specimens used in the study were larger than the males on average.|$|E
500|$|The caracal is {{typically}} nocturnal (active at night), though some activity may be observed {{during the day}} as well. However, the cat is so secretive and difficult to observe that its activity at daytime might easily go unnoticed. A study in South Africa showed that caracals are most active when air temperature drops below activity typically ceases at higher temperatures. A solitary cat, the caracal mainly occurs alone or in pairs; the only group seen is of mothers with their offspring. Females in oestrus will temporarily pair with males. A territorial animal, the caracal marks rocks and vegetation in its territory with urine and probably with dung, which is not covered with soil. Claw scratching is prominent, and dung middens are typically not formed. In Israel, males are found to have territories averaging , while that of females averaged [...] The male territories vary from [...] in Saudi Arabia. In <b>Mountain</b> <b>Zebra</b> National Park (South Africa), the female territories vary between [...] These territories overlap extensively. The conspicuous ear tufts and the facial markings often serve {{as a method of}} visual communication; caracals have been observed interacting with each other by moving the {{head from side to side}} so that the tufts flicker rapidly. Like other cats, the caracal meows, growls, hisses, spits and purrs.|$|E
50|$|The Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> {{is one of}} two {{geographically}} separated subspecies of {{the species}} Equus zebra (<b>mountain</b> <b>zebra),</b> the other being Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> (Equus zebra hartmannae).The Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> was once was regarded as a separate species from Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> based on taxonomic evidence, but recent genomic evidence has led to the two populations now being reclassified as subspecies of Equus zebra.|$|E

500|$|The name [...] "quagga" [...] {{is derived}} from the Khoikhoi word for zebra and is onomatopoeic, being said to {{resemble}} the quagga's call, variously transcribed as [...] "kwa-ha-ha", [...] "kwahaah", or [...] "oug-ga". The name is still used colloquially for the plains zebra. The quagga was originally classified as a distinct species, Equus quagga, in 1778 by Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert. Traditionally, the quagga and the other plains and <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras</b> were placed in the subgenus Hippotigris.|$|R
