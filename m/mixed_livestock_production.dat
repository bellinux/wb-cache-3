40|$|Crofting {{is a low}} {{intensity}} {{agricultural system}} restricted to the Highlands and Islands of northern Scotland typified by small scale <b>mixed</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> and rotational cropping activities. As with other low intensity farming systems across Europe, crofting is changing {{in response to a}} range of socio-economic factors. This is having a negative impact on the populations of rare bumblebees that are associated with this agricultural system. In this paper we use an ecologicalâ€“economic modelling approach to examine the likely impacts of introducing two different management options for conserving bumblebees on croft land-use and income. Two linear programming models were constructed to represent the predominant crofting systems found in the Outer Hebrides, and varying constraints on bumblebee abundance were imposed to examine the trade-off between conservation and agricultural incomes. The model outputs illustrate that in some instances it is likely that both agricultural profits and bumblebee densities can be enhanced. We conclude that policy-makers should take into consideration the type of farming system when designing cost-effective agri-environment policies for low intensity farming systems, and that improvements in bee conservation are not necessarily in conflict with maintaining farm inco...|$|E
40|$|This study uses a {{disaggregated}} input-output (IO) {{table of}} Sweden {{to assess the}} economic impacts of different production lines within Swedish agriculture. Focus has especially {{been placed on the}} differences between different types of livestock production and the differences between livestock and arable productions. Swedish agriculture was divided into the production lines, or sectors, cattle (milk and beef), pig, poultry and egg, sheep, <b>mixed</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>production,</b> cereals and mixed farm production, and the importance and potential of each one of them were assessed. To enable such a detailed analysis we first developed and applied a method for disaggregating the single agricultural account in the Swedish IO table. To do so we disaggregated the inputs and outputs of all production lines identified in the study. We used farm accounting data for Sweden together with sector specific data from Statistics Sweden and Agriwise to determine the purchases and sales of different farm types. Within the so called Make-Use framework of the IO table we allowed different farm types to produce more than one output to take the normal heterogeneity of farm production into consideration. Turning the IO table into an IO model we analyzed the various interdependencies in the economic system and determined the relative impact and potentials of different sectors. In particular, output, employment and income multipliers, together with elasticities were calculated and analyzed. In this process we developed the already existing measure of elasticities to better capture the relative importance of sectors with limited final demand. Livestock production lines are generally more integrated in the system of intermediate sales and purchases compared with cereal production. This means that these production lines offer a greater potential in generating output throughout the economy, if the final demand for these products was to increase exogenously. Among the livestock production lines, poultry and egg production seem to be the most input-intensive; however this production line uses labour to a small extent. Combining the multipliers with the relative size of production lines to derive measures of elasticities we find that significant production lines are cattle (milk and beef), cereals and mixed farming. The output, employment and income multipliers, as well as the elasticities, calculated in this study offer a basis for decisions related to sector priorities and regional and rural development. It is however utterly important that the results are interpreted in the right way and that the reader understands that production lines with great output generating potential might for example not perform as well in generating employment. Furthermore generating employment can be measured from different perspectives. That is, a sector can generate employment from one more person employed in the sector or from exogenous increase in the demand for the product of the production line. Results might differ substantially. Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|E
40|$|Many {{bumblebee}} {{species have}} experienced severe population declines {{in response to}} the use of intensive land management practices throughout the UK and western Europe during {{the latter half of the}} twentieth century. The loss of wildflower-rich unimproved lowland grasslands has been particularly detrimental and, as a result, in the UK two bumblebee species are now extinct, seven are listed on the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP), and only six extant species remain common and ubiquitous. Populations of the rarer species are often fragmented and restricted to isolated areas, such as the crofting regions of northwest Scotland, in which the use of intensive farming practices has remained relatively limited. Consequently, in this study I primarily focus on the conservation of B. distinguendus and B. muscorum, two of the UKâ€™s rarest species which have strongholds in the Outer Hebrides. In this region crofting is the dominant form of agriculture, and is traditionally typified by small-scale <b>mixed</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> accompanied by rotational cropping activities. With the use of very few artificial inputs, traditional crofting activities are environmentally sensitive and promote the diverse wildflower assemblages characteristic of the machair which provide suitable forage for bumblebees. However, the changing demographic structure of the islands, in conjunction with a range of other socio-economic factors, is resulting in the adoption of more intensive land management practices by crofters and changing the nature of the crofted landscape. These changes are likely to have a detrimental impact on the rare bumblebee populations that rely on crofting to provide suitable foraging habitats. Neglecting to examine the socio-economic issues behind the decline in crofting activities, and failure to develop a means of making the system economically viable and sustainable, is likely to reduce the effectiveness of any bumblebee conservation measures introduced in the region. Through my research I address this socio-ecological problem by taking an interdisciplinary approach, and combine the two disciplines of ecology and economics to find a way to ensure crofting is sustainable whilst promoting sympathetic land management practices to aid bumblebee conservation. The results of my research demonstrate that current croft land management practices do not support high abundances of foraging bumblebees in the Outer Hebrides, and that sheep grazing during the summer has a particularly negative impact on bumblebee abundance on croft land. My research also highlights the importance of non-agricultural habitats for foraging long-tongued bumblebee species in agricultural landscapes. Grazing management can promote bumblebee abundance, with cattle grazing providing a valuable foraging habitat for short-tongued bumblebees in southwest England. Therefore, to conserve bumblebees in agricultural landscapes the type of farming system needs to be taken into account in developing grazing management regimes, whilst non-agricultural habitats need to be integrated into local land management plans to ensure the provision of forage for bumblebees throughout the flight period. The outputs of the ecological-economic models show that compensation payments are not always required to encourage beneficial land management practices to enhance bumblebee populations in crofted areas. However, crofting is a marginal farming system that is heavily influenced by socio-economic factors, and this should be taken into consideration in the development of future agricultural policy for the region.

40|$|As {{calls for}} bolstering {{environmental}} services on croplands {{have grown more}} insistent {{during the past two}} decades, the search for ways to foster sustainable, reduced input agriculture has become more urgent. In this context we re-examine by means of a meta-analysis the argument, first proposed by Robert McC.

30|$|Changing {{management}} systems and lifestyles may also portend new hope for wildlife and pastoralists to co-exist. Some previously mobile pastoralists who {{were encouraged to}} become sedentary and take ownership of small parcels of land by governments (Mwangi and Ostrom 2009) are now aggregating their holdings and returning to patterns of seasonal migration more {{similar to those of}} the past (Mwangi 2007). Particularly in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, pastoral mobility affords a more resilient and potentially more productive livestock system and is less likely to cause land degradation than a more sedentary, year-round grazing regime (Western et al. 2009 a, b; Hesse and Cavanna 2010). In southern Kenya, wildlife populations fared far better where pastoral mobility was maintained compared to adjacent areas that were subdivided and settled (BurnSilver et al. 2008; Western et al. 2009 a, b), and sedentarization had <b>mixed</b> effects on <b>livestock</b> <b>production,</b> being particularly detrimental on low-productivity sites (Boone et al. 2005; BurnSilver et al. 2008). Although the KLEE experiment was not designed to ask questions about livestock mobility, it does provide one example of wildlife coexisting with cattle in an area where cattle are grazed episodically rather than continuously. Mobility may also help to create or maintain greater landscape heterogeneity and reduce dry-season competition between wild herbivores and livestock. The possibility that traditional management practices such as seasonal migration and deliberate burns may in time be reinstated raises many possibilities for a sustainable relationship among people, livestock, and wildlife.|$|R

The key challenges for the future of organic <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> in Europe are related to the feasibility of implementing improved husbandry inputs and the development of evidence-based decision support systems for health and feeding management.

40|$|Dehesas are an agrosilvopastoral {{system that}} has {{enhanced}} the maintenance of an extraordinarily high biodiversity. The traditional use is characterized by <b>mixed</b> <b>livestock</b> raising at low stocking densities, employment of hardy regional breeds and an elaborated maintenance and exploitation of holm oaks. <b>Livestock</b> <b>production</b> has traditionally been accompanied by arable systems with long rotations and closed nutrient cycles without external inputs of fodder, fertilizers and agro-chemicals. Modern trends are a specialization toward lamb and beef production and the employment of intensive techniques like free-range grazing at high stocking levels or crossbreeding with high-performance breeds. A model income statement shows that livestock create an income of 49. 91 US $ per ewe per year on an average basis. The central problem for {{the continuity of the}} dehesas is the gradual decay of the tree canopy. Intensification of agricultural production and the abandonment of traditional grazing practices additionally threaten biodiversity within the dehesas. The authors suggest the foundation of a biosphere reserve in Cuatro Lugares as a framework for a sustainable development of the dehesas...|$|R

The authors have made an important attempt to review a vast literature on global <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> systems. In my view this attempt by the authors to provide global perspectives of shifting <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> has benefitted many agencies (as is shown by the list of supporting institutions). The global and regional attention given to <b>livestock</b> sector <b>production</b> is therefore a welcome development. In volume 1 (which consists of 20 Chapters), the focus is on developed and developing countries. Global <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> is consumer driven, as the demand for food (particularly {{on the part of the}} growing urban populations) increases. By highlighting the different geographical dimensions of the production and the transfer of livestock-based production, the book aims to show linkages between the formal and informal market food chains. The emphasis is on environmental impacts. <b>Livestock</b> <b>production</b> and its impacts on the immediate environment is influenced by multiple drivers. The book identifies these drivers as population growth, shifts in technology and rising demand for human food and animal feed. All of these are responsible for a move from agriculture to <b>livestock</b> <b>production.</b> However, these developments have not been felt equally across the developed and developing countries and between low and high population density countries. Greater demands for higher calorific intake in such regions as South-East Asia and East Asia, which also have a higher consumption index, show them to be the main shifters when it comes to <b>livestock</b> <b>production.</b> In sub-Saharan Africa, with a negative consumptive calorific index, demand is lower. The book in Volume 1 outlines the different systems of <b>livestock</b> <b>production.</b> The gradients of <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> vary according to whether the system is extensive, mixed or intensive. Extensive systems, such as those practiced in the dry tropics, have low stocking rates and low quality feed from natural pastures. Extensive systems however require large grazing areas. The book shows that where the extensive systems break down because of land-use competition, the <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> system shifts to smaller-scale mixed systems, such as those found in agro-pastoral systems. These systems are practiced in the developing countries, while in the developed countries, with their greater demand for food, <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> tends to be intensive. In the intensive system, the economy of scale is more preferred to meet the increasing demands for livestock products than small scale units of production. These specialized systems rely on concentrate feed, and call for greater investment in technology and energy use.|$|R
