Barry is {{interrupted}} while visiting his mother's grave on her birthday and leaves as the Flash to battle the Top, Mirror <b>Master,</b> <b>Heat</b> Wave, Captain Cold, and Captain Boomerang at the Flash Museum. Professor Zoom later reveals this {{to have been a}} trap for the Flash, whom he will kill Flash along with thousands of others, and link Flash's name to the destruction. The Justice League shows up and defuses all the bombs that Zoom set and all the villains are arrested. Shaken by what transpired, and full of thoughts about his dead mother, Flash parts from his Justice League colleagues and chooses to be alone. The next day, Flash wakes up in a universe where history has happened differently. Here, he has none of his powers, his mother is alive, Iris is married to someone else, and a feud between Aquaman and Wonder Woman has triggered an all-out global war. Flash blames Professor Zoom for messing with the timeline. He enlists the help of Batman (Thomas Wayne, Bruce's father) to regain his speed. He does so by recreating the accident that gave him his powers. The first attempt fails, leaving Barry with third degree burns. the second attempt however is successful, with him fully regaining his speed. Barry then gathers up a band of heroes including Cyborg (a government agent), and the Shazam Kids (all of whom become one Captain Thunder when they all say the wizard Shazam's name together) to stop the war and restore the timeline. However, during a fight with Professor Zoom, Flash discovers that Zoom didn't do anything, and that it was him who altered time by going back and saving his mother. After Batman kills the evil speedster, Flash travels back and prevents himself from saving his mother, but once again fractures time, creating another alternate timeline which differs in subtler ways from the original. Barry is also in a better place with his mom's death, and is reunited with Iris. He also gives Batman (Bruce Wayne) a letter that Thomas asked him to deliver to his son.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of evaluation of the metallurgical quality of <b>master</b> <b>heat</b> ingots and of the identification of non-metallic inclusions (oxides of Al., Zr, Hf, Cr, etc.), which have been found in the shrinkage cavities formed in these ingots.

The specific nature of the melting process of nickel and cobalt alloys, carried out in vacuum induction furnaces, excludes the possibility of alloy refining and slag removal from the melt surface. Therefore, {{to improve the quality of}} castings (parts of aircraft engines), it is so important to evaluate the quality of ingots before charging them into the crucible of an induction furnace.

40|$|The first {{evidence}} of the dc Josephson effect dates back to 1963 when J. S. Rowell measured the diffraction pattern of the critical current flowing through a single superconducting tunnel junction subjected to an in-plane magnetic field. Interference of Josephson currents through two tunnel junctions connected in parallel was achieved one year later leading to the first ever superconducting quantum interferometer. The latter, together with Rowell's observations, constituted the unequivocal demonstration of the Josephson supercurrent-phase relation. Yet, the Josephson effect has further profound implications going beyond electrical transport, as the interplay between the Cooper condensate and unpaired electrons provides thermal flow through the junction with phase coherence as well. Here we report the first demonstration of quantum diffraction of a heat flux showing that a temperature-biased single Josephson junction is exploited as a diffractor for thermal currents. Specifically, thermal diffraction manifests itself with a peculiar modulation of the electron temperature in a small metallic electrode nearby-contacted to the junction when sweeping the magnetic flux Φ. Remarkably, the observed temperature dependence exhibits Φ-symmetry and a clear reminiscence with a Fraunhofer-like modulation pattern, as expected fingerprints for a quantum diffraction phenomenon. Our results confirm a pristine prediction of quantum heat transport and, joined with double-junction heat interferometry demonstrated in Nature 492, 401 (2012), exemplify the complementary and conclusive proof {{of the existence of}} phase-dependent thermal currents in Josephson-coupled superconductors. This approach combined with well-known methods for phase-biasing superconducting circuits provides with a novel tool for <b>mastering</b> <b>heat</b> fluxes at the nanoscale.

40|$|Heat {{dissipation}} is a {{very critical}} problem for designing nano-functional devices, including MoS 2 /Graphene heterojunctions. In this paper we investigate thermal transport in MoS 2 /Graphene hybrid nanosheets under various heating conditions, by using molecular dynamics simulation. Diverse transport processes and characteristics, depending on the conducting layers, are found in these structures. The thermal conductivities can be tuned by interlayer coupling, environment temperature and interlayer overlap. The highest thermal conductivity at room temperature is achieved as more than 5 times of that of single layer MoS 2 when both layers are heated and 100 % overlapped. Different transport mechanisms in the hybrid nanosheets are explained by phonon density of states, temperature distribution, and ITR.

40|$|In this thesis, {{components}} {{intended for}} vehicles {{in space and}} other extreme environments have been realized using microsystems technology to facilitate miniaturized, yet high-performing systems beneficial for small spacecraft and other vehicles with limited size and power. Cold gas thrusters commonly used on spacecraft basically accelerate a gaseous propellant stored under high pressure. When miniaturized, their performance is reduced because of viscous forces. Here, with a special masking and etching scheme, making silicon micronozzles close to rotationally symmetric, this shortcoming was mitigated as indicated by schlieren imaging of the rocket exhaust and a comparison with conventionally manufactured micronozzles with rectangular cross-sections. Schlieren imaging was also used to detect leakage, quantify thrust vector deviation, and measure shock cell periods in the exhaust. Correlation was made to operational conditions. Similarly operating zirconia thrusters with integrated heaters and flow sensors were developed to allow for higher operating temperature. Successful testing at 1000 °C, suggests that the propellant efficiency could be increased by 7. 5 %, and also makes them candidates for chemical propulsion. A silicon thruster operating in rarefied gas regimes was also developed. Being suspended in a silicon dioxide frame reducing heat losses, a total efficiency of 17 % was reached. Relating to the integrated micropropulsion systems, two types of flow sensors were developed. Through finite element modeling, the insertion of sensor fingers in the fluid was shown {{to be an interesting}} concept for high-pressure applications. Utilizing the same principle, a velocity sensor for a miniaturized submersible was developed. With a power consumption below 15  mW, it was able to measure directions with an accuracy of ± 8 º, and speed with an error less than 22 %. To enable high-speed optical communication between spacecraft, a Free Space Optics communication system, and particularly its dual-axis beam-steering actuator, was developed. Through thermal actuation, optical angles larger than 40 º were obtained. A lumped thermal model was used to study design changes, vacuum operation and feedback control.

One of the paired TLD crystals was then mailed to Baton Rouge and its entangled counterpart remained in Givarlais. The crystal in Baton Rouge (master) was then subjected to thermal stimulation which elicited a measurable light emission response in the counterpart (slave) under a photomultiplier in Givarlais.

The first young fitful leapings, the sudden, fierce, <b>mastering</b> <b>heat,</b> the long, steady sober burning, and then--that last flaming-up, that clutch back at its own vanished youth, the final eager flight of flame, before the ashes wintered it to nothing!

A strange haphazard thing was love--so spun between ecstacy and torture! A thing insidious, irresponsible, desperate. A flying sweetness, more poignant than anything on earth, more dark in origin and destiny. A thing without reason or coherence. A man's love-life--what say had he in {{the ebb and flow of}} it? No more than in the flights of autumn birds, swooping down, alighting here and there, passing on. The loves one left behind--even in a life by no means vagabond in love, as men's lives went!

A so-called love--that half-glamorous, yet sordid little meal of pleasure, which youth, however sensitive, must eat, it seems, some time or other with some young light of love--a glimpse of life that beforehand had seemed much and had meant little, save to leave him disillusioned with himself and sorry for his partner. And then the love that he could not, even after twenty years, bear to remember; that all-devouring summer passion, which in one night had gained all and lost all terribly, leaving on his soul a scar that could never be quite healed, leaving his spirit always a little lonely, haunted by the sense of what might have been. Of his share in that night of tragedy--that 'terrible accident on the river'--no one had ever dreamed. And then the long despair which had seemed the last death of love had slowly passed, and yet another love had been born--or rather born again, pale, sober, but quite real; the fresh springing-up of a feeling long forgotten, of that protective devotion of his boyhood. He still remembered the expression on Sylvia's face when he passed her by chance in Oxford Street, soon after he came back from his four years of exile in the East and Rome--that look, eager, yet reproachful, then stoically ironic, as if saying: 'Oh, no! after forgetting me four years and more--you can't remember me now!'

Since there were no design information available, Chinese had to reverse-engineer the Soviet steam-powered Type 53 torpedo by taking apart two Soviet samples sold to China. Compounding the problem, the No. 50 Factory of the 705th Institute was only a small factory of 200 employees, and lacked both the necessary equipment and experts needed for the job. The 7th Academy made a top priority in 1963 to order machine tools for the torpedo factory, while with the approvals of both the National Science and Technology Committee and the National Defense Science and Technology Committee, over two dozen experts including the best machine tool operators were assigned to the torpedo factory from other areas including Nanjing.The propulsion system was the critical factor affecting the speed and the range of the torpedo. The Soviet Type 53 steam-powered torpedo was powered by a reciprocating engine and the cylinder of the engine had to sustain tremendous pressure. The only way to build cylinders that meet the requirement was to use a brand-new method to cast a newly developed copper alloy, which took the joint effort of a total of 40 enterprises with more than several dozen attempts until they were successful.

40|$|The Josephson effect {{represents}} {{perhaps the}} prototype of macroscopic phase coherence and is at {{the basis of the}} most widespread interferometer, i. e., the superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Yet, in analogy to electric interference, Maki and Griffin predicted in 1965 that thermal current flowing through a temperature-biased Josephson tunnel junction is a stationary periodic function of the quantum phase difference between the superconductors. The interplay between quasiparticles and Cooper pairs condensate is at the origin of such phase-dependent heat current, and is unique to Josephson junctions. In this scenario, a temperature-biased SQUID would allow heat currents to interfere thus implementing the thermal version of the electric Josephson interferometer. The dissipative character of heat flux makes this coherent phenomenon not less extraordinary than its electric (non-dissipative) counterpart. Albeit weird, this striking effect has never been demonstrated so far. Here we report the first experimental realization of a heat interferometer. We investigate heat exchange between two normal metal electrodes kept at different temperatures and tunnel-coupled to each other through a thermal `modulator' {{in the form of a}} DC-SQUID. Heat transport in the system is found to be phase dependent, in agreement with the original prediction. With our design the Josephson heat interferometer yields magnetic-flux-dependent temperature oscillations of amplitude up to ~ 21 mK, and provides a flux-to-temperature transfer coefficient exceeding ~ 60 mK/Phi_ 0 at 235 mK [Phi_ 0 2 * 10 ^(- 15) Wb is the flux quantum]. Besides offering remarkable insight into thermal transport in Josephson junctions, our results represent a significant step toward phase-coherent <b>mastering</b> of <b>heat</b> in solid-state nanocircuits, and pave the way to the design of novel-concept coherent caloritronic devices.

In the current study, we evaluated the efficacy of a pyrrole derivative bis(2 -ethylhexyl) 1 H-pyrrole- 3, 4 -dicarboxylate], TCCP, purified from leaves of Tinospora cordifolia for its ability to suppress heat shock response and angiogenesis using MDA-MB- 231 cells and the murine mammary carcinoma: Ehrlich ascites tumor model. HSP 90 was downregulated by TCCP by inactivation of HSF- 1 resulting in inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, VEGF-induced cell migration, and concomitant decrease in tumor burden and neo-angiogenesis in vivo. The mechanism of suppression of HSPs involves inactivation of PI 3 K/Akt and phosphorylation on serine 307 of HSF- 1 by the activation of ERK 1. HSF- 1 and HSP 90 and 70 localization and expression were ascertained by immunolocalization, immunoblotting, and qPCR experiments.

We demonstrate excellent fidelity in replication of fluidic structures using hot embossing lithography in conjunction with a photolithographically prepared Si/SU- 8 master mold. Moreover, we introduce rapid prototyping of high-quality structures using an approach that we call soft thermoplastic lithography (STPL). Thanks to the rheological characteristics of the SEBS copolymer, STPL enables thermoforming on a <b>heated</b> <b>master</b> at temperatures around 1700 C. Using this approach, replication can be completed within {{a very short period of}} time (e. g., less than 3 min) without the need of resorting to pressure- or vacuum-assisted instrumentation. Serving as a proof-of-concept, we devise a 3 ̆bcFN that is suitable for the formation of miniaturized arrays comprising fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides and proteins on hard plastic substrates. Resultant spots are characterized by high fluorescent contrast, excellent edge definition, and uniform distribution of probes within the modified areas. 9 Springer-Verlag 2011.

40|$|Heat shock factor 1 (HSF 1) is the <b>master</b> switch for <b>heat</b> shock protein (HSP) {{expression}} in eukaryotes. A synthetic chemical library was screened to identify inhibitors of HSF 1 using a luciferase reporter {{under the control}} of a heat shock element. A compound named KRIBB 11 (N 2 -(1 H-indazole- 5 -yl) -N 6 -methyl- 3 -nitropyridine- 2, 6 -diamine) was identified for its activity in abolishing the heat shock-induced luciferase activity with an IC 50 of 1. 2 μmol/liter. When the cells were exposed to heat shock in the presence of KRIBB 11, the induction of HSF 1 downstream target proteins such as HSP 27 and HSP 70 was blocked. In addition, treatment of HCT- 116 cells with KRIBB 11 induced growth arrest and apoptosis. Markers of apoptosis, such as cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, were detected after KRIBB 11 treatment. Biotinyl-KRIBB 11 was synthesized as an affinity probe for the identification of KRIBB 11 target proteins. Using affinity chromatography and competition assays, KRIBB 11 was shown to associate with HSF 1 in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that KRIBB 11 inhibited HSF 1 -dependent recruitment of p-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor b) to the hsp 70 promoter. Finally, intraperitoneal treatment of nude mice with KRIBB 11 at 50 mg/kg resulted in a 47. 4 % (p < 0. 05) inhibition of tumor growth without body weight loss. Immunoblotting assays showed that the expression of HSP 70 was lower in KRIBB 11 -treated tumor tissue than in control tissues. Because HSPs are expressed at high levels {{in a wide range of}} tumors, these results strengthen the rationale for targeting HSF 1 in cancer therapy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The LNG {{production}} plant processing natural {{gas from the}} Snøhvit field outside Hammerfest in northern Norway utilizes heat and power produced locally with gas turbines. Building a new production train supplied with electricity from the power grid is being evaluated as a possible solution for reducing CO 2 emissions from the plant. Buying electricity from the grid rather than producing it in a {{combined heat and power}} plant makes it necessary {{to find new ways to}} cover the heat loads at the {{production plant}}. A project thesis was written in the fall semester 2010 evaluating the possibility of generating the necessary heat with heat pumps. It was concluded that parts of the required heat could be delivered with reasonable efficiencies using heat pumps. Further, a heat pump delivering heat to the CO 2 -removal system was analyzed. Simulations showed that the required heat load, reaching approximately 62 MW at full production, could be delivered from a heat pump using butane as working fluid. The electrical power consumption for the compressors would be 23. 3 MW, giving the heat pump a COP of 2. 66. In this <b>master</b> thesis the <b>heat</b> pump suggested earlier is analyzed, focusing on identifying losses. Several possible changes that will enhance the heat pump’s efficiency are suggested. The use of other workings fluids and mixed refrigerants are analyzed as well, using the process simulation software Pro/II. The simulations indicates that the heat pump should be equipped with a flash tank at middle pressure, thereby reducing throttling losses and required mass flows through the evaporators. In addition, the suction gas should be overheated as much as possible. Using mixed refrigerants lowers the efficiency of the heat pump. Finally, two new systems are suggested: One with butane as workings fluid and one with pentane, both with flash tank at middle pressure and superheated suction gas. The pentane-system gives the highest system COP, but requires much bigger compressors than the butane-system. The table shows the most important results. Working fluid Electrical power consumption [MW] Volume flow suction gas [m 3 /h] COP Butane (C 4 H 10) 18. 6 55000 3. 35 Pentane (C 5 H 12) 17. 5 150000 3. 54 The power grid electricity is assumed to have been produced without any CO 2 emissions. Covering the heat required by the CO 2 removal system with a gas fired furnace would generate CO 2 emissions of approximately 120, 000 tons per year. Heat pumps are a good solution because they deliver relatively cheap heat without these CO 2 emissions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Heat stress {{transcription}} factors (Hsfs) play {{essential role}} in heat stress response and thermotolerance by controlling the transcriptional activation of heat stress response (HSR) genes including molecular chaperones. Plant Hsf families show a striking multiplicity, with more than 20 members in the many plant species. Among Hsfs, HsfA 1 s act as the <b>master</b> regulators of <b>heat</b> stress (HS) response and HsfA 2 becomes {{one of the most}} abundant Hsfs during HS. Using transgenic plans with suppressed expression of HsfA 2 we have shown that this Hsf is involved in acquired thermotolerance of S. lycopersicum cv Moneymaker as HsfA 2 is required for high expression and maintenance of increased levels of Hsps during repeated cycles of HS treatment. Interestingly, HsfA 2 undergoes temperature-dependent alternative splicing (AS) which results in the generation of seven transcript variants. Three of these transcripts (HsfA 2 -Iα-γ), generated due to alternative splicing of a second, newly identified intron encode for the full length protein involved in acquired thermotolerance. Another 3 transcripts (HsfA 2 -IIIα-γ) are generated due to alternative splicing in intron 1, leading in all cases to a premature termination codon and targeting of these transcripts for degradation via the non-sense mRNA decay mechanism (NMD). Interestingly, excision of intron 2, results into the generation of a second previously unreported protein isoform, annotated as HsfA 2 -II. HsfA 2 -II shows similar transcriptional activity to the full-length protein HsfA 2 -I in the presence of HsfA 1 a but lacks the nuclear export signal (NES) required for nucleocytoplasmic shuttling which allows efficient nuclear retention and stimulation of transcription of HS-induced genes. Furthermore, stability assays showed that HsfA 2 -II exhibits lower protein stability compared to HsfA 2 -I. The presence of a second intron and the generation of a second protein isoform we identified in other Solanaceae species as well. Remarkably, we observed major differences in the splicing efficiency of HsfA 2 intron 2 among different tomato species. Several wild tomato accessions exhibit higher splicing efficiency that favors the generation of HsfA 2 -II, while in these species the splice variant HsfA 2 -Iγ is absent. This natural variation in splicing efficiency specifically occurring at temperatures around 37. 5 oC is associated with the presence of 3 intronic polymorphisms. In the case of wild species these polymorphisms seemingly restrict the binding of RS 2 Z 36, identified as a putative splicing silencer for HsfA 2 intron 2. Tomato accessions with the polymorphic “wild” HsfA 2 show enhanced thermotolerance against a direct severe heat stress incident due to the stronger increase of Hsps and other stress induced genes. Introgression of the “wild” S. pennellii HsfA 2 locus into the cultivar M 82, resulted in enhanced seedling thermotolerance highlighting the potential use of the polymorphic HsfA 2 for breeding. We conclude that alterations in the splicing efficiency of HsfA 2 have contributed to the adaption of tomato species to different environments and these differences might be directly related to natural variation in their thermotolerance. ...|$|R
