5|$|<b>Massage</b> therapy {{does not}} appear to provide much benefit for acute low back pain. A 2015 Cochrane review found that for acute low back pain <b>massage</b> therapy was better than no {{treatment}} for pain only in the short-term. There was no effect for improving function. For chronic low back pain <b>massage</b> therapy was no better than no treatment for both pain and function, though only in the short-term. The overall quality of the evidence was low and the authors conclude that <b>massage</b> therapy is generally not an effective treatment for low back pain.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFoot care is {{attracting}} attention as a medically effective {{treatment of the}} foot lesions caused by diabetes or aging. In this study, we experimentally examined how aromatherapy affects {{the functions of the}} human brain during foot care by using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Four female subjects received foot care <b>massages</b> and aroma oil <b>massages.</b> We analyzed the changes in their oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentrations based on their brain activity by t-tests, and the t-test results showed significant differences between the foot and aroma oil <b>massages.</b> Our questionnaire results obtained from our subjects showed that they felt more comfortable and relaxed while receiving foot care with aroma oils.

40|$|In meat brining-massaging salt homogenization, protein {{extraction}} {{and texture}} of cooked products partly depend on meat tissue structural modifications. Our aim was to quantify these damages by automated image analysis of many sirius red stained histological images from pork Semimembranosus muscles submitted to various <b>massaging</b> conditions (number and rate of deformations). Muscles were <b>massaged</b> in brine (5 or 13 %) using a new laboratory tumbling simulator that enable to control and characterize the mechanical treatment. In samples taken from <b>massaged</b> muscles, zones where fibres could not be automatically separated as in the reference samples were considered as damaged {{and the percentage of}} damaged area (Pda) in the images was calculated. The Pda was equal to about 40 % {{in the middle of the}} muscle at the end of a mechanical treatment that was equivalent to usual <b>massaging</b> conditions in an large industrial tumbler. The cumulated deformation energy (Et) which was assessed from measured force versus strain curves during <b>massaging</b> was varied from 35 to 1500 J.

5|$|Due to {{the poor}} quality of most studies of {{complementary}} and alternative medicine {{in the treatment of}} cancer pain, {{it is not possible to}} recommend integration of these therapies into the management of cancer pain. There is weak evidence for a modest benefit from hypnosis; studies of <b>massage</b> therapy produced mixed results and none found pain relief after 4 weeks; Reiki, and touch therapy results were inconclusive; acupuncture, the most studied such treatment, has demonstrated no benefit as an adjunct analgesic in cancer pain; the evidence for music therapy is equivocal; and some herbal interventions such as PC-SPES, mistletoe, and saw palmetto are known to be toxic to some people with cancer. The most promising evidence, though still weak, is for mind-body interventions such as biofeedback and relaxation techniques.|$|E

5|$|Myrmecophilous (ant-loving) {{caterpillars}} of {{the butterfly}} family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding {{areas in the}} daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants <b>massage</b> them. Some caterpillars produce vibrations and sounds that are perceived by the ants. A similar adaptation {{can be seen in}} Grizzled skipper butterflies that emit vibrations by expanding their wings in order to communicate with ants, which are natural predators of these butterflies. Other caterpillars have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes the ants act as if the caterpillar is one of their own larvae. The caterpillar is then taken into the ant nest where it feeds on the ant larvae.|$|E
