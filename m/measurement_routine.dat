Methods: Thirty cats with FIV, 26 hyperthyroid cats and 28 healthy cats were included. sCysC and uCysC:creatinine (uCysC/uCr) ratio were measured with a human particle-enhanced nephelometric immunoassay, previously validated for feline CysC <b>measurement.</b> <b>Routine</b> renal variables (serum creatinine [sCr], urine specific gravity, urinary protein:creatinine ratio [UPC]) were also measured in the three groups. Results: Cats with hyperthyroidism had significantly higher sCysC and higher uCysC/uCr ratio, lower sCr and a higher UPC than healthy cats. Cats with FIV infection did not show a significantly higher sCysC concentration but had a significantly higher sCr and UPC than healthy cats. uCysC could be detected in only four of them. Conclusions and relevance: This study demonstrated that sCysC is increased in cats with hyperthyroidism, in contrast with sCr, but not in cats with FIV. Many hyperthyroid cats, but only four cats with FIV, had an elevated uCysC/uCr ratio. Further studies may reveal if uCysC might be a valuable marker for tubular dysfunction in cats...|$|E
40|$|Asymmetrically {{sandwiched}} ferromagnetic {{thin films}} display {{a large number}} of spin-orbit effects, including the Dzyaloschinsii-Moriya interaction (DMI), spin-orbit torques (SOT) and magnetoresistance (MR) effects. Their concurrence promises the implementation of interesting magnetic structures like skyrmions in future memory and logic devices. The complex interplay of various effects originating from the spin-orbit coupling and their dependencies on the microstructural details of the material system mandates a holistic characterization of its properties. In this PhD thesis, a comprehensive study of the spin-orbit effects in a chromium oxide/cobalt/platinum trilayer sample series is presented. The determination of the complete micromagnetic parameter set is based on a developed <b>measurement</b> <b>routine</b> that utilizes quasistatic methods. The unambiguous quantification of all relevant constants is crucial for the modeling of the details of magnetic structures in the system. In this context the necessity of a strict distinction of magnetic objects, that are stabilized by magnetostatics or the DMI, was revealed. Furthermore, a sample layout was developed to allow for the simultaneous quantification of the magnitudes of SOTs and MR effects from nonlinear magnetotransport measurements. In conjunction with a structural characterization, the dominating dependence of the effect magnitudes on microstructural details of the systems is concluded. Precisely characterized systems establish a solid groundwork for further investigations that are needed for viable skyrmion-based devices...|$|E

METHODOLOGY: The study was performed on eighty obese patients. They were divided into three groups according to their body mass index. Subjects received acupuncture for three- six months in combination with a low-calorie diet. They were assessed pre and post acupuncture, by anthropometric <b>measurement,</b> <b>routine</b> laboratory tests and, tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-α), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels in serum. RESULTS: The pre-acupuncture results showed significant difference between the three grades of obesity and the controls regarding TNFα, IL- 6 and hsCRP. We found significant reduction in anthropometric measurement of adiposity after acupuncture. In comparing the pre &post acupuncture results of TNF-α, IL- 6 and hsCRP showed high significant reduction after acupuncture. There are highly significant decrease in kidney function (creatinine and uric acid) and lipid profile (cholesterol and triglycerides) and fasting blood glucose, but there was no significant difference in urea, SGPT, SGOT, HDL and LDL. CONCLUSION: Body acupuncture in combination with diet restriction was found to be effective for weight loss and also reduction of the inflammatory reactions.

40|$|We {{present a}} fringe {{projection}} system to measure glowing hot hybrid components in between production processes. For this a high power green light projector, based on TI DLP technology, {{is used to}} create the highest possible contrast between fringes on the red glowing specimen. It has a resolution of 1140 x 912 pixels with a maximum frame rate of 120 images per second for fast measurement. We use a green bandpass filter (525 nm) on the camera lens to block unwanted incoming radiation from the specimen caused by self-emission. Commercial measurement standards are not calibrated for temperatures other than 20 ° C, so they cannot be used to validate measurement data at the required temperatures of up to 1000 °C since thermal expansion invalidates the geometry specification from the calibration data sheet. In our first development we use a uniformly heated pipe made of stainless steel as a dummy specimen to examine the measured geometry data. A pyrometer measures {{the temperature of the}} pipe so the expansion can be easily calculated using the thermal expansion coefficient.

40|$|Cataract {{still remains}} {{the leading cause}} of {{blindness}} affecting 20 million people worldwide. To restore the patients vision the natural lens is removed and replaced by an intraocular lens (IOL). In modern cataract surgery the posterior capsular bag is maintained to prevent inflammation and to enable stabilization of the implant. Refractive changes following cataract surgery are attributable to lens misalignments occurring due to postoperative shifts and tilts of the artificial lens. Mechanical eye models allow a preoperative investigation of the impact of such misalignments and are crucial {{to improve the quality of}} the patients’ sense of sight. Furthermore, the success of sophisticated IOLs that correct high order aberrations is depending on a critical evaluation of the lens position. A new type of an IOL holder is designed and implemented into a preexisting mechanical eye model. A physiological representation of the capsular bag is realized with an integrated film element to guarantee lens stabilization and centering. The positioning sensitivity of the IOL is evaluated by performing shifts and tilts in reference to the optical axis. The modulation transfer function is used to measure the optical quality at each position. Lens stability tests within the holder itself are performed by determining the modulation transfer function before and after measurement sequence. Mechanical stability and reproducible measurement results are guaranteed with the novel capsular bag model that allows a precise interpretation of postoperative lens misalignments.

In addition, the volume of the lumen and different layers in transitional and non-transitional zones in the right and left sides were also determined. Morphometrical, histological and stereological studies were performed on 16 renal arteries of 8 adult male cats. After perfusion and morphometrical <b>measurement,</b> <b>routine</b> tissue processing was carried out by autotechnicon. The processed tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned serially into 5 µm thickness. The sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and orcein. In the morphometrical measurement, the right renal arteries were longer than the left ones with a mean value of 22. 0 ± 0. 2 and 18. 8 ± 0. 1 mm, respectively. Despite the fact that the right renal artery is commonly longer, the length of transitional zone was 7 mm in both renal arteries of adult male cats. The artery has a structure between muscular and elastic type at its origin with several elastic layers in the tunica media which is gradually changed to a muscular type at the distal section after 7 mm from origin of aorta. Transitional zone has an arrangement of parallel elastic fibers which become rare and fragmented towards the non-transitional zone. The volume of tunica intima, tunica media, tunica adventitia and lumen of the artery decrease from transitional zone towards the non-transitional zone and the volume of these areas in both transitional and non-transitional zones in the right renal artery is more than the left one.

40|$|The {{composition}} of fluid phases in the Earth's mantle are significantly affected by oxygen fugacity, and mantle fluids can be reasonably modelled by the C-H- 0 system. Using a broad generalization, under oxidized conditions (at -FMQ) the fluid phase {{is dominated by}} C 02 -H 20 -rich fluids, under relatively reducing conditions (at -FMQ- 2 - 3 log units) by Cf 4 -H 20 -rich fluids, and under strongly reducing conditions (below IW) by CH 4 and H 2. Thus by controlling fluid speciation in the Earth's mantle, oxygen fugacity influences the P-T position of a mantle solidus and the {{composition of}} mantle-derived melts. Oxygen fugacity also constrains the oxidation state of elements and the stability of minerals. For example, natural. diamonds and natural fluids approaching H 20 are at equilibrium in the mantle under reduced conditions at -IW+l- 2 log units. The Fe 3 +f 2. Fe ratios of mantle-derived oxide minerals, such as Cr-rich spinel and Mg-rich ilmenite, in equilibrium with silicates {{can be used to}} indicate the oxygen fugacity (f 02) under which mantle derived mineral assemblages formed. The spinel-based oxygen geobarometer has received a significant amount of attention and appears to be experimentally well constrained for all but the most Cr-rich spinel assemblages. The ilmenite-based oxygen geobarometer, however, was fomiulated on the basis of existing thermodynamic data and has not been experimentally tested. An important prerequisite that needs to be demonstrated when applying oxide mineralbased geothermometers and oxygen geobarometers to natural samples with confidence is mineral stoichiometry of the oxides and a knowledge of their ferric and ferrous iron contents. The availability of a synthetic multilayer crystal and accurately calibrated oxide and silicate standards make it possible to use the electron microprobe for precise oxygen analyses of spinels. A requirement of the oxygen <b>measurement</b> <b>routine</b> described is the use of repetitive statistical analyses of the oxygen standards and subsequent corrections and recalibration.

40|$|In the DPPN {{work package}} ‘Integral Biomass’ we are {{developing}} a non-invasive method to estimate precisely the water content of plants shoots. We have designed and tested a family of microwave resonators, that we named PhenoCAVe. These cavities operate at different resonance frequencies, from 360 MHz up to 1. 15 GHz at the upper limit of radiofrequency. Such frequencies allow to achieve a good penetration depth of electromagnetic waves into tissues together with high sensitivity and stability of measuring water content of the sample. The measurement principle of the PhenoCAVe consists of moving the plant through the resonator and acquiring a ‘layer-by-layer’ response curve with a spatial resolution down to 1 cm. We found and proved that the area under the response {{is directly related to}} the water content of plant shoots. After calibration experiments comparing the signal with destructive methods for maize and rapeseed shoots we obtained a linear dependences with R 2 of 0. 996 and 0. 989, respectively, of the area under the response signal (integral) with the water content of shoots. We found that: a) the method is sensitive to detect < 1 % changes in water content); b) the signal responses to experimental manipulation are rapid (ms); c) the method is stable within the range of environmental conditions (T and RH) typically encountered during the measurements and d), in addition to shoot water content, we can estimate simultaneously in the same scan the soil moisture content of the pots. All this indicates that the approach is suitable to various kinds of applications ranging from real-time quantification of biomass growth starting from germination at different temperature/humidity conditions and rapid reaction of a plant to varying either above- or below-ground environmental conditions to localized treatments to specific regions of leaves. We built a fully automated setup integrated in the <b>measurement</b> <b>routine</b> of the SCREEN-House shoot imaging phenotyping system at IBG 2.

We aim at validating our approaches specifically for screening responses of selected dicot species to low water availability. Experiments conducted with maize show that it is possible to distinguish treatments groups with high confidence starting from early growth stages.

Heat transfer characteristics are described for pool boiling of deionized water and perfluorinated dielectric liquid HFE- 7300 from novel porous copper evaporator surfaces with and without carbon nanotubes. A hybrid surface composed of sintered copper particles and interstitial carbon nanotube arrays exhibited pool boiling heat transfer coefficients for HFE- 7300 improved by 23 % and increased critical heat flux by more than 40 % relative to a plain flat copper surface. ^ Heat transfer measurements and quantitative measurements of bubble ebullition characteristics are obtained for pool boiling of Fluorinert FC- 77 from a smooth and a rough aluminum surface and for pool boiling of Fluorinert FC- 72 from ITO coated glass surfaces with widely varying roughness. Extant correlations for bubble departure diameter and ebullition frequency are compared to the experimental data for FC- 77. Bubble diameter at departure was shown to increase with increasing wall superheat, but the surface roughness was also shown to have an influence. Bubble departure frequency, which in general also increased with heat flux, was not well predicted {{by any of the}} correlations considered from the literature. Nucleation site density and bubble terminal rise velocity were well predicted by correlations. ^ New image processing techniques are developed and demonstrated for an automated bubble <b>measurement</b> <b>routine</b> applied to high-speed video images of boiling of FC- 72 from narrow ITO heaters. A new model is proposed for the relevant characteristic length scale of interaction between bubbles and the boiling surface.

Boiling heat transfer coefficients were found to decrease linearly with surface roughness as defined according to the proposed length scale model. Average bubble departure diameters were found to decrease with heat flux and with surface roughness. Average bubble ebullition and growth periods were found to decrease with heat flux and to increase with bubble departure diameter. Bubble growth was found to vary as the one-third power of time, while the maximum value of void fraction above the boiling surface was found to vary as the two-thirds power of heat flux. ...|$|E

Linear <b>measurement,</b> <b>routine</b> histology and computed tomography of the skull were performed {{at the time of their}} death to evaluate the cranial asymmetries by mesurements of the anatomical landmarks of the craniofacial skeleton of the rats on the two groups and compared then. RESULTS: We did not observe statistically significant differences in any of the compared measurements (p> 0. 05) obtained through the morphologic and radiologic methods. Histologic examinations did not reveal any sign of premature fusion or suture imbrications. Critical decrease in longitudinal body size was noticed as the limbs too in all the animals of group A. CONCLUSION: Constriction of uterine cervix leads to fetus suffering, even death for a few animals, associated to small body size, but not to craniosynostosis. OBJETIVO: Verificar se a cerclagem intra-uterina pode induzir, ao nascimento de ratos Wistar, craniossinostose ou qualquer outra deformidade craniana. MÉTODOS: Uma rata Wistar prenhe foi submetida à laparotomia no 18 º dia de gestação e o cérvix uterino foi suturado com 3 - 0 nylon, impedindo o parto normal que normalmente ocorre no 21 º dia de gestação. A sutura foi liberada 48 horas após o período gestacional normal. A rata gestante deu à luz 11 animais. Seis ratos sobreviveram ao parto (grupo A com restrição). Dois ratos nascidos de outra mãe e com a mesma idade foram utilizados como controle (grupo B sem restrição controle) durante o seu crescimento. Os oito animais foram sacrificados após 1, 2 ano. Medidas lineares, histologia e tomografia computadorizada foram utilizadas para a aferição de assimetrias cranianas através da mensuração de pontos anatômicos do esqueleto craniofacial dos ratos dos dois grupos. RESULTADOS: Não foi observada diferença estatisticamente significante entre as medidas obtidas nos ratos dos dois grupos (p> 0, 05) obtidas através de métodos morfológicos e radiológicos. As análises histológicas não revelaram sinais de fusão prematura da suturas do crânio. Diminuição do segmento corpóreo, bem como do tamanho dos membros foi evidenciado em todos os animais do grupo A. CONCLUSÃO: A restrição do cérvix uterino levou ao sofrimento fetal, morte de alguns animais e diminuição do tamanho do corpo de todos os animais, mas não craniossinostose...|$|E
40|$|We have {{designed}} and tested {{a family of}} microwave resonators (PhenoCAVe) as a non-invasive method to estimate the water content of plants shoots [1]. Operating at the upper limit of radiofrequency, 360 MHz for the greenhouse implemented resonator and 1. 15 GHz for the laboratory setup, allows to achieve a good penetration depth of electromagnetic waves not only into tissues but also in soil. This provides an opportunity to measure water content of both soil and shoot. By moving a plant and the pot through the resonator a ‘layer-by-layer’ response curve is acquired resulting in a blurred 1 D water distribution along the axis of measurement due to the Gaussian distribution of the field inside the resonator. Applying nonlinear fitting, or deconvolution of the obtained response curve, allows to obtain a spatial resolution down to 1 cm. After calibration, the correlations we obtained between the integral of the response signal of the microwave approach and the water content of the shoots destructively measured after harvest were very good for maize (R 2 = 0. 996) and rapeseed (R 2 = 0. 989). Due to our experiments with the setups and theoretical predictions we found that (i) the method is sensitive enough to detect < 1 % changes in water content, (ii) the signal responses to experimental manipulation are rapid (tens of ms); (iii) the method is stable {{within the range of}} environmental conditions (T and RH) typically encountered during the measurements and (iv), in addition to shoot water content, we can estimate simultaneously in the same scan the soil moisture content of the pots. All this indicates that the approach is suitable to various kinds of applications ranging from real-time quantification of biomass growth starting from germination at different temperature/humidity conditions and rapid reaction of a plant to varying aboveground or belowground conditions. We have built a fully automated setup integrated in the <b>measurement</b> <b>routine</b> of the SCREEN-House shoot imaging phenotyping system at IBG 2. The current construction and automation concept allows handling of up to 300 plants with a throughput of about 40 plants per hour which may be further increased in future implementations. The setup allows measuring plants up to 1 m height and about 40 cm width. The laboratory system on the other hand works preferably with one plant over a period of time, allowing continuous measurements of 1 D water distribution, i. e. from germination to a stage of fully formed plant (up to 33 cm in height and 11 cm in width). Both laboratory and greenhouse setups require powerful data analysis software. The main core of it is already operating by using LabView scripts and can be further transformed to provide fully automated data analysis. [1] V. A. Sydoruk, F. Fiorani, S. Jahnke and H. -J.

40|$|Strongly {{correlated}} quantum impurity problems {{appear in}} a wide variety of contexts ranging from nanoscience and surface physics to material science and the theory of strongly correlated lattice models, where they appear as auxiliary systems within dynamical mean-field theory. Accurate and unbiased solutions must usually be obtained numerically, and continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithms, a family of algorithms based on the stochastic sampling of partition function expansions, perform well for such systems. With the present paper we provide an efficient and generic implementation of the hybridization expansion quantum impurity solver, based on the segment representation. We provide a complete implementation featuring most of the recently developed extensions and optimizations. Our implementation allows one to treat retarded interactions and provides generalized <b>measurement</b> <b>routines</b> based on improved estimators for the self-energy and for vertex functions. The solver is embedded in the ALPS-DMFT application package. Comment: accompanied by an open source implementation of the progra...|$|R

40|$|Restrictions {{on the use}} of lead-containing {{materials}} in microelectronical products are confronting the microelectronics industry with the demand for lead-free alternatives for solder interconnects. In this study we investigated the potential of nanoindentation techniques in combination with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) for the local mechanical material characterization of a lead free SnAg 3. 5 Cu 0. 7 solder material in FCIP devices. The derived results show that the data evaluation has to consider the well known pop-in phenomenon whereas no significant dependence on the presence of precipitated Ag particles in the solder was found. In addition, the pronounced creep deformation properties of the solder have {{to be taken into account}} and could be adequately quantified. Furthermore <b>measurement</b> <b>routines</b> for the intermetallic compounds in the interfaces between solder and chip/board metallization were derived. It is shown that multiple reflows do not significantly affect the indentation results compared to soldering kinetics and material composition. The results are discussed in terms of the solder microstructure and compared to results derived from literature...|$|R
