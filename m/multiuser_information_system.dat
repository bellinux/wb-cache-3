40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we present}} efficient, scalable, and {{portable}} parallel algo-rithms for the off-line clustering, the on-line retrieval and the update {{phases of the}} Text Retrieval (TR) problem based on the vector space model and using clustering to organize and handle a dynamic document collection. The algorithms are running on the Coarse-Grained Multicomputer (CGM) and/or the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model which are two models that capture within a few parameters the charac-teristics of the parallel machine. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, our parallel retrieval algorithms are the first ones analyzed under these specific parallel models. For all the phases of the proposed algorithms, we analytically determine the relevant communi-cation and computation cost thereby formally proving the efficiency of the proposed solutions. In addition, we prove that our technique for the on-line retrieval phase per-forms very well in comparison to other possible alternatives in the typical case of a <b>multiuser</b> <b>information</b> retrieval (IR) <b>system</b> where a number of user queries are con-currently submitted to an IR system.

We present a unified theory for eight special cases of channel capacity and rate distortion with state information, which also extends existing results to arbitrary pairs of independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.) correlated state information available at the sender and at the receiver, respectively. In particular, the resulting general formula for channel capacity assumes the same form as the generalized Wyner–Ziv rate distortion function Index Terms—Channel with state <b>information,</b> duality, <b>multiuser</b> <b>information</b> theory, rate distortion with state information, Shannon theory, writing on dirty paper.
