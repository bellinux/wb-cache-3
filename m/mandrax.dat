25|$|The autopsy {{revealed}} that Kelvin had most certainly died from massive blood loss from an anal injury, probably {{caused by the}} insertion of a blunt object, such as a beer bottle, {{and that he had}} suffered bruising and injuries to his head and back, which were likely to have been caused by blows. Analysis of Kelvin's bloodstream revealed traces of four hypnotic drugs, including <b>Mandrax</b> and Noctec. With the drugs as their only firm lead at that stage, police began sifting through prescriptions for those drugs. During their search they found a prescription for <b>Mandrax</b> issued to a B. von Einem, a name familiar to police as he had been questioned previously over the deaths of three young men and the alleged sexual assault of another.|$|E
25|$|Four {{days after}} the body was discovered, Einem was {{questioned}} by the police about the murder of Kelvin. He initially claimed {{that he had no}} knowledge of what had happened to Kelvin and said that on the night of abduction he had been in bed with the flu.

He denied having any other drugs in his possession, but police also seized a bottle of Noctec, concealed on a ledge behind his wardrobe. Einem also allowed police to take hair and blood samples, as well as carpets and other materials for testing.|$|E
500|$|Through late 1967 {{and early}} 1968, Barrett's {{behaviour}} became increasingly erratic and unpredictable, {{partly as a}} consequence of his reported heavy use of psychedelic drugs, most prominently LSD. There is also much speculation that he suffered from schizophrenia. Once described as joyful, friendly, and extroverted, he became increasingly depressed and socially withdrawn, and experienced hallucinations, disorganized speech, memory lapses, intense mood swings, and periods of catatonia. Although the changes began gradually, he went missing for a long weekend and, according to several friends including Rick Wright, came back [...] "a completely different person." [...] One of the striking features of his change was the development of a blank, empty, dead-eyed stare. He was unable to recognize old friends that he had known for years, and often did not know where he was. At one point, while {{on a tour of the}} city of Los Angeles, Barrett is said to have exclaimed, [...] "Gee, it sure is nice to be in Las Vegas!" [...] Many reports described him on stage, strumming one chord through the entire concert, or not playing at all. At a show at The Fillmore in San Francisco, during a performance of [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", Barrett slowly detuned his guitar. The audience seemed to enjoy such antics, unaware of the rest of the band's consternation. Interviewed on Pat Boone's show during this tour, Syd's reply to Boone's questions was a [...] "blank and totally mute stare," [...] according to Nick Mason, [...] "Syd wasn't into moving his lips that day." [...] Barrett exhibited similar behaviour during the band's first appearance on Dick Clark's popular TV show American Bandstand. Although surviving footage of this appearance shows Barrett miming his parts of the song competently, during a group interview afterwards, when asked two questions by Clark, Barrett's answers were terse, almost to the point of rudeness (though, Clark noted, they had been flying non-stop from London to Los Angeles). During this time, Barrett would often forget to bring his guitar to sessions, damage equipment and occasionally was unable to hold his pick. Before a performance in late 1967, Barrett reportedly crushed <b>Mandrax</b> tranquilliser tablets and an entire tube of Brylcreem into his hair, which subsequently melted down his face under the heat of the stage lighting, making him look like [...] "a guttered candle". Nick Mason later disputed the <b>Mandrax</b> portion of this story, stating that [...] "Syd would never waste good mandies".|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, at the DEO, Maggie informs Winn {{about why}} {{he was at the}} museum, as he showed him footage of a {{painting}} that ends up missing while he and Lyra was there, except that Lyra isn't seen on camera. Winn is now a suspect and is taken to jail. After agreeing to give them 24 hours to clear Winn's name, Alex and James help Winn find out more about Lyra. It turns out that Lyra cannot be photographed or videotaped because of her alien status and background, but Winn is devastated to learn that she has done this before she met him. Later on at the bar, Alex bribes a customer with Hamilton tickets and get a break, leading Winn to Lyra's trailer. As Winn confronts Lyra, she claims that he was a pawn, disappointing Winn and he leaves, revealing Guardian and Alex to take Lyra in. But they are met with company, leading up to a battle that Guardian and Alex would fight off, only to have the gang members escape and leave Lyra behind with the painting. Lyra is taken into custody by the DEO, where she comes clean that the gang used her because her brother was in debt and she agreed to help them. With Winn's help, they pinpoint the leader, <b>Mandrax,</b> an ex-Fort Rozz prisoner for art trafficking. Despite J'onn's warning not to trust Lyra, Winn takes the painting and Lyra with him. When they meet with <b>Mandrax,</b> Winn shows him the painting, but he catches on that it's a fake and attempts to kill them, only to have Guardian and Alex thwarting his plans. Winn admits to Lyra that this was a plan he set up with the DEO to capture <b>Mandrax</b> and his gang. With the painting returned to the museum, Winn is cleared as <b>Mandrax</b> is now in custody. He then convinces Lyra (who, along with her brother, are not officially guilty of anything) to stay in National City.|$|E

5000|$|Methaqualone is a sedative-{{hypnotic}} drug {{similar in}} effect to barbiturates, a general CNS depressant. Its use peaked in the 1960s and 1970s as a hypnotic {{for the treatment}} of insomnia, and as a sedative and muscle relaxant. It has also been used illegally as a recreational drug, commonly known as Quaaludes ( [...] ), particularly in the 1970s in North America, or as <b>Mandrax</b> (methaqualone 250 mg combined with diphenhydramine 25 mg).|$|E
5000|$|Methaqualone (Quaaludes) became {{increasingly}} popular as a recreational {{drug in the}} late 1960s and 1970s, known variously as [...] "ludes" [...] or [...] "sopers" [...] (also [...] "soaps") in the U.S. and [...] "mandrakes" [...] and [...] "mandies" [...] in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. The drug was often used by hippies and by people who went dancing at glam rock clubs in the 1970s and at discos (one slang term for Quaaludes in the disco era was [...] "disco biscuits"). In the mid-1970s, there were bars in Manhattan called [...] "juice bars" [...] that only served non-alcoholic drinks that catered to people who liked to dance on methaqualone. Purported methaqualone is in a significant minority of cases found to be inert, or contain diphenhydramine or benzodiazepines.

50|$|The actual concert {{included}} many live favourites from the Pink Fairies history not {{represented on the}} LP (which is in the wrong order anyway). Other songs performed at the concert included Do It, 3/5 Mile in 10 Seconds, The Snake, Street Urchin and Bye Bye Johnny plus a drum solo... poor recording quality led to a sadly abbreviated release. This was in truth the 2nd reunion of the year, the first having taken place in Feb 75 without the presence of Twink and generally considered the better of the two despite the Fairies non-headlining status at the earlier gig. Demand was so high that those locked out attempted to burn down {{the doors of the}} venue. The stage was 'enhanced' by a large polystyrene <b>Mandrax</b> tablet erected by the road crew and the distribution to the crowd of many cannabis 'joints'. Such was the reaction that the trio of Wallis/Sanderson/Hunter went on to tour at length after the second concert, Wallis juggling his commitment to Motorhead.|$|E
5000|$|Heartbreaker is {{the sixth}} and final studio album by English rock group Free, that {{provided}} them with {{one of their most}} successful singles, [...] "Wishing Well".

50|$|When F. W. de Klerk became {{president}} in 1990, he ordered that {{production of the}} chemicals be stopped and the lethal agents destroyed. Basson concentrated on non-lethal chemical agents and chemicals the government had not banned. That included {{a large amount of}} ecstasy and <b>Mandrax</b> that were apparently exported or allegedly sold to drug dealers in communities active in the anti-apartheid movement (cf. Basson brownies). Most of the stockpile disappeared afterwards. Scientists working on the project later stated that they believed it was to be used to create drug-laced tear gas. In January 1992, FRELIMO troops conducted an operation near the South African border. During the course of the operation, they were allegedly exposed to what was thought to have been a chemical agent. Some of the soldiers died during the incident and others required hospitalisation. Investigation by the United Nations, United States and the United Kingdom identified it as BZ nerve agent. US and Britain began to pressure the South African government and in January 1993 Project Coast was wound down. Basson was officially retired and hired to dismantle the project, and allegedly profited when some of the South African front companies were privatised. Later government investigation found that there were large amounts of chemicals and agents missing.|$|E
40|$|Cannabis and <b>Mandrax</b> {{abuse is}} unique to South Africa; and most {{research}} has focused on the socio-economic impact rather than the adverse effects on the developing brain. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} determine the effects of <b>Mandrax</b> and Cannabis alone and in combination on the developing brain by using primary and suspension cultures of the chick embryo brain. Exposure of primary chick embryo neuronal (CEN) cultures to the carrier ethanol, <b>Mandrax</b> and Cannabis, for 24 h resulted in a significant dose dependent decrease in cell number for <b>Mandrax</b> alone. Increasing concentrations of Cannabis in combination with <b>Mandrax</b> inhibited the toxic effect of <b>Mandrax.</b> In CEN suspensions, <b>Mandrax</b> alone induced a significant time–concentration dependent decrease in esterase activity following 1 and 4 h exposure. In combination with Cannabis, a significant increase in esterase activity was observed after 4 h exposure. In conclusion <b>Mandrax</b> is toxic to CEN cells in vitro while Cannabis seemed to have a protective effect; however, this study does not investigate the abuse of these drugs in the form commonly abused, namely inhaled smoke...|$|E
