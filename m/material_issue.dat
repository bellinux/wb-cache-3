2500|$|Phair's {{entry into}} the music {{industry}} began when she met guitarist Chris Brokaw, {{a member of the}} band Come. Brokaw was dating one of Phair's friends, and stayed at their loft in Soma one weekend. [...] After an unsuccessful attempt to get musical traction in San Francisco, Phair returned to Chicago, where she began writing songs and recording homemade tapes under the name Girly Sound. She became part of the alternative music scene in Chicago and became friends with <b>Material</b> <b>Issue</b> and Urge Overkill, two of Chicago's upstart bands to go national in the early 1990s, as well as Brad Wood and John Henderson, head of Feel Good All Over, an independent label in Chicago.

This statement, premature as it is, does him honour, for I don't suppose for a moment that the thought of the <b>material</b> <b>issue</b> involved in the verdict of the Court of Inquiry influenced him in the least. I don't suppose that he is more impressed by the writ of two million dollars nailed (or more likely pasted) to the foremast of the Norwegian than I am, who don't believe that the Storstad is worth two million shillings. This is merely a move of commercial law, and even the whole majesty of the British Empire (so finely invoked by the Sheriff) cannot squeeze more than a very moderate quantity of blood out of a stone. Sir Thomas, in his confident pronouncement, stands loyally by a loyal and distinguished servant of his company.|$|E
