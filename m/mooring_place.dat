Its total length is estimated at 6–7km (3.7–4.3mi), [...] or [...] depending on the number of supposed bends taken into account. A total of [...] has been archaeologically traced, mainly at its western end close to the Bay of Corinth. There the known trackway began at a <b>mooring</b> <b>place</b> south of the more recent canal and ran parallel to the waterway for a few hundred meters, after which it switched to the north side, running in a slight bend a similar distance along the canal. From there on, the Diolkos either followed in a straight line the course of the modern canal, or swung south in a wide arc. The roadway ended at the Saronic Gulf at the village Schoinos, modern-day Kalamaki, described by Strabo as the trackway's eastern terminal. Sections of the Diolkos have been destroyed by the 19th-century Corinth Canal and other modern installations.|$|E

2500|$|The East Harbor, which {{provided}} the most protected <b>mooring</b> <b>place</b> in Provincetown, had a [...] inlet from Provincetown Harbor, and effectively blocked off access to Provincetown by land. Until the late 19th century, no road led to Provincetown – the only land route connecting {{the village to}} points back toward the mainland was along a thin stretch of beach along the shore to the north (known locally as the [...] "backshore"). [...] A wooden bridge was erected over the East Harbor in 1854, only to be destroyed by a winter storm and ice two years later. [...] Although the bridge was replaced the following year, any traveler who crossed it still needed to traverse several miles over sand routes, which, together with the backshore route, was occasionally washed out by storms. [...] This made Provincetown very much like an island. Its residents relied almost entirely upon its harbor for its communication, travel, and commerce needs.|$|E

50|$|Beverley Beck {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 1296, when the Archbishop of York sought to have fish-weirs {{removed from the}} River Hull, so that boats could reach Beverley. Grovehill, formerly known as Grevale and located near the junction with the River Hull, {{was used as a}} <b>mooring</b> <b>place</b> for barges. The agreement that the Archbishop had made with the fish-weir owners was then transferred to the burgesses of the Beverley Corporation, and by 1344 the Beck was navigable as far as Beverley. The first known accounts, for scouring and cleansing of the Beck date to this year. The Corporation assumed that they had a monopoly on the waterway, and leased it to tenants, who then had to provide two boats in which all cargo was carried. This changed to a system of tolls from 1704, which allowed other boats to use the Beck. The wharf at Grovehill was later converted into a lock.|$|E
