A method has been developed for the manufacture of polymeric multimode waveguides using an electrostatic field-induced self assembly and pattern formation process. A spin-coated liquid optical polymer placed between two conductive plates experiences an electrostatic force from an applied electric field gradient across the plates. Surface electrohydrodynamics instability patterning is employed to fabricate optical core microstructures using a patterned <b>master</b> <b>plate.</b> The result shows a good replication of the pattern from the <b>master</b> <b>plate</b> to the optical polymer. The process protocols were defined to achieve waveguides with low sidewall roughness together with an optical coupling interface. We have demonstrated multimode waveguide arrays with a 50 μm × 50 μm cross section and 250 -μm pitch on a 10 mm × 10 mm flexible substrate. The refractive index and absorption measurement of the electrostatic-induced optical film show insignificant changes when compared with the unexposed film. Using the cutback approach, the propagation loss of the waveguide is measured at - 1. 97 dB/cm. The whole fabrication process is found to be fast, cost-effective, and no photosensitive material is needed as in the conventional photolithography approach...|$|E

40|$|Approximately 41, 000 <b>master</b> <b>plates</b> (Fig. 1) are {{required}} for the Extended Barrel Hadronic Calorimeter for the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Early in the R&D program associated with the detector, it was recognized that the fabrication of these steel laminations was a significant issue, {{both in terms of}} the cost to produce these high precision formed plates, as well as the length of time required to produce all plates for the calorimeter. Two approaches were given serious consideration: laser cutting and die stamping. The Argonne group was a strong supporter of the latter approach and in late 1995 initiated an R&D program to demonstrate the feasibility and cost effectiveness of die stamping these plates by constructing a die and stamping approximately 2000 plates for use in construction of three full size prototype modules. This was extremely successful and die stamping was selected by the group for production of these plates. When the prototype die was constructed it was matched to the calorimeter envelope at that time. This subsequently changed. However with some minor adjustments in the design envelope and a small compromise in terms of instrumented volume, it became possible to use this same die for the production of all <b>master</b> <b>plates</b> for the Tile Calorimeter. Following an extensive series of discussions and an evaluation of the performance of the stamping presses available to our collaborators in Europe, it was decided to ship the US die to CERN for use in stamping <b>master</b> <b>plates</b> for the barrel section of the calorimeter. This was done under the supervision of CERN and JINR, Dubna, and carried out at the TATRA truck plant at Koprivinice, Czech Republic. It was a great success. Approximately 41, 000 plates were stamped and fully met specification. Moreover, the production time was significantly reduced by avoiding the need of constructing and then qualifying a second die for use in Europe. This also precluded small geometrical differences between the barrel and extended barrel plates (and therefore submodules) being an issue, with the result that standard submodules are fully exchangeable between the two types of module...|$|R

40|$|We {{have devised}} a novel plate assay method for {{detecting}} mutants of Vibrio cholerae altered {{in the production}} of cholera toxin (tox mutants). Colonies replicated from a <b>master</b> <b>plate</b> are grown on the surface of a cellulose filter disc to which ganglioside-albumin conjugates have been attached. Toxin secreted by the colonies is tightly bound to the ganglioside filters. After removal of the cells by washing, the bound toxin may be detected by treating the filters with radioactively labeled antibodies against either whole toxin or one of its constituent polypeptide chains, followed by autoradiography. Colonies producing significantly greater of lesser amounts of toxin than the parental type are easily recognized and can be shown in liquid culture to have the corresponding hypertoxinogenic or hypotoxinogenic phenotype. This method, termed "the ganglioside filter assay," is applicable to screening large numbers of colonies and should facilitate isolation of various specific classes of mutants in cholera toxin production.

Germination percent of macrocysts has been greatly increased {{by the presence of}} a growing fungus during the resting stage.

(2) Amebae emerging from a single macrocyst are identical about 90 % of the time. (3) Any single combination of parental markers may emerge from a given macrocyst, and all combinations appear in approximately equal frequencies. These findings suggest that normally one of four nuclei produced by meiosis survives in every macrocyst and that all markers examined are unlinked. (4) About 10 % of the macrocysts germinate to give two or more classes of progeny. These may result from the presence of a second zygote in the macrocyst or from the survival of two nuclei after meiosis.

40|$|Because of the multiple-step {{process that}} is {{involved}} in the detection of mutagenized restriction enzyme sites in plasmid DNA, a simple and accurate method was developed to analyse the plasmid DNA of site-directed mutagenesis experiments from bacterial colonies. The desired mutated part is located between the Eco RI restriction site on pUC 19. Two mutagenic primers were designed to replace only one nucleotide on segments A and B of the bi-segmented genome of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Two restriction sites were created for those mutations in each segment, Fsp I and Dra I, respectively. Following a protocol from the site-directed mutagenesis kit, the mutated plasmids were used to transform, and were propagated and maintained in DH 5 alpha competent cells. Colonies were picked from the <b>master</b> <b>plate,</b> and used as DNA template for PCR. The PCR technique included the design of two pairs of primers, one for each segment, which were to amplify a region up to 1000 bp. Samples were pre-incubated for 3 min at 94 degrees C to induce bacterial lysis before starting the nucleic acid amplification. The PCR products 918 bp from segment A and 650 bp from segment B were digested with Fsp I and Dra I at 37 degrees C for 1 h.

40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} which permits the rapid screening of E. coli colonies for mutants with defective enzymes of phospholipid metabolism. In this procedure, a disc of filter paper is pressed down on an agar plate containing several hundred colonies of mutagen-treated cells, after which the paper is lifted off. In the process the colonies are transferred to the paper, giving rise to a replica print of the <b>master</b> <b>plate.</b> The few cells from each colony left on the master keep growing in the original pattern. The pattern of colonies is also retained on the filter paper, even after the cells are rendered permeable with lysozyme and EDTA. Colonies treated in this manner remain absorbed to the paper, where they can convert sn-(U- 14 -C) glycero- 3 -P to phosphatidyl(U- 14 -C) glycerophosphate, dependent on added CDP-diglyceride. Unrelated reactions of sn-(U- 14 -C) glycero- 3 -P that may obscure the synthesis of phosphatidyl-glycerophosphate are inhibited {{by the addition of}} reagents poisoning energy generation. The radioactive phospholipid that forms around each colony on the paper is precipitated in situ with trichloroacetic acid, and unreacted sn-(U- 14 -C) glycero- 3 -P is washed away. After autoradiography, the colonies on the filter paper are stained with Coomassie blue. When the autoradiogram is superimposed on the strained paper, mutants are identified as blue colonies lacking a black halo. With this method, 20, 000 colonies were screened in several days. Four mutants were identified with low levels of CDP-diglyceride:snglycero- 3 -P phosphatidyl transferase (EC 2. 7. 8. 5, GLYCEROL-PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATIDYLTRANSFERASE, PHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE) IN EXTRACTS. With a similar assay, 10, 000 additional colonies were screened for mutants with altered CDP-diglyceride:L-serine O-phosphatidyltransferase (EC 2. 7. 8. 8, phosphatidylserine synthetase), and four strains were found in which the enzyme is thermolabile.
