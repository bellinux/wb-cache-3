50|$|The law {{holds for}} the A and E {{proposition}}s of the Aristotelian square of opposition. For example, the A proposition 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' and the E proposition 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' cannot both be true {{at the same}} time, since {{no one can be}} honest and not honest at the same time. But both can be false, if some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> honest, and some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not. For if some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> honest, the proposition 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' is false. And if some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not honest, the proposition 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' is false also.|$|R
50|$|A {{universal}} affirmative proposition, such as, 'Every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' and {{a universal}} negative proposition {{having the same}} subject and predicate, such as, 'No <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white,' are called contrary. A universal affirmative proposition ("Every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white") and the non-universal denial of that proposition in a way ("Some <b>man</b> <b>is</b> not white") are called contradictories. Of contradictories, one must be true, the other false. Contraries cannot both be true, although they can both be false, and hence their contradictories are both true (for example, both, 'Every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest,' and 'No <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest,' are false. But their contradictories, 'Some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not honest,' and, 'Some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> honest,' are both true.|$|R

5|$|No Country for Old <b>Men</b> <b>is</b> a 2007 American neo-Western thriller film produced, directed, written, {{and edited}} by Joel and Ethan Coen. Based on Cormac McCarthy's {{novel of the}} same name, the film is about an {{ordinary}} man to whom chance delivers a fortune that is not his, and the ensuing cat-and-mouse drama as the paths of three men intertwine in the desert landscape of 1980 West Texas. The film stars Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, and Javier Bardem, with Woody Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald, Garret Dillahunt, Tess Harper, and Beth Grant in featured roles.|$|E

5|$|Children of <b>Men</b> <b>is</b> a 2006 British-American dystopian thriller film {{directed}} and co-written by Alfonso Cuarón. The screenplay, based on P. D.

The film takes place in 2027, where two decades of human infertility have left society {{on the brink of}} collapse. Illegal immigrants seek sanctuary in the United Kingdom, where the last functioning government imposes oppressive immigration laws on refugees. Owen plays civil servant Theo Faron, who must help a refugee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) escape the chaos. Children of Men also stars Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Charlie Hunnam.|$|E
50|$|Another logical {{opposition}} {{implied by}} this, though not mentioned explicitly by Aristotle, is 'alternation' (alternatio), consisting of 'subalternation' and 'superalternation'. Alternation is a relation between a particular statement and a universal {{statement of the}} same quality such that the particular is implied by the other. The particular is the subaltern of the universal, which is the particular's superaltern. For example, if 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' is true, its contrary 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' is false. Therefore the contradictory 'some <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' is true. Similarly the universal 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' implies the particular 'not every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white'.|$|R

5|$|Hopton {{arrived on}} 27 November, given by King Charles 1,580 horse, but only around 2,000 conscripted {{infantry}} and 500 troops {{recently returned from}} fighting in Munster, Ireland. Hopton had been ordered in late September to make secure Dorset, Wiltshire and Hampshire, and to push {{as far as possible}} toward London. Toward this end, Hopton spread his men across Hampshire County, quartering them for the winter at Winchester, Alresford, Petersfield and Alton. He did so to alleviate the burden on any one town, and because winter was approaching quickly. However, this left his army vulnerable. Hopton placed Crawford in charge of Alton, and on 1 December Crawford began to fortify the small town as quickly as he could. Crawford had at his disposal one cavalry regiment and one infantry regiment, though his exact number of <b>men</b> <b>is</b> unknown; it was likely around 1,000.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Chinese historiography {{celebrated the}} battle of Caishi as an {{important}} victory for China. Caishi {{was held in the}} same esteem as the Battle of Fei River in 383, when the Eastern Jin defeated the northern invaders of the Former Qin. However, its portrayal as a victory against overwhelming odds, in which 18,000 Song soldiers overcame an army of nearly half a million <b>men,</b> <b>is</b> likely an exaggeration. Modern historians believe that the number of Jin soldiers was far lower. The Song possessed multiple advantages, and the battle was more evenly matched than contemporaneous historians suggest. The Song had larger ships and ample time to prepare while the Jin army gathered supplies and ships for the crossing. It was also impossible for the Jin to use cavalry, the most important asset of the Jurchen military, during a naval engagement.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} {{compartments}} that store lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life {{of lead in}} these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone. Lead in the bones, teeth, hair, and nails is bound tightly and not available to other tissues, and is generally thought not to be harmful. In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health effects on children. The estimated half-life of lead in bone is 20 to 30years, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone. The half-life of lead in the blood in <b>men</b> <b>is</b> about 40days, {{but it may be}} longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing remodeling, which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream. Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone. Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs.|$|E
