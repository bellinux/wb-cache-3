40|$|Neisseria meningitidis is the causative {{agent of}} {{epidemic}} <b>meningococcal</b> meningitis and <b>septicaemia.</b> Type IV pili are surface organelles that mediate {{a variety of}} functions, including adhesion, twitching motility, and competence for DNA binding and uptake in transformation. The secretin PilQ is required for type IV pilus expression at the cell surface, and forms a dodecameric cage-like macromolecular complex in the meningococcal outer membrane. PilQ-null mutants are devoid of surface pili, and prevailing {{evidence suggests that the}} PilQ complex facilitates extrusion and retraction of type IV pili across the outer membrane. Defining the orientation of the meningococcal PilQ complex in the membrane is a prerequisite for understanding the structure–function relationships of this important protein in pilus biology. In order to begin to define the topology of the PilQ complex in the outer membrane, polyhistidine insertions in N- and C-terminal regions of PilQ were constructed, and their subcellular locations examined. Notably, the insertion epitopes at residues 205 and 678 were located within the periplasm, whereas residue 656 was exposed at the outer surface of the outer membrane. Using electron microscopy with Ni-NTA gold labelling, it was demonstrated that the insertion at residue 205 within the N-terminus mapped to a site on the arm-like features of the 3 D structure of the PilQ multimer.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There are {{concerns}} that quality {{of medical care}} may be poorer on weekends than weekdays. Invasive <b>meningococcal</b> disease, comprising <b>septicaemia</b> and meningitis, is often life threatening unless it is immediately and effectively treated regardless of day of the week. We test the hypothesis that numbers of deaths from meningococcal disease outside hospital without admission, and case fatality rates (CFRs) following admission, did not differ between weekends and weekdays. METHODS: Analysis of linked hospital and mortality data, England, 1999 - 2010. RESULTS: The study comprised 19 729 people. There {{was no significant difference}} between days of the week in the number of deaths outside hospital in people who never reached hospital care. Of people who were admitted, CFRs for weekend and weekday admissions were the same: 4. 9 % (262 / 5315) on weekends and 4. 9 % (678 / 13 798) on weekdays. We undertook sensitivity analyses and analysed multivariate models but, however the data were analysed, the result of no 'weekend effect' remained. CONCLUSIONS: There are few, if any, other acute diseases in which the difference in mortality outcome between no treatment and effective treatment is so great and unequivocally related to care itself. There was no evidence of excess deaths from meningococcal disease associated with weekend care...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To {{review the}} {{diagnostic}} value {{of using a}} thorough necropsy protocol for the investigation of sudden infant deaths, with particular emphasis {{on the value of}} routine ancillary laboratory investigations. METHODS: The necropsy and related records of all neonatal, infant, and young childhood deaths (under three years) referred for medicolegal investigation at Dundee from 1990 to early 1998 were reviewed retrospectively. Relevant positive and negative findings were abstracted from the police reports, hospital medical records, necropsy reports, and the results of routine bacteriological, virological, toxicological, and biochemical laboratory investigations. RESULTS: Within the study period, 63 deaths presented as apparent "cot deaths," nine as suspected homicides, nine as neonatal deaths, and 14 in some other manner. An adequate cause of death was identified on the basis of necropsy and laboratory investigations in 35 % of the 63 apparent cot deaths, leaving 63 % to be finally categorised as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Ten (16 %) of the apparent cot deaths were explained on the sole basis of unexpected positive microbiological findings, mostly pneumococcal or <b>meningococcal</b> meningitis and/or <b>septicaemia.</b> Petechial haemorrhages were identified at one or more intrathoracic site in 90 % of SIDS and in 55 % of explained cot deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Early and extensive laboratory investigations performed routinely in apparent cot deaths provide an unexpectedly high positive diagnostic yield.

40|$|Neisseria meningitidis is the {{bacterium}} responsible for <b>meningococcal</b> meningitis and <b>septicaemia</b> in humans. <b>Meningococcal</b> disease {{is primarily a}} disease of young children, characterized by rapid deterioration from first symptoms to death, with an 11 % fatality rate and a global distribution. Patterns of genetic diversity in meningococcal populations provide an account of their evolutionary history and structure, which can be inferred by population genetics modelling. Understanding these phenomena can inform control and prevention strategies, and provides interesting case studies in evolution. The aim of this thesis is to develop population genetics techniques for inferring the evolutionary history of meningococci. I begin by reviewing the field, and justifying the use of coalescent methods in modelling microparasite populations. Inference on carriage populations of meningococci under the standard neutral model and the neutral microepidemic model is performed using a modification to approximate Bayesian computation. AMOVA and Mantel tests are used to quantify the differentiation between carriage and disease populations, {{and the extent to}} which geography and host age structure carriage populations. The results are used to propose revised coalescent models for meningococcal evolution. The role of natural selection in shaping meningococcal diversity is investigated using a novel method that utilises an approximation to the coalescent and reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo to detect sites under selection in the presence of recombination. Having performed a simulation study to assess the statistical properties of the method, I apply it to the porB antigen locus and seven housekeeping loci in N. meningitidis. There is strong evidence for selection imposed by the host immune system in the antigen locus, but not the housekeeping loci which are functionally constrained. Finally I discuss the future direction of population genetic approaches to understanding infectious disease. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R

40|$|Meningococcal {{disease is}} a fulminant {{infection}} with an overall mortality of 8 %. Mortality is significantly increased with <b>meningococcal</b> <b>septicaemia,</b> particularly when {{there has been a}} delay in the diagnosis.

40|$|Meningococcal {{disease is}} a rare but {{potential}} killer in both adults and children. Community acquired meningococcal disease {{is caused by a}} variety of serogroups of Neisseria meningitides. Of the five main subgroups, A, B, C, W 135 and Y, serogroups, A and Y are rarely identified in Australia.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Neisseria meningitidis {{serogroup}} B is {{the most}} common cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults. Early recognition and prompt intervention with antibiotics are thought to be key to preventing serious complications. AIM: Explore how general practitioners evaluate and manage febrile children with possible meningitis or <b>meningococcal</b> <b>septicaemia.</b> DESIGN OF THE STUDY: Qualitative study using one-to-one, semi-structured interviews. SETTING: General practices in the Avon Health Authority district. METHOD: Twenty-six general practitioners were purposefully sampled, using a sampling frame to ensure a range of experience and practices in a variety of settings Data management and analysis were conducted using a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Key themes to emerge were the effect that fear of meningitis has upon parents and general practitioners; the difficulties associated with reaching a diagnosis; and the existence of barriers to the use of guidelines and pre-hospital penicillin. When assessing a febrile child, participating general practitioners rarely thought that meningitis or <b>meningococcal</b> <b>septicaemia</b> were likely, but were aware that this was frequently the principal parental concern. They relied upon intuitive rather than systematic methods to distinguish serious from self-limiting conditions, rarely making a definitive diagnosis. Although concerned about 'missed cases', interviewees doubted that current management could be improved. They questioned the assumption that guidelines could be sufficiently discriminating to be helpful and thought it unlikely that they would be followed in everyday clinical practice. Pre-hospital penicillin was only given if the diagnosis of meningitis or septicaemia was thought to be certain. CONCLUSIONS: There is a substantial gap in perception between primary and secondary care in the diagnostic and management approach to children who may have meningitis or <b>meningococcal</b> <b>septicaemia.</b> Until this is addressed, further attempts to improve early intervention in primary care are unlikely to succeed...|$|E
