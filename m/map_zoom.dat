The term zoom is comparable to a zoom-able visual [...] internet map. A country is divided into regions on the first map then the next zoomed map will have a breakdown of the regions and so forth until a city level is reached. These successive maps rely on a dependable texture as the <b>map</b> <b>zoom</b> progresses. This produces a familiarity as one zooms from the proceeding map. This is achieved in many instances with line orientation, area and consistent shape. The Braille text on the map is placed next to a rectangular textured legend for area identification.|$|E

40|$|AbstractForest fire is {{a serious}} problem because it causes damages to forest {{ecosystem}} and surrounding environment in many areas in Sumatera and Kalimantan including Riau Province. One of activities in forest fire prevention is to provide relevant information about hotspot and characteristics of areas where hotspots probably occur. Such information can be presented in a geographic information system (GIS) for classifying hotspot occurrences. This study aims to develop a classification module for hotspot occurrences in a GIS using OpenGeo Suite 3. 0. The classification module was made using the decision tree method namely the C 4. 5 algorithm. Applying the C 4. 5 algorithm on the forest fire data generated 109 classification rules with accuracy of 69. 56 %. The SIG has major features such as displaying map, pan <b>map,</b> <b>zoom,</b> in, zoom out, scale, mouse position and a classification module for hotspot occurrences based on characteristics of areas. The GIS enables users to determine whether an area is potential for hotspot incidence or not based on its characteristics.

40|$|SMC has the {{database}} TOPSWING (Total Population of Sweden Individual and Geographical database). TOPSWING contains socio-econmical information on Swedens population {{during the years}} 1985 - 1995. The kind of information that exists is for example a persons habitation, income, education level, migration, civil status, sex, age and so on. If a person dies, there will be information about cause of death, when the person died etc. With these kinds of data from TOPSWING {{it is possible to}} study geographical connections over regions, years and/or death causes. This undergraduate project consisted of three steps. The first step was to make new tables in {{the database}} to enhance the search process, to make it less time consuming. With the old tables, it could sometimes take several hours to get a result, but with the new tables a result could be reached in a few minutes. The second step was to create a GUI (graphical user interface) that was user-friendly. Instead of writing long SQL-commands it is now possible to get a result just by making a few choices with the mouse. By selecting one or two region(s), a year and a cause of death, the result is displayed as a barchart next to a map over Sweden. The selected region(s) is highlighted. It is also possible to zoom in and out the <b>map,</b> <b>zoom</b> to full extent, zoom to selected region, pan the map and a some other functions. The third step was to connect the new tables in the database with the application. By expanding ArcView with its scripting language Avenue, a connection could be made between the new tables in the database and the application. The result is an application that researches can use to detect geographical connections concerning death in Sweden. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|Land {{and water}} {{information}} systems are developed {{for managing the}} information such as location, its limit, characteristic, structure, ownership if available and other relative attributes. For presenting the geographical locations {{of the land and}} water features, map based systems are being developed. Present day Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are map based systems which enable the interaction of several map layers for desired output. Most of the available WebGIS applications for land and water information are limited to selected features, such as roads, rivers, buildings and forest features. Some are limited to defined Geographical area, while only primary attribute values are displayed by some other applications. However, with the increment of requirements for WebGIS application, information and functions are being enhanced rapidly. When serving large data through a WebGIS application, performance tend to be slowed. Therefore it is important to identify the issues of WebGIS application in case of growing databases. Overall objective of the study is to identify the issues and concerns related to the development of Web GIS applications for growing databases and then to develop a land and water information system in order to identify management issues pertaining to the tool development associated with map serving and combined querying. The specific objectives of the research are: Identification of WebGIS performance issues with respect to the spatial coverage expansion and attribute expansion and development of a land and water management WebGIS tool with user friendly search capability considering possible expansion of coverage. As very first step, the issues of available web GIS applications are identified by a literature survey. Meanwhile, a evaluation on development methodology, performance optimization techniques and performance calculation methods is carried out. The work commenced with the development ofWebGIS application including information and functionality at basic level. According to the user survey, the application was enhanced for another three stages with growth of database and functional operations. The growth rate of database size second stage of the application is twice than first stage. While third stage growth rate is five times than second stage and fourth stage having about fifteen times of growth rate of features. The testing process of each stage was carried out to identify user familiarity, accuracy and performance level of the application. Performance level was identified by calculating the response time of functions at each stage. GeoInfo WebGIS application with better efficiency level of functionalities, user friendly features and high accuracy level is one of major results of this research. Functionalities ofWebGIS application are listed as (i) Query for land and water features, their attributes and relative features. (ii) Map the geographically location of water and land features and (iii) GIS operations such as location identification, measure length/area, <b>map</b> <b>zoom</b> in/out, pan map and vector and raster data layers loading. JavaScript, XML, HTML, and PHP are programming languages {{for the development of the}} application, while Postgis is selected as the database. Database to database functions take high response time of 22. 5 seconds in Version 4 while map to database ii having the 3. 42 seconds as minimum compared with first level ofWebGIS function categories. When considering all the functions are considered, ”Measure Tool Operation” has the minimum response time of 0. 42 seconds and Maximum is the 59. 2 seconds and it is the response time of ”Displaying list of Buildings” function. A rapid increment of response time is with functions of fourth versions. Other identified issues are non responsive situations with loading images, take more time to data loading and map overlaying when browsing and changing. By evaluating results of the verification process it is identified that database transactions directly affect the efficiency of functions ofWebGIS application. Reasons for Identified issues of WebGIS land and water management are (1). Issues with performance of stored procedure (2). No factor query index (3). Low efficient configuration of server (4). Issues with cache memory and (5). Trying to load heavy maps and data Recommendations for WebGIS development are (1). Database to database functions should be minimize as possible for the best performance of Water and land information management WebGIS application. (2). When serving the Raster and Polygon data, size should be in small components as possible. (3). Careful action should be taken when loading more than 10 or 20 records at a given tim...|$|E

Map overlay is performed by layering maps {{in the form}} of shapefiles over a raster map. In this paper map overlay is performed using uniform grid method. The shapefiles are placed one over the other using the coordinate information attached with these files. Satellite image (Raster <b>Map)</b> <b>zooming</b> enable users to view the inner details of the map which will provide a real world view. The proposed system achieves this by first tiling the image and then generating an image pyramid with these tiles.

40|$|Current sensor {{networks}} have limited use after deploy-ment {{due to the}} lack of ability to dynamically update sensing tasks to the networks. Assigning multiple tasks to multiple sensor groups in a sensor network deployed over a large geo-graphical region at fine granularity becomes problematic be-cause the sensors are heterogeneous, potentially mobile, and owned by users instead of network operators. We demon-strate Zoom [3], a multi-resolution tasking framework for crowdsourced geo-spatial sensor networks. The key idea in Zoom is decoupling the task specification from the task im-plementation using a spatial 2 -dimensional representation of the tasking region (e. g., <b>maps).</b> <b>Zoom</b> allows users to define sensor groups over heterogeneous, unstructured and mobile networks and assign different sensing tasks to each group. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a map based approach for mobile sensing systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Geo-located graph {{drawings}} often {{suffer from}} map visualization problems, such as overplotting of nodes {{as well as}} edges and location of parts of the graph being outside of the screen. One cause of these problems is often an irregular distribution of nodes on the <b>map.</b> <b>Zooming</b> and panning do not solve the problems, as they either only show the overview of the whole graph or only {{the details of a}} part of the graph. We present an interactive graph drawing technique that overcomes these problems without affecting the overall geographical structure of the graph. First, we introduce a method that uses insets to visualize details of small or remote areas. Second, to prevent the subgraphs within insets from overplotting and edge crossing, we introduce a local area re-arrangement. Moreover, insets are automatically drawn/hidden and repositioned in accordance with the user's navigation. We test our technique on real-world geo-located graph data and show the effectiveness of our approach for showing overview and details at the same time.
