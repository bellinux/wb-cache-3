In the work, signals coming from the vibration of the foot of the rail to the passage of a train are analyzed using STFT (Short Time Fourier Transform) and CWT (Continue Wavelet Transform). The vibration signals, generated by the passage of a train on the railway line, are non-stationary. So, techniques based on FT (Fourier Transform) and used for stationary signals are not suitable for the analysis and the characterization of this type of signals. When applying FT to a signal, the temporary information is lost.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} law of {{pledging}} as presented in the early Irish laws and draws connections to its relations within the overall system of security. At the centre of my research stands the question what pledges Irish law recognised and how their application was determined, so as to provide a paradigm for {{the law of}} pledging in its entirety. A pledge is usually a <b>movable,</b> <b>material</b> object of symbolic and economic worth that is given to another person as a security deposit for an outstanding obligation. The main findings of this thesis are a first paradigm {{of the law of}} pledging and a methodological and contextual categorisation of all types of pledges that opens doors for future research into property law. The combined discussion of pledges, hostages and sureties offers the reader insight into a triple method of security and its differences. Moreover, the close relationship between given pledges and distrained pledges is unravelled for the first time. Of further note is the comparative investigation into pledging. Therein, the reader is presented with how pledges are used in Welsh, Salic, Lombard, Visigothic, and Burgundian law. The objective is to offer the reader a view into the possibilities of pledging and to provide a framework against which the Irish evidence can be probed, which reveals how sophisticated and attentive to detail the Irish laws were. Finally, a translation of the primary source text Bretha im &# 7710;uillemu Gell (Judgements concerning Pledge-interests) is made available to the reader in the Appendix. </p...|$|E
40|$|In 1982 {{the castle}} in Radoszyce near Końskie, {{province}} of Kielce, {{was the subject}} of archeological and architectural investigations. The field-work resulted in an article (being published at the moment) devoted to the castle architecture and also in another paper (in press in our magazine no. 9) dealing with the initial analysis of the <b>movable</b> <b>material</b> of relics. Whereas, the object of the present study consists of other problems resulted from investigations led in Radoszyce. The first one is related with treasure-lumber-room situated {{in the area of the}} old castle. This structure during initial examinations was said to have been erected on the turn of the XVI and X VIIth century i. e. in the period when Radoszyce became a centre of big starosty district. In spite of many significant modifications the architectural mass of this late Rennaissance castle is still readable and the treasury-lumber-room itself needs more detailed research. It is of great importance since stone treasury-lumber-rooms of the XVIth and XVIth centuries are a real rarity. The second problem stressed in this article is a description of a wooden well found in excavation no. X-XA. Dug in the second half of the XVII 1 th century and of shell construction it was burried on the turn of the XVIIIth and XIXth century. The third problem also resulting from the effects of studies in Radoszyce was mentioned here as well. This castle played a role of so called foreststation of the king Władysław Jagiełło (1386 - 1434), The monarch did not like capital Cracow and the whole period of his long ruling spent on travelling. There were established routes leading in Polish and Lithuanian territories whose "loops" started and ended in the favourite residence of Jagiełło i. e. in the castle of Nowe Miasto Korczyn» Radoszyce situated on the route of royal journeys was visited 15 times by the king during his reign Among other stations of Władysław Jagiełło the following places should be listed here: in Little Poland (Jedlnia, Niepołomice, Przyszów end Żuków), in Russia (Medyka, Gliniany, Dobrostany), In Great Poland (Brodnia and Przedbórz) lying in the border of Great Poland and Little Poland. The author analyses the knowledge about the studied buildings which have distinct residential but at the same time fortified features. He finally concludes that we know very little about them. He suggests that the better knowledge of Władysław Jagiełło's favourite castles and fortified manors the better comprehension of his ruling system.

Institut za arheologiju iz Zagreba u suradnji s Muzejom grada Koprivnice, obavio je nastavak sustavnih arheoloπkih istraživanja na lokalitetu Ledine u Torčecu. Tim su iskopavanjima istraženi ostaci triju ranosrednjovjekovnih objekata. Prvi, manji objekt u očuvanom dijelu naglašeno je izduženoga ovaloidnog oblika, dok su druga dva kvadratičnoga oblika. Zapune objekata ispunjene su tamnosmeđesivom zemljom, ulomcima keramike, mnoštvom životinjskih zubiju i kostiju, lijepa te nešto metalnih predmeta. Osim ostataka triju objakata, evidentiran je i jedan kanal koji se protezao smjerom SZ-JI, zapunjen tamnosmeđesivom zemljom, garom i sporadičnim nalazima keramike, te jedan ovalni ukop zapunjen tamnosmeđesivom zemljom bez materijalnih ostataka. Prema pokretnim materijalnim ostacima, pronađenima u objektima, poglavito malih noževa kratkog sječiva, nekoliko tipova malih keramičkih pršljenova za ribarske mreže, koštanih alatki od kojih je zanimljiv harpun te metalnih većih i manjih udica, može se zaključiti da u gospodarstvu stanovnika naselja na Ledinama veliku ulogu igra ribolov. Uzrok napuštanju naselja koje je postojalo tijekom 10. i 11. stoljeća (prema C 14 analizi), vjerojatno je bilo plavljenje Drave. In {{the period}} from 10 July to 5 August 2004 the Institute for Archaeology from Zagreb in {{co-operation}} with the Koprivnica Town Museum, led by Tajana Sekelj Ivančan, Ph. D., continued systematic archaeological excavations at the Ledine site in Torčec (Appendix 1). In the excavations of 2004, three cultural fillings, or closed units, i. e. three early medieval structures were investigated (Appendix 2). One of the structures had a longitudinal oval shape, with rounded corners, and in the dark brown, 18 cm thick filling, dappled with soot, {{a small number of}} small ceramic fragments and some gravel were found. The second facility stood out as a dark rectangular stain. In the 0, 24 m thick filling, dappled with charcoal and soot, plenty of ceramic vessel and daub fragments, two smaller iron knives and sporadic animal bones were collected. The third structure is square in shape with apparently rounded corners and an extended part on the northern side. In the 63 cm thick filling a larger quantity of daub was found, as well as fragments of several ceramic vessels, a large number of animal bones and teeth, several iron artifacts, dross, six small ceramic whorls and a dressed bone artifact were found. The central part of the pit was the deepest, becoming “atter toward the margins, whereas three holes from wooden pillars were registered on the eastern and western margin of the pit (Fig. 1). In the subsequently conducted controls of a larger area a canal was registered, extending in NW-SE direction. In {{the upper part of the}} 65 cm thick canal filling sporadic finds of extraordinarily fragmentised ceramics and crushed gravel were unearthed, whereas a metal artifact - a harpoon - stands out. Somewhat more to the south of the canal an oval burial without any material remains was registered. According to <b>movable</b> <b>material</b> remains, particularly small short-bladed knives that were used to gut and scale fish, several types of small ceramic fishing net whorls, bone tools, of which the harpoon is particularly interesting, and larger and smaller metal hooks, we can conclude that the basic industry of the inhabitants of the settlement along the Drava River meander in Ledine was fishing. At a time when the meander was filled with water it was an inexhaustible source of food to the ancient population of Torčec. The river was probably also the direct cause for abandonment of the settlement. According to C 14 dating, the settlement existed in the tenth and eleventh centuries, and at that time or immediately thereafter there was probably a flood which, as the archaeological excavations show, destroyed the uppermost parts of the facilities and the presumed buildings between them.

40|$|Burg Cesargrad nalazi se na zapadnoj strani Cesarskog brda iznad kanjona Sutle zvanog Zelenjak, sjeverozapadno od Klanjca. Prilikom arheoloških istraživanja 2008. i 2010. istraženi su prostori kule H, njezine okolice i dijela južnog krila palasa. Analizom arhitektonskih ostataka, arheoloških nalaza i povijesnih izvora pokušale su se rekonstriurati faze razvoja burga od njegova nastanka do 16. stoljeća te definirati funkcija istraženih prostorija. The Cesargrad castle {{is one in}} {{a series}} of castles and fortresses in northwestern Croatia. It is {{situated}} northwest of the town of Klanjec, on the western side of the Cesargrad Hill, overlooking the Sutla River and its Zelenjak Gorge. Nowadays it stands at the very border of Croatia and Slovenia, with the castle of Kunšperk located on the latter side. Cesargrad was first mentioned in 1399, when it was owned by the Counts of Cilli. After the family became extinct in 1456, it shifted from one Styrian and Slavonian owner to another, finally passing down to the Erdödy family by the late 15 th century. An important date in the history of Cesargrad is January 29 th 1573, when the fortress suffered an attack by peasant troops during the Great Peasants’ Revolt. The Erdödy family renovated Cesargrad after that, however in the early 17 th century it is again mentioned as a ruin. Croatian Conservation Institute conducted archeological investigations of the castle in two campaigns, in 2008 and 2010. The 2008 investigations encompassed the square tower H, which is located in the northeastern corner of the central portion of the castle. Research included interior of the tower as well as its surrounding area. In 2010, excavations were conducted in the large room K of the southern wing of the Great Hall, i. e. the residential part of the castle core. Due to the fact that {{a large portion of the}} standing architecture is in poor condition, along with the archeological investigations, plans are underway for the conservation and structural improvement of this fine late medieval monument. In the course of both campaigns, a large amount of ceramic material was discovered, both of kitchen and table as well as technical ceramics, including the distinctively shaped Late Gothic stove tiles. Most of the kitchen ceramics amounts to coarsely-executed pottery, with a smaller portion of fine table ceramics. Chrono-typological analysis of the pottery rims dates the found material to the period from the mid- 14 th to early 16 th century. Most prevalent is the oxidation-fired ceramics in lighter tones, followed by reduction-fired ceramics, and again the reduction-fired ceramics that was subsequently exposed to oxidation atmosphere. The table ceramics and the green-glazed relief stove tiles are dated from the 15 th to the second half of the 16 th century. In addition to the remains of game animal bones that were found, the table ceramics and this type of stove tiles are indicative of a luxurious lifestyle of a part of the Cesargrad residents. Surprising is the distinctively small amount of fine glazed ceramics and majolica, considering that this was a residence of nobility. Analyses of the architectural remains and found <b>movable</b> <b>material</b> have revealed that the ground floor of tower H was one of Cesargrad’s kitchens. The type of elevated fireplace, embedded into the wall of the tower, in addition to the ceramics and stove tiles discovered, indicate that the tower was built during the 15 th century and was used into the second half of the 16 th century. The ground floor room of the southern wing of the Great Hall (K) was identified as a storage chamber, although it is possible to assume that it was the original Cesargrad kitchen. Rooms on the first floor, with large window openings, belonged to a representative portion of this castle. By way of analogies with castles in neighboring countries and the analysis of architecture, the early construction of the castle can be dated to the late 13 th and early 14 th century, i. e. much prior to its first mention in written sources...|$|E

40|$|MEMS (Microelectromechanical System) {{reliability}} {{has been}} a very important issue, especially for safety critical applications. Due to the diversity and multiple energy domains involved, MEMS devices are vulnerable to various failure mechanisms. MEMS reliability under different failure mechanisms should be analyzed separately. Since most of MEMS devices contain <b>movable</b> parts, <b>material</b> fatigue and aging under long-term repeated cycling load may lead to potential device failure, which in turn degrades the device reliability. In this paper, the reliability of poly-silicon MEMS comb accelerometers under material fatigue failure mechanism is analyzed. Based on ANSYS stress simulation, the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) lifetimes and failure rates for both BISR (built-in self-repairable) and non-BISR poly-silicon MEMS comb accelerometers are derived. Simulation results show that the fatigue lifetime of MEMS accelerometers made by poly-silicon material can be good enough for general purpose applications. However, for some 'weak' devices with certain structure defects, the material fatigue and aging may become potential threats. Compared to non-BISR design, BISR MEMS accelerometer demonstrates effective reliability improvement due to redundancy repair. MEMS reliability under material fatigue for other MEMS materials will be further studied in the future. [URL]...|$|R
50|$|Shiroka group burial mounds {{situated}} {{near the}} Shiroka village, situated around 1.5 km {{south of town}} of Suhareka (Theranda), stretches {{on the right side}} of the road. The Dardanian cultural group of the tumului, characteristic for the construction type with circle shaped graves, built by a mixture of earth and river stones, was identified at this site in 1953 by I.Nikolic, a worker of the Kosovo Museum. The excavations happened because some villagers of Shiroka had discovered some archaeological articles while planting their grape vines. Not far from this locality, a multilayer site of Hisar in one side and the Dubiçak burial mounds in the other side are situated. The past archaeological excavations carried here, resulted with the remains of a necropolis of the Bronze Age date and reused during the Late Iron Age. The discovered <b>movable</b> archaeological <b>material</b> composed of abundant and particular findings distinctive for the ornamented and decorated earthenware, most likely indicate that the vessels were imported and came through the trade and exchange from the Hellenic world and beyond. The necropolis of Shiroka, was erected during the 8th-6th century BC. In 1963 excavations were continued by J.Todorovic, when he dug out two of the eight tumuli of the Shiroka Necropolis, dating from the same period—i.e., 8th-6th century BC.|$|R
50|$|Ancient {{archaeological site}} of Banja e Pejës, {{situated}} in the crossroad that links Peja with Istog, is only 12 km northwest from Peja. During the construction period of Onyx hotel in 1974, a typical Illyrian military helmet was discovered accidentally. Apropos, the archaeological rescue excavations commenced at this site that resulted with abundant <b>movable</b> archeological <b>material</b> being discovered, while {{among the most important}} ones uncovered features a grave of an important pair of people that was named by the archeologists as The Royal Tomb. The couple's grave was constructed in the rectangular shape base and built with tuff stone plates, most probably extracted from the neighboring quarry. The recorded female grave contained rich grave goods material for example; fibula, omega shape needles, a ring and necklace decorated with geometrical motifs, forged in silver and bronze. On the other hand, the male burial grave contained the grave goods, personal belongings composed of; weapons, silver and bronze jewelry. The archaeological documentation of these important and valuable findings, among others, offers a picture of the time, characteristic for the social and economical differentiation of individuals or groups. Rich archaeological material discovered at this site belongs to the Late Iron Age, 6th-5th century BC. Surrounding micro region is rich on site and off site findings of different periods, confirming the continuity and occupancy of these most probably due to the great life conditions when having in mind the thermal water sources near this site. On the other hand, the landscape and geostrategic favorable position were ideal for selection of this locality to be inhabited during the long time period.|$|R
50|$|Paldenica is {{situated}} around 150 m {{on the left}} side of the Pristina-Skopje road, at the entrance of the village of Paldenica, above a hill which lays west from the village, on a terrain configuration of a shape of a horse, that has a broader overview of wider area of Lepenc gorge and the town of Hani i Elezit, an amount of surface visible remains of Roman pottery and bricks/tiles has been recorded in the past. Nevertheless, in 1967, at the area situated in the vicinity of the left river shore of Lepenc, couple of meters along the river bank stretched toward the Hani i Elezit, a Roman period necropolis was recorded. Numerous, <b>movable</b> archaeological <b>material</b> was collected and documented at this reconnaissance occasion, where a bronze cast belt decorated with glass pasta in the millefiori technique was found (a glasswork technique which producesdistinctive decorative patterns on glassware). The archaeological material dates chronologically sometime from the 2nd up to 3rd century AD, this a time period of the construction of necropolis of Paldenica. On the other hand, during the agricultural work carried out at the other side located on a hill part in 1995, a marble engraved and inscribed stelae of the Roman date was accidentally discovered (2nd- 3rd century AD).The stele has the following dimensions: 160 X 97 X 17,5 cm. Moreover, in another occasion, two bases for columns were discovered at the same place. Most likely, the site was a Roman date settlement and when considering the surrounding terrain configuration, presumably, if investigated further, traces of a Roman road station might be found somewhere close; it can be assumed since the road that linked ancient Scupi (Skopje) with Ulpiana, have passed through these parts.|$|R

5000|$|The Harilaq {{fortress}} (Kalaja e Harilaqit or Kështjella e Harilaqit, Градина, Gradina or Ариљача, Ariljača; 4th-6th century AD), {{is situated}} {{on top of}} the hill known by the local toponomy as the Gradina - Harilaq, set in an elevated and dominant position, west from the Ariljača village. The fortress is located in an altitude of maximum 766 metres above sea level, and is approximately sited 9 km southeast from the town of Kosovo Polje and only 2 kilometres west from Pristina International Airport [...] "Adem Jashari". The total surface of the fortress, also counting the circular walls/ ramparts, measures around 1.3 hectares of the inner space of the stronghold. The archaeological excavations at this site were conducted in several seasons, commencing in 2005 and were carried out systematically until 2010 by the staff of the Museum of Kosovo, particularly the Archaeological Institute of Kosovo. Nonetheless, several conservations and consolidations of the circuit walls were done in order to preserve the remains. During the five archaeological seasons' works, numerous remains and foundations of sacral, profane and utilitarian buildings were discovered. In regard, the entire outer sides of the rampart with towers at the axes were unearthed, as well as a church with three naves and a Saskrity are discovered, but also two almost identical structures in a rounded shape of an unknown sacral complex has been uncovered, as well. On the other hand, vast <b>movable</b> archaeological <b>material</b> composed of: metal made working tools, jewelry, coins, bricks, glass fragments and architectural structures, all clear indications that pinpoint to the Late Antique date and especially typical for the Justinian Period. Also, at this fortress traces of prehistoric periods have been evidenced, especially emphasizing the metal periods, but it continued to exist all through antiquity and up to the Medieval Period. Discovered and recorded findings from this site of excavations from 2005-2008 were presented at the International Conference on Illyria: Illyri Meridionale et l'Epire dans l'antiquite, Act du V colloque internacional de Grenoble, 8-11 octobre 2008, held in Grenoble, France.|$|R
