5|$|Monarchs of the Muhammad Ali dynasty reigned over Egypt from 1805 to 1953. Their rule also {{extended}} to Sudan {{throughout much of}} this period, {{as well as to}} the Levant, and Hejaz during the first half of the 19th century. The Muhammad Ali dynasty was founded by Muhammad Ali Pasha, an Albanian commander in the expeditionary force sent by the Ottoman Empire in 1801 to dislodge the French occupation of Egypt led by Napoleon Bonaparte. The defeat and departure of the French left a power vacuum in Egypt, which had been an Ottoman province since the 16th century, but in which the pre-Ottoman Mamluk military caste maintained considerable power. After a three-year civil war, Muhammad Ali managed to consolidate his control over Egypt, and declared himself Khedive of the country. The Ottoman Porte refused to acknowledge this title, instead recognizing Muhammad Ali by the more junior title of Wāli (meaning governor or viceroy) on 18 June 1805, making Muhammad Ali the successor to Ahmad Khurshid Pasha in that position. In the years following his consolidation of power, Muhammad Ali extended Egypt's borders south into Sudan, and eastwards into the Arab <b>Mashreq,</b> particularly the Levant. In 1840, his demand for hereditary control of Egypt and Sudan to be passed to his heirs and successors was accepted and confirmed by the Convention of London, but he was compelled to agree that, upon his death, control over his territories in the <b>Mashreq</b> would revert to the Porte.|$|E
25|$|The {{educational}} {{reforms of}} the nineteenth century, a period of sweeping social, economic and political transition, resulted from various undercurrents occurring at different levels within the realms of the Ottoman Empire from the <b>Mashreq</b> (Greater Syria) to the Maghreb (North Africa). These trends were largely attributable to the increased European {{presence in the region}} and their secular ideas of modernity.|$|E

2500|$|Damascus {{became the}} {{coordinating}} {{center of the}} Arab nationalist movement as it {{was seen as the}} birthplace of the ideology, the seat of Faysal—the first Arab [...] "sovereign" [...] after nearly 400 years of Turkish suzerainty—and because the nationalists of the entire <b>Mashreq</b> region were familiar with it. Nonetheless, Jerusalem, Beirut, and Baghdad remained significant bases of support. Following the creation of Faysal's state, a serious tension within the Arab nationalist movement became visible; the conflict between the ideology's highest ideal of forming a single independent unit comprising all countries that shared the Arabic language and heritage, and the tendency to give precedence to local ambitions.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1860s, {{literature}} {{produced in}} the <b>Mashreq</b> (the Levant and Mesopotamia) which was under Ottoman control at the time, contained emotional intensity and strongly condemned the Ottoman Turks for [...] "betraying Islam" [...] and the Fatherland to the Christian West. In the view of Arab patriots, Islam had not always been in a [...] "sorry state" [...] and attributed the military triumphs and cultural glories of the Arabs to {{the advent of the}} religion, insisting that European modernism itself was of Islamic origin. The Ottomans, on the other hand, had deviated from true Islam and thus suffered decline. The reforming Ottoman and Egyptian governments were blamed for the situation because they attempted to borrow Western practices from the Europeans that were seen as unnatural and corrupt. The Arab patriots' view was that the Islamic governments should revive true Islam that would in turn, pave way for the establishment of constitutional representative government and freedom which, though Islamic in origin, was manifested in the West at the time.|$|E

Mohamed Alnahdi, executive manager of <b>Mashreq,</b> negotiated with the pirates for over a month, but failed to secure the fishermen's release after the pirates, originally demanding 800,000 to $1.5 million, rejected a ransom of $200,000.|$|E

5000|$|The {{origins of}} pan-Arabism are often {{attributed}} to Jurji Zaydan (1861-1914) and his Nahda (Revival) movement. Zaydan had critical influence on {{acceptance of a}} modernized version of the Quranic Arabic language (Modern Standard Arabic) as the universal written and official language throughout the Arab world, instead of adoption of local dialects in the various countries. He also popularized through his historical novels certain heroes from Arab history. Pan-Arabism was first pressed by Sharif Hussein ibn Ali, the Sharif of Mecca, who sought independence for the <b>Mashreq</b> Arabs from the Ottoman Empire, {{and the establishment of}} a unified Arab state in the <b>Mashreq.</b> In 1915 and 1916, the Hussein-McMahon Correspondence resulted in an agreement between the United Kingdom and the Sharif that if the <b>Mashreq</b> Arabs revolted successfully against the Ottomans, the United Kingdom would support claims for <b>Mashreq</b> Arab independence. In 1916, however, the Sykes-Picot Agreement between the United Kingdom and France determined that parts of the <b>Mashreq</b> would be divided between those powers rather than forming part of an independent Arab state. When the Ottoman Empire surrendered in 1918, the United Kingdom refused to keep to the letter of its arrangements with Hussein, and the two nations assumed guardianship of Mesapotamia, Lebanon, Palestine and what became modern Syria. Ultimately, Hussein became King of only Hijaz, in the then less strategically valuable south, but lost his Caliphate throne when the kingdom was sacked by the Najdi Ikhwan forces of the Saudites and forcefully incorporated into the newly created Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.A more formalized pan-Arab ideology than that of Hussein was first espoused in the 1930s, notably by Syrian thinkers such as Constantin Zureiq, Sati' al-Husri, Zaki al-Arsuzi and Michel Aflaq. Aflaq and al-Arsuzi were key figures in the establishment of the Arab Ba’ath (Renaissance) Party, and the former was for long its chief ideologist, combining elements of Marxist thought with a nationalism to a considerable extent reminiscent of nineteenth-century European romantic nationalism. It has been said that Arsuzi was fascinated with the Nazi ideology of [...] "racial purity" [...] and impacted Aflaq.|$|E
