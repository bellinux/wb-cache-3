5|$|The late stelae at Seibal show {{a marked}} {{reduction}} in quality over {{a span of}} about forty years, {{with the loss of}} Classic Period traits, and bearing flatter and cruder representations than earlier stelae. This <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> loss of expertise in the Terminal Classic, with craftsmen less able to work monuments and large structures as time progressed.|$|E
5|$|Apparently Constantine did not patronize Christianity alone. After gaining {{victory in}} the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312), a triumphal arch—the Arch of Constantine—was built (315) to {{celebrate}} his triumph. The arch is decorated with images of the goddess Victoria. At {{the time of its}} dedication, sacrifices to gods like Apollo, Diana, and Hercules were made. Absent from the Arch are any depictions of Christian symbolism. However, as the Arch was commissioned by the Senate, the absence of Christian symbols <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> role of the Curia at the time as a pagan redoubt.|$|E
5|$|In larval lampreys, {{the thyroid}} {{originates}} as an exocrine gland, secreting its hormones into the gut, and {{associated with the}} larva's filter-feeding apparatus. In the adult lamprey, the gland separates from the gut, and becomes endocrine, but this path of development <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> evolutionary origin of the thyroid. For instance, the closest living relatives of vertebrates, the tunicates and Amphioxus, have a structure {{very similar to that}} of larval lampreys (the endostyle), and this also secretes iodine-containing compounds (albeit not thyroxine).|$|E

5|$|Prior to Pulos and Hutt's work, {{researchers}} were {{split on the}} mode of inheritance of white and whether it was deleterious (harmful). Recent research has discovered several possible genetic pathways to a white coat, so disparities in these historical findings <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> action of different genes. It {{is also possible that}} the varied origins of Pulos and Hutt's white horses might be responsible for the lack of homozygotes. Therefore, it remains to be proven whether all equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic lethality in the homozygous state.|$|E
5|$|Several other {{significant}} events occurred around 42 Ma, including cessation of metamorphism of the Leech River Schists (resulting from the Metchosin/Crescent Formation being thrust under Vancouver Island) {{and the end}} of strike-slip motion on the Straight Creek Fault; these <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> last movement of Siletzia relative to North America. On a broader scale, there was a change in absolute direction of the Pacific plate (marked {{by the end of the}} bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain), and a change in the convergence of the Kula plate with the North American plate.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after it returned to Baghdad, in January 803, the Abbasid court witnessed the abrupt {{fall of the}} Barmakid family from power. On the one hand, this decision <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> fact that the Barmakids may have become indeed too powerful for the Caliph's liking, but its timing suggests that it was tied to the succession issue as well: with al-Amin siding with the abnaʾ and al-Ma'mun with the Barmakids, and the two camps becoming more estranged every day, if al-Amin {{was to have a}} chance to succeed, the power of the Barmakids had to be broken. Indeed, the years after the fall of the Barmakids saw an increasing centralization of the administration and the concomitant rise of the influence of the abnaʾ, many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from Baghdad.|$|E

5|$|There {{are nine}} Twin-Pyramid Complexes at Tikal, {{one of which}} was {{completely}} dismantled in ancient times and some others were partly destroyed. They vary in size but consist of two pyramids facing each other on an east–west axis. These pyramids are flat-topped and have stairways on all four sides. A row of plain stelae is placed immediately {{to the west of the}} eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramids, and lying roughly equidistant from them, there is usually a sculpted stela and altar pair. On the south side of these complexes there is a long vaulted building containing a single room with nine doorways. The entire complex was built at once and these complexes were built at 20-year (or k'atun) intervals during the Late Classic. The first twin pyramid complex was built in the early 6th century in the East Plaza. It was once thought that these complexes were unique to Tikal but rare examples have now been found at other sites, such as Yaxha and Ixlu, and they <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> extent of Tikal's political dominance in the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, Portugal was {{the only}} European country to utilize the Portuguese dogfish. An {{important}} bycatch of the black scabbardfish (Aphanops carbo) longline fishery, between 300 and 900 tons of this shark were landed annually from 1986 to 1999. Its per-weight value has been increasing since 1986, and thus exploitation is likely to continue. Around 1990, French bottom trawlers began to fish for Portuguese dogfish and leafscale gulper sharks (Centrophorus squamosus) west of the British Isles for meat and livers; these two species are together referred to as siki. The siki catch peaked at 3,284 tons in 1996 before declining to 1,939 tons in 1999. The French have since been joined by Norwegian, Irish, and Scottish longliners and trawlers, making the Portuguese dogfish a significant component of deepwater fisheries in the northwest Atlantic. While stocks off Portugal seem to be stable for now, stocks off the British Isles have diminished substantially in recent years; this <b>may</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> disparity between the less massified Portuguese fishery and the commercial French fishery. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, because of its commercial value and low reproductive productivity.|$|E
