Transmitters can also be connected through the premises' electrical circuits to transmit coded signals to the control unit (line carrier). The control unit usually has a separate channel or zone for burglar and fire sensors, and better systems have a separate zone for every different sensor, as well as internal trouble indicators (<b>mains</b> <b>power</b> <b>loss,</b> low battery, broken wire, etc.).|$|E

50|$|An {{uninterruptible}} {{power supply}} (UPS) uses batteries and an inverter to supply AC <b>power</b> when <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> is not available. When <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> is restored, a rectifier supplies DC power to recharge the batteries.|$|R
40|$|Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs) provide {{short-term}} power {{back-up to}} sensitive electronic and electrical equipments, where an unexpected <b>power</b> <b>loss</b> {{could lead to}} undesirable outcomes. They usually bridge the connected equipment between the utility <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> and other long term back-up power systems like generators. A UPS also provides a “clean” source of power, meaning they filter the connected equipment from distortions in electrical parameters of the <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> like noise, harmonics, surges, sags and spikes. A surge resistant UPS or SRUPS {{is one that has}} the capability to withstand surges, which are momentary or sustained increases in the mains voltage, and react quickly enough to offer protection to the connected equipment from the same. Usually UPSs run off battery power when the utility <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> is absent. But the SRUPS developed in this design project uses super capacitors instead of battery packs. The {{reason for this is that}} the high energy-densities and medium power-densities offered by super capacitors allow for it to serve two purposes. One is to provide the DC power to operate the UPS in the absence of <b>mains</b> <b>power,</b> as an alternative to batteries. Secondly, super capacitors can withstand heavy momentary high current/voltage surges due to its high energy-density characteristics. Also as the life-time of super capacitors is much higher than that of conventional batteries and as they do not need regular topping-up or inspection, the end result is a truly maintenance-free UPS. Most commercial UPSs do not have inherent surge protection capabilities. The UPS is one entity while a discrete surge protection module is inserted between the utility mains and the UPS to provide for transient surge suppression. In the proposed SRUPS, the super capacitor, because of their inherent capability to absorb transient surges, forms a protective front end to the actual UPS rather than needing to have the involvement of discrete protection devices...|$|R

50|$|The TOD clock's {{internal}} circuitry {{is designed to}} be driven by either 50 or 60 Hz clock signal, which can be inexpensively derived from the <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> source AC, resulting in a stable timekeeper with little long-term drift. The ability to work with both power line frequencies allowed a single version of the 6526 to be used in computers operated in countries with either 50 or 60 Hz <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> lines. It {{is important to note that}} contrary to the popular belief, NTSC or PAL video standards are not directly linked to <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> frequency. Additionally, some computers did not derive their TOD clock frequency from the <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> source. For example, both NTSC and PAL variants of Commodore SX-64 use 60 Hz TOD clock supplied by a dedicated crystal. KERNAL operating system in Commodore 64 for example will determine the video standard during system startup, but tries neither to identify the supplied TOD clock frequency nor to initialise the CIAs correctly on 50 Hz driven machines. Thus, it is the responsibility of any application software that wants to use either CIA's TOD function to determine the supplied frequency and set the CIA(s) flag accordingly itself. Failure to do so may cause the clock to deviate quickly from the correct time.|$|R

50|$|A third {{application}} of baluns in audio systems {{is in the}} provision of balanced <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> to the equipment. Due to the common-mode rejection of interference characteristic of balanced <b>mains</b> <b>power,</b> a wide range of noise coming from the wall plug is eliminated, e.g. mains-borne interference from air conditioner/furnace/refrigerator motors, switching noise produced by fluorescent lighting and dimmer switches, digital noise from personal computers, and radio frequency signals picked up by the power lines/cords acting as antennae. This noise infiltrates the audio/video system through the power supplies and raises the noise floor of the entire system.|$|R
