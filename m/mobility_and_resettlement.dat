40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a summary of}} the results of a social survey. The survey was {{one of a series of}} studies of social aspects of urban redevelopment and housing provision which the Department of Social Science, University College Dublin, began in 1966 with the encouragement and financial assistance of the Human Sciences Committee. It was primarily an attempt to ascertain the effects of the move to a new housing estate on the lives of the people concerned. Patterns of <b>mobility</b> <b>and</b> <b>resettlement</b> and difficulties encountered in living in a new area were examined in some detail and the aim was to obtain an empirically-based profile of one of the new communities which are a feature of contemporary Dublin. The survey was concerned with preferences about where to live, the implications of the move to a new area for employment, family problems m a new area, patterns of recreation, the housewives 2 ̆ 7 ideas and suggestions about housing design and estate layout, aspirations regarding children 2 ̆ 7 s education and married women 2 ̆ 7 s interest and involvement in employment...|$|E
40|$|The rate {{at which}} people move and resettle {{around the world is}} unprecedented. <b>Mobility</b> <b>and</b> <b>resettlement</b> is now greatly {{assisted}} by the use of inexpensive internet communication technologies (ICTs) {{for a wide variety of}} functions: to communicate locally and across territories, for localised information seeking, geo – locational mapping and for forging new social connections in host countries and cities. This article is based on a qualitative study of newly arrived migrants and mobile people from non English speaking backgrounds (NESB) to the city of Brisbane, Australia and investigates how the internet is used to assist the initial period of settling into the city. As increasing amounts of essential information is placed online, the study asks how people from NESB communities manage to negotiate the types of information they require during the early stages of resettlement, given varying levels of access to ICTs, digital and language literacy. The study finds that the internet is widely used for specific location information seeking (such as accommodation and job-seeking), but this is often supplemented with other non-mediated sources of information. The study identified implications for social policy in regard to the resourcing and access of information. While findings are specific to the study location, it is feasible that the patterns of internet use for resettlement have relevance in a broader context...|$|E

Merlinda Bobis, Jigzie Campbell, Lella Carridi and Vincenza Fazzalori, Ok-Hean Chang, Mehwish Iqbal, Helen Kassa, Hiromi Tango, My Le Thi, Yumi Umiumare and Sivan Gabrielovitch have been participating in a community research project Art/Hope/Culture: Empowering Women’s Art and Culture that explored the impact of intercultural <b>mobilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>resettlement</b> on their art and their art making processes. Researchers Anne Harris and Enza Gandolfo have engaged in dialogue with the artists and documented these in a series of short films (included in the exhibition along with the artwork) that celebrate, explore and promote the artists’ work and valuable contributions to Australian art and cultural life. The artworks represent a range of disciplines including film, visual arts, performance, literature and multi-modalities. The exhibition was held at the Footscray Community Arts Centre in March 2014 and opened by author Alice Pun...|$|R

40|$|Tuvalu is a Pacific atoll {{nation-state}} {{that has}} come to stand for predicaments implicating climate change, forced emigration <b>and</b> <b>resettlement,</b> <b>and</b> loss of territory and sovereignty. Legal and policy remedies seek to address such challenges by radically reframing how sovereignty is conceived. Drawing on literary and legal theory, we seek to extend such work in the terms of cultural geography and anthropology by considering how the archipelago and cultural practices known as fenua could be deployed as symbolic and material resources emphasizing <b>mobility</b> <b>and</b> connection, in contrast to normative ideas of sovereignty, whose orientation to territory imperils atoll states. Our fundamental argument is that legal and policy reforms addressing climate change emigration must be enriched by accounting for the emotional geographies that attend the changing real and conceptual borders of sovereignty and by creating alternative spaces of hope and action...|$|R

40|$|Migrant transnationalism has {{typically}} {{been associated}} with voluntary migrants. Its connection with <b>mobility,</b> <b>and</b> particularly regular returns {{to the point of}} origin, initially precluded refugees and other groups of forced migrants. More recently, however, it has also raised interest in the context of refugee movement (Al Ali et al 2001). Of the three traditionally conceived durable solutions for refugees, two of them, <b>resettlement</b> <b>and</b> return, do require international mobility. Work on refugee transnationalism has also been encouraged, in part, by a change of emphasis to the non-mobile aspects of transnational linkages, that are particularly relevant in the case of local integration <b>and</b> <b>resettlement</b> but also in the large number of unresolved refugee situations. It is therefore not surprising that transnationalism formed a significant theme of the ninth biennial conference of the International Association for the Study of Forced Migration, that was held in São Paul...|$|R
