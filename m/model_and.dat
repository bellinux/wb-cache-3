40|$|This chapter {{develops}} a descriptive-conceptual {{overview of the}} main <b>models</b> <b>and</b> standards of processes formulated in the systems engineering (SE), software engineering (SwE) and information systems (IS) disciplines. Given the myriad of <b>models</b> <b>and</b> standards reported, the convergence suggested for the SE <b>and</b> SwE <b>models</b> <b>and</b> standards and the increasing complexity of the modern information systems, we argue that these ones become relevant in the information systems discipline. Firstly, we report the ratio- nale for having <b>models</b> <b>and</b> standards of processes in SE, SwE and IS. Secondly, we review their main Overview of <b>Models</b> <b>and</b> Standards of Processes in the SE, SwE, and IS Disciplines characteristics. Thirdly, based on the identified aims and principles, we report and posit the concepts of process, system and service as conceptual building blocks for describing such <b>models</b> <b>and</b> standards. Finally, initial theoretical and practical implications for the information systems discipline of such <b>models</b> <b>and</b> standards are discussed, as well as recommendations for further research are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Practitioners {{of the art}} {{and science}} of pharmacometrics {{are well aware of}} the {{considerable}} effort required to successfully complete <b>modeling</b> <b>and</b> simulation activities for drug development programs. This is particularly true because of the current, ad hoc implementation wherein <b>modeling</b> <b>and</b> simulation activities are piggybacked onto traditional development programs. This effort, coupled with the failure to explicitly design development programs around <b>modeling</b> <b>and</b> simulation, will continue to be an important obstacle, to the successful transition to model-based drug development. Challenges with timely data availability, high data discard rates, delays in completing <b>modeling</b> <b>and</b> simulation activities, and resistance of development teams to the use of <b>modeling</b> <b>and</b> simulation in decision making are all symptoms of an immature process capability for performing <b>modeling</b> <b>and</b> simulation...|$|R
