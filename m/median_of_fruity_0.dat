Hexanal, heptanal, octanal and decanal were also present, as were their primary alcohols and several alkanes, possibly representing oxidation ladders (Monsoor et al. 2004), with beneficial outcomes for the aromatic profile of the rice.|$|R

50|$|The grapes used at Saint-Chinian are Carignan, Cinsault, Grenache, Lledoner Pelut, Mourvèdre and Syrah. Syrah (used to {{ameliorate}} the wines), Mourvèdre and Grenache represent approximately 70% of the grapes grown on the land. The Carignan grape {{is used in}} the making of red wines, while the Cinsault grape is better for the making <b>of</b> <b>fruity</b> rosé wines. Certain wine-growers offer 100% Carignan vines, but as Vin de Table as these products, which are not blends as required by the AOC regulations, cannot be sold under the Saint-Chinian AOC designation.|$|R
50|$|Steinbier is not mashed in kettles, but in wooden tubs. Its name {{is derived}} from the hot stones that were put into the mashing tubs to achieve the {{required}} temperature for production. Due to the contact of the glowing, hot stones - often heated directly in the fire - with the malt, the resulting beer has a taste of caramel and soot. This was a traditional brewing process; top-fermenting yeasts and a taste <b>of</b> <b>fruity</b> ester were usual and there was no emphasis on long term storability. Steinbier was usually not filtered.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{hydrogen}} sulfide (H 2 S), methanethiol (MeSH) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) on the odor properties of three wine models-WM- (young white, young red and oaked red wines) was studied. Wine models were built by mixing {{a pool of}} common wine volatile and non-volatile compounds and further spiked with eight different combinations of the three sulfur compounds present at two levels (level 0 : 0 mu g L- 1 and level 1 : 40 mu g L- 1 of H 2 S, 12 mu g L- 1 of MeSH; 55 mu g L- 1 of DMS). For each wine matrix eight WMs were produced and further submitted to sensory description by Rate-All-That-Apply (RATA) method. Hydrogen sulfide and methanethiol were clearly involved {{in the formation of}} reductive aromas and shared the ability to act as strong suppressors <b>of</b> <b>fruity</b> and floral attributes. Specifically, hydrogen sulfide generated aromas of rotten eggs, while methanethiol generated significant increases in camembert and decreases in citrus, smoky/roasted and oxidation aromas. The simultaneous presence of hydrogen sulfide and methanethiol enhanced the intensity of the unspecific term reduction, while the specific nuances individually imparted by each of the two compounds could not be further identified. DMS did not exert any outstanding effect on the reductive character of wines and its sensory effect was matrix-dependent. It was involved in the formation <b>of</b> <b>fruity</b> notes such as cooked/candied and red/black fruits in young wines, and vegetal notes (canned vegetables) in (Naked red WMs...|$|R

Other preparations, known colloquially as [...] "shrubs", range from simply mixing sugar water or honey water with small amounts <b>of</b> <b>fruity</b> vinegar, to making syrup by laying fruit or mint in vinegar essence for several days, then sieving off solid parts, and adding considerable amounts of sugar.
