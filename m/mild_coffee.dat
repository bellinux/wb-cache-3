25|$|Coffee {{berries and}} their seeds undergo several {{processes}} {{before they become}} the familiar roasted coffee. Berries have been traditionally selectively picked by hand; a labor-intensive method, it involves the selection of only the berries {{at the peak of}} ripeness. More commonly, crops are strip picked, where all berries are harvested simultaneously regardless of ripeness by person or machine. After picking, green coffee is processed by one of two methods—the dry process method, simpler and less labor-intensive as the berries can be strip picked, and the wet process method, which incorporates fermentation into the process and yields a <b>mild</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Pali Canon, the scripture of Theravada Buddhism, depicts refraining {{from alcohol}} as {{essential}} to moral conduct because intoxication causes a loss of mindfulness. The fifth of the Five Precepts states, [...] "Surā-meraya-majja-pamādaṭṭhānā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi." [...] In English: [...] "I undertake to refrain from meraya and majja (the two fermented drinks used in the place and time of writing) to heedless intoxication." [...] Although the Fifth Precept only names a specific wine and cider, this has traditionally been interpreted to mean all alcoholic beverages. Technically, this prohibition does also not even include light to moderate drinking, only {{to the point of}} drunkenness. It also doesn't include other mind-altering drugs, but Buddhist tradition includes all intoxicants. The canon does not suggest that alcohol is evil but believes that the carelessness produced by intoxication creates bad karma. Therefore, any drug (beyond tea or <b>mild</b> <b>coffee)</b> that affects one's mindfulness be considered by some to be covered by this prohibition.|$|E
30|$|Colombia {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} countries for production of <b>mild</b> <b>coffee</b> (Coffea arabica L.), with over 870, 000 Ha planted (Federacafé 2010). The coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytidae), is the most significant pest of the Colombian coffee crop, and it is found in all the coffee-growing regions of the world (Benavides et al. 2012; Bustillo 2002). Female insects fly towards coffee beans and bore into them until reaching the seed endocarpium, where they deposit their eggs. After the eggs hatch, larvae feed on the seed, causing weight loss in the grain, decreasing quality due to fungal contamination, and the falling of small cherries to the ground (Duque et al. 1997).|$|E
50|$|In 1989, ICO {{failed to}} reach an {{agreement}} on new export quotas, causing the 1983 ICA to break down. The disagreement was triggered by consumers' change in taste towards milder and higher quality coffee. With the retained quotas from the 1983 agreement, the change increased the value of <b>milder</b> <b>coffee</b> at the expense of more traditional varieties such as robusta. Brazil in particular - the world's most powerful coffee producer - refused to reduce its quotas believing it would lower their market share. The consumers, led by the United States, demanded higher quality coffee and the end of selling coffee to non-members at reduced rates.|$|R
5000|$|A Wiener Melange (German for [...] "Viennese Blend") is a {{speciality}} coffee drink {{similar to}} a cappuccino. The difference is sometimes assumed {{to be that the}} Melange is made with <b>milder</b> <b>coffee</b> [...] but the Viennese coffee company Julius Meinl describes a Wiener Melange as [...] "one espresso shot served in a large coffee cup topped with steamed milk and milk foam". [...] Cafe Sabarsky in Manhattan concurs. At Cafe Sperl in Vienna, the Melange is half a cup of [...] "black coffee" [...] and half a cup [...] "creamy milk", topped with milk foam. Nescafe, Movenpick, and Lufthansa Catering however serve Wiener Melange as Coffee blended with Cocoa - no matter whether foam topped or not. Kaffeehaus de Chatillon describes it as relatively equal portions of coffee, milk and cream foam in a 6oz cup.|$|R
50|$|Edmund Angel Abel, Jr. (May 12, 1921 - April 21, 2014) was an American {{engineer}} and inventor who designed and patented the heating element for Mr. Coffee, {{one of the}} first automatic drip coffee makers to be introduced to the American consumer market. Mr. Coffee, which was first sold in 1972, soon became the dominant coffeemaker in the United States, reaching sales of approximately $150 million by the late 1970s. Abel's invention, the heating element, brewed a <b>milder</b> <b>coffee</b> than traditional methods, largely replaced the percolator in American homes. Home Furnishings News listed Mr. Coffee {{as one of the most}} important household consumer products introduced in the previous seventy-five years in a list published in 2002. Prior to his work on the coffeemaker, he held patents in film developing and aviation. Despite his role in the invention of the Mr. Coffee machine, Abel did not drink coffee.|$|R
40|$|Spent {{coffee ground}} (SCG) is the solid residue {{obtained}} from the treatment of coffee powder with hot water to prepare instant coffee, and constitutes the main coffee industry residue. Finding alternatives for the reuse of this residue is of great interest from economical and environmental viewpoints. The goal {{of the present study}} was to use this residue as raw material for the production of a new distilled beverage. The process for elaboration of this beverage consisted in an initial extraction of the aromatic compounds from SCG with water, followed by the fermentation of this extract in a bench bioreactor and subsequently distillation of the fermented broth. The produced drink contained 40 % v/v ethanol, and presented <b>mild</b> <b>coffee</b> flavor. Several volatile compounds were identified in this distillate among of which, higher alcohols were quantitatively the most abundant group. Isoamyl alcohol (3 -methyl- 1 -butanol), isobutanol (2 -methyl- 1 -propanol), and 2 -methyl- 1 - butanol were the higher alcohols found in major quantities (810, 269, and 185 mg/l, respectively), contributing thus for the greatest proportion of the total aroma and essential character. Ethyl acetate and acetaldehyde, which are also volatile compounds of large influence on the flavor of alcoholic beverages, were found in SCG distillate in concentrations of 38 mg/l and 80 mg/l, respectively. On the other hand, methanol that is a compound harmful to the health was found at low level (11 mg/l). Considering the flavor, the volatile compounds present, and the ratio between isoamyl alcohol/ 2 - methyl- 1 -propanol and 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol/ 1 -propanol, which are indicative of the quality of alcoholic beverages and have to be higher than unity, it was concluded that a novel spirit of acceptable organoleptic character can be produced by fermentation using SCG as raw material. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
50|$|Consumers' {{change in}} taste towards milder and higher quality coffee {{triggered}} a disagreement over export quotas of the International Coffee Agreement {{in the end}} of the 1980s. With the retained quotas from the 1983 agreement, the change increased the value of <b>milder</b> <b>coffee</b> at the expense of more traditional varieties. Brazil in particular refused to reduce its quotas believing it would lower their market share. The consumers, led by the United States, demanded higher coffee quality and the end of selling coffee to non-members at reduced rates. US officials criticized Brazil for not being willing to accept a reduction of the country's quotas despite falling share of the world market since 1980. Jorio Dauster, head of the state-controlled Brazilian Coffee Institute, believed Brazil could survive without help from the agreement. Not being able to reach an agreement in a timely manner, the agreement broke down in 1989. As a result, the Brazilian Coffee Institute, previously controlling the price of coffee by regulating the amount grown and sold, was abolished to limit government interference in favor of free markets. Up to this point the industry had simply neglected quality control management because government regulations favored scale economies, but now coffee processors begun exploring higher quality segments in contrast to the traditionally lower quality.|$|R
25|$|During the 20th century, Colombia {{became the}} number one {{producer}} and exporter of premium <b>mild</b> washed <b>coffee</b> in the world. This {{has been a very}} significant achievement, attained by the combined efforts of the private sector, the gremial organizations and the Federation's institutions. The successful model of Colombian coffee production and commerce is the outcome of a well balanced combination of efficient private enterprise and a well planned macroeconomic policy by the government. This economic model has become the organizational archetype for more than fifty coffee producing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.|$|R
40|$|While the U. S. {{remains the}} worldÂ’'s largest coffee importer, {{consumption}} of the good has dramatically changed {{in the past few}} decades. This study evaluates the influences of U. S. consumption habits, prices of coffees by origin, prices of near substitutes, U. S. income, the ICA, and NAFTA on U. S. consumption of three categories of Arabica coffee- Colombian milds, Mexican and other milds, and Brazilian. Results indicate that U. S. consumption of Mexican coffee is sensitive to its own price; price of Colombian coffee, which appears to be its largest competitor; and ICA controls. Under NAFTA, Mexico appears well positioned to gain increased U. S. market share of shade-grown <b>mild</b> Arabica <b>coffee.</b> Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|R
30|$|The {{study of}} biomass {{extracts}} as metal corrosion inhibitors is beneficial for several reasons: they are inexpensive, readily available, nontoxic, {{and on the}} basis of their multi-constituent composition, could provide broad spectrum action (as opposed to the specificity of action of conventional organic inhibitors). These are attractive and desirable features for next generation corrosion inhibitors. Accordingly, the present report continues to focus on the broadening application of biomass extracts for metallic corrosion control and reports on the inhibiting effect of the leaf extract of coffee senna (CS) on the acid corrosion of <b>mild</b> steel. <b>Coffee</b> senna belongs to the family, Fabaceae, and is generally found in tropical and coastal plains of Africa and America. Extensive phytochemical characterization revealed that the plant is rich in anthraquinones, emodin glycosides, achrosine, chrysophanol, aloe-emodine, quercetine, rhamnosides, rhein, and vitexin alkaloids[40, 41, 42]. The plant is used in traditional medicine against throat inflammation, colds, asthma, fever, flu and as anti venom[43].|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates long-run {{relationships}} among the spot prices of four coffee types. We find two cointegrating vectors: one between the prices of Other <b>Milds</b> and Colombian <b>coffee,</b> {{and the other one}} between Unwashed Arabicas and Robustas. Following Pesaran and Shin (1996), persistence profile analysis of the two cointegrating vectors shows a rapid adjustment towards their equilibrium value. This suggests that the four coffee markets are highly related, and that discrepancies in the equilibrium relationships are short-lived. Out of sample evaluation of the model is reasonably good, except for two occasions of sharp price increases following adverse weather conditions. PRICING...|$|R
5000|$|Coffee {{production}} in Colombia {{has a reputation}} as producing <b>mild,</b> well balanced <b>coffee</b> beans. [...] Colombia's average annual coffee production of 11.5 million bags is the third total highest in the world, after Brazil and Vietnam; though highest in terms of the arabica bean. The beans are exported to United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Italy. Most coffee is grown in the Colombian coffee growing axis region. In 2007, the European Union granted Colombian coffee a protected designation of origin status. [...] In 2011 UNESCO declared the “Coffee Cultural Landscape” of Colombia, a World Heritage site.|$|R
6000|$|My {{situation}} has, en attendant, {{been made}} picturesque by the successive arrivals of your different mementoes, {{each one of}} which has done its little part to assuage my solitude and relieve my gloom. Putting them in their order, Mrs. Wharton comes in an easy first; the unspeakable Postum follows handsomely, and Protoplasm--by which I mean Plasmon--pants far behind. How shall I thank you properly for these prompt and valued missives? Postum does taste like a ferociously <b>mild</b> coffee--a <b>coffee</b> reduced to second childhood, the prattle of senility. I hasten to add, however, that it accords thereby but the better with my enfeebled powers of assimilation, and that I am taking it regular and blessing your name for it. It interposes a little ease after the long and unattenuated grimness of cocoa. Since Jackson was able to provide it with so little delay, I feel I may count on him for blessed renewals. But I shall never count on any one again for Plasmon, which is gruesome and medicinal, or at all events an [...] "acquired taste," [...] which {{the rest of my}} life will not be long enough to acquire.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the country {{produced}} {{an average of}} 1.18 million bags annually, of which all were exported. Washed <b>mild</b> arabica highland <b>coffee</b> dominates the industry in Papua New Guinea (PNG), accounting for 95% of production, the other 5% being lowland washed robusta. The robusta coffee is of poorer quality, being darker, more bitter, with less flavour that the Arabic variety is generally used for cheaper instant coffee. On the other hand, the higher quality arabica coffee is generally sold for making espresso, cappuccino and latte in the European markets of Switzerland, Germany, France and Italy and for American coffee companies such as Starbucks. The {{vast majority of the}} coffee sold to North America is grown in the West and East Highlands on estates; mainly Sigri and Arona coffee respectively.|$|R
6000|$|For {{a day or}} two I {{managed to}} appear at meals; for the human grub must eat till the {{butterfly}} is ready to break loose, and no one had time to come up two flights while it was possible for me to come down. Far be it from me to add another affliction or reproach to that enduring man, the steward; for, compared with his predecessor, he was a horn of plenty; but--I put it to any candid mind--is not the following bill of fare susceptible of improvement, without plunging the nation madly into debt? The three meals were [...] "pretty much of a muchness," [...] and consisted of beef, evidently put down for the men of '76; pork, just in from the street; army bread, composed of saw-dust and saleratus; butter, salt as if churned by Lot's wife; stewed blackberries, so much like preserved cockroaches, that only those devoid of imagination could partake thereof with relish; <b>coffee,</b> <b>mild</b> and muddy; tea, three dried huckleberry leaves to a quart of water--flavored with lime--also animated and unconscious of any approach to clearness. Variety being the spice of life, a small pinch of the article would have been appreciated by the hungry, hard-working sisterhood, one of whom, though accustomed to plain fare, soon found herself reduced to bread and water; having an inborn repugnance to the fat of the land, and the salt of the earth.|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of {{different}} concentrations of coffee on {{peak expiratory flow rate}} (PEFR), blood pressure and pulse rate in an attempt to determine some physiological effects of coffee intake. 18 apparently healthy adult males, age range 20 to 30 years, were recruited for the study over a three day period. Varying concentrations (2 g, 4 g and 6 g) of Nescafe Instant Coffee were administered. 2 g coffee concentration was given on the first day, 4 g on the second day and 6 g on the third. The control measurements were taken {{on the first day of}} the experimental procedure in all subjects. The PEFR readings after coffee administration increased significantly when compared with control readings (P< 0. 05) 4 g and 6 g readings also increased significantly when compared with 2 g readings (P< 0. 05), but there was no significant change between the 4 g and 6 g readings. Using 2 g, no significant change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was observed when compared with controls. SBP increased significantly at 4 g and 6 g when compared with the control (P< 0. 05). Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increased significantly in all categories when compared with the control, but there was no significant change in DBP when the 3 coffee doses were compared. There was significant decrease in PR in all the 3 experimental doses when compared with the control reading (P< 0. 05), 2 g decreased significantly when compared with 4 g, but no significant change when 4 g was compared to 6 g. This study suggests that 2 g of coffee does not give maximum cardio-respiratory effects. The peak effect that coffee can exhibit on PEFR and cardiovascular system was seen from 4 g coffee concentration; but there was no significant difference when compared with 6 g concentration. Only in DBP and PR were significant changes observed when 2 g concentration was administered. It further indicates that, <b>mild</b> doses of <b>coffee</b> confer benefits on airflow in the lungs. While higher doses are also beneficial in improving airflow in the airway, such doses have the disadvantage of increasing BP...|$|R
