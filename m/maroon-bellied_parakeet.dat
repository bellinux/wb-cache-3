5000|$|<b>Maroon-bellied</b> <b>parakeet</b> proper, Pyrrhura frontalis frontalis [...] - [...] Brazil {{from south}} Bahia to Rio Grande do Sul, and west to Mato Grosso do Sul.|$|E
50|$|The green-cheeked parakeet {{is similar}} to the <b>maroon-bellied</b> <b>parakeet</b> (P. frontalis), and {{formerly}} there have been speculations that they were conspecific. It is also similar in appearance to the blaze-winged parakeet and the black-capped parakeet.|$|E
50|$|The <b>maroon-bellied</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Pyrrhura frontalis) {{is a small}} parrot found from southeastern Brazil to {{north-eastern}} Argentina, including eastern Paraguay and Uruguay. It is {{also known}} as the reddish-bellied parakeet, and in aviculture it is usually referred to as the maroon-bellied conure, reddish-bellied conure or brown-eared conure.|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} common and not considered {{threatened by the}} IUCN. Though there is little trade in these parrots, captive-bred birds are occasionally available as pets. <b>Maroon-bellied</b> <b>parakeets</b> can learn to talk, although not clearly. They are among the quietest conures, but their shrill voices still irritate some people.|$|R
50|$|The <b>maroon-bellied</b> <b>parakeet</b> {{is common}} in woodland, and forest edges. In the {{northern}} part of its range, it mainly lives in highlands up to 1,400 m (4,600 ft), but elsewhere it is primarily found in lowlands up to 1,000 m (3,300 ft). Tolerates disturbance well and even lives in urban parks (e.g., Rio de Janeiro and SÃ£o Paulo) and feeds in gardens. Flock size is usually only 6-12 individuals, but up to 40. As other members of the genus Pyrrhura, it primarily feeds on fruits, flowers, and similar plant matter; they rarely participate in mixed-species feeding flock.|$|E
5000|$|The blaze-winged parakeet (Pyrrhura devillei), more {{commonly}} known as the blaze-winged conure in aviculture, is a species of parrot found in wooded habitats in the Pantanal region of Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay. It remains locally fairly common, but has suffered due to extensive habitat destruction within its relatively small range, and has therefore been uplisted to near-threatened by BirdLife International in 2009. The type specimen is labelled Bolivia, but due to shifting borders it is now believed to be from Paraguay. It has often been considered a subspecies of the <b>maroon-bellied</b> <b>parakeet</b> based on apparent hybrids from Paraguay, but - as far as known - the two generally maintain their integrity, and are recent sources are undecided on whether to treat them as one species or two. They resemble each other, but the blaze-winged parakeet has a dusky crown and red [...] "shoulder" [...] and underwing coverts.|$|E
