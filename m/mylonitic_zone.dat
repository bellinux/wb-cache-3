40|$|An {{inversion}} {{method that}} solves for a parameter {{as a continuous}} function (Backus-Gilbert) is {{used to determine the}} lower boundary of a two and one-half dimensional body which causes either a gravity or a magnetic anomaly and then assesses the vertical accuracy (variance) and the lateral resolution (spread). Also the gravity and magnetic data are simultaneously inverted and this procedure improves the resolution of the model over that obtained by inverting either data set individually. The usefulness of the Backus-Gilbert approach is evaluated by a study of the inversion of both synthetic gravity and magnetic data. The convergence characteristics, the amount of data and the distribution of data, the role of incorrect or correct parameters and the integration technique was considered. Gravity and magnetic data from the Sanford Basin, North Carolina are used to illustrate the inversion procedure. The second and third part of this study concerns the interpretation of regional geophysical data to obtain an idea of the crustal structure of the eastern Mojave Desert in California and western Arizona. The analysis of gravity and magnetic data in the Mojave Desert included the construction of Bouguer gravity, magnetic intensity, low and high band pass, and horizontal gradient maps. Based on the 100 - 250 km band pass gravity filtered map, four terranes were described: (1) Colorado River extensional corridor; (2) eastern Mojave gravity low; (3) Granite Mountain fault and (4) Colorado Plateau. Gravity modeling, geologic mapping and seismic refraction data indicate that the eastern Mojave gravity low is caused by a combination of low density Mesozoic intrusive rocks emplaced at depths of 8 - 9 km and a thickening of the crust. The Colorado River extensional corridor is underlain by a high density mid-crustal <b>mylonitic</b> <b>zone</b> based on seismic reflection and refraction data and gravity modeling. Analysis of gravity, magnetic and magnetotelluric data along a profile in western Arizona included the construction of Bouguer gravity and magnetic intensity maps, gravity and magnetotelluric crustal models, and the depth to the Curie isotherm. Low Bouguer gravity values, shallow Curie point depths and low resistivity values in the Castle Dome and Aquarius-Mohon Mountains indicate the potential of geothermal resources. The gravity cross-section also suggests the presence of a mid-crustal <b>mylonitic</b> <b>zone</b> underneath the Buckskin and Rawhide Mountains...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Knowledge of the {{magnitude}} of differential stress and strain rate during the formation of mylonitic shear zones in metamorphic ore complexes provides constraints on the mechanical behavior of the middle continental crust during extension. We analyzed the differential flow stress during the mylonitization of quartzofeldspathic rocks in the Whipple Mountains, California, using grain-size piezometers and kinetic laws for grain growth. Mylonitic gneisses collected from two widely separated transects have grain sizes that cluster in a range from 32 to 61 gm. Analysis of grain growth kinetics indicates that mylonitization of the gneisses continued during cooling to temperatures _< 500 øC, compatible with estimates from two-feldspar thermometry. Quartz grain-size piezometers uggest hat the mylonitization occurred under differential stresses ((• 1 -(• 3) of- 40 - 150 MPa, or maximum shear stresses of 20 - 75 MPa. Extrapolation of quartzite flow laws to 500 øC indicates that the mylonitization occurred at strain rates faster than 10 - 14 s- 1. These stimates suggest that he <b>mylonitic</b> <b>zone</b> within the Whipple Mountains had an effective viscosity of the order of 1018 + 4 - 1020 • [...] 4 Pa s.

The existing geochronological database points to a protracted, but episodic 1. 96 – 1. 88 Ga magmatic history that is broadly coincident with the 2. 1 – 1. 8 Ga Ubendian Orogeny. Molybdenite, pyrite and chalcopyrite samples from mineralized quartz veins and <b>mylonitic</b> shear <b>zones</b> yield Re–Os model ages that range from 1. 95 to 1. 88 Ga, whereas ca. 1. 88 Ga pyrite with gold bearing inclusions and sampled from the host <b>mylonitic</b> shear <b>zone</b> suggest that gold occurred relatively late in this hydrothermal history. The ca. 1. 88 Ga gold event is recorded at all five of the studied prospects, whereas the relationship between gold and the disparately older 1. 95 and 1. 94 Ga Re–Os molybdenite ages is unclear. New U–Pb metamorphic titanite dating of a foliated Archaean granite sample (ca. 2. 76 Ga) suggests that the onset of ductile deformation within the Lupa Goldfield occurred at ca. 1. 92 Ga, and some ca. 40 Myr prior to auriferous and brittle–ductile <b>mylonitic</b> shear <b>zones</b> at ca. 1. 88 Ga. Early ductile deformation is not associated with gold mineralization, but the ductile deformation fabrics and, in particular the development of rheologically weak chloritic folia, may have acted as zones of pre-existing weakness that localized strain and influenced the geometry of later auriferous <b>mylonitic</b> shear <b>zones.</b> The large age difference between U–Pb zircon and titanite ages for the Archaean granite sample {{is in contrast to}} new U–Pb titanite ages for the Saza Granodiorite (1930 ± 3 Ma), which are only slightly outside of analytical uncertainty at the 2 σ level with a previously reported U–Pb zircon age for the same sample (1935 ± 1 Ma). These new age results, together with previously reported U–Pb and Re–Os ages, highlight the protracted magmatic, hydrothermal and structural evolution of the Lupa Goldfield (1. 96 – 1. 88 Ga). They are also consistent with other palaeo-convergent margins where orogenic gold style mineralization occurs relatively late in the orogen's tectono-thermal history...|$|R

In this paper we present results from CT imaging and mineralogical investigations of an Opalinus Clay core on different scales and different regions of interest, emphasizing especially the 3 -D evaluation and distribution of cracks and their impact on mechanical testing of such material. Enhanced knowledge of the testing behaviour of the Opalinus Clay is of great interest, especially since this material is considered for a long-term radioactive waste disposal and storage facility in Switzerland. Hence, results are compared regarding the mineral (i. e. phase) contrast resolution, the spatial resolution, and the overall scanning speed. With this extensive interdisciplinary scale-down approach it has been possible to characterize the general fracture propagation in comparison to mineralogical and textural features of the Opalinus Clay. Additionally, and as far as we know, a so-called <b>mylonitic</b> <b>zone,</b> located at an intersect of two main fractures, has been observed for the first time for an experimentally deformed Opalinus sample. The multi-scale results are in good accordance to data from naturally deformed Opalinus Clay samples, which enables us to perform systematical research under controlled laboratory conditions.

40|$|The Carboniferous Cherbelezu {{batholith}} (Almâj Mountains, Romania) is a well-preserved but poorly studied intrusion {{belonging to}} the Upper Danubian Alpine Nappe. This pluton crops out along a pre-existing major verticalized formation, the Corbu <b>Mylonitic</b> <b>Zone</b> (CMZ). Our study investigates {{the role of the}} CMZ on the deformation recorded during the mush emplacement and cooling. A detailed microstructural study of this granitic body, coupled with investigations on both Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) and Shape Preferred Orientation (SPO) of biotite subfabric, has been performed. The surrounding rocks preserve evidence that the CMZ has been reactivated as a sinistral strike-slip fault before the pluton emplacement. Microstructural investigations of the granitic facies indicate that the pluton has undergone superimposed deformations during its cooling, from submagmatic to LT conditions. Foliation and lineation patterns obtained by AMS and SPO - both methods giving similar results - reflect either magmatic/submagmatic or solid-state flows. Magmatic flow, preserved in the western and southern parts of the pluton, is characterized by concentric foliation pattern with both divergent and parallel lineations, the latter pointing to an early transcurrent regime. Subsequently, a solid-state deformation, recorded during the pluton cooling and restricted to its eastern and northern parts, argues for the concomitant CMZ activity under a sinistral transpressive regime. This is supported by the P' and.

40|$|The Kabye and Kpaza Massifs {{correspond}} to two main granulitic suites in the suture {{zone of the}} Pan-African Da homeyide orogenic belt, in northern Togo. The Kabye Massif is composed of an important west verging nappe pile sub divided into two petrographic units. The nappes in its western petrographic unit {{are made up of}} leucocratic garnet bearing granulites defined as the “Lassa-Soumdina Granulites” (GLS). The eastern petrographic unit consists of mela- nocratic granulites, with metagabbroic structures, called the “Ketao-Sirka Granulites” (GKS). These two petrographic units are separated by the Panalo <b>Mylonitic</b> <b>Zone</b> (ZMP). This major west verging zone includes a syn-Dn + 2 dextral shear contact. The Kpaza Massif comprises nappes of melanocratic granulites (GKM), comparable to the GKS of the Kabye Massif. All these granulitic nappes include boudins of pyroxenites or meta-anorthosites, and ultramafic rocks represented by serpentinites, talcschists, actinolite- and chlorite-schists which generally mark thrust soles. The GLS nappes are thrust over the Kara-Niamtougou orthogneissic unit (UKN) which is considered as the easternmost structural unit of the Dahomeyide external zone. On the other hand, the GKS nappes underlie those of the Binah meta-volcano sedimentary Complex (CB) which belongs to the Dahomeyide internal zone. As regards the Kpaza Massif, it occurs as a geologic window tectonically enclosed in the Mono Complex nappes (CM) corresponding to {{the southern part of the}} CB. The organization of the Kabye and Kpaza Massifs, as west verging nappe piles, and their relationships with the surrounding structural units express the tangential and folding tectonics that structured the Pan-African belt in northern Togo.

40|$|Microstructural {{processes}} in <b>mylonitic</b> shear <b>zones</b> from extrusions of EoceneeOligocene rocksalts from Garmsar hills and Eyvanekey plateau (central Iran) are described and analyzed. The halite samples were studied {{by transmitted light}} microscopy of gamma-irradiated thin sections, subgrain size palaeopiezometry of polished and chemically etched samples and texture measurements by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The studied shear zones are thin (< 5 cm), subhorizontal and bedding parallel. The protomylonite comprises 2 e 6 mm sized grains, occasion-ally rich in primary fluid inclusions indicative of their primary non-recrystallized state. Abundant, well-developed subgrains suggest that the protomylonite was deformed mainly by dislocation processes. Elongated subgrains at grain edges point to recrystallization by fluid-assisted grain boundary migration. Recrystallized, strain-free grains are common. The material in the <b>mylonitic</b> <b>zones</b> is fine grained (w 0. 6 mm) with strong shape-preferred orientation. Microstructures such as oriented fibrous overgrowths and growth banding (observed in gamma-irradiated sections) suggest that the principal deformation mechanism was solution-precipitation creep (non-conservative grain boundary migration and grain bound-ary sliding accommodated by solution-precipitation). Crystal fabrics measured by EBSD show a weak crystallographic preferred orientation {{that is consistent with}} solution-precipitation accommodated grain boundary sliding.

40|$|The South Mountains are {{composed}} of two fundamentally different terranes. The western half of the range consists of Precambrian metamorphic and granitic rocks, whereas the eastern half is dominated by a composite middle Tertiary pluton. North-northwest-trending, middle Tertiary dikes have extensively intruded both terranes. A major episode of middle Proterozoic metamorphism and deformation produced a steep crystalloblastic foliation that generally strikes northeast. Middle Tertiary plutonism was accompanied by intense mylonitization that affected Precambrian and middle Tertiary rocks alike. Discrete phases of mylonitization were associated with each intrusive pulse between 28 and 25 m. y. B. P. Mylonitization generally produced a lowangle foliation and east-northeast-trending lineation. The attitude of mylonitic foliation defines a broad, east-northeast-trending anticline that controls the topographic axis of the range. Structurally low rocks {{in the core of}} the anticline are nonmylonitic, but intensity of mylonitic fabric increases progressively toward higher structural levels. Mylonitic Tertiary plutonic rocks are exposed as a gently dipping carapace overlying their less deformed equivalents. Mylonitic fabric cuts through the Precambrian terrane as a broad, west-dipping zone. Rocks above and below this <b>mylonitic</b> <b>zone</b> are lithologically identical and mostly retain their Precambrian structure. Fabrics in all rock types indicate that mylonitization resulted from extension parallel to east-northeast-trending lineation and flattening perpendicular to subhorizontal foliation. Mylonitization occurred under conditions of elevated temperature but relatively low confining pressure. Gold-bearing quartz veins occur in tension fractures that are late- to post-kinematic with respect to mylonitic deformation. Mylonitization was succeeded by more brittle deformation that produced chloritic breccia and microbreccia in the footwall of a major detachment fault that dips gently to the east. The detachment fault and underlying breccia were formed by normal faulting and brittle extension in an east-northeast direction. Rocks above and immediately below the detachment fault were antithetically rotated during faulting. Mylonitization, detachment faulting, and formation of the main east-northeast-trending anticline are all manifestations of eastnortheast-directed, middle Tertiary extension. Evidence for a possible continuum between mylonitization and detachment faulting has important implications regarding the evolution of Cordilleran metamorphic core complexes...|$|E
40|$|High strain {{rocks in}} the Musgrave Ranges (Central Australia) provide a rather unique insight into the {{development}} of lower crustal shear zones during the 550 Ma Petermann Orogeny, allowing common models for lower crustal deformation to be critically evaluated. The observed structures {{in the study area}} are, from south to north: (1) The Mann Fault, which is poorly exposed but evident on airborne geomagnetic maps. This regional scale fault with a component of dextral shear shows a step-over resulting in the formation of a pull-apart basin. (2) The Davenport Shear Zone, accommodating the horizontal extension in a 7 km wide WNW-ESE-trending <b>mylonitic</b> <b>zone</b> developed under subeclogitic, lower crustal conditions. This high strain zone is bounded to the north by a more than 50 km long, continuous, sheared dolerite dyke. North of this dyke, the ∼ 1200 Ma Musgravian fabric is still preserved, only slightly rotated and typically N-S trending. (3) The Woodroffe Thrust, marking the northern boundary of the Musgrave Ranges, brings these lower crustal rocks on top of amphibolite facies units, with a top-to-north sense of movement. Strain in the Davenport Shear Zone is very heterogeneously distributed, with localization and partitioning from the kilometre down to the millimetre scale. Pseudotachylyte is commonly associated with dykes, especially on the boundaries, and is often sheared. The orientation of sheared dykes and localized shear zones is typically at a high angle to either side of the shortening direction, resulting in a variable sense of shear and a major component of flattening, with a nearly horizontal extension direction. Detailed outcrop-scale mapping shows that compositional inhomogeneities, such as quartz veins, are generally not exploited, even when favourably oriented for shear reactivation. Ultramylonitic shear zones are sometimes only a few millimetres wide but extend for several metres and are generally oblique to the background foliation. Pseudotachylyte often predates or is coeval with localized shearing and fracturing clearly {{played a major role in}} the nucleation of mesoscale discrete shear zones. In order to constrain the conditions of pseudotachylyte formation, and to establish whether they developed under lower crustal subeclogitic conditions, garnet-bearing sheared pseudotachylytes were sampled for geothermobarometric analysis...|$|E

Data included Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images, digital elevation models (DEM), and digital orthophoto quadrangle quads (DOQQ). The main {{findings in this study}} are two nearly orthogonal systems of structures that have never been reported in the Rincon Mountains. The first system, a penetrative faulting system of the footwall rocks, trends N 10 - 30 °W. Similar structures identified in other metamorphic core complexes. The second system trends N 60 - 70 °E, and has only been alluded indirectly in the literature of metamorphic core complexes. The structures pervade mylonites in Tanque Verde Mountain, Mica Mountain, and the Rincon Peak area. As measured on the imagery, spacing between the N 10 - 30 °W lineaments ranges from ∼ 0. 5 to 2 km, and from 0. 25 to 1 km for the N 60 - 70 °E system. Field inspection reveals that the N 10 - 30 °W trending system, are high-angle normal faults dipping mainly to the west. One of the main faults, named here the Cabeza de Vaca fault, has a polished, planar, striated and grooved surface with slickenlines indicating pure normal dip-slip movement (N 10 °W, 83 °SW; slickensides rake 85 °SW). The Cabeza de Vaca fault is the eastern boundary of a 2 km-wide graben, with displacement as great as 400 meters. The N 10 - 30 °W faults are syn- to post-mylonitic, high-angle normal faults that formed during isostatic uplift of the Rincon core complex during mid-Tertiary time. This interpretation is based on previous works, which report similar fault patterns in other metamorphic core complexes. Faults trending N 20 - 30 °W, shape the east flank of Mica Mountain. These faults, on the back dipping <b>mylonitic</b> <b>zone,</b> dip east and may represent late-stage antithetic shear zones. The Cabeza de Vaca fault and the back dipping antithetic faults accommodate as much as 65 % of the extension due to doming of the core complex. The N 60 - 70 °E structures, not verified as a fault system, are a joint system pervading the footwall rocks of the metamorphic core complex. This system is less systematic.

40|$|Gold occurrences in the Lupa goldfield, SW Tanzania, {{are typical}} of the orogenic Au deposit type. Auriferous quartz veins and <b>mylonitic</b> shear <b>zones</b> cross cut Archean granitoids (ca. 2740 Ma) and Paleoproterozoic felsic-mafic {{intrusions}} (1960 – 1880 Ma) comprising a Paleoproterozoic magmatic arc at the Tanzanian cratonic margin. Lu-Hf zircon results provide evidence for ca. 3. 1 Ga basement beneath the Lupa goldfield and imply significant portions of the Ubendian Belt represent re-worked Archean crust. A greenschist facies metamorphic mineral assemblage overprints all of the magmatic phases and U-Pb dating of syn-metamorphic titanite hosted by a foliated Archean granitoid at ca. 1950 Ma suggests the onset of this tectonothermal episode occurred during the Paleoproterozoic. The majority of mineralization is hosted by a network of brittle-ductile and <b>mylonitic</b> shear <b>zones,</b> which record evidence for transpressional deformation of triclinic, or lower order, symmetry. Relacement of igneous feldspar (plagioclase and K feldspar) with intrinsically weaker phyllosilicates, during sericitization of the granitic wall rock, created the ideal conditions for strain localization and locally {{may have led to}} the onset of crystal plastic deformation processes. Continued feedback between fluid, rock and deformation generated interconnected networks of weak <b>mylonitic</b> shear <b>zones</b> that are subject to reactivation. Quartz veins are the other significant host for Au and possess geometries that imply mineralization occurred concurrently with episodic fluid pressure fluctuations. Re-Os molybdenite, pyrite and chalcopyrite geochronology ages record a protracted metallogenic history and provide evidence for at least two mineralizing events at ca. 1940 and 1885 Ma. Each metallogenic event is represented in detail by a hydrothermal history that occurred at a time scale less than the resolution of the Re-Os method. High precision U-Pb zircon ages for the Saza Granodiorite overlap with Re-Os ages and provide unequivocal evidence for magmatism concomitant with sulphidation, however the wide range of Re-Os sulphide ages precludes a genetic relationship between any individual intrusion and Au. The goldfield-wide metallogenic event at ca. 1885 Ma occurred concurrently with eclogite facies metamorphism elsewhere in the Ubendian Belt and provides one of Earth’s earliest examples of subduction processes temporally linked to orogenic Au deposit formation. Mesoproterozoic Re-Os ages (ca. 1125 Ma) correlated to the Kibaran/Irumide Orogenies and compatible with inferred Pb loss events provide evidence for sulphidation during at least two discrete orogenic cycles and suggest mid-crustal <b>mylonitic</b> shear <b>zones</b> represent long-lived zones of structural weakness.

40|$|A crustal-scale {{shear zone}} network at the fossil brittle-to-viscous {{transition}} exposed at Cap de Creus, NE Spain evolved by coeval fracturing and viscous, mylonitic overprinting {{of an existing}} foliation. Initial fracturing led to mylonitic shearing as rock softened in ductilely deformed zones surrounding the fractures. <b>Mylonitic</b> shear <b>zones</b> widened by lateral branching of fractures from these shear zones and by synthetic rotation of the existing foliation between the fractures and shear zones. Shear zones lengthened {{by a combination of}} fracturing and mylonitic shearing in front of the shear zone tips. Shear zones interconnected along and across their shearing planes, separating rhomb-shaped lozenges of less deformed rock. Lozenges were subsequently incorporated into the <b>mylonitic</b> shear <b>zones</b> by widening in the manner described above. In this way, deformation became homogeneous on the scale of initial fracturing (metre- to decametre-scale). In contrast, the shear zone network represents localisation of strain on a decametre-length scale. The strength of the continental crust at the time of coeval fracturing and viscous shearing is inferred to have decreased with time and strain, as fracturing evolved to mylonitic shearing, and as the shear zones coalesced to form a through-going network subparallel to the shearing plane. Crustal strength must therefore be considered as strain- and scale-dependent...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Monte Grighini Complex {{consist of}} a pile of variscan Nappes and of a suite of granitoid rocks, mostly monzogranite and leucogranite (Musumeci, 1992), that intrudes the tectonic unit of Monte Grighini. Rb/Sr and Ar/Ar radiometric data give, for granitoid rocks, an age of about 305 - 300 Ma (Carmignani et al., 1987; Laurenzi et al., 1991). A late variscan shear zone affects the SW side of the complex and {{produces}} a wide cataclastic and <b>mylonitic</b> <b>zone,</b> along which leucogranite can be mostly found. In this zone an outcrop, that shows a rapid change in the intensity of mylonitic deformation, has been investigated in detail. The outcrop is affected by a pervasive N 162 - 170 ° foliation dipping 60 - 65 ° W. Petrographic and XRD analysis show the following mineralogical assemblage: quartz, k-felspar, plagioclase (albite), muscovite, biotite, iron oxides and ± tourmaline ± apatite ± zircon ± epidote. Almost all samples are characterized by k-feldspar porphyroclasts in a quartz-phyllosilicate matrix. On the basis of porphyroclast/matrix ratio protomylonite, mylonite and ultramylonite layers have been identified. In protomylonitic layers k-felspar phenocrysts are fractured and sometimes perthitic. Quartz occurs in microcrystalline lens and bands following the foliation. Phyllosilicate matrix consists of biotite, subordinate muscovite and chlorite. Mylonitic layers {{are similar to the}} previous ones but show a decrease in grain-size. Ultramylonitic layer consists of rare k-feldspar relics in a very fine-grained phyllosilicate matrix. The following physical properties have been determined in 12 series of samples with varying degree of deformation: the open porosity, the total porosity, the real and apparent density, the water imbibition coefficient, and the water saturation index. To calculate the closed and total porosity the real density of ground samples were determined. The ultrasonic velocity of the studied samples has been determined in three directions: 1) perpendicular to the foliation, 2) parallel to the foliation and to the direction of mineral stretching lineation, 3) parallel to the foliation and perpendicular to the direction of mineral stretching lineation. The overall results indicate that the samples of protomylonite, mylonite and ultramylonite have different physical properties values. The average values of the real density of samples vary from a minimum of 2. 66 ± 0. 02 g/cm 3 in the protomylonitic samples, to a maximum of 2. 72 ± 0. 01 g/cm 3, in the ultramylonitic samples.

40|$|Structural field-data {{collected}} in the Taku Schists and surrounding units {{in the state of}} Kelantan, NE Malaysia, indicate a structure of an asymmetric, doubly plunging anticline, with a steeply dipping eastern flank. The contact with the surrounding sediments in the southeast was found to be mylonitic, indicating severe shearing along the contact zone. Stretching lineations developed throughout the Taku Schists, show a dominant plunge direction of 130 E. Kinematic indicators show that the tectonic movement is dominantly top down to southeast. The results are used to construct a comprehensive tectonic evolution of the Taku Schists. The protoliths of the schists are Early to Middle Permian deposits, accumulated on the fore-arc of the Sukhothai volcanic arc. They are affected by regional contractional event, D 1, during the Triassic collision of the Sibumasu Terrane and the Sukhothai Arc. The D 1 -structures are the pervasive foliation fabric S 1 and regional thrust faulting. The D 1 -event is synchronous with the metamorphic event M 1, which is burial metamorphism in amphibolite facies. In Cretaceous times, the Stong Complex intrudes in the crust as a result of decompression melting. Crustal thinning causing decompression is related to slab rollback of the oceanic slab subducted during the Triassic collision. During the Late Cretaceous, subduction of the Australian plate along the Sunda margin ceases {{for a short period of}} time due to continental collision with a micro-continental plate. Resumed subduction causes N-S oriented contraction, folding the S 1 foliation fabric in open folds with E-W oriented axial planar strike (D 2). Eocene dextral transtension moves the East Malaya Block to the southeast, and causes localised exhumation (D 3). The Taku Schists are exhumed as a result of the localised exhumation, along the detachment plane in the southeast. The driving mechanism is most consistent with simple shear models for metamorphic core complexes. This model explains the doubly plunging anticlinal geometry of the foliation fabric S 1, the consistent stretching lineations with top down to southeast kinematics, the <b>mylonitic</b> <b>zone</b> along the southeast border of the Taku Schists, the parallelism between fold hinges throughout the Taku Schists and the stretching lineations, and the similarity between kinematics of young normal faults and of the stretching lineations. The Stong Complex shows localised deformation structures with parallel stretching lineations and shear sense kinematics to those observed in the Taku Schists.

The exhumation mechanism for the Stong Complex is therefore the same as for the Taku Schists: most consistent with the simple shear model for metamorphic core complexes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{have carried}} out a {{comparative}} Rb­Sr, Sm­Nd and Lu­Hf isotopic study of a progressively deformed hercynian leucogranite from the French Massif Central, belonging to the La Marche ductile shear zone, in order to investigate the respective perturbation of these geochronometers with fluid induced deformation. The one-meter wide outcrop presents a strongly deformed and mylonitized zone at the center, and an asymmetric deformation pattern with a higher deformation gradient on the northern side of the zone. Ten samples have been carefully collected every 10 cm North and South away from the strongest deformed <b>mylonitic</b> <b>zone.</b> They have been analyzed for a complete major, trace element data set, oxygen isotopes, Rb­Sr, Sm­Nd and Lu­Hf isotopic systematics. We show that most of major and trace elements except SiO 2, alkaline elements (K 2 O, Rb), and some metal transition elements (Cu), are progressively depleted with increasing deformation. This depletion includes REE + Y, but also HFS elements (Ti, Hf, Zr, Nb) which are commonly considered as immobile elements during upper level processes. Variations in elemental ratios with deformation, e. g. decrease in LREE/MREE- HREE, Nd/Hf, Th/Sr, increase in Rb/Sr, U/Th and constant Sr/Nd, lead to propose the following order of element mobility: U Th > Sr = Nd Hf + HREE. We conclude in agreement with previous tectonic and metallogenic studies that trace element patterns across the shear zone result from circulation of oxidizing F-rich hydrothermal fluids associated with deformation. A temperature of the fluid of 470 ­ 480 C can be deduced from the d 18 O equilibrium between quartz­muscovite pairs. Elemental fractionation induces perturbation of the Rb­Sr geochronometer. The well-defined 87 Rb/ 86 Sr­ 87 Sr/ 86 Sr correlation gives an apparent age of 294 ± 19 Ma, slightly younger than the 323 ± 4 Ma age of leucogranites in this area. This apparent age is interpreted as dating event of intense deformation and fluid circulation associated with mass transfer, and exhumation of the ductile crust shortly after the leucogranite emplacement. Sm­Nd and Lu­Hf isochron-type diagrams do not define any correlation, because of the low fractionated Sm/Nd and Lu/Hf ratios. Isotopic data demonstrate that only the Lu­Hf geochronometer system is not affected by fluid circulation and gives reliable TDM age (1. 29 ± 0. 03 Ga) and eHf signatures. By contrast, the Sm­Nd geochronometer system gives erroneous old TDM ages of 2. 84 ­ 4 Ga. There is no positive eNd­eHf correlation, because of decreasing eNd values with deformation at constant eHf values. However, eNd­eHf values remain in the broad eNd­eHf terrestrial array, which strongly indicates that fluid-induced fractionation {{can contribute to the}} width of the terrestrial array. The strong eHf negative values of the leucogranite are similar to metasedimentary granulitic xenoliths from the French Massif Central and confirm the generation of the leucogranite by several episodes of reworking of the lower crust...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGiant quartz veins {{associated}} with the South Armorican Shear Zone (SASZ) record huge fluid circulation during the Hercynian period. A regional-scale mapping of veins allows identifying two groups of veins {{on the basis of}} their geometric relationship with the SASZ (fig. 1). Veins from the fist group are parallel to the SASZ and {{associated with}} zones of intense deformation, veins from the second group developed on the southern edge of the SASZ, in an oblique meridian direction. The former likely record infiltration of fluids along permeable pathways; the latter may represent crustal-scale tension gashes associated with East-West ó 3 direction in the regional context (North-South shortening and dextral working of the SASZ along a N 120 direction). Microthermometry on fluid inclusions indicate that fluids were mostly aqueous with very low-salinity. Together with very low ä 18 O values of hydrothermal quertz, down to - 2., these features argue for a surface origin. Scarce but significant CO 2 fluid inclusions indicate a metamorphic contribution for some fluids, the origin of which probably lying in the exhumed metamorphic HT basement in the southern part of the region. Veins represent SiO 2 sinks and we propose through a geochemical characterisation of deformed granites that <b>mylonitic</b> <b>zones</b> developed after syntectonic granites may represent SiO 2 sources...|$|R
40|$|Exhumed faults hosting {{hydrothermal}} systems provide direct {{insight into}} relationships between faulting and fluid flow, {{which in turn}} are valuable for making hydrogeological predictions in blind settings. The Grimsel Breccia Fault (Aar massif, Central Swiss Alps) is a late Neogene, exhumed dextral strike-slip fault with a maximum displacement of 25 – 45 m, and is associated with both fossil and active hydrothermal circulation. We mapped the fault system and modelled it in three dimensions, using the distinctive hydrothermal mineralisation as well as active thermal fluid discharge (the highest elevation documented in the Alps) to reveal the structural controls on fluid pathway extent and morphology. With progressive uplift and cooling, brittle deformation inherited the <b>mylonitic</b> shear <b>zone</b> network at Grimsel Pass; preconditioning fault geometry into segmented brittle reactivations of ductile shear zones and brittle inter-shear zone linkages. We describe ‘pipe’-like, vertically oriented fluid pathways: (1) within brittle fault linkage zones and (2) through alongstrike- restricted segments of formerly ductile shear zones reactivated by brittle deformation. In both cases, low-permeability <b>mylonitic</b> shear <b>zones</b> that escaped brittle reactivation provide important hydraulic seals. These observations show that fluid flow along brittle fault planes is not planar, but rather highly channelised into sub-vertical flow domains, with important implications for the exploration and exploitation of geothermal energy...|$|R

The geophysical profile was situated on the eastern foothill of the Chandman Khayrkhan Uul (SW Mongolia) near the branching of the Chandman rupture, recently seismically active western part of the Bogd fault zone. Geophysical measurements confirmed several sub-parallel faults that are steeply dipping to the south. An imbricated structure inside the fault zone and anastomosing trends of <b>mylonitic</b> <b>zones</b> were revealed by the orientation of the low resistivity zones. The most distinct anomalies indicating the fault zone were localised in mylonitized graphitic limestones, which were preferentially involved in the structure of the fault. The orientations of geophysical anomalies together with geological and structural data from the surface indicate steep thrusting of the southern block over the northern one, accompanying the dominating strike-slip component of the movement along the Chandman rupture. Geometry of faults delimiting the Chandman Khayrkhan Uul, strong asymmetrical morphology of mountain and relics of the Quaternary gravels in its upper part indicate rapid uplift of the range during the Cenozoic in the restraining bend...|$|R

Basement rock exposed in the 250 km 2 study area consists of Precambrian large K-spar granitoid gneiss which is intruded by two Late Cretaceous peraluminous quartz monzonite plutons (Teutonia and Homer Mountain plutons). These plutons are similiar to the Mid Hills adamellite of the Teutonia batholithic complex of the New York Mountains. Developed within the eastern portion of the Precambrian basement, prior to the late Mesozoic plutonism, are a small number of thin, north-trending, east-dipping <b>mylonitic</b> <b>zones.</b> An early Tertiary or older system of generally northtrending altered tholeiitic quartz gabbro dikes are exposed in the central portion of the study area and intrude these basement rocks. Northwest- to northeasttrending conjugate leucocratic aplite dikes are interpreted to have been intruded along with scattered mineralized quartz veins during the final stage of Late Cretaceous plutonism. Late Cretaceous to early Tertiary (?) submarginally economic molybdenium-copper-tungsten mineralization in the western portion of the study area accompanied emplacement of the quartz veins along a northwest-trending shear zone and east-west-trending joints. Younger middle Tertiary age hydrothermal mineralization appears to have accompanied the intrusion of numerous east-west-trending felsic dikes. A similar pattern of mineralization associated with east-west-trending diking is developed in the New York Mountains and further west in the Cima Dome and Granite Spring area. During latest Oligocene time calc-alkaline basalt to quartz andesite flows were extruded onto the western portion of the study area and today cap the highest hills. These flows are associated with the volcanics of the southern Piute Range. A sample of the andesitic flows has yielded a K-Ar age of 27. 7 ?? 1. 4 m. y. B. P. As these andesitic flows were being extruded, the Homer Mountain conglomerate, a cobble- to boulder-sized monolithic conglomerate with minor sandstone and volcanic interbeds, was being deposited in the eastern portion of the study area within a probable steep-walled graben. This conglomerate is intruded by alkalic rhyolitic breccia plugs which have yielded a latest Oligocene K-Ar age of 26. 0 ?? 1. 7 m. y. B. P. The graben into which the Homer Mountain conglomerate was deposited was probably formed during the earliest phase of low-angle detachment faulting which was prevalent during the middle Tertiary in the present day lower Colorado River region. Also in the eastern portion of the study area, northtrending granophyric rhyodacite porphyry dikes and/or sills were intruded into the Precambrian and Mesozoic basement subparallel to the pre-Teutonia <b>mylonitic</b> <b>zones.</b> A sample of this granophyric dike has yielded a latest Oligocene K-Ar age of 27. 2 ?? 2. 7 m. y.

(eds) Tectonics of Western Himalaya & KarakoramInternational audienceDuctile strain {{localisation}} commonly forms {{a pattern}} of shear zones anastomosing around lenses of less deformed rock. Initiation and development history of anastomosing shear zones, which are little documented, are studied through {{the description of the}} structures and the deformation history of plutonic rocks that form the lower crust of the Kohistan Complex. Structures and textures developed in these rocks result from primary magmatic to solid state regional strain overprinted by anastomosing shear zones. The primary strain was mainly acquired during magmatic emplacement at 100 - 90 Ma. Strain localisation took place continuously from magmatic emplacement to solid state deformation during cooling of the plutons and formed 3 successive sets of shear zones. Set 1 is composed of associated discrete Riedel and thrust shear zones developed above solidus conditions during SW-ward thrusting. Continuous deformation from solidus to amphibolite facies conditions between 100 and 83 Ma formed the second set of shear zones. The lower amphibolite facies set 3 shear zones are differentiated by larger strain recorded in the thicker <b>mylonitic</b> <b>zones</b> and enlargement of the spacing between shear zones during cooling.

40|$|Upper lithospheric {{structure}} of the Cordilleran Basin Range (B-R) is characterised by an E-W symmetry of velocity layering. The crust is 25 km thick on its eastern active margin, thickening to 30 km within the central portion and thinning to approx. 25 km on the west. Pn velocities of 7. 8 to 7. 9 km/s characterize the upper mantle low velocity cushion, 7. 4 km/s to 7. 5 km/s, occurs {{at a depth of}} approx. 25 km in the eastern B-R and underlies the area of active extension. An upper-crustal low-velocity zone in the eastern B-R shows a marked P-wave velocity inversion of 7 % at depths of 7 to 10 km also in the area of greatest extension. The seismic velocity models for this region of intraplate extension suggest major differences from that of a normal, thermally underformed continental lithosphere. Interpretations of seismic reflection data demonstrate the presence of extensive low-angle reflections in the upper-crust of the eastern B-R at depths from near-surface to 7 to 10 km. These reflections have been interpreted to represent low-angle normal fault detachments or reactivated thrusts. Seismic profiles across steeply-dipping normal faults in unconsolidated sediments show reflections from both planar to downward flatening (listric) faults that in most cases do not penetrate the low-angle detachments. These faults are interpreted as late Cenozoic and cataclastic <b>mylonitic</b> <b>zones</b> of shear displacement...|$|R
30|$|The Lochseiten calc-mylonite was {{interpreted}} by Schmid (1975) as resulting from superplastic deformation. However, more recently Badertscher and Burkhard (2000) documented field, petrographic, and isotopic evidence for multiple episodes of cataclasis and hydrofracturing leading to vein formation (indicative of the tensile overpressure state), overprinted by ductile crystal plastic smearing of cataclasites and veins. Most of the calcite in the Lochseitenkalk tectonite thus likely originated as vein calcite. The isotopic {{evidence suggests that}} large fluid volumes were channelled along the <b>mylonitic</b> shear <b>zones</b> with periodic build-up of fluid overpressure to near-lithostatic values inducing cataclastic deformation, hydrofracturing and vein formation, followed by renewed crystal plastic deformation once discharge and drops in fluid pressure had occurred.|$|R

40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. On the north {{west coast of}} Kangaroo Island {{in the vicinity of}} Snug Cove a major shear - the Snug Cove Shear Zone (SCSZ) has been recognised. The Snug Cove Shear Zone trends east-west in the area but is believed to strike inland to the east. The lithologies in the area were highly foliated and recrystallised in the shear zone but are gently folded outside of it. The lithological descriptions of Daily & Milnes (1971, 1973) were used to determine the stratigraphic position of the Snug Cove rocks; they {{are most likely to be}} within the Tapanappa Formation. Flattening strains in the area were low and the strain ellipsoid was oblate to spherical - a result of high recrystallisation. Kinematic indicators indicate a top to the north sense of shear throughout the shear zone. Strain variations in the shear zone are illustrated by the presence of high strain <b>mylonitic</b> <b>zones</b> in between lenticular relatively less deformed zones and the anastomosing nature of the mylonitic foliation. The relationship between the SCSZ and the nearby West Bay Syncline is due to the reactivation of a preexisting fault such that the SCSZ is located on the normal limb of the fold and not on the overturned limb as expected. The localisation of stress to create a ductile to semi-ductile shear zone is attributed to the buttressing effect of the Gawler Craton. Regionally, more than one deformation can be proposed on the basis of foliation relationships in porphyroblast schist.

40|$|A {{detailed}} Re-Os molybdenite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite geochronology at five shear-hosted Au occurrences (Kenge, Mbenge, Porcupine, Konokono, and Dubwana) in the Lupa goldfield, southwestern Tanzania, {{is reported}} in this paper. Au occurrences within the Lupa goldfield share many geologic similarities with the orogenic Au deposit type and are situated within a Paleoproterozoic magmatic arc that intruded the Archean Tanzanian cratonic margin. Pyrite ± chalcopyrite ± molybdenite-bearing fault-fill veins and <b>mylonitic</b> shear <b>zones</b> crosscut granitic host rocks and {{are associated with the}} highest Au grades. Re-Os sulfide ages are deemed a suitable proxy to constrain the timing of Au based on the occurrence of Au-bearing minerals as inclusions within pyrite and chalcopyrite, whereas Au-bearing minerals filling pyrite fractures may represent a younger and undated metallogenic event. Molybdenite at Kenge occurs as ultrafine disseminations within fault-fill veins (1953 ± 6 Ma; n = 3) that possess nominally older weighted average Re-Os ages than molybdenite hosted by stylolite-like veins (1937 ± 8 Ma; n = 7). Both sample sets are ca. 70 m. y. older than a weighted average Re-Os pyrite age from the <b>mylonitic</b> shear <b>zones</b> at Kenge and Mbenge (1876 ± 10 Ma; n = 13), which contain fault-fill veins and record the timing of mylonitization. Molybdenite at Porcupine occurs as ultrafine disseminations within quartz veins and mylonitized granite samples (1886 ± 6 Ma; n = 4) that are broadly equivalent in age to weighted average Re-Os ages of molybdenite occurring as stylolite-like veins (1873 ± 5 Ma; n = 6) and pyrite within oblique-extension veins (1894 ± 45 Ma; n = 2). Weighted average Re-Os pyrite model ages at Konokono (1880 ± 14 Ma; n = 9) and Dubwana (1905 ± 25 Ma; n = 2) are also consistent with the ca. 1. 88 Ga event observed at Kenge, Mbenge, and Porcupine. Gold occurrences in the Lupa goldfield therefore record a protracted hydrothermal history (1. 95 – 1. 87 Ga) comprising at least three temporally distinct hydrothermal events (ca. 1. 95, 1. 94, and 1. 88 Ga), which are each represented in detail by a complex vein history that occurred at a time scale less than the resolution of the Re-Os method. The sampling of broadly contemporaneous sulfides from five shear <b>zones</b> suggest that <b>mylonitic</b> shear <b>zones</b> represented an interconnected network of midcrustal permeable fluid conduits at ca. 1. 88 Ga that permitted the transportation and deposition of gold. Comparison between Re-Os sulfide and high-precision U-Pb zircon ages for the granitic host rocks provides unequivocal evidence for sulfidation concomitant with magmatism. However, the range of Re-Os ages argues against an intrusion-related deposit model whereby metallogenic fluids are solely derived from an individual intrusion. The regional ca. 1. 88 Ga metallogenic event identified as part of this study occurred concurrently with eclogite facies metamorphism during the Ubendian orogenic cycle and provides one of Earth’s earliest temporal links between subduction zone processes and orogenic Au deposit formation during the Paleoproterozoic...|$|R
40|$|Metamorphic core {{complexes}} (MCC) are formations of deep basement {{metamorphic rocks}} (lower plate) exhumed through {{an upper plate}} of younger sedimentary and igneous supracrustal deposits. Though the mechanism for MCC formation is poorly understood, they are thought to occur in regions of broad lithospheric extension and may represent several different stages of orogenic stresses. These paleostresses, both regional and local, can be recorded by twinning of syntectonic calcite. Prior to this study, the calcite strain-gage technique has never been applied to MCCs. The Liaonan metamorphic core complex (LMCC), located on {{the southern end of}} the Liaodong Peninsula in Liaoning Province, Northeast China, is part of a suite of similar MCC structures across the North China tectonic block. It is a Cretaceous-aged Cordilleran-style complex, characterized by a WNW-dipping master detachment fault on its western side, a <b>mylonitic</b> detachment <b>zone</b> within an Archean lower plate, Cretaceous synextensional granodioritic intrusions throughout the structure, and an upper plate of Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, capped by a Cretaceous supradetachment basin. Foliation orientations and kinematic indicators within the <b>mylonitic</b> shear <b>zone</b> suggest WNW-ESE extension with some local variation. Twinned calcite grains in synextensional veins and fault gouge (n = 575) of the LMCC preserve subhorizontal MCC-axis-parallel-shortening (with some variability to local detachment fault orientation) and vertical extension. Strain magnitudes tend to be greater in the detachment samples and smaller in the upper plate and syntectonic supradetachment basin samples. A lack of strain overprint is represented by small amounts of negative expected values in the dataset (NEVs). The differential stress responsible for twinning is about - 375 bars throughout the entire sample suite indicating shallow calcite deformation. Vertical extension preserved in our twin results suggests MCC emplacement was strongly influenced by diapiric magmatism. This is likely characteristic of rapid late-stage MCC exhumation, where relative regional extension is still perpendicular to a NNE-SSW shortening direction but a strong buoyancy component recorded by extensional strain ultimately drives the lower plate to its final position at the surface...|$|R
