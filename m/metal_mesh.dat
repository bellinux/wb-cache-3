5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} {{diffusers}} and pumps paled into insignificance besides {{those with the}} porous barrier. In order to work, the gaseous diffusion process required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to plugging. It had to be extremely porous, but strong enough to handle the high pressures. And, like everything else, it had to resist corrosion from uranium hexafluoride. The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the Bell Telephone Laboratories experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the City College of New York worked on a design with electroplated metallic nickel. Norris was an English interior decorator, who had developed a very fine <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> for use with a spray gun. Their design appeared too brittle and fragile for the proposed use, particularly on the higher stages of enrichment, but there was hope {{that this could be}} overcome.|$|E

25|$|GTN transdermal patches {{should be}} removed before {{defibrillation}} due {{to the risk of}} explosion and/or burns, but investigations have concluded that GTN patch explosions during defibrillation were due to voltage breakdown involving the <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> in some patches.|$|E
40|$|International audienceExperimental {{data for}} {{inductive}} cross shaped <b>metal</b> <b>meshes</b> with periodicity constant g= 20 [*]μm have been reproduced by the Micro-Stripes simulation program for various thicknesses. A similar calculation has been {{performed with the}} Fourier modal method for cross shaped meshes with periodicity constant g= 1 [*]μm. The transmittances of all these meshes show similar resonance peaks and the same dependence on thickness. A rudimentary coupled oscillator model describes very well the dependence on thickness of the peaks, suggesting that the transmittance of all <b>metal</b> <b>meshes</b> in the short and long wavelength region are excited surface waves coupled by waveguide modes of the openings...|$|R

25|$|In a Stirling engine, the {{regenerator}} is {{an internal}} heat exchanger and temporary heat store placed between the {{hot and cold}} spaces such that the working fluid passes through it first in one direction then the other, taking heat from the fluid in one direction, and returning it in the other. It {{can be as simple}} as <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> or foam, and benefits from high surface area, high heat capacity, low conductivity and low flow friction. Its function is to retain within the system that heat that would otherwise be exchanged with the environment at temperatures intermediate to the maximum and minimum cycle temperatures, thus enabling the thermal efficiency of the cycle (though not of any practical engine) to approach the limiting Carnot efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Since then, the {{telescope}} has been upgraded several times. Initially, when the maximum expected operating frequency was about 500MHz, the surface consisted of half-inch galvanized wire mesh laid {{directly on the}} support cables. In 1974, a high-precision surface consisting of 40,000 individually adjustable aluminum panels replaced the old wire mesh, and the highest usable frequency rose to about 5000MHz. A Gregorian reflector system was installed in 1997, incorporating secondary and tertiary reflectors to focus radio waves at one point. This allowed installing a suite of receivers, covering the full 1–10GHz range, that could be easily moved to the focal point, giving Arecibo more flexibility. A <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> screen was also installed around the perimeter to block the ground's thermal radiation from reaching the feed antennas. Finally, a more powerful 2400MHz transmitter was added.|$|E
25|$|These usually {{consist of}} netting made of {{synthetic}} fibers or fine <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> that is fitted to the ventilation slats / windows of housing for livestock animals. The fiber netting can be impregnated with insecticides {{such as the}} synthetic pyrethroid deltamethrin that acts rapidly when flies such as Stomoxys or Glossina species land on it. Valuable horses in areas infested with Culicoides midges or Simulium black-flies can be protected with commercially available shields made of cloth that fit over head, neck and back. Flies such as the Musca, Stomoxys and Haematobia species have larval habitats amongst livestock dung and soiled bedding found around livestock farms. There is scope for reducing fly infestation by clearing these wastes to composting containers or areas. However, for many types of dipteran fly the larvae inhabit areas such as bogs (Culicoides), swamps (mosquitoes), or rivers (Simulium) that are impractical to treat under typical commercial constraints within agriculture.|$|E
40|$|We studied surface plasmon sensors {{based on}} {{micrometric}} <b>metal</b> <b>meshes</b> by optical transmission spectroscopy {{as a function}} of the angle of incidence. The mesh period was set to 2 mu m for operation at mid-infrared wavelengths. <b>Metal</b> <b>meshes</b> on dielectric substrates were compared to suspended meshes obtained with a lift-off-free fabrication process, which reduces plasmon damping and increases the quality factor up to 25. We have numerically calculated the electric field distribution of "dark" quadrupole-like modes and found that the suspended mesh provides an enhanced interaction volume extending up to hundreds of nanometers in free space. Our sensors have been experimentally tested and they exhibited a sensitivity up to 1. 4 center dot 10 (- 3) nm(- 1), at least 1 order of magnitude better than standard mid-infrared absorption spectroscopy...|$|R

A simple model for the dependence of the Wood anomaly on the refractive index is presented...|$|R
25|$|As the {{combustion}} flue gas exits the boiler it is routed through a rotating flat basket of <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> which picks up heat and returns it to incoming fresh air as the basket rotates. This {{is called the}} air preheater. The gas exiting the boiler is laden with fly ash, which are tiny spherical ash particles. The flue gas contains nitrogen along with combustion products carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. The fly ash is removed by fabric bag filters or electrostatic precipitators. Once removed, the fly ash byproduct can sometimes {{be used in the}} manufacturing of concrete. This cleaning up of flue gases, however, only occurs in plants that are fitted with the appropriate technology. Still, the majority of coal-fired power stations in the world do not have these facilities. Legislation in Europe has been efficient to reduce flue gas pollution. Japan has been using flue gas cleaning technology for over 30 years and the US has been doing the same for over 25 years. China is now beginning to grapple with the pollution caused by coal-fired power stations.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "How Will I Know", {{directed}} by Brian Grant and choreographed by Arlene Phillips, was filmed {{prior to the}} release of the single and album. Unlike her previous music videos, Houston was given the opportunity to move beyond the staged performance settings to demonstrate elementary dance moves. The video is set against a strikingly designed, vividly colored setting of video screens and partitions. Houston's hair is dyed a honey color, and is held up by a dazzling colored bow. She is also seen accented by a tight, sleeveless gray dress made of <b>metal</b> <b>mesh,</b> reaching almost to her knees, accessorized with matching arm-bracelets. Houston is also seen interacting with animated dancers, in black outfits and wearing French-style makeup. The video also has a scene of splattering of paint and it's dripping down the screen. Houston's label-mate and family friend Aretha Franklin also makes a cameo appearance in the music video. In 2011, Kyle Anderson of MTV wrote that the video was [...] "eye-opening to watch her cut loose in a fun environment," [...] since her previous songs were ballads.|$|E

500|$|A [...] "third-generation" [...] fence, {{much more}} solidly constructed, was {{installed}} in an ongoing programme of improvements from the late 1960s to the 1980s. The fence line was moved back to create an outer strip between the fence and the actual border. The barbed-wire fences were replaced with a barrier that was usually 3.2–4.0 metres (10–13ft) high. It was constructed with expanded <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> (Metallgitterzaun) panels. The openings in the mesh were generally too small to provide finger-holds and were very sharp. The panels could not easily be pulled down, as they overlapped, and {{they could not be}} cut through with a bolt- or wire-cutter. Nor could they be tunnelled under easily, as the bottom segment of the fences was partially buried in the ground. In a number of places, more lightly constructed fences (Lichtsperren) consisting of mesh and barbed wire lined the border. The fences were not continuous and could be crossed at a number of places. Gates were installed to enable guards to patrol up to the line and to give engineers access for maintenance on the outward-facing side of the barrier.|$|E
500|$|Madonna also enlisted male models Brad Alphonso, Jon Kortajarena, Rob Evans, Sean O'Pry and Simon Nessman. In the video, Madonna {{sported a}} {{brassiere}} designed by Agent Provocateur. The singer's stilettos, which were custom-made by footwear designer Paola Bay, consisted of black silk embroidered with silver threading. [...] "She wanted them {{as high as}} possible {{and to be able}} to dance with them on," [...] stated Bay. [...] "We did three fittings to make sure they were like second skin." [...] Arianne Phillips, dress designer for the video, recalled that she had to create custom-made high-heeled stilettos for Kazaky, because of unavailability of shoes in their size. Artur Gaspar from the band recalled that [...] "By the end of the day on set, our feet were bleeding and we had blisters... But if Madonna can repeat the dancing for the 50th time, why can't we?" [...] Phillips explained that they had created three different looks for Madonna in the video. The first was called a [...] "super vixen" [...] look for which she created short tops that could be worn as brassiere. Hairstylist Andy Lecompte wanted to go for a 1960s style with it. The second look portrayed was called [...] "rockstar" [...] for which designer Michael Smith created T-shirts out of <b>metal</b> <b>mesh,</b> while Lecompte cut the singer's hair short, so that it would resemble her early look.

40|$|Experimental {{studies on}} the newly {{proposed}} design of plate-reinforced composite (PRC) coupling beams have been carried out. Previous results have demonstrated the useful application of this design in coupling beams of medium span-to-depth ratios (l/h) under both inelastic seismic and elastic wind loading. This paper presents further experimental studies on five PRC coupling beams, which investigated the importance of shear connectors on plate/reinforced concrete composite action. Three medium-length (l/h= 2. 5) and two short (l/h= 1. 17) PRC coupling beams, each containing a vertically embedded steel plate, were tested under reversed cyclic loading. While one short beam was welded with expanded <b>metal</b> <b>meshes</b> on the plate surfaces, others were welded with shear studs on the plates in the wall regions and/or the beam spans. Results showed that the expanded <b>metal</b> <b>meshes</b> did not work effectively, and while the shear studs in the beam span only slightly increased the beam capacity, those in the wall regions contributed considerably in improving inelastic beam performance. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
