5|$|At 9a.m. on 11 November, Whitlam, {{together}} with {{deputy prime minister}} Frank Crean and Leader of the House Fred Daly, met with the Liberal and Country party leaders. No compromise could be reached. Whitlam informed the Coalition leaders {{that he would be}} advising Kerr to hold a half-Senate election on 13December, and he would not be seeking interim supply for the period before the election. Thinking it unlikely that Kerr would grant the election without supply, Fraser warned Whitlam that the Governor-General might <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> own mind about the matter. Whitlam was dismissive and after the meeting broke, telephoned Kerr to tell him that he needed an appointment to advise him to hold a half-Senate election. Both men were busy in the morning, Kerr with Remembrance Day commemorations, and Whitlam with a caucus meeting and a censure motion in the House which the Opposition had submitted. The two discussed a meeting for 1:00p.m., though Kerr's office later called Whitlam's and confirmed the time as 12:45. Word of this change did not reach the Prime Minister. Whitlam announced the request for a half-Senate election to his caucus, which approved it.|$|E
5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E

25|$|The Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges was {{an admirer}} of Orlando and {{included}} a poem, Ariosto y los árabes (Ariosto and the Arabs), exploring {{the relationship between the}} epic and the Arabian Nights, in his 1960 collection, El hacedor.

25|$|After Rachmaninoff's death, poet Marietta Shaginyan {{published}} fifteen letters {{they exchanged}} {{from their first}} contact in February 1912 and their final meeting in July 1917. The nature of their relationship bordered on romantic, but was primarily intellectual and emotional. Shaginyan and the poetry she shared with Rachmaninoff has been cited as {{the inspiration for the}} six songs that <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> Six Songs, Op. 38.|$|E

25|$|However, {{reminiscent}} of Maas's junior season in Oregon with Akili Smith, Higgins seemed unable to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> mind. In {{a game against}} the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Ray struggled and Maas came in, successfully engineering an Eskimos comeback. Ray started the next game but in the game after, the second-to-last game of the season, Maas again appeared in relief and was again solid. Finally, in the last game of the year, Maas got the start and played well.|$|E
25|$|At Cheltenham College, {{where he}} was educated, they tell of a smart bit of fielding which he did when the M.C.C. played the College Eleven one year. He was bowling to George Hearne, who stepped back and pulled him twice between the wicket and mid-on. The third ball was bowled in the same place, and Hearne pulled it again; but Mr. Strachan moved a yard or two when he saw him <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> mind to hit in the same way, and brought off a {{remarkable}} catch yards from the wicket.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, Johnson {{traveled}} to Dallas, Texas, for another recording session with Don Law {{in a makeshift}} studio at the Vitagraph (Warner Brothers) Building, at 508 Park Avenue, where Brunswick Record Corporation was located on the third floor. Eleven records from this session would be released within the following year. Johnson did two takes of most of these songs, and recordings of those takes survived. Because of this, there is more opportunity to compare different performances of a single song by Johnson than for any other blues performer of his time and place. Johnson recorded {{almost half of the}} 29 songs that <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> entire discography in Dallas.|$|E

25|$|At some point, Colonel James Fannin {{became the}} {{commander}} of the troops at La Bahia. He renamed the presidio Fort Defiance. In February 1836, President Antonio López de Santa Anna led a large force of Mexican Army troops into Texas to quell the revolution. Santa Anna and part of his force entered Bexar on February 23 and initiated a siege of the Alamo. Alamo commander William B. Travis immediately sent a courier to Fannin, asking him to provide reinforcements to the Alamo. At first unable to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> mind, Fannin finally decided to ride to the relief of the Alamo. Historian Robert Scott suggests that the trip was initiated after Fannin's objections were overridden by his officers.|$|E
25|$|Rameau {{was taught}} music {{before he could}} read or write. He was educated at the Jesuit college at Godrans, {{but he was not}} a good pupil and {{disrupted}} classes with his singing, later claiming that his passion for opera had begun at the age of twelve. Initially intended for the law, Rameau decided {{he wanted to be a}} musician, and his father sent him to Italy, where he stayed for a short while in Milan. On his return, he worked as a violinist in travelling companies and then as an organist in provincial cathedrals before moving to Paris for the first time. Here, in 1706, he published his earliest known compositions: the harpsichord works that <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> first book of Pièces de clavecin, which show the influence of his friend Louis Marchand.|$|E
25|$|Odom {{transferred}} to the University of Rhode Island but was forced to sit out the 1997–98 season. He was admitted as a non-matriculating student, and {{was not allowed to}} play intramural basketball. His room and board was paid for by his father, who was covered by the G.I. Bill. After two semesters and a summer session, Odom earned his eligibility to play basketball. His career at Rhode Island had been in jeopardy after the first semester, when he vanished before finals. However, Rhode Island coach Jim Harrick persuaded three of his four instructors to allow him to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> work. The coach also had Odom work with DeGregorio, who had become a Rams assistant and was the player's closest friend in college. Odom was also inspired by his maternal grandmother, a nurse who had raised five children and returned to school to earn her degree in 1980 at age 56.|$|E

25|$|Having lost {{eight seconds}} to Contador {{in the first}} day's {{individual}} time trial, Froome ceded even more time {{to him on the}} third stage, when the Spaniard broke away from the peloton during the uphill finish to win the stage. Now 27 seconds behind Contador, with only one mountain stage remaining, Froome seemed likely to end up second. But on the penultimate fourth stage, which had a steep uphill finish, Team Sky worked hard and dropped all of Contador's Tinkoff-Saxo teammates as the leaders reached the final climb. After some punchy moves by his support riders, Froome began a solo attack. For a short time Contador was able to follow, but he soon fell away. Froome won the stage and was able to open a 29-second gap on second-place Contador by the finish line, enough to overcome his deficit and take the overall race lead by two seconds. The final fifth stage was relatively flat, with no likely chance for Contador to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> deficit, allowing Froome to collect his first stage race victory since May 2014. This was the third year in a row that Froome won his season opener stage race.|$|E
25|$|In September 1990 Chrétien {{seeing a}} chance to make a strong {{impression}} on public opinion after a shaky start as a leader reaped a major windfall after Mulroney introduced an unpopular Goods and Services Tax (GST), which Chrétien decided to vigorously oppose. Traditionally in Canada the government had levied a 13.5% Manufacturer's Sales Tax (MST), which was paid by manufacturers, who passed on the cost of the tax to consumers in the form of higher prices. Since foreign manufacturers did not pay the MST, this placed Canadian companies at a competitive disadvantage in their home market, and to compensate the government had levied tariffs on manufactured imports to maintain a level playing field. When the free trade agreement with the United States came into effect in 1989, the government could no longer levy tariffs on American imports, which led to furious complaints from Canadian industry about having to compete with American companies who did not pay the MST. To save Canadian industry and the jobs of those Canadians employed in manufacturing from being destroyed by American competition, the Mulroney government decided in late 1989 to abolish the MST and replace it with the 7% GST, whose costs would be borne by consumers. On the proposed GST, Chrétien was torn between his belief that the GST was economically necessary vs. his desire to score political points by opposing a proposed tax that most Canadians hated, and as such, he was initially vague about where he stood about the GST. It was only in September 1990 after months of vacillation did Chrétien finally <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> mind to oppose the GST.|$|E

500|$|As Berlin {{could not}} read or write music, and could only pick out tunes on a {{specially}} designed piano that transposed keys automatically, he required an assistant to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> piano parts.

[...] These parts were subsequently orchestrated by a team comprising Edward Powell, Maurice de Packh, Gene Rose, Eddie Sharp, and Arthur Knowlton who worked under the overall supervision of Max Steiner.|$|E
500|$|The latest {{technological}} innovation of the time, submarines, {{were developed in}} the state of New Jersey by an Irish-American inventor, John Philip Holland. His submarine, [...] was officially commissioned into U.S. Navy service in the fall of 1900. The Russo-Japanese War of 1905 and the launching of [...] in the following year lent impetus to the construction program. At the end of 1907 Roosevelt had sixteen new battleships to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> [...] "Great White Fleet", which he sent on a cruise around the world. While nominally peaceful, and a valuable training exercise for the rapidly expanding Navy, it was also useful politically as a demonstration of United States power and capabilities; at every port, the politicians and naval officers of both potential allies and enemies were welcomed on board and given tours. The cruise had the desired effect, and American power was subsequently taken more seriously.|$|E
