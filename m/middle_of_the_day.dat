5|$|Australian ravens {{generally}} walk {{when moving}} {{around on the}} ground, though do hop when hurrying. They preen themselves frequently, particularly when roosting in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> They also engage in allopreening, where birds will preen each other's head and neck. This takes place particularly in autumn, winter and spring, and is important in pair bonding. Either member may initiate it, generally by landing near the other bird, shuffling next to its mate, then bending its head forward and presenting its nape.|$|E
5|$|Prisoners ate {{meals in}} their cells, {{from the early}} years of the prison through to its closure in 1991. Bread from the prison bakehouse was {{included}} in every meal in the convict era. It was served with black tea for breakfast, and with either tea or cocoa in the evening. The main meal, called dinner, was in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> and also featured soup, meat, and vegetables.|$|E
5|$|The flight muscles {{need to be}} kept at a {{suitable}} temperature for the dragonfly {{to be able to}} fly. Being cold-blooded, they can raise their temperature by basking in the sun. Early in the morning, they may choose to perch in a vertical position with the wings outstretched, while in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> a horizontal stance may be chosen. Another method of warming up used by some larger dragonflies is wing-whirring, a rapid vibration of the wings that causes heat to be generated in the flight muscles. The green darner (Anax junius) is known for its long-distance migrations, and often resorts to wing-whirring before dawn to enable it to make an early start.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} usually found in small groups, {{although}} substantial flocks can form at favoured sites. It walks well, without waddling, {{and although it}} normally feeds by upending, it can dive if necessary. It does not often perch in trees, unlike other whistling ducks. It flies at low altitude with slow wingbeats and trailing feet, in loose flocks rather than tight formation. It feeds {{during the day and}} at night in fairly large flocks, often with other whistling duck species, but rests or sleeps in smaller groups in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> They are noisy and display their aggression towards other individuals by throwing back their heads. Before taking off in alarm, they often shake their head sideways.|$|E
5|$|Reconstructions of the {{eruption}} {{and its effects}} vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted two days. The morning {{of the first day}} was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger. In the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> an explosion threw up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day pyroclastic surges in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights were seen on the peak interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild tsunami in the Bay of Naples. By late afternoon of the second day, {{the eruption}} was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.|$|E
5|$|While {{the battle}} was taking place, the 65mm {{artillery}}, four Napoleonchik canons, reached the front in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> and {{were placed on the}} Poria–Alumot ridge. It was the first Israeli artillery {{to be used in the}} war. At 13:20, they began to fire at the Syrians, and about 40 rounds the latter began to retreat. The Israelis also fired into Samakh, where the Syrian officers, who had until then believed that the Israelis had nothing that could hit their headquarters, took shelter. One projectile hit the Syrian ammunition depot in the village, and others ignited fires in the dry fields. While the soldiers who operated the cannons (still lacking sights) were not proficient in handling them, an acceptable level of accuracy was achieved after practice shots into the Sea of Galilee. In all, the artillery fire took the Syrian army by complete surprise, and the latter decided to regroup and retreat to Tel al-Qasr, also recalling the company at Sha'ar HaGolan and Masada. A total of 500 shells were fired by the Israeli artillery. Syrian officers may have shot some of their fleeing soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Unlike other Novomessor species, workers forage {{early in}} the morning and late {{afternoon}}, whereas N. cockerelli and N. albisetosus forage during the afternoon and evening. However, it is unknown whether or not these ants are active during the night. Foragers first emerge from their nests at 9 A.M. and return by 5 P.M. They are rarely seen during the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when temperatures reach 95–100°F (35–38°C), although the ground temperature is considerably higher. Workers are commonly seen foraging between 9 and 11 A.M. and 3 to 5 P.M. Most workers forage on the ground, but sometimes they can be seen walking on low herbage without feeding on the plants or collecting any seeds. Excavated nests showed no evidence that these ants collect seeds, and no workers were seen collecting them or carrying them back to the nest. N. ensifer ants are solitary foragers that work 25 ft (7 m) away from their home nest. N. ensifer predominately feeds on insects they prey on, consuming dead insects such as ichneumon wasps, bembicine wasps and small moths. When a worker discovers a dead insect, it will start to pull and carry it back to the nest immediately, and other nestmates will join once they detect it. Workers do not cooperate with each other and pull the insect from all directions, accidentally tearing it apart. However, the workers will eventually have a piece of the insect left and return it to the nest. The only known predator of N. ensifer is the giant horned lizard (Phrynosoma asio). Mites and Springtail arthropods are known to dwell inside nests, but their function or purpose within a colony is unknown.|$|E
