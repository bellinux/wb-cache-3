The towers were topped with long-range radio antennae to communicate via R-105 radio to other units. A distinctive feature of this type of tower was the prominent air intake box at ground level.|$|E
25|$|Brazil {{received}} an International Monetary Fund rescue package in mid-2002 of $30.4billion, then a record sum. Brazil's central bank paid back the IMF loan in 2005, {{although it was}} not due to be repaid until 2006. One of the issues the Central Bank of Brazil recently dealt with was an excess of speculative short-term capital inflows to the country, which may have contributed to a fall {{in the value of the}} U.S. dollar against the real during that period. Nonetheless, foreign direct investment (FDI), related to long-term, less speculative investment in production, is estimated to be $193.8billion for 2007. Inflation <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> currently plays a major part in the Central bank's role of setting out short-term interest rates as a monetary policy measure.|$|E

25|$|Corporate {{governance}} {{mechanisms and}} controls {{are designed to}} reduce the inefficiencies that arise from moral hazard and adverse selection. There are both internal monitoring systems and external monitoring systems. Internal monitoring can be done, for example, by one (or a few) large shareholder(s) {{in the case of}} privately held companies or a firm belonging to a business group. Furthermore, the various board mechanisms provide for internal monitoring. External monitoring of managers' behavior, occurs when an independent third party (e.g. the external auditor) attests the accuracy of information provided by management to investors. Stock analysts and debt holders may also conduct such external monitoring. An ideal <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> system should regulate both motivation and ability, while providing incentive alignment toward corporate goals and objectives. Care should be taken that incentives are not so strong that some individuals are tempted to cross lines of ethical behavior, for example by manipulating revenue and profit figures to drive the share price of the company up.|$|E

These regulated ventilation and made asbestosis an excusable work-related disease. The term mesothelioma was first used in medical literature in 1931; its association with asbestos was first noted sometime in the 1940s. Similar legislation followed in the U.S. about ten years later.|$|E

25|$|Introduced predators, in {{particular}} foxes, {{are a significant}} threat to the ground-nesting colonial seabirds and shorebirds of the Summerland Peninsula. Foxes were introduced to Phillip Island in 1907 and while various control methods have been implemented since 1918 none were successful. Fox <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> is difficult as foxes have high breeding productivity, are wary of humans, highly mobile, ecologically adaptable and their 'surplus kill' hunting behaviour can kill up to 30 penguins a night. In 2007 PINP established a dedicated fox eradication program {{with the aim of}} removing all foxes from Phillip Island and as a result there has been a decline in penguin moralities by foxes on the peninsula from 125 killed in 2007/2008 to five killed in the subsequent four years. In 2012 there was an estimated 11 foxes remaining across the whole of Phillip Island, if the program is successful Phillip Island will be the largest island from which red foxes have been eradicated.|$|E
25|$|An {{intelligent}} {{transportation system}} (ITS) {{is a system}} of hardware, software, and operators that allow better <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> of traffic in order to optimize traffic flow. As the number of vehicle lane miles traveled per year continues to increase dramatically, and {{as the number of}} vehicle lane miles constructed per year has not been keeping pace, this has led to ever-increasing traffic congestion. As a cost-effective solution toward optimizing traffic, ITS presents a number of technologies to reduce congestion by monitoring traffic flows through the use of sensors and live cameras or analysing cellular phone data travelling in cars (floating car data) and in turn rerouting traffic as needed through the use of variable message boards (VMS), highway advisory radio, on board or off board navigation devices and other systems through integration of traffic data with navigation systems. Additionally, the roadway network has been increasingly fitted with additional communications and control infrastructure to allow traffic operations personnel to monitor weather conditions, for dispatching maintenance crews to perform snow or ice removal, as well as intelligent systems such as automated bridge de-icing systems which help to prevent accidents.|$|E
