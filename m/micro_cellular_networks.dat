40|$|In this paper, a new {{mathematical}} {{framework to}} the analysis of millimeter wave <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> is introduced. Its peculiarity lies in considering realistic path-loss and blockage models, which are derived from experimental data recently reported in the literature. The path-loss model accounts for different distributions for line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight propagation conditions and the blockage model includes an outage state that provides a better representation of the outage possibilities of millimeter wave communications. By modeling the locations of the base stations as points of a Poisson point process and by relying upon a noise-limited approximation for typical millimeter wave network deployments, exact integral expressions for computing the coverage probability and the average rate are obtained. With the aid of Monte Carlo simulations, the noise-limited approximation is shown to be sufficiently accurate for typical network densities. Furthermore, it is shown that sufficiently dense millimeter wave <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> are capable of outperforming <b>micro</b> wave <b>cellular</b> <b>networks,</b> both in terms of coverage probability and average rate.

A substantial body of work has been carried out to improve the capacity of <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> by introducing ad hoc communica-tions, resulting in the so-called multihop <b>cellular</b> <b>networks.</b> Most of the previous research allows ad hoc transmissions between certain source and destination pairs to alleviate base stations’ relay burden. However, since reports show that Internet data traffic {{is becoming more and more}} dominant in <b>cellular</b> <b>networks,</b> we explore in this paper the capacity of multihop <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> with all traffic going through base stations and ad hoc transmissions only acting as relay. We first investigate the capacity of regular multihop <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> where both nodes and base stations are regularly placed. By fully exploiting the link rate variability, we find that multihop <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> can have higher per-node throughput than traditional <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> by a scaling factor of log 2 푛.
