5|$|Homer ignores {{his studies}} and instead focuses on his preconceived notions of college life through {{adolescent}} <b>movies</b> <b>and</b> <b>TV</b> shows, {{such as the}} fictional The School of Hard Knockers, which stereotype college life as pranks, partying and rigid deans. He also insults the college dean, Dean Peterson, believing {{him to be a}} crusty, conservative administrator. In reality, Peterson relates well with the students and is relatively young. Homer acts like a know-it-all in class and is asked to demonstrate how a proton accelerator operates; consequently, he causes a nuclear meltdown in class. Dean Peterson takes him aside and recommends hiring a tutor. The tutors turn out to be three computer nerds named Benjamin, Doug, and Gary. The trio try to help Homer understand the material from his physics course, but he refuses to cooperate. Instead, he is determined to help them gain a social life by pulling a prank on rival college Springfield A University. The prank involves kidnapping the other school's mascot, a pig named Sir Oinks-a-lot. However, Homer causes the pig to become very ill after feeding it malt liquor, and Benjamin, Doug, and Gary are blamed for the incident.|$|E
