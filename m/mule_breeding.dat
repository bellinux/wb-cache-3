5|$|Although the Poitevin was not {{the only}} breed of horse used for the {{production}} of mules, the Poitou mule was known worldwide. They were in high demand in the United States from the late 19th century until the beginning of World War I. During the 1920s, livestock production began to decline. In the Deux-Sèvres region, especially in the district of Melle, near Luçon and Saint-Maixent, <b>mule</b> <b>breeding</b> began to be concentrated in ateliers (workshops), which were relatively expensive for breeders.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, the <b>mule</b> <b>breeding</b> {{industry}} collapsed with the advent of mechanization.

A continued breeding of mules caused the breed to decline faster than other draft breeds, as purebred horses were not bred as often. By 1945, breed selection was oriented towards the production of meat, as the only remaining economic opportunity for farmers. The conformation of the breed changed slightly to become shorter, but the Poitevin remained unprofitable for horse meat, as breeders preferred to invest in herds of Comtois and Breton horses, which were faster growing and higher yielding.|$|E

500|$|Poitevin mares were {{crossbred}} with Poitou donkeys {{to create}} the famous Poitou mule, a large, hardy breed. As mules are hybrids, and thus sterile, they can only be created through crossing a donkey and a horse. The industry of <b>mule</b> <b>breeding</b> in Poitou has existed {{since at least the}} 18th century, when it was opposed by the government stud farm administration that was attempting to breed cavalry horses for French troops. At the beginning of the 19th century, the government prohibited breeding mules from mares taller than , and threatened to castrate all donkeys in the region. In the 1860s, equine historian Eugene Gayot described a horse that he called the [...] "poitevine mulassière", and stated that the main purpose of this breed was to produce mares from which to breed mules. He added that this breed was also called the Poitevin. Mares of many breeds were used to produce mules at that point in history, but Gayot noted that the heavy mares from the Poitou marshes produced the best mules, likely because the Poitevin mares bequeathed to their descendents the same heavy bone structure.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, the French {{government}} {{tried to}} impose a system of crossing Poitevin horses with lighter-weight Norman and Thoroughbred horses to create cavalry horses. Despite financial incentives, private breeders protested because they felt that the resulting crossbred horses created poor quality <b>mules</b> upon further <b>breeding.</b> The changes also affected the characteristics of the breed that had been developed for work in its marshy homeland, including large hooves and a calm manner. Some sources argue that at this point the breed was employed for agricultural and logging uses. Others state that they were not pulling horses, and were instead used almost solely for the production of mules.|$|R
40|$|Since equines play an {{important}} role in the economy of Himachal Pradesh, this study has examined the growth trends in equine population and socio-economic characteristics of equine-rearers. The problems being faced have been identified and some policy recommendations have been made. It has been found that equine population had a compound growth rate of 2. 57 per cent per annum during the period 1966 - 2003 and constituted about 1 per cent of the total livestock population in 2003. Amongst different constituents of equines, viz. horses, ponies, mules and donkeys, mules have shown the maximum rise in number. The contribution of equines has been assessed to be 40 per cent in the gross household income of rearers. A mule pair has been found to be highly profitable for load-carrying activities. Road links to the villages having modern means of transport have been perceived to be the greatest threat to equine-rearing activity, followed by its disliking by younger generations and nonavailability of locally-bred mules. The study has emphasized on increased supply of Chamurthi horses through identification of additional local breeders by adopting systematic breeding policy, particularly in the Pin Valley of Spiti area. Keeping in view the demand for <b>mules,</b> their <b>breeding</b> should be undertaken at both public and at private levels so that local-bred mules become available at affordable prices.

25|$|A {{limiting}} factor in Yucatán's economy was the poorness of the limestone soil, which could only support crops {{for two to}} three years with land cleared through slash and burn (swidden) agriculture. Access to water was a {{limiting factor}} on agriculture, with the limestone escarpment giving way in water filled sinkholes (cenotes), but rivers and streams were generally absent on the peninsula. Individuals had rights to land so long as they cleared and tilled them and when the soil was exhausted, they repeated the process. In general Indians lived in a dispersed pattern, which Spanish congregación or forced resettlement attempted to alter. Collective labor cultivated the confraternities' lands, which included raising the traditional maize, beans, and cotton. But confraternities also later pursued cattle ranching, as well as <b>mule</b> and horse <b>breeding,</b> depending on the local situation. There is evidence that cofradías in southern Campeche were involved in interregional trade in cacao as well as cattle ranching. Although generally the revenues from crops and animals were devoted to expenses in the spiritual sphere, cofradías' cattle were used for direct aid to community members during droughts, stabilizing the community's food supply.|$|R

40|$|Since its domestication, about 5000  years ago, {{the donkey}} (Equus asinus) has been {{extensively}} used as a work or draft animal in agricultural activities and for the transportation of people and goods. In the last century, technology improvement and growing mechanization strongly affected agriculture and the management and use of this livestock species in the industrialized countries. Nowadays, the use of donkeys for work or transport has almost disappeared, together {{with the need for}} <b>mules</b> or hinny <b>breeding.</b> During the last five decades, Italian autochthonous donkey populations suffered from a severe reduction in population size, which led to the extinction of several breeds. At present, eight breeds remain, all classified by FAO as critically endangered or endangered: Asinara, Pantesco, Grigio Siciliano, Romagnolo, Amiatino, Sardo Grigio, Martina Franca, and Ragusano. To evaluate the extant genetic variability of Italian donkeys, we typed 16 microsatellite loci in 258 individuals from these breeds.

40|$|Ducks (common, Muscovy and mule ducks) are {{the third}} most {{important}} bird species in animal production for human consumption worldwide. Our study aimed to improve the efficiency of <b>mule</b> duck <b>breeding,</b> thus contributing to the efficiency of food production in general. In the common duck, females can be bred either with males {{of the same species}} (i. e. in pure breeding (PB) subscript p) or in inter-generic crossbreeding (CB; subscript c) with Muscovy drakes to produce the hybrid mule duck. The aim {{of the present study was}} to estimate the genetic parameters of several indicators of duration of fertility, considered to be a trait of the female duck, within and between breeding schemes and, in particular, to estimate the purebred–crossbred genetic correlation (rgpc). These indicators were maximum duration of fertility (MD), that is, the time interval between insemination and the last fertilised egg, the number of fertile eggs (F) and of hatched ducklings (H) after a single artificial insemination (AI), and the fertility rate over days 2 to 12 after AI (F 2, 12), taking three sub-periods (F 2, 4, F 5, 8, F 9, 12) into account. A total of 494 females and 2655 inseminations were involved. PB resulted in longer duration of fertility (MDp 58. 1 v. MDc 56. 4 days). Heritability (h 2) was higher for MDp (estimate 6 s. e. : 0. 2760. 04) than for MDc (0. 1560. 04), but both traits were highly correlated with each other (rgpc 50. 8560. 07). Fp and Fc had similar heritability (h 2 around 0. 24) and displayed a high genetic correlation (0. 7860. 07). The same was true for Hp and Hc (h 2 around 0. 17 and rgpc 50. 8860. 05). The heritability estimates were 0. 2460. 03 for F 2, 12 p and 0. 2060. 04 for F 2, 12 c, with a 0. 8060. 07 genetic correlation between each other. Permanent environmental effects influenced MDp far less than MDc, Fp less than Fc, but Hp and Hc to the same extent. The high values for rgpc (. 0. 78) indicated that thesame genes are involved in the duration of fertility for both PB and CB. Unlike CB, initial fertility for PB (F 2, 4 p) was not correlated to overall fertility rate and to duration of fertility and probably involves different genes, if any. In both breeding schemes, indirect selection on F would be better than direct selection on H to improve H, and easier to implement than selection on MD. Moreover, any gain in one breeding scheme will have its correlated counterpart in the other one, because of the high values of rgpc...|$|R
6000|$|A {{species may}} be highly variable, but {{distinct}} races {{will not be}} formed, if from any cause selection be not applied. It {{would be difficult to}} select slight variations in fishes from their place of habitation; and though the carp is extremely variable and is much attended to in Germany, only one well- marked race has been formed, as I hear from Lord A. Russell, namely the spiegel-carpe; and this is carefully secluded from the common scaly kind. On the other hand, a closely allied species, the gold-fish, from being reared in small vessels, and from having been carefully attended to by the Chinese, has yielded many races. Neither the bee, which has been semi-domesticated from an extremely remote period, nor the cochineal insect, which was cultivated by the aboriginal Mexicans (21/48. Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page 49. 'On the Cochineal Insect' page 46.), has yielded races; and {{it would be impossible to}} match the queen-bee with any particular drone, and most difficult to match cochineal insects. Silk-moths, on the other hand, have been subjected to rigorous selection, and have produced a host of races. Cats, which from their nocturnal habits cannot be selected for breeding, do not, as formerly remarked, yield distinct races within the same country. Dogs are held in abomination in the East, and their breeding is neglected; consequently, as Prof. Moritz Wagner (21/49. 'Die Darwin'sche Theorie und das Migrationsgesetz der Organismen' 1868 page 19.) remarks, one kind alone exists there. The ass in England varies much in colour and size; but as it is an animal of little value and bred by poor people, there has been no selection, and distinct races have not been formed. We must not attribute the inferiority of our asses to climate, for in India they are of even smaller size than in Europe. But when selection is brought to bear on the ass, all is changed. Near Cordova, as I am informed (February 1860) by Mr. W.E. Webb, C.E., they are carefully bred, as much as 200 pounds having been paid for a stallion ass, and they have been immensely improved. In Kentucky, asses have been imported (for <b>breeding</b> <b>mules)</b> from Spain, Malta, and France; these [...] "seldom averaged more than fourteen hands high: but the Kentuckians, by great care, have raised them up to fifteen hands, and sometimes even to sixteen. The prices paid for these splendid animals, for such they really are, will prove how much they are in request. One male, of great celebrity, was sold for upwards of one thousand pounds sterling." [...] These choice asses are sent to cattle-shows, a day being given for their exhibition. (21/50. Capt. Marryat quoted by Blyth in 'Journ. Asiatic Soc. of Bengal' volume 28 page 229.) ...|$|R

The less restrictive organizations allow registration of a horse of any breed or combination of breeds with as little as three square inches of white above the knees or hocks, not including facial markings. Some pinto registries do not accept animals with draft horse or <b>mule</b> <b>breeding,</b> though others do.

50|$|Sawers (2005) {{shows how}} {{southern}} farmers made the mule their preferred draft {{animal in the}} South during the 1860s-1920s, primarily because it fit better with the region's geography. Mules better withstood the heat of summer, and their smaller size and hooves were well suited for such crops as cotton, tobacco, and sugar. The character of soils and climate in the lower South hindered the creation of pastures, so the <b>mule</b> <b>breeding</b> industry was concentrated in the border states of Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Transportation costs combined with topography to influence the prices of mules and horses, which in turn affected patterns of mule use. The economic and production advantages associated with mules made their use a progressive step for Southern agriculture that endured until the mechanization brought by tractors. Beginning around the mid-20th century, Texas began to transform from a rural and agricultural state to one that was urban and industrialized.|$|E

The government of India subsequently instructed the Punjab government to impose these conditions on the new colony.

British officials in the Punjab were initially opposed to the scheme, arguing that it risked jeopardising the entire colony, and questioning the region's supposed popularity for and prowess in horse-breeding.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{changes in the}} use of horses as a power technology during nineteenth century industrialization. Though the conventional narrative of industrialization has emphasized the replacement of animal power, the use of equine prime movers expanded throughout the nineteenth century. According to census reports, the horse population multiplied six fold between 1840 and 1900, and horses supplied the majority of power in the United States until 1880. Case studies on the transportation revolution, the Civil War, and postbellum industrial capitalism reveal how horse technology complemented other technological developments and was integral to the industrial ecology. An expanding railroad network caused a corresponding expansion {{in the use of}} horses for short-distance transportation and for agricultural production, and stimulated <b>mule</b> <b>breeding</b> in the South. During the Civil War, horse supply was a factor in Union military success. In the postbellum decades, agricultural mechanization and urban growth employed horses for motive power in crop production, commercial hauling, mass transit, and construction. Horse breeders responded to changing markets by importing foreign horses to breed draft horses and other specialized horses for a growing array of tasks. However, {{by the end of the}} century, many people suggested there was a growing contradiction in using horses as machines. The continued use of horses in the cities was questioned by advocates of animal welfare, social and technical efficiency, scientific management, public health and urban reform, who argued that horses had no place in modern society. Thus, the rapid adoption of the automobile occurred for ideological as well as technical reasons. Despite this shift in values and the widening use of electricity and internal combustion, horses disappeared slowly from American society over five decades. Very gradually, horse technology moved from a central to a peripheral position within the industrial system, but until the middle of the twentieth century, horses occupied a niche no other prime mover could fill. ...|$|E
40|$|Domestic equids, namely, horses (Equus caballus), donkeys (Equus asinus), {{and their}} hybrid offspring, mules (Equus caballus x Equus asinus), played an {{essential}} role in the Roman world. As pack animals, they served in both public and private sectors in the Roman daily life. According to written sources, mules in particular were used predominantly as pack animals by the military and enabled the transport of troops, the transport of supplies, and large weaponry to every corner of the empire. The production of mules requires the presence of both male donkey and female horse, and thus <b>mule</b> <b>breeding</b> in northern Europe would necessitate the importation of donkeys to regions outside of their natural distribution and/or the import of mules from elsewhere. The importation and export of domestic equids has indeed been described in historical sources but not recognised in the zooarchaeological record. As a result, the significant predominance of horses over donkeys and mules in Roman Britain is not currently well understood. This is mainly due to the issue of species identification. The thesis aims to refine the existing methods and develop new techniques to more accurately distinguish between different domestic equid species in an attempt to obtain, not only the representative frequency of different domestic equid species in selected Romano-British sites, but also to observe different isotopic values (oxygen, carbon, and strontium) of selected specimens in order to discuss their localness. The results suggest that, while both donkeys and mules do exist in Roman Britain, the scarce presence of donkeys and the foreign isotopic signature of possible mules imply that these two species were not systematically introduced into Roman Britain. This study shows the potential of the use of species frequency and isotopic analyses for examining the procurement strategies of domestic equids in Roman Britain...|$|E
40|$|Evidence for pre-Roman Iron Age {{through to}} post-Roman {{activity}} was revealed during a major programme of archaeological investigation undertaken {{as an integral}} part of the construction scheme to widen the A 1 trunk road between Dishforth and Leeming Bar in North Yorkshire. Significant archaeological remains were encountered at Healam Bridge, a scheduled Roman settlement located on Dere Street Roman road, midway between the walled towns of Isuriam Brigantum and Cataractonium (the modern villages of Aldborough and Catterick). This two-volume set presents the results and discussion of the excavations and analysis of the environmental and human remains (Volume 1), and the analysis of the artefactual assemblages (Volume 2). Evidence from Healam Bridge indicates activity dating from the early 2 nd century AD into the Anglo-Saxon period. The location of the site astride the main Roman route to the north of England and Scotland was reflected in the wide range of pottery and other finds recovered, and activities such as iron-smithing are likely to have served the passing trade as much as the local community. The extensive animal bone assemblage suggested that horse, possibly <b>mule,</b> <b>breeding</b> was a significant activity at Healam Bridge throughout the Roman period.
