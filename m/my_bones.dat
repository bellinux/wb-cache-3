500|$|It {{was during}} Abbot Pescall's tenure, in 1530, that Cardinal Thomas Wolsey visited the abbey. Wolsey was an {{influential}} {{minister in the}} government of King Henry VIII. He fell from favour after failing to secure papal permission for Henry to divorce his wife Katherine of Aragon, and on 4 November 1530 was arrested for treason. While en route from Yorkshire to London, where Wolsey would be held prisoner, he fell ill. The journey took Wolsey through Leicester, and he arrived at the abbey on 26 November, declaring: [...] "Father abbott, I ame come hether to leave <b>my</b> <b>bones</b> among you". Wolsey died on 30 November and the public were allowed to view his remains before he was interred within the abbey's church.|$|E
500|$|During the track, Rihanna's vocal range spans one octave, {{from the}} low note of B3 to the high note of B4. Proposing illicit acts, she uses a [...] "sexually {{aggressive}} tone" [...] in her vocal performance. The lyrics are about sex, sadomasochism, bondage and BDSM fetishes, including the sexual fantasies and turn-ons of its protagonist. The song opens with the hook, [...] "Na, na, na, c'mon". During the chorus the lyrics include, [...] "'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it / Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it." [...] In the song, Rihanna describes herself as [...] "bad" [...] and openly praises her own sexual prowess; lyrics include, [...] "Sticks and stones may break <b>my</b> <b>bones</b> / But chains and whips excite me." [...] Rihanna told Spin magazine that the lyrics are metaphoric. She said that she thought the song was mainly about having confidence in one's identity, and about being impervious to rumors and criticism. According to Jake Conway of Q Magazine at Yale, the lyrics are guilty of [...] "divesting sex of emotion" [...] and re-envisaging violence as fetish; {{he went on to}} say that Rihanna pays homage to the sexual acts in an empowered dance and club mood. Chris Ryan described the song as being about [...] "dirty, naughty, illicit bedroom activities".|$|E

2500|$|Aeneas {{finishes}} his story, and Dido realizes {{that she has}} {{fallen in love with}} Aeneas. Juno seizes upon this opportunity to make a deal with Venus, Aeneas's mother, with the intention of distracting Aeneas from his destiny of founding a city in Italy. Aeneas is inclined to return Dido's love, and during a hunting expedition, a storm drives them into a cave in which Aeneas and Dido presumably have sex, an event that Dido takes to indicate a marriage between them. But when Jupiter sends Mercury to remind Aeneas of his duty, he {{has no choice but to}} part. Her heart broken, Dido commits suicide by stabbing herself upon a pyre with Aeneas's sword. Before dying, she predicts eternal strife between Aeneas's people and hers; [...] "rise up from <b>my</b> <b>bones,</b> avenging spirit" [...] (4.625, trans.

Author Stephen Greenblatt in Will in the World, suggests that as Shakespeare lay dying, [...] "he tried to forget his wife and then remembered her with the second-best bed.

2500|$|In the Roman epic of Virgil, the Aeneid, Queen Dido, the Greek {{name for}} Elissa, is first {{introduced}} {{as a highly}} esteemed character. In just seven years, since their exodus from Tyre, the Carthaginians have rebuilt a successful kingdom under her rule. Her subjects adore her and present her with a festival of praise. Her character is perceived by Virgil as even more noble when she offers asylum to Aeneas and his men, who have recently escaped from Troy. A spirit {{in the form of}} the messenger god, Mercury, sent by Jupiter, reminds Aeneas that his mission is not to stay in Carthage with his new-found love, Dido, but to sail to Italy to found Rome. Virgil ends his legend of Dido with the story that, when Aeneas tells Dido, her heart broken, she orders a pyre to be built where she falls upon Aeneas' sword. As she lay dying, she predicted eternal strife between Aeneas' people and her own: [...] "rise up from <b>my</b> <b>bones,</b> avenging spirit" [...] (4.625, trans. Fitzgerald) she says, an invocation of Hannibal. The details of Virgil's story do not, however, form part of the original legend and are significant mainly as an indication of Rome's attitude towards the city she had destroyed, exemplified by Cato the Elder's much-repeated utterance, [...] "Carthago delenda est", [...] "Carthage must be destroyed".|$|E
