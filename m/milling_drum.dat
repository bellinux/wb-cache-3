5000|$|In April 1964, Van Morrison {{established}} an R&B club at the Maritime Hotel, Belfast with entrepreneurs Jimmy Conlon, Jerry McKernan and Gerry McKervey (known as the [...] "3Js"). Morrison gave notice {{to the group}} with which he performed at the time, the Golden Eagles. With an anticipated opening night for the new R&B club approaching, he embarked {{on a mission to}} find his ideal line-up. He had recently been introduced to The Gamblers, an East Belfast group formed in 1962 by Ronnie <b>Milling</b> (<b>drums,</b> born 27 April 1940), Billy Harrison (guitar and lead vocals, born William Harrison on 14 October 1942), and Alan Henderson (bass guitar, born 26 November 1944, died 9 April 2017). Eric Wrixon, who was still in school, had been recruited as piano player and keyboardist. Morrison joined in on tenor saxophone, harmonica and vocals. The group rehearsed over Dougie Knight's bicycle shop in Shaftesbury Square, Belfast in preparation for their debut at the Maritime. As the group now felt they needed a new name, they followed Eric Wrixon's suggestion and the Gamblers changed to Them after the 1954 sci-fi horror film.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Current {{issues of}} energy saving in cement production, using {{technological}} milling complex, {{which includes a}} press roller crusher and ball mill, discussed in the article. Optimized milling conditions of previously ground material through the installation of energy-exchange blade devices (EBD) in amill drum have been proposed. It {{was found that the}} level of charge by grinding media in the first chamber periodically varies according to the rotation angle of the <b>mill</b> <b>drum</b> equipped with EBD. There is a "scooping " of the grinding media with a grinding material in the zone of active influence of EBD along, lifting them to a height and enforcing them a cross-longitudinal movement. All that is different from being created in the ball mills without EBD. The additional work is performed, which consumes engine power. Method of calculating anadditional power consumption of the mill drive equipped with EBD was proposed; additional power expended to create cross-longitudinal motion of the grinding mediain the first and second chambers initsareas of activein fluence of EBD.

Formed in 1980 by singer Michael Stipe, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Mike <b>Mills,</b> and <b>drummer</b> Bill Berry, {{the band was}} pivotal {{in the development of}} the alternative rock genre. Their musical style inspired several other alternative rock bands and musicians, and the band became one of the first alternative rock acts to experience breakthrough commercial success.

50|$|After promotional duties {{for their}} {{previous}} album Out of Time in May 1991, {{the members of}} R.E.M. began work on their next album. Starting {{the first week of}} June, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Mike <b>Mills,</b> and <b>drummer</b> Bill Berry met several times a week in a rehearsal studio to work on new material. Once a month they would take a week-long break. The musicians would often trade instruments: Buck would play mandolin, Mills would play piano or organ and Berry would play bass. Buck explained that writing without drums was productive for the band members. The band, intent on delivering an album of harder-rocking material after Out of Time, made an effort to write some faster rock songs during rehearsals, but came up with less than a half-dozen prospective songs in that vein.|$|R

The properties of a commercial product were compared to those of an experimental material obtained by seed pressure cooking, <b>milling</b> and <b>drum</b> drying. Available starch content varied between 29 and 35 % (d. m. b.), whereas retrograded resistant starch (RS) levels ranged between 2. 7 and 3. 7 %.

5000|$|... "Sitting Still" [...] {{reflects}} R.E.M.'s folk rock influences. [...] Peter Buck's guitar riffs {{have been}} compared to those of The Byrds. [...] The song's verses have a call and response structure, with Buck's guitar arpeggios responding to Stipe's vocal line. [...] Allmusic critic Stewart Mason states {{that this is one}} of the few R.E.M. songs in which <b>Mills</b> and <b>drummer</b> Bill Berry act as a traditional rhythm section, propelling the song forward together.

A simple nylon guide is used to ensure both discs activate simultaneously to jam the discs between each drum ramp and the frame's lock ring.|$|R
50|$|A road {{recycler}} or road reclaimer is an {{asphalt pavement}} grinder {{or a combination}} grinder and soil stabilizer when it is equipped to blending cement, foamed asphalt and/or lime and water with the existing pavement (usually only very thin asphalt) to create a new, recycled road surface. It usually refers {{to the process of}} blending the asphalt road with a binder and base course in a single pass.In the photo below of the <b>milling</b> cutter <b>drums,</b> the front drum with many teeth would be from a pavement mill and would be used to remove very hard asphalt or concrete surfaces. The drums behind with less teeth would be from a road recycler, the teeth are placed in a chevron pattern to reduce the load on the motor. Only a few teeth are cutting at one time and this pattern of teeth placement also serves to auger the material to the centre where it can be picked up easily by a conveyor belt.|$|R
