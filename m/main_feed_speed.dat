40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{evaluate}} a noninvasive method to assess table <b>feed</b> <b>speed</b> (mm/s) in modern commercial computed tomography (CT) systems. The table feed (mm/rotation) was measured at selected nominal table <b>feed</b> <b>speeds,</b> given as low (26. 67 mm/s), intermediate (48. 00 mm/s), and high (64. 00 mm/s), by utilizing a computed radiography (CR) cassette installed with a photostimulable phosphor plate. The cassette was placed on the examination table to travel through the isocenter longitudinally, with a total scan length of over 430 mm. The distance travelled was employed to determine the total table feed length. To calculate the table <b>feed</b> <b>speed,</b> gantry rotation time was measured concurrently at a preselected nominal rotation time of 750 ms. Upon completion of data acquisition, the table feed and gantry rotation time were analyzed and used to calculate the actual table <b>feed</b> <b>speed</b> (mm/s). Under the low table <b>feed</b> <b>speed</b> setting, the table <b>feed</b> <b>speed</b> was found to be 26. 67 mm/s.

30|$|The {{effect of}} the helix angle of a router bit on chip {{formation}} and electric energy per volume (specific energy) under different <b>feed</b> <b>speeds</b> and cutting depths during the milling of maple and China fir by a computer numerically controlled (CNC) router was investigated. The peripheral cutting edge of router bits were custom-made at helix angles of 0 °, 2 °, 4 °, 6 °, and 8 °. The <b>feed</b> <b>speed</b> varied from 600 to 4800 mm/min, and the depths of cut were set at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 mm. The chips were classified by sieving into a flake type, a splinter type (5 and 10 mesh), a flow type (20 and 40 mesh), and a granule type (< 40 mesh). As the <b>feed</b> <b>speed</b> and the cutting depth increased for the five router bits, more chips of the flake type and the splinter type were produced. However, the number of granule-type chips under the larger helix angle was reduced. The energy per volume removed (specific energy) increased with the <b>feed</b> <b>speed</b> {{and the depth of}} cut while milling maple and China fir.

The influence of cutting speed of diamond wire saw, work-piece <b>feed</b> <b>speed</b> and rotating speed of work-piece on cutting process were analyzed.

Design/methodology/approach: Welding experiments were conducted with various wire <b>feed</b> <b>speeds</b> of 0. 5 m/min, 1. 0 m/min, and 1. 5 m/min, and the bead characteristics were evaluated. As shape factors of the weld bead, the bead width, back bead width, and bead cross-section area were measured. According to the weld quality and defined objective functions, the wire <b>feed</b> <b>speed</b> was optimized for various welding speeds. Findings: The wire <b>feed</b> <b>speed</b> that induces the optimum weld quality was found with welding speeds of 0. 5 m/min, 1. 0 m/min, and 1. 5 m/min. The optimum lap welding conditions were then suggested for 1. 6 mm aluminium alloy considering the productivity and quality. Research limitations/implications: The optimization will be extended to various aluminium alloys and the optimized results will be stored in the Al welding database of the intelligent welding power source development. Practical implications: With the increase of the welding speed for aluminium sheet welding, the corresponding wire <b>feed</b> <b>speed</b> should increase as well. On the other hand, {{it is clear that}} the maximum value of the objective function has decreased.
