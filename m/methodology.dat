5|$|Weber's <b>methodology</b> was {{developed}} {{in the context of a}} wider debate about <b>methodology</b> of social sciences, the Methodenstreit. Weber's position was close to historicism, as he understood social actions as being heavily tied to particular historical contexts and its analysis required the understanding of subjective motivations of individuals (social actors). Thus Weber's <b>methodology</b> emphasises the use of comparative historical analysis. Therefore, Weber was more interested in explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predicting an outcome of those processes in the future.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this chapter is to compare different weighting <b>methodologies</b> and different multicriteria decision-making <b>methodologies</b> for sustainability decision making. Four weighting <b>methodologies</b> and four multicriteria decision-making <b>methodologies</b> have been compared in this chapter; the weighting <b>methodologies</b> comprise two objective <b>methodologies</b> (entropy method and ideal point method) and two subjective <b>methodologies</b> (analytic hierarchy process and Delphi method), the multicriteria decision-making <b>methodologies</b> consist of four options, including technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution, data envelopment analysis, preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation, and principal component analysis. The proposed weighting <b>methodologies</b> and multicriteria decision-making <b>methodologies</b> have been compared by applying them on sustainability decision making among five energy scenarios.

40|$|This report {{presents}} various <b>methodologies</b> used in {{new product}} development and product innovation and discusses {{the relevance of}} these <b>methodologies</b> for service development and service innovation. The service innovation relevance {{for all of the}} <b>methodologies</b> presented is evaluated along several service specific dimensions, like intangibility, inseparability, heterogeneity, perishability, information intensity, and co-creation. The <b>methodologies</b> discussed are mainly collected from the Product Development and Management Association (PDMA) glossary. The main conclusions of the report are that several <b>methodologies</b> have been identified that may be applied to service innovation with no or minor adjustments. However, it seems that most of the relevant <b>methodologies</b> are process oriented <b>methodologies</b> focusing the open front end of the innovation process. Fewer <b>methodologies</b> are found for the stimulation of innovation conditions for service innovation, for service innovation value assessment or outcome evaluation and for specific types of service innovations. This implies that service innovation <b>methodologies</b> must be developed and validated for the elements of service innovation not currently well supported by appropriate <b>methodologies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Because of {{the great}} {{interest}} in using multiagent systems (MAS) {{in a wide variety}} of applications in recent years, agentoriented <b>methodologies</b> and related modeling techniques have become a priority for the development of large scale agentbased systems. The work we present here belongs to the disciplines of Software Engineering and Distributed Artificial Intelligence. More specifically, we are interested in software engineering aspects involved in the development of multiagent systems (MAS). Several <b>methodologies</b> have been proposed for the development of MAS. For the most part, these <b>methodologies</b> remain incomplete: they are either an extension of object-oriented <b>methodologies</b> or an extension of knowledge-based <b>methodologies.</b> In addition, too little effort has gone into the standardization of MAS <b>methodologies,</b> platforms and environments. It seems obvious, therefore, that software engineering aspects of the development of MAS still remain an open field. The success of the agent paradigm requires systematic <b>methodologies</b> for the specification, analysis and design of "non toy" MAS applications. We here present a framework called MUCCMAS, which stands for MUltidimensional framework of Criteria for the Comparison of MAS <b>methodologies,</b> that enabled us to make a comparative analysis of existing main MAS <b>methodologies.</b> The overall results of this comparative analysis are presented here. Results from this work have also lead us to propose a unification scheme, much in the same spirit as that of UML, for MAS <b>methodologies.</b> Our goal is to make MAS design and development more systematic and to contribute to the standardisation of MAS <b>methodologies</b> and platforms...|$|R
