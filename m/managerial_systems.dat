40|$|Purpose - It {{is argued}} that whilst {{operational}} and support processes deliver performance presently, it is the managerial processes that sustain performance over time. The purpose of this research paper is to better understand what these managerial processes are and how they influence organisational performance. Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical background is reviewed covering literature {{on the subject of}} business process management, resourced-based view (RBV), dynamic capabilities and managerial processes. A research framework leads to qualitative case study-based research design. Data are collected from 37 organisations across Europe, classified according to their performance. Findings - Findings suggest that the five managerial processes and their constituent managerial activities, identified through the empirical research, influence performance of organisations as an interconnected <b>managerial</b> <b>system</b> rather than as individual processes and activities. Also, the execution and maturity of this <b>managerial</b> <b>system</b> is influenced by the perceptions of the managers who organise it. Research limitations/implications - Within the limitation of the study the discussion leads to eight research propositions that contribute to our understanding of how managerial processes influence organisational performance. These propositions and ensuing discussion provide insights into the content and structure of managerial processes, as well as contributing to the debate on RBV by suggesting that managerial processes and activities could be considered as valuable, rare and inimitable resources. Furthermore, the discussion on how managerial perceptions influence the organisation and execution of the <b>managerial</b> <b>system</b> contributes towards our understanding of how and why dynamic capabilities develop. Practical implications - The results suggest that in higher performing organisations, managers: demonstrate a wider awareness of the overall managerial system; achieve a balance between short-term and future-oriented activities; exploit their managerial activities for multiple purposes; demonstrate greater maturity of managerial activities; and pay greater attention to the organisation of the <b>managerial</b> <b>system.</b> Originality/value - This paper presents one of the first empirical studies that attempt to understand how business processes, and particularly managerial processes, as an interconnected <b>managerial</b> <b>system</b> serve to sustain performance of organisations...|$|R

40|$|A firm's {{ability to}} manage its {{knowledge-based}} resource capabilities has become increasingly important {{as a result of}} performance threats triggered by technology change and intense competition. At the manufacturing plant level, we focus on three repositories of knowledge that drive performance. First, the physical production or information systems represent knowledge embedded in the plant's technical systems. Second, the plant's workforce has knowledge, including diverse scientific information and skills, to effectively operate the technical systems. Third, the firm's <b>managerial</b> <b>systems</b> embody knowledge in the form of goals, reward systems, and control and coordination systems. Taken together, we consider the technical systems, workforce knowledge, and the <b>managerial</b> <b>systems</b> as the plant's knowledge-based resource capability. Two normative models are introduced offering insight on how plant performance is impacted by investments in workforce knowledge (training) or the technical systems (process change). The models explicitly recognize that the outcome of investments in knowledge-based change is uncertain due to factors including technical problems, worker resistance, and limited financial resources. Also, we recognize that workforce knowledge may be deployed to mitigate the outcome uncertainty encountered with process change. Investments in knowledge-based change cannot be fully understood in isolation of the <b>managerial</b> <b>systems.</b> In one model, the plant manager is motivated by an incentive system that rewards the realization of a threshold goal, whereas in the other model the incentive system emphasizes the realization of meeting a particular target goal. We also investigate the impact of the manager's view of uncertainty (her willingness to absorb risk), which is influenced by the <b>managerial</b> <b>systems.</b> Results show that different characterizations of the <b>managerial</b> <b>systems</b> {{have a profound effect on}} managerial behavior and plant-level performance. knowledge-based resource capabilities, process change, workforce training, knowledge management, <b>managerial</b> <b>systems,</b> uncertainty...|$|E
