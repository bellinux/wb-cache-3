40|$|AbstractAn {{attempt is}} made to {{study the effects of}} gamma {{irradiation}} on multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with a specific focus on surface modification, structural changes and identification of irradiation generated defects on their surface. The as-received MWCNTs were chemically treated in order to attach required functional group on the surface and to remove traces of metallic impurities. The MWCNTs were then gamma irradiated at 25, 50, 75 and 100 kGy doses. Micro Raman analysis was performed on irradiated MWCNTs to estimate the irradiation induced defects on their surface, which revealed that the number of defects increased with dose. XRD analysis was also performed to observe the same and it was revealed that the MWCNTs were subjected to <b>micro-straining.</b> The selective area electron diffraction pattern revealed that traces of amorphous carbon were formed after irradiation. Various defects such as bending, variation of internal and external diameter, wall damages formed on the MWCNTs was verified using TEM. It is concluded that subjecting MWCNTs to irradiation sources has produced structural changes and defects on their surface which can influence the properties of nanocomposites...|$|E
40|$|The normal biomass {{level in}} the {{conventional}} activated sludge reactor is generally limited to between 2, 000 and 3, 000 mg/L due to the oxygen transfer limitation {{and the need for}} effective sludge settling in the secondary clarifier. In order to eliminate these two constraints, an exploratory study has been carried out to use hydrogen peroxide as the oxygen source in a non-aerated sludge blanket reactor containing a biomass level of 18, 000 - 52, 000 mg/L. The thick sludge blanket can effectively retain most of the produced bio-solids, leaving an effluent with SS levels between 50 and 350 mg/L, which may be polished by settling, <b>micro-straining,</b> or even slow sand filtration for small treatment plants. It has been found that an influent dosing of 800 mg/L H 2 O 2 does not induce any peroxide toxicity. This dosing provides an oxygen supply of 376 mg/L, which can satisfy a theoretical COD removal of 750 mg/L based on a cell yield coefficient of 0. 50. Of course, the actual COD removal is somewhat lower because a portion of the oxygen supply is consumed by biomass respiration. In treating a synthetic influent containing a TOC of 300 to 500 mg/L (with a COD/TOC ratio of 2. 65) and an HRT of 0. 33 to 1. 0 hour, the reactor can accept an organic loading of up to 36 kgTOC/m 3 -day (over 50 times higher than the conventional activated sludge system) with a 50 % organic removal efficiency. When the loading rate is reduced to 7. 2 kgTOC/m 3 -day, the efficiency increases to 82 %. Actually, the extent of TOC removal is largely dictated by the level of peroxide dosing since in this type of reactor, the biomass level is very high and the organic stabilization rate is not dictated by microbial activities. The capital requirement for such a compact reactor is less than 5 % of that for the conventional activated sludge plant since its reactor volume is only 2 to 3 % of the aeration tank, and {{there is no need for}} blowers or other aeration equipment. The operating cost is higher as 1. 0 kg of oxygen supply from peroxide is about HK$ 12 /kgO 2, while that from diffuser aeration is only HK$ 1. 5 to HK$ 2. 0 /kgO 2. Nevertheless, for a small plant with a treatment capacity of 500 m 3 /day treating an influent COD of 500 mg/L, the daily oxygen required is only 112. 5 kg/day (equivalent to a peroxide cost of HKD$ 1, 350 /day or HK$ 2. 7 /m 3), which can be easily offset by the tremendous capital saving for the plant installation.

40|$|Ultra-lightweight alloys {{with high}} strength, {{ductility}} and corrosion resistance are desirable for {{applications in the}} automotive, aerospace, biomedical, sporting and electronic goods sectors. Of these materials, magnesium (Mg) is the lightest (~ 1. 74 g/cm 3) of the structural metals, significantly lighter than steel, titanium and aluminium alloys. A new class of Mg alloys containing lithium (Li) were first developed by the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the 1960 s with ultra-low densities (1. 33 - 1. 65 g/cm 3) that are arguably the most lightweight of the engineering alloys. These alloys can also contain single- and multiple-phase microstructures depending on alloying additions and processing. Binary MgLi alloys have a Li content dependent microstructure: Type I - hexagonal close-packed (HCP) Mg structure (termed &# 945; phase) (0 to 5 wt. % Li); Type II - mixed &# 945;+&# 946; structure where &# 946; phase is body-centered cubic (BCC) (5 to 10. 3 wt. % Li); and Type III - fully BCC &# 946; phase structure (> 10. 3 wt. % Li). A new type of MgLi alloy was developed recently that contains (wt. %) Mg- 10. 95 Li- 3. 29 Al- 0. 59 Y. In its near-equilibrium state (hot extruded and air cooled), this alloy has the &# 945;+&# 946; structure (Type II) and a small volume fraction of intermetallic compounds, such as Al 2 Y. In this state, the alloy is soft and ductile, but highly susceptible to corrosion. However, this alloy was also capable of generating a unique property profile after further thermal and mechanical processing, i. e. high strength, appreciable ductility and good corrosion resistance (Xu et al., Nature Materials, vol. 14, p. 1229, 2015). Such a property profile was argued to {{be a result of}} the formation of both an unusual Li-rich solute nanostructure within the single-phase BCC Mg-rich &# 946; matrix and a uniform lithium-carbonate film on the alloy surface. While this MgLi alloy demonstrated an exceptional structural and mechanical (+ corrosion) response to heat treatment, many processing parameters are still not well understood regarding its hardening and softening behaviour. Hence, this thesis focuses on the structural and mechanical response of this MgLi alloy to thermal processing. It was found that the alloy quench-hardened after solution treatment at temperatures greater than 200 °C but age-softened during holding at temperatures as low as room temperature. The unusual Li-rich solute nanostructure that forms in the BCC &# 946; matrix of the alloy after water quenching from 400 °C was investigated systematically for understanding if this type of structure was major cause of the considerable quench-hardening and subsequent softening during ageing over a range of temperatures (20 to 220 °C). Here, in-situ high energy synchrotron small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), in conjunction with conventional X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), were used for the structural studies, with hardness used mainly for tracking changes in mechanical properties. The quench-hardening effect of the MgLi alloy was most dramatic after solution treatment at temperatures greater than 200 °C, with maximum hardening achieved above 300 °C; Vickers hardness increased from ~ 60 HV in the extruded state to 130 HV after this heat treatment. Here, the as-extruded alloy consisted mainly of BCC &# 946; phase, along {{with a small amount of}} HCP &# 945; phase and the insoluble intermetallic compound, Al 2 Y, according to analysis of XRD and SEM. After solution treatment for 10 min at 400 °C followed by water quenching, the &# 945; phase was dissolved and the microstructure consisted of coarse equiaxed &# 946; phase grains and some undissolved Al 2 Y. The notable observation was the presence of distinct sidebands on each side of the prominent diffraction peaks of the &# 946; phase in the WAXS and XRD profiles. Such diffraction features indicate rapid formation of composition fluctuations in the &# 946; phase grains on the nanoscale, which was confirmed by atom probe tomography (APT) showing alternating Li- and Mg-rich zones within these grains. Such structural features are also characteristic of an alloy undergoing spinodal decomposition. Moreover, the broadening of the peaks in the diffraction profiles indicated that significant micro-strains are generated within the &# 946; phase after quenching. This peak broadening is likely to originate from significant coherency strains generated between the Li- and Mg-rich zones that formed on quenching. The in-situ WAXS ageing studies over a range of temperatures showed that these sidebands gradually disappeared, which was most pronounced at the highest temperature (220 °C). Regardless of ageing temperature, there was a linear correlation between hardness and peak width of &# 946;(110) in the WAXS profiles, which implies a one-to-one correspondence between the degree of <b>micro-straining</b> and mechanical properties (hardness). It was also demonstrated that the formation of these Li- and Mg-rich zones and their rapid coarsening during ageing is not the only factor controlling hardness. Rather, the micro-strains generated by these solute-rich zones were the dominant cause of quench-hardening and their release is the reason for subsequent age-softening...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Finite-element-models (FEM) are a {{promising}} technology to predict bone strength and fracture risk. Usually, the highest spatial resolution technically available is used, but this requires excessive computation time and memory in numerical simulations of large volumes. Thus, FEM were compared at decreasing resolutions {{with respect to}} local strain distribution and prediction of failure load to (1) validate MDCT-based FEM and to (2) optimize spatial resolution to save computation time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 20 cylindrical trabecular bone specimens (diameter 12 mm, length 15 - 20 mm) were harvested from elderly formalin-fixed human thoracic spines. All specimens were examined by micro-CT (isotropic resolution 30 μm) and whole-body multi-row-detector computed tomography (MDCT, 250 μm × 250 μm × 500 μm). The resolution of all datasets was lowered in eight steps to 2, 000 μm × 2000 μm × 500 μm and FEM were calculated at all resolutions. Failure load was determined by biomechanical testing. Probability density functions of local <b>micro-strains</b> were compared in all datasets and correlations between FEM-based and biomechanically measured failure loads were determined. RESULTS: The distribution of local <b>micro-strains</b> was similar for micro-CT and MDCT at comparable resolutions and showed a shift toward higher average values with decreasing resolution, corresponding to the increasing apparent trabecular thickness. Small <b>micro-strains</b> (εeff< 0. 005) could be calculated down to 250 μm × 250 μm × 500 μm. Biomechanically determined failure load showed significant correlations with all FEM, up to r= 0. 85 and did not significantly change with lower resolution but decreased with high thresholds, due to loss of trabecular connectivity.

Asphalt binders were recovered by extraction and distillation from asphalt mixtures premixed at different temperatures (140 ℃, 160 ℃, 180 ℃ for HMA, 100 ℃ and 120 ℃ for WMA) in the mixing plant. Penetration@ 25 ℃, softening point (R&B) and rotational Brookfield viscosity tests were carried out. Results show that the aging of asphalt binder increases as the mixing temperature is elevated, and remarkably accelerates at the temperatures higher than 150 ℃. Warm mix asphalt (for example, mixing temperature at 100 ℃or 120 ℃) can greatly reduce the aging of asphalt. Aging of the asphalt binder is one of the factors that would affect the mixture’s fatigue life. Four-point beam fatigue test samples were mixed and compacted at 140 ℃ for HMA and 120 ℃ for WMA, and fatigue tests with a frequency of 10 Hz and three constant strain levels (150 <b>micro-strain,</b> 300 <b>micro-strain,</b> 450 <b>micro-strain,</b> respectively) were performed. Results show that WMA’s fatigue life was higher than the control HMA, which indicates that it may reduce aging of asphalt binder and improve fatigue performance of asphalt mixture at lower production temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{research}} {{presented in this paper}} was to study the behavior of piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) under large strain and fatigue conditions. To test the characteristics of the PWAS under large strain conditions, the PWAS was bonded to an aircraft grade 2024 aluminum test specimen and subjected to tensile loading. The baseline impedance was recorded at zero strain and additional readings were recorded at 200 <b>micro-strain</b> intervals until failure of the PWAS occurred. Minimal changes occurred to the impedance signature until the value of 5000 <b>micro-strain</b> was exceeded. Eventually the PWAS failed in tension at approximately 7200 <b>micro-strain.</b> Theoretical data was developed to determine how the frequencies and resonance qualities change due to increased tensile loading to compare to the experimental data. For fatigue testing, the PWAS was again bonded to a 2024 aluminum test specimen and the specimen was loaded in fatigue. Appropriate mean loads and amplitudes were calculated to cause failure of the substrate at various values between 100 thousand and 10 million cycles. The baseline impedance reading was taken with the mean load applied {{at the beginning of the}} tests and at predetermined cyclic intervals. Small settle-in changes occurred in the impedance readings in the first 30 to 40 thousand cycles. Beyond this the PWAS readings were relatively unchanged until the metallic specimen finally broke under fatigue. The PWAS survived the fatigue failure of the metallic specimen...|$|R
30|$|This paper firstly and {{experimentally}} demonstrates an in-fiber axial <b>micro-strain</b> sensing head, {{combined with}} a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) based on the concentric multilayer elliptical-core fiber (CMECF). This MZI with a high extinction ratio (about 15 dB) is successfully achieved with a CMECF-single mode fiber-CMECF (CSC) structure. The MZI sensor theory and the resonance demodulation technology are systematically described in this paper. In this CSC structure, two sections of the CMECF have a role as the mode generator and coupler, respectively. LP 01 and LP 11 even, which have similar excitation coefficients, are two dominated propagating mode groups supported in the CMECF. On account of the distinct dual-mode property, a good stability of this sensor is realized. The detected resonance in the MZI shifts as the axial <b>micro-strain</b> variated due to {{the strong interaction between}} higher order modes. High sensitivity of ∼ 1.78 pm/με is experimentally achieved within the range of 0 με– 1250 με, meanwhile, the intensity fluctuation is below 0.38 dB.|$|R

It {{is available from}} [URL] Doi: 10. 4028 /www. scientificnet/MSF. 652. 25 Metadata only entryThe residual strain field around the scratches of 125 µm depth and 5 µm root radius have been measured from the Synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Scratches were produced using different tools in fine-grained aluminium alloy AA 5091. Residual stresses up to + 1700 <b>micro-strains</b> were measured at the scratch tip for one tool but remained up to only + 1000 <b>micro-strains</b> for the other tool scratch. The load-displacement curves obtained from nanoindentation {{were used to determine}} the residual stresses around the scratches. It was found that the load-displacement curves are sensitive to any local residual stress field present and behave according to the type of residual stresses. This combination of nanoindentation and synchrotron X-rays has been proved highly effective for the study of small-scale residual stresses around the features such as scratches...|$|R
40|$|The {{thermally}} activated {{process of}} Paidar-Pope-Vitek (PPV) lock {{formation in the}} L 1 2 intermetallic Ni 3 Al is simulated using the "nudged elastic band" method with an embedded atom potential. It is found that the one-step PPV lock is intrinsically unstable, {{but it can be}} stabilized by a large enough Escaig stress. The two-step PPV lock can be formed with a low activation energy when the one-step lock is involved as an intermediate step. In this case, the overall activation energy is about 1 eV, in reasonable agreement with the range of 0. 5 - 0. 9 eV expected from experimental observation of the flow stress anomaly in Ni 3 Al. High Escaig stresses are required to stabilize the one-step lock, and the absence of such high stresses in the <b>micro-strain</b> regime is thought to be the underlying reason for the absence of the flow stress anomaly in <b>micro-strain</b> conditions. © 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|Superconducting powders {{composed}} of 50 : 50 mixtures of yttrium and various rare-earth elements {{were analyzed by}} Rietveld analysis of x-ray diffraction data and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Crystallite size and <b>micro-strain</b> information obtained from the Rietveld analysis indicated that for mixtures containing Yb, Tm, and Er, crystallite sizes were significantly larger than for those containing larger rare-earths. <b>Micro-strain</b> minima were seen for the pure YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x control sample, as well as Y 0. 5 Eu 0. 5 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x and Y 0. 5 Nd 0. 5 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x. The minimum for the control sample {{is due to the}} lack of Y-R mixing on the Y-site. The minima observed for the Eu and Nd-containing samples are explained by cation exchange between the Y-R and Ba-sites. Magnetic susceptibility hysteresis loops indicate that the Eu-containing sample exhibits better magnetic flux-pinning properties than the YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x control sample...|$|R
