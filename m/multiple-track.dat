5000|$|In the Reading Eagle {{newspaper}} of December 5, 1982, Mark S. Wisnjewski reviewed Radio Romance. He stated [...] "One {{of my personal}} favorites for describing a situation that involves a bit of sleight-of-hand or illusionary doctoring is [...] "It's all done with mirrors." [...] I'd use that phrase to describe Eddie Rabbitt's [...] "Radio Romance." [...] It has more [...] "mirror" [...] tricks than a fun house. Take the packaging, or, as my drooling sister-in-law calls it, [...] "gift wrapping." [...] Rabbitt's looks have quite a bit {{to do with his}} popularity with the womenfolk. Of what value are leather duds, a tall, slender bod, blue eyes and curly black hair and beard? Rabbitt's appearance complements the provocative mood of his compositions. Rabbitt was a successful songwriter years before he [...] "hit" [...] as a singer and a close listen to the 10 tracks on [...] "Radio Romance" [...] reveals a few of the tricks he used to make the transition. As a songwriter/performer, Rabbitt has nicely mastered the [...] "hook." [...] At least eight of the 10 tunes on his new LP sound like 45 releases - they are that commercially [...] "catchy." [...] "You Can't Run from Love" [...] and [...] "You Got Me Now" [...] are probably the most likely contenders for Top 40 airplay. Perhaps the most amazing [...] "slight-of-ear" [...] on [...] "Radio Romance" [...] is Rabbitt's ability to take his major weakness and disguise it as a strength. Strip away the <b>multiple-tracking,</b> the echo and the harmonizing female voices, and one discovers Rabbitt has a surprisingly nondescript limited vocal range (exhibit A: the strained, Travolta-like high notes on [...] "Years After You"). To this electronic fortification, the singer has added an impressive collection of enunciation or word-stress novelties. Notice the clipped vowel sounds in the to/do/you's of [...] "Good Night for Falling in Love" [...] (among others). Listen to the offbeat inflection of the title line from [...] "You Can't Run from Love." [...] Spend an evening counting how many times Rabbitt puckers-out his hallmark non-verbal mating cry, [...] "oooo," [...] {{during the course of the}} LP. By surrounding these studio-enhanced vocals with ever-present heavy percussion and crisp orchestration, Rabbitt minimizes his shortcomings while producing mainstream pop-rockers. Understandably, his ballads are less effectively doctored. You can't help but wonder how long Rabbitt can continue to sing in Echo Cavern. For now, [...] "Radio Romance" [...] will keep his fans happy as long as they don't try to peek at the voice behind the curtain." ...|$|R

We know that a program must be correct and we can study it from that viewpoint only; we also know that it should be efficient and we can study its efficiency on another day, so to speak. In another mood we may ask ourselves whether, and if so: why, the program is desirable. But nothing is gained —on the contrary!— by tackling these various aspects simultaneously. It is what I sometimes have called [...] "the {{separation of}} concerns", which, even if not perfectly possible, is yet the only available technique for effective ordering of one's thoughts, that I know of. This is what I mean by [...] "focusing one's attention upon some aspect": it does not mean ignoring the other aspects, it is just doing justice to the fact that from this aspect's point of view, the other is irrelevant.

40|$|The primary {{aim of the}} {{magnetic}} recording industry is to increase storage capacities and transfer rates whilst maintaining or reducing costs. In <b>multiple-track</b> tape systems, as recorded track dimensions decrease, higher precision tape transport mechanisms and dedicated coding circuitry are required. This leads to increased manufacturing costs {{and a loss of}} flexibility. This thesis reports on the performance of a low precision low-cost <b>multiple-track</b> tape transport system. Software based techniques to study system performance, and to compensate for the mechanical deficiencies of this system were developed using occam and the transputer. The inherent parallelism of the <b>multiple-track</b> format was exploited by integrating a transputer into the recording channel to perform the signal processing tasks. An innovative model of the recording channel, written exclusively in occam, was developed. The effect of parameters, such as data rate, track dimensions and head misregistration on system performance was determined from the detailed error profile produced. This model may be run on a network of transputers, allowing its speed of execution to be scaled to suit the investigation. These features, combined with its modular flexibility makes it a powerful tool that may be applied to other <b>multiple-track</b> systems, such as digital HDTV. A greater understanding of the effects of mechanical deficiencies on the performance of <b>multiple-track</b> systems was gained from this study.

However, many MIMO communication systems operate in a more general context that may involve practical aspects that relate to implementation and account for impairments found in real-world systems. In this thesis, we study performance and implementation issues for MIMO detection in wireless communications systems. Our goal is to provide insight {{on the effects of}} some practical issues, including channel estimation errors, feedback delay, non-linear amplitude distortion, and carrier offset frequency, on the system performance of several MIMO transmission schemes. For trellis codes and intersymbol interference channels, generating function techniques are attractive in performance analysis since they provide the distance spectrum and a union bound on error probability. However, they can be computationally intensive when the code has large number of states. In view of this, we propose a dynamic state elimination ordering heuristic accelerate the computation. Lastly, we propose an efficient means to analytically evaluate the minimum distance for multiple-head <b>multiple-track</b> recording systems with intertrack interference (ITI). Our results reveal that for small-to-moderate ITI, single-track and two-track error events are the dominant factors in contributing to the minimum distance. We also utilize the generic nature of MIMO channels for the modelling of multiple-head <b>multiple-track</b> systems, and propose using an ordered successive interference cancellation algorithm as a favorable low-complexity alternative to the optimal maximum likelihood sequence detection...|$|E

These stations are all stopping points for the transit service and are principally used for the loading and unloading of goods and passengers. Some of these stations have <b>multiple-track</b> facilities for coach attachment and detachment. The MTT is generally considered as the economy train because of its cheaper fare charges, the number of coaches hauled and the seating capacity. The DMU, on the other hand, is considered as a first-class train because of the air-conditioned coaches, small number of coaches hauled and reduced seating capacity which make it more expensive.

40|$|In this paper, {{the train}} {{scheduling}} problem is modelled as a blocking parallel-machine job shop scheduling (BPMJSS) problem. In the model, trains, single-track sections and <b>multiple-track</b> sections, respectively, are synonymous with jobs, single machines and parallel machines, and an operation {{is regarded as}} the movement/traversal of a train across a section. Due to the lack of buffer space, the real-life case should consider blocking or hold-while-wait constraints, which means that a track section cannot release and must hold the train until next section on the routing becomes available. Based on literature review and our analysis, {{it is very hard to}} find a feasible complete schedule directly for BPMJSS problems. Firstly, a parallel-machine job-shop-scheduling (PMJSS) problem is solved by an improved shifting bottleneck procedure (SBP) algorithm without considering blocking conditions. Inspired by the proposed SBP algorithm, feasibility satisfaction procedure (FSP) algorithm is developed to solve and analyse the BPMJSS problem, by an alternative graph model that is an extension of the classical disjunctive graph models. The proposed algorithms have been implemented and validated using real-world data from Queensland Rail. Sensitivity analysis has been applied by considering train length, upgrading track sections, increasing train speed and changing bottleneck sections. The outcomes show that the proposed methodology would be a very useful tool for the real-life train scheduling problem...|$|E

The Convention is the culmination of <b>multiple-track</b> efforts that spread over many years with the objective of providing a binding instrument for the protection and promotion of cultural diversity at the international level.

40|$|In this paper, {{the dynamic}} {{performance}} {{of a certain kind}} of existing bridge under the action of high-speed railway traffic is addressed. Short-to-medium-span simply supported structures are susceptible to experiencing harmful transverse vibrations under resonant conditions, leading to excessive levels of vertical acceleration, the subsequent premature deconsolidation and degradation of the ballast layer, passenger discomfort and high maintenance costs of the corresponding lines. This dynamic problem, which can require the reduction of the design velocity or the temporary interruption of the railway service to undertake corrective actions, has been reported in Europe, China and Japan during the last decades (European Rail Research Institute (2000) [13], Duan (1995) [30], Ishibashi (2004) [15]). In particular, single-track simply supported short bridges appear to be quite critical structures in this regard. In what follows, the authors present an evaluation of the dynamic performance of three real bridges on the Spanish railway network, located in double-track branches but composed of structurally independent decks. The objective of the investigation is to compare their performance with that of hypothetical modified double-track versions of the original decks. An orthotropic plate finite element model, whose properties are updated from experimental tests performed on the bridges in the past, is used to predict the structural dynamic responses in the time domain. Finally, the predominant effect of the increase in the mass of the bridges over the increase in the eccentricity of the tracks, the reduction in the natural frequency experienced by the torsion mode, and the relevance of three-dimensional modal contributions is proven, leading to remarkable reductions of the maximum acceleration levels in the <b>multiple-track</b> modified structures. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{engineering}} provides {{solutions to}} wear and corrosion degradation of engineering components. Laser cladding is a surfacing process {{used to produce}} wear and corrosion resistant surfaces by covering a particular part of the substrate with another material that has superior properties, producing a fusion bond between the two materials with minimal dilution of the clad layer by the substrate. The advantages of laser cladding compared to conventional techniques include low and controllable heat input into the workpiece, a high cooling rate, great processing flexibility, low distortion due to the low heat input to the workpiece and minimal post-treatment. The main processing parameters of laser cladding include laser power, laser spot size, processing speed, and powder feed rate. Within an optimized operational window, all these variables have some effect on {{the temperature of the}} clad interaction zone. The laser cladding technique is very complicated because it involves metallurgical and physical phenomena, such as laser beam-materials interaction, heat transfer between the clad and the substrate, and the interdiffusion of the clad and the substrate materials. Laser cladding is currently an open-loop process, relying on the skills of the operator and requiring dedication to specialty to make it successful. Unless the required expertise is provided, attempts to make the process successful will be futile. The objective in conducting the project was to investigate and develop prototype sensors to monitor and control Nd:YAG laser cladding process. Through a LabVIEW software based monitoring program, real-time process monitoring of optical emissions in the form of light and heat radiation was carried out, and correlated with the properties of the produced clad layers. During various experiments, single- and <b>multiple-track</b> laser cladding trials were performed. The responses of such sensors to the selected conditions were examined and an in depth analysis of detected heat and optical radiation signals was carried out. The results of these experiments showed the ability of such sensors to recognize changes in process parameters, and detected defects on layer surfaces along with the presence of oxides. A multi-function closed-loop laser power and CNC motion table feed rate control interface based on a LabVIEW platform has been designed and built, which is capable of accepting and interpreting sensors' data and adjusting accordingly the laser power and CNC motion table feed rate to produce sound clad layers. The developed dual control strategy utilized in this study forms a relatively inexpensive and less-complicated system that allows end-users to achieve lower failure rates during laser cladding (within its own limitations) and, therefore, through successful concurrent control of melt pool temperature and motion table feed rate provide better productivity and quality in the experimentally produced clad layers...|$|E
40|$|In {{magnetic}} recording greater area) bit packing densities are achieved through increasing track density by reducing space between and {{width of the}} recording tracks, and/or reducing the wavelength of the recorded information. This leads to the requirement of higher precision tape transport mechanisms and dedicated coding circuitry. A TMS 320 10 digital signal processor is applied to a standard low-cost, low precision, <b>multiple-track,</b> compact cassette tape recording system. Advanced signal processing and coding techniques are employed to maximise recording density and {{to compensate for the}} mechanical deficiencies of this system. Parallel software encoding/decoding algorithms have been developed for several Run-Length Limited modulation codes. The results for a peak detection system show that Bi-Phase L code can be reliably employed up to a data rate of 5 kbits/second/track. Development of a second system employing a TMS 32025 and sampling detection permitted the utilisation of adaptive equalisation to slim the readback pulse. Application of conventional read equalisation techniques, that oppose inter-symbol interference, resulted in a 30 % increase in performance. Further investigation shows that greater linear recording densities can be achieved by employing Partial Response signalling and Maximum Likelihood Detection. Partial response signalling schemes use controlled inter-symbol interference to increase recording density at the expense of a multi-level read back waveform which results in an increased noise penalty. Maximum Likelihood Sequence detection employs soft decisions on the readback waveform to recover this loss. The associated modulation coding techniques required for optimised operation of such a system are discussed. Two-dimensional run-length-limited (d, ky) modulation codes provide a further means of increasing storage capacity in multi-track recording systems. For example the code rate of a single track run length-limited code with constraints (1, 3), such as Miller code, can be increased by over 25 % when using a 4 -track two-dimensional code with the same d constraint and with the k constraint satisfied across a number of parallel channels. The k constraint along an individual track, kx, can be increased without loss of clock synchronisation since the clocking information derived by frequent signal transitions can be sub-divided across a number of, y, parallel tracks in terms of a ky constraint. This permits more code words to be generated for a given (d, k) constraint in two dimensions than is possible in one dimension. This coding technique is furthered by development of a reverse enumeration scheme based on the trellis description of the (d, ky) constraints. The application of a two-dimensional code to a high linear density system employing extended class IV partial response signalling and maximum likelihood detection is proposed. Finally, additional coding constraints to improve spectral response and error performance are discussed. Hewlett Packard, Computer Peripherals Division (Bristol...|$|E
40|$|M̈odern {{signaling}} systems play a {{major role}} to provide safety net to prevent accidents due to human errors, and the management of railway operation to maximize the use of scarce resources and optimize the investment in infrastructure. With the technological evolution of the ERTMS-ETCS radio-based signaling system, that is envisaged on the new MoU signed beginning of 2012 by the major European railways stake-holders, satellite positioning technology will become a priority. In fact the GNSS technology matches primarily unmet demand for cost-efficient train control systems such those required on low traffic and regional lines and it matters as much as ever for drastically reducing the life cycle costs of the train signaling systems. The main challenge to face in the introduction of GNSS-based localization systems on the train signaling systems is to not impacting the high safety levels reached so far by the current systems which rely on reliable but costly odometry-based and wayside equipments to estimate the train position. Since the GNSS constellations are rapidly evolving towards a redundant and resilient global infrastructure we have developed a novel multi-constellation PVT algorithm for train localization determination, specifically designed to handle the case of multiple track scenarios. This solution is compatible with the ERTMS-ETCS train control system platform and compliant with the SIL- 4 safety requirements of CENELEC railways norms i. e., Tolerable Hazard Rate (THR), 10 E- 9 ? THR ? 10 E- 8. Railways applications are referred as safety-related systems, a sub case of the well known safety-of-life GNSS application and they requires a higher performance especially in terms of availability, continuity, integrity and accuracy. Conventional, stand-alone, GPS systems are unable to provide the positioning information with an error bounded by a protection level compliant with the safety requirements of railways applications. On the other hands, recent developments of GNSS prove to be inspiring for safety-of-life applications: for instance, modernized GNSS signals are broadcast with increased power and enhanced characteristics for multipath mitigation, while the presence of multiple constellations may potentially increase the overall availability along a rail line. To meet the SIL 4 Requirements, we adopted an architecture charactized by a dedicated integrity monitoring and augmentation network and by the use of multi-constellation receivers. More in detail, in our system, the train is equipped with the GNSS Location Determination System On-Board Unit (LDS OBU), which provides the PVT estimate to the existing localization system, and the Authorization To Proceed (ATP). Each GNSS LDS OBU is equipped with (i) two GNSS receivers, (ii) a local processor performing the PVT estimation starting from local measures, (iii) a track DataBase and the augmentation data received from a Track Area LDS Safety (TALS) server, and (iv) a communication module. The PVT algorithm estimates the train location by explicitly accounting {{for the fact that the}} train is constrained to lie on a railway track. Basically, exploiting this constraint allows to estimate train location even when only two satellites are in view. Effective reduction in the number of required satellites to make a fix, when track constraint is applied, depends on the track-satellite geometry. In essence, satellites aligned along the track give more information than those at the cross-over. Satellites in excess can then be employed either to increase accuracy or to increase integrity and availability. In [1] the authors presented a SIL- 4 solution for PVT train estimation, valid for single-track scenarios. However, <b>multiple-track</b> scenarios have to be faced to account for real situations and those cases are more challenging due to the fact that inter-track separation is rather smaller compared to the inter-train separation along the same track. As a matter of fact, the cross-track protection level (1. 5 m) is lower than the along track protection level (15 m) of one order of magnitude. In this paper, we address the problem of, PVT estimation in presence of multiple tracks. This can be formulated as a combination of hypothesis testing (i. e., which is the current track where the train lies on, or, better, which is the probability of a train lying on a given track?) and parameter estimation (i. e., given a track, which is the curvilinear abscissa of the train receiver?). Then, assuming that the train can be located along one of M tracks, and considering the k-th hypothesis as corresponding to the k-th track, proceeding as in [2], we first (i) •...|$|E
