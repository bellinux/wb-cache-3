5|$|Middleton {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} of raid and harrying. Although successful in distracting the Commonwealth forces and causing disruption, it soon began to prove counter-productive, as growing unpopularity led to a drying up of recruitment. With his return to Scotland after his brief naval command against the Dutch, Monck began a campaign against the rising, making forced marches of between 12 and 20 <b>miles</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> in difficult terrain. On 19 July 1654 a force from Monck's command under Thomas Morgan caught Middleton's army at Dalnaspidal. In the resulting battle the royalists were scattered and a wounded Middleton was forced to escape to the Highlands. The end of the Dutch War meant there was no possibility of foreign aid and government reinforcements were now available to combat the rising. As a result, the Royalist military effort petered out. Eventually, Glencairn surrendered to Monck and Middleton escaped to the continent to join the court in exile.|$|E

25|$|Mobility and training. Shaka {{discarded}} sandals {{to enable}} his warriors to run faster. Initially {{the move was}} unpopular, but those who objected were simply killed, a practice that quickly concentrated the minds of available personnel. Shaka drilled his troops frequently, implementing forced marches that could cover more than fifty <b>miles</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> He also drilled the troops to carry out encirclement tactics (see below). Such mobility gave the Zulu a significant impact in their local region and beyond.|$|E

25|$|On March 21, 1965, a Sunday, {{approximately}} 3,200 marchers {{departed for}} Montgomery. Marching {{in the front}} row with King were Rev. Ralph Abernathy, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, Greek Orthodox Father Iakovos (later Archbishop Iakovos of America), and Roman Catholic nuns. They walked approximately 12 <b>miles</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> and slept in nearby fields. The federal government provided protection by National Guard and military troops. Thousands of people joined the march along the way. By the time the marchers reached the capitol four days later, on March 25, their strength had swelled to around 25,000 people. Their moral campaign had attracted thousands of people from across the country.|$|E
25|$|New {{troops from}} the British Empire (specifically Australia, New Zealand, India, and South Africa) led to the {{resumption}} of operations in August 1918. Following an extended series of deceptive moves, the Ottoman line was broken at the Battle of Megiddo (19–21 September 1918), and the Allied cavalry passed through and blocked the Turkish retreat. The EEF then advanced at an impressive rate, as high as 60 miles in 55 hours for cavalry, and infantry slogging 20 <b>miles</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> and encountering minimal resistance. Damascus fell on 1 October, Homs on 16 October, and Aleppo on 25 October. With the threat of Asia Minor being invaded, the Ottoman Empire capitulated on 30 October 1918 with {{the signing of the}} Armistice of Mudros.|$|E

25|$|In {{tropical}} climates they effectively out-compete European bees and, {{at their}} peak rate of expansion, they spread north {{at a rate of}} almost two kilometers (about one <b>mile)</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> There were discussions about slowing the spread by placing large numbers of docile European-strain hives in strategic locations, particularly at the Isthmus of Panama, but various national and international agricultural departments were unable to prevent the bees' expansion. Current knowledge of the genetics of these bees suggests that such a strategy, had it been attempted, would not have been successful.|$|R

At the end of a week, though he had succeeded in moving his eight hundred pounds forward <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> he had lost fifteen pounds of his own weight. His face was lean and haggard. All {{resilience}} had gone out of his body and mind. He no longer walked, but plodded.

25|$|The {{arrival of}} the King and his {{bodyguard}} ended the preliminary stage and the army would {{move on to the}} target of their campaign. The army would march in good order; in the vanguard came the standard of the Gods, signifying the servitude of the Assyrian Kings to their primary God Assur. Following this was the King, the humble servant of Assur surrounded by his bodyguard {{with the support of the}} main chariot divisions and cavalry, the elite of the army. In the rear was the infantry; the Assyrian troops followed by the conquered peoples. Following this would be the siege train, supply wagons and then the camp followers. Such a formation would have been very vulnerable to a rear attack. Some columns of troops could travel 30 <b>miles</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> and such speed would have been used to surprise and frighten an opponent into submission.|$|E
25|$|To {{make matters}} worse, Warren, a Liberal, {{did not get}} along with Conservative Home Secretary Henry Matthews, {{appointed}} {{a few months after}} he became Commissioner. Matthews supported the desire of the Assistant Commissioner (Crime), James Monro, to remain effectively independent of the Commissioner and also supported the Receiver, the force's chief financial officer, who continually clashed with Warren. Home Office Permanent Secretary Godfrey Lushington did not get on with Warren either. Warren was pilloried in the press for his extravagant dress uniform, his concern for the quality of his men's boots (a sensible concern considering they walked up to 20 <b>miles</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> but one which was derided as a military obsession with kit), and his reintroduction of drill. The radical press completely turned against him after Bloody Sunday on 13 November 1887, when a demonstration in Trafalgar Square was broken up by 4,000 police officers on foot, 300 infantrymen and 600 mounted police and Life Guards.|$|E
25|$|Custer and his force {{entered the}} Black Hills from the north, {{travelling}} south {{at a slow}} pace {{of no more than}} four or five <b>miles</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> on some occasions. On July 31, 1874, the wagon train reached Harney Peak (now Black Elk Peak), and Custer together with Ludlow took three or four men to climb it. In the mean time, the rest of the expedition made camp at the mountain's base at the newly named Custer Park. While the majority of the force remained there, Custer took a small unit with him to locate a suitable site for a new fort. By August 2, 1874 this force had reached a point eight and a half miles south-east of the mountain, to a location they named Agnes Park, having had a number of peaceful encounters with Native American settlements. On August 7 Custer shot and killed a grizzly bear, forever claiming this to be his greatest achievement as a hunter.|$|E

50|$|Long-distance riding is the pastime {{of riding}} {{motorcycles}} over long distances.

25|$|He was {{not above}} medium height, {{somewhat}} slight of figure and seemingly frail in physique, though this frailty was in appearance only {{as he was}} a man of tremendous, tireless energy. Although in no sense athletic, he made some sort of exercise in the open air each day almost a religious duty. At one time this took the form of bicycle rides, though he soon gave these up in favor of walking. His rule was to cover at least four <b>miles</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> rain or shine, and there was no part of the less congested portions of New Haven and its environs over which he had not many times traveled as he walked unhurriedly alone, stooping somewhat, buried in thought, compelled by poor eyesight to keep his gaze fixed upon his path a few feet ahead of him. This methodical exercise he kept up until, in his last years, injuries received as the result of a fall confined him to his home.|$|E
25|$|The Russian forces {{advanced}} rapidly {{at a rate}} of 20 miles a day; shocking many {{commanders and}} foreign observers who were expecting a repeat of the Western snail paced advance. After the capture of Grodno in Belarus on July 19, Tukhachevski ordered that Warsaw be taken by August 12. When Brest-Litovsk fell on August 1 and the Narew and Bug River were crossed by the Red Army, Soviet forces faced no natural barriers between them and the Vistula River on which Warsaw was situated. Polish attempt to defend the Bug River line with 4th Army and Grupa Poleska units stopped the advance of the Red Army for only one week. The Red Army advance slowed down – but only to 12 <b>miles</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Units of the Russian Northwest Front, after taking Łomża and Ostrołęka (by Gej-Chan) and crossing the Narew River on August 2, approached the 60 miles radius from Warsaw. Fortress of Brześć which was to be the headquarters of Polish planned counteroffensive fell to the 16th Army in the first attack. The Russian Southwest Front had pushed Polish forces out of Ukraine and was advancing on Zamość and Lwów, the metropolis of southeastern Poland and an important industrial center, defended by the Polish 6th Army. Polish Galicia's Lwów (Ukrainian Lviv) was besieged, and five Russian armies were approaching Warsaw.|$|E
500|$|The {{speed of}} travel varied greatly.
