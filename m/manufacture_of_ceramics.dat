50|$|Bauxite tailings, bauxite residue or alumina {{refinery}} residues (ARR) is a by-product {{in the production}} of alumina (aluminium oxide). Alumina is the principal raw material used in the manufacture of aluminium metal and also widely used in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>ceramics,</b> abrasives and refractories. The scale of production makes the waste product an important one, and issues with its storage are reviewed and every opportunity is explored to find uses for it. Over 95% of the alumina produced globally is through the Bayer process; for every tonne of alumina produced, approximately 1 to 1.5 tonnes of bauxite tailings/residue are also produced. Annual production of alumina in 2015 was approximately 115 million tonnes resulting in the generation of about 150 million tonnes of bauxite tailings/residue.|$|E
50|$|The {{last part}} of the 19th century saw many {{technological}} innovation in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>ceramics,</b> particularly the development of high temperature (grand feu) porcelain with crystallised and matte glazes. At the same time, several lost techniques, such as oxblood glaze, were rediscovered. Art Nouveau ceramics were also influenced by traditional and modern Japanese and Chinese ceramics, whose vegetal and floral motifs fitted well with the Art Nouveau style. In France, artists also rediscovered the traditional grés methods and reinvented them with new motifs. Ceramics also found an important new use in architecture: Art Nouveau architects, Jules Lavirotte and Hector Guimard among them, began to decorate the façades of buildings with ceramic tiles, many of them made by the firm of Alexandre Bigot, giving them a distinct Art Nouveau sculptural look. In the Art Nouveau ceramics quickly moved into the domain of sculpture and architecture.|$|E

5000|$|Awaji ware {{was founded}} in the early 1830s by Minpei Kashu (1796-1871) [...] (last name also spelled Mimpei) from Iga village. Coming from a wealthy trading family, he was a scholar of {{classical}} literature and skillful {{in the art of}} chanoyu. He became concerned about the development of industrial resources in his province and devoted himself to the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>ceramics,</b> which he had studied under Ogata Shuhei (1788-1839), a famous Kyoto potter. Returning to his village after his studies, he established kilns in the fifth year of Tenpō (1835/1836) and devoted his whole fortune to his enterprises. Some sources give an earlier founding year of 1831. Lord Hachisuka of Awaji Province subsequently subsidized Minpei's manufactory and appointed him head of the workshops. Thus his efforts were successful, and his manufactory reached a prosperity such that its production equaled in value the rice harvest of the eleven surrounding villages. After Minpei's death in the second year of Bunkyū (1862) his successors continued manufacturing ceramics, which became a source of wealth for the province.|$|E
50|$|The {{material}} of {{choice of a}} given era is often a defining point. Phrases such as Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Steel Age are great examples. Originally deriving from the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>ceramics</b> and its putative derivative metallurgy, materials science {{is one of the}} oldest forms of engineering and applied science. Modern materials science evolved directly from metallurgy, which itself evolved from mining and (likely) ceramics and the use of fire. A major breakthrough in the understanding of materials occurred in the late 19th century, when the American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs demonstrated that the thermodynamic properties related to atomic structure in various phases are related to the physical properties of a material. Important elements of modern materials science are a product of the space race: the understanding and engineering of the metallic alloys, and silica and carbon materials, used in building space vehicles enabling the exploration of space. Materials science has driven, and been driven by, the development of revolutionary technologies such as rubbers, plastics, semiconductors, and biomaterials.|$|E

A more durable pottery works was founded in 1801. In 1840, when it was joined with Montereau, it was employing 900 workers. As at Montereau a series of British-born directors and proprietors shaped the manufactory during the 19th century.Jacques Bagnall was born in 1762 at Burslem {{in the heart of the}} Staffordshire Potteries; in 1784 he was in France, working as a modeller in the manufactory of [...] "English stoneware" [...] (grès anglais) at Douai. For a time he directed the manufactory of porcelain at Chantilly for its owner, Christopher Potter, before taking on the direction of the pottery at Creil in 1802. As director of design at Creil he was responsible for a splendid body of work, sometimes copying the [...] neoclassical styles of Wedgwood and other fashionable English makers. A table service of black stoneware (grès noir) like the black jasperware of Wedgwood can be seen at the museum at Creil. [...] Bagnall died ar Creil in 1825. From 1811 the director of the pottery at Creil wasCharles Gaspard Alexandre Saint-Cricq Casaux; in 1819 he purchased the works at Montereau, and fused the two in 1840 as Creil-Montereau. The following year Louis-Martin Lebeuf (1792-1854) and Jean Baptiste Gratien Milliet (1797-1875) purchased the amalgamated works. Two Englishmen, George Vernon, father and son, served as director and assistant director until 1849: they introduced the manufacture of soft-paste porcelain. The Vernons' successor, Henry Félix Anatole Barluet (born in 1802 at l'Aigle, Orne) was a local man, whose mother was a Lebeuf. (Louis Lebeuf and his son were both directors of the works at Montereau; Adrien Lebeuf de Montgermont, was the town's mayor.) As the major employers at Creil, From 1866 Barluet oversaw the development of the worker city of Saint-Médard to house his employees. He served as mayor of Creil until his death. Under his regime, the transfer-printed decors of Creil-Montereau took new directions.|$|E
