50|$|Triparental mating {{is a form}} of Bacterial {{conjugation}} where a conjugative plasmid {{present in}} one bacterial strain assists the transfer of a <b>mobilizable</b> <b>plasmid</b> present in a second bacterial strain into a third bacterial strain. Plasmids are introduced into bacteria for such purposes as transformation, cloning, or transposon mutagenesis. Triparental matings can help overcome some of the barriers to efficient plasmid mobilization. For instance, if the conjugative plasmid and the <b>mobilizable</b> <b>plasmid</b> are members of the same incompatibility group they do not need to stably coexist in the second bacterial strain for the <b>mobilizable</b> <b>plasmid</b> to be transferred.|$|E

We have analyzed quantitatively horizontal gene transfer from Escherichia coli to Actinomycetes. The efficiencies of DNA transfer of four different systems were compared that consist of conjugative and <b>mobilizable</b> <b>plasmids</b> with a broad-host range. Three novel binary vector set-ups were constructed based on: (i) the IncQ group of <b>mobilizable</b> <b>plasmids</b> (RSF 1010), (ii) IncQ-like pTF-FC 2 and (iii) pSB 102 that belongs to a new class of broad-host-range plasmids. The established system based on the IncPα group of conjugative plasmids served as the reference. For all plasmids constructed, we confirmed the functional integrity of the selected transfer machineries by intrageneric matings between E. coli strains. We demonstrate that the transfer systems introduced in this study are efficient in mediating gene transfer from E. coli to Actinomycetes and are possible alternatives for gene transfer into Actinomycetes for which the IncPα-based transfer system is not applicable. The use of plasmids that integrate into the recipients’ chromosomes compared to that of plasmids replicating autonomously is shown to allow the access to a wider range of hosts...|$|R
40|$|Self-transmissible and <b>mobilizable</b> <b>plasmids</b> {{contribute}} to the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria by enabling the horizontal transfer of acquired antibiotic resistance. The objective {{of this study was}} to capture and characterize self-transmissible and <b>mobilizable</b> resistance <b>plasmids</b> from a coastal wetland impacted by urban stormwater runoff and human wastewater during the rainy season. Four plasmids were captured, two self-transmissible and two mobilizable, using both mating and enrichment approaches. Plasmid genomes, sequenced with either Illumina or PacBio platforms, revealed representatives of incompatibility groups IncP- 6, IncR, IncN 3, and IncF. The plasmids ranged in size from 36 to 144 kb and encoded known resistance genes for most of the major classes of antibiotics used to treat Gram-negative infections (tetracyclines, sulfonamides, β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and amphenicols). The <b>mobilizable</b> IncP- 6 <b>plasmid</b> pLNU- 11 was discovered in a strain of Citrobacter freundii enriched from the wetland sediments with tetracycline and nalidixic acid, and encodes a novel AmpC-like β-lactamase (blaWDC- 1), which shares less than 62 % amino acid sequence identity with the PDC class of β-lactamases found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although the IncR plasmid pTRE- 1611 was captured by mating wetland bacteria with P. putida KT 2440 as recipient, it was found to be mobilizable rather than self-transmissible. Two self-transmissible multidrug-resistance plasmids were also captured: the small (48 kb) IncN 3 plasmid pTRE- 131 was captured by mating wetland bacteria with Escherichia coli HY 842 where it is seemed to be maintained at nearly 240 copies per cell, while the large (144 kb) IncF plasmid pTRE- 2011, which was isolated from a cefotaxime-resistant environmental strain of E. coli ST 744, exists at just a single copy per cell. Furthermore, pTRE- 2011 bears the globally epidemic blaCTX-M- 55 extended-spectrum β-lactamase downstream of ISEcp 1.

40|$|Mechanisms for the {{possible}} transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes between staphylococci and enterococci remain poorly defined. We have previously reported the transfer between Enterococcus faecalis strains of a multiresistance chromosomal element (beta-lactamase positive {{and resistance to}} erythromycin, gentamicin, mercuric chloride, streptomycin, and tetracycline) which we have tentatively designated Tn 5385. Tn 5385 is a composite of several smaller transposable elements, including Tn 5384, a 26 -kb composite transposon conferring resistance to erythromycin, gentamicin, and mercuric chloride. Analyses of 7 kb within Tn 5384 and flanking sequences within the larger element revealed sequences characteristic of staphylococcal beta-lactamase and small, <b>mobilizable</b> <b>plasmids</b> flanking a region with a sequence identical {{to those of the}} replication genes previously described for enterococcal and streptococcal broad-host-range plasmids. These diverse regions are linked by insertion sequences IS 256 and IS 257 in a manner which suggests a series of cointegration events as the genesis of the current relationship. Taken together, these data suggest that Tn 5384 and the larger element within which it is incorporated (Tn 5385) evolved at least in part as a result of cointegration between an enterococcal broad-host-range plasmid and staphylococcal beta-lactamase and small <b>mobilizable</b> <b>plasmids.</b> These results implicate broad-host-range plasmids in the transfer of resistance determinants from staphylococci to enterococci...|$|R

40|$|It is {{currently}} believed that {{interaction between the}} relaxosome of a <b>mobilizable</b> <b>plasmid</b> and the transfer machinery of the helper conjugative plasmid is mediated by a TraG family coupling protein. The coupling proteins appear as an essential determinant of mobilization specificity and efficiency. Using a two-hybrid system, we demonstrated {{for the first time}} the direct in vivo interaction between the coupling protein of a conjugative plasmid (the TraG protein of RP 4) and the relaxase of a <b>mobilizable</b> <b>plasmid</b> (the Mob protein of pBHR 1, a derivative of the broad host range plasmid pBBR 1). This interaction was confirmed in vitro by an overlay assay and was shown to occur even in the absence of the transfer origin of pBHR 1. We showed that, among 11 conjugative plasmids tested, pBHR 1 is efficiently mobilized only by plasmids encoding an IncP-type transfer system. We also showed that the RP 4 TraG coupling protein is essential for mobilization of a pBBR 1 derivative and is the element that allows its mobilization by R 388 plasmid (IncW) at a detectable frequency.

40|$|Mobile genetic {{elements}} (MGE) such as phages, plasmids and transposons play {{a crucial}} role in bacterial adaptation and evolution. These MGE mobilize and reorganize genes within a given genome or between bacterial cells. The impact of space flight conditions on these processes is largely unknown. The Mobilisatsia/Plasmida experiment was set up to investigate the impact of space flight conditions on plasmid-mediated conjugation. The experiment was done aboard the International Space Station during the Soyuz Mission 8 S (April 19 (th) until April 30 (th) 2004). An experiment was performed with the Gram-positive Bacillus thuringiensis AND 931 (carrying the conjugative plasmid pXO 16), B. thuringiensis 4 Q 7 (with <b>mobilizable</b> <b>plasmid</b> pC 194) and B. thuringiensis GBJ 002 (final recipient). A second experiment was carried out with the Gram-negative Escherichia coli CM 140 (carrying the conjugative plasmid RP 4), E. coli CM 1962 (with the <b>mobilizable</b> <b>plasmid</b> pMOL 222) and Cupriavidus metallidurans AE 815 (final recipient). It was observed by selective platings that plasmid exchange between the Gram-positive bacterial strains occurred in the space flight experiment. It is speculated that the latter plasmid exchange occurs more efficient than in the ground control experiment. No significant differences could be observed between space flight and ground control for the Gram-negative bacteria. The data indicate that plasmid exchange between microorganisms is occurring under space flight conditions.

Heteroplasmic ftsZ mutants occurred mostly as cell aggregations, lacking the regularity of successive division planes.

Here we combine analysis of natural infection dynamics, population genomics and molecular genetics to ask (i) to what extent oysters are passively colonized by Vibrio population present in the surrounding water, (ii) how populations turn over during pathogenicity events and (iii) what genetic factors are responsible for pathogenicity. We identified several populations of Vibrio preferentially associated with oyster tissues. Among these, Vibrio crassostreae is particularly abundant in diseased animals while nearly absent in the surrounding water, and its pathogenicity is correlated {{with the presence of}} a large <b>mobilizable</b> <b>plasmid.</b> We further demonstrate that the plasmid is essential for killing but not necessary for survival in tissues of oysters.

Antoine and C. Locht, Mol. Microbiol. 6 : 1785 - 1799, 1992). Plasmid pBBR 1 consists of two functional cassettes and presents sequence similarities with the transfer origins of several <b>plasmids</b> and <b>mobilizable</b> transposons from gram-positive bacteria. We show that the Mob protein specifically recognizes a 52 -bp sequence which contains, {{in addition to the}} transfer origin, the promoter of the mob gene. We demonstrate that this gene is autoregulated. The binding of the Mob protein to the 52 -bp sequence could thus allow the formation of a protein-DNA complex with a double function: relaxosome formation and mob gene regulation. We show that the Mob protein is a relaxase, and we located the nic site position in vitro. After sequence alignment, the position of the nic site of pBBR 1 corresponds with those of the nick sites of the Bacteroides mobilizable transposon Tn 4555 and the streptococcal plasmid pMV 158. The oriT of the latter is characteristic of a family of <b>mobilizable</b> <b>plasmids</b> that are found in gram-positive bacteria and that replicate by the rolling-circle mechanism. Plasmid pBBR 1 thus appears to be a new member of this group, even though it resides in gram-negative bacteria and does not replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism.

40|$|International audienceConjugation {{is a key}} {{mechanism}} of bacterial evolution that involves mobile genetic elements. Recent findings indicated that the main actors of conjugative transfer are not the well-known conjugative or <b>mobilizable</b> <b>plasmids</b> but are the integrated elements. This paper reviews current knowledge on integrative and mobilizable elements (IMEs) that have recently {{been shown to be}} highly diverse and highly widespread but are still rarely described. IMEs encode their own excision and integration and use the conjugation machinery of unrelated co-resident conjugative element for their own transfer. Recent studies revealed a much more complex and much more diverse lifecycle than initially thought. Besides their main transmission as integrated elements, IMEs probably use plasmid-like strategies to ensure their maintenance after excision. Their interaction with conjugative elements reveals not only harmless hitchhikers but also hunters that use conjugative elements as target for their integration or harmful parasites that subvert the conjugative apparatus of incoming elements to invade cells that harbor them. IMEs carry genes conferring various functions, such as resistance to antibiotics, that can enhance the fitness of their hosts and that contribute to their maintenance in bacterial populations.

At. caldus {{is a member}} of a consortium of bacteria (along with Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Leptospirilum ferrooxidans) that is used industrially for decomposing metal sulphide ores and concentrates at temperatures of 40 ºC or below which is now a well-established industrial process to recover metals from certain copper, uranium and gold-bearing minerals or mineral concentrates. These biomining microbes are usually obligately acidophilic, autotrophic, usually aerobic iron- or sulphur-oxidizing chemolithotrophic bacteria. Their remarkable physiology allows them to inhabit an ecological niche that is largely inorganic and differs from those environments populated by the more commonly studied non-acidophilic heterotrophic bacteria. At. caldus, is a moderately thermophilic (45 to 50 ºC), highly acidophilic (pH 1. 5 to 2. 5) sulphur-oxidizing bacterium, and its role as one of the major players in the industrial decomposition of metal sulphide ores has become evident in recent years. At. caldus f from which pTC-F 14 was isolated was found to be one of two dominant organisms in a bacterial consortium undergoing pilot-scale testing for the commercial extraction of nickel from ores...|$|E
40|$|Bacteria {{display a}} variety of {{mechanisms}} to control plasmid conjugation. Among them, fertility inhibition (FI) systems prevent conjugation of co-resident plasmids within donor cells. Analysis of the mechanisms of inhibition between conjugative plasmids could provide new alternatives to fight antibiotic resistance dissemination. In this work, inhibition of conjugation of broad host range IncW plasmids was analyzed {{in the presence of}} a set of co-resident plasmids. Strong FI systems against plasmid R 388 conjugation were found in IncF/MOBF 12 as well as in IncI/MOBP 12 plasmids, represented by plasmids F and R 64, respectively. In both cases, the responsible gene was pifC, known also to be involved in FI of IncP plasmids and Agrobacterium T-DNA transfer to plant cells. It was also discovered that the R 388 gene osa, which affects T-DNA transfer, also prevented conjugation of IncP- 1 /MOBP 11 plasmids represented by plasmids RP 4 and R 751. Conjugation experiments of different <b>mobilizable</b> <b>plasmids,</b> helped by either FI-susceptible or FI-resistant transfer systems, demonstrated that the conjugative component affected by both PifC and Osa was the type IV conjugative coupling protein. In addition, in silico analysis of FI proteins suggests that they represent recent acquisitions of conjugative plasmids, i. e., are not shared by members of the same plasmid species. This implies that FI are rapidly-moving accessory genes, possibly acting on evolutionary fights between plasmids for the colonization of specific hosts...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial type IV {{secretion}} system (T 4 SS) {{belongs to}} a growing class of evolutionarily conserved transporters that translocate DNA and proteins into {{a wide variety of}} organisms including bacterial and eukaryotic cells. Archetypal is the Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB/D 4 T 4 SS that transfers oncogenic T-DNA to various eukaryotic cells, which is transferred as a nucleoprotein T-complex with VirD 2 as the pilot protein. As a derivative of plasmid conjugation systems, the VirB/D 4 T 4 SS can also transfer certain <b>mobilizable</b> <b>plasmids</b> and bacterial proteins like VirE 2 and VirF, although it is unknown how the membrane-bound T 4 SS recruits different transfer substrates. Here, we show that a cytoplasmic VirD 2 -binding protein (VBP) is involved in the recruitment of the T-complex to the energizing components of the T 4 SS, including VirD 4, VirB 4, and VirB 11. VBP is also important for the recruitment of a conjugative plasmid to a different transfer system independent of VirB/D 4. These data indicate that VBP functions as a previously unrecognized recruiting protein that helps couple nucleoprotein substrates to the appropriate transport sites for conjugative DNA transfers. VBP has three functionally redundant homologs, and similar homologs can be found in different bacterial genomes, suggesting a previously uncharacterized class of proteins involved in conjugative DNA transfers...|$|R
40|$|Derivatives of nonconjugal {{plasmids}} {{that carry}} Tn 4399, a transposon isolated from Bacteroides fragilis, can be mobilized for transfer by the broad-host-range IncP plasmids pRK 231 or R 751 in Escherichia coli. To characterize regions of Tn 4399 involved in mobilization, we have isolated and analyzed subcloned fragments of Tn 4399 in E. coli, {{as well as}} mutations within the element. We have identified a "mobilization cassette" within a 2. 8 -kb region of Tn 4399 which, when cloned into mobilization-deficient plasmids, allows these plasmids to be mobilized in trans by the IncP plasmids pRK 231 and R 751. The 2. 8 -kb region has been sequenced, and several open reading frames have been identified. Mutants defective in two genes, designated mocA and mocB, coding for deduced products of 36. 4 and 16. 4 kDa, respectively, cannot be mobilized by either IncP plasmid; these mutants can be complemented {{in the presence of}} the respective wild-type genes in trans. This suggests that the putative MocA and MocB proteins have a role in the mobilization process. The 36. 4 -kDa MocA protein contains a 14 -amino-acid sequence which is closely related to a highly conserved motif within DNA relaxases encoded by a wide variety of conjugal or <b>mobilizable</b> <b>plasmids.</b> Subcloning experiments also lead to the localization of an oriT region within a 199 -bp fragment, internal to the mobilization cassette...|$|R
