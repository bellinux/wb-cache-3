60|$|Among the {{subjects}} of which she treated, was a tale of Moslem honor, and old-fashioned Spanish courtesy, which made a strong impression on me. She disclaimed all <b>merit</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention,</b> however, and said she had merely dilated into verse a popular tradition; and, indeed, I have since found the main facts inserted {{at the end of}} Conde's History of the Domination of the Arabs, and the story itself embodied {{in the form of an}} episode in the Diana of Montemayor. From these sources I have drawn it forth, and endeavored to shape it according to my recollection of the version of the beautiful minstrel; but, alas! what can supply the want of that voice, that look, that form, that action, which gave magical effect to her chant, and held every one rapt in breathless admiration! Should this mere travestie of her inspired numbers ever meet her eye, in her stately abode at Granada, may it meet with that indulgence which belongs to her benignant nature. Happy should I be, if it could awaken in her bosom one kind recollection of the lonely stranger and sojourner, for whose gratification she did not think it beneath her to exert those fascinating powers which were the delight of brilliant circles; and who will ever recall with enthusiasm the happy evening passed in listening to her strains, in the moon-lit halls of the Alhambra.|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "Fables" [...] of Dryden are {{the best}} {{examples}} of his talents as a narrative poet; those powers of composition, description, and narration, which must have been called into exercise by the Epic Muse, had his fate allowed him to enlist among her votaries. The [...] "Knight's Tale," [...] the longest and most laboured of Chaucer's stories, possesses a degree of regularity which might satisfy the most severe critic. It is true, that the honour arising from thence must be assigned to the more ancient bard, who had himself drawn his subject from an Italian model; but the high and decided preference which Dryden has given to this story, although somewhat censured by Trapp, enables us to judge how much the poet held an accurate combination of parts, and coherence of narrative, essentials of epic poetry.[10] That a classic scholar like Trapp should think the plan of the [...] "Knight's Tale" [...] equal to that of the Iliad, is a degree of candour not to be hoped for; but surely to an unprejudiced reader, a story which exhausts in its conclusion all the interest which it has excited in its progress, which, when terminated, leaves no question to be asked, no personage undisposed of, and no curiosity unsatisfied, is, abstractedly considered, more gratifying than the history of a few weeks of a ten years' war, commencing long after the siege had begun, and ending long before the city was taken. Of the other tales, it can hardly be said that their texture is more ingenious or closely woven than that of ordinary novels or fables: but in each of them Dryden has displayed the superiority of his genius, in selecting for amplification and ornament those passages most susceptible of poetical description. The account of the procession of the Fairy Chivalry in the [...] "Flower and the Leaf;" [...] the splendid description of the champions who came to assist at the tournament in the [...] "Knight's Tale;" [...] the account of the battle itself, its alternations and issue,--if they cannot be called improvements on Chaucer, are nevertheless so spirited a transfusion of his ideas into modern verse, as almost to claim the merit of originality. Many passages might be shown in which this praise may be carried still higher, and the <b>merit</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> added to that of imitation. Such is the description of the commencement of the tourney, which is almost entirely original, and most of the ornaments in the translations from Boccacio, whose prose fictions demanded more additions from the poet than the exuberant imagery of Chaucer. To select instances would be endless; but every reader of poetry has by heart the description of Iphigenia asleep, nor are the lines in [...] "Theodore and Honoria,"[11] which describe the approach of the apparition, and its effects upon animated and inanimated nature even before it becomes visible, less eminent for beauties of the terrific order: ...|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} {{literature on}} the contribution of institutions to the British Industrial Revolution {{has it that the}} British patent system made a substantial contribution to the success of British inventors. After all, patents not only increased the rate <b>of</b> return to <b>invention,</b> but, as Adam Smith pointed out in his Lectures on Jurisprudence, created a proportionality between the economic significance <b>of</b> an <b>invention</b> and the return to the inventor, thus creating the perfect incentive. A legislator, Smith pointed out, would hardly ever be so precisely proportional to the <b>merit</b> <b>of</b> the <b>invention</b> as this is. Britain had a working patent system since 1624. France and other follower countries, by this account, only established patent systems after the French Revolution, and by that time, presumably, Britain s advantage was too firm to be challenged for many decades.

40|$|Functional {{claiming}} {{has been}} the issue {{at the heart of}} the software patent problem. Functional claiming is particularly problematic in software patents as inventors may use them to broadly claim an entire goal instead of a particular implementation. The accumulation of such software patents has created a patent thicket, leading to their abuse by patent trolls, causing extended litigation, and making it difficult for patent examiners to search through prior art. This paper presents an alternate approach by using nonobviousness to tackle the software problem in two phases: first during prosecution to prevent functional claims from being issued and second, post grant, through Markman hearings to retroactively invalidate functional claims prior to trial. By applying a nonobviousness filter, both the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office and courts can more efficiently weed out overbroad functional patents by focusing on the <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> the <b>invention</b> and the scope of claims instead of getting bogged down in determining whether a claim meets the requisite structural elements of § 112 (f) in order to then narrow the claim through the statute...|$|R
5000|$|On 14 December 1881 the {{stockholders}} of the Keely Motor Company held {{a meeting}} at which a report was read that complained that while they had faith in the <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> Keely's <b>invention,</b> the inventor was unreasonably secretive of the principles and operating methods of his apparatus. He had assured them that the [...] "generator" [...] had been perfected a year before, and that the [...] "multiplicator" [...] was also now perfected, and they considered it only fair and reasonable that {{the secrets of the}} machinery be revealed to them. They recommended that some intelligent and trustworthy person be taken into Keely's confidence [...] "so {{that in the case of}} accident they would not be totally without a clue to the invention". The report complained at some length about Keely's uncommunicativeness and said that it was the experience of everyone who had come into contact with him over the previous ten years that [...] "any attempt at a serious investigation of his operations has been met on his part with deception and misrepresentation".|$|R
5000|$|The inventions {{covered by}} complainant's patents {{are not of}} such {{character}} as to enable them, by retaining the exclusive use, to absorb either the making of shoes, or the minor work of fastening buttons to shoes. In the exercise {{of the right of}} exclusive use, they have put on the market a structure embodying their devices, and licensed the purchaser to use the invention [...] "only with staples" [...] made by themselves. In other words, they have chosen to fix the price for the right <b>of</b> use the <b>invention</b> at the profit resulting from the sale of staples. As observed by counsel for complainant, [...] "The fasteners are thus made the counters by which the royalty proportioned to the actual use of the machine is determined."This method of licensing their mechanism may or may not result in the engrossment of the market for staples. So long as their invention controls the market for button-fastening appliances, {{and to the extent that}} their machines shall supersede other modes of clinching staples, just so long will they be enabled to control the market for staples. Their monopoly in an unpatented article will depend upon the <b>merit</b> <b>of</b> their patented device, and the extent to which other clinching devices are superseded by it. In the last analysis, the invention destroyed the demand for sizes and shapes of staples not adapted to use with the machine of complainant[...] [...] [...] The monopoly in the unpatented staple results as an incident from the monopoly in the use <b>of</b> complainant's <b>invention,</b> and is therefore a legitimate result of the patentee's control over the use <b>of</b> his <b>invention</b> by others.

50|$|The {{responsibility}} for {{ensuring that the}} application is valid resides with the applicant. South Africa is a non-examining country. This means that CIPC does not investigate the novelty or inventive <b>merit</b> <b>of</b> the <b>invention</b> - only the form or documentation is verified and not {{the substance of the}} product or process. For peace of mind, the inventor can make use of the services of a qualified patent attorney to investigate the existence of previous patent specifications that relate to the relevant invention. This procedure, although expensive, may negate possible future litigation procedures and unnecessary financial expenses. It is crucial that an international patent search should be conducted, especially if an inventor wants to commercialise a product or process in foreign countries. The same applies for a patentee, who wants to commercialise an invention and who does not want to infringe someone else’s patent. A search should then be conducted at the South African Patent Office. An online search system is currently available at http://patentsearch.cipc.co.za, though the range of searchable fields is somewhat limited compared to other national patent search systems, and, as of the present writing (26 July 2013), the document retrieval system only returns empty documents. Searches can also be carried out by hand at the Patent Office through a card based system; however, electronic patent searches may be performed on a contract basis on proprietary systems such as the Electronic Patent Journal (EPJ).|$|R
