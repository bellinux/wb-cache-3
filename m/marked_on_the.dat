5|$|The {{traditional}} {{date for}} the feast of St Cynfarwy varies between antiquarian sources, although all place it in November. Some manuscripts say that it falls on the 10th, some on the 11th, whilst according to Angharad Llwyd and others the festival is <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 7th.|$|E
5|$|There are few {{compound}} words, {{but lots}} of derivations. The grammar employs a mixture of head and dependent marking: both agent and patient are <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> predicate and the possessor is marked on nouns, while dependent noun phrases inflect for case. The morphosyntactic alignment of Kalaallisut is ergative.|$|E

5|$|By1932, US72 and US78 {{switched}} {{routes in}} Mississippi, with the present-day alignment of MS172 again {{becoming part of}} US72 as initially planned in1926. In1935, the road was paved {{to the east of}} Iuka. The paved portion was extended slightly west of Iuka in1936 and further west by1938. By1939, the section of US72 that would be redesignated as MS172 was fully paved. In1986, US72 was moved to a new divided highway alignment to the south through Tishomingo County. By1998, MS172 was <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> former two-lane alignment of US72 in Tishomingo County.|$|E

5|$|By 1973, {{the road}} {{bypassed}} Columbia. In 1984, US 98 was routed to bypass Hattiesburg on I-59 {{and a new}} freeway. A bypass {{to the north of}} Tylertown was built for US 98 in 1985. US 98 was moved to a new alignment to bypass Lucedale in 1988. In 1996, US 98 was routed out of Beaumont and McLain {{as a result of the}} construction of a new alignment on a divided highway. By1998, MS198 was <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> six former alignments of US 98 in Tylertown, Columbia, Hattiesburg, Beaumont, McLain, and Lucedale. In 2005, the eastern terminus of the McLain section of MS 198 was truncated from US 98 to MS 57.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{mathematical}} calculations {{are performed}} by aligning a <b>mark</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sliding central strip with a <b>mark</b> <b>on</b> one of <b>the</b> fixed strips, and then observing the relative positions of other <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> strips. Numbers {{aligned with the}} marks give the approximate value of the product, quotient, or other calculated result.|$|R

5|$|Route98 was {{initially}} designated in 1924 on a route in western Illinois. The state planned {{the road to}} connect Route3 east of Macomb to Route95 near Havana by way of Adair, Table Grove, Ipava, and Duncan Mills. The route was first <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 1928 Illinois highway map; at this point, the road connected Table Grove {{in the west to}} U.S. Route 24 (US24) and Route31 at Duncans Mills in the east. By 1929, the highway's western terminus was extended to Route9 east of Macomb. The original route became part of Route10 between 1936 and 1939, at which time the Route98 designation was transferred to its present alignment. The original Route98 is now part of US136.|$|E
5|$|Since November 2002, by-elections {{have been}} held to fill vacancies. Two by-elections were held in 2003, one in 2004, four in 2005, one in each of 2007, 2008 and 2009, two in 2010, four in 2011, two in 2013, four in 2014, six in 2015, two in 2016 and two in 2017. Voting is by {{preferential}} voting, with peers ranking the candidates in order of preference. As many or as few preferences as desired may be indicated. To win the election, a peer must receive a majority of first preference votes. If no candidate receives such a majority, the candidate with the fewest number of first preference votes is eliminated, with each of his votes being redistributed according to the second preference <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ballot (see Instant-runoff voting). The process is continued until one candidate receives a majority.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} {{volume is}} commonly quoted {{in most countries}} using the metric system. This information is required by ISO13769 to be stamped on the cylinder shoulder. It can be measured easily by filling the cylinder with fresh water. This {{has resulted in the}} term 'water capacity', abbreviated as WC which is often stamp <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cylinder shoulder. It's almost always expressed as a volume in litres, but sometimes as mass of the water in kg. Fresh water has a density close to one kilogram per litre so the numerical values are effectively identical at one decimal place accuracy.|$|E

5|$|The {{upper parts}} are {{generally}} light greyish brown with dark brown centres to the feathers, giving {{the appearance of}} stripes. These stripes are <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head and nape, less distinct on the rump and almost absent from the upper tail coverts. The underparts are whitish with faint streaks on the belly. The feathers of the upper breast and throat are long and pointed, giving the head a spiky appearance. The wing and tail are both moderately long with rounded tips. The bill is short, with a sharp pointed appearance, dark blue-grey grading to a grey-black at the tip and around the nostrils. Legs and feet are blue-grey with black claws. The bare skin around the eye is dark brown and the iris a dark black-brown.|$|E
5|$|At 05:45, Lieutenant-Colonel Mehmet Sefik of the Turkish 27th Infantry Regiment {{received}} {{orders to}} move his 1st and 3rd Battalions {{to the west and}} support the 2nd Battalion around Gaba Tepe. The two battalions were already assembled, having spent that night carrying out military exercises. They could not be sent to Ari Burnu as it was not <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Turkish maps. Colonel Halil Sami, commanding the 9th Division, also ordered the division's machine-gun company and an artillery battery to move in support of the 27th Infantry Regiment, followed soon after by an 77mm artillery battery. At 08:00 Lieutenant-Colonel Mustafa Kemal, commanding the 19th Division, was ordered to send a battalion to support them. Kemal instead decided to go himself with the 57th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battery towards Chunuk Bair, which he realised was the key point in the defence; whoever held those heights would dominate the battlefield. By chance, the 57th Infantry were supposed to have been on an exercise that morning around Hill 971 and had been prepared since 05:30, waiting for orders.|$|E
5|$|Copperbelt was a {{province}} in Northern Rhodesia which was rich in deposits of the mineral. Cecil John Rhodes, a British capitalist and empire builder, {{was the leading}} light of British expansion north of the Limpopo River into south-central Africa. In 1895, Rhodes asked his American scout Frederick Russell Burnham to look for minerals and how to improve river navigation in the region; during this trek, Burnham discovered large copper deposits along the Kafue River. Rhodes brought British influence into the region by obtaining mineral rights from local chiefs through questionable treaties. The Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891, signed in Lisbon on 11 June 1891 by the United Kingdom and Portugal, fixed the boundary between territories administered by the British South Africa Company (BSAC) in North-Eastern Rhodesia and Portuguese Mozambique. It also fixed {{the boundary between the}} BSAC-administered territory of North-Western Rhodesia (now in Zambia) and Portuguese Angola, although the boundary with Angola was not <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground until later. The northern border of the British territory in North-Eastern Rhodesia and the British Central Africa Protectorate was agreed in an 1890 Anglo-German treaty which also fixed the (very short) boundary between North-Western Rhodesia and German South-West Africa, now Namibia. The boundary between the Congo Free State and British territory was fixed by an 1894 treaty, although minor adjustments were made until the 1930s. The border between the British Central Africa Protectorate and North-Eastern Rhodesia was fixed in 1891 at the drainage divide between Lake Malawi and the Luangwa River, and the boundary between North-Western Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia became the Zambezi River in 1898. Northern Rhodesia was under BSAC control until 1924, when it became part of the British Empire.|$|E

5|$|Further {{excavations}} were {{undertaken in}} the 1920s by C. R. Peers, who found that the nave of the original church had external doors on the north, south and west sides, and that the chancel had doors leading into {{the north and south}} porticus, which in turn had external doors on their eastern sides. Regarding the floor described by Dowker, Peers noted that the surface consisted of a thin layer of pounded brick, and believed that it was of the same date as the stone which Dowker described as the foundations for the stone cross. Excavations also revealed steps leading down to the burial vault reported by Dowker, although Peers did not refer to either the steps or the vault in his report. Extensions of the porticus to the west and around the original west front were dated to no more than 100years after the church was first built, and Peers observed that these extensions had been given the same type of floor as the original church. Drawing comparisons with the 7th-century chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall at Bradwell-on-Sea, in Essex, and the abbey of St Augustine at Canterbury, Peers suggested that the original church at Reculver probably had windows set high in the northern and southern walls of the nave. Areas of wall found by archaeologists but now missing above ground are <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site by strips of concrete edged with flint.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF's Chinook fleet {{suffered}} two serious accidents. On 26 June 1975, A15-011 crashed {{when one}} of its engine turbines disintegrated. No. 3 Aircraft Depot was assigned responsibility for repairing the helicopter, {{but it did not}} reenter service until 21 May 1981 as the maintenance unit lacked experience with major helicopter repairs. On 4 February 1985, A15-001 struck power lines and crashed into Perseverance Dam near Toowoomba, Queensland, while undertaking a navigation exercise. The helicopter's pilot, an exchange officer from the Royal Air Force, was killed and the other three aircrew suffered minor injuries. The helicopter was written off and used as a fire training aid at Amberley. The court of inquiry into this incident found that the air crew were unaware of the presence of the power lines as they were not <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> maps used to plan the flight, and were difficult to see. However, the inquiry also judged that the mission had been inadequately planned and recommended that No. 12 Squadron update the master map used for preparing operations in the Amberley region to ensure that it included all flying hazards.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of US113 to be {{expanded}} to a divided highway {{was part of the}} new US13 bypass of Dover. The latter highway's new four-lane course, which included a new bridge across the St. Jones River, was constructed starting in 1950 and opened to traffic April 16, 1952. As part of the project, the portion of US113 from State Street north of Silver Lake to the new US13 highway was expanded to a divided highway, and both U.S. Highways were <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> expanded highway from State Street to their split at the modern intersection of US13 and Bay Road. DSHD may have removed US 113 markers from north of Bay Road as early as 1965, and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the northern terminus of the U.S. Highway being retracted from the north end of State Street to where US 13 meets Bay Road at their spring 1974 meeting. In conjunction, AASHTO approved removing US 113 Alternate from State Street north of US 13 and instead following US 13 to US 113's northern terminus.|$|E
