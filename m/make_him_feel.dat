5|$|Gee (Yaphet Kotto) {{informs the}} detectives that Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) {{has been shot}} in the head, and he orders an {{immediate}} investigation. Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) arrive at the hospital to find the doctors working frantically on Thormann; Crosetti, a close friend of Thormann, becomes very emotional. Crosetti comforts Thormann's wife Eva (Edie Falco), but is privately told by Dr. Eli Devilbiss (Sean Whitesell) that Thormann may be blind or mentally disabled, even if he survives. Crosetti begs Gee to give him the case and, even though Gee believes he is too emotionally involved, he gives in when Crosetti tries to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> guilty by showing him his previous gunshot wounds. When an investigation at the crime scene turns up nothing, Lewis catches Crosetti praying with a rosary in the locker room. Crosetti convinces a skeptical Lewis to pray with him for help in the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying to help him, <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E
500|$|Endino billed {{the band}} thirty hours of {{recording}} at $606.17. Jason Everman, a guitarist who {{was impressed by}} Nirvana's demo with Dale Crover, supplied the money. He briefly joined the group as second guitarist. Everman was credited as a guitarist on the album sleeve, and is the other guitarist {{on the cover of}} the album, even though he did not perform on the album. Bassist Krist Novoselic explained, [...] "We just wanted to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> at home in the band." ...|$|E

5000|$|Joel Kinnaman {{spoke about}} the scene between Holder and his nephew: [...] "I really loved that scene. There were so many {{conflicting}} emotions, which is something I love to play. He has a desperation where he seeks his nephew out because he needs him. His nephew {{is one of the}} people that <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> like he's a good person. It <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> real and grounded, {{but at the same time}} he knows he's not supposed to him. He's almost looking for help, but then he realizes he's using his favorite person for his own benefit, and it <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> ashamed. And Boey who plays Davie is such a wonderful kid. He breaks my heart." ...|$|R

500|$|Upon {{hearing his}} classmates {{tell him that}} they hold him in the lowest regard {{possible}} {{and that they could}} not possibly think any worse of him, a stubborn Cartman misinterprets this act as their attempt to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> better, and convinces himself that everyone thinks he is the [...] "coolest kid in school". In the season 13 (2009) episode [...] "Fishsticks", Cartman subconsciously believes that he helped in creating a joke that quickly becomes a nationwide sensation, {{despite the fact that the}} character Jimmy Valmer writes the joke without any assistance. Carlos Delgado of If Magazine noted this as [...] "Cartman being so egotistical that he manipulates the past to serve his own purposes".|$|E
500|$|Brian Logan {{wrote in}} the Guardian that though Partridge was created as a satire of the [...] "asinine fluency of broadcaster-speak" [...] of the time, his study of {{character}} traits gave the character a timeless quality. Guardian writer John Crace wrote: [...] "By rights, Alan Partridge should have been dead as a character years ago, the last drops of humour long since wrung out ... but Steve Coogan keeps finding ways to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> fresh." [...] Reviewing Alpha Papa in 2013, the Independent wrote that Partridge is a [...] "disarming creation" [...] and that despite his flaws [...] "we always root for him." [...] Guardian critic Alexis Petridis wrote that [...] "one of the reasons audiences find [...] funny is that they recognise at least a bit of themselves in him." ...|$|E
500|$|By December 1915, New Delhi felt it {{necessary}} to put more pressure on the Afghans. Communications between the British Empire and Kabul had been hitherto through the Viceroy at Delhi. Acutely aware of the pressure on Habibullah from his pro-German relatives and the strong anti-British feeling among the tribes, Viceroy Hardinge suggested that a letter from King George might help Habibullah maintain his neutrality. Accordingly, George V personally sent a handwritten letter on Buckingham Palace stationery to Habibullah, praising the Emir for his steadfast neutrality and promising an increase to his subsidy. The letter, which addressed Habibullah as [...] "Your Majesty", was intended to encourage Habibullah and <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> an equal partner in the Empire. It had the intended effect: Habibullah sent verbal communication through British agents in Kabul that he could not formally acknowledge the letter because of political pressure, but he nonetheless sent reassurances he would remain neutral.|$|E

500|$|In the Elizabethan era, {{toothache}} was an ailment {{associated with}} lovers, as in Massinger and Fletcher's play The False One. Toothache also {{appears in a}} number of William Shakespeare's plays, such as Othello and Cymbeline. In Much Ado About Nothing, Act III scene 2, when asked by his companions why he is feeling sad, a character replies that he has toothache so as not to admit the truth that he is in love. There is reference to [...] "toothworm" [...] as the cause of toothache and to tooth extraction as a cure ("draw it"). In Act V, scene 1, another character remarks: [...] "For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently." [...] In modern parlance, this translates to the observation that philosophers are still human and feel pain, even though they claim they have transcended human suffering and misfortune. In effect, the character is rebuking his friend for trying to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> better with philosophical platitudes.|$|E
500|$|Poniewozik complimented the way [...] "Monteith really sold Finn’s {{feeling of}} being {{helpless}} and overmatched", and Canning said that Finn's reaction to Rachel's admission {{that she wanted to}} have sex because of the play was a [...] "solid and true moment". Rachel's reasoning, however, came in for harsh criticism: Brett Berk of Vanity Fair said it was [...] "neither believable nor even amusing" [...] that she would try intercourse for such a reason, Bell called her a [...] "dunce", and VanDerWerff didn't believe that she would just blurt it out to Finn. The Star-Ledger Vicki Hyman felt her decision {{to go all the way}} did not [...] "ring quite true", and Poniewozik called it [...] "essentially pity sex". Ausiello had a different view—"I would hardly call it pity sex"—and West said she was [...] "going to choose to believe" [...] that Rachel did not have her first time [...] "just to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> better".|$|E
500|$|Will and Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) {{finalize}} their divorce. Attempting to {{deal with}} his sorrow and cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester's (Jane Lynch) incessant bullying, Will seduces Sue with a performance of [...] "Tell Me Something Good" [...] and asks her out on a date, standing her up to humiliate her. Sue withdraws the cheerleading squad from the upcoming Nationals competition and becomes bed-bound. Will sees the negative impact on the cheerleaders and realizes that some of them might lose their college scholarships. Will knows that hurting his nemesis did not <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> any better, and encourages her to be there for her girls. Sue reenters and wins Nationals, but later gives Will two options: either house her new trophy inside New Directions' choir room, or kiss her. As Will is about to kiss her, Sue backs out and decides she prefers that the trophy be set up in the choir room as a reminder of her superiority.|$|E

500|$|Grant began {{experimenting with}} the drug LSD in the late 1950s, before it became popular. His wife, Betsy Drake, {{displayed}} {{a keen interest in}} psychotherapy, and through her Grant developed a considerable knowledge of the field of psychoanalysis. Radiologist Mortimer Hartman began treating him with LSD in the late 1950s, with Grant optimistic that the treatment could <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> better about himself and rid of all of his inner turmoil stemming from his childhood and his failed relationships. He had an estimated 100 sessions over several years. For a long time, Grant viewed the drug positively, and stated that it was the solution after many years of [...] "searching for his peace of mind", and that for {{first time in his life}} he was [...] "truly, deeply and honestly happy". Cannon claimed during a court hearing, in which she claimed he was an [...] "apostle of LSD", that he was still taking the drug in 1967 as part of a remedy to save their relationship. Grant later admitted that [...] "taking LSD was an utterly foolish thing to do but I was a self-opinionated boor, hiding all kinds of layers and defences, hypocrisy and vanity. I had to get rid of them and wipe the slate clean".|$|E
500|$|Malone {{stated that}} Todd {{believes}} {{that he does not}} deserve forgiveness, which contributes to him embracing his worst qualities, something Malone felt worked better due to Howarth's acting choices, which prevented Todd from acquiring redemption easily. Malone felt {{the most important part of}} Todd's redemption was to have him re-confront Marty in order to better deal with the fact he initiated her rape. As well as having Todd risk his freedom from prison and save Marty from a car crash, Todd donates his own blood to Marty to ensure she survives. A year later, he risks his life to save Patrick, Marty's lover, from death; this act leads to Todd's presumed death. Despite having the character yearn to be thought of as a decent human being, the writers felt his good deeds should never <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> any less horrible for having raped Marty. [...] Initially, Howarth disagreed, and did not consider the storylines to be redemptive. [...] " [...] not being redeemed at all," [...] he said. [...] "Todd, as I see it, is looking for a way to overcome this rage so he can live in society again. From now on, his menace will be on the surface, not exploding. It's more interesting if his violence is on the surface and that he play against it. That's where the subtlety is." ...|$|E
500|$|Nirvana {{released}} its first single, {{a cover of}} Shocking Blue's [...] "Love Buzz", in November 1988 on the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop. They did their first ever interview with John Robb in Sounds [...] who also made the release single of the week. The following month, the band began recording its debut album, Bleach, with local producer Jack Endino. Bleach was highly influenced by the heavy dirge-rock of the Melvins and Mudhoney, 1980s punk rock, and the 1970s heavy metal of Black Sabbath. Novoselic said in a 2001 interview with Rolling Stone that the band had played a tape in their van while on tour that had an album by The Smithereens {{on one side and}} an album by the extreme metal band Celtic Frost on the other, and noted that the combination probably played an influence as well. The money for the recording sessions for Bleach, listed as $606.17 on the album sleeve, was supplied by Jason Everman, who was subsequently brought into the band as the second guitarist. Though Everman did not actually play on the album, he received a credit on Bleach because, according to Novoselic, they [...] "wanted to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> more at home in the band". Just prior to the album's release, Nirvana insisted on signing an extended contract with Sub Pop, making the band the first to do so with the label.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of Subterranean Jungle, Marky was fired from the band due to his alcoholism. He was {{replaced}} by Richard Reinhardt, who adopted the name Richie Ramone. Joey Ramone remarked that [...] " [...] saved the band as far as I'm concerned. He's the greatest thing {{to happen to the}} Ramones. He put the spirit back in the band." [...] Richie is the only Ramones drummer to sing lead vocals on Ramones songs, including [...] "(You) Can't Say Anything Nice" [...] as well as the unreleased [...] "Elevator Operator". Joey Ramone commented, [...] "Richie's very talented and he's very diverse... He really strengthened the band a hundred percent because he sings backing tracks, he sings lead, and he sings with Dee Dee's stuff. In the past, it was always just me singing for the most part." [...] Richie was also the only drummer to be the sole composer of Ramones songs including their hit [...] "Somebody Put Something in My Drink" [...] as well as [...] "Smash You", [...] "Humankind", [...] "I'm Not Jesus", [...] "I Know Better Now" [...] and [...] "(You) Can't Say Anything Nice". Joey Ramone supported Richie's songwriting contributions: [...] "I encouraged Richie to write songs. I figured it would <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> more a part of the group, because we never let anybody else write our songs." [...] Richie's composition, [...] "Somebody Put Something in My Drink", remained a staple in the Ramones set list until their last show in 1996 and was included in the album Loud, Fast Ramones: Their Toughest Hits. The eightsong bonus disc, The Ramones Smash You: Live'85, is also named after Richie's composition [...] "Smash You".|$|E

I wanted to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> good.' His attraction to dogs became stronger in his teens and stronger yet in his 20s. 'For years, I thought I {{was the only one}} who did this,' James says. 'I felt like there was no one I could talk to about this. I definitely knew I wasn't going to be talking to my parents or my friends about this.' 'This is not a fetish,' James says of his attractions. 'It's an orientation, a lifestyle.'" ...|$|E

After Neil Lennon left Celtic {{at the end of}} the 2013–14 season, Keane looked set to become the new manager of the Hoops. Martin O'Neill admitted he won't stand in his way of taking over the reins at Celtic Park. Keane, however, remained as assistant manager of Ireland and asked not to be considered for the job. Keane later stated that he was on the verge on taking the Celtic job and had met with Celtic owner Dermot Desmond but felt [...] "they didn't <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> wanted enough" [...] and rejected the offer.|$|E

Stewart Lee has remarked during an interview on the BBC4 programme Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe that he feels lucky for having been a teenager watching TV for teenagers in the 1970s and not the 2000s as [...] "there was something really comforting for nerds and weirdos about programmes like Children of the Stones and The Changes." [...] He said that watching Skins as a teenager today would <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> lonelier than he already would have been.
