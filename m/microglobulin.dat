These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium. Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen. This creates osmotic pressure and draws water into the CSF, facilitated by aquaporins. Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain electroneutrality. Potassium and bicarbonate are also transported out of the CSF. As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein. Choroid plexuses also secrete growth factors, vitamins B1, 12 C, folate, beta-2 <b>microglobulin,</b> arginine vasopressin and nitrous oxide into the CSF. A Na-K-Cl cotransporter and Na/K ATPase found {{on the surface of}} the choroid endothelium, appears to play a role in regulating CSF secretion and composition.|$|E
25|$|Protein encoded by {{this gene}} is a {{membrane}} protein {{that is similar}} to MHC class I-type proteins and associates with beta-2 <b>microglobulin</b> (beta2M). It is thought that this protein functions to regulate circulating iron uptake by regulating the interaction of the transferrin receptor with transferrin.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of blood}} test panels may help in diagnosis. The OVA1 panel {{includes}} CA-125, beta-2 <b>microglobulin,</b> transferrin, apolipoprotein A1, and transthyretin. OVA1 above 5.0 in premenopausal people and 4.4 in postmenopausal people indicates {{a high risk}} for cancer. A different set of laboratory tests is used for detecting sex cord-stromal tumors. High levels of testosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, combined with other symptoms {{and high levels of}} inhibin A and inhibin B can be indicative of an SCST of any type.|$|E
25|$|MHC I {{occurs as}} an α chain {{composed}} of three domains—α1, α2, and α3. The α1 rests upon {{a unit of}} the non-MHC molecule β2 <b>microglobulin</b> (encoded on human chromosome 15). The α3 domain is transmembrane, anchoring the MHC class I molecule to the cell membrane. The peptide being presented is held by the floor of the peptide-binding groove, in the central region of the α1/α2 heterodimer (a molecule composed of two nonidentical subunits). The genetically encoded and expressed sequence of amino acids, the sequence of residues, of the peptide-binding groove's floor determines which particular peptide residues it binds.|$|E
5000|$|Levels of β2 <b>microglobulin</b> can be {{elevated}} {{in multiple}} myeloma and lymphoma, though {{in these cases}} primary amyloidosis (amyloid light chain) and secondary amyloidosis (amyloid associated protein) are more common. The normal value of β2 <b>microglobulin</b> is <2 mg/L. However, with respect to multiple myeloma, the levels of β2 <b>microglobulin</b> may also be {{at the other end}} of the spectrum. Diagnostic testing for multiple myeloma includes obtaining the β2 <b>microglobulin</b> level, for this level is an important prognostic indicator. [...] A patient with a level <4 mg/L is expected to have a median survival of 43 months, while one with a level >4 mg/L has a median survival of only 12 months. [...] β2 <b>microglobulin</b> levels cannot, however, distinguish between monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), which has a better prognosis, and smouldering (low grade) myeloma.|$|E

5000|$|Mice models {{deficient}} for the β2 <b>microglobulin</b> gene {{have been}} engineered. These mice demonstrate that β2 <b>microglobulin</b> {{is necessary for}} cell surface expression of MHC class I and stability of the peptide binding groove. In fact, {{in the absence of}} β2 <b>microglobulin,</b> very limited amounts of MHC class I (classical and non-classical) molecules can be detected on the surface. In the absence of MHC class I, CD8 T cells cannot develop. (CD8 T cells are a subset of T cells involved in the development of acquired immunity.) ...|$|E

50|$|HLA-A is a {{group of}} human {{leukocyte}} antigens (HLA) that are coded for by the HLA-A locus, which is located at human chromosome 6p21.3. HLA is a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen specific to humans. HLA-A is one of three major types of human MHC class I cell surface receptors. The others are HLA-B and HLA-C. The receptor is a heterodimer, and is composed of a heavy α chain and smaller β chain. The α chain is encoded by a variant HLA-A gene, and the β chain (β2-microglobulin) is an invariant β2 <b>microglobulin</b> molecule. The β2 <b>microglobulin</b> protein is coded for by a separate region of the human genome.|$|E
5000|$|... β2 <b>microglobulin</b> lies {{beside the}} α3 chain {{on the cell}} surface. Unlike α3, β2 has no transmembrane region. Directly above β2 (that is, further away from the cell) lies the α1 chain, which itself is next to the α2.|$|E
50|$|Other useful {{laboratory}} tests include quantitative measurement of IgA, IgG, IgM (immunoglobulins) {{to look for}} immune paresis, and beta-2 <b>microglobulin</b> which provides prognostic information. On peripheral blood smear, the rouleaux formation of red blood cells is commonly seen, though this is not specific.|$|E
50|$|The TAP {{transporter}} {{is found}} in the ER lumen associated with the peptide-loading complex (PLC). This complex of β2 <b>microglobulin,</b> calreticulin, ERp57, TAP, tapasin, and MHC class I acts to keep hold of MHC molecules until they have been fully loaded with peptides.|$|E

50|$|Beta-2 <b>microglobulin</b> {{is another}} risk factor in MCL used {{primarily}} for transplant patients. Values less than 3 have yielded 95% overall survival to 6 yrs for auto SCT where over 3 yields {{a median of}} 44 most overall survival for auto SCT (Khouri 03). This is not yet fully validated.|$|E
50|$|CD4 {{uses its}} D1 domain to {{interact}} with the β2-domain of MHC class II molecules. T cells expressing CD4 molecules (and not CD8) on their surface, therefore, are specific for antigens presented by MHC II and not by MHC class I (they are MHC class II-restricted). MHC class I contains Beta-2 <b>microglobulin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Alpha-1-microglobulin (A1M, α1-microglobulin, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} Protein HC) is a <b>microglobulin,</b> a small globular protein. It {{is found in}} all vertebrates, including humans, and is distributed in blood plasma and extravascular tissues of all organs. It is synthesized in most cells of the body, but mainly in the liver from a gene that codes for the alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor.|$|E
50|$|Allovectin-7 is a {{substance}} that is being studied as a gene therapy agent {{in the treatment of}} cancer, such as malignant melanoma. It is a plasmid/lipid complex containing the DNA sequences encoding HLA-B7 and ß2 <b>microglobulin</b> - two components of major histocompatibility complex (MHC, class I). It increases the ability of the immune system to recognize cancer cells and kill them.|$|E
50|$|Increased {{concentrations}} of urinary beta-2 <b>microglobulin</b> {{can be an}} early indicator of renal dysfunction in persons chronically exposed to low but excessive levels of environmental cadmium. The urinary beta-2 <b>microglobulin</b> test is an indirect method of measuring cadmium exposure. Under some circumstances, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration requires screening for renal damage in workers with long-term exposure {{to high levels of}} cadmium. Blood or urine cadmium concentrations provide a better index of excessive exposure in industrial situations or following acute poisoning, whereas organ tissue (lung, liver, kidney) cadmium concentrations may be useful in fatalities resulting from either acute or chronic poisoning. Cadmium concentrations in healthy persons without excessive cadmium exposure are generally less than 1 μg/L in either blood or urine. The ACGIH biological exposure indices for blood and urine cadmium levels are 5 μg/L and 5 μg/g creatinine, respectively, in random specimens. Persons who have sustained renal damage due to chronic cadmium exposure often have blood or urine cadmium levels in a range of 25-50 μg/L or 25-75 μg/g creatinine, respectively. These ranges are usually 1000-3000 μg/L and 100-400 μg/g, respectively, in survivors of acute poisoning and may be substantially higher in fatal cases.|$|E
50|$|Like other MHC class I molecules, HLA-E is a {{heterodimer}} {{consisting of}} an α heavy chain {{and a light}} chain (β-2 <b>microglobulin).</b> The heavy chain is approximately 45 kDa and anchored in the membrane. The HLA-E gene contains 8 exons. Exon one encodes the signal peptide, exons 2 and 3 encode the α1 and α2 domains, which both bind the peptide, exon 4 encodes the α3 domain, exon 5 encodes the transmembrane domain, and exons 6 and 7 encode the cytoplasmic tail.|$|E
50|$|Use {{of blood}} test panels may help in diagnosis. The OVA1 panel {{includes}} CA-125, beta-2 <b>microglobulin,</b> transferrin, apolipoprotein A1, and transthyretin.

High levels of testosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, combined with other symptoms {{and high levels of}} inhibin A and inhibin B can be indicative of an SCST of any type.|$|E
50|$|Chemistry tests include lactate {{dehydrogenase}} (LDH) levels, uric acid levels, {{erythrocyte sedimentation rate}} (ESR), kidney and liver function, total protein levels, and an albumin-to-globulin ratio. The ESR and uric acid level may be elevated. Creatinine is occasionally elevated and electrolytes are occasionally abnormal. A high blood calcium level is noted in approximately 4% of patients. The LDH level is frequently elevated, indicating the extent of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia-related tissue involvement. Rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulins, direct antiglobulin test and cold agglutinin titre results can be positive. Beta-2 <b>microglobulin</b> and C-reactive protein test results are not specific for Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. Beta-2 <b>microglobulin</b> is elevated in proportion to tumor mass. Coagulation abnormalities may be present. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and fibrinogen tests should be performed. Platelet aggregation studies are optional. Serum protein electrophoresis results indicate evidence of a monoclonal spike but cannot establish the spike as IgM. An M component with beta-to-gamma mobility is highly suggestive of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. Immunoelectrophoresis and immunofixation studies help identify the type of immunoglobulin, the clonality of the light chain, and the monoclonality and quantitation of the paraprotein. High-resolution electrophoresis and serum and urine immunofixation are recommended to help identify and characterize the monoclonal IgM paraprotein.|$|E
5000|$|Human {{inflammatory}} bowel {{disease is}} a group of inflammatory conditions in the large and small intestine. It is well known that chronic inflammation in the colon can lead to cancer. There are genetic mouse models for {{inflammatory bowel disease}} associated colon cancer. Interleukin 10 knock out mice develop invasive adenocarcinoma in the colon. [...] Mutant mice for interleukin 2 and beta <b>microglobulin</b> genes also produce ulcerative colitis-like phenotype and develop adenocarcinomas in the colon. [...] A mouse mutant for N-cadherin suffers inflammatory bowel disease conditions and adenomas but does not develop carcinomas.|$|E
50|$|Apolipoprotein D (Apo-D) is a {{component}} of high-density lipoprotein that has no marked similarity to other apolipoprotein sequences. It has {{a high degree of}} homology to plasma retinol-binding protein {{and other members of the}} alpha 2 <b>microglobulin</b> protein superfamily of carrier proteins, also known as lipocalins. It is a glycoprotein of estimated molecular weight 33 KDa. Apo-D is closely associated with the enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase - an enzyme involved in lipoprotein metabolism. ApoD has also been shown to be an important link in the transient interaction between HDL and LDL particles and between HDL particles and cells.|$|E

50|$|His work in {{the area}} of human {{genetics}} and liver disease led him to define the genetic nature of Wilson's Disease, which affects the liver and brain, and showed that the disease was associated with a deficiency in the blood of ceruloplasmin, a copper-binding protein. He also discovered that the urine level of B2 <b>microglobulin,</b> was a sensitive indicator of proximal renal tubular damage. This protein was later shown to be of great immunological importance {{as a part of the}} human leukocyte antigen histo-compatibility system. His laboratory also described a number of genetic variants in serum proteins that allowed for later work in serum enzymes.|$|E
50|$|HLA-F {{belongs to}} the non-{{classical}} HLA class I heavy chain paralogues. Compared to classical HLA class I molecules, it exhibits very few polymorphisms. This class I molecule mainly exists as a heterodimer associated with the invariant light chain beta-2 <b>microglobulin.</b> The heavy chain is approximately 42 kDa and its gene contains 8 exons. Exon one encodes the leader peptide, exons 2 and 3 encode the alpha1 and alpha2 domains, the putative peptide binding sites, exon 4 encodes the alpha3 domain, exon 5 and 6 encode the transmembrane region and exons 7 and 8 the cytoplasmic tail. However, exons 7 and 8 (the cytoplasmic tail) are not translated due to an in-frame translation termination codon in exon 6.|$|E
50|$|HLA-G {{belongs to}} the HLA nonclassical class I heavy chain paralogues. This class I {{molecule}} is a heterodimer consisting of a heavy chain and a light chain (beta-2 <b>microglobulin).</b> The heavy chain is anchored in the membrane. HLA-G is expressed on fetal derived placental cells. The heavy chain is approximately 45 kDa and its gene contains 8 exons. Exon one encodes the leader peptide, exons 2 and 3 encode the alpha1 and alpha2 domain, which both bind the peptide, exon 4 encodes the alpha3 domain, exon 5 encodes the transmembrane region, and exon 6 encodes the cytoplasmic tail. Exon 7 and 8 are not translated due to a stop codon present in exon 6.|$|E
50|$|Tapasin is a MHC class I antigen-processing {{molecule}} {{present in}} the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. It {{plays an important role}} in the maturation of MHC class I molecules in the ER lumen. Tapasin is one component of the peptide-loading complex, and can be found associated with MHC class I molecules after the MHC class I heavy chain has associated with Beta2 <b>microglobulin.</b> The peptide-loading complex consists of TAP, tapasin, MHC class I, calreticulin, and ERp57. Tapasin recruits MHC class I molecules to the TAP peptide transporter, and also enhances loading of MHC class I with high-affinity peptides. Following loading of MHC class I with a high-affinity ligand, the interaction between tapasin and MHC class I disappears.|$|E
50|$|Clinically, PMLBCL {{is unusual}} in several respects. It affects {{primarily}} young adults; the median age is 37 years. It {{is more common in}} females. Despite 80% PMLBCL being stage I or II, the presenting anterior mediastinal mass is often over 10 cm and is locally invasive of lung, chest wall, pleura, and pericardium. Superior vena cava syndrome occurs in 30-50%, and pleural or pericardial effusions occur in about one-third. At initial presentation, PMLBCL is usually confined to mediastinum, but its bulk, rather than additional adenpathy, can sometimes may be palpated at the low neck. Increased LDH is seen in approximately 75%, but unlike other large cell lymphomas, no increase in beta-2 <b>microglobulin</b> is seen even when bulky which may relate to defective major histocompatibility complex expression.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of unexplained anemia, kidney dysfunction, a high {{erythrocyte sedimentation rate}} (ESR), lytic bone lesions, elevated beta-2 <b>microglobulin,</b> and/or a high serum protein (especially raised globulins or immunoglobulin) may prompt further testing. The globulin level may be normal in established disease. A doctor will request protein electrophoresis of the blood and urine, which might show the {{presence of}} a paraprotein (monoclonal protein, or M protein) band, with or without reduction of the other (normal) immunoglobulins (known as immune paresis). One type of paraprotein is the Bence Jones protein which is a urinary paraprotein composed of free light chains (see below). Quantitative measurements of the paraprotein are necessary to establish a diagnosis and to monitor the disease. The paraprotein is an abnormal immunoglobulin produced by the tumor clone.|$|E
50|$|These {{theories}} {{refer to}} the unusual biochemical properties that HLA-B27 has. The misfolding hypothesis suggests that slow folding during HLA-B27's tertiary structure folding and association with β2 <b>microglobulin</b> causes the protein to be misfolded, therefore initiating the unfolded protein response (UPR) - a pro-inflammatory endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. However, although this mechanism has been demonstrated both in vitro and in animals, {{there is little evidence}} of its occurrence in human spondyloarthritis. Also, the HLA-B27 heavy chain homodimer formation hypothesis suggests that B27 heavy chains tend to dimerise and accumulate in the ER, once again, initiating the UPR. Alternatively, cell surface B27 heavy chains and dimers can bind to regulatory immune receptors such as members of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor family, promoting the survival and differentiation of pro-inflammatory leukocytes in disease.|$|E
50|$|MHC class I {{molecules}} are heterodimers that {{consist of}} two polypeptide chains, α and β2-microglobulin (b2m). The two chains are linked noncovalently via interaction of b2m and the α3 domain. Only the α chain is polymorphic and encoded by a HLA gene, while the b2m subunit is not polymorphic and encoded by the Beta-2 <b>microglobulin</b> gene. The α3 domain is plasma membrane-spanning and {{interacts with the}} CD8 co-receptor of T-cells. The α3-CD8 interaction holds the MHC I molecule in place while the T cell receptor (TCR) {{on the surface of}} the cytotoxic T cell binds its α1-α2 heterodimer ligand, and checks the coupled peptide for antigenicity. The α1 and α2 domains fold to make up a groove for peptides to bind. MHC class I molecules bind peptides that are 8-10 amino acid in length (Parham 87).|$|E
