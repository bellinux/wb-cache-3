50|$|Persons with knock knees {{often have}} {{collapsed}} inner arches of their feet, and their inner <b>ankle</b> <b>bones</b> are generally lower than their outer <b>ankle</b> <b>bones.</b> Adults with uncorrected genu valgum are typically prone to injury and chronic knee {{problems such as}} chondromalacia and osteoarthritis. These in turn can cause severe pain and problems in walking.|$|R

50|$|As in most archosaurs, {{distinguishing}} features {{can be seen}} in the shape of the <b>ankle</b> <b>bones.</b> A projection on the calcaneum bone called the calcaneal tuber is narrow and positioned downward relative to other lateral projections on the bone. The calcaneum also has a facet that attaches to both the fibula bone of the leg and another tarsal, or <b>ankle</b> <b>bone.</b> A hemicylindrical facet on the calcaneum attaches to another <b>bone</b> in the <b>ankle</b> called the astragalus. The astragalus has facets that attach to the tibia and fibula that are adjacent to each other.|$|R

50|$|An ankle {{fracture}} is a {{break of}} the <b>ankle</b> <b>bones.</b> It is typically diagnosed by X-ray. Treatment is with splinting, casting or surgery. In children ankle fractures occur in about 1 per 1000 per year.|$|R
50|$|Tingamarra was {{discovered}} in 1987, when a single tooth was found at the Murgon fossil site in south-eastern Queensland. An <b>ankle</b> <b>bone</b> and an ear bone found at Murgon may also belong to this animal.|$|R
25|$|For {{a typical}} mark time, the foot is {{raised to the}} <b>ankle</b> <b>bone</b> of the {{opposite}} leg. The toe should not come {{off the ground and}} the knee should not come out much past the still-straight leg.|$|R
50|$|Ungulates have {{developed}} specialized adaptations, {{especially in the}} areas of cranial appendages, dentition, and leg morphology including the modification of the astragalus (one of the <b>ankle</b> <b>bones</b> {{at the end of the}} lower leg) with a short, robust head.|$|R
50|$|The {{compressive}} forces {{applied to the}} foot are distributed along five rays, three medial (side of big toe) and two lateral (side of little toe). The lateral rays stretch over the cuboid bone to the heel bone and the medial rays over the three cuneiform bones and the navicular <b>bone</b> to the <b>ankle</b> <b>bone.</b> Because the <b>ankle</b> <b>bone</b> is placed over the heel bone, these rays are adjacent near the toes but overriding near the heel, and together they form the arches of the foot that are optimized to distributed {{compressive forces}} across an uneven terrain. In this context the heel thus forms the posterior point of support that together with the balls of the large and little toes {{bear the brunt of}} the loads.|$|R
5000|$|The talus ( [...] ; Latin for <b>ankle),</b> talus <b>bone,</b> astragalus , or <b>ankle</b> <b>bone</b> {{is one of}} {{the group}} of foot bones known as the tarsus. The tarsus forms {{the lower part of the}} ankle joint through its articulations with the lateral and medial malleoli of the two bones of the lower leg, the tibia and fibula. Within the tarsus, it articulates with the calcaneus below and navicular in front within the talocalcaneonavicular joint. Through these articulations, it transmits the entire weight of the body to the foot.|$|R
50|$|One piece {{patented}} {{thermoplastic materials}} {{are designed to}} mold to a player’s foot and ankle {{in order to provide}} support for the arch, inside and outside of the foot, and the <b>ankle</b> <b>bone</b> area. Heat molding of the skates can be done in a household oven.|$|R
50|$|The talus <b>bone</b> or <b>ankle</b> <b>bone</b> is {{connected}} superiorly {{to the two}} bones of the lower leg, the tibia and fibula, to form the ankle joint or talocrural joint; inferiorly, at the subtalar joint, to the calcaneus or heel bone. Together, the talus and calcaneus form the hindfoot.|$|R
5000|$|Recently, other palaeontologists [...] have {{suggested}} {{that they might be}} descendants of Asian gliriforms, and therefore related to rabbits and rodents. This relationship is based upon similarities in the shape of their tarsal (<b>ankle)</b> <b>bones.</b> In particular, arctostylopid tarsals bear a strong resemblance to the early gliroid Rhombomylus.|$|R
5000|$|... 1638 {{teeth were}} found, based on calculators {{approximately}} {{a total of}} 60 burials. A bigger portion of the teeth were either immature or milk teeth, meaning more children were buried. There were numerous wrist and <b>ankle</b> <b>bones,</b> showing that the burial method was probably a direct burial method.|$|R
50|$|He was Halifax captain for the 1952/53 season. However, {{injuries}} would curtail his season. A splintered <b>ankle</b> <b>bone</b> {{sustained in}} the second test against the touring Australian's at Swinton {{kept him out of}} the third. A broken arm in a home match against Huddersfield on Christmas Day 1952 ended his season.|$|R
50|$|The {{end of his}} racing {{career was}} {{announced}} on August 2, 2004, due to chronic bruising of his <b>ankle</b> <b>bones.</b> Smarty Jones finished his career with 8 wins and one place in nine starts, earning $2,613,155. He also earned a $5 million bonus from Oaklawn Park. His total earnings were $7,613,155.|$|R
50|$|Vallesaurus {{is a small}} drepanosaurid about 15 cm long. It is pentadactyl, {{with the}} 4th digit being longest and equal in length to the humerus. Its tarsus has a centrale, or an <b>ankle</b> <b>bone</b> which articulates with the tibia. In addition, Vallesaurus also has {{modified}} distal tarsals and metatarsals, and a clawless hallux.|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} twelve, Delaney was {{diagnosed}} with osteosarcoma, the same cancer that Canadian hero Terry Fox had. He had an above the knee amputation with the replacement of his knee with <b>ankle</b> <b>bones.</b> Formerly an active and successful multi-sport stand up athlete, he took up sledge hockey in 2010 with the Ottawa Sledgehammers.|$|R
50|$|As a {{yearling}} he injured an <b>ankle</b> <b>bone</b> severely {{enough that}} his racing future {{was put in}} doubt. However, he healed to where he could be trained and at age two he started in two races but showed little, most likely hampered by the effects of injury and a late start in developing his strength.|$|R
50|$|He {{impressed}} the team managers after getting second {{place of the}} 2011 Girobio, a smaller version of the Giro d'Italia for younger riders. The team signed him for 2012 and 2013. In December 2012, Anacona was injured in a training crash, after he collided with a dog. He suffered a broken peroneal malleolus and dislocated his <b>ankle</b> <b>bone.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mastodon {{fragments}} such {{as large}} tusks, tusk tips, ivory, <b>ankle</b> <b>bone,</b> teeth, skull, and nural spine {{have been discovered}} in the excavations. More than 13 tusks have been found at the site. Analysis of the mastodon tusk tips {{has shown that the}} mastodons used their tusks to dig up sodium-rich clay during the last great paleo-drought.|$|R
50|$|Its {{remains were}} found in Riversleigh, Queensland, Australia. P. robertbolesi is only known from a tibiotarsus (<b>ankle</b> <b>bone).</b> However, this is of most {{peculiar}} construction, allowing the leg to be swivelled backwards and sideways. The bird was thus well adapted to reaching into holes and crevices and extracting prey. The vernacular name flexiraptor was coined to reflect this ability.|$|R
5000|$|Feduccia's {{point about}} the tarsometatarsus (the {{combined}} upper foot and <b>ankle</b> <b>bone)</b> is correct, but Walker did not use this reasoning in his original paper. Walker never described the fusion of the tarsometatarsus as opposite, but rather as [...] "Only partial". Also, it is not certain that enantiornitheans had triosseal canals, since no fossil preserves this feature.|$|R
5000|$|In 1871, Pierre-Joseph van Beneden erected [...] "Phoca" [...] vitulinoides for a maxilla, atlas, sacrum, ulna, two <b>ankle</b> <b>bones,</b> and phalanx from Miocene {{deposits}} in the Antwerp region of Belgium. In later papers, he referred some additional {{material to the}} species. van Beneden interpreted [...] "P." [...] vitulinoides as a close relative of the harbor seal.|$|R
5000|$|Wright {{was placed}} on the {{transfer}} list by Gary Mills in December 2009 to [...] "freshen up" [...] his squad. A move to Stevenage Borough fell through when the player could not agree personal terms, and a chipped <b>ankle</b> <b>bone</b> and damaged ligaments suffered in February 2010 kept him out for most of what remained of the season.|$|R
5000|$|Provan {{was born}} on September 14, 1944 in Vernon, Texas, to James W. Provan Sr. and Alice Louise Provan ( [...] Furr) who shortly after his birth moved to Chicago, Illinois. At the age of 5, Provan {{contracted}} polio, which left him paralyzed below the neck. [...] Provan was in Chicago Children's Memorial hospital from age 5 to age 10. He had a ground breaking surgery, performed by Dr. Charles Peas, that removed part of his <b>ankle</b> <b>bone</b> and infused it into his spine. His <b>ankle</b> <b>bone</b> was replaced with ivory. He then moved to Texas and graduated from Irving High School in Irving, Texas, he then attended Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania where he received his BS of Political Science. He then attended the University of Texas School of Law and received his Doctorage of Jurisprudence degree. On December 19, 1974, Provan {{was admitted to the}} State Bar of Texas.|$|R
5|$|Abelisaurid hindlimbs {{were more}} typical of ceratosaurs, with the astragalus and {{calcaneum}} (upper <b>ankle</b> <b>bones)</b> fused {{to each other and}} to the tibia, forming a tibiotarsus.

There were three functional digits on the foot (the second, third, and fourth), while the first digit, or hallux, did not contact the ground.|$|R
5|$|Like other abelisaurids, the hindlimbs were stocky {{and short}} {{compared}} to body length. The tibia (lower leg bone) of Majungasaurus was even stockier {{than that of}} its relative Carnotaurus, with a prominent crest on the knee. The astragalus and calcaneum (<b>ankle</b> <b>bones)</b> were fused together, and the feet bore three functional digits, with a smaller first digit that did not contact the ground.|$|R
