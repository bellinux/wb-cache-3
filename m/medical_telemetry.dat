5000|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the WMTS, <b>medical</b> <b>telemetry</b> devices generally could be operated on an unlicensed basis on vacant television channels 7-13 (174-216 MHz) and 14-46 (470-668 MHz) or on a licensed but secondary basis to private land mobile radio operations in the 450-470 MHz frequency band. This meant that wireless <b>medical</b> <b>telemetry</b> operations had to accept interference from the primary users of these frequency bands, i.e., the television broadcasters and private land mobile radio licensees. Further, if a wireless <b>medical</b> <b>telemetry</b> operation caused interference to television or private land mobile radio transmissions, the user of the wireless <b>medical</b> <b>telemetry</b> equipment would be responsible for rectifying the problem, even if that meant shutting down the <b>medical</b> <b>telemetry</b> operation.The FCC was concerned that certain regulatory developments, including the advent of digital television (DTV) service, would result in more intensive use of these frequencies by the primary services, subjecting wireless <b>medical</b> <b>telemetry</b> operations to greater interference than before and perhaps precluding such operations entirely in many instances. To ensure that wireless <b>medical</b> <b>telemetry</b> devices can operate free of harmful interference, the FCC decided to establish the WMTS. In a Report and Order released on June 12, 2000, the FCC allocated a total of 14 megahertz of spectrum to WMTS on a primary basis. At the same time, it adopted a number of regulations to ensure that the WMTS frequencies are used effectively and efficiently for their intended medical purpose.

In this paper, a near lossless {{image compression}} algorithm based on row by row classifier with encoding schemes like Lempel Ziv Welch (LZW), Huffman and Run Length Encoding (RLE) on color images is proposed. The algorithm divides the image into three parts R, G and B, apply row by row classification on each part and result of this classification is records in the mask image. After classification the image data is decomposed into two sequences each for R, G and B and mask image is hidden in them. These sequences are encoded using different encoding schemes like LZW, Huffman and RLE. An exhaustive comparative analysis is performed to evaluate these techniques, which reveals that the proposed algorithm have smaller bits per pixel (bpp) than simple LZW, Huffman and RLE encoding techniques. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Feature sets in many domains often contain many irrelevan-t and {{redundant}} features, both {{of which}} have a negative e↵ect on the performance and complexity of agents that use the data [7]. Supervised feature selection aims to overcome this problem by selecting features that are highly related to the class labels, yet unrelated to each other. One proposed technique to select good features with few inter-dependencies is minimal Redundancy Maximal Relevance (mRMR) [10], but this can be impractical with large feature sets. In many situations, features are extracted from signal data such as vehicle <b>telemetry,</b> <b>medical</b> sensors, or financial time-series, and it is possible for feature redundancies to exist both between features extracted from the same signal (intra-signal), and between features extracted from di↵erent signals (inter-signal). We pro-pose a two stage selection process to take advantage of these di↵erent types of redundancy, considering intra-signal and inter-signal redundan-cies separately. We illustrate the process on vehicle telemetry signal data collected in a driver distraction monitoring project. We evaluate it using several machine learning algorithms: Random Forest; Näıve Bayes; and C 4. 5 Decision Tree. Our results show that this two stage process signif-icantly reduces the computation required because of inter-dependency calculations, while having little detrimental e↵ect on the performance of the feature sets produced. ...|$|R
40|$|Our {{previous}} {{study showed that}} using a power function based image contrastenhancement methods has two drawbacks. First, for extreme case type of images (suchas: backlight image, too bright and too dark images), using the power function basedimage contrast enhancement methods can not retain the detail brightness distribution ofthe original image therefore lead to distortion. Second, this method can only be done onthe image with the global contrast enhancement hence can not achieve local contrastenhanced and unable {{to meet the needs}} for Human Visual System mapping curvetherefore produce a non-smooth or distorted images phenomenon. In this study, in orderto overcome the above shortcomings of image contrast enhancement methods, wepropose a new multi-scales image enhancement method based on the Inverse HyperbolicFunction. This method has two major features: (1) a sub-processing method to achievethe local contrast enhancement; (2) an extreme case images processing method that iscapable of enhancing and retaining the details of original image. An enhanced imagecould have a great contribution for further image analysis. In recent years, computerimage analysis techniques and applications in various areas of scientific research arewidely used (such as military, <b>medical</b> and long-range <b>telemetry</b> applications such asabove). From our previous research experience in MRI study, we found that IndependentComponent Analysis (ICA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) will have a goodcontribution for image analysis. One of the main objectives of this project is to combinethe image enhancement method, Independent Component Analysis and Support VectorMachine method and develop a platform for image enhancement and analysis. Throughthe platform, we can do image enhancement to meet the Human Visual System mappingcurve and do image analysis to classify and extract useful information.

30|$|Recently, {{image fusion}} {{has been widely}} used in many fields, such as {{military}} weapons, machine vision, remote sensing <b>telemetry,</b> <b>medical</b> image processing, and automatic target recognition system. The application of image fusion in the military field is mainly focused on the target acquisition of weapons such as precision-guided missiles and unmanned attack aircraft. Because these weapons need to lock the target in the execution of strategic bombing and they have many uncertain factors in high speed flight, such as weather and obstacles, {{it is not easy}} to produce very successful photographs in one shot, so it needs to be fused to multisensory or multi-time image data to get a clearer post fusion image. The intelligent system on the weapon will interpret the image and the target image in the database which are stored in the database. If the feature information is similar, the attack launch command is executed. If the feature information is not similar, then the data will be processed. The quality of image fusion is closely related to the guidance precision of intelligent-guided weapons, and because the speed of the missile is very fast, the speed of image fusion processing is also higher. Human recognition and understanding of the target is a process of multi-source information fusion. Human vision, hearing, taste, and so on are integrated to identify a target, and then compare and match the cognitive experience of their own brain, and finally decide. For example, two eyes of human beings are equivalent to two sensors, which are fused around each other and transmit information to the central nervous system. In the development of intelligent robot technology, one of the most important aspects is machine vision, especially the principle of image fusion. In medical analysis, image fusion is also very important, for example, CT images show more of the human skeleton, while MRI images are more detailed in the details of the muscles and ligaments of the human body. The fusion of these two kinds of images will be more conducive to the accurate grasp of the patient’s condition. In the field of target recognition, image fusion is also very important, such as the fusion of color information of concentrated energy, such as the recognition of the edge, texture, and details of the target, to get a clearer recognition of the target object and so on. The application area of image fusion is also important in resource survey, landform mapping, and crop growth prediction.|$|R
