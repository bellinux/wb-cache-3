5000|$|A {{positive}} Pemberton's sign {{is indicative}} of superior vena cava syndrome (SVC), commonly {{the result of a}} mass in the mediastinum. Although the sign is most commonly described in patients with substernal goiters where the goiter “corks off” the thoracic inlet, the maneuver is potentially useful in any patient with adenopathy, tumor, or fibrosis involving the mediastinum. SVC has been observed as a result of diffuse <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> of various pathologies such as cystic fibrosis [...] and Castleman’s disease. Park et al. reported enlarged cervical lymph nodes associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis as the cause of internal jugular vein compression, which presented clinically similar to SVC syndrome.|$|E
50|$|The {{high-resolution}} {{computed tomography}} (HRCT) chest scan {{is better than}} the chest radiograph to detect cystic parenchymal disease and is almost always abnormal at the time of diagnosis, even when the chest radiograph and pulmonary function assessments are normal. The typical CT shows diffuse round, bilateral, thin-walled cysts of varying sizes ranging from 1 to 45 mm in diameter. The numbers of cysts varies in LAM from a few to almost complete replacement of normal lung tissue. The profusion of cysts tends to be milder in patients with TSC-LAM than S-LAM, perhaps explained in part because TSC-LAM patients typically receive earlier screening. Pleural effusions are seen on CT in 12% of patients with S-LAM and 6% of patients with TSC-LAM. Other CT features include linear densities (29%), hilar or <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> (9%), pneumothorax, lymphangiomyoma, and thoracic duct dilation. Ground-glass opacities (12%) suggest the presence of interstitial edema due to lymphatic congestion. In patients with TSC, nodular densities on HRCT may represent multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia (MMPH) made up of clusters of hyperplastic type II pneumocytes. MMPH may be present in males or females with TSC in {{the presence or absence of}} LAM, but not in patients with S-LAM. MMPH is not typically associated with physiologic or prognostic consequences, but one case of respiratory failure due to MMPH has been reported.|$|E

Material/Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and Sinoced were systematically searched for articles published in English or Chinese that reported the diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA in mediastinal TBLA. The quality of studies was assessed using the QualSyst tool. Using 95 % confidence intervals (CI), the diagnostic yields of EBUS-TBNA were calculated for the individual studies, {{and the results were}} then pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity and publi-cation bias were also assessed. Results: A total of 14 studies, consisting of 684 patients with mediastinal TBLA, were finally included.

His CD 4 cell count was 11 cells/μl and HIV- 1 viral load was 315, 939 copies/ml. Antituberculosis therapy was initiated after the diagnosis of pulmonary TB.

Endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a new minimally invasive test for investigating <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymphadenopathy.</b> The identification of granulomatous inflammation by EBUS-TBNA and the clinical implications of such detection {{in a series of}} patients with previously treated cancer and new <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> has not previously been performed. Methods All 153 consecutive patients undergoing EBUS-TBNA in an academic cancer institution for suspected cancer in the mediastinum (<b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> by CT imaging) were reviewed. Patients with non-caseating granuloma identified by EBUS-TBNA were included. Results EBUS-TBNA identified non-caseating granuloma in 17 / 153 (11 %) patients. A subset of 8 / 153 (5. 2 %) had sarcoid like lymphadenopathy mimicking cancer recurrence (5 / 5 PET positive). Another 8 / 153 (5. 2 %) patients with new <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> and no prior history of cancer had a clinical syndrome consistent with sarcoidosis. One other patient with a history of breast cancer was diagnosed with non-tuberculous mycobacteria infection. No patient required mediastinoscopy and there were no complications.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 75 children with tuberculosis referred to Masih Daneshvari Hospital in Tehran, Iran, from 2009 to 2013. Their medical records were investigated, and CT-scan characteristics were extracted by a radiologist. Results: Mean±standard deviation age of cases was 11. 2 ± 4. 6 years. CT-scan results indicated 94. 7 % of cases had lymphadenopathy, with lower paratracheal, upper paratracheal, hilar, and subcarinal forms observed in 81. 7 %, 69. 1 %, 53. 5 %, and 47. 9 % of cases as the most involved stations in lymph nodes, respectively. In 74. 6 % of patients with <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymphadenopathy,</b> perilymph node fat inflammation (matting) was observed, with 52. 11 % exhibiting conglomeration.

40|$|Background: Radiographic {{demonstration}} of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> {{is important for}} the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Plain radiographs are unreliable for this and CT, which is relatively more expensive and carries a high radiation burden, remains the gold standard. No studies correlating the presence of axillary with <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> have been reported. Such a correlation would allow for clinical or ultrasound diagnosis of PTB via the axilla. Objective: To correlate the presence of axillary lymphadenopathy with <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> in children with suspected PTB. Materials and methods: CT scans were performed and reviewed in 100 children (prospectively recruited) with suspected PTB. The axilla and mediastinum were reviewed separately by covering the non-relevant sections on the CT scans prior to reading. Only nodes greater than 1 cm were regarded as pathological. Results: <b>Mediastinal</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> was present in 46 % of children; 70 % had lymphadenopathy in either axilla. Bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy was identified in 47 %. Axillary lymphadenopathy showed a sensitivity of 74 % and a specificity of 33 % for the presence of mediastinal adenopathy. Bilateral axillary adenopathy had a sensitivity of 50 % and a specificity of 56 %. Conclusions: Axillary lymphadenopathy has a moderate sensitivit y and low specificity for the presence of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy in children with suspected PTB.

MethodsChest CT scans of 75 cases of pediatric tuberculosis at Masih Daneshvari Hospital in Tehran, Iran, from 2009 to 2013 were studied regarding characteristics of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>lymphadenopathy.</b> ResultsMean±standard deviation age of cases was 11. 2 ± 4. 6 years.

Most of the lymphadenopathies were located in the lower paratracheal (81. 7 %), upper paratracheal (69. 1 %), hilar (53. 5 %), and subcarinal (47. 9 %) stations. Perilymph node fatty stranding, lymphadenopathy conglomeration, bronchial pressure by the lymph nodes, and lymph node calcification were noted in 74. 6 %, 52. 11 %, 4. 23 %, and 5. 6 % of cases, respectively.
