The present study used video playbacks to test whether or not sailfin molly females copy the rejection of a male. Test females spent significantly less time with previously attractive males after having observed their rejection by other females. Eight of 15 females even reversed their choice and preferred the male they had previously found unattractive.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between marital quality and depressive symptomology has interested scholars for decades. Two prominent theories have commonly {{been used to}} inform such investigations: (1) the Stress Generation Hypothesis, which suggests that higher levels of depressive symptomology contribute to lower levels of marital quality; and (2) the Marital Discord Model of Depression, which suggests that lower levels of marital quality contribute {{to higher levels of}} depressive symptomology. It has been suggested that, when examined within a dyadic context, the Stress Generation Hypothesis may better characterize actor associations (i. e., associations between one’s own marital behavior and depressive symptomology), whereas the Marital Discord Model of Depression may better characterize partner associations (i. e., associations between one spouse’s marital behavior and the other spouse’s depressive symptomology). Thus, it may be that distressed individuals enact maladaptive marital behaviors (i. e., actor stress-generation effect) that, over time, elevate their partners’ levels of depressive symptomology (i. e., partner marital-discord effect). The main {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate this hypothesis within a sample of military couples coping with deployment-induced transitions. Because deployment-induced transitions are likely stressful, they provide a rich landscape on which to examine associations between psychological adjustment and marital quality within a dyadic context. Data for the current study came from an ongoing, longitudinal study of National Guard families. Study analyses utilized three waves of prospective interview data per couple: (1) predeployment, (2) deployment, and (3) reintegration. Participants included 154 heterosexual, married couples in which service members identified as <b>male.</b> <b>Key</b> constructs were measured with latent variables and included service members’ and significant others’ self-reported depressive symptomology at predeployment and reintegration, as well as significant others’ self-reported partner-directed coping (i. e., active engagement and minimization) during deployment. Data were analyzed within a structural equation modeling framework. Findings provided marginal support for study hypotheses. For example, prior to accounting for stability in depressive symptomology, significant others’ minimization of service members’ concerns during deployment mediated a longitudinal association between significant others’ depressive symptomology at predeployment and service members’ depressive symptomology at reintegration. In addition, significant others were more likely to minimize service members’ concerns during deployment when service members self-reported higher levels of distress at predeployment. These findings enrich our understanding of how, in the context of stressors external to marriage, individuals’ psychological well-being is related to exchanges that take place within marriage. In being guided by both the Stress Generation Hypothesis and the Marital Discord Model of Depression, study findings elucidate specific pathways through which marital quality and individual well-being are related across time and partners. Potential implications for intervention efforts aimed at bolstering couple resilience to periods of prolonged stress and transition are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{current levels}} of {{contributions}} of the livestock subsector in Ethiopia, at either the macro or micro level, is below potential. Policy, technological, organizational and institutional interventions to improve the contributions of livestock to the national economy need {{to be based on}} an understanding of the constraints and opportunities available based on sound theoretical and empirical analysis. This rapid marketing appraisal study is aimed at assessing the supply chains of live cattle and live shoats in the four Ethiopian regional states of Tigray, Amhara, Oromia and the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples region (SNNPR). Livestock production in Ethiopia is based on traditional technology and practices, and is subsistence oriented. Although efforts are being made to introduce and promote market oriented livestock production, with or without fattening, these efforts are miniscule compared with the size of the livestock population and the number of household who rear them. Hence, it is important to build on these efforts, evaluate them to learn lessons, and strengthen the extension service to promote the market orientation among the wider farming population. In most of the study areas, feed shortage was identifi ed as the most important constraint to livestock production. In some of the study areas, livestock diseases were identified as most important constraint, followed by feed shortage. Potential solutions to the feed problem vary depending on the resource bases of a particular intervention area. The relative bias of the extension service in favour of crop production has left the livestock extension service too limited. This calls for the need to invigorate the livestock extension service throughout the country. Especially, the development of market oriented livestock extension service deserves serious attention. Livestock credit supply falls short of demand in many of the study areas and some farmers complained about the periodic repayment schedule of the livestock credit. On average, there are four livestock market places per woreda. The primary markets in some of the Pilot Learning Woredas (PLWs) are fenced in which the respective municipalities charge buyers and sellers tax for sold animals upon exit. Farmers and traders in all of the study sites reported no or very little access to formal livestock marketing information. Farmers in all PLWs depend on actual market day information for prices and selling decisions. Livestock traders are almost exclusively <b>male.</b> <b>Key</b> informants indicated that there are no farmer associations or cooperatives involved in livestock marketing in the woredas, except in some areas where export abattoirs have established livestock marketing cooperatives and unions. The reasons for selling livestock, as reported by farmers, include the need to cover incidental cash expenses to fill household food defi cit gaps, buy clothing, cover school and medical fees, cover expenses for social events, down payment for credit and credit repayments, payment for labour for agricultural activities, buy other animals, and to purchase crop inputs. Forced sales due to shortage of feed and water during the dry period were also widely mentioned. The sale of male shoats dominates the sale of females. The age of shoats supplied to the markets in the eight PLWs ranges from 1 to 2 years. The most common weight of shoats offered for sale ranges between 15 to 25 kg live weight. In almost all PLWs livestock are transported mainly by trekking. Farmers and traders indicated a number of problems affecting marketing of shoats and cattle. The major ones include inadequate market places, lack of adequate supply of good condition animals, lack of holding (concentration) places, feed shortage, shortage of stock supply for fattening/reproduction, lack of market information and low price due to poor body conditions.

During this period, average total length (TL) increased from 0. 57 to 13. 18 cm. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) were first detected at 0. 68 cm TL (10 dpp). When fish reached 1. 52 cm TL (50 dpp), {{initial stages of}} ovarian differentiation were iden-tified {{by the presence of}} PGCs containing condensed chromatin and their transformation into meiotic oocytes. At 10. 23 cm TL (300 dpp), the ovaries gradually developed into oocytes in the primary yolk stages. Ovary growth was rapid after sex differentiation, but testis tissue continued to multiply without growing until fish reached 6. 97 cm TL (200 dpp), after which the production of spermatocytes, sper-matogonia, and cyst cells was apparent. Histological analysis of gonadal structure suggested a gonocho-ristic sexual development pathway. Our analysis of the sex ratio at 400 dpp showed a significantly higher proportion of <b>males.</b> <b>Key</b> words: dark-banded rockfish, gonadogenesis, sex differentiatio...|$|R

The {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) {{determine a}} reduced efficacy of serotonin (5 -HT) in inhibiting serotoninergic neurons of the {{dorsal raphe nucleus}} (DRN) because they trigger a functional desensitization of these receptors, either by 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors internalization or by the uncoupling between 5 -HT 1 A receptors and their G-proteins. In our study, we have used knock-out mice devoid of the serotonin transporter (5 -HTT –/ –) that is considered a good animal model for depression. Using patch-clamp whole-cell recordings, {{we found that the}} effect of 5 -HT 1 A agonists can be mimicked by 5 ’-guanylyl-imido-diphosphate (GppNHp; 400 µM). The 5 -HTT –/ – knock-out mutation reduced the current density induced by GppNHp in females but not in males. These data may suggest that the decreased response of 5 -HT 1 A receptors to agonists in 5 -HTT –/ – mutants reflects notably alteration in the coupling between G-proteins and GIRK channels in females but not in <b>males.</b> <b>Key</b> words: 5 -HT 1 A, GppNHp, dorsal raphe nucleus, 5 -HTT mutation...|$|R
