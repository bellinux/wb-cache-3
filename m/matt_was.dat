25|$|Butler {{had made}} it back to the National Championship {{for the second year in}} a row after losing their best player and {{eventual}} NBA star Gordon Hayward of the Utah Jazz.

500|$|It was {{not until}} 1998, however, (at {{the height of the}} {{attitude}} era) that the Hardy brothers were given full-time WWF contracts, and sent to train with former wrestler Dory Funk, Jr. The Hardy Boyz used a cruiserweight, fast-paced high flying style in their matches, often leaping from great heights to do damage to their opponents (and themselves in the process). Although Jeff was better known for his extreme moves, <b>Matt</b> <b>was</b> a prodigious high-flier himself. In 1999, while feuding with Edge and Christian, the duo briefly picked up Michael Hayes as a manager.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} the subplot of Homer's {{parenting}} originated from a real fatherhood test executive producer Sam Simon found and brought to the Simpsons studio.

[...] So for me {{there was a certain}} amount of guilt associated, like 'Do I know my son's hobby? Do I know my son's best friend?' etc." [...] The scene in which Bart welds on his racer resulted in an argument between the staff of the show and the Fox network's censors. The censors were concerned that children would imitate Bart by misusing welding tools; however, the staff was able to convince them that very few children have access to welding tools.|$|E

50|$|A little later, in {{exchange}} for performing liposuction on a super-obese death row inmate, Wesley Clovis (to ensure that the execution is successful), Sean and Christian make a deal that <b>Matt</b> <b>is</b> {{to be released from}} prison early. As the execution draws near, another inmate confronts Matt and tells him that Clovis is in fact innocent. As <b>Matt</b> <b>is</b> released in preparation for the execution, he begins to tell Sean and Christian about Clovis's innocence.

Clovis is executed and the evil and amoral <b>Matt</b> <b>is</b> released from prison.|$|R
