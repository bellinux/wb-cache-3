50|$|<b>Mangafodipir</b> (sold {{under the}} brand name Teslascan as <b>mangafodipir</b> trisodium) is a {{contrast}} agent delivered intravenously to enhance contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver.

Since reactive oxygen species are involved in ischemia-reperfusion damages, we hypothesized {{that the use of}} <b>mangafodipir</b> could prevent liver lesions in a mouse model of hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury. <b>Mangafodipir</b> (MnDPDP) was compared to ischemic preconditioning and intermittent inflow occlusion for the prevention of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury in the mouse. METHODS: Mice were subjected to 70 % hepatic ischemia (continuous ischemia) for 90 min. Thirty minutes before the ischemic period, either <b>mangafodipir</b> (10 mg/kg) or saline was injected intraperitoneally. Those experimental groups were compared with one group of mice preconditioned by 10 minutes' ischemia followed by 15 minutes' reperfusion, and one group with intermittent inflow occlusion. Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury was evaluated by measurement of serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) activity, histologic analysis of the livers, and determination of hepatocyte apoptosis (cytochrome c release, caspase 3 activity). The effect of <b>mangafodipir</b> on the survival rate of mice was studied in a model of total hepatic ischemia. RESULTS: <b>Mangafodipir</b> prevented experimental hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injuries in the mouse as indicated by a reduction in serum ASAT activity (P< 0. 01), in liver tissue damages, in markers of apoptosis (P< 0. 01), and by higher rates of survival in treated than in untreated animals (P< 0. 001). The level of protection by <b>mangafodipir</b> was similar to that observed following intermittent inflow occlusion and higher than after ischemic preconditioning.

40|$|Oxysterols are {{the major}} {{cytotoxic}} components of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) that accumulate in atherosclerotic plaques. Their uptake by macrophages ensue foam cell formation, atherogenesis and plaque progression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has grown as a modality to track such intra-plaque developments by using intracellular contrast agents. The focus {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of two contrast agents; manganese based <b>mangafodipir</b> (TeslascanTM) and iron based super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION, ResovistTM) on cell functions and examined their interaction with oxysterol laden cells. <b>Mangafodipir</b> has antioxidant property and provides protection against oxidative stress. The chemical structure of <b>mangafodipir</b> comprises of organic ligand fodipir (Dipyridoxyl diphosphate, Dp-dp) and Mn (manganese). <b>Mangafodipir</b> is readily metabolized within the body to manganese dipyridoxyl ethyldiamine (MnPLED) after an intravenous injection. MnPLED has superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic activity, and Dp-dp has iron chelating effects. The second contrast agent tested in this study is ResovistTM. These SPION are primarily ingested by macrophages and accumulated in lysosomes where they are gradually degraded ensuing increased cellular iron. In paper I, we examined whether the above-noted effects of <b>mangafodipir</b> could be utilized to prevent 7 β-hydroxycholesterol (7 βOH) induced cell death. We found that <b>mangafodipir</b> prevents 7 βOH induced cell death by attenuating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by preserving lysosomal membrane integrity and mitochondrial membrane potential. The second part of this study (paper II) was designed to identify the pharmacologically active part of <b>mangafodipir,</b> which exerts the above-noted effects. We compared the activity of parent compound (<b>mangafodipir)</b> with MnPLED and Dp-dp. We found that mangafodipir; MnPLED and Dp-dp provide similar cyto-protection against 7 βOH induced cell death. These results suggest that MnPLED and Dp-dp both contribute to the pharmacologically active part of <b>mangafodipir.</b> In paper III, we aimed to examine the interaction of SPION with monocytes and macrophages exposed or not to atheroma relevant oxysterols. We demonstrate that SPION loading up-regulates cellular levels of cathepsin and ferritin and induces membranous ferroportin expression. Additionally, SPION incites secretion of ferritin and both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, exposure to oxysterols resulted in a reduced SPION uptake by cells, which may lead to inefficient targeting of such cells. Although SPION uptake was reduced, the ingested amounts significantly up-regulated the expression of 7 βOH induced cathepsin B, cathepsin L and ferritin in cells, which may further aggravate atherogenesis. The fourth part of the study (paper IV) was designed to examine the interaction of SPION with macrophage subtypes and compare the cellular effects of coated and uncoated iron-oxide nanoparticles. We found that iron in SPION induces a phenotypic shift in THP 1 M 2 macrophages towards a macrophage subtype characterized by upregulated intracellular levels of CD 86, ferritin and cathepsin L. Differential levels of these proteins among macrophage subtypes might be important to sustain a functional plasticity. Additionally, uncoated iron-oxide nanoparticles induced dose dependent cell death in macrophages, which elucidates the potential cyto-toxicity of iron in iron-oxide nanoparticles. In conclusion, evidence is provided in this study that intracellular MRI contrast agents have the potential to modulate cell functions. The study reveals a therapeutic potential of <b>mangafodipir,</b> which could be utilized for future development of contrast agents with both diagnostic and curative potentials. Additionally, we found that surface coating in SPION may provide cell tolerance to iron toxicity by modulation of cellular iron metabolism and cell functions. Such alterations in cellular metabolism call for careful monitoring and also highlight new concepts for development of iron containing nanoparticles. A reduced uptake of SPION by atheroma relevant cells justifies development of functionalized SPION to target such cells in atherosclerotic plaques...|$|E
40|$|Daniele Regge, 1 Stefano Cirillo, 1 Annalisa Macera, 1 Giovanni Galatola 21 Radiology Unit, 2 Gastroenterology Unit, Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment, Candiolo, Turin, ItalyAbstract: <b>Mangafodipir</b> {{trisodium}} is a hepatobiliary contrast agent, {{taken up}} by the hepatocytes and largely excreted via the bile ducts. The agent increases the signal intensity of the normal liver, {{and to a lesser extent}} of the pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys and myocardium, on T 1 -weighted imaging. The increase of the signal intensity on the T 1 images allows better visualization of focal lesions, especially of those that are of non-hepatocitary origin such as metastases. For this reason the most important indication for the use of <b>mangafodipir</b> trisodium is in detecting liver metastases, especially when the information may influence therapeutic planning, which in many cases is surgical resection. New data show that this liver-specific contrast agent is accurate in detecting small lesions and in assessing the liver status following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, where other imaging techniques, such as CT and PET, fail. Other lesser indications for studies with <b>mangafodipir</b> trisodium are: in characterizing liver and pancreatic lesions; in identifying biliary leakage following bile duct and/or liver surgery; and possibly in the future in the assessment of the extent of myocardial damage.

The MnSOD mimetic activity protects healthy cells against oxidative stress-induced detrimental effects, e. g., myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy drugs.

Replacement of 4 / 5 of Mn 2 + in <b>mangafodipir</b> with Ca 2 + (resulting in calmangafodipir) stabilizes it from releasing Mn 2 + after administration, which roughly doubles renal excretion of Mn.

Three minutes after intravenous administration of secretin, post-contrast computed tomography scans were performed 40, 80, and 180 s after contrast medium injection. MR protocol included axial/coronal, thin/thick-slab, single-shot T 2 w sequences and axial/coronal T 1 w breath-hold spoiled gradient-echo images before and 30 - 40 min after intravenous infusion of manganese clipyri-doxal diphosphate.

Results: Thirty-five focal pancreatic lesions (adenocarcinoma, n = 18; focal chronic pancreatitis, It = 4; endocrine tumor, n = 6; metastasis, n = 1; cystic tumor, n = 3; indeterminate cystic lesions, n = 3) were present in 34 patients since the remaining 6 subjects showed no pathological finding.

MnDPDP at {{a dose of}} 5 mumol/kg b. w. was administered by slow i. v. infusion, and 20 - 60 min after infusion the T 1 -weighted SE and GRE sequences were repeated. Diagnostic efficacy was evaluated by {{counting the number of}} lesions and by evaluating whether more information for lesion characterisation was available in post-contrast images. Safety and tolerability were assessed by recording adverse events and infusion-related discomfort. RESULTS: Significantly more lesions were found in MnDPDP-enhanced T 1 -weighted SE and GRE images than in unenhanced images of the same sequences. More lesions were also found in these images compared with T 2 -weighted images at a level of marginal significance. More information was obtained from MnDPDP-enhanced images in 40 cases.

40|$|Oxaliplatin, in {{combination}} with 5 -fluorouracil plus folinate (or capecitabine), has increased survival substantially in stage III colorectal cancer and prolonged life in stage IV patients, but its use is compromised because of severe toxicity.

Oncologists included for years calcium and magnesium infusion as part of clinical practice for preventing CIPN.

The administration of intravenous Mn impacts its homeostatic balance {{in the human body}} and can lead to toxicity. Human Mn deficiency has been reported in patients on parenteral nutrition and in micronutrient studies. Mn toxicity has been reported through occupational (e. g. welder) and dietary overexposure and is evidenced primarily in the central nervous system, although lung, cardiac, liver, reproductive and fetal toxicity have been noted. Mn neurotoxicity results from an accumulation of the metal in brain tissue and results in a progressive disorder of the extrapyramidal system which is similar to Parkinson’s disease. In order for Mn to distribute from blood into brain tissue, it must cross either the blood–brain barrier (BBB) or the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCB). Brain import, with no evidence of export, would lead to brain Mn accumulation and neurotoxicity. The mechanism for the neurodegen-erative damage specific to select brain regions is not clearly understood. Disturbances in iron homeostasis and the valence state of Mn have been implicated as key factors in contributing to Mn toxicity. Chelation therapy with EDTA and supplementation with levodopa are the current treatment options, which are mildly and transiently efficacious. In conclusion, repeated administration of Mn, or compounds that readily release Mn, may increase the risk of Mn-induce...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{the demand}} for an {{extension}} of the range of diagnostic uses for currently available extracellular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, a new generation of tissue-specific (i. e., hepatobiliary) contrast agents have been successfully developed to enhance the performance of hepatic MRI. These agents include <b>mangafodipir</b> trisodium (formerly manganese dipyridoxal diphosphate [Mn-DPDP]), gadoxetic acid (formerly gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriaminopentaacetic acid [Gd-EOB-DTPA]), and gadolinium butylbenzyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (MS- 264). In a series of experiments in animals, the potential of these agents for noninvasive characterization of liver lesions was evaluated {{with the use of a}} comprehensive methodology. The purpose of this report was to summarize the observed imaging behaviors of these agents toward different types of cholestasis and focal liver lesions, compare the similarities or dissimilarities of these agents in their possible mechanisms of action, and discuss the clinical implications of the results of the experiments. In summary, through intravenous administration of these agents, both global and local obstructive cholestases can be identified on the postcontrast image. With certain reliability, liver tumors of different origins and grades of cellular differentiation can be detected and classified according to their contrast enhancement patterns occurring at certain postcontrast phases. The invasiveness or degree of a malignancy of the liver tumor can also be suggested by the presence or absence of a peritumoral rim sign. Such diagnostic information, otherwise only invasively achievable, may prove to be invaluable in clinical decision making. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} issues in pancreatic imaging are the detection and staging of pancreatic cancer, differentiation between cancer and focal pancreatitis, the characterization of cystic lesions {{and the search for}} neuroendocrine tumours. Magnetic resonance (MR) units (1. 5 T) with strong gradients and a phased-array torso coil should be used, making breath-hold imaging possible in order to avoid motion artifacts. Standard imaging sequences are T 1 -weighted (T 1 w) gradient recalled-echo (GRE) with and without fat saturation. For T 2 -weighted (T 2 w) imaging, axial single-shot turbo spin-echo (TSE) and coronal/oblique MR cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) pulse sequences are preferable. As contrast agents either gadolinium agents or <b>mangafodipir</b> trisodium are used. Dynamic gadolinium-enhanced T 1 w fatsat 3 D GRE images are helpful to delineate vessel infiltration by adenocarcinoma and to assess the aetiology of cystic masses. Mangafodipir-enhanced MRI {{has been found to be}} superior to helical computed tomography (CT) in the detection of small cancers and in the delineation of liver metastases. In cases of an equivocal pancreatic mass the presence of the “duct penetrating sign ” at MRCP (i. e., the duct traversing the mass) is suggestive of an inflammatory pseudotumour. Hypoattenuation due to focal fatty infiltration may mimic a tumour at CT, but in-phase and opposed-phased T 1 w imaging readily depicts the fat. Multi-detector CT has gained increasing popularity for pancreatic imaging because of the 3 D visualization of the peripancreatic vessels. However, MR imaging is excellent in the delineatio...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} whether <b>mangafodipir</b> trisodium (Mn-DPDP) - enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging surpasses dual-phase spiral computed tomography (CT) in differentiating focal liver lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-five {{patients who had}} or were suspected of having focal liver lesions were included in a multicenter study and underwent dual-phase spiral CT and enhanced MR imaging. Image interpretations performed by independent experienced radiologists were compared with the final diagnosis {{that was based on}} all available clinical information (including histopathologic findings in 77 patients) and that was determined with consensus. Differences in classifications by using either enhanced MR imaging or dual-phase spiral CT were analyzed with the McNemar test, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the diagnostic performance of enhanced MR imaging and dual-phase spiral CT. RESULTS: Lesion classification was correct in 108 (74 %) patients with enhanced MR imaging and in 83 (57 %) with dual-phase spiral CT (P =. 001). Lesions were correctly classified as either malignant or benign in 123 (85 %) patients with enhanced MR imaging and in 98 (68 %) with dual-phase spiral CT (P =. 001). Classification of lesions as either hepatocellular or nonhepatocellular was correct in 130 (90 %) patients with enhanced MR imaging and in 93 (64 %) with dual-phase spiral CT (P =. 001). These differences remained when analyses were restricted to histopathologically confirmed diagnoses. Comparison of the ROC curves illustrated that enhanced MR imaging performance surpassed that of dual-phase spiral CT. CONCLUSION: Mn-DPDP-enhanced MR imaging is superior to dual-phase spiral CT in classification of focal liver lesions. (C) RSNA, 2002...|$|E
40|$|Ischemia/reperfusion injury {{occurring}} during liver transplantation {{is mainly}} {{due to the}} generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon revascularization. Thus, delivery of antioxidant enzymes might reduce the deleterious effects of ROS and improve liver graft initial function. <b>Mangafodipir</b> trisodium (MnDPDP), a contrast agent currently used in magnetic resonance imaging of the liver, {{has been shown to}} be endowed with powerful antioxidant properties. We hypothesized that MnDPDP could have a protective effect against liver ischemia reperfusion injury when administrated to the donor prior to harvesting. Livers from Sprague Dawley rats pretreated or not with MnDPDP were harvested and subsequently preserved for 24 h in Celsior® solution at 4 °C. Organs were then perfused ex vivo for 120 min at 37 °C with Krebs Henseleit solution. In MnDPDP (5 µmol/kg) group, we observed that ATP content was significantly higher at the end of the cold preservation period relative to untreated group. After reperfusion, livers from MnDPDP-treated rats showed better tissue integrity, less hepatocellular and endothelial cell injury. This was accompanied by larger amounts of bile production and higher ATP recovery as compared to untreated livers. The protective effect of MnDPDP was associated with a significant decrease of lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis. Interestingly, MnDPDP-pretreated livers exhibited activation of Nfr 2 and HIF- 1 α pathways resulting in a higher catalase and HO- 1 activities. MnDPDP also increased total nitric oxide (NO) production which derived from higher expression of constitutive NO synthase and lower expression of inducible NO synthase. In conclusion, our results show that donor pretreatment with MnDPDP protects the rat liver graft from cold ischemia/reperfusion injury and demonstrate for the first time the potential interest of this molecule in the field of organ preservation. Since MnDPDP is safely used in liver imaging, this preservation strategy holds great promise for translation to clinical liver transplantation...|$|E
40|$|Our study {{aimed to}} assess the {{diagnostic}} capabilities of <b>mangafodipir</b> trisodium-enhanced MRI {{for the evaluation of}} pancreatic disease. Sixty-three patients suspected of having pancreatic disease underwent MRI with a 1. 5 -T device. After the acquisition of axial and coronal T 2 -weighted sequences, the MR protocol included T 1 -weighted fat-suppressed breath-hold SPGR images obtained before and 30 min after the infusion of Mn-DPDP (Teslascan). The detection of a focal pancreatic lesion and its intensity were evaluated in consensus by two observers, who also attempted to characterize each lesion as benign or malignant. The reviewers were blinded to patient identification and all clinical, laboratory and previous imaging findings. MR imaging results were correlated with surgery (n= 37), laparoscopy (n= 1), biopsy (n= 2) and imaging follow-up (n= 22). Sixty-two subjects were effectively included in our analysis because one patient was lost to follow-up; final malignant and benign diagnoses were determined in 22 (35 %) and 29 (47 %) of the patients, respectively. The level of confidence in the diagnosis of the pancreatic lesion was significantly increased by the administration of Mn-DPDP as demonstrated by ROC analysis of unenhanced and post-contrast image sets (P= 0. 009). Overall, on the basis of observers' readings, MR assessment of pancreatic disease resulted in 57 correct diagnoses (accuracy, 92 %) and five (8 %) incorrect diagnoses. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the reviewers for the detection of pancreatic lesions and for the differentiation between benign and malignant masses were 91 % (95 % CI: 84 and 98 %), 93 % (95 % CI: 86 and 99 %), 87 % (95 % CI: 79 and 95 %) and 95 % (95 % CI: 89 and 100 %), respectively. Mn-DPDP-enhanced MRI is an effective diagnostic tool for evaluating pancreatic disease...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{sensitivity}} of computerised tomography (CT) in detecting neuroendocrine liver metastases is variable and three-phase imaging is advocated. However, patients are often young and may require prolonged follow-up, thus {{a technique that}} avoids radiation exposure would be desirable. Our purpose {{was to assess the}} diagnostic performance of MRI, before and after administration of <b>mangafodipir</b> trisodium (MnDPDP), in the detection of neuroendocrine liver metastases. METHODS: Patients who had undergone single-phase or multi-phase contrast-enhanced MD-CT for neuroendocrine liver metastases were invited to have MRI. Two independent observers made quantitative measurements (number and size of lesions). All measurements were made on each available CT phase and all MRI sequences independently, and repeated after an interval to assess reproducibility. The final number of lesions was agreed on by consensus of three observers. A qualitative assessment (contrast and spatial resolution) and preferred modality were agreed on by consensus. RESULTS: 265 lesions were detected by consensus in 11 patients. Non-contrast CT was available in 4 / 11, arterial phase in 6 / 11 and portal phase in 10 / 11 patients. When compared with the consensus number of lesions, MD-CT identified 17 % on non-contrast, 44 % on arterial and 43 % on portal venous imaging. Lesion detection on MRI was 48 % on T(1) W, 52 % on T(2) W and 92 % on MnDPDP-MRI. The number of lesions detected on MnDPDP-MRI was closest to the final consensus reading (variance = 0. 994, p = 0. 0027). The reproducibility of lesion size measurements was best on MnDPDP-MRI (variance = 0. 033, p = 0. 0021). The preferred modality subjectively was MnDPDP-MRI in 9 / 11 cases and T(2) W MRI in 2 / 11. CONCLUSION: MRI is a robust technique in the demonstration of neuroendocrine liver metastases. It is highly reproducible in both detecting the number and measuring the size of lesions. We recommend T(2) W MRI and MnDPDP-MRI in detection and follow-up of neuroendocrine liver metastases...|$|E
