Each <b>Mem-ber</b> <b>State</b> of the European Union should create new services or adapt exist-ing ones according to the implementing rules derived from the INSPIRE directive. The INSPIRE Drafting Team responsible for services imple-menting rules has agreed that services should be Web Services using the SOAP protocol as messaging protocol. This paper proposes application of well-known design patterns for adaptation of INSPIRE-unconformable services. However, there are several challenges. There does not exist any methodology to make easy building wrapper services. What is more, the services provided by member states and offered at state level are not re-stricted by INSPIRE implementation rules. Nevertheless, {{the application of the}} INSPIRE implementation rules at levels below the main architec-ture level (e. g. at member state level) should decrease significantly the complexity of the development of an application architecture based on the INSPIRE infrastructure. Similarly, applying patterns to any external service, including commercial ones, should transform this service into an INSPIRE-able service that would facilitate the creation of any INSPIRE-based application...|$|E

Taking into account acquisitions as an alternative investment mode weakens the case for subsidising greenfield investment, even for a single government. Competition between <b>mem-ber</b> <b>states</b> should result in welfare losses, even more so if spillovers from the MNC’s presence exist. While our predictions {{are sensitive to the}} acquisition price, in many cases a ban on subsidies may increase welfare.

At the same time, the signing of the December 1991 Treaty on European Union determined that <b>mem-ber</b> <b>states</b> had to meet five convergence criteria for membership in the single currency union. Italy was far from meeting the Maastricht criteria, and it was clear that it would have to struggle hard to enter EMU.

40|$|As a {{free trade}} area, NAFTA {{requires}} the relatively unrestricted movement of people, goods, and services across the borders between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Although the pro-ponents of NAFTA emphasize positive economic outcomes for the three partners, the depend-ence of those outcomes on open borders inevitably brings with it the prospect of greater opportu-nities for transnational criminal activities, generally, and for narcotrafficking, in particular. Managing {{the free flow of}} goods and people while limiting the free flow of illegal substances and criminals is the central dilemma of the war on drugs in NAFTA. Cooperation between the <b>mem-ber</b> <b>states</b> differs strikingly, with smooth cooperation along the northern border between the United States and Canada and a troubling lack of cooperation along the U. S. -Mexico border. The different patterns in cooperation among policy makers and law enforcement agencies are largely attributable to mutual perceptions and nationalism in all three countries...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse EU {{response}} towards the Ebola outbreak that developed in spring and summer 2014 in Western Africa. The emphasis is put on the EU external action towards the Ebola crisis in the frame-work of the EU development policy and humanitarian aid provided by the EU while identifying the financial framework, institutional structure, key players {{and the role of}} the EU Members. It was a common endeavour of whole range of global actors, national governments and many regional or local stakeholders that led to elimination of the threat represented by the Ebola Virus Disease. The European Union traditionally empha-sized multilateral approach that is in compliance with the EU middle power capacities.

40|$|The {{negative}} spillovers {{for other}} countries that are generated by national policies or the exercise of market power imply there is significant potential to realize global welfare gains through in-ternational cooperation and negotiation of disciplines {{on the use of}} specific policies. The main multilateral institution that offers a framework for countries to pursue such cooperation is the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO embodies a set of rules that apply to the agricultural trade policies of <b>mem-ber</b> <b>states,</b> but these address only a subset of the relevant poli-cies. Compared to the historical focus of the membership on negotiating agreements to improve access to markets for export-ers, rules applying to import policies are more extensive and better developed than rules pertaining to export policies. In principle, the WTO’s framework of rules and disciplines can be applied to both types of policies—what is needed is for mem...|$|R
40|$|Electricity sector {{liberalisation}} {{is part of}} thewider {{trend toward}} liberalisation and the with-drawal of the state from involvement in infrastruc-ture industries. The electricity liberalisation in the European Union (EU) is the world’s most extensive cross-jurisdiction reform program of the sector and involves liberalisation of electricity markets in <b>mem-ber</b> <b>states</b> and integration of the national markets. The member countries include some of the world’s pioneering countries (e. g. UK, Norway) as well as slow-reforming countries (e. g. France, Greece). In {{the absence of a}} centrally driven programme, the pace of reform in the EU would have been consider-ably slower. 1 The electricity liberalisation trend in the EU is tak-ing place amid a world-wide slow down in the pace of reforms. The California electricity crises in 2000 – 01 and the 2003 blackouts in New York and parts of Europe have dampened political enthusiasm for reforms. In Latin America, political and public support for reforms is on the decline. Elsewhere, apart from some leading countries such as th...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Europe is not {{delivering}} on its Lisbon agenda {{commitment to}} increase its R&D-to-GDP ratio to three percent by 2010. This is worrying, not only because Europe seems unable to reach an objective it has publicly set itself, but mainly because in 2006 its R&D intensity was still below two percent, having flatlined {{for more than two}} decades. As far as business-funded R&D is concerned, the Chinese business sector has even outperformed European firms. The Lisbon-inspired national R&D targets are equally overambitious. The European Commission’s benchmarking of <b>mem-ber</b> <b>states</b> against the headline three percent figure is questionable because such comparisons rarely take into account the effect of industrial specialisation. For most countries, R&D intensity is a by-product of special-isation. However, Swedish and US R&D intensity is higher than their industrial structure would suggest, implying that other factors are at work, such as a large integrated technology market and a superior academic research environment...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{infectious}} disease of measles {{is becoming a}} rarity in the <b>mem-ber</b> <b>states</b> of the European Union. After {{the implementation of the}} mandatory im-munization calendar, cases of measles among children rarely encounter while those that have been registered usually pass lightly and without any signifi cant complica-tions. We present two cases of a measles-type infection with a fatal outcome for two children – 4 and 11 years of age respectively – who had not been immunized {{by the time of the}} event and who developed an unfolding clinical picture with the respective complications. In a number of countries in the European Union (as well as within some ethnical groups, the Roma population included), standard-type vaccinations may appear to be problematic. The most frequently encountered complications, re-sulting from such “blunders”, are pneumonia and encephalitis but controlling the clinical symptoms is not always possible because of: 1) late medical intervention due to the poor knowledge ability of the respective ethnical group (overdue contact with the specialized medical personnel), as well as 2) the superposed bacterial infection...|$|R
40|$|Today, several {{theoretical}} perspectives {{compete for}} {{attention in the}} debate on European integration. Thus, {{there is a need}} for empirical exploration of the various theoretical frameworks. This study uses the Intergovernmental Conference 2000 to test the usefulness of liberal intergovernmentalism and historical institutionalism. Initially the bargaining situation is considered, after which the outcome of negotiations is analyzed. The assessment indi-cates that both analytical perspectives provide valuable insights. Liberal intergovernmentalism presents assumptions about the importance of <b>mem-ber</b> <b>states</b> and the intensity of their preferences, which to a large extent are supported by the empirical evidence. The historical-institutionalist em-phasis on past events and unanticipated consequences of previous decisions is valuable in highlighting important structuring elements. Nevertheless, the theoretical frameworks are still not capable, on their own, to provide a complete understanding of the process. The liberal intergovernmentalist theory is somewhat simplified, while historical institutionalism cannot ac-count for the timing and precise contents of the reforms. A final analysis indicates that the results of the theoretical evaluation, to a large extent, are likely to be valid also for future conferences. 4 CFE Working paper series no. 20 5 EU Treaty Reform in Theoretical Perspective...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing number}} of Africans flees from their desolate {{economic}} situation or violent conflicts and political persecution at home to Europe. The European Union shares responsibil-ity for this growing economic misery, in view of its egoistic external trade policy. Neverthe-less, it intensifies the foreclosure of its external borders. Thereby, the escape routes become even more dangerous, thousands die every year. The European-African migration summits in Rabat and Tripoli in June and November 2006 even strengthened this policy of exclusion. Yet, well adapted immigration regulations would serve the interest of all parties involved. Last, but not least, it could contribute to protect the over-aged population of European <b>mem-ber</b> <b>states</b> {{in the long run}} against threatening economic decline. Even Germany and France meanwhile hesitantly accept {{the fact that they are}} an immigration country. The EU commis-sion endorses a limited and temporarily restricted immigration of Africans. However, two fundamental problems remain unsolved. Cost and benefit of immigration are distributed asymmetrically between the social classes. In addition, the EU favours the admission of high skilled labour, which tends to strengthen the 'brain drain' from Africa even more, while mil-lions of unskilled irregular migrants compete with the growing army of unemployed in the host countries. Both will aggravate the imminent danger of violent conflicts and of right-wing extremism in the immigration regions. ...|$|R
40|$|Background Organ {{donation}} after {{cardiac death}} is increas-ingly implemented, with outcomes {{similar to those}} of organ donation after brain death. Many hospitals hesitate to imple-ment a protocol for donation after cardiac death because of the potential negative reactions among health care providers. Objectives To determine the acceptance of a protocol for donation after cardiac death among multidisciplinary staff in a pediatric intensive care unit. Methods An anonymous, 15 -question, Likert-scale question-naire (scores 1 - 5) was used to determine the opinions of staff about donation after brain death and after cardiac death in a pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary-care university hospital. Results Survey response rate was 67 % (n = 60). All physi-cians, 89 % of nurses, and 82 % of the remaining staff <b>mem-bers</b> <b>stated</b> that they understood the difference between donation after brain death and donation after cardiac death; staff supported both types of donation, at rates of 90 % and 85 %, respectively. Staff perception was the same for each type of donation (ρ = 0. 82; r = 0. 92; P <. 001). The 20 staff members who provided care directly to patients who were donors after cardiac death considered such donation worth-while. However, 60 % of those providers offered suggestions to improve the established protocol for donation. Conclusions The multidisciplinary staff has accepted organ donation after cardiac death and has fully integrated this kind of donation without reported differences from their accept-ance of donation after brain death.

40|$|The World Trade Organization is in {{many ways}} similar to the {{splitting}} of the atom. Both have great potential for productivity and destruction. The limited role of the WTO is that it cannot save us from us. The WTO cannot establish new values or agendas for future trade officials. The scope and future of the WTO are limited by the vision, imagination, courage, and conscience of the trade community. The WTO’s goal and function are to remove tariff and nontariff barriers and provide a mechanism for solving disputes between <b>mem-ber</b> <b>states.</b> However, the WTO has limits. Two of the forces forming these limits are consensus and expertise. Consensus is still the watch-word for the WTO. Consensus has had a positive impact on restraining those who would turn the WTO into an economic sanctions-granting version of the United Nations, and consensus keeps the membership focused on the serious business of trade. Expertise and the recognition of the limits of the areas of expertise is another limiting force on the WTO. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was also limited in addressing many areas of the global economy or addressed them only on a piecemeal basis. The old version of the GATT created limited, a ̀ la carte agreements on government procurement and subsidies and engaged {{only a limited number of}} parties. The WTO has improved upon the GATT regime and now addresses agriculture, investment, services, and intellectual property. Not bad for only 50 years of work.

40|$|On 3 April 2014, the European Parliament {{adopted the}} revised Directive {{as well as}} the Regulation, {{published}} in the Official Journal of the EU on 27 May 2014 and now known as Directive 2014 / 56 /UE and Regulation 537 / 2014. In its new formulation, article 39 6) c. of Directive 2014 / 56 /UE amends the scope of the audit committee related to the financial reporting process. It is important to be aware of that the amendments made in the Di-rective 2014 / 56 /UE and Regulation 537 / 2014 are focused on the conse-quences for audit committees of new legislation for external auditors. These changes do not have any specific effect on the risk management and internal audit functions. The Directive 2006 / 43 (Statutory Audit Directive) repealed explicitly the Directive 84 / 253 /EEC but is still known as the 8 th Company Law Directive. It was adopted in May 2006 after 2 years of deliberation. The 8 th Company Law Directive requires certain types of organizations to be equipped with an audit committee or a body with similar functions. The description of the audit committee and its tasks is broad in scope and details are left to <b>mem-ber</b> <b>states</b> and the relevant national authorities in charge of implementing Directive 2006 / 43. The rationale behind the audit committee concept is to ensure there is a fil-ter between external auditors and operational managers, thus strengthening ethical issues and avoiding pressures and influences from both sides. This mandatory audit committee has a wider scope than just financial re-porting risks. It extends over the monitoring of the company’s risk manage-ment, internal controls and internal audit. The paper analyzes the main changes as regards, in particular, the audit committee as required by art. 41 of the Directive, and compared with the audit committee required by the Corporate Governance Code for Italian listed companies (“Codice di Autodisciplina” – Luglio 2014) ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the current state}} of knowledge about progress with the management of contaminated sites in Europe. It directly supports the EU Soil Thematic Strategy (COM(2006) 231), which identifies local soil contamination as an important issue. It presents facts, analyses, and methods on the management of Contaminated Sites, which can inform policy makers, professional practitioners, researchers, citizens and the media. The report is based on data that were collected from the National Reference Centres for Soil in 39 coun-tries belonging to the European Environment Information and Observation Network (EIO-NET) during a campaign organised by the JRC European Soil Data Centre in 2011 - 2012. The information presented in this report is based on a set of indicators which have been agreed on and used by the EIONET for more than a decade. This set of indicators contrib-utes to the Core Set Indicator “Progress in the Management of Contaminated Sites” (CSI 015) of the European Environment Agency (EEA), which is used for reporting on the State of the Environment. These indicators aim to answer the following policy-relevant questions: What is the esti-mated extent of soil contamination? How much progress has been achieved in the manage-ment and control of local soil contamination? Which sectors contribute most to soil contami-nation? What are the main contaminants affecting soil and groundwater in and around Con-taminated Sites? How much is spent on cleaning up soil contamination? How much of the public budget is used? The data request was sent to the then 32 EEA member countries (27 European Union <b>Mem-ber</b> <b>States</b> together with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey) and the seven EEA cooperating countries in the West Balkan: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Montenegro, Serbia as well as Kosovo under the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 / 99. 28 countries returned the questionnaire.

40|$|Supervisor: Professor Loïc Azoulai, European University Institute. Award date: 12 December 2013 The thesis {{addresses}} a recent development in EU administrative {{law at the}} interface between the principle of primacy of EU law and the competence of the Member States to enforce EU law. EU law obliges Member States in {{a growing number of}} directives or regulations to equip their administrative authorities with independence from the government (‘governmental inde-pendence’). On the basis of two recent decisions of the European Court of Justice concerning the independence of national data protection authorities the legal meaning of governmental independence will be elaborated. This thesis argues that there is a broader approach in EU law triggering the establishment of domestic independent administrative authorities. However, obliging Member States to decouple domestic authorities from the national government is not without consequences. In order to determine these consequences the reception of EU inde-pendence requirements in France and Germany is examined in-depth for which telecommuni-cations, data protection and statistics serve as the fields of reference. In the following, this thesis focuses on the effect within the executive of the Member States and claims that <b>Mem-ber</b> <b>States</b> lose their autonomy regarding the setting up of their internal administrative organi-sation while self-confident administrative authorities appear on the national level challenging governmental decisions: the disaggregating effect. In contrast to other analyses, this thesis provides arguments that this development is not directed to technocratic models of govern-ance, but to a more effective application and enforcement of EU law which exceeds field-specific approaches to independent institutions. Furthermore, the competence of the EU to oblige Member States to create independent domestic administrative authorities is neither constrained by the respect of the national identity (Article 4 (2) TEU) nor by the principle of institutional autonomy. However, granting independence to domestic independent administra-tive authorities combined with a re-integration to the European Commission infringes the principle of a decentralised administrative structure as laid down in Article 291 (1) TFEU...|$|R
