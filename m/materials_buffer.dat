The buffer layer provides band alignment between the CZTS and window layer and also reduces defects and interfacial strain due to the window layer [12].

However, CdS contains large amount of Cd which is toxic and also produces a large amount of wastage during the deposition processes. To avoid this problem, an environment friendly material zinc sulfide (ZnS) can also be used as an alternative buffer layer. ZnS has a higher bandgap of 3.5  eV compared to CdS which results in less absorption of low-wavelength photons. It also produces better interface with CZTS creating a potential barrier to separate the electron–hole pair [14].|$|R

However, many of the underlying physical mechanisms that dictate the behavior of OPVs remain frustratingly obscure in comparison to the well-understood physics of inorganic semiconductors. This dissertation centers around the development of new techniques to characterize the behavior of excitons in organic semiconductors, both in the bulk and at interfaces. We first examine the method of spectrally-resolved photoluminescence quenching (SR-PLQ), the most convenient and powerful current technique for measuring the exciton diffusion length (LD) of organic semiconductors, and extend it to work with optically thin films. This allows for its application to a much wider range of materials and physical systems. The second part of the dissertation presents a further extension of the method of PL quenching to characterize non-ideal interfaces, those which block or quench only a fraction of incident excitons. This is used to understand the operation of a novel fullerene:wide energy gap <b>material</b> <b>buffer</b> in OPVs. In combination with charge transport and morphological studies, it is shown that the mixed buffer shows disproportionate benefits from the two materials; blocking excitons superlinearly with wide energy gap material concentration and still conducting charges efficiently even at very small (10 %) fullerene concentration. Finally, we extend the principles of PL quenching to characterize arbitrary interfaces, including those between materials with identical energy levels but different LD and exciton lifetime, and those between materials with small (~ 20 meV) energy offsets. These techniques allow us to finally resolve the ambiguity in the spin state of the exciton which serves as the primary source of photocurrent in C 60, one of the most important materials in current efficient OPVs...|$|R
