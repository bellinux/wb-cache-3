50|$|During {{the early}} part of the 21st century, many <b>microdisplay</b> {{manufacturers}} focused on applying the technology to rear projection based High Definition Television (HDTV) systems. However, due to developments in the manufacturing process of large-panel Liquid Crystal Display Televisions (LCD TVs) and resulting drops in the cost of components, LCD based TVs matured into the more popular consumer choice. By late 2007 almost all <b>microdisplay</b> Rear Projection Television (RPTV) manufacturers had withdrawn their TVs from production.|$|E
50|$|ForthDD’s <b>microdisplays</b> and SLMs {{are based}} on a proprietary, high-speed, {{ferroelectric}} liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) platform, protected by a number of patents. For the generation of colour and greyscale, ForthDD’s <b>microdisplays</b> use a process called Time Domain Imaging (TDI™). This process involves rendering the red, green and blue colour components which make up an image sequentially over time at high speed. This happens so fast that the human visual system integrates the components into a single, full colour image. This enables the <b>microdisplays</b> to use the same pixel mirror for all three colour components, and avoids the artifacts associated with sub-pixels.|$|R

50|$|Early InGaN based µLED arrays and microdisplays were {{primarily}} passively driving. The first active driving video-capable self-emissive InGaN µLED <b>microdisplay</b> in VGA format (640 x 480 pixels, each 12 microns in size with 15 microns between them) possessing low voltage requirements was realized in 2011 via a hybrid {{complementary metal-oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) and integrated circuit (IC) hybrid assembly.|$|E

50|$|Three {{types of}} {{projection}} systems {{are used in}} projection TVs. CRT rear-projection TVs were the earliest, and while {{they were the first}} to exceed 40", they were also bulky and the picture was unclear at close range. Newer technologies include: DLP (reflective micromirror chip), LCD projectors, Laser TV and LCoS. They are capable of 1080p resolution, and examples include Sony's SXRD (Silicon X-tal Reflective Display), JVC's D-ILA (Digital Direct Drive Image Light Amplifier), and <b>MicroDisplay</b> Corporation's Liquid Fidelity.|$|E

50|$|In June 1997, DigiLens {{was founded}} by Jonathan D.
