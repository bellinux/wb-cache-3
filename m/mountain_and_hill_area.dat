40|$|High voltage {{overhead}} {{transmission lines}} are {{a type of}} infrastructure with {{a major impact on}} landscape quality. As studies have shown, it is sufficient that a pylon occupies even a modest fraction of a view to cause a marked decline in the aesthetic quality of the landscape. Few studies have tried to make a monetary quantification of the landscape damage caused by high voltage transmission power lines. Those few focused attention on urban areas. In this study, by means of a discrete choice experiment, the willingness to pay of the Italian population to eliminate the landscape impact of high voltage overhead transmission lines has been estimated for the entire national territory with reference to four different landscape contexts (protected <b>mountain</b> <b>and</b> <b>hill</b> <b>areas,</b> protected plain <b>and</b> coastal <b>areas,</b> other non-protected <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>areas,</b> non-protected plain areas). The results obtained have demonstrated that the willingness to pay per kilometre of power line eliminated is higher in the <b>mountain</b> <b>and</b> <b>hill</b> natural parks than in the other areas considered. Using a simulation with a two costs hypothesis, the research shows that the social benefit from burying high voltage power lines would exceed the costs only in limited areas of the country...|$|R

40|$|Floods {{are one of}} {{the most}} serious, common and costly natural {{disasters}} that many countries are facing. Climate change and growing urban areas have dramatically increased the frequency and the severity of flood events. This has enhanced the interest of the Scientific Community and of public institutions into creating more accurate studies regarding the delineation of possible flood <b>areas.</b> In <b>mountain</b> <b>and</b> <b>hill</b> <b>areas,</b> it is much easier to mark the flood areas even with a one-dimensional scheme, while in lowlands the accurate delimitation of flood areas becomes much more difficult requiring a more detailed description of the territory. In particular, the definition of flood areas in coastal zones is extremely difficult because of the small changes in the land surface elevation and because of the presence of manmade structures that may significantly modify flood distribution. The area of study is the Ionian coastal plain of the Basilicata region (Southern Italy) crossed by five of the six main rivers of the region (Bradano, Basento, Cavone, Agri and Sinni). This work aims to: analyze the capacity of LaserScan data for the description of coastal morphology and to model flood risk areas; define a DTM able to describe the channel and floodplain morphology working on high resolution laser altimetry data and topographic data; define the most effective strategy for the delineation of flood areas using the comparison of the one dimensional model (Hec-Ras developed by the Hydrologic Engineering Center of USACE) versus the two dimensional scheme (MIKE 21 HD by the Danish Hydraulic Institute, FLO- 2 D by O’Brien (FLO- 2 D User Manual.

40|$|Yedoma, {{consisting}} of so-called Late Pleistocene Ice Complex deposits, {{is a special}} type of permafrost formation widely distributed in Northeast Siberia, especially in the coastal lowlands of the Laptev and the East Siberian Sea {{as well as on}} the New Siberian Archipelago. Its most impressive characteristics is the supersaturation with segregated ground ice in the deposits (gravimetric ice content 40 to 250 wt %), the occurrence of huge ice wedges, and its total deposit thickness of 10 to 60 m. A wide variety of hypotheses for the genesis of these deposits were developed in the past decades. Our study, based on eight years of intensive investigations of Yedoma exposures within joint German-Russian expeditions along the Laptev Sea coast, in the Lena River Delta, and on the New Siberian Archipelago, provides the first integrated study of a wide variety of Ice Complex sequences in this region and new insights into their genesis. Yedoma sequences consist of several buried palaeo-soils of different maturity formed within a polygonal landscape. Variations in organic carbon contents (1 to 25 wt %) as well as numerous datasets of palaeo-environmental proxies reflect changing environmental conditions during the period of Yedoma formation. Based on heavy mineral analyses, the clastic sediment material mainly originated from nearby located mountain ridges or rocky hills. Accumulation of the Yedoma Suite occurred as the result of a complete transformation of the hydrological regime proved by the consistent occurrence of fluvial sand deposits below Yedoma horizons, dated between 50 to 100 ky by Optical Stimulated Luminescence and U/Th methods. The fluvial dominated hydrological regime shifted to an irregular runoff from the <b>mountain</b> <b>and</b> <b>hill</b> <b>areas</b> fed by highly a seasonal runoff from perennial snowfields. This runoff occurred over less-inclined, poorly drained plains in the Laptev Sea shelf lowland in front of the mountains. The highly seasonal runoff from these snowfields delivered clastic material from nival-eolian and proluvial processes in the mountain ridges into the alluvial plains and were a main sediment source for the Ice Complex accumulation. Additional eolian transport and reworking of the same clastic material has contributed to Yedoma formation. In these plains, the long-term formation of ice wedge polygons took place, resulting in the presence of very large ice wedges, netlike and horizontally banded cryostructures, as well as the alternating accumulation of sandy to silty runoff material, and of peaty soils in polygon depressions. The period of Yedoma formation covers the glacial, interstadial and glacial MIS 4 to MIS 2 stages of the Late Pleistocene. Numerous palaeo-ecological datasets and abiotic proxies confirm this stratigraphical order. The dated onset of Yedoma accumulation varies between the regions (ca 80 to 28 ky). The ending time of the accumulation is also different (ca. 28 to 10 ky) depending on regional conditions. The uppermost part of Yedoma is mostly covered by Holocene deposits. Parts of it, however, have been strongly degraded by extensive thermokarst during the Holocene warming...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{wind energy}} plays {{a vital role}} in the world {{renewable}} energy scenario. The modern wind turbine system has a complex and repairable components due to sophistication and centralized control. The failure characteristics of the onshore wind turbines depend on the terrain conditions. In the main <b>mountain</b> pass <b>and</b> <b>hill</b> <b>area,</b> there is a heavy uncertainty in the wind that is due to the frequent change in the direction of wind and the change in the velocity. It causes a rapid failure in the individual sub assemblies. There is a substantial need for improving the reliability in the stages of design, manufacturing, operation and maintenance. Normally the infant mortality failures are more in the onshore wind turbine and the failure rate is constant during normal operating period. It is a surprise that the failure rate has rapidly increased during normal operating period of the wind turbines placed exactly in the <b>mountain</b> pass <b>and</b> hilly area due to the high uncertainty in the wind. This paper deals with reliability analysis of major components of wind turbine system and its sub system such as rotor system, gear box, brake system, generator, hydraulic system and yaw system. This paper also investigates the reliability of wind turbines and its sub assemblies placed at Aramboly pass in India by using Weibull software as reliability tool for a grid connected 250 kW wind turbine. This analysis yields some surprising results about some sub assembly like yaw system, brake system and generator which are most unreliable...|$|R
40|$|The X-band radar {{installed}} in Turin {{was used to}} analyze extreme events. About 3 years of radar maps have been analyzed in comparisons with about 30 years of measurements made by rain gauges located in the same area. The entire monitored area was divided into 4 subareas considering the complex orography near Turin, namely the flatlands, <b>mountains,</b> <b>hills</b> <b>and</b> urban <b>areas.</b> For each subarea, the Generalized Extreme Values (GEV) distributions are estimated considering rain gauges data and X-band radar maps. Radar maps are properly processed to be comparable with rain gauges measurements considering reference areas of different size centered over each available gauge. It is shown that a limited temporal availability of X-band radar maps can be sufficient to obtain a good GEV distribution estimation, and that X-band weather radars are a good instrument to analyze extreme rain events where a dense rain gauge network is not available...|$|R
