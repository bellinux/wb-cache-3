If an NDB has a problem, e.g. {{lower than}} normal power output, failure of mains power or standby {{transmitter}} is in operation, the NDB may be programmed to transmit an extra 'PIP' (a <b>Morse</b> <b>dot),</b> to alert pilots and others that the beacon may be unreliable for navigation.|$|E
50|$|The {{transmission}} of radio messages {{had the potential}} risks of revealing the submarine's presence and direction; if decoded the content was also revealed. Submarines need to provide information, mostly in standard form (position of convoy to attack and of submarine, weather information), to their bases. Initially Morse code transmissions could be used. To inhibit detection, the duration of messages needed to be minimised; for this, Kurzsignale short-coding was used. To prevent interception, messages needed to be encrypted by the Enigma machine. To shorten transmission even further, the message could be sent by a fast machine instead of a human radio operator. For example, the Kurier system - not implemented in time - decreased the time to send a <b>Morse</b> <b>dot</b> from around 50 milliseconds for a human to 1 millisecond.|$|E

5000|$|In Morse code {{the basic}} signals are dots and dashes often verbalized as [...] "dits" [...] and [...] "dahs". According {{to the rules}} of <b>Morse</b> code. The <b>dot</b> {{duration}} is the basic unit of time measurement. The dash duration is equal to three dot durations. At a 20 word per minute (wpm) sending rate the dot duration is approximately 50 milliseconds (0.05 seconds); at faster speeds the dot duration is commensurately shorter. The reciprocal of the dot duration is known as the dotting rate. The length of the dash signal is three <b>dot</b> durations. The <b>Morse</b> code <b>dot</b> and dash signals are always separated from each other by a silent period of at least one dot duration.|$|R

5000|$|The Mark I Oboe {{was derived}} from Chain Home Low technology, {{operating}} at upper-range VHF frequencies of 1.5 metres / 200 MHz. The two stations emitted a series of pulses {{at a rate of}} about 133 per second. The pulse width could be made short or long so it was received by the aircraft as a <b>Morse</b> code <b>dot</b> or dash. The Cat station sent continuous dots if the aircraft was too close and continuous dashes if the aircraft was too far and from these the pilot could make course corrections. (The Germans used a similar method with Knickebein.) ...|$|R
2500|$|De Forest was {{convinced}} {{there was a}} great future in radiotelegraphic communication (then known as [...] "wireless telegraphy"), but Italian Guglielmo Marconi, who received his first patent in 1896, was already making impressive progress in both Europe and the United States. One drawback to Marconi's approach was his use of a coherer as a receiver, which, while providing for permanent records, was also slow (after each received <b>Morse</b> code <b>dot</b> or dash, it had to be tapped to restore operation), insensitive, and not very reliable. De Forest was determined to devise a better system, including a self-restoring detector that could receive transmissions by ear, thus making it capable of receiving weaker signals and also allowing faster Morse code sending speeds.|$|R
5000|$|Woodland {{took some}} stock market earnings, quit his {{teaching}} job {{and moved to}} his grandfather's Florida apartment. While at the beach, Woodland again considered the problem, recalling, from his Boy Scout training, how <b>Morse</b> code <b>dots</b> and dashes are used to send information electronically. He drew dots and dashes in the sand similar to the shapes used in Morse code. After pulling them downward with his fingers, producing thin lines resulting from the dots and thick lines from the dashes, {{he came up with}} the concept of a two-dimensional, linear Morse code, and after sharing it with Silver and adapting optical sound film technology, they applied for a patent on October 20, 1949, receiving [...] Classifying Apparatus and Method on October 7, 1952, covering both linear barcode and circular bulls-eye printing designs.|$|R
5000|$|The SOS {{distress}} signal is a continuous spaceless sequence of three dots, three dashes, and three <b>dots.</b> In International <b>Morse</b> Code, three <b>dots</b> form the letter S, and three dashes make the letter O, so [...] "SOS" [...] became {{an easy way}} to remember the order of the dots and dashes. In modern terminology, SOS is a Morse [...] "procedural signal" [...] or [...] "prosign", and the formal way to write it is with a bar above the letters: SOS.|$|R
5000|$|In {{both the}} April 1, 1905, German law, and the 1906 International regulations, the {{distress}} signal was specified {{as a continuous}} Morse code sequence of three-dots/three-dashes/three-dots, with no mention of any alphabetic equivalents. However, in International <b>Morse,</b> three <b>dots</b> comprise the letter S, and three dashes the letter O. It therefore soon became common {{to refer to the}} distress signal as [...] "SOS". An early report on [...] "The International Radio-Telegraphic Convention" [...] in the January 12, 1907, Electrical World stated that [...] "Vessels in distress use the special signal, SOS, repeated at short intervals." [...] (In American Morse code, which was used by many coastal ships in the United States through {{the first part of the}} twentieth century, three dashes stood for the numeral [...] "5", so in a few cases the distress signal was informally referred to as [...] "S5S".) ...|$|R
50|$|Pen-type readers {{consist of}} a light source and {{photodiode}} that are placed {{next to each other}} in the tip of a pen or wand. To read a bar code, the person holding the pen must move the tip of it across the bars at a relatively uniform speed. The photodiode measures the intensity of the light reflected back from the light source as the tip crosses each bar and space in the printed code. The photodiode generates a waveform that is used to measure the widths of the bars and spaces in the bar code. Dark bars in the bar code absorb light and white spaces reflect light so that the voltage waveform generated by the photodiode is a representation of the bar and space pattern in the bar code. This waveform is decoded by the scanner in a manner similar to the way <b>Morse</b> code <b>dots</b> and dashes are decoded.|$|R
50|$|In this technique, the {{relatively}} slow acting VOX circuitry {{is used to}} control the T/R switches. Voice-operated switch (VOX) circuitry {{is designed to be}} normally activated by human voice audio picked up by the transceiver microphone during voice communications in order to effect antenna change over at a rate no faster than the typical human voice syllabic rate or slower. VOX circuitry usually has a front panel adjustable delay {{that can be used to}} control the length of time it takes for T/R switches to operate but generally the delay adjustment range is limited to that of human voice syllables and, although automatic, is generally not fast enough to act in the short periods between <b>Morse</b> code <b>dots</b> and dashes. Receiving stations thus cannot break-in or interrupt semi break-in or VOX controlled Morse code stations in mid-symbol or mid-word, during Morse code operation because the semi break-in sending station simply cannot hear in the short durations between the Morse code signals and words or code groups.|$|R
5000|$|In practice, ranges {{were not}} sent by {{voice to the}} aircraft. Instead, a tone {{generator}} produced <b>Morse</b> code <b>dots</b> or dashes {{under the control of}} the operators. This was similar to the beam systems like Lorenz, which the UK aircrew were already familiar with using as a blind landing aid in the pre-war period. If the aircraft was too close to the station the operator would play the dot signal, and when they were too far, dashes. The two could be mixed so that as they approached the correct range, the signal would slowly turn into a steady tone. Periodically the signal would be keyed to send out a letter to indicate how far they were from the correct range, X indicating , Y , and Z [...] Likewise the Mouse station sent a series of keyed signals to indicate the approach, S to indicate the approach was starting, and then A, B, C and D as the aircraft approached.|$|R
5000|$|Project OSCAR Inc. {{started in}} 1960 {{with the radio}} amateurs from the TRW Radio Club of Redondo Beach, California, many who worked at TRW and defense industries, to {{investigate}} the possibility of putting an amateur satellite in orbit.

Mr. Projoscar at Foothill College served as the Project Manager. OSCAR-1 orbited the earth for 22 days, transmitting the “HI” greeting in <b>Morse</b> Code (4 <b>dots,</b> then 2 dots .....); Project Oscar was responsible for launching 3 other amateur radio satellites during the 1960s: OSCAR 1, OSCAR 3, and OSCAR 4.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1850s, U.S. Army Major Albert J. Myer, {{a surgeon}} by training, {{developed}} a system using {{left or right}} movements of a flag (or torch or lantern at night). Myer's system used a single flag, waved {{back and forth in}} a binary code conceptually similar to the <b>Morse</b> code of <b>dots</b> and dashes. This is sometimes called the wig-wag method of signaling, or [...] "wig-wagging". More mobile than previous means of optical telegraphy, as it only required one flag and a 6- to 8-foot platform on which to stand the signal corpsman, this code was used extensively by Signal Corps troops on both sides in the American Civil War. (Its first use in battle was by Confederate Lieutenant Edward Porter Alexander at the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Although Morse code preceded modern coded {{modulation}} techniques by {{more than}} a century, in terms of Claude Shannon's modern Information Theory, Morse code may be regarded essentially as an encoded method of signaling that simultaneously comprises both: a source code (data compression code) and a channel code (modulation code). The Morse code source code was created by Samuel Morse's assistant Alfred Vail when Vail assigned the shortest Morse code symbols to the most often occurring (English language) source symbols (alpha-numeric characters and punctuation marks), in the style of today's modern data compression codes such as the modern Information Theory based: Huffman, Arithmetic, and Lempel-Ziv-Welsh codes. Morse code symbols are variable length sequences of: dot signals, dash signals, and dot duration silent periods. Vail based his Morse code on the English language source with the shortest Morse symbol, a sequence composed of a single <b>Morse</b> code <b>dot</b> followed by a single dot duration silent period, encoding the most often used English letter [...] "E" [...] with corresponding longer sequences used for less common English letters. Besides assigning Morse code symbols to alpha-numeric and punctuation characters of the information source language symbols the early creators of Morse code also assigned additional procedural symbols to the Morse code related to page formatting of documents and to control and turn over of telegraph communication channels.|$|R
