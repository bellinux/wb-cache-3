Furthermore, certain harmless species, such as the North American common kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula) and the Central and South American <b>mussurana</b> (Clelia spp.), are proof against the venom of the crotalines which frequent the same districts, and which they are able to overpower and feed upon. The chicken snake (Spilotes pullatus) is the enemy of the Fer-de-Lance (Bothrops caribbaeus) in St. Lucia, and it is said that in their encounters, the chicken snake is invariably the victor. Repeated experiments have shown the European grass snake (Natrix natrix) not to be affected by the bite of the European adder (Vipera berus) and the European asp (Vipera aspis), this being due to the presence, in the blood of the harmless snake, of toxic principles secreted by the parotid and labial glands, and analogous to those of the venom of these vipers. Several North American species of rat snakes as well as king snakes have proven to be immune or highly resistant to the venom of rattlesnake species. The king cobra, which does prey on cobras is said to be immune to their venom.|$|E

50|$|In some regions, farmers keep <b>mussuranas</b> as pets {{in order}} to keep their living {{environment}} clear of pit vipers, which claim annually a large number of deaths of domestic animals, like cattle. In the 1930s a Brazilian plan to breed and release large numbers of <b>mussuranas</b> for the control of pit vipers was tried but didn't work. The Butantan Institute in São Paulo, which specializes in the production of antivenins, erected a statue of Clelia clelia as its symbol and a tribute to its usefulness in combating venomous snake bites. The <b>mussurana's</b> immunity to bothropic venom was studied by the Brazilian scientist Vital Brazil in the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mussuranas</b> are {{increasingly}} rare {{due to the}} disappearance of their prey and have disappeared in many habitats.|$|R
5000|$|Although <b>mussuranas</b> are rear-fanged {{and produce}} a mild venom, these snakes pose no danger to humans. Even when handled they usually do not bite. Very few envenomations have been {{reported}} {{and they were not}} fatal. http://forum.kingsnake.com/indigo/messages/5499.html ...|$|R
50|$|Like {{other species}} of <b>mussurana,</b> it is known to feed on other snakes.|$|E
50|$|Underwood's <b>mussurana</b> (Clelia errabunda) is an {{extinct species}} of snake {{formerly}} endemic to the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia. It was originally thought {{to belong to}} the species Clelia clelia. Like other species of <b>mussurana,</b> it is known to have fed on other snakes; one museum specimen is preserved in the act of swallowing a Bothrops species. Its extinction {{is believed to have been}} caused by human activity.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mussurana</b> {{is immune}} to the venom of the snakes it feeds upon, {{particularly}} the smaller Central and South American pit vipers of the genus Bothrops. It is not {{immune to the}} venom of the coral snake, though. In the absence of other snakes, the <b>mussurana</b> can feed also on small mammals. It {{has been reported that}} at least some captive specimens will accept only live snakes as prey. Its preferred habitat is dense ground-level vegetation and its habit is diurnal.|$|E
5000|$|Ophiophagy (Greek [...] "snake eating") is a {{specialized}} form of feeding or alimentary behavior of animals which hunt and eat snakes. There are ophiophagous mammals ({{such as the}} skunks and the mongooses), birds (such as snake eagles, the secretarybird, and some hawks), lizards (such as the common collared lizard), and even other snakes, such as the Central and South American <b>mussuranas</b> and the North American common kingsnake. The genus of the venomous king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) is named for this habit.|$|R
50|$|Venomous snakes {{that also}} use {{constriction}} include the <b>mussuranas</b> (ophiophagous South American mildly venomous rear-fanged colubrids which use constriction to subdue snakes including pit vipers), the {{western terrestrial garter snake}} (North American colubrid {{which is an}} inefficient constrictor and, like most Thamnophis garter snakes, mildly venomous), some species of Boiga snakes (Asian and Australian rear-fanged colubrids) including the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis), some species of Australian elapids (including some of the venomous Pseudonaja brown snakes and one Australian coral snake Simoselaps), and a few Australian colubrids.|$|R
50|$|The <b>mussurana</b> or musurana (Portuguese muçurana) is a genus (Clelia) of {{colubrid}} snakes found in Central America and South America, from Guatemala to Brazil. They specialize in ophiophagy, i.e., they attack and eat other snakes. Currently six species are recognized. They have other popular names in various countries, such as zopilota in Central America and cribo on some Caribbean islands (though {{they are not}} related to Drymarchon).|$|E
50|$|The faunal species {{reported}} {{from the park}} are the following: Maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), pampas deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), bush dog (Speothos venaticus), giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), giant armadillo (Priodontes giganteus), black howler monkey (Alouatta caraya), forest rabbit (Sylvilagus brasiliensis), Juscelinomys candangus, cavy (Galea spixii), Calhartes burrovianus urubutinga, <b>Mussurana</b> (Portuguese muçurana) and tegu (Tupinambis teguixin). Also reported are Black-tufted marmoset (Callithrix penicillata), capybara, jaguar, wild pig and puma.|$|E
50|$|Gorgona {{is famous}} for its snakes. There are three known venomous snakes {{including}} the much-feared Bothrops asper and two species of coral snake: Micrurus dumerili and Micrurus mipartitus. Several non-venomous snakes including boa constrictor, Ecuador sipo (Chironius grandisquamis), <b>mussurana</b> (Clelia clelia), blunthead tree snake (Imantodes cenchoa), banded cat-eyed snake (Leptodeira annulata), parrot snake (Leptophis ahaetulla), Boddaert's tropical racer (Mastigodryas boddaerti), brown vine snake (Oxybelis aeneus), Cope's vine snake (Oxybelis brevirostris), and centipede snake (Tantilla longifrontalis) also inhabit the island.|$|E
50|$|Many ophiophagous animals {{seem to be}} {{immune to}} the venom of the usual snakes they prey and feed upon. The {{phenomenon}} was studied in the <b>mussurana</b> by the Brazilian scientist Vital Brazil. They have antihemorrhagic and antineurotoxic antibodies in their blood. The Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) {{has been found to}} have the most resistance towards snake venom. This immunity is not acquired and has probably evolved as an adaptation to predation by venomous snakes in their habitat.|$|E
5000|$|... "Vital Brazil and his {{collaborators}} have studied several actions of the venoms, (such as) coagulant, anticoagulant, hemolytic, agglutinant, cytotoxic, proteolytic, etc. (...) The (animal) poisons contain numerous enzymes which have been isolated and studied with interest in all parts since they explain many of the symptoms and constitute interesting biochemical reagents, Vital Brazil studied also the ophiophagous serpents, such as the <b>mussurana,</b> the ophiophagous mammals, such as the skunk-like Conepatus chilensis and others, the ophiophagous birds and certain spiders. (...) His book, La défense contre l’ophidisme published in French in 1914, attained international repercussion with three editions." ...|$|E
50|$|In some regions, farmers keep ophiophagous {{animals as}} pets {{in order to}} keep their living {{environment}} clear of such snakes as cobras and pit vipers (including rattlesnakes and lanceheads) which annually claim a large number of deaths of domestic animals, such as cattle, and bites on humans. An example is tamed mongooses in India. In the 1930s a Brazilian plan to breed and release large numbers of mussuranas for the control of pit vipers was tried but didn't work. The Butantan Institute, in São Paulo, which specializes in the production of antivenoms, erected a statue of the <b>mussurana</b> Clelia clelia as its symbol and a tribute to its usefulness in combating venomous snake bites. Peafowl have been kept for millennia due to their ophiophagous habit.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mussurana</b> has {{an average}} length of 1.5 - 1.6 m, but it can grow up to 2.4 m. When young, its dorsal color is light pink, which becomes lead-blue when it is adult. The ventral color is whitish yellow. It has 10 to 15 strong teeth {{at the back of}} the mouth (opisthoglyphous teeth) which it uses to grasp the head of the {{attacked}} snake and push it into its gullet. Then it coils its body around the victim, killing it by constriction (this is the reason this species is called a pseudoboa). Ingestion of the whole body follows. The long body of the ingested snake is compressed as a wave in order to fit into the mussurana's gastrointestinal system. Mussaranas are oviparous.|$|E
