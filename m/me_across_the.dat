Nashville sportswriter Fred Russell, who entered Vanderbilt in 1924, told a story about Bomar in his {{autobiography}} Bury Me In An Old Press Box: [...] "As a freshman I had pledged Kappa Sigma fraternity, which at that time had many varsity athletes. Among them was Lynn Bomar, selected All-American end in 1923... I also had the responsibility, as a freshman, of awakening Bomar in time for him to get to classes, and at the end of the school year I did this one morning by rolling the biggest lighted firecracker I ever saw under his bed. When it exploded I feared the whole corner of the fraternity house had been blown off, and I was so scared that even Bomar in his BVD's chasing <b>me</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> street and deep into the campus couldn't catch me." ...|$|E

He {{reflects}} on an Ojibwe saying left by his bed: [...] "Sometimes I go about in pity for myself, {{and all the}} while, a great wind carries <b>me</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> sky".|$|E
2500|$|Both Murray and Richard Dreyfuss have {{confirmed}} in separate interviews {{that they did}} not get along with each other during the making of What About Bob? In addition, the film's producer Laura Ziskin recalled having a disagreement with Murray that led to him tossing her into a lake. [...] Ziskin confirmed in 2003, [...] "Bill also threatened to throw <b>me</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> parking lot and then broke my sunglasses and threw them across the parking lot. [...] I was furious and outraged at the time, but having produced a dozen movies, I can safely say it is not common behavior." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Washburn, he and Cimino {{spent three}} days {{together}} in Los Angeles at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot. The script eventually went through several drafts, evolving into a story with three distinct acts. Washburn did not interview any veterans to write The Deer Hunter nor do any research. [...] "I had a month, that was it," [...] he explains. [...] "The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! But all I {{had to do was}} watch TV. Those combat cameramen in Vietnam were out there in the field with the guys. I mean, they had stuff that you wouldn't dream of seeing about Iraq." [...] When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on The Deer Hunter who went on to produce two more of Cimino's later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, [...] "We finished, and Joann looks at <b>me</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table, and she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he'll go away. I was so tired, I didn't care. I'd been working 20 hours a day for a month. I got on the plane the next day, and I went back to Manhattan and my carpenter job." ...|$|E

6000|$|Then I {{remember}} Thorns firing doubts at <b>me</b> obliquely <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table. [...] "You can't run {{a country}} through its spoilt children," [...] he said.

60|$|Lord Roxton said nothing, but a brown {{hand was}} {{stretched}} out to <b>me</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|E
60|$|He {{bent and}} touched her hand with his lips, as Adèle leaned forward and laughed at <b>me</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a pause}} {{during which}} he looked at her, whilst the men were roughly {{dragging}} <b>me</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> hall.|$|E
60|$|I swooned away, and, as I {{sank into}} oblivion, there leapt from {{the lips of}} the {{thousands}} I had betrayed that awful roar of scorn and fury which has hunted me from my home and still haunts <b>me</b> far <b>across</b> <b>the</b> seas.|$|R

60|$|She led <b>me</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> lawn, {{along the}} same path by which I had {{followed}} her {{on the day after}} my arrival at Limmeridge.|$|E
60|$|She {{waited a}} moment, {{turned her face}} full on <b>me,</b> and {{reaching}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table, laid her hand firmly on my arm.|$|R
60|$|I had {{collapsed}} beside Dragomiroff, broken and snivelling feebly, because I had been delivered before {{my time to}} all the terrors of Judgment Day, and the Archangels of the Resurrection were hailing <b>me</b> naked <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Universe {{to the sound of}} the music of the spheres.|$|R

60|$|He {{had backed}} me around so that I {{stood in front}} of the corpse of his fellow, and then he rushed me {{suddenly}} so that I was forced back upon it, and as my heel struck it the impetus of my body flung <b>me</b> backward <b>across</b> <b>the</b> dead man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] said Huish, [...] "you give <b>me</b> your 'and <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table, and say, 'Gawd {{strike me}} dead if I don't back you up.'" ...|$|R

60|$|He made a sign, {{and the man}} who {{had held}} me withdrew his hands. I {{staggered}} forward, deprived of his support, then a crashing blow took <b>me</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> head.|$|E
