This drift was driven to the Wave Hill seam above {{the existing}} Victoria Tunnel seam workings, and once it had passed the previously <b>mined</b> <b>section</b> of the Victoria Tunnel seam a drift was then sunk to the virgin area of the Victoria Tunnel seam. No.4 Drift was a mechanised mine similar to Nos.2 & 3 drifts & was worked using similar equipment. The coal was delivered directly by conveyor belt to the new coal preparation plant where it was loaded into wagons after washing..|$|E

He announces a decision to lead the fleet to Earth, a mythical Thirteenth Tribe of humans lost to history. Unfortunately for the fleet, they are unable to properly refuel during their escape, and food supplies become heavily contaminated by radiation. So they are forced to set course for the planet Carillon, which has a substantial tylium mining operation, past the stellar Nova of Madagon. In a bold move, the fleet follows Captain Apollo's proposal of crossing a heavily <b>mined</b> <b>section</b> of space as a shortcut, which is cleared beforehand by Captain Apollo himself and two of his closest friends, fellow Colonial warriors Lt.

40|$|Coal bumps have {{presented}} serious mining {{problems in the}} U. S. throughout the 20 th Century. Fatalities and injuries have resulted when these destructive events occur at the working face. Persistent bump problems can result in abandonment of large reserves or lead to premature mine closure. Through the years, alternative techniques such as artificial supports, extraction sequencing, destressing, pillar design changes and specific pillar retreat practices have been successfully implemented to mitigate coal mine bumps. Several techniques have evolved for room-and-pillar operations that control the way the roof rock breaks, regulating {{the manner in which}} stresses are redistributed in the <b>mined</b> <b>section.</b> Special mine layouts employed in longwall mines have also proved to be successful in safely redistributing or containing excessive loadings. However, with ever increasing production rates, greater overburdens and new mining systems, the need to evolve even more effective bump control designs will continue to challenge the U. S. coal mine industry...|$|E
