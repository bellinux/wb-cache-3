40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of <b>metamitron</b> or <b>metamitron</b> plus benzyladenine as a post-bloom thinner on ‘Baronesa’ and ‘Fuji’ apples. Three experiments (rate, timing and BA combination) were conducted during two crop seasons, 2013 / 14 and 2014 / 15 at the experimental station located in Caçador, SC. Fruit set, fruit drop, yield per tree, fruit size and flowering return were assessed. The efficacy of <b>metamitron</b> was affected by time of application, and when applied at petal fall, promoted the proper adjustment of the production load of plants. Yield per plant reduces, whereas the allocation of fruits in categories of greater size increases proportionally to the increase in the <b>metamitron</b> concentration applied. However, there is excessive fruit drop with the use of high concentrations. The addition of BA to <b>metamitron</b> also promoted fruit drop; however, no difference was observed between single application of <b>metamitron</b> and BA addition. <b>Metamitron</b> shows great potential to be used as thinner for apples, since it reduces the number of fruits per tree...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Carbaryl or {{the mixture}} of {{carbaryl}} with NAA (naphthalene acetic acid) or BA (benzyladenine) are the post-bloom chemical thinners most widely used in apple thinning in Brazil. The marketing restriction of carbaryl demands new options of apple post-bloom thinners, requiring the evaluation of others compounds for this purpose. <b>Metamitron</b> {{is one of the}} substances that may be used in chemical thinning of apples. <b>Metamitron</b> was evaluated at two concentrations, alone or in mixture with BA, in ‘MaxiGala’, ‘Fuji Suprema’ and ‘Fred Hough’ apple cultivars. Applications of <b>metamitron</b> at 384 mg L- 1 and at 768 mg L- 1 in a mixture with BA, ranging from 40 mg L- 1 to 80 mg L- 1, sprayed on fruits with diameter ranging from 5 to 25 mm were compared with the standard treatment and hand thinning. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with 4 - 6 repetitions of a single plant. The variables analyzed were: fruit set (%); percentage of floral clusters with 1, 2, 3, 4 or more fruits; fruit yield (kg); average fruit fresh mass (g) and percentage of dropped fruit after thinning. <b>Metamitron</b> alone or in combination with BA reduced production per plant and significantly increased the fresh weight of fruits in all cultivars tested. <b>Metamitron</b> at 800 mg L- 1 resulted in excessive fruit thinning, especially in ‘MaxiGala’ cultivar. <b>Metamitron</b> or <b>metamitron</b> + BA have potential to compose the program of chemical thinning of apple trees to replace carbaryl...|$|E

Four treatments were tested: untreated, manual thinning, two applications of 165 ppm of <b>metamitron</b> at 8 and 12 mm and one application of 150 ppm of benzyladenine between 8 and 12 mm fruit diameter. All cultivars were sprayed on the same days. Fruit drop was counted, phytotoxicity evaluated after June drop, fruit growth rate was assessed and photosynthetic efficiency was measured. Fruit drop was higher in all cultivars with <b>metamitron</b> application than with benzyladenine (P< 0. 05). A greater growth rate in fruits treated with <b>metamitron</b> was registered, as well as, {{a positive correlation between}} the sum of the PSII efficiency and the thinning percentage (R 2 = 0. 98). A relation between the duration of the blocking effect of <b>metamitron</b> and phytotoxicity level in the trees was observed. At harvest, <b>metamitron</b> and manual thinning showed the best results in average fruit weight, in all cultivars. Despite the size improvements, the only influence in quality was observed in ‘Pink Lady®’ Brix° values. All cultivars thinned with 150 ppm benzyladenine were far from the ideal crop load for fruit size, probably due to the poor weather conditions after application, while with two times 165 ppm <b>metamitron</b> sprays had the same results as manual thinning. ‘Pink Lady®’ was the easiest cultivar to thin, with a slight over thinning effect, followed by ‘Gala’, that achieved the ideal crop load and ‘Red Delicious’ was the most difficult to thin.

40|$|Organic {{amendments}} used {{to enrich}} soils of low organic matter contents can affect sorption and movement of pesticides in soils. In this work we studied {{the effect of}} {{olive oil mill wastewater}} (OOW) soil amendment on so porosity and on leaching of the herbicides clopyralid (3, 6 -dichloropicolinic acid) and <b>metamitron</b> (4 -amino- 3 -methyl- 6 -phenyl- 1, 2, 4 -triazine- 5 (4 H) -one) in clay soil columns. OOW amendment resulted in an increase in the organic carbon content of the soils and a reduction in soil porosity, the latter confirmed by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies. MIP and SEM data showed the reduction in porosity is basically due to a reduction in large pores (radius > 0. 1 μm) and an important increase in finer pores (radius < 0. 1 μm). These changes in porosity are produced by the combined effect of the suspended and soluble organic matter and salts in the OOW and the solubilization-insolubilization of the soil carbonate minerals promoted by OOW. Soil columns were handpacked with the unamended clay soil and with the same soil which had been treated for 3 yrs with two different doses of OOW (low dose: 300 ml/m 2 a year and high dose: 600 ml/m 2 a year). Clopyralid moved more rapidly than <b>metamitron</b> in the unamended soil due to greater sorption and degradation of <b>metamitron.</b> Total amounts of clopyralid leached from the OOW, amended soils were significantly reduced (75 and 25 % for the lower and higher dose respectively) when compared with the unamended soil (100 %) whereas <b>metamitron</b> did not each at all from the amended soils. Sorption and degradation studies with soil slurry suggested this reduction may be mainly due to an increase in sorption and degradation processes in amended soils, {{as a consequence of the}} increase in the organic carbon content. However the decrease in mobility produced by OOW amendment is greater than that suggested from the sorption and degradation increases. The reduction in large size conducting pores and the increase in the small non-conducting pores, induced by OOW amendment, produce an increase in the residence nine of the herbicides in the immobile water phase, enhancing diffusion, sorption and degradation processes, thereby retarding mobility. The retarding effect was more pronounced for <b>metamitron</b> than for clopyralid due to the higher sorptivity and degradability of the former herbicide. These results suggest the possible use of the OOW or similar wastewater amendment in reducing the contamination of groundwater by pesticide drainage. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

Adsorption isotherms obtained were analysed and fitted to the logarithmic form of the Freundlich equation and adsorption coefficients K(f) calculated. Thiazafluron adsorbs on soils, soil clays and model mineral sorbents to a higher extent than the herbicide <b>metamitron</b> due to their different molecular structure. The sorption of both herbicides in clay fractions increases with decreasing solid/solution ratio. The highest K(f) value at high solid/solution ratio for both herbicides is found in a saline soil with its clay fraction predominantly composed of an altered illite mineral which behaves as a montmorillonite. Thiazafluron and <b>metamitron</b> also show the highest adsorption capacity (at low solid/solution ratio) on a predominantly montmorillonitic clay fraction of low cation exchange capacity (CEC), whereas low adsorption is found on a montmorillonitic clay fraction of high CEC. The negative influence of the clay CEC is confirmed in adsorption studies on pure clay minerals suspensions. The sorption of both herbicides by soil clays after removing organic matter (OM), shows that contribution of the colloidal OM is very low for thiazafluon, although rather important for <b>metamitron.</b> The influence of the different nature of the OM associated to the clay fractions of diverse soils is suggested. The mineral components of the soil clays, especially expandable layer silicates such as montmorillonite and a type of altered illite, are revealed to be responsible for the adsorption and hence the transport of these polar herbicides by waters in contact with soils or fine-size soil separates. Not only the relative amounts of the organic and inorganic components are important, but also the surface properties and the accessibility of the functional active groups of the herbicide molecule to those surfaces.

The sulfonylurea triflusulfuron is widely used for broad-leaved weed control in sugar beet, but may no longer be effective to control imidazolinone-tolerant volunteers when imidazolinone-tolerant oilseed rape is grown, which is due to a cross-tolerance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides. Aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate six different herbicide strategies for the control of tolerant volunteer oilseed rape. As a result, imidazolinone-tolerant oilseed rape showed a distinctive cross-resistance to triflusulfuron in the field. Mean herbicide efficacy was 14 % and was only slightly increased by combination with <b>metamitron.</b> Imidazolinone-susceptible and -tolerant oilseed rape varieties showed different response to the herbicide treatments.

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to evaluate the sorption of Ametryn, Atrazine, Simazine, Prometrine and <b>Metamitron</b> to soils from ?Mata Atlântica? at Ubatuba region (Atlantic rainforest soils), employing the batch equilibrium approach. The herbicides were weakly retained in soils with low soil organic matter (SOM) content and thus presenting high potential to water contamination. All herbicides have shown high Koc at Typic Humaquepts soil, the higher in SOM content. The sorption isotherms for the herbicides at Typic Humaquepts soil suggested specific interactions between herbicides and SOM probably with partial protonation of herbicides followed by ion-exchange processes and/or hydrogen bonding formation of hydroxyl groups on the SOM surface. 200...|$|E
40|$|Common lambsquarters, cleavers, ladysthumb {{and wild}} buckwheat, chamomile, mercury, foolsparsleey and {{volunteer}} rapes are {{only some of}} the most important weeds in fooder and sugar beets. For the control of classical weed societies farmers can fall back on a limited number of active ingredients. Generally, Phenmedipham (PMP), Desmedipham (DMP) and Ethofumesate are the basis of a spray sequence. They are complemented with other active ingredients depending on the specific weed situation. The newly formulated BELVEDERE® Extra combines the three mentioned active ingredients in an optimal ratio. Hence, the herbicide covers a very broad weed spectrum with an excellent efficacy on Common lambsquarters, cleavers, ladysthumb and wild buckwheat. BELVEDERE® EXTRA is a liquid, selective, and systemic herbicide. It is formulated as suspoemulsion so that a high efficacy is achieved while preserving a very good selectivity. The product allows for flexible control of leaf activity as an additive (e. g. OLEO FC) is appended. Ethofumesate, which is mainly effective via the roots of the plant, belongs to a different HRAC group than Phenmedipham and Desmedipham. The high concentration of 200 g/L Ethofumesate leads to an effective resistance management especially regarding Fathen and other important weeds. Since 23 rd of September 2013 BELVEDERE® extra is registered for post emergence splitting application (3 applications) against annual dicotyledonous weeds. The maximum application rate per treatment is 1, 3 L/ha. In combination with GOLTIX® TITAN® (<b>Metamitron</b> + Quinmerac) or Goltix® Gold (<b>Metamitron)</b> the weed spectrum is broadened. Basically, a timely application whose application rates are adapted to the location is essential for a good efficacy of beet herbicides...|$|E
40|$|In {{the years}} 1975 - 1980, on the Experimental Farm Chylice {{fields of the}} Warsaw Agricultural University, {{herbicide}} activity was evaluated on commonly appearing weed species in sugar beet cultivation. The most frequent weeds were: Chenopodium album, Echinochloa crus-galli, Polygonum convolvulus and Polygonum lapatifolium. Preemergence use of chloridazon and furthermore postemergence use of phenmedipham were most effective in control. Metolachlor or bentiocarb mixed with <b>metamitron</b> and chloridazon were effective too. It was found that 70 % control of Chenopodium album increased crops of sugar beets by about 25 % {{on the basis of}} two years experiments (1979 - 1980), differing in quantity and periods of rainfall, a visible dependence of herbicide effectiveness on climatic conditions was demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mobile genetic {{elements}} (MGEs) like plasmids and transposons {{are often}} carriers of catabolic gene functions or antibiotic resistances. Therefore {{they represent a}} good target for metagenomic exploration of industrial desirable enzyme functions. Our aim is to increase metagenomic hit ratios through thorough environmental screening and selective targeting of MGEs in the metagenome. This work focused on the broad range IncP- 1 plasmids and IS 1071 composite transposons which often harbor xenobiotic catabolic genes and seem to {{play a key role}} in the adaptation of bacterial communities to degrade xenobiotic organic compounds. Whether the presence of specific recalcitrant compounds in an environment is correlated with the abundance of MGEs and its xenobiotic degradation capacity has not been studied. Therefore, we examined the prevalence of IncP- 1 plasmids and IS 1071 in different polluted environments. The ecosystems included material artificially polluted with pesticides in lab microcosms experiments, farm yard biopurification systems treating pesticide polluted wastewater, a woodland soil, a PAH contaminated soil and a Zn contaminated soil. Moreover, degradation capabilities of certain pesticides were evaluated in selected ecosystems. Material & Methods: The IncP- 1 trfA gene and the IS 1071 gene tnpA were amplified and amplicons were Southern hybridized with trfA or tnpA probes. MGE-content was quantified with qPCR targeting the IncP- 1 gene korB gene and the IS 1071 tnpA gene. Gene copy numbers were normalized to the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene copy number. 92   Samples from selected ecosystems were suspended in minimal media containing either 14 C-labeled atrazine, linuron, or <b>metamitron</b> and mineralization was followed based on cumulative 14 CO 2 production. Key Results: The microcosm data show that both IncP- 1 and IS 1071 increased in number after addition of pesticides. IS 1071 is found in high contents in all other environments including non-contaminated ecosystems. IncP- 1 on the other hand seems more associated with organic polluted ecosystems. Most biopurification systems were able to mineralize both linuron and <b>metamitron,</b> only one was able to mineralize the three pesticides. Mineralization of the easily degradable <b>metamitron</b> was observed in most samples even in the Zn polluted soil but not in the woodland soil and in pristine biopurification system material. Overall, non-organic xenobiotic polluted ecosystems showed less capacity to mineralize pesticides than organic xenobiotic polluted ecosystems. Conclusions: Higher contents of IncP- 1 and IS 1071 are found in samples exposed to high concentrations of pesticides. Environmental samples capable of degrading chloroaromatics show high IncP- 1 and IS 1071 contents. Prevalence of IS 1071 is more general than first presumed. Probably other gene functions besides xenobiotic catabolic genes are transferred by IS 1071 elements. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{chemical}} components of cork in the sorption of several pesticides has been investigated. For this purpose raw cork and three cork extracted fractions (i. e. cork free of aliphatic extractives, cork free of all extractives and cork free of all extractives and suberin) {{were used as}} sorbent of three ionic pesticides (propazine, 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2, 4 -D) and alachlor) and five non-ionic pesticides (chlor-pyrifos, isoproturon, <b>metamitron,</b> methomyl and oxamyl) with a logK(ow) within the range - 0. 47 to 4. 92. The effect of cations on the ionic pesticides, propazine and 2, 4 -D sorption was also analyzed. Results indicated that the highest yields were obtained for chlorpyrifos and alachlor sorption onto raw cork (> 55 %). After removal of aliphatic extractives sorption of all pesticides increased that ranged from 3 % for propazine to 31 % for alachlor. In contrast, removal of phenolic extractives caused a sorption decrease. Low sorption yields were obtained for hydrophobic pesticides such as <b>metamitron,</b> oxamyl and methomyl (< 11 %) by using all cork fractions and extremely low when using raw cork (< 1 %). FTIR analysis was useful to indicate that lignin moieties were the main components involved on the sorption process. Modelling calculations evidenced that pi-stacking interactions with the aromatic groups of lignin {{play a major role}} in determining the adsorption properties of cork toward aromatic pesticides. Results presented in this paper gain insights into the cork affinities for pesticides and the interactions involved in the sorption process and also enables to envisage sorption affinity of cork for other organic pollutantsThis research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation as part of the projects CTM 2010 - 15185 and CTM 2012 - 37215 -C 02 - 0...|$|E
40|$|The {{fungicide}} fluazinam, the insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin, and the herbicides asulam and <b>metamitron</b> {{were applied}} to indoor freshwater microcosms (water volume approximately 0. 6 m 3). The treatment regime {{was based on a}} realistic application scenario in tulip cultivation. Concentrations of each pesticide were equal to 0 %, 0. 2 %, 0. 5 %, 2 %, and 5 % spray drift emission of label-recommended rates. Contribution of compounds to the toxicity of the pesticide package was established by expressing their concentrations as fractions of toxic units. The fate of the compounds in the water, and responses of phytoplankton, zooplankton, periphyton, macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, decomposition, and water quality were followed for 13 weeks. The half-lives of lambda-cyhalothrin, <b>metamitron,</b> and fluazinam were 1 to 2 d; that of asulam was > 30 d. No consistent effects could be demonstrated for the 0. 2 % treatment regime that was therefore considered the no-observed-effect concentrationcommunity (NOEC). The macroinvertebrate populations of Gammarus pulex, Asellus aquaticus, and Proasellus meridianus were the most sensitive end points, followed by species of copepods and cladocerans. Responses mainly were due to lambda-cyhalothrin. The 0. 5 % treatment regime resulted in short-term effects. Pronounced effects were observed at the 2 % and 5 % treatment levels. At the end of the experiment, the macrophyte biomass that consisted of Elodea nuttallii, showed a decline at the two highest treatment levels, asulam being the causal factor (NOEC: 0. 5 % treatment level). Primary production was reduced at the 5 % treatment level only. In our experiment, the first-tier risk assessment procedure for individual compounds was adequate for protecting sensitive populations exposed to realistic combinations of pesticides. Spray drift reduction measures seem to be efficient in protecting aquatic ecosystems in agricultural areas...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{data on the}} {{metabolism}} {{of pesticides}} in plants is required for registration, therefore several in vitro systems {{have been developed to}} generate and identify a broad spectrum of possible metabolites. Therefore transgenic plant cell cultures with the human isoenzymes CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2 were established for an oxidative metabolic profiling of pesticides. The cDNA of human P 450 (CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2) was introduced into tobacco cells (N. tabacum L.) by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. For the screening of the transgenic calli an in vivo 7 ?Ethoxycoumarin O-de-ethylation (ECOD) -assay was established, which was performed with intact plant cells. The ECOD activity was measured as the concentration of non-metabolised 7 ?ethoxycoumarin remaining in the media. The developing transgenic calli or transgenic suspension cultures were characterised regarding their ECOD-activity. Expression of the P 450 genes was further examined by PCR and western blotting. For metabolism studies in the transgenic tobacco cell cultures 14 C-labelled atrazine, <b>metamitron</b> and dimethoat were used as model substances. The herbicide atrazine was metabolised by oxidative N-Dealkylation. The conversion rate was considerably higher in the transformed cell cultures (CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2) than in non-transformed cell culture. However, CYP 1 A 2 exhibited a higher conversion rate than CYP 1 A 1. In a time-course study the enzyme CYP 1 A 2 catalysed predominately N-deethylation whereas the enzyme CYP 1 A 1 catalysed predominately the N-deisopropylation. In experiments with a constant amount of CYP 1 A 2 plant cell culture the originally used concentration of atrazine was raised up to a 20 fold quantity. In these large-scale experiments the high activity of the transgenic clones was demonstrated. Metabolism studies with the herbicide <b>metamitron</b> demonstrated that the arylhydroxylation and the previous desamination both can be catalysed by the isoenzymes CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2. The conversion rate was considerably higher in the transformed cell cultures (CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2) than in non-transformed cell culture. However, CYP 1 A 2 exhibited a higher conversion rate than CYP 1 A 1. In a time-course study using a CYP 1 A 2 cell culture the transformation of <b>metamitron</b> could be demonstrated, starting with the formation of the metabolite desaminometamitron, followed by 4 ?hydroxydesaminometamitron and ended with the glucosid of the later. In experiments with a constant amount of CYP 1 A 2 plant cell culture the originally used concentration of <b>metamitron</b> was raised up to a 20 fold quantity. In these large-scale experiments the relative metabolic profile had changed slightly. This was due to the slower glucosylation compared to P 450 -oxidation. Therefore a high P 450 activity of the transgenic clones was demonstrated. The third substance used was the insecticide dimethoate with three potential P 450 reaction centres present in this molecule. The three reactions are the desulfuration, N-demethylation and O-demethylation. Nevertheless, {{there was no evidence that}} dimethoat was a suitable substrate for the two P 450 isoenzymes. Only a slight increase in the conversion rate of dimethoate could be found by the CYP 1 A 2 enzyme which was attributed to the O-demethylation. Finally the metabolism of dimethoate was tested in liver microsomes of rats, which were prior induced with Aroclor 1254 to increase the P 450 enzyme activity. On the basis of the obtained results it is obvious, that dimethoate is not metabolised by P 450 -isoenzymes in rats. Plant cell cultures in which the appropriate P 450 cDNAs are introduced, appear to be suitable in vitro systems in order to produce large quantities of primary oxidised pesticide metabolites...|$|E
