5000|$|Recently, {{the term}} [...] "organic" [...] {{has come to}} imply {{products}} used in organic farming. Under this definition, an organic herbicide is {{one that can be}} used in a farming enterprise that has been classified as organic. Depending on the application, they may be less effective than synthetic herbicides and are generally used along with cultural and <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> practices.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{no major}} pests or {{diseases}} affect chia production. Essential oils in chia leaves have repellant properties against insects, making it suitable for organic cultivation. Virus infections, however, possibly transmitted by white flies may occur. Weeds may present {{a problem in}} early development of the chia crop until its canopy closes, but because chia is sensitive to most commonly used herbicides, <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> is preferred.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{widespread}} use of chemical herbicides, cultural controls, such as altering soil pH, salinity, or fertility levels, were used to <b>control</b> <b>weeds.</b> <b>Mechanical</b> <b>control</b> (including tillage) was also (and still is) used to <b>control</b> <b>weeds.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Farmbot Genesis {{can perform}} almost all {{processes}} prior to harvesting including sowing, <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> and watering. It requires electricity, an internet connection and water supply which be provided using off grid solutions including a water barrel to collect rain and a solar panel and battery to provide electricity. The FarmBot Genesis {{is able to}} gather data {{to take into account}} factors such as age of the plant and local weather conditions from both local sensors and external data from the internet.|$|E
50|$|The evening {{primrose}} prefers sunny, and arid places with loamy soil and occurs below 700 meters above sea level. One important prerequisite {{is to meet}} adequate nitrogen requirements. While too high nitrogen levels {{could lead to a}} quality and quantity decline of the oil content in the seeds, moderate nitrogen levels lead to increased seed quality and quantity. Since the {{evening primrose}} is a light-dependent germinator {{it is important that the}} seeds are not planted too deep into the soil (0,5-1,0 cm deep). The cultivation of evening primrose is thus suitable for no-till farming, but the plants require an intense <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control.</b> The tiny seeds (thousand kernel weight: 0,3 -0,7 g) need approximately two to three weeks to germinate and are therefore very susceptible to the outgrowth of weeds.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> is any {{physical}} activity that inhibits unwanted plant growth. Mechanical, or manual, weed control techniques manage weed populations through physical methods that remove, injure, kill, or make the growing conditions unfavorable. Some {{of these methods}} cause direct damage to the weeds through complete removal or causing a lethal injury. Other techniques may alter the growing environment by eliminating light, increasing {{the temperature of the}} soil, or depriving the plant of carbon dioxide or oxygen. [...] Mechanical control techniques can be either selective or non-selective. A selective method has very little impact on non-target plants where as a non-selective method affects the entire area that is being treated. If mechanical control methods are applied at the optimal time and intensity, some weed species may be controlled or even eradicated.|$|E

50|$|The plastic mulch {{covering}} the soil decreases the crusting effect {{of rain and}} sunlight. The reduction in weed quantity means a decreased need for <b>mechanical</b> cultivation. <b>Weed</b> <b>control</b> between beds of plastic can be done using directly applied herbicides and through mechanical means. The soil underneath the plastic mulch stays loose and well aerated. This increases the amount of oxygen in the soil and aids in microbial activity.|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in winter wheat grown under organic conditions in Denmark on fields with different weed pressure. The treatments were sowing strategy (normal sowing time, late sowing and false seedbed), row distance (12 cm and 24 cm row distance) and weed control method (untreated, <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> (weed harrowing at 12 cm supplemented with row hoeing at 24 cm), and herbicide weed control). Weed biomass was largest at the normal sowing time and was reduced by mechanical or chemical weed control. Row distance alone did not generally influence weed biomass, but <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> reduced weed biomass at a row distance of 24 cm. Normal sowing time gave rise to about 10 % higher yield. The effect of weed control on yield was dependent on the weed pressure. At low weed pressure, <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> caused a yield decrease of 11 % compared to untreated or herbicide. At intermediate weed pressure there were no differences, whereas at high weed pressure, <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> caused a 15 % and no weed control a 25 % yield decrease compared to herbicide treatment. False seedbed can contribute to {{a decrease in the}} soil seed reserve...|$|E
40|$|Three field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in organically grown winter wheat in Denmark. The treatments were sowing time (normal or late sowing) and false seedbed, row width (12 cm and 24 cm) and weed control method (untreated, <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> (weed harrowing at 12 cm supplemented with inter-row hoeing at 24 cm), and herbicide weed control). Weed biomass in mid-summer was greatest on plots sown at the normal sowing time (compared to delayed sowing) and was reduced by mechanical or chemical weed control (compared with untreated plots). Row width alone had no influence on weed biomass, but in the experiment with high weed pressure, the more intensive <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> used at a row width of 24 cm reduced weed biomass. Normal sowing time tended to give higher yields, but this was only statistically significant {{in one of the}} three experiments. Wide rows gave a yield decrease in the experiment with low weed pressure. The effect of weed control on yield was dependent on the weed pressure. At low weed pressure, <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> caused a yield decrease compared to untreated or herbicide treated. At intermediate weed levels there were no differences, whereas at high weed pressure, <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> and herbicide treatment caused a yield increase compared to untreated.

40|$|Soil {{quality in}} Mediterranean {{conventional}} and organic stockless arable systems {{was assessed by}} a multidisciplinary approach. At {{the end of the}} first cycle of a 5 -year crop rotation (2002 – 2006) in the Mediterranean Arable Systems Comparison Trial (MASCOT) long-term experiment, the effects of organic and conventional management systems were evaluated by using soil chemical, biochemical and biological parameters. Chemical and biochemical parameters linked to soil C cycle, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and microarthropod communities were analysed according to a comparative approach. Results suggested a higher soil carbon sequestration in the organic respect to the conventional system, as shown by the values of total organic C (9. 5 and 7. 8 g kg 1, for organic and conventional system, respectively) and potentially mineralisable C (277 and 254 mg kg 1, for organic and conventional system, respectively). AMF population, AMF root colonisation and diversity of microarthropod population were slightly influenced by management system. On the other hand, mites/collembolans ratio was higher in conventionally than in organically managed soil (2. 67 and 1. 30, respectively), indicating as organic managed soils were more disturbed than conventional ones, probably as the consequence of the more frequent soil tillage performed for <b>mechanical</b> <b>weeds</b> <b>control.</b> The overall results demonstrated that, even in the short-term, the implementation of organically managed stockless systems in Mediterranean areas determined significant changes of some attributes for soil quality evaluatio...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the possibility of chemical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> strategies in soybean. Soybean field experiments were carried out in 2013 and 2014 in Southern Germany. Five treatments including common herbicide mixtures and four <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> treatments, implementing a harrow and a hoe, were tested at different locations. In the herbicide experiments two treatments were applied by PRE emergence herbicides (metribuzin, clomazone, dimethenamid and metribuzin, flufenacet, clomazone) and another two treatments were sprayed {{with a combination of}} PRE + POST emergence herbicides (metribuzin, flufenacet, thifensulfuron and pendimethalin, thifensulfuron, bentazone, cycloxydim). Furthermore, a POST herbicide treatment was implemented (thifensulfuron, bentazone, thifensulfuron and fluazifop-P-butyl). In the <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> experiments, treatments were: three times hoeing, PRE emergence harrowing plus three times hoeing, hoeing and harrowing in rotation or three times harrowing. In both experiments an untreated control was included. A 90 % weed control efficacy and 23 % yield increase was observed in the POST herbicide treatment. PRE + POST treatments resulted in 92 % to 99 % weed control efficiency and 15 % yield increase compared to the untreated control. In the <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> experiments the combination of PRE emergence harrowing and POST emergence hoeing resulted in 82 % weed control efficiency and 34 % higher yield compared to the untreated control. Less weed control efficiency (72 %) was observed in the harrow treatment, leading to 20 % higher yield compared to the control. The suitability of both strategies for implementation in “Integrated Weed Management” has been investigated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{overview}} {{of a decision}} support system for growing malting barley without use of pesticides is given.

40|$|In {{conventional}} {{seed production}} of grasses and clover it is recognised that a low plant density in the seed crop stimulates the reproductive development and hence increase seed yield. Most temperate forage species of grasses and white clover establish slowly {{and have a}} relatively poor ground cover, which limits the competition against weeds. In order to optimise quality and yield in organic grass and clover seed production alternative establishment methods have been identified. These methods enhance crop competitiveness against weeds and allow for <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control.</b> Establishing the under sown seed crop right between the cereal cover crop row provides a higher ground cover, and the establishment rate of the seed crop is enhanced. This method of establishment is recommended when weed density is low or where the prevailing weeds produce seeds that can {{be separated from the}} harvested grass or clover seed. Establishing the under sown seed crop in the cereal row allows for different strategies of <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> and our results show that perennial ryegrass tolerates a range of strategies of <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> including up to three harrowings. However, grass and clover species with a low seed weight and/or a slow establishment rate might not establish successfully when sown in the cereal row.
