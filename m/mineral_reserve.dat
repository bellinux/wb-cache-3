50|$|Mining {{engineers}} {{are involved in}} the mineral discovery stage by working with geologists to identify a <b>mineral</b> <b>reserve.</b> The first step in discovering an ore body is to determine what minerals to test for. Geologists and engineers drill core samples and conduct surface surveys searching for specific compounds and ores. For example, a mining engineer and geologist may target metallic ores such as galena for lead or chalcopyrite for copper. A mining engineer may also search for a non-metal such as phosphate, quartz, or coal.|$|E

50|$|Since its {{discovery}} in 1975 and until its re{{discovery in}} 2012, only one male specimen was available, even after several expeditions in Dinagat.

50|$|The {{technical}} information required in a Reserve declaration under the NI 43-101 exceeds {{that within the}} JORC Code, primarily by stipulating that certain geological parameters of the <b>mineral</b> <b>reserve</b> must be presented within a report, published in full, and presented in a particular way. Conversely, JORC Compliant technical reports are not commonly published in full upon the Australian Stock Exchange as this is not required by Australian regulatory authorities.

50|$|The mining {{industry}} of Guinea was developed during colonial rule, {{resulting in the}} improvement of the economic situation in the country. The minerals extracted consisted of iron, gold, diamond, and bauxite. Guinea ranks first in the world in bauxite reserves and 6th in the extraction of high-grade bauxite, the aluminium ore. The {{mining industry}} and exports of mining products accounted for 17% of Guinea’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010. Mining accounts for over 50% of exports.

40|$|We explore {{why some}} {{firms in the}} {{extractive}} industries disclose <b>mineral</b> <b>reserve</b> quantum in their annual reports and others do not. We propose that the firms' reserve disclosure policies are {{a function of the}} extent of information asymmetries, as well as information production, litigation and proprietary costs. More specifically, we propose that a firm's decisions to disclose reserves in the annual report are a function of the stage of the firm's operations, use of project financing, and the cost of measuring reserves. Empirical tests are confirmatory...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Deposit {{reserves}} {{have a role}} {{in regulating}} the development and utilization of mineral resources. Its core is to secure the supply of mineral resources by selecting the right sequence and optimizing the layout of mineral resources E&D. This paper devised a measuring model for the deposit reserves. Following the principle of “store up in bumper years to be in ready for hard ones”, and considering the particularities of deposit reserves. We concluded that: For the advantage of mineral resources, regulating reserve can realize resource advantage to economic advantage, therefore the reserve object should focus on mining right reserves. Finally, we incorporated three recommendations for the nation’s effort in deposit reserves: make special plans for deposit reserves, establish an organizing and leading body for deposit reserves and structure a <b>mineral</b> <b>reserve</b> system...|$|E
