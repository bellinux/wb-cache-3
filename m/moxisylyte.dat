50|$|<b>Moxisylyte,</b> {{also known}} as thymoxamine, is a drug used in urology for the {{treatment}} of erectile dysfunction. It is an α1-adrenergic antagonist.In the United Kingdom, Moxisylte is marketed as Opilon (Archimedes Pharma UK Ltd) and is used for the short-term treatment of primary Reynaud's syndrome. This is a condition where the fingers and toes become discoloured and is triggered by responses to cold, or emotional distress. Opilon tablets help by improving blood circulation to the extremities.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The "esterase-like activity" {{of human}} serum albumin (HSA) is {{described}} in the literature, but a contamination of commercially available HSA preparations by plasma cholinesterase is conceivable in some cases. The {{purpose of the present}} work was to examine this hypothesis. METHODS: The hydrolytic activity of HSA and its inhibition by physostigmine were measured fluorimetrically by monitoring the hydrolysis of the ester substrate <b>moxisylyte.</b> Affinity chromatography was used to separate cholinesterase and HSA. The cholinesterase activity in the eluted fractions was assessed using Ellman's reagent and butyrylthiocholine as substrate. RESULTS: A significant variation in the esterase-like activity of different albumin batches was observed. This activity was strongly inhibited by physostigmine, a well-known inhibitor of cholinesterase. Affinity chromatography led to a complete separation between HSA and the esterase activity, which was found exclusively in the cholinesterase fraction. CONCLUSIONS: The apparent esterase-like activity of HSA toward <b>moxisylyte</b> and butyrylthiocholine was due to a contamination by cholinesterase. With these substrates, HSA showed a total lack of esterase-like activity...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} which vasoactive {{agents have}} synergistic {{effects on the}} cavernosal smooth muscles of rabbits and rats when the agents are combined with sildenafil. Materials and methods Relaxation responses of cavernosal smooth muscle to single agents (phentolamine, <b>moxisylyte,</b> sodium nitroprusside, forskolin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, VIP, papaverine and sildenafil) in the rabbit, and prostaglandin-E 1 and sildenafil in the rat, and to combinations of each agent plus sildenafil, were assessed in vitro. The response to sildenafil of the rabbit strips with and without incubation with l-arginine (1 mmol/L) for 20 min was also evaluated. The effective concentrations for a half-maximal response of single agents and combination solutions were compared. Results All single agents induced concentration-dependent relaxation of the rabbit and rat cavernosal smooth muscles. There was significant synergism on rabbit cavernosal smooth muscle when the sildenafil was combined with forskolin, sodium nitroprusside, VIP or phentolamine. There was also significant synergism with sildenafil plus prostaglandin-E 1 in rat cavernosal muscles. There were no synergistic effects of combinations of sildenafil plus <b>moxisylyte,</b> papaverine or l-arginine. Conclusions These results suggest potentially effective combined therapies of sildenafil and intraurethral or intracavernosal prostaglandin-E 1, intracavernosal forskolin or VIP, or oral phentolamine for patients with erectile dysfunction who have no success after monotherapy with these agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} electroacupuncture (Ea) on circulatory {{dynamics}} were investigated in anesthetized rats. The arterial blood pressure (BP) {{and the heart}} rate (HR) in response to Ea stimulations at the Tsusanli point (St- 36) and the Hoku point (Li- 4) were tested by a low frequency Ea (2 Hz; LFEa) and a high frequency Ea (20 Hz; HFEa) with stimulation intensities 20 times the motor threshold. Neither the HR nor the BP was affected when the Tsusanli point was stimulated. Whereas, Ea stimulations at the Hoku point elicit chronotropic and pressor effects. The patterns of pressor responses caused by the LFEa were {{different from that of}} an HFEa, i. e., the LFEa elicited a tonic effect, while an HFEa had a phasic one. The HFEa-induced pressor and chronotropic effects were attenuated, while the LFEa induced effects were completely blocked by an intravenous infusion of an alpha-adrenergic blocker (<b>moxisylyte</b> 0. 2 mg/min/kg, i. v., for 20 min). A co-infusion with alpha-and beta-adrenergic blockers (propanolol 0. 2 mg/min/kg, i. v., for 20 min) completely blocked the HFEa-induced pressor and chronotropic effects. We concluded that Ea stimulations, at the Hoku acupoint, with appropriate stimulation parameters can increase and maintain BP. Furthermore, the LFEa stimulation activates sympathetic vasomotor tone, whereas the HFEa stimulation causes an additional potentiation on the sympathetic drive to the heart. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract Altogether 406 {{patients}} {{were included in}} five studies, and all {{patients were}} examined and controlled in the Oulu University Hospital during the years 1991 – 1998. Twenty-nine patients with mixed-type erectile dysfunction (ED) were recruited into a randomized, controlled, double-blind crossover comparison of placebo and high-dose yohimbine hydrochloride (36  mg per day orally). Positive clinical responses were obtained in 44 % of the patients during yohimbine treatment and in 48 % during placebo treatment. Thirty patients with ED underwent an intracavernosal injection test (ICI) using three different active agents (prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1), papaverine hydrochloride (PV), <b>moxisylyte</b> (MS)) and physiological saline. PGE 1 produced significantly better rigidity than either PV or MS. Sixty-nine patients with ED who had started ICI therapy with PGE 1 {{at least three years}} previously were invited to a control examination to find out the long-term outcome of this treatment and to evaluate the patients' overall satisfaction with their sexual life. 46. 4 % of the patients had discontinued PGE 1 therapy, the mean time of using PGE 1 having been 23. 3 months (range 0 – 48 months). 34. 8 % of the patients reported that their own spontaneous erections had improved during the PGE 1 therapy. The sexual functions of 155 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were evaluated before TURP and 6 and 12 months afterwards with questionnaires. Only 26 % of the patients had completely satisfactory erections before TURP, while 22 % had satisfactory erections 6 months later and 24 % 12 months later. The majority of patients (about 70 %) were satisfied with their sexual life {{both before and after the}} procedure. 123 men with symptoms of andropause participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the effects of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) gel in men with andropausal symptoms. The drug was administered transdermally once a day during six months. Early morning erections improved significantly (p   12) international index of the prostatic symptoms score (I-PSS) before DHT treatment, I-PSS decreased from 17. 7 to 12. 3 points. As a conclusion yohimbine hydrochloride is no better than placebo in the treatment of patients with mixed-type ED. PGE 1, PV and MS are well tolerated, and PGE 1 was shown to be the most effective drug of the three. ICI therapy with PGE 1 in long-term use is safe and effective. Sexual functions in men did not change after TURP, and this group of aging men were fairly satisfied with their sexual life despite of the fact that they had some ED and one third of the patients had not had intercourse during the previous year. Transdermal administration of DHT in aging men improves sexual function...|$|E
