2500|$|Like much of Southeast Asia, Hoa {{dominate}} Vietnamese {{commerce and}} industry {{at every level}} of society. Before 1975, entrepreneurial savvy Chinese had literally taken over Vietnam's entire economy. The economic power of the Hoa is far greater than that of their proportion in the population in addition to the Chinese being socioeconomically successful for hundreds of years than the indigenous host Kinh population. Hoa Chinese wield tremendous economic clout over their indigenous Kinh Vietnamese majority counterparts and {{play a critical role in}} maintaining the country's economic vitality and prosperity before having their property confiscated by the Vietnamese Communists after 1975. Ethnic Chinese controlled about 75 percent of the economic activity in South Vietnam in 1975, including 100 percent of the domestic wholesale trade, 80 percent of the industry, 70 percent of the foreign trade and presided over half the country's retail trade. Some 117 of the 670 leading Vietnamese business families were of ethnic Chinese descent. Utilizing the Confucian paradigm of personal networks, Hoa have dominated several types of businesses such as financial services, food, information technology, chemicals, electronic and electrical equipment, machinery, fabricated metals, wholesale trade, transportation equipment, and other <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>services.</b> Constituting a mere 1 percent of Vietnam's population, ethnic Chinese controlled an estimated 90 percent of non-European private capital in the mid-1960s and dominated Vietnam's entire retail trade, financial services, manufacturing, and transportation sectors, and all aspects of the country's rice economy. [...] Although there were also numerous wealthy Vietnamese in the commercial class, the disproportionate amount economic power held by the Hoa minority led to resentment from the indigenous Vietnamese Kinh majority.|$|E
