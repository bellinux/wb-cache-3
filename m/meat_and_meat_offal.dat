Based on the export data of Philippine export to Japan, there are certain commodities that were initially decreasing prior to the agreement that significantly increased, 7  years since the implementation of the agreement such as: <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> edible <b>meat</b> <b>offal</b> (15, 3312.2 %), umbrellas, sun umbrellas, walking-sticks, whips, riding-crops and parts thereof (1878.1 %), explosives; pyrotechnic products, matches, pyrophoric alloys, certain combustible preparations (1091.7 %).

Moreover, the study highlights big share of specific products in Brazilian agricultural imports, that is, at first, edible vegetables and certain roots, cereals, edible fruits and nuts, and animal or vegetable fats and oils; at second, dairy products, beverages, spirits <b>and</b> vinegar, live animals, <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> edible <b>meat</b> <b>offal,</b> oil seeds <b>and</b> oleaginous fruits, preparations of vegetables, and miscellaneous edible preparations.

There is a trend for positive increasings in nominal level of agricultural exports. Substantive correlation between mean values and median values exported was also highlighted, something that can suggest the presence of products concentrating revenues. Moreover, increasing in mean values of agricultural exports was greater than increasing in mean values of global Brazilian exports, particularly from 2000. In terms of frequency in exported items, fruits <b>and</b> <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> edible <b>meat</b> <b>offal</b> must be cited.

40|$|There {{is little}} doubt that vitamin D {{deficiency}} across all age groups in Europe is a problem. Low vitamin D status arises due to limited, if any, dermal synthesis during the winter months at latitudes above 40 &#x 00 B 0;N, putting increased importance on dietary supply of the vitamin. However, dietary intakes by most populations are low due to the limited supply of vitamin D-rich foods in the food chain. Thus strategies that effectively address this public health issue are urgently required. It has been emphasized and re-emphasized that there are {{only a limited number of}} public health strategies available to correct low dietary vitamin D intake: 1 improving intake of naturally occurring vitamin D-rich foods, 2 vitamin D fortification (mandatory or voluntarily) of food, and 3 vitamin D supplementation. Recent evidence suggests that the levels of vitamin D added to food would need to be high so as to ensure dietary requirements are met and health outcomes optimized. In addition, knowledge of the most effective forms of vitamin D to use in some of these preventative approaches is important. There is still uncertainty in relation to the relative efficacy of vitamin D 2 versus D 3, the two main food derived forms and those used in vitamin D supplements. The major metabolite of vitamin D with biological activity is 1, 25 (OH) 2 D; however, this is usually used for pharmacological purposes and is not typically used in normal, healthy people. The other major metabolite, 25 (OH) D, which has also been used for pharmacological purposes is present in certain foods such as <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>meat</b> products (particularly <b>offal)</b> as well as eggs. This metabolite may have the potential to boost vitamin D status up to five times more effectively that native vitamin D 3 in foods.

40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} is {{a global}} problem among women of reproductive age, particularly in developing countries. A recent survey from the Solomon Islands reported that 44 % of women of reproductive aged were anaemic. Currently nothing {{is known about the}} iron status of women from the Solomon Islands living in New Zealand (NZ). Aim: This study aims to assess and compare iron status and factors influencing iron status of Solomon Islands with Caucasian women living in and around Auckland, NZ. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study comparing 40 Solomon Islands women with 80 age-matched Caucasian women living in and around Auckland. Serum ferritin (SF), C-reactive protein (CRP) and haemoglobin (Hb) were analyzed. Iron status was defined as: iron replete (SF > 20 µg/L + Hb > 120 g/L), iron deficiency (ID) (SF 120 g/L) and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) (SF 10 mg/L were excluded from this study. Dietary assessment was conducted using a computerised iron food frequency questionnaire including questions on dietary habits, purposely to assess foods affecting iron status. In addition, a 24 -hour dietary recall was used to assess the average daily nutrient intake of Solomon Islands women. Demographic and body composition data were also collected together with data on other factors affecting iron status such as blood loss and general health history. Results: No significant difference in the prevalence of low iron stores + IDA was found in Solomon Islands and Caucasian women (17 vs. 23 %, p= 0. 478). The frequency of red <b>meat,</b> prepared <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>offal,</b> <b>and</b> all white <b>meat</b> consumption did not differ between the two groups (p= 0. 187). There was a significant difference in fish/seafood consumption (p= 0. 001), Solomon Islands women consumed fish/seafood more frequently than Caucasian women. Solomon Islands women also consumed medium-high vitamin C fruits more frequently (p= 0. 002) and dairy products less frequently (p= 0. 001) than Caucasian women. No significant difference (p= 0. 872) was identified in the frequency of intake of beverages containing polyphenol between the two groups. But the analysis of individual beverages showed that Solomon Islands women more frequently consumed black tea compared to Caucasian women, the similar practice was identified from the dietary habit assessment where 40 % of Solomon Islands women drank black tea an hour before or after evening meals. Fewer Solomon Islands women consumed multivitamins/minerals than Caucasian women (12. 8 % vs. 66. 7 % respectively) and none of the Solomon Islands women reported taking dietary supplements compared to 44 % Caucasian women. In regards to menstrual blood loss, although {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups in overall menstrual blood loss units, Caucasian women reported on average 1 day longer menstrual period than Solomon Islands women. A small number of women in each group had previously donated blood, but in every case it had taken place more than 6 months prior to this study. Contraceptive use was significantly lower among Solomon Islands women compared to Caucasian women (p= 0. 001). Body mass index and waist circumferences were significantly higher (p= 0. 001 and p= 0. 001 respectively) in the Solomon Islands women compared to the Caucasian women. Conclusion: The iron status of Solomon Islands and Caucasian women did not differ, but there was variability between groups in the intake of foods and behaviours that are known to influence iron status. This study found both protective and non-protective factors for ID among Solomon Islands women, although the correlation of those factors with iron status were not able to be assessed due to a relatively small sample size and low prevalence of ID/IDA. This study therefore concludes that ID was not a concern for Solomon Islands women living in NZ, and that the prevalence was lower in this group than in women living in the Solomon Islands. This is possibly the result of adapting to different dietary habits and behaviours, increased accessibility to animal sources of iron, and high intakes of vitamin C-rich foods in their host country...|$|R

Within the investigated consumer demand, the levels of current income elasticity, dynamic income elasticity, long-term income elasticity, long-equilibrium income elasticity were evaluated. Realised demand analysis was based on the autoregressive log-linear model of Engel's curve: lnqt = − 11. 9878 + 1. 4733 lnxt + 0. 1917 lnqt− 1 + vt, which was estimated by using the CZSO-HS data from 1995 to 2000. Developed Engel model of the quarterly demand was statistically significant (F-test, t-tests, DW-test). According to this autoregressive log-linear Engel's model, the level of the current income elasticity of the average Czechs' household demand for the <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>meat</b> products was 1. 4733. The dynamic income elasticity with quarterly lag achieved the value of 0. 2825. Half-yearly dynamic income elasticity of the average Czechs' household demand for the <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>meat</b> products obtained the value of 5. 4186 · 10 − 2. The level of year dynamic income elasticity of examined consumer demand was 1. 9915 · 10 − 3.
