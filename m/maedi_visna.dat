5000|$|Visna - Maedi is {{a chronic}} viral disease {{prevalent}} in adult sheep. The disease is rarely found in certain species of goat. <b>Maedi</b> <b>Visna</b> virus is {{also referred to}} as ovine progressive pneumonia (OPP). This disease corresponds to two clinical entities caused by the same Maedi is a form that results in a chronic progressive pneumonia. Visna refers to the neurological form of the disease and predominantly causes meningoencephalitis in adult sheep. This disease has inflicted many economic losses worldwide due to the long incubation period and the high mortality rate of sheep and goats. MV virus can infect sheep of any age but clinical symptoms rarely occur in sheep less than two years old. The onset of the diseases is gradual resulting in relentless loss of weight in addition to breathing problems. Cough, abortion, rapid breathing, depression, chronic mastitis and arthritis are also additional symptoms observed. These symptoms appear mostly in animals over the age of three and therefore might spread to other flocks before clinical diagnosis can be achieved. Animals showing the above symptoms might die within six months of infection. This causal lentivirus can be found in monocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages of infected sheep in the presence of humoral and cell mediated immune response and can also be detected by conducting several serological tests. Transmission of the disease occurs most commonly via the oral route caused by ingestion of colostrum or milk that contains the virus or inhalation of infected aerosol droplets. Due to variation of the strains of MVV, some of the association clinical symptoms may be more pre-dominant in a flock relative to others along with differences in genetic susceptibility patterns.|$|E

40|$|Maedi-visna is an {{economically}} important viral disease of sheep that occasionally affects goats. The maedi-visna virus (MVV), a lentivirus; infects its hosts for life.

40|$|Lentiviruses {{provide a}} {{suitable}} {{starting point for}} the generation of viral vectors for vaccination due to their ability to transduce non-dividing cells, including dendritic cells. This allows the delivery of antigens directly to antigen presenting cells to stimulate an immune response. The most well developed and characterised lentiviral vector is based on HIV- 1 which now incorporates safety features to minimise the effects of hazards such as insertional oncogenesis. These HIV- 1 vectors have been shown to mediate immunity against several pathogens including: Plasmodium falciparum, the Influenza Virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in mouse models. Our group has applied the advances in the HIV- 1 system to the <b>visna</b> <b>maedi</b> virus in order to engineer vaccines suitable for sheep.

There is however no data about the genetic diversity of Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Virus (CAEV) or <b>Maedi</b> <b>Visna</b> Virus (MVV) in this country. Findings We performed a molecular and phylogenetic analysis of sheep and goat lentiviruses from a small geographic area in Canada using long sequences from the gag region of 30 infected sheep and 36 infected goats originating from 14 different flocks. Pairwise DNA distance and phylogenetic analyses revealed that all SRLV sequences obtained from sheep clustered tightly with prototypical <b>Maedi</b> <b>visna</b> sequences from America. Similarly, all SRLV strains obtained from goats clustered tightly with prototypical US CAEV-Cork strain.

40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that French small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV) from sheep are {{more similar to}} Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Virus (CAEV) than to <b>visna</b> <b>maedi</b> virus (VMV) in a conserved region of the pol gene. To extend these results, we have examined sequences from a variable region of the env gene in French SRLV. We found that they were nearly equally distant from both CAEV and VMV strains, suggesting a considerable divergence since the initial introduction of the virus. Analysis of separate clones from individual animals showed that some carry a population of variant viruses. The study of further pol gene sequences from both goats and sheep suggests that viral variants show little or no host species specificity.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the pathogenesis of the lymphoproliferative response in the chronic-active <b>visna</b> <b>maedi</b> virus- induced inflammatory lesions.

A persistent and high level of Ia antigen expression was seen in macrophage-like cells in the inflammatory lesions, and the amounts of viral RNA and Ia expression were closely correlated. A small subpopulation of macrophages contained both viral RNA and Ia antigen, and these were found in greatest number in the lung. In vitro experiments showed that a lentivirus-induced interferon (LV-IFN) could induce Ia antigens in normal sheep spleen and lymph node cells {{as well as in}} a transformed sheep macrophage cell line. Ia antigen expression in macrophages was transient {{in the absence of a}} continuing IFN stimulus and persisted for at least 2 wk in the presence of LV-IFN. LV- IFN also restricted viral replication in macrophages.

50|$|<b>Visna</b> <b>Maedi</b> virus (VMV) {{belongs to}} the small {{ruminant}} lentivirus group (SRLV). In general, SRLVs enter the cell through the interaction of their glycosylated envelope protein with a cellular receptor on the cell's plasma membrane facilitating fusion of the viral and cellular membrane. However, the specific cellular receptor that VMV binds is not entirely certain. A few studies have proposed MHC class II, CD4 and CXCR4 proteins as possible receptors however, none of these proteins have been established as the main receptor. Another study suggests that C-type lectins part of the mannose receptor (MR) family play a role as an alternative SRLV receptor. The mannose receptor is a 180-kDa transmembrane protein with eight tandem C-type lectin carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) of which CRD4 and CRD5 are essential in recognizing mannose, fucose and N-acetyl glucosamine residues. Studies suggest that VMV gains entrance to the cell via mannosylated residues on its envelope proteins. MR is involved in recognizing the surface of pathogens and is involved in phago- and endocytosis and mediating antigen processing and presentation {{in a variety of}} cells including monocyte/macrophages and endothelial cells.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Caprine arthritis/encephalitis (CAE) {{of goats}} and {{occasionally}} sheep are persistent virus infections {{caused by a}} lentivirus (CAEV). This viral infection results in arthritis in adult animals and encephalitis in kids. Prognosis for the encephalitic form is normally poor, with substantial economic loss for the farm. In this context an early/fast laboratory diagnosis for CAEV infection could be useful for effective prophylactic action. In this work we performed a quantitative real time PCR designed on the CAEV env gene to detect/quantify in goat/sheep samples, viral RNA or proviral DNA forms of CAEV. This procedure was validated in 15 sheep, experimentally infected with CAEV or with a highly correlated lentivirus (<b>visna</b> <b>maedi,</b> MVV); in addition, a total of 37 clinical goat specimens recruited in CAEV positive herds were analyzed and compared using serological analysis (Elisa and AGID). All samples infected with MVV resulted negative.

Here, we found that TNFα and GM-CSF activated CAEV transcription in U 937 cells. However, this activation effect was not blocked by SP 600125, an inhibitor of Jun N-terminal kinase. SP 600125 effectively prevented Jun phosphorylation in cells subsequently treated with cytokines.

In particular, newborn lambs were naturally fed maternal colostrum and humanely killed at 10, 24, 48, 72, 96 h and 7 and 10 days after birth; two caesarian-derived lambs served as uninfected controls. No lesions suggestive of MVVinfection were found, but marked immunoreactions for MVV capsid antigen (CA, p 28) were detected in lambs fed maternal colostrum and in macrophages cultured from colostrum.

Variable numbers of alveolar macrophages containing MVV-core protein were present in alveolar lumina, the majority of positive cells showing morphological evidence of activation. In regional lymphoid tissue there were increased numbers of CD 8 + and gamma delta expressing T cells in lymphoid follicles and germinal centres of infected animals. The specificity of these cells is unknown and we could find no evidence for the presence of cells productively infected with the virus in these structures. This study shows that activated T lymphocytes, particularly of the CD 8 subset, play a major part in the pathogenesis of MVV-induced pulmonary and regional lymph node lesions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe long {{terminal}} repeats of <b>maedi</b> <b>visna</b> {{virus strain}} 1514 contain a consensus AP- 1 binding site {{which has been}} shown to be important in controlling virus transcription. However, this consensus site is absent in strain EV- 1. Here, we have compared the ability of oligonucleotides corresponding to LTR sequences from EV- 1 with those from 1514 to bind transcription factors in competitive gel retardation assays and activate reporter gene expression. The experiments demonstrated no observable binding of AP- 1 to the EV- 1 -derived sequences and significant differences in the abilities of the 1514 and EV- 1 sequences to activate transcription. However, both viral sequences interacted with a second, previously undetected, transcription factor. This factor gave specific gel shifts which were competed by an oligonucleotide containing the consensus sequence for the AML/PEBP 2 /CBF family of transcriptional factors, but not by control AP- 1 or OCT- 1 oligonucleotides. The factor was therefore denoted AML (vis). A second AML (vis) site, noted upstream of the TATA box proximal AP- 1 site, gave single shifts which were competed by the downstream AML (vis) oligonucleotide. Both sites were functional in transfection assays. In gel shift retardation assays, polyclonal antisera directed against known runt domain proteins were able to supershift part of the AML (vis) binding activity in nuclear extracts from physiologically relevant cell types. The results thus suggest that the AML (vis) binding factor belongs to the AML/PEBP 2 /CBF family of transcription factors and may be important in controlling virus replication in these and other strains of ruminant lentiviruses...|$|E
40|$|Small {{ruminant}} lentiviruses (SRLVs) cause different clinical {{forms of}} disease in sheep and goats. So far in Spain, <b>Maedi</b> <b>visna</b> virus-like (MVV-like) sequences {{have been found}} in both species, and the arthritic SRLV disease has never been found in sheep until a recent outbreak. Knowing that arthritis is common in goats, it was of interest to determine if the genetic type of the virus involved in the sheep arthritis outbreak was caprine arthritis encephalitis virus-like (CAEV-like) rather than MVV-like. Alignment and phylogenetic analyses on nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences from SRLV of this outbreak, allowed a B 2 genetic subgroup assignment of these SRLV, compatible with a correspondence between the virus genetic type and the disease form. Furthermore, an isolate was obtained from the arthritic outbreak, its full genome was CAEV-like but the pol integrase region was MVV-like. Although its LTR lacked a U 3 repeat sequence and had a deletion in the R region, which has been proposed to reduce viral replication rate, its phenotype in sheep skin fibroblast cultures was rapid/high, thus it appeared to have adapted to sheep cells. This outbreak study represents the first report on CAEV-like genetic findings and complete genome analysis among Spanish small ruminants. © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|A {{cohort study}} was {{conducted}} in order to measure the effect of the chronic indurative lymphocytic mastitis caused by the South African strain of <b>maedi</b> <b>visna</b> virus (MVV) on the pre-weaning growth of lambs born either of naturally infected or uninfected ewes kept under similar conditions. Fifty naturally infected ewes as well as another 40 from a maedi-visna-free source to be used as control animals, were purchased and kept in separate flocks which were managed in a similar way. All the ewes were of the same breed and 3 - 4 years old. During the adaptation period, and through the mating, pregnancy and lactation periods they were periodically monitored for the presence of MVV serum antibodies. The lambs were weighed at birth and thereafter every 2 weeks until the age of 90 days, when they were weaned. The ewes were then slaughtered, and their udders examined histologically and the number of lymphocytic follicles were counted and assessed. Although the calculated values indicated a correlation between the number of follicles in the udder and the reduction in the growth rate of the lambs, this was not statistically significant. Similarly, despite higher counts of lymphoid follicles in the udders of sero-positive ewes as compared to those that were sero-negative and the lower ewe productivity indexes in infected ewes, no statistically significant differences were found in the indexes of ewes in different follicle categories.

40|$|AbstractPrimate {{lentivirus}} (HIV and SIV) vpr accessory genes encode 12 - to 14 -kDa proteins which induce {{cell cycle}} arrest at the G 2 phase of infected cells, {{preventing them from}} going through mitosis. Members of the HIV- 2 /SIVmac/SIVsmm group also encode a second closely related accessory protein called Vpx. Vpx and HIV Vpr are critical for virus replication in nondividing cells due to their participation in nuclear import of the preintegration complex. Caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV) and <b>maedi</b> <b>visna</b> virus are the natural lentiviruses of domestic goat and sheep, respectively, and their genomes do not carry vpr and vpx genes. In this study, we generated chimeric CAEV-based genomes carrying vpr and vpx genes from SIVmac 239 and tested their ability to induce G 2 cell cycle arrest in infected caprine cells. CAEV–pBSCAvpxvpr is the chimeric genome that was shown to be infectious and replication competent. Our data demonstrated that CAEV–pBSCAvpxvpr-infected goat synovial membrane cell monolayer developed more cytopathic effects and {{a high proportion of}} cells remained in the G 2 phase of cell cycle. This G 2 arrest was observed both at the early and at the late stages of infection, while minimal effect was observed with the parental CAEV–pBSCA. These results, described {{for the first time in}} mammalian cells other than those of primates, indicate that Vpr-induced G 2 cell cycle arrest is not restricted to only primate cells. Thus, conservation of Vpx/Vpr protein functions in caprine cells suggests a possible role for these proteins in the virus life cycle and its ability to adapt to new hosts. The data presented here thus raise a pertinent question about the biological significance of the conservation of Vpr and Vpx functions in caprine cells despite the high phylogenic distance between primates and small ruminants...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of Small Ruminant Lentivirus (SRLV) {{is based on}} clinical signs, pathological lesions and laboratory testing. No standard reference test for the {{diagnosis of}} <b>maedi</b> <b>visna</b> has been validated up to the present, and it is puzzling that tests which detect antibodies against the virus and tests which detect the proviral genome may render opposite results. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the presence in milk throughout a lactation period of specific antibodies by ELISA and of SRLV proviral DNA by a PCR of the highly conserved pol region. A six-month study was conducted with the milk of 28 ewes and 31 goats intensively reared. The percentage of animals with antibodies against SRLV increased throughout the study period. Seroprevalence in sheep was 28 % at the beginning of the study and by the end it had increased up to 52. 4 %. In goats, initial seroprevalence of 5. 6 % increased to 16 %. The percentage of PCR positive ewes was stable throughout the study period. Of the positive sheep, 21. 4 % were PCR-positive before antibodies could be detected and most of them became PCR-negative shortly after the first detection of antibodies. This might suggest that antibodies have a neutralizing effect. In addition, an equal percentage of sheep were always PCR-negative but either became ELISA-positive or was always ELISA-positive, which might support this hypothesis. On the other hand, the PCR results in goats did not follow any pattern and oscillated between 35. 3 % and 55. 6 % depending on the month. Most goats positive by PCR failed to develop antibodies in the 6 months tested. We may conclude that the infection and the antibody response to it follow a different trend in sheep and goats...|$|E
