5|$|The Japanese military's {{efforts to}} defend Singapore from air attack were unsuccessful. Due to the weak {{state of the}} island's air defences, only nine B-29s were shot down during the American campaign, all of them during {{daylight}} raids. Minesweeping operations were also slow, and it took three weeks to declare the port safe after each Allied minelaying raid. The surviving crew <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> bombers that were shot down met varying fates; a small number linked up with resistance movements such as the Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army, while others were captured by the Japanese and held in harsh conditions. Those who were captured by the IJN and held at the Naval Base were beheaded. After the war, the Japanese personnel believed responsible for atrocities against these prisoners were tried during the Seletar War Crimes Trials and those found guilty were executed or served long prison sentences.|$|E
