5|$|<b>Mobile</b> <b>device</b> {{forensics}} is a sub-branch {{of digital}} forensics relating to recovery of digital evidence or {{data from a}} <b>mobile</b> <b>device.</b> It differs from Computer forensics in that a <b>mobile</b> <b>device</b> will have an inbuilt communication system (e.g. GSM) and, usually, proprietary storage mechanisms. Investigations usually focus on simple data such as call data and communications (SMS/Email) rather than in-depth recovery of deleted data.

The study was informed by the technology acceptance model and used a participant pool of 73 parents of high school students attending a Title I high school in a large Midwestern city in the United States. Data were collected using an online survey and analyzed using Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlations.

The only audio components are an orchestral score in the main menu and background sounds (e.g., clashing weapons). In August 2007, Phil Cohen, producer, designer, and game director for Betrayal, spoke of the difficulties in developing a God of War game for a <b>mobile</b> <b>device.</b> Cohen said that although enjoyable, the greatest challenge was creating a single tileset and palette swapping scheme that was diverse enough to portray multiple environments with only several hundred kilobytes, and that met series creator Santa Monica Studio's high standards. He wrote the initial design document between September and October 2005, and revisited it in August 2006, the month development started.

40|$|ICTs, {{including}} <b>mobile</b> <b>devices,</b> {{are changing}} rapidly, {{and so is}} the application of these technologies in various disciplines. From the literature it was determined that <b>mobile</b> <b>devices</b> have an influence on information behaviour, whether it be in the form of information seeking, searching, use, sharing, collaboration, or any other information behaviour activity. This study focused on the influence of <b>mobile</b> <b>devices</b> on the information behaviour of undergraduate and postgraduate students in the Department of Information Science at the University of Pretoria. Understanding the influence that <b>mobile</b> <b>devices</b> have on information behaviour might improve the effective use of <b>mobile</b> <b>devices</b> in education, and might be of use to library services. A mixed methods approach was followed, consisting of questionnaires for the collection of quantitative data and focus group interviews for the collection of qualitative data. Convenience sampling was used to select undergraduate and postgraduate students in the Department of Information Science. This was followed by a census approach in which all students were invited to participate in completing the electronic self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire collected data on <b>mobile</b> <b>devices</b> and information behaviour, <b>mobile</b> <b>devices</b> and academic studies, <b>mobile</b> <b>devices</b> and clickUP, <b>mobile</b> <b>devices</b> and the Blackboard App and <b>mobile</b> <b>devices</b> and communication. The questionnaire was open from 06 October – 07 November 2013 and 201 / 923 (21. 8 %) students responded. Purposive sampling was used to invite focus group participants. The focus groups were guided by four topics: general use of <b>mobile</b> <b>devices</b> to find, access, share and use information; differences in using <b>mobile</b> <b>devices</b> to find, access, share and use information for academic purposes; different <b>mobile</b> <b>devices</b> used for different purposes; and recommendation(s) to other students for using <b>mobile</b> <b>devices</b> for academic purposes. Five focus group interviews were conducted with a total of 32 participants between 20 August and 09 September 2014. It was found that <b>mobile</b> <b>devices</b> have an influence on the information behaviour of students, confirming what was found in the literature. <b>Mobile</b> <b>devices</b> are used more in a general and social environment than in an academic one. They however hold much value for the academic environment. Participants in the study stressed the importance, the advantages, and the potential that the <b>mobile</b> <b>devices</b> have, and still could have in the future. Participants made use of multiple <b>mobile</b> <b>devices</b> in their day-to-day activities. Furthermore, it is clear that information should be available quickly, allowing access from anywhere and at any time in order to satisfy the changing demands of the information user.
