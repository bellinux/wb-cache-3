5|$|All {{actinides}} are pyrophoric, {{especially when}} finely divided, that is, they spontaneously ignite upon reaction with air. The <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> of actinides {{does not have}} a clear dependence on the number of f-electrons. The unusually low <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> of neptunium and plutonium (~640°C) is explained by hybridization of 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in these metals.|$|E

5|$|Francium is an {{alkali metal}} whose {{chemical}} properties mostly {{resemble those of}} caesium. A heavy element with a single valence electron, it has the highest equivalent weight of any element. Liquid francium—if created—should have a surface tension of 0.05092N/m at its <b>melting</b> <b>point.</b> Francium's <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> was calculated to be around 27°C (80°F, 300K). The <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> is uncertain because of the element's extreme rarity and radioactivity. Thus, the estimated boiling point value of 677°C (1250°F, 950K) is also uncertain.|$|E
50|$|Lead-bismuth alloys with between 30% and 75% bismuth {{all have}} <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> below 200 °C/392 °F.Alloys with between 48% and 63% bismuth have <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> below 150 °C/302 °F.|$|R
50|$|The {{elements}} {{become less}} reactive and have higher <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> as the atomic number increases. The higher <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> {{are caused by}} stronger London dispersion forces resulting from more electrons.|$|R
50|$|Thus, trans alkenes, {{which are}} less polar and more symmetrical, have lower boiling <b>points</b> and higher <b>melting</b> <b>points,</b> and cis alkenes, which are {{generally}} more polar and less symmetrical, have higher boiling <b>points</b> and lower <b>melting</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R
5|$|Of all {{metals in}} pure form, {{tungsten}} {{has the highest}} <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> (3422°C, 6192°F), lowest vapor pressure (at temperatures above 1650°C, 3000°F), and the highest tensile strength. Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, carbon sublimes at atmospheric pressure instead of melting, so it has no <b>melting</b> <b>point.</b> Tungsten has the lowest {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and high <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons.|$|E
5|$|The <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> of gallium, at 302.9146K (29.7646°C, 85.5763°F), is {{just above}} room temperature, and is {{approximately}} {{the same as the}} average summer daytime temperatures in Earth's mid-latitudes. This <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> (mp) is one of the formal temperature reference points in the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) established by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). The triple point of gallium, 302.9166K (29.7666°C, 85.5799°F), is used by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in preference to the <b>melting</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
5|$|The self-damage {{induced by}} the {{radioactivity}} of einsteinium {{is so strong that}} it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice, and the energy release during this process, 1000 watts per gram of 253Es, induces a visible glow. These processes may contribute to the relatively low density and <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> of einsteinium. Further, owing to the small size of the available samples, the <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> of einsteinium was often deduced by observing the sample being heated inside an electron microscope. Thus the surface effects in small samples could reduce the <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> value.|$|E
40|$|<b>Melting</b> <b>points</b> are {{significant}} properties {{for the design}} and application of ionic liquids (ILs) as green solvents. In this work, the <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> of two kinds of room temperature ionic liquids, imidazolium tetrafluoroborates and imidazolium hexafluorophosphates, were investigated by using a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) approach. The employed descriptors were firstly selected by studying the optimized geometries of four ILs: EmimBF(4), BmimBF(4), EmimPF(6) and BmimPF(6). Electrostatic, quantum mechanical and topological descriptors were considered efficient to describe <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> of ionic liquids. A three-parameter model with the squared correlation coefficient, R- 2, of 0. 9047 is developed for 16 kinds of imidazolium tetrafluoroborates, and a six-parameter equation with R- 2 of 0. 9207 is obtained for 25 kinds of imidazolium hexafluorophosphates. The proposed models can be useful for the prediction of the <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> of ILs with similar structural features. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

2500|$|Low-temperature ionic liquids can be {{compared}} to ionic solutions, liquids that contain both ions and neutral molecules, and in particular to the so-called deep eutectic solvents, mixtures of ionic and non-ionic solid substances which have much lower <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> than the pure compounds.

25|$|The <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> of {{branched-chain}} alkanes can {{be either}} higher or {{lower than those of}} the corresponding straight-chain alkanes, again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase: This is particularly true for isoalkanes (2-methyl isomers), which often have <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> higher than those of the linear analogues.|$|R

Densities, <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> and glass transition points, {{solubility in water}} as well as polarities have been measured.

5|$|Europium is a {{ductile metal}} with a {{hardness}} {{similar to that}} of lead. It crystallizes in a body-centered cubic lattice.

50|$|Most {{research}} {{conducted in the}} last two decades has focused on improving the performance of the two most promising compounds developed by Manlabs, ZrB2 and HfB2, though significant work has continued in characterizing the nitrides, oxides, and carbides of the group four and five elements. In comparison to carbides and nitrides, the diborides tend to have higher thermal conductivity but lower <b>melting</b> <b>points,</b> a tradeoff which gives them good thermal shock resistance and makes them ideal for many high-temperature thermal applications. The <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> of many UHTCs are shown in Table 1. Despite the high <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> of pure UHTCs, they are unsuitable for many refractory applications because of their high susceptibility to oxidation at elevated temperatures.|$|R

5|$|The {{fluorides}} of tantalum can be {{used for}} its separation from niobium. Tantalum forms halogen compounds in the oxidation states of +5, +4, and +3 of the type , , and , although multi-core complexes and substoichiometric compounds are also known. Tantalum pentafluoride (TaF5) is a white solid with a <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> of 97.0°C and tantalum pentachloride (TaCl5) is a white solid with a <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> of 247.4°C. Tantalum pentachloride is hydrolyzed by water and reacts with additional tantalum at elevated temperatures by forming the black and highly hygroscopic tantalum tetrachloride (TaCl4). While the trihalides can be obtained by reduction of the pentahalides with hydrogen, the dihalides do not exist. A tantalum-tellurium alloy forms quasicrystals. Tantalum compounds with oxidation states as low as −1 have been reported in 2008.|$|E
