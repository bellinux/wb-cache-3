30|$|One can now {{consider}} the time evolution of this proposed scheme for the Y-network, further looking at Fig. 7. Consider that five messages from each terminal {{are to be}} exchanged with the other terminals: the first time slot is solely used for the first MAC phase (i.e., the uplink of the messages to the relay); the second time slot {{is used for the}} first downlink phase of data, and simultaneously for the second uplink phase (i.e., for the second messages of the terminals); this procedure is repeated until the sixth time slot, which is only used for the last downlink phase of information. Hence, six time slots are required for all the messages to be exchanged between the terminals. In general, the downlink phase corresponding to the (n− 1)th <b>message</b> <b>uploaded</b> to the relay is performed during the same time slot as the uplink phase of the next nth message; consequently, the number of slots required to exchange N messages is N+ 1 and so, when N becomes large, the scheme accomplishes the message exchange between all terminals in the Y-network using only one time slot on average.|$|R

40|$|The online {{student finance}} system {{is widely used}} in this {{knowledge}} century. It {{is one of the}} web-based systems that used in university for any financial transactions among staffs and students. Various types of university online financial systems are able to set the tuition fees, financial statement, invoices and make payment. The UTM online finance system is one of the financial portals that promise a new, convenient and safe finance environment. It attends to financing needs, along with providing a simple online system for Invoice, balance and payment. The current UTM online finance system has some drawbacks such as the system is not able to send any email notification to the student when a new invoice is issued, students are not able to check their financial statements, refund, payment, student financial status and invoices in details, the staff issues manual receipt of the payment that the student made and if the students have a problem they need to go manually to the finance department to solve their problem. Furthermore, the current system does not have online payment by visa card. The methodology used in this project is a waterfall model methodology which is a series of phases which are planning, requirements analysis, system design implementation and testing. According to the explained drawbacks for the current system, this project proposes new features solve the problems in current online UTM student finance system such as making online payments, sending an email to the student whenever a new invoice is issued. Furthermore, issuing electronic receipts for the payments that are made by the students, communicating with staff by sending <b>messages,</b> <b>uploading</b> student’s payment transfer fund or payment receipt and keeping and tracing the receipt.

40|$|Abstract—Recently, {{there have}} been {{proposals}} to evade censors by using steganography to embed secret messages in images shared on public photo-sharing sites. However, establishing a covert channel in this manner is not straightforward. First, photo-sharing sites often process uploaded images, thus destroying any embedded message. Second, prior work assumes {{the existence of an}} out-of-band channel, using which the communicating users can exchange metadata or secret keys a priori; establishing such out-of-band channels, not monitored by censors, is difficult. In this paper, we address these issues to facilitate private commu-nications on photo-sharing sites. In doing so, first, we conduct an in-depth measurement study of the feasibility of hiding data on four popular photo-sharing sites. Second, based on the understanding derived, we propose a novel approach for embedding secret <b>messages</b> in <b>uploaded</b> photos while preserving the integrity of such messages. We demonstrate that, despite the processing on photo-sharing sites, our approach ensures reliable covert communication, without increasing the likelihood of being detected via steganalysis. Lastly, we design and implement a scheme for bootstrapping private communications without an out-of-band channel, i. e., by exchanging keys via uploaded images. I...|$|R

40|$|Identity {{construction}} of diaspora people has been facilitated {{through the use}} of the Internet, particularly, social network sites (SNSs), providing online spaces for transnational communication. Diaspora identity {{construction of}} the Uyghur 2 diaspora on SNSs has not been explored, or at least has not yet been documented. This thesis presents empirical findings of a research examining the use of Facebook, as one example of SNSs, among the Uyghur diaspora with a focus on diaspora identity construction. It is guided by the research question, how the Uyghur diaspora identity is being constructed on Facebook. It provides a preliminary and exploratory analysis of how Facebook is serving as a platform for transnational Uyghur diaspora, how the Uyghur diaspora identity is negotiated through everyday Facebook use, and in turn, how the expression of identity online is contributing to the production of and emerging Uyghur diaspora identity. The research applied a two-stage content analysis of <b>messages</b> <b>uploaded</b> on the Uyghur diaspora Facebook sites during January to April, 2013. In the first stage, data were collected from Facebook profiles and were analysed quantitatively to provide a general overview of how Facebook is used among the Uyghur diaspora. Results from this stage also helped the selection of Facebook sites for a further qualitative analysis in the second stage, in which data were collected from discussion archives of selected Facebook sites and were analysed qualitatively to provide an understanding of how the Uyghur diaspora identity is being constructed online. Research findings indicate that the Uyghur diaspora identity online is actively being explored and constructed through everyday communication on Facebook. Findings suggest that this identity is defined by continuing connections to the original homeland and it is multidimensional encompassing ethnic, cultural, national, religious, and political identity. While ethnic, cultural, and national identity are being cohesively articulated, political and religious identity is negotiated with inclusion of differences and fragmentations. Nevertheless, with a common feeling of discontent towards Chinese regime and close concerns about situations of the Uyghurs in homeland, the globally dispersed Uyghur diaspora is still emerging as a collective subject. Findings demonstrate that the diaspora Uyghurs on Facebook express a strong awareness of social network sites as a useful tool for identity exploration and construction, transnational connection and communication. However, it appears that concerns over Chinese state surveillance might be a serious limitation to Facebook as a platform which encourages a stronger participation. This thesis contributes to research on how diaspora use the Internet to construct a shared imagination of identities and original homeland. It provides a foundation for future multi- and interdisciplinary studies as well as comparative and longitudinal studies on Uyghur diaspora. It points to the need for further research to address the complexity of the Uyghur diaspora identity in its interplay with other major factors for unifying the Uyghur diaspora. 1 Reziwanguli Nuermaimaiti is the candidate’s official name.

40|$|This thesis investigates how data sources, message queues, and {{messages}} can be generalized in such {{way that it}} allows for easy configuration and setup in a frontend visualization application. It also includes increasing the productivity of the application testers and the usability of the user interface. An analysis of one of Dewire’s test tools gave insightful information to identify what was needed in the proof-of-concept application and resulted in a list of requirements. The information gained from Dewire also indicated what technologies to use and resulted in a research phase. Different design proposals were presented and one was chosen to be implemented. An agile approach was chosen as method for the implementation phase to emphasize flexibility. It was set to be iterative and in close communication with people at Dewire. The implementation resulted in a proof-of-concept application with a GUI that allows user to configure data sources, message queues {{and messages}}. The <b>messages</b> are <b>uploaded</b> in XML format and the GUI allows for modification through HTML forms which mir-rors the XML files. The user is also able to send these messages as JMS mes-sages. Responses to these JMS messages are also shown in the GUI and saved in a database. The results suggest that accomplishing the common task to select a connection tree and send a message takes 45 % less time in the proof-of-concept application compared to Dewire’s tool. To accomplish the common task to alter a message and send it takes 79 % less time in the proof-of-concept appli-cation compared to Dewire’s tool. The results also suggest that theory of com-puter-human interaction have been applied during the implementation to ac-complisha usable UI. It is assessed that data sources, message queues and mes-sage can be easy configured in a GUI.

40|$|Many of {{the future}} {{automation}} concepts to transform the airspace system are likely to require significant improvements {{to the performance of}} underlying trajectory prediction algorithms. Where practical considerations may limit the achievable prediction accuracy, the impact of these inaccuracies may be mitigated significantly through the estimation and accommodation of trajectory prediction uncertainty. One approach to developing prediction uncertainty models is through the application of prediction accuracy techniques to identify and size trajectory prediction errors. This approach requires collecting and analyzing vast amounts of operational traffic data. This paper presents methods to analyze these data to automatically identify and categorize intent maneuvers. Intent maneuvers are defined as those required to achieve constraints identified within recorded operational data. The conformity of these maneuvers with observed aircraft maneuvering is crucial to facilitate the appropriate selection of data to support prediction accuracy techniques. Additionally, a searchable database is developed to support the collection of statistically representative data to facilitate error analyses. As a test of this system, operational data, including track data, associated flight plans, and other amending <b>messages,</b> were successfully <b>uploaded</b> into the database and used to test and validate the methods for intent maneuver categorization.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, an up-and-down routing {{protocol}} is proposed for mobile opportunistic social networks, which exhibit a nested core-periphery structure. In such a network, a few active nodes with large weighted degrees form the network core, while the network peripheries {{are composed of}} many inactive nodes with small weighted degrees. By nested, {{it means that the}} core-periphery structure is preserved, when periphery nodes are removed. Based on this structure, a <b>message</b> can be <b>uploaded</b> from the source to the network core, through iteratively forwarding the message to a relay that has a higher position in the nested network hierarchy. Then, space-efficient Bloom-filter-based hints are introduced to provide guidance for downloading messages from the network core to the destination. Through utilizing the network structure and space-efficient routing hints, subtle balances between the data delivery delay, ratio, and cost are achieved by our proposed approach. Finally, through extensive simulations, we show that the up-and-down routing scheme achieves a competitive performance on the data delivery delay and ratio, with a relatively small cost on the prior information maintenance and a relatively low forwarding cost.

40|$|To protect data {{security}} and privacy in cloud storage systems, a common {{solution is to}} outsource data in encrypted forms so that the data will remain secure and private even if storage systems are compromised. The encrypted data, however, must be pliable to search and access control. In this paper, we introduce a notion of attribute-based encryption with expressive and authorized keyword search (ABE-EAKS) to support both expressive keyword search and fine-grained access control over encrypted data in the cloud. In ABE-EAKS, every data user {{is associated with a}} set of attributes and is issued a private attribute-key corresponding to his/her attribute set, and each data owner encrypts the message using attribute-based encryption and attaches the encrypted message with encrypted keywords related with the <b>message,</b> and then <b>uploads</b> the encrypted <b>message</b> and keywords to the cloud. To access encrypted messages containing certain keywords satisfying a search policy, a data user generates a trapdoor for the search policy using his/her private attribute-key and sends it to the cloud server equipped to the cloud. The cloud server searches over encrypted data stored in the cloud for the encrypted messages containing keywords satisfying the search policy and sends back the results to the data user who then decrypts the returned ciphertexts to obtain the underlying messages. We present a generic construction for ABE-EAKS, formally prove its security, give a concrete construction, and then extend the concrete ABE-EAKS scheme to support user revocation. Also, we implement the proposed ABE-EAKS scheme and its extension and study their performance through experiments...|$|R
30|$|The social-aware routing {{algorithms}} often forward {{messages to}} the nodes with high social characteristics according to some metrics, {{in order to make}} the messages to be delivered as soon as possible. Zhao et al. [31] proposed a social-aware probabilistic routing method for mobile opportunistic social networks, in which probabilistic and social-aware strategies were combined and the multiple copy policy was adopted as well. They first modeled a mobile opportunistic social network (MOSN) into some overlapping regions and then proposed two region-related centrality degrees associated with users’ social characteristics. Furthermore, Shi et al. [18] put forward a cache-aware routing scheme in mobile social network, in which interest routing scheme was designed on the basis of the social regularity associated with the proposed interest metrics among nodes, and meanwhile, the data routing scheme was designed on the basis of the proposed closeness metrics among nodes. Correspondingly, based on the proposed friendship metrics among nodes, an in-network caching scheme was designed to deal with the forthcoming requests. Simulation results show that this scheme can achieve better routing performance. Moreover, Zheng and Wu [33] proposed an up-and-down routing algorithm in mobile opportunistic social networks with bloom-filter-based hints. This routing algorithm first exhibited a nested core-periphery structure, and a <b>message</b> could be <b>uploaded</b> from the source to the network core with this structure, through iteratively forwarding the message to a relay that had a higher position in the nested network hierarchy. Additionally, Lindgren et al. [13] proposed a prophet algorithm, in which a node only replicated a message to the nodes with a higher delivery probability to the message’s destination node than itself, although these four routing methods can achieve a competitive performance. However, the nodes with higher social characteristics would consume relatively large energy. If the energy of nodes cannot be replenished in time, the practicality of these three methods would be limited.|$|R
40|$|Online social {{networking}} {{is available to}} {{anyone who wants to}} sign up to the many sites available. The web-based services allow users to communicate with many media sources and to build relationship networks that have personal meaning. The medium permits open communication and, consequently, the propagation of hidden messages (steganography) and the exchange of images, text, sound files and so on, that may contain hidden information. The purpose of this research is to find out {{whether or not it is}} necessary to include steganography as a routine check when conducting digital forensics examinations in relation to online {{social networking}}. This is a challenge to digital forensic investigators as the hidden messages will not be found if they are not being searched for. 	The research testing was carried out in a laboratory environment under an empirical approach. In the pre-test, five steganographic techniques with different image formats were uploaded on Facebook and Google+ social network websites and then downloaded to identify the techniques that can and cannot be used on Facebook and Google+ for the complete process of covert communication up to the extraction of the hidden messages. Two suitable techniques, JP Hide and Seek and StegHide with common JPEG images were chosen for the experimental case scenarios, based on the pre-test results. The experimental case scenarios were simulated on laboratory computers and digital forensic examinations were undertaken to identify both the <b>uploaded</b> hidden <b>messages</b> in different images and to extract the hidden <b>messages</b> in the <b>uploaded</b> and downloaded image files. Based on the digital forensic examination performed on the experimental case scenarios, a guideline for the steganographic examination process was established. 	The findings from the pre-test results showed that steganography is difficult to perform in the Facebook photo upload feature. Here the hidden message cannot be extracted after the image is downloaded from Facebook, but it can be successfully performed through the message file attachment and group file sharing features with a variety of image formats such as JPEG, PNG, BMP, and GIF. On Google+ photo sharing, on the other hand, the complete cycle of steganography communication from embedding up to the extraction of hidden messages was successfully undertaken with JPEG, PNG, BMP or GIF image formats. The results show that steganography can be propagated in social media; therefore it is necessary to include steganographic evaluation in the standard digital investigation procedures. 	It was discovered during the research experiment that there is a lack of effective forensic tools in the area of steganographic image analysis or signature detection. The current steganalysis tools are designed for specific signatures but there are very many steganographic tools that are capable of embedding hidden messages using different techniques. This is a challenge for the digital forensic investigator. Therefore, there is an opportunity for further research in this area where the capabilities of detection tools can be further developed with more steganographic signatures...|$|R
