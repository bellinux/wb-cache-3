50|$|Prior to the automobile, Michigan Central was <b>mostly</b> <b>a</b> <b>carrier</b> {{of natural}} resources. Michigan had {{extensive}} reserves of timber at the time, and the Michigan Central owned lines {{from east to}} west of the state and north to south, tapping all resources available. After the advent of the automobile {{as one of the most}} dominant forces of commerce ever seen by the world, with Detroit at the epicenter, the Michigan Central became a carrier of autos and auto-related parts. The Michigan Central was one of the few Michigan railroads with a direct line into Chicago, meaning it did not have to operate cross-lake ferries, as did virtually all other railroads operating in Michigan, such as the Pere Marquette, Pennsylvania, Grand Trunk, and Ann Arbor Railroads. Michigan Central was part owner of the ferry service operated to the Upper Peninsula as well as cross-river ferry service to Ontario, but these routes did not exist to circumvent Chicago.|$|E
40|$|While DNA is <b>mostly</b> <b>a</b> primary <b>carrier</b> {{of genetic}} {{information}} and displays a regular duplex structure, RNA can form very complicated and conserved 3 D structures displaying a large variety of functions, {{such as being}} <b>an</b> intermediary <b>carrier</b> of the genetic information, translating such information into the protein machinery of the cell, or even acting as a chemical catalyst. At the base of such functional diversity is the subtle balance between different backbone, nucleobase, and ribose conformations, finely regulated by the combination of hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions. Although an apparently simple chemical modification, {{the presence of the}} 2 ′OH in RNA has a profound effect in the ribonucleotide conformational balance, adding an extra layer of complexity to the interactions network in RNA. In the present work, we have combined database analysis with extensive molecular dynamics, quantum mechanics, and hybrid QM/MM simulations to provide direct evidence on the dramatic impact of the 2 ′OH conformation on sugar puckering. Calculations provide evidence that proteins can modulate the 2 ′OH conformation to drive sugar repuckering, leading then to the formation of bioactive conformations. In summary, the 2 ′OH group seems to be a primary molecular switch contributing to specific protein–RNA recognition...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, molybdopterin {{cofactor}} (MoCo) able {{to reconstitute}} active nitrate reductase (NR) with apoenzyme from the Neurospora crassa mutant nit- 1 was found <b>mostly</b> bound to <b>a</b> <b>carrier</b> protein (CP). This protein is scarce in the algal free extracts {{and has been}} purified 520 -fold. MoCoCP is a protein of 64 kDa with subunits of 16. 5 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4. 5. In contrast to free MoCo, MoCo bound to CP was remarkably protected against inactivation under both aerobic conditions and basic pH. MocoCP transferred active MoCo to apoNR in vitro without addition of molybdate, though reconstituted activity was 20 % higher {{in the presence of}} molybdate. Incubation with tungstate specifically inhibited MoCoCP activity but had no effect on the activity of free MoCo released from milk xanthine oxidase. MoCoCP did not charge molybdate unless in the presence of N. crassa extracts. Our data support that MoCoCP stabilizes MoCo in an active form charged with molybdate to provide MoCo to apomolybdoenzymes...|$|R

40|$|Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {{has been}} <b>mostly</b> {{considered}} as <b>a</b> <b>carrier</b> of genetic information and gene expression. Recently, we {{have demonstrated that}} this biomacromolecule is very effective in providing cellulosic fabrics with flame retardant features, thanks to its intrinsic intumescent-like behaviour. Here, we have investigated {{the role played by}} different parameters on the overall flame retardant features: DNA molecular size, pH of the DNA aqueous solutions, and number of impregnations. For this purpose, herring DNA, at three different molecular sizes, low (100 - 200 base pairs, bp), medium (400 - 800 bp) and high (2000 - 10000 bp), has been selected as model biomacromolecule; its effect as fire protective coating on cotton fabrics has been assessed in terms of resistance to a flame application (through horizontal flame spread tests) and to an irradiative heat flux of 35 kW/m 2 (by cone calorimetry). Furthermore, thermogravimetric analyses have been exploited for evaluating thermal and thermo-oxidative stability of the treated fabrics. The results clearly indicate that, despite a similar composition, the coatings containing low molecular size DNA exert a superior fire protection on the fabric substrate, as clearly indicated by horizontal flame spread and cone calorimetry tests. Multiple impregnation treatment {{turned out to be more}} performing than the single one, being equal the final add-on achieved. More specifically, the use of multiple impregnations at pH= 4 and 8 allowed achieving self-extinction for 86 and 74 % of the tested samples; in addition, 45 and 25 % reductions of total heat release and heat release rate peak under 35 kW/m 2 have been found with respect to untreated cotton. These findings may be attributed to themorphology of the low molecular size DNA coating, which shows a greater penetration into the microfibrillar surfaces of the component fibres within the fabric and to its higher thermal stability in ai...|$|R
