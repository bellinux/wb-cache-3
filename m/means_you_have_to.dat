25|$|The outer part of {{the double}} coat should be {{straight}} and wiry in texture, never soft, silky, curly, wavy, or woolly {{as might be expected}} in the Kerry Blue Terrier. The coat should lie flat against the skin, and, though having some length, should never be so long as to hide the true shape of the dog. There are longer hairs on the legs, but never so much as a Wire Fox Terrier or Schnauzer. That <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have the coat trimmed often which can be expensive.|$|E

Following this disaster, Homer then cheers up Burns {{by pointing out that}} being loved <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be nice to people everyday but being hated means {{you do not have to}} do anything. Burns agrees with that logic, saying [...] "I'm a selfish old crank--and that fits me like a Speedo!"

2500|$|This {{interest}} in education continued into her opera career. For many years, Blackwell {{participated in a}} program called the [...] "Affiliate Artists" [...] where {{she went into the}} community and talked to people one-on-one to educate them about and inspire {{interest in}} opera. Blackwell says, [...] "We don't have audience participation anymore, partly because of being raised on television. We have become an audience that receives entertainment in a passive way. I think in order to participate you have to have knowledge and knowledge <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take the time to sit down and educate. When you are able to communicate with people and show them you're just another human being with a gift, it makes all the difference. My gift happens to be singing. When you go to an opera you see so many people, but you don't have an opportunity to have that one-on-one contact and that's what was so great about that program." ...|$|E

It does not <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> subject yourself {{to a life of}} hardship and abstinence. On the contrary, to be enlightened means to live in the light of love, compassion and truthfulness," [...] Swami says.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{is that it}} <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make a decision. You either have a fish, or you cut it up into bait to catch more fish. This means to make a decision. Take what you have (a fish) or lose it and decide {{to use it to}} get more.|$|E
50|$|I think print {{can be very}} reactive. It {{just means}} getting {{on the end of}} a phone and getting a quote. For TV it doesn't happen unless it's filmed and that <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be there. Our {{particular}} brand is called Show Me television - we don't tell you, we show you.|$|E
50|$|This {{is a new}} module and at {{the moment}} in an {{experimental}} status. It supports only about XXXXX litres a day, which <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> use more of these modules in parallel operation. But the benefits are you can have more, smaller water plants which reduces long transport ways, it uses less space and weight in transportation and it's also cheaper.|$|E

5000|$|To clarify, {{the visual}} n-back test {{is similar to}} the classic memory game of [...] "Concentration". However, instead of {{different}} items that are in a fixed location on the game board, there is only one item, that appears in different positions on the game board during each turn. [...] "1-N" [...] <b>means</b> that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> remember the position of the item, one turn back. [...] "2-N" [...] <b>means</b> that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> remember the position of the item two turns back, and so on.|$|R
5000|$|On {{her choice}} of roles, Rampling said, [...] "I {{generally}} don't make films to entertain people. I choose the parts that challenge me to break through my own barriers. A need to devour, punish, humiliate or surrender {{seems to be a}} primal part of human nature, and it's certainly a big part of sex.

50|$|At {{the eastern}} end of the village is Dilton Marsh Railway Station, a simple railway {{platform}} on the regional line. It is the subject of the John Betjeman poem Dilton Marsh Halt. This is a request stop which <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ask the conductor to stop there, and when you want to get on a train you hold your hand as if hailing a taxi; you will have to pay on board as there are no facilities to pay at the platform.|$|E

5000|$|Hinton {{moved with}} his {{extended}} family to Chicago, Illinois {{in the fall}} of 1919, which created opportunities for him. Chicago was where Hinton first encountered economic diversity among African-Americans, about which he later noted, [...] "That's when I realized that being black didn't always <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be poor." [...] It was also where he experienced an abundance of music, either in person or through live performances on the radio.

It also has larger counters. Character sheets were introduced to track damage, life counters, power-down status, and program cards. Each sheet also contains {{a copy of the}} turn sequence for reference. The graphics have been redesigned to make the functionality of board elements clearer. The rules were also simplified to remove the concept of virtual robots.|$|E

50|$|Interchange Joure, where A6 meets E22, that is {{concurrent}} with A7 there, {{is currently}} build as a traffic circle. It has no grade separated parts {{which results in}} some traffic being favoured over other traffic. This is why a new interchange is being constructed between 2015 and 2017, which will be half a stack interchange. It will be placed southwest of the current traffic circle and traffic from A6 from the south will get onto A7 without having to use an exit, thus being the dominant route. When arriving from the west on A7/E22, this <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> use ramps to stay on A7/E22. A new exit, Joure, will be created just south of where the current traffic circle is now, since an exit used to be incorporated in the traffic circle.|$|E

[...] Pocket Gamer UK wrote [...] "Cute but incredibly difficult, Penumbear oozes brooding malice and will cause {{a great deal of}} frustration - but the unique gameplay is tight and appealing enough to keep you enthralled." [...] TouchGen said [...] "Penumbear is a quality puzzle platformer with a lot of content, and unsettling presentation. It never feels casual, and finding all the hidden stuff <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be prepared to have Penumbear impaled on spikes quite a lot. Not a game for the kiddies, but rather a game for those into darker games such as Limbo, Nihilumbra or Oscura." ...|$|E

However, not knowing that [...] "getting pubes" [...] <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> grow them yourself, he only has pubic hair because he bought a handful of it from eighth-grader Scott Tenorman for $10. Outraged at having been conned, instead of {{learning}} his lesson, Cartman desperately tries various methods to get his money back, but is constantly outwitted by Scott. He even loses an additional $6.12 in the process. After Scott makes Cartman beg for the money and sing that he is a [...] "little piggy", Scott, not knowing how evil Cartman can be, burns the money in front of him, after which Cartman starts to plot revenge. He attempts to train a pony to bite off Scott's penis, but Jimbo later tells him {{that the best way to}} humiliate Scott is to find his weaknesses.|$|E

Though loathing girls his own age, Beaver develops crushes on schoolteachers Miss Canfield and Miss Landers, and in one episode says he's going to marry a [...] "mother" [...] when the time comes.
