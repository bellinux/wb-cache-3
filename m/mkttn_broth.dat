40|$|A sixth {{bacteriological}} {{collaborative study}} was organised by the Community Reference Laboratory for Salmonella (CRL-Salmonella, Bilthoven, The Netherlands) in 2002. Seventeen National Reference Laboratories for Salmonella (NRLs-Salmonella) {{participated in the}} study. Reference materials in combination {{with or without the}} presence of chicken faeces, as well as naturally contaminated faecal samples (containing Salmonella Infantis) were tested by all laboratories. The reference materials existed of gelatin capsules containing Salmonella Typhimurium (STM), Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) or Salmonella Panama (SPan) at different contamination levels. In addition to the performance testing of the laboratories a comparison was made between the media described in the amended ISO 6579 : 2002 [Rappaport Vassiliadis Soya Broth (RVS), Mueller Kauffmann Tetrathionate-novobiocin <b>broth</b> (<b>MKTTn)</b> and Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate agar (XLD) ] and the alternative media Modified Semi-solid Rappaport Vassiliadis (MSRV) and Brilliant Green Agar (BGA). Significantly more positive isolations were obtained from capsules containing STM than from capsules containing SE, irrespective of the contamination level or method. The overall results of all different capsules as well as the results of the naturally contaminated samples revealed better results for MSRV (with BGA and XLD as plating-out media) in comparison with the ISO 6579 : 2002 method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Animal feed as {{a source}} of {{infection}} to food producing animals is much debated. In order to increase our present knowledge about possible feed transmission {{it is important to know}} that the present isolation methods for Salmonella are reliable also for feed materials. In a comparative study the ability of the standard method used for isolation of Salmonella in feed in the Nordic countries, the NMKL 71 method (Nordic Committee on Food Analysis) was compared to the Modified Semisolid Rappaport Vassiliadis method (MSRV) and the international standard method (EN ISO 6579 : 2002). Five different feed materials were investigated, namely wheat grain, soybean meal, rape seed meal, palm kernel meal, pellets of pig feed and also scrapings from a feed mill elevator. Four different levels of the Salmonella serotypes S. Typhimurium, S. Cubana and S. Yoruba were added to each feed material, respectively. For all methods pre-enrichment in Buffered Peptone Water (BPW) were carried out followed by enrichments in the different selective media and finally plating on selective agar media. Results The results obtained with all three methods showed no differences in detection levels, with an accuracy and sensitivity of 65 % and 56 %, respectively. However, MÃ¼ller-Kauffmann tetrathionate-novobiocin <b>broth</b> (<b>MKTTn),</b> performed less well due to many false-negative results on Brilliant Green agar (BGA) plates. Compared to other feed materials palm kernel meal showed a higher detection level with all serotypes and methods tested. Conclusion The results of this study showed that the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the investigated cultural methods were equivalent. However, the detection levels for different feed and feed ingredients varied considerably. </p...|$|R
40|$|The European National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) for Salmonella {{were able}} to detect high {{and low levels of}} Salmonella in a ring trial using minced beef as matrix, thereby {{reaching}} the level of good performance. The Modified Semi-solid Rappaport Vassiliadis (MSRV), a method often used for the detection of Salmonella in animal faeces, {{turned out to be the}} best method for minced beef. This was one outcome of the inter-laboratory comparison study organized by the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) for Salmonella on the detection of Salmonella spp. in a food matrix in September 2006. The first, and most important goal, was to see if the 25 participating laboratories in this study could detect Salmonella in minced beef. The second goal was to compare the different analysis methods for the detection of Salmonella in minced beef. Each laboratory received a package containing minced beef and 35 gelatin capsules containing different levels of Salmonella. According to the instructions, the laboratories spiked the meat with the capsules and tested those samples for the presence of Salmonella. The laboratories used three methods for running this test: Rappaport Vassiliadis Soya broth (RVS), Mueller Kauffmann Tetrathionate novobiocin <b>broth</b> (<b>MKTTn)</b> and Modified Semi-solid Rappaport Vassiliadis (MSRV). The first two methods are internationally prescribed for the detection of Salmonella in food, while the third (MSRV) is prescribed for the detection of Salmonella in veterinary faeces. All laboratories found Salmonella in just 88 % of the samples using one of the food methods (MKTTn). The method for the veterinary samples, MSRV, gave the best results, with 99 % of all laboratories detecting Salmonella in the spiked samples. The MKTTn food method is therefore not the optimal medium for the detection of Salmonella in minced beef...|$|R

De Europese Nationale Referentie Laboratoria (NRLs) voor Salmonella hebben in een ringonderzoek hoge en lage concentraties Salmonella aangetoond in rundergehakt. Hiermee hebben ze laten zien dat ze voldoen aan de gestelde eisen. De Modified Semi-solid Rappaport Vassiliadis (MSRV), een analysemethode die veel gebruikt wordt voor Salmonella in dierenmest, bleek de beste methode voor het aantonen van Salmonella in rundergehakt. Vijfentwintig referentielaboratoria deden in september 2006 mee aan een ringonderzoek van het Communautair Referentie Laboratorium (CRL) voor Salmonella. Doel was in eerste instantie om na te gaan of de laboratoria Salmonella in gehakt goed konden aantonen. In tweede instantie werd ook onderzocht wat de beste analysemethode was voor het aantonen van Salmonella in rundergehakt. Ieder laboratorium kreeg een pakket toegestuurd met rundergehakt en 35 gelatine capsules met melkpoeder van verschillende besmettingsniveaus Salmonella. De laboratoria moesten volgens voorschrift gehakt en capsules samenvoegen en onderzoeken op de aanwezigheid van Salmonella. Voor het onderzoek gebruikten de laboratoria drie methoden: Rappaport Vassiliadis Soya broth (RVS), Mueller Kauffmann Tetrathionaat met novobiocine (MKTTn) en Modified Semi-solid Rappaport Vassiliadis (MSRV). De eerste twee methoden (RVS en MKKTn) staan bekend als internationaal voorgeschreven voor de analyse van Salmonella in levensmiddelen. De derde methode (MSRV) wordt gebruikt om Salmonella in dierlijke mest aan te tonen. Met een van de levensmiddelenmethoden (MKTTn) vonden alle laboratoria in slechts 88 % van de monsters Salmonella. De methode voor dierlijke mest (MSRV) bleek de beste resultaten te geven. Hiermee vonden alle laboratoria in 99 % van de besmette monsters Salmonella. De levensmiddelenmethode MKTTn blijkt dus niet de meest optimale methode te zijn voor het aantonen van Salmonella in rundergehakt...|$|R
