50|$|For silver the {{limiting}} frequency {{is in the}} far UV, but for copper and gold it {{is closer to the}} visible. This explains the colors of these two metals. At the surface of a metal resonance effects known as surface plasmons can result. They are collective oscillations of the conduction electrons like a ripple in the electronic ocean. However, even if photons have enough energy they usually do not have enough momentum to set the ripple in motion. Therefore, plasmons are hard to excite on a bulk metal. This is why gold and copper still look like lustrous metals albeit with a dash of color. However, in colloidal gold the metallic bonding is confined to a tiny <b>metallic</b> <b>particle,</b> preventing the oscillation wave of the plasmon from 'running away'. The momentum selection rule is therefore broken, and the plasmon resonance causes an extremely intense absorption in the green with a resulting beautiful purple-red color. Such colors are orders of magnitude more intense than ordinary absorptions seen in dyes and the like that involve individual electrons and their energy states.|$|E

The insulating strength of solid dielectric spacers sandwiched between electrodes and stressed by AC voltage.

40|$|Plasmonic {{tweezers}} {{and optical}} tweezers are two techniques for trapping and manipulating particles. Plasmonic tweezers utilizes localized surface plasmon field, whilst optical tweezers utilizes focused laser beam. In this thesis, these two techniques were {{applied for the}} manipulation of metallic particles in three basic forms: single particle, particle dimer and particle trimer. Firstly, the trapping of metallic particles was investigated through focused plasmonic tweezers when surface plasmons are excited by focused Radially Polarized Beam (RPB). The force exerted on the <b>metallic</b> <b>particle</b> {{is responsible for the}} trapping, which is found to be due to the sum of both gradient and scattering forces acting in the same direction established by the coupling between the <b>metallic</b> <b>particle</b> and focused plasmonic field. This contrasts the repulsion of metallic particles in optical tweezers. Focused plasmonic trapping of <b>metallic</b> <b>particle</b> enables actively moving <b>metallic</b> <b>particle</b> in a controlled way, which could be used for intracellular Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) imaging. Secondly, the trapping of horizontally-oriented <b>metallic</b> <b>particle</b> dimers was theoretically studied through focused plasmonic tweezers when surface plasmons are excited by focused linearly-polarized beam. It was found that a Surface Plasmon Virtual Probe (SP-VP) pair was generated on a metal film. A formula is derived to represent the electric field of SP-VP pair, revealing that the spacing of the two virtual probes is wavelength-dependent. Each SP-VP is able to trap a <b>metallic</b> <b>particle,</b> thus the gap between the trapped particles of the dimer can be controlled by changing the excitation wavelength. This theory was further tested by successfully trapping nanosphere and nanorod metallic dimers with 10 nm gaps. The trapped dimer showed a typical electric field enhancement of more than 103 times, which is enough for single molecule SERS detection. Thirdly, a vertically-oriented dimer structure was proposed based on trapping of metallic nanoparticle by focused plasmonic tweezers. The vertically-oriented dimer can effectively make use of the dominant longitudinal component of the SP-VP thus providing much stronger electric field in the gap. Furthermore, for practical application the top nanoparticle of the dimer can be replaced with the tip of an atomic force microscope which enables the precise control of the gap distance of the dimer. Therefore the proposed vertically-oriented dimer structure provides both the scanning capability and the extremely-high electric field enhancement necessary for the high sensitivity Raman imaging. Lastly, the stable trapping and steady rotation of a <b>metallic</b> <b>particle</b> trimer were experimentally achieved by optical tweezers with optical vortex. The trimer particles are found to be confined inside the maximum intensity ring of a focused circularly polarized optical vortex. Theoretical analysis suggests that {{a large proportion of the}} radial scattering force pushes the particles together, whilst the remaining portion provides the centripetal force necessary for the rotation. The achieved steady rotation of the <b>metallic</b> <b>particle</b> trimer may lead to the development of microfluidics devices such as micro-rotor...|$|E
40|$|<b>Metallic</b> <b>particles</b> can be {{detrimental}} when {{present in the}} atmosphere, because they could contribute to global climate change through direct atmospheric absorption and reduction of snow albedo. There have also been links between the presence of iron-oxide particles {{in the brain and}} Alzheimer’s diseaseA, suggesting <b>metallic</b> <b>particles</b> as a potentially important air pollutant that is not currently well-characterized. The ability to detect these particles in real time will help further our understanding of them. Single particle soot photometers (SP 2) are primarily used to measure black carbon, but can be modified to measure and characterize <b>metallic</b> <b>particles,</b> as indicated in a previous studyB. Modifications to the SP 2, including the addition of optical filters to the incandescent channels, were made in an attempt to better distinguish <b>metallic</b> <b>particles</b> and black carbon. The addition of the optical filters appears to be unnecessary for distinguishing <b>metallic</b> <b>particles.</b> The incandescence efficiencies of different <b>metallic</b> <b>particles</b> were also analyzed to assess the practicality of measuring these particles in the atmosphere. Ambient air sampled in Boulder, CO showed a small amount of metallic pollution, between 2 ± 2 % of the total mass of measured incandescent particles. Reliable measurements of <b>metallic</b> <b>particles</b> would help us better understand the quantity and type of <b>metallic</b> <b>particles</b> in the atmosphere, which can then be used to study their effects on climate and human health.

The electric field characteristic in three-phase GIS is different from that in single-phase one. There are periodic changes in the electric field magnitude and direction produced by three-phase voltage at any point.

The rotating characteristics of the electric field vector in three-phase power apparatus depended on the position inside the insulation of the tank. The electric field vector locus is circular, elliptic, or linear. The elliptical nature of rotating electric field is expressed as electric field ratio.
