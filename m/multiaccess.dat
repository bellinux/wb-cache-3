40|$|Abstract — This paper {{studies the}} diversity-multiplexing {{tradeoff}} for the <b>multiaccess</b> relay channel (MARC) with static, flat fading. It develops two simple strategies, namely <b>multiaccess</b> amplify-and-forward (MAF) and <b>multiaccess</b> decode-andforward (MDF), {{that help the}} users gain the benefit of cooperative diversity without changes in their devices. Results suggest that in the regime of light system loads, both strategies offer improved performance to each user as if no other users interfere or contend for the relay. However, they are inferior to the optimal dynamic decode forward (DDF) protocol in this regime. In the regime of heavy loads, the MARC with MAF offers better performance, and MARC with MDF degenerates into the <b>multiaccess</b> channel (MAC) without a relay. Moreover, the MAF protocol is optimal in the regime of high multiplexing. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{studies the}} Gaussian <b>multiaccess</b> channel with multiantenna basestation {{in the low}} signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime. We compare the {{spectral}} efficiencies of the optimal superposition channel sharing scheme and two simple alternatives: the time division <b>multiaccess</b> (TDMA) scheme and superposition <b>multiaccess</b> with single-user decoding (SSD). Due to the fact that SSD, but not TDMA, exploits the multiuser multiplexing gain, the relative spectral efficiency of SSD over TDMA grows drastically as the number of antennas at the basestation increases. The results suggest that, in the low SNR regime with multiple antenna basestation, TDMA’s suboptimality can no longer be offset by its simplicity since SSD can achieve much higher spectral efficiency while the simplicities of the two channel sharing schemes are similar.

40|$|Abstract—Recently, several linear {{receiver}} algorithms {{have been developed}} for space-time block-coded <b>multiaccess</b> multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems. All these techniques are {{based on the assumption that}} the channel state information (CSI) at the receiver side is perfect.

In this paper, we develop new robust {{linear receiver}} techniques for joint space-time decoding and interference rejection in <b>multiaccess</b> MIMO systems that use orthogonal space-time block codes and erroneous CSI. The proposed receivers are based on worstcase performance optimization.

40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} problem of optimal {{resource}} allocation for multi-user <b>multiaccess</b> wireless video communication from an information-theoretic point of view. We derive the optimal resource allocation policies by directly maximizing at the application layer the weighted sum of video qualities of all users, subject to information-theoretic <b>multiaccess</b> capacity region constraints in the MAC-PHY layers. We solve this problem for three <b>multiaccess</b> capacity regions: 1) non-fading channel, 2) fading channel with a given power control policy, and 3) fading channel with dynamic power control policies. The optimal resource allocation policy is referred as Largest Quality Improvement Highest Possible Rate (LQIHPR). We propose simple greedy algorithms to implement this policy. Since the capacity region is the fundamental characterization of the achievable rates, the solutions developed in this paper provide the operational upper bound of achievable video quality in a <b>multiaccess</b> fading channel.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{demonstrates}} a high-performance optical-code-division-multiple-access (O-CDMA) network testbed using the spectral phase encoded time spreading (SPECTS) method. Through additional time and polarization multiplexing, {{a total of}} 32 10 -Gb/s users are supported while sharing eight O-CDMA spreading codes. User detection is achieved with time gating and nonlinear thresholding to suppress the <b>multiaccess</b> interference of other users. Incorporation of forward error correction success-fully reduces the performance loss imposed by coherent beat in-terference, resulting in error-free performance (BER < 10 − 11), significant per-user power penalty reduction, {{and the elimination of}} a bit-error-rate noise floor. The testbed also applies bandwidth suppression within the encoders and decoders, yielding a 52 % increase in spectral efficiency.
