5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert started {{developing}} {{what came to}} be known as the Society of Mind theory which views biological brain as massively parallel computer. In 1986, Minsky published The Society of Mind, which claims that “mind is formed from <b>many</b> <b>little</b> agents, each mindless by itself”. The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non-intelligent parts. Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a video camera, and a computer to build with children's blocks.|$|E

They are, our {{mortality}} and the facing of imminent death; our groundlessness in that {{we are unable to}} grasp the solution to the enigma of existence, see the beginning or end of time, nor put off the discovery of the meaning of life; our insatiability in that we always want more, and demand the infinite from the finite; and our susceptibility to belittlement which places us in a position to constantly confront petty routine forcing us to die <b>many</b> <b>little</b> deaths.|$|E
25|$|Hekhalot ("Heavenly Palaces") are not {{a single}} text. Rather, they are a genre of {{writings}} with shared characteristics. These texts primarily focus either on how to achieve a heavenly ascent through the Heichalot (heavenly palaces) and what to expect there, or on drawing down angelic spirits to interact and help the adept. There are several larger documents of the heichalot, such as Hekhalot Rabbati, in which six of the seven palaces of God are described, Hekhalot Zutarti, Shiur Komah and 6th-century 3 Enoch, as well as hundreds of small documents, <b>many</b> <b>little</b> more than fragments.|$|E

25|$|As I {{walked down}} {{at this place}} I was walled on both sides by those {{inaccessible}} high rocky barren hills which hang over one’s head in some places and appear very terrible; and from them springs <b>many</b> <b>little</b> currents {{of water from the}} sides and clefts which trickle down to some lower part where it runs swiftly over the stones and shelves in the way, which makes a pleasant rush and murmuring noise and like a snowball is increased by each spring trickling down on either side of those hills, and so descends into the bottoms which are a Moorish ground in which in many places the waters stand, and so form some of those Lakes as it did here.|$|E
25|$|Two {{troops were}} sent to try and check this {{movement}} long enough to allow the right flank of the brigade to be withdrawn; brigade headquarters and every man of ‘B’ Battery H.A.C. that could be spared joined this fight. The 4th and 12th Light Horse Regiments formed into <b>many</b> <b>little</b> columns of led horses and began moving in single file {{along the side of}} the steep hills. Their movement soon turned into something of a race as the German and Ottoman attackers marched on the plain and the light horsemen lead their horses through the hills. These light horsemen arrived in time to reinforce the squadron of 11th Light Horse Regiment which had been driven to a position in the foothills almost due east of Red Hill, with their left extended towards the river. There a strong firing line was rapidly built up and the German and Ottoman advance checked.|$|E

500|$|Reviews from {{critics were}} mostly strong, with many {{saying that the}} {{extended}} length of gameplay and the new features were valued additions that kept the sequels as interesting as the original games. Craig Harris of IGN gave the games a [...] "masterful" [...] 10 out of 10 rating, stating that: [...] "As awesome as the original Pokémon edition was, Pokémon Gold and Silver blow it away in gameplay elements, features, and goodies. There are so <b>many</b> <b>little</b> additions to the design it's impossible to list them all". There was particular praise given to the innovative internal clock feature, with Frank Povo of GameSpot, noting: [...] "The first major addition to Pokémon GS {{is the presence of}} a time element... Although it may sound like a gimmick, the addition of a clock adds quite a bit of variety to the game". Povo went on to give the games a [...] "great" [...] 8.8 rating. Nintendo Power listed the Gold and Silver versions of it combined as the sixth best Game Boy/Game Boy Color video game, praising it for its new Pokémon, features, and full-color graphics.|$|E
500|$|Gerstmann {{called the}} quality FMV [...] "a small victory {{in a larger}} conflict", saying the game had [...] "too <b>many</b> <b>little</b> {{problems}} to recommend it" [...] and that it [...] "simply doesn't play {{as well as the}} old 16-bit Strike games." [...] Sega Saturn Magazine called it a [...] "worthy addition" [...] to the series and also noted improvements to the Saturn version. GameFan said the game [...] "is everything you could wish for from a 32bit Strike" [...] and that [...] "it plays brilliantly, and exercises both your trigger finger and grey matter." [...] The magazine later reflected that the Saturn version was somewhat better but nevertheless very similar to the PlayStation original. It recommended the game to Strike fans but felt it would be an [...] "in at the deep end" [...] introduction for newcomers to the series. Edge summarised: [...] "this is a fairly well-engineered continuation of the four-year-old Strike series", which retains the gameplay of the original but updates the graphics to true 3D. GamePro felt the game might be too slow for fans of faster paced action games, but recommended it for players of previous instalments in the series. Allgame later felt: [...] "The series peaked with the release of Soviet Strike." ...|$|E
500|$|The flags were {{originally}} a white [...] "W" [...] {{on a blue}} flag and a blue [...] "L" [...] on a white flag. This matched {{what was then the}} color scheme of the Cubs [...] "team flags" [...] that flew on the foul poles, and the <b>many</b> <b>little</b> [...] "W.F." [...] flags that flew on the grandstand roof (all of them serving to give the players a sense of the wind speed and direction). Ernie Banks was the first Cub to have his number retired on August 22, 1982, and his number 14 has been flown in blue on a white flag (echoing the pattern of a Cubs home uniform shirt) on the left field foul pole ever since. On August 13, 1987, Billy Williams had his number retired and it flew with the same color scheme, on the right field foul pole. The scheme of the Cubs Win flag was reversed in the early 1980s. The change in the flag color scheme matched the Win flag color with the honored colors of the retired number flags, as the white-on-blue Cubs [...] "team flag" [...] was retired. Subsequent retired Cubs numbers for Ron Santo, Ryne Sandberg and Ferguson Jenkins/Greg Maddux also match this color scheme.|$|E

The {{critic for the}} London Evening Standard {{considered}} that Isabella had earned herself a household reputation, remarking that she had [...] "succeeded in producing a volume which will be, for years to come, a treasure to be made much of in every English household". The critic for the Saturday Review wrote that [...] "for a really valuable repertory of hints on all sorts of household matters, we recommend Mrs Beeton with few misgivings". The anonymous reviewer for The Bradford Observer considered that [...] "the information afforded... appears intelligible and explicit"; the reviewer also praised {{the layout of the}} recipes, highlighting details relating to ingredients, seasonality and the times needed. Writing in The Morning Chronicle, an anonymous commentator opined that [...] "Mrs Beeton has omitted nothing which tends to the comfort of housekeepers, or facilitates the <b>many</b> <b>little</b> troubles and cares that fall to the lot of every wife and mother. She may safely predict that this book will in future take precedence of every other on the same subject." [...] For the 1906 edition of the book, The Illustrated London Newss reviewer considered the work [...] "a formidable body of domestic doctrine", and thought that [...] "the book is almost of the first magnitude".|$|E
500|$|In 1823, {{when he was}} 10, Verdi's parents {{arranged}} for the boy to attend school in Busseto, enrolling him in a Ginnasio—an upper school for boys—run by Don Pietro Seletti, while they continued to run their inn at Le Roncole. Verdi returned to Busseto regularly to play the organ on Sundays, covering the distance of several kilometres on foot. At age 11, Verdi received schooling in Italian, Latin, the humanities, and rhetoric. By {{the time he was}} 12, he began lessons with Ferdinando Provesi, maestro di cappella at San Bartolomeo, director of the municipal music school and co-director of the local Società Filarmonica (Philharmonic Society). Verdi later stated: [...] "From the ages of 13 to 18 I wrote a motley assortment of pieces: marches for band by the hundred, perhaps as <b>many</b> <b>little</b> sinfonie that were used in church, in the theatre and at concerts, five or six concertos and sets of variations for pianoforte, which I played myself at concerts, many serenades, cantatas (arias, duets, very many trios) and various pieces of church music, of which I remember only a Stabat Mater." [...] This information comes from the Autobiographical Sketch which Verdi dictated to the publisher Giulio Ricordi late in life, in 1879, and remains the leading source for his early life and career. Written, understandably, with the benefit of hindsight, it is not always reliable when dealing with issues more contentious than those of his childhood.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from July 23, 1910. It states: [...] "Bella is an immigrant girl doing sweatshop work in the ghetto of a great city. But by saving for some time, she manages to get enough money to send to the old country for her two little sisters. She meets them at Ellis Island and escorts them across Battery Park to their new home. The three girls live with an uncle and aunt in one poor room in a tenement. The smallest of the sisters while playing on the sidewalk one day gets lost and suddenly finds herself in Chinatown. She is dismayed at the entirely strange surroundings, and is weeping bitterly when found by John Magie, a young settlement worker. He dries her tears and takes her safely to her sweatshop home. John is at once attracted by Bella, whom he meets {{for the first time}} when he brings the little one back. He does the family <b>many</b> <b>little</b> kindnesses, bringing them flowers and books, and induces the girls to attend the classes at the settlement. While teaching his class one evening, John is suddenly attacked with a fever, which is epidemic at that time. All his pupils flee from him in fear, except Bella, who remains and nurses him back to health. Upon his recovery John makes Bella his wife and they take up together the work of bringing knowledge and happiness to the poor of the East Side [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Young fruit {{bodies of}} H.bakerensis have rounded caps with cottony margins that are rolled inward; as the {{mushrooms}} mature the caps flatten {{out and the}} margins may lift upward. The diameter of the cap reaches between [...] The center of the cap is colored yellow-brown, tawny or amber, reducing to nearly white at the margin. The cap surface is slimy when wet, and sticky as it gets older and dries out. Beneath the slime layer are hairs that are plastered tightly to the surface, which clump together a few {{at a time to}} form <b>many</b> <b>little</b> streaks. The firm white flesh of the cap is thick— near the stem attachment—and tapers evenly to the margin. It does not change color when cut or bruised. It has a mild taste and a characteristic fragrant odor that resembles almonds, or [...] "crushed peach pits". The waxy gills are decurrent or bluntly attached to the stem. The gill spacing is close to subdistant—between 56–88 individual gills reach the stem, with 2–3 tiers of short lamellulae (shorter gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem). The gills have even edges, and are narrow but become broad in large caps (8–12mm), ranging in color from creamy white to pinkish-buff. They do not discolor when they are bruised. Young specimens often have drops of a clear liquid beaded on the gills. The gills of dried specimens darken considerably. The stem is [...] long, [...] thick at the apex, solid (i.e., not hollow), and either equal in width throughout or narrowed downward. Its color is white to pale pinkish-buff, with a dry surface. The top portion of young specimens have a cottony, fine whitish powder near the top, but this sloughs off as it matures. Like the gills, the top of the stem is often beaded with drops of translucent liquid in moist weather.|$|E
