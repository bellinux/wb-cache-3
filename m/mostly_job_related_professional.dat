The influence of humor on interpersonal relationship and behavior has been considered by various enterprises. In this work, we report that adaptive humor styles employed by leader buffers <b>job</b> <b>related</b> positive affective well-being of employees whereas maladaptive humor styles employed by leaders buffers <b>job</b> <b>related</b> negative affective well-being of employees. Our results indicate that self-enhancing humor {{played a key role in}} leadership at workplace. This helps us to acquire evidence for the self-enhancing humor enhanced <b>job</b> <b>related</b> positive affective well-being of employees. On the other hand, aggressive humor showed a positive but small effect on <b>job</b> <b>related</b> negative affective well-being of employees. The study aims to shed light on humor which can be considered as a precursor of <b>job</b> <b>related</b> affective well-being of employees.

40|$|Introduction: Stress {{levels of}} Dutch nurses {{have been found}} to {{increase}} since 2005. There is evidence that personal resources such as coping style and social support influence <b>job</b> <b>related</b> stress. However when formulating policy to reduce such stress, specific jobrelated factors must also be considered. The aim {{of the study was to}} gain insight into such job-related factors determining <b>job</b> <b>related</b> stress. Methods and Materials: The study population was made up of members from a nationally representative research sample referred to as the Nursing Staff Panel. Candidates for the Nursing Staff Panel were recruited from a random sample of employees. The Panel consists of Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) and Registered Nurses (RNs). In 2009, 628 respondents completed a postal structured questionnaire about their work (response rate 66 %). First, all bivariate relationships between <b>job</b> <b>related</b> stress and possible predictors were examined. Than we included stepwise blocks of variables into regression analyses, starting with <b>job</b> <b>related</b> variables, then individual (background) characteristics and finally adding health care sector. Changes in explained variance were used to determine the unique additional contribution of each block. Results: The tested model explained about half of the variance within <b>job</b> <b>related</b> stress. <b>Job</b> <b>related</b> factors played a major role. <b>Job</b> <b>related</b> stress was mainly associated with four factors: the perceived quality of nursing care within the ward, the autonomy, workload and the perceived appreciation of the nursing staff by others within the organization. Individual determinants explained only 1 % of the variance. Nursing staff members working 20 – 30 h per week experienced less stress than those working < 20 or more than 30 h per week. Conclusion: Attempts to reduce <b>job</b> <b>related</b> stress is not only a matter of reducing workload. Enhancing the quality of patient care directly reduces stress levels, as well as giving nurses more autonomy and appreciation. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Psychology, Washington State UniversityCurrent {{research}} on workplace psychological aggression (WPA) is fragmented, with some researchers stressing {{the importance of}} studying unique constructs and others emphasizing the similarities among constructs {{and the need to}} unify the theory of WPA. To date, no research has empirically examined the similarities and uniqueness of WPA constructs. This study addressed the current gap in research by examining the overlap of commonly studied WPA constructs (i. e., bullying, incivility, and abusive supervision) in terms of factor structure, outcomes, and context. Results from this cross-sectional survey study using a sample of n = 750 working college students suggest there is a substantial degree of overlap among measures of bullying, incivility, and abusive supervision (with the supervisor referent removed). Specifically, results indicated a single higher order factor accounted for a significant and substantial proportion of the variance in measures of bullying, incivility, and abusive supervision. There was a similar pattern of relationships between each WPA construct and <b>job</b> <b>related</b> attitudes and perceptions. The commonly cited contextual differences among bullying, incivility, and abusive supervision (i. e., perceived harmful intent, duration, and primary perpetrator status) were similar across constructs and did not consistently moderate the relationships between each WPA construct and <b>job</b> <b>related</b> attitudes and perceptions. Current {{research on}} WPA is also fragmented with regards to the direct and indirect effect of WPA on <b>job</b> <b>related</b> outcomes. Although many theoretical models of WPA suggest that affect is a mediator of the relationship between WPA and <b>job</b> <b>related</b> outcomes, the majority of empirical studies only examine direct effects. This study empirically examined affective reactions to bullying, incivility, and abusive supervision as a mediator of the relationship between these WPA constructs and <b>job</b> <b>related</b> attitudes and perceptions. Results indicated affective reactions to WPA were a mediator of all significant relationships between WPA constructs and <b>job</b> <b>related</b> attitudes and perceptions. Further, affective reactions were a more consistent predictor of <b>job</b> <b>related</b> attitudes and perceptions than bullying, incivility, and abusive supervision.

We hypothesized that physiotherapists are significantly different from non-health <b>related</b> <b>professionals</b> in a) Health Locus of Control and b) physical activity levels as measured by activPALTM (PAL Technologies Ltd) and that physical activity levels are significantly correlated with Health Locus of Control. A convenience sample of 10 physiotherapists and 10 non-health <b>related</b> <b>professionals</b> completed the Health Locus of Control scale and then was monitored by the activPALTM for 24 hours. The activPALTM's accuracy, test-retest and inter-instrument reliability was tested in a single participant study. Study design, Cross-sectional study.

However, the government may at any time request the student to furnish evidence that each of the jobs that he or she did while on OPT was related to his or her program of study. Since students can be asked to retroactively furnish evidence for jobs that they have already left while on OPT, it is recommended that students maintain documentation for each job of how the <b>job</b> <b>relates</b> to their program of study.
