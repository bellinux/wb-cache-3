50|$|Two {{institutional}} {{efforts to}} manage cattle marketing were attempted in the 1970s and 1980s. The Chadian Animal Resources Improvement Company (Société Tchadienne d'Exploitation des Ressources Animales—SOTERA), a <b>mixed</b> <b>enterprise</b> {{formed as a}} livestock company with participation by some traditional livestock traders, began operations in 1978. Its aim was to control live animal exports through a license system {{and to have a}} monopoly on exports of chilled meat and hides. It was hoped {{at the time that the}} association of traders to SOTERA would increase the effective collection of export taxes on livestock by 50 to 75%. By 1984, however, SOTERA handled only a small portion of the domestic market and less than 30% of the export trade. A second institution, the Center for the Modernization of Animal Production (Centre de Modernisation des Productions Animales—CMPA), was engaged in marketing dairy products, supplying chicks to farmers, and overseeing the sale of eggs and the processing of feed. But, among other problems, the CMPA was unable to compete with local traders for milk needed to produce cheese for sale. Although highly subsidized, this venture also was unsuccessful and demonstrated the resilience of the traditional private network for marketing produce.|$|E

40|$|In Japan, {{many local}} <b>mixed</b> <b>enterprises</b> owned and {{operated}} jointly by local governments and private sectors had been established from the late 1980 ’s to the early 1990 ’s {{in order to provide}} public services more efficiently. At present, in Japan, many local <b>mixed</b> <b>enterprises</b> are confronted with a serial fiscal crisis. In 2007, the national government enacted the Local Public Finance Reconstruction Law and started to lead local <b>mixed</b> <b>enterprises</b> and local governments to achieve fiscal soundness. In addition to local governments, <b>mixed</b> <b>enterprises</b> have to make an effort to operate more efficiently. However, we believe that local <b>mixed</b> <b>enterprises</b> lack the incentives to manage more efficiently because of the governance structure. Firstly, as local <b>mixed</b> <b>enterprises</b> are owned by local governments, they can procure government-guaranteed funds and are able to raise capital more easily. Also, if business conditions of enterprises worsen, local governments give subsidies to bail out ailing enterprises. Managers do {{not have to worry about}} going bankrupt and might continue to carry out inefficient projects. Secondly, if managers are from local governments, or if the majority of the board members are local government officials, they might supply services without putting stress on profit. Therefore, it is possible that the governance structure of local <b>mixed</b> <b>enterprises</b> is the important factor that determines their performance.

Our study {{objective was to}} use an integrated livestock and crop model to assess the outcomes from selected suites of management decisions observed in smallholder sheep-cropping systems of Yucatán, Mexico. The scenarios contrasted specialized systems versus mixed farming, and evaluated the outcomes of increased crop-livestock integration. <b>Mixed</b> <b>enterprise</b> scenarios involving sheep provided more income than specialized enterprises, and capitalized on a lower price of on-farm maize grain, efficient utilization of surplus labor, and availability of common land. Labor and management income was greatest for the unintegrated and partially integrated crop and livestock scenarios. It was more profitable for producers to sell excess grain and maize stover, and use common land to feed the livestock, suggesting that increased integration does not always result in improved outcomes. The {{results are consistent with}} a system not yet pushed to the point where integration is inevitable. For all sets of scenarios, the model structure was able to accommodate subtle management differences to produce appropriate biophysical, labor, and economic outcomes.

40|$|The {{improvement}} of water {{quality in the}} streams of the Glenelg Hopkins catchment is a priority of the Glenelg Hopkins regional strategy. A major source of water pollution {{in the region is}} linked to agricultural activities as high nutrient levels from runoff have the potential to increase the incidence of blue-green algae in the waterways. Land use change, reduced rainfall, more frequent extreme rainfall events and higher temperatures associated with climate change are likely to exacerbate this trend. Water testing data of the Total Phosphorus (TP) levels in the Hopkins River and at other sites within the Hopkins Catchment indicate increasing incidence of TP above the Environment Protection Authority&# 039;s target levels for extended periods of each year. Earlier research indicated that phosphorus in runoff increases when pasture fertility increases and that fertiliser management practices should be considered as an element of preventative action for reducing nutrient pollution. During our research, a survey was undertaken in the Hopkins River catchment, to determine the current management of phosphorus (P) fertilisers on grazing and <b>mixed</b> <b>enterprise</b> farms, the attitude of farmers to natural resource management and their understanding of nutrient pollution. The survey also gathered information on the way farmers made fertiliser management decisions. If cooperation relating to phosphorus fertiliser application could be facilitated between groups of farmers, {{it may be possible to}} reduce nutrient runoff into the Hopkins waterways. Cooperative game theory has successfully been used worldwide in the resolution of environmental problems where there is an economic impact to the decision making process. In this project, the amount of phosphorus applied per hectare was used in a cooperative game theory model assessing the potential for cooperative action on phosphorus management by groups of farmers, based on the trade off between the economic cost of pollution to the region waterways and the economic production benefits to the individual. The outcome of this work was individual optimal strategies for fertiliser application, allowing individual farmers to reduce their impact of agricultural production on the health of the catchment. Involving the farmer groups, while undertaking the project, raised awareness amongst the farming population of the regional nutrient pollution caused by runoff from agricultural land, and enlisted their assistance towards adopting a cooperative approach to the problem.

The comparison between the country of the ex-bloc soviet and states of Western Europe is used to define the level of cohesion in the European sector of housing, of territorial management and to define the similarities and differences relating to issues that concern the new residential urbanization and management of the existing housing stock among the countries of East and West, in the context of European policies more uniform and effective.

With these three lines were "scanned" both the local tools of urban planning and national legislation (this way take place the translation of documentation (macro) in the meso level. The background research is represented by the theories and practices of urban development, as well as by analysis of housing policies and concepts related to housing, which have developed in the modern Europe. These theories, even if often utopian, may explain some of the choices of urban development of today or make clear the difference of residential growth trends between the past and present. The garden cities (of tomorrow) of Howard and the working-class neighbourhoods of Bruno Taut, or general issues of inhabiting elaborated by the Modern Movement, which involved the whole of Europe in the early decades of the twentieth century, they are models that have guided the construction of residential neighbourhoods along the twentieth century. The application of the lecorbusian "high ideals" through the use of prefabrication after the Second World War is a very interesting aspect of the development of housing policies, which aimed above all to economization and speed in the implementation of operations under the pressure of migration and economic recovery after the war. It was essential also for research to analyze the social changes of life style, which have crossing Europe from XX century; starting from the Engels’s housing question and the opposing concepts of community and society elaborated by Ferdinand Tönnies in 1887, ending with reflections on the “corrosion of character” of the flexible man of Richard Sennett and with the importance of the community of Zygmunt Bauman (2001).

40|$|Triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) is a high-yielding and {{vigourous}} {{interspecific hybrid}} between wheat and cereal rye. The crop {{is known for}} tolerance of abiotic stresses and high biomass production, and thus {{it has the potential}} to increase the profitability and productivity of growers in marginal environments and to help address the food production challenges of the 21 st century. The original cultivars from the 1960 s and 1970 s usually produced grain with flour properties in between triticale’s progenitor species, and thus produced dough inferior to wheat and unsuitable for a range of food products, including loaf bread, flat bread, cakes, biscuits and crackers. However over the last 40 years, grain yield and grain quality for animal feed have been significantly improved through breeding and selection, and hence indirect improvements (or at the least, genetic drift in quality alleles) in its potential to produce good food products could be expected. Furthermore, significant advances in wheat quality research have produced vast amounts of information, methodology and technology that can be easily used to improve triticale quality, and the tastes of the modern consumer are different to those of 40 years ago. This thesis aimed to characterise the flour properties of a range of modern triticale cultivars and compare them to wheat, then investigate genetic, agronomic and post-harvest strategies to improve the value of the grain for a human food market. Focus was given to the two major scientific issues which have historically hindered the use of triticale flour in food products – poor gluten strength and high α-amylase activity – and to other quality traits of commercial significance. The grain and flour quality was quantified in up to 17 modern triticale cultivars grown in four environments over 2 years – Greendale, NSW in 2009 (JP 09), Cowra, NSW in 2010 (COW 10), both of which are typical triticale growing environments with poor soil and minimal fertiliser, Narrabri, NSW in 2010 (NARR 10), which is a high yielding, high quality environment known for producing Australian Prime Hard wheat, and Stirling, SA in 2011 (SA 11) which is a high protein, low yielding environment. Field plots were arranged in a randomised complete block design at JP 09, COW 10 and NARR 10 with minimal irrigation; rust was controlled with fungicide. The three varieties from SA 11 were sourced from commercial seed production lots. Grain was milled to wholemeal flour on a Newport Scientific hammer mill with 0. 5 mm screen, and to white flour on both a Quadrumat® Junior Mill and a Bühler experimental mill. Glutenin and secalin subunits were characterised by SDS-PAGE and the gluten properties were investigated using the SDS-sedimentation test and mixographs. α-Amylase activity was investigated spectrophotometrically and using the falling number test. These vi measurements were compared to estimations of grain protein, non-starch polysaccharides (NSP), starch content and fibre content using near-infrared transmittance (NIT). Flour protein was estimated by NIR (near-infrared reflectance). The pasting properties of milled flours were evaluated on a Newport Scientific Rapid Visco Analyzer according to AACC 76 - 21, except 10 mM AgNO 3 was used in place of DI water to inhibit α-amylase activity. Grain hardness was measured by the Single-Kernel Characterisation System and moisture and ash content by standard oven methods. Colour of Junior milled flour was assessed using a Minolta Chroma meter CR- 400. Finally, plain cookies were baked according to a standard recipe used to assess soft wheats. Variability in the glutenin and secalin subunits was small relative to global diversity amongst triticale cultivars, and reflects the narrow genetic base of material in Australian breeding programs. The gluten quality of these triticale cultivars was inferior to bread wheat but similar to soft wheat; however the protein content of triticale flour was significantly lower than wheat flour. Lower triticale protein content represents a change from early cultivars and reduces its capacity to form viscoelastic gluten. Cultivars Hawkeye and Vicuna were recommended for breeding to improve gluten strength in locally adapted germplasm. Much greater variability in starch and NSP characteristics were found in triticale compared to wheat, and the ranges overlapped between species. The cultivars Tobruk, Yukuri and Berkshire expressed equivalent α-amylase activity to wheat; cultivars Jaywick and Yukuri were found to have partially waxy starch. Triticale generally exhibited higher NSP, equivalent pasting properties, higher α-amylase activity and lower falling number than wheat checks. However, low falling number was not indicative of high α-amylase activity; this contradicts the assumptions on which previous triticale research was based and has implications for the interpretation of research and the use of falling number to compare triticale to wheat. Furthermore, an unexpected negative correlation was observed with NSP, where higher NSP reduced the slurry viscosity measured in the falling number test. Modification of the falling number test is recommended before it can be used in triticale breeding programs. Nevertheless, the observed genetic variability in starch characteristics and α-amylase activity indicates some triticale cultivars have waxy properties conducive to the production of noodles, and that certain lines exhibited similar late-maturity α-amylase activity to modern wheat cultivars: an indirect benefit of breeding and selection over the past few decades. Like starch properties, great variation was found amongst triticale cultivars for hardness, colour and milling yield. Berkshire displayed a grain hardness equivalent to durum wheat, suggesting a null allele at the rye softness protein locus (Sin locus); the remaining cultivars exhibited a grain hardness between soft wheat and bread wheat. The high milling yield and low fibre content of Tobruk (milling yield was even higher than bread wheat) suggested this line has a thin seed coat and thus would be an excellent parent for the genetic improvement of triticale milling yield. Average flour ash content was significantly higher vii than wheat in both statistical and practical terms, and a different bench mark needs to be used for low ash triticale flour compared to low ash wheat. Apart from Vicuna and Yukuri, triticale cultivars produced darker flour than wheat, however with modern consumer preferences tending towards ‘healthy-looking’ foods, darker flour should not be a hindrance to its utility. The overall results confirmed previous suggestions that triticale is suited to soft wheat products such as cookies, and hence their cookie quality was investigated. Although the dough behaviour and water absorption of triticale was different to soft wheat (specifically, triticale dough tended to loose large amounts of water during sheeting), triticale cookies were found to be equivalent to soft wheat cookies. Overall, the survey of quality amongst modern triticale cultivars suggested two things: firstly, sufficient genetic variation exists amongst current lines to breed triticale cultivars with significantly improved flour quality (comparable to wheat for some quality traits); secondly, there is a clear need to classify current cultivars into suitability for various end uses. This would facilitate efficient marketing to the milling industry and subsequent use in food products. Improvement of the the poor gluten strength in triticale was attempted by backcrossing locally-adapted spring breeding lines to DH 265, a winter line which contained a modified 1 R chromosome carrying two translocations from 1 D of bread wheat – the Glu-D 1 d allele from 1 DL (which simultaneously removed Glu-R 1) and the Gli-D 1 /Glu-D 3 locus from the distal end of 1 DS. Single plant and plot selection was performed on five cross populations grown in multiple environments and the yield, protein content and gluten strength was analysed on F 4 -derived F 7 grain. Lines containing the translocation had a slightly lower yield compared to the null lines and the triticale checks; but similar to the wheat checks for all except one cross (which was significantly less). This may reflect a loss of root system vigour, head length or higher selection pressure due to lower transmission rate of the translocation to offspring. The translocation slightly increased protein content in two populations and increased SDS-sedimentation height in one population (after accounting for the influence of higher protein content). However, no difference was detected between the overall average SDS-sedimentation height of the null lines and the wheat and triticale checks. This is partially due to large variability in SDS-sedimentation height within each cross population resulting from significant variability at other glutenin and secalin loci. Nevertheless, several lines were identified with grain yield equivalent to current triticale cultivars (and significantly higher than wheat) plus equivalent SDS-sedimentation height to wheat. Thus the translocation is a potential solution to the generally poor gluten strength of modern triticale cultivars. The viability of using existing variability for secaloglutenin alleles in the progenitor species was investigated as a means of creating new germplasm (‘primary triticales’) with high gluten strength. The HMW glutenins of five durum lines, and the HMW secalins and 75 k γ- secalins of two rye lines, were defined using SDS-PAGE. These lines were then crossed, new primaries were produced, and grain was tested for the expression of secaloglutenin viii alleles, protein content and SDS-sedimentation height as an estimation of secalogluten strength. The secaloglutenin alleles were simply inherited from the parental plants and all were expressed normally in the offspring, however it was possible that mixed oligomers were formed between glutenins and secalins at the macromolecular level. Significant differences were observed in the SDS-sedimentation height of primaries originating from different durum parents, suggesting that selection of durum parents with high SDSsedimentation is a viable method for producing triticale flour with superior gluten properties. In south-eastern Australia, dual-purpose cropping is commonly used by growers to manage risk in <b>mixed</b> <b>enterprise</b> operations. A preliminary report of lower ash content but comparable protein content in triticale produced in dual-purpose systems was reported in Bangladesh and hence an experiment was conducted to assess the effect of biomass removal on grain yield, test weight, protein content and ash content of grain from four Australian dual-purpose triticale lines grown in five year-site environments (ash content is correlated with nutritional value, milling yield and flour colour). Ash content was either unaffected or increased by removal of biomass and both protein content and grain yield were reduced. It was concluded that although ash content was lower in some lines cut late in the season, the general effect was detrimental to quality and even when ash content was reduced, the effect was not large enough to reduce the level to that of wheat. Hence similar to wheat, dual-purpose triticale systems are not recommended for production of grain for a milling market. Poor milling yield in triticale is a key concern for millers. However, the high variability of grain hardness in triticale, historic problems with grain shrivelling, and lack of varietal classification has meant milling is usually conducted without adjusting settings to batch characteristics. Hence the importance of tempering moisture was investigated in three triticale varieties of varying hardness grown in two environments alongside a wheat standard. Milling yield and ash content both increased as tempering moisture was decreased from 15...|$|E

Regression analysis reveals that a “model of exchange” is the predominant pattern as opposed to “state capture” (in the case of big firms) or “grabbing hand” (in the case of SMEs), both of which were typical of the 1990 s. However, there are some differences in priorities at different levels of government. The federal government in 2007 - 2008 provided more support to state-owned and <b>mixed</b> <b>enterprises</b> providing stable employment, while regional authorities more often supported firms that were pursuing modernization.

By 1850 the Ruhr had 50 iron works with 2,813 full-time employees. The first modern furnace was built in 1849. The creation of the German Empire in 1870 gave further impetus to rapid growth, as Germany started to catch up with Britain. From 1880 to World War I, the industry of the Ruhr area consisted of numerous enterprises, each working on a separate level of production. <b>Mixed</b> <b>enterprises</b> could unite all levels of production through vertical integration, thus lowering production costs.

Taking into account the low quality of market institutions in the 1990 s (i. e., the market failure phenomenon), we assume that state intervention as the “second best ” institution had a positive impact in this case. Using a dataset of 822 joint-stock companies, we tested this hypothesis in two types of corporate models – state-owned or mixed firms and “politically connected ” firms. The first model confirmed a strong positive influence of state ownership on the corporate governance in Russia in 2001 - 2004. The estimation results of this model are statistically robust in different specifications. We connect this result with attempts of the Russian government to use standard mechanisms and procedures of corporate governance to defend its property rights in its relations with state-owned and <b>mixed</b> <b>enterprises...</b>|$|R

We assess the potential for <b>enterprise</b> <b>mix</b> diversification in mitigating climate induced variability in long term net returns from rain-fed agriculture. We build on APSIM modelling and apply Monte Carlo simulation, probability theory, and finance techniques, to assess the potential for <b>enterprise</b> <b>mix</b> diversification to mitigate climate-induced variability in long term economic returns from rain-fed agriculture. We consider four alternative farm enterprise types consisting of three non-diversified farm enterprises and one diversified farm enterprise consisting of a correlated mix of rain-fed agricultural activities. We analyse a decision to switch from a non-diversified agricultural enterprise with the highest expected return to a diversified agricultural enterprise consisting of a <b>mix</b> of agricultural <b>enterprises.</b> Correlation analysis showed that yields were not perfectly correlated (i. e. are less than 1) indicating that changes in climate variables cause non-proportional impacts on yield production. We conclude that at best, diversification can reduce the standard deviation of net returns by up to about A$ 110 Ha- 1, or 52 % of mean net returns; increase the probability of below-average net returns by up to about 4 % and increase the mean of 10 % of worst probable annual net returns by up to A$ 54 /ha.
