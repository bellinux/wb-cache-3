40|$|Most {{regions of}} the tropics are poorly sampled by {{conventional}} meteorological measurements. Thus, direct inferences of the mesoscale climatology of many tropical locations is difficult, especially those in mountainous areas. Similarly, explaining the atmospheric dynamics associated with the observed <b>mesoclimatology</b> is likewise not simple. One such region with a poorly understood <b>mesoclimatology</b> is the altiplano region of South America. This region includes two very large features that affect the mesoclimatology: Lake Titicaca (~ 140 km long) and a similarly large dry lake or salt flat, the Salar de Uyuni. An enhanced upper-air network, involving mostly pilot balloon stations, was established near and over the Altiplano of Peru and Bolivia {{as part of the}} South American Low Level Jet Experiment (SALLJEX) held during the rainy season of 2002 - 2003. In addition, a network of about 200 simple raingauges was installed across the Peruvian Altiplano. The motivation for these activities was to investigate the relationship between rainfall, synoptic-scale circulations and local topographic effects. The region is characterized by complex terrain and the rainfall shows large spatial gradients and a strong diurnal cycle. This talk will describe the observing networks and the analysis of the raingaug...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{numerical}} weather prediction (NWP) and satellite meteorology on operational weather forecasting has become overwhelming {{in the past few}} years. The paper looks toward the merger of these technologies in making short range 6 - 18 h forecasts through the use of mesoscale NWP models. A short-range (2 - 18 h) mesoscale forecast system envisioned for the near future is described that includes four components: hydrodynamic numerical models, large-scale and mesoscale; satellites, polar orbiting for high latitudes and geostationary for low latitudes; <b>mesoclimatology,</b> derived in large part from satellite data; and special-purpose simple models and empirical relations. It is important that the components of the forecast system be developed in parallel rather than in series if the system is to be completed within five years. There is enough evidence to substantiate the revolution in the mesoscale weather prediction in the next five years...|$|E
