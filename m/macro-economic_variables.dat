The European Union Council on Tourism and Trade (EUCTT) has also awarded the nation as being [...] "The Best Tourist Destination for 2012". Local hotels {{have already begun to}} make plans to facilitate an influx of European tourists upon the nation receiving this designation. However, the EUCTT is not affiliated with any part of the European Union's Institutions. Despite concerns over the global economy, international tourism demand continues to show resilience. The number of international tourists worldwide grew by 5% (22 million) between January and June 2012, with Asia and the Pacific (+8%) leading the growth among the regions. Given this growth rate a total of one billion international tourists are expected by the end of 2012. In 2011, the total contribution of World Travel & Tourism to global GDP was USD6,346.1Bn (9.1% of GDP). In 2011, the Caribbean region received 20.9 million tourists, a growth of 4.4% over the same period in 2010. The Caribbean is the most dependent region on tourism with Travel and Tourism contributing 13.9% (USD47.1Bn) to its economic output. Trinidad and Tobago received an estimated 402,058 visitors in 2011, representing 2% of all Caribbean visitor arrivals. Due to the multifaceted nature of tourism, its economic impact is not confined to any single industry. To adequately measure the economic impact of the tourism sector, the United Nations World Travel and Tourism Council (UNWTO) devised the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA), an extension of the System of National Accounts (SNA). The TSA is a detailed production account of the tourism sector showing its linkages to major industries, total employment, capital formation and additional <b>macro-economic</b> <b>variables.</b>|$|E

40|$|Inflation is {{the most}} {{important}} <b>macro-economic</b> <b>variable</b> mainly used for economic management. There is a widespread agreement that high and volatile inflation can be damaging both to individual businesses and to consumers and hence, to the economy as a whole. When inflation is highly fluctuating and unable to correctly predict, individuals do not tend to invest money for various projects. The objective of this study is therefore to find out the effect of economic variables Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Exchange Rate (USD), Rice Price (RCP) and Treasury bill rate (INTRST) on CCPI using quarterly data on each variable for the period 1979 - 2005 in Sri Lanka. The Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) is used as a proxy variable for inflation. Unit root test confirmed that neither series are stationary in its levels nor first difference of all the series. Therefore Vector Error Correction methodology was carried out to find a suitable model for inflation (CCPI) and identified that series of GDP, USD and RCP granger cause CCPI but INTRST does not do so. The final model developed is: () () () () () () () () () According to the above model lag 2 of CCPI, lag 2 of GDP, lag 1 and 3 of RCP show a positive correlation with CCPI while lag 3 of CCPI and GDP and lag 2 of RCP show a negative correlation with CCPI. It is therefore confirmed that GDP and RCP are the significant factors for inflation in Sri Lanka, and USD and INTRST have no significant effect on inflation. By using the selected model CCPI values are forecasted and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of the fittede model was found less than 5 %. Therefore above model is recommended as the suitable model for forecast CCPI...|$|R

40|$|This article reconsiders {{the role}} of money in three {{dimensions}} of monetary policy: an empirical dimension concerning the link between money and <b>macro-economic</b> target <b>variables,</b> a theoretical dimension concerning {{the role of}} monetary aggregates in models of monetary policy, and a strategic dimension, concerning the use of monetary aggregate {{in the design and}} communication of monetary policy strategies. We review recent research and present empirical evidence for the euro area and other countries. We show that money growth is a reliable indicator of euro-area inflation in the medium and long run. In contrast, the usefulness of money to predict short-run inflation is small in times when inflation and money growth are both low and relatively stable. We show that, although the presentation of models of monetary macro-economics has changed, the role of money is still the same within these models. The strategic role of money changes over time: money moves to the foreground, when inflation is too high, and it stays in the background when inflation is low. Since there is little reason to believe that inflation will always be low in the euro area, we expect that money will regain importance in the ECB's monetary policy strategy sooner or later.

Poor bank profitability, proxied by a low net interest margin, and low GDP growth are found significant in increasing the probability of bank failure. Other useful indicators, for some model specifications, are the share of nonperforming loans and that of non productive assets to banks’ own funds, which raise the likelihood of crisis. A large amount of bank liquid assets, in turn, reduces the likelihood of failure for some model specifications. The opposite is true for high real deposit rates. Although it could be interpreted, at first sight, as a too restrictive monetary policy, this is {{not supported by the}} lack of significance of the real lending rate and, even more so, real money growth, a more direct indicator of the monetary policy stance.

Using Fixed Effects Panel Data Regression, the study finds that: levels of income, and unemployment rates have a significant negative impact on non-life insurance demand; whilst population growth rates, and the level of private sector credit (to GDP) positively impacted non-life insurance demand. Urbanisation rates, and levels of merchandise trade had statistically insignificant effects on non-life insurance demand. Since these variables only explained about 11 % of the variation in the dependent variable, the study suggests that further research into the cultural and institutional (ie.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that the shocks driving many key <b>macro-economic</b> and financial <b>variables</b> display time-varying volatility. In this paper we consider estimation and hypothesis testing on the coefficients of the co-integrating relations and the adjustment coefficients in vector autoregressions driven by both conditional and unconditional heteroskedasticity of a quite general and unknown form in the shocks. We show that the conventional results in Johansen (1996) for the maximum likelihood estimators and associated likelihood ratio tests derived under homoskedasticity do not in general hold {{in the presence of}} heteroskedasticity. As a consequence, standard confidence intervals and tests of hypothesis on these coefficients are potentially unreliable. Solutions to this inference problem based on Wald tests (using a "sandwich" estimator of the variance matrix) and {{on the use of the}} wild bootstrap are discussed. These do not require the practitioner to specify a parametric model for volatility, or to assume that the pattern of volatility is common to, or independent across, the vector of series under analysis. We formally establish the conditions under which these methods are asymptotically valid. A Monte Carlo simulation study demonstrates that significant improvements in finite sample size can be obtained by the bootstrap over the corresponding asymptotic tests in both heteroskedastic and homoskedastic environments.

40|$|Poverty {{alleviation}} is {{an important}} policy objective in developed welfare states. This paper analyzes the effect of social transfer policies on poverty. A vast literature claims that high social effort goes along with low poverty levels across countries. This paper systematically analyzes this claim. We employ several social expenditure ratios (as a proxy for social effort) and correct {{for the impact of}} the tax system and for private social arrangements, using OECD methodology. Also, we control for demographic and macro-economic differences across countries. We performed several tests with the most recent data (LIS, OECD, and SOCX) for the period 1985 - 2005. Our results are less clear-cut than earlier findings. We still find quite a strong negative relationship between the level of public social expenditure and poverty among 28 OECD countries. However, for non-EU 15 countries this relationship is stronger than for the EU 15. The results alter considerably if private social expenditures are included as well. For non-EU 15 countries in our sample, we do not find evidence for a negative correlation between the level of total social spending and the incidence of poverty. In contrast, for the group of EU 15 countries private social arrangements do matter as far as poverty alleviation is concerned. Demographic and <b>macro-economic</b> (control) <b>variables</b> are important as well. We developed and employed multiple linear regression models to control for these complex interrelationships. Our results point at one direction: gross social spending is the driving force as far as differences in poverty levels across countries are concerned, although the ageing of the population and unemployment rates have some explanatory power, both for non-EU 15 countries and for EU 15 countries. Our analyses captures another effect as well. It is essential to control for the impact of taxes on the social expenditure ratios used. By doing so, the linkage between social effort and poverty levels across countries becomes insignificant. In {{view of the fact that}} with these corrections on expenditure statistics, we have a much better – although still not perfect - measure of what governments really devote to social spending, the familiar claim that higher social expenditure goes along with lower poverty levels does not hold across the 28 examined countries examined. We believe that our comparison of the impact of several social expenditure ratios on poverty levels has emphasized that taking into account both the public/private-mix and the impact of the tax system on social expenditure ratios really matters for comparative welfare state research and for policy makers who want to reduce poverty. ...|$|R

A small turbulence in these economies {{would leave the}} economies go in deep troubles. Second great depression which was termed as the global financial crisis 2008 was felt in the mid of September 2008, whose effects were critically evaluated by the economists. The growth in various sectors dwindled, causing huge losses to businesses in trillions of dollars which were responsible due to the fall in stock market prices. Interventions adopted by the apex institutions like central banks and resident governments to withhold such shocks were undertaken to lessen and control them through instrumental object like monetary policy which play a very significant role. The present paper focuses on the economic trends of three countries depending upon the categorization of their developments, i. e., advanced economy, emerging economy and low income economy. The study includes United States, China and Tanzania (Sub-Saharan Africa). The analyses of various <b>macro-economic</b> indicators (<b>variables</b> for the study) of these countries are considered to estimate the factors which influence the growth (GDP) of these economies. The correlation analysis and t- test statistics forms {{a major part of}} the study. The hypothesis statements for the variables are considered to study the interrelationship between the GDP as a constant variable in comparison to the other variables. The main findings of the study reveal that the advanced economies are highly influenced by the foreign exchange reserves and current account balance as their main factor for the growth i. e., Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Emerging economy like China has been influenced by FDI, which plays a vital role thereby increasing the country’s overall reserves as the main factor for growth. Tanzania as the low-income country in past few years observed potential growth in external debt, FDI and reserves, showing a negative current account balance, since the country has very less impact of global financial crisis 2008 over its growth. The impact of monetary policies of Federal reserve on financial crisis were stimulative which lowered the federal fund rates (zero lower bound), which was stable for a longer time.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{endogenous}} determination of financial and trade openness. We outline a framework where financial openness is endogenously {{determined by the}} authority’s choice of financial repression as a taxation device, and where the private sector determines endogenously the magnitude of capital flight. The optimal financial repression is shown {{to depend on the}} openness of the economy to international trade, the efficiency of the tax system (which in turn may be affected by political economy considerations). Similar predictions are obtained in a model where authorities pursue an opportunistic policy representing the interest of a narrow pressure group that engages in capital flight due to political uncertainty. Both models predict that larger trade openness would induce greater financial openness. The reverse association [...] larger financial openness implies greater trade openness [...] may hold due to different channels that are briefly discussed. Hence, we expect to find two-way positive linkages between financial and commercial openness. We confirm these predictions empirically. Having established (Granger) causality, we investigate the relative magnitudes of these directions of causality using the decomposition test developed in Geweke (1982). We find that almost all of the linear feedback between trade and financial openness can be accounted for by G-causality from financial openness to trade openness (53 %) and from trade to financial openness (34 %). The residual is due to simultaneous correlation between the two measures. In our estimations for the determinants of financial openness, we focus on developing countries and examine a host of <b>macro-economic</b> and political-institutional <b>variables</b> as suggested in our theory. We find that a one standard deviation increase in commercial openness is associated with a 9. 5 percent increase in de-facto financial openness (% of GDP), a one standard deviation increase in a democratization index reduces financial openness by 3. 5 %, and a one standard deviation increase in corruption is associated with a 3 % reduction of financial openness. Similar negative dependence applies for measures of political competition. The impact of a budget surplus on financial openness is negative for developing countries, but positive for the OECD. Both the theoretical and empirical analyses lead us to the conclude, counter-intuitively, that a more openly competitive, free and inclusive political system will lead to lower levels of de-facto financial openness.

Country beta is allowed to vary as a function of several <b>macro-economic</b> <b>variables,</b> including the net government overseas borrowing, 90 -day bill rate, ten-year bill rate, wool price, trade-weighted index, manufacturers’ price index, retail trade, current account balance, and money supply. Design/methodology/approach – Multivariate regression analysis is used to test the relation between country volatility and the <b>macro-economic</b> <b>variables</b> for the period September 1985 to March 2000. Findings – It is found that the US dollar exchange rate (USD) and the monetary conditions index (MCI) have a significant impact on New Zealand's country beta. The temporal variance of New Zealand's country beta displayed a great deal of volatility prior to and immediately following the 1987 stock market crash. The beta was far less volatile during the 1990 s. Research limitations/implications – The variable set is restricted by the availability of data concerning the key macro-economic statistics. Practical implications – Risk at the country level is of increasing importance in the evaluation of offshore investments. Practical implications relate to the evaluation of investments in foreign markets, specifically the appropriate cost of capital, given increased integration of financial markets. Originality/value – The study provides a better appreciation of the relationship between the country beta and several <b>macro-economic</b> <b>variables</b> that has not been applied to the New Zealand economy before...|$|E

Here we propose a model suitable for the analysis of multi-variate financial time series data in which the variation in data is explained by latent subspace factors and contributions from a set of observed <b>macro-economic</b> <b>variables.</b> The <b>macro-economic</b> <b>variables</b> being external inputs, the model is termed XNMF (eXogenous inputs NMF). We derive a multiplicative update algorithm to learn the factorization, empirically demonstrate that it converges to useful solutions on real data and prove that it is theoretically guaranteed to monotonically reduce the objective function. On share prices from the FTSE 100 index time series, we show that the proposed model is effective in clustering stocks in similar trading sectors together via the latent representations learned...|$|E

We focus on both the decision to move as well as home location selection. We reconfirm the importance of several socio-demographic and <b>macro-economic</b> <b>variables</b> in these decisions as well as identify several other important variables {{that are relevant to}} these decision processes. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|E
40|$|The Economic Cycle Theory, {{having been}} a somehow {{abandoned}} during several decades, returns to get important with the recent World Financial Crisis 2007 - 2010. This book, based upon a theses sustained in 2007, advances and argues {{the possibility of an}} almost unavoidable world cyclic plunge of <b>macro-economic</b> <b>variables.</b> This includes several political economy recommendations in both national and international scope. Cycle theory, Business Cycle, Kondratieff, economic crisis, political crisis...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{determinants}} of youth unemployment It uses the panel data regression analysis of EU countries. The work assembled models with the dependent variable the unemployment rate and the model is estimated for each demographic group. The models are represented by institutional variables, the <b>macro-economic</b> <b>variables,</b> demographic variables and variables representing education. The goal is to prove or disprove the hypothesis that individual determinants affect differently to the youth unemployment rate and unemployment rate of main age group. Partial task is {{to answer the question}} whether more significant determinants of unemployment rate are institutional or macro-economic determinants. The result of the analysis work is that institutional factors are not important determinants of unemployment rate. Conversely, <b>macro-economic</b> <b>variables,</b> GDP growth and inflation are significant determinants. Significant determinants are also variables representing education. The estimated coefficients of these significant determinants and variables employment labor protection and the tax rate are higher for young people than for the main age group. However, there was not found determinant that would be robustly more significant for youth than for main age group...|$|E
