The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom disapproved of certain pronouncements by the lower courts which appeared to signal {{a return to the}} pre-Anisminic position. According to Lord Dyson, this was not justified as [...] "the importance of Anisminic is that it showed that a <b>material</b> <b>error</b> of law renders a decision a 'nullity' so that the decision is in principle judicially reviewable". He went on to state that [...] "as a matter of principle, there is no justification for drawing the line at jurisdictional error". In his opinion, any restrictions on judicial review require justification and, prima facie, such review should be available to challenge the legality of decisions of public bodies.|$|E

60|$|With {{regard to}} the matter which I am now {{submitting}} to your consideration, I must say for your Committee of Managers and for myself, that the Report was deliberately made, and does not, as I conceive, contain any very <b>material</b> <b>error,</b> nor any undue or indecent reflection upon any person or persons whatever. It does not accuse the Judges of ignorance or corruption. Whatever it says it does not say calumniously. That kind of language belongs to persons whose eloquence entitles them to a free use of epithets. The Report states that the Judges had given their opinions secretly, contrary to the almost uninterrupted tenor of Parliamentary usage on such occasions. It states that the mode of giving the opinions was unprecedented, and contrary to the privileges of the House of Commons. It states that the Committee did not know upon what rules and principles the Judges had decided upon those cases, as they neither heard their opinions delivered, nor have found them entered upon the Journals of the House of Lords. It is very true that we were and are extremely dissatisfied with those opinions, and the consequent determinations of the Lords; {{and we do not}} think such a mode of proceeding at all justified by the most numerous and the best precedents. None of these sentiments is the Committee, as I conceive, (and I feel as little as any of them,) disposed to retract, or to soften in the smallest degree.|$|E

Whereas the Norman, finding in his own heart an irresistible impulse to action, and perceiving himself to be set, with entirely strong body, brain, and will, {{in the midst of a}} weak and dissolute confusion of all things, takes from the Bible instantly into his conscience every exhortation to Do and to Govern; and becomes, with all his might and understanding, a blunt and rough servant, knecht, or knight of God, liable to much misapprehension, of course, as to the services immediately required of him, but supposing, since the whole make of him, outside and in, is a soldier's, that God meant him for a soldier, and that he is to establish, by main force, the Christian faith and works all over the world so far as he comprehends them; not merely with the Mahometan indignation against spiritual error, but with a sound and honest soul's dislike of <b>material</b> <b>error,</b> and resolution to extinguish that, even if perchance found in the spiritual persons to whom, in their office, he yet rendered total reverence.|$|E

Most {{of these cases}} are heard at the old IAT, at Field House, Breams Buildings, just off Chancery Lane in central London. Some are heard elsewhere. The initial hearing is a first-stage reconsideration, usually called an [...] "error of law hearing" [...] by lawyers and Immigration Judges. The panel of Immigration Judges (usually one legally-qualified Senior Immigration Judge {{and one or two}} lay members) determine whether a <b>material</b> <b>error</b> of law was made in the determination (judgment). If they conclude that no error was made, that {{is the end of the}} matter in front of the AIT. If they conclude that there was a <b>material</b> <b>error</b> of law, they may either reconsider the case in full or in part themselves, or (more usually) order that it be re-heard at a later date. They may set out that all the case be re-considered, or only part of it, depending on the exact circumstances. The second-stage reconsideration may be heard by three Immigration Judges, or by a single Immigration Judge.|$|E

30|$|Several {{factors related}} to screw design and {{fabrication}} can affect the risk of abutment or prosthetic screw loosening in a metal-to-metal screw system; these primarily are related to preload which by itself is affected by multiple factors: torque magnitude, screw head design, thread design, and number and composition of metal [8]. There are some factors that can affect initial torque loss, including tightening torque value, implant system, abutment screw <b>material,</b> <b>errors</b> in casting of metallic alloys, repeated tightening/loosening cycles of the screw, and improper insertion torque. These factors can reduce the frictional fit between the screws and internal threads of the implant, which may lead to screw loosening [9, 10].|$|R

The court also held the quantity for dignified human existence in compliance with section 27 of the constitution was in fact 42 litres per person per day rather than 50 litres per person per day. The SCA declared that the installation of water meters was illegal, but suspended the order for two years to give the city an opportunity to rectify the situation.|$|E
50|$|When {{it comes}} to data {{integrity}} the primary concerns are the integration of data from the legacy systems and then ensuring that data being input into the system for processing has been properly approved and is accompanied by the proper documentation.

The word [...] "mitigate" [...] in this context means the control (or controls) reduces the likelihood of <b>material</b> <b>error</b> presented by the MMR to a [...] "remote" [...] probability.

50|$|A {{notarial}} instrument’s “valid” portions {{are open}} to direct rebuttal, but the “conclusive” portions can, in some jurisdictions, only be rebutted by an action of improbation (Fr inscription de faux, It querela di falso, Germ Fälschungsklage) in which a challenger must bring a collateral attack against the instrument, proving a willful <b>material</b> <b>error</b> by strong, clear, and positively convincing proof, rather than the ordinary preponderance of evidence standard in civil actions. Legally, a successful challenge must overcome the praesumptio iustae causa which attaches to a notarial instrument, the result {{of which is that}} said instrument is presumed to have been made or formed with a iusta causa, that is, sufficient legal consideration (causa). This presumption {{stems from the fact that}} a notary is expected to verify the facts, assertions, or events mentioned in his act, thereby assuming liability for and giving warrant to its contents. A successfully improbated instrument is null and set aside.|$|E
5000|$|When {{there is}} {{occasion}} to procure a dispensation that exceeds {{the powers of}} the ordinary, or when there are special reasons for direct recourse to the Holy See, procedure is by way of supplica (petition) and private rescript. The supplica need not necessarily be drawn up by the petitioner, nor even at his instance; it does not, however, become valid until he accepts it. Although, since the Constitution [...] "Sapienti", all the faithful may have direct recourse to the Roman Congregations, the supplica is usually forwarded through the ordinary (of the person's birthplace or domicile, or since the Decree [...] "Ne temere" [...] the residence of one of the petitioners), who transmits it to the proper Congregation either by letter or through his accredited agent; but if there is question of sacramental secrecy, it is sent directly to the Penitentiaria, or handed to the bishop's agent under a sealed cover for transmission to the Penitentiaria. The supplica ought to give the names (family and Christian) of the petitioners (except in secret cases forwarded to the Penitentiaria), the name of the Ordinary forwarding it, or the name of the priest to whom, in secret cases, the rescript must be sent; the age of the parties, especially in dispensations affecting consanguinity and affinity; their religion, at 1east when one of them is not a Catholic; the nature, degree and number of all impediments (if recourse is had to the Congregatio de Disciplinâ Sacramentorum or to the Holy Office in a public impediment, and to the Penitentiaria {{at the same time in}} a secret one, it is necessary that the latter should know of the public impediment and that recourse has been had to the competent Congregation). The supplica must also contain the causes set forth for granting the dispensation and other circumstances specified in the Propaganda Fide Instruction of 9 May 1877 (it is no longer necessary, either for the validity or liceity of the dispensation, to observe the paragraph relating to incestuous intercourse, even when probably this very thing had been alleged as the only reason for granting the dispensation). When there is question of consanguinity in the second degree bordering on the first, the supplica ought to be written by the bishop's own hand. He ought also to sign the declaration of poverty made by the petitioners when the dispensation is sought from the Penitentiaria in formâ pauperum; when he is in any way hindered from so doing he is bound to commission a priest to sign it in his name. A false declaration of poverty henceforth does not invalidate a dispensation in any case; but the authors of the false statement are bound in conscience to reimburse any amount unduly withheld (regulation for the Roman Curia of 12 June 1908). For further information on the many points already briefly described see the special canonical works, wherein are found all necessary directions as to what must be expressed so as to avoid nullity. When a supplica is affected (in a material point) by obreption or subreption it becomes necessary to ask for a so-called [...] "reformatory decree" [...] in case the favour asked has not yet been granted by the Curia, or for the letters known as [...] "Perinde ac valere" [...] if the favour has already been granted. If after all this a further <b>material</b> <b>error</b> is discovered, letters known as [...] "Perinde ac valere super perinde ac valere" [...] must be applied for.|$|E

In the real time economy, timely and reliable financial information is critical for day-to-day business decisions regarding strategic planning, capital acquisition, credit decisions, supplier partnerships, and so forth. Advances in accounting information systems such as the advent of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have enabled the generation of real time information. However, the practice of traditional auditing has not kept pace with the real time economy. Traditional manual audit procedures are labor and time intensive, which limits audit frequency to a periodic basis, such as annually.|$|R
