25|$|In 1957, William L. Weirich {{published}} {{the results of}} research performed at the University of Minnesota. These studies demonstrated the restoration of heart rate, cardiac output and mean aortic pressures in animal subjects with complete heart block {{through the use of}} a <b>myocardial</b> <b>electrode.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{and persistence}} of complete heart block has constituted {{an important source}} of morbidity and mortality for patients undergoing open heart surgery for repair of congenital septal defects. Intensive efforts to improve the management of this complication have been made by our surgical groupâ€™ 4 and this knowledge has contributed to a significant reduction in mortality. The placement of a <b>myocardial</b> <b>electrode</b> 24 during surgery has proved to be the best method for control of heart block present following operative procedures. Very occasionally, however, complete and persistent heart block has not occurred at the time of surgery but has had a late onset in the days following the opera-tive procedure and at that time reliance had to be placed upon drug (Isoproterenolf U. S. P.) therapy inasmuch as this complication has not occurred frequently enough to make it practical, in our opinion, to insert a myocardial wire prophylactically as a routine procedure. However, it should be mentioned that in selected patients where there has been reason to suspect the likelihood of atrioventricular dissociation occurring again subsequently, we have implanted a <b>myocardial</b> <b>electrode</b> prophylac-tically since no deleterious effects have been recognized experimentally or clinically from the temporary presence of this fine wire in the right ventricular musculature. Moreover, since the <b>myocardial</b> <b>electrode</b> has been so effective in con-trolling the heart rate of surgical patients with complete atrioventricular dissociation, it has seemed logical to consider methods for application o...|$|E
40|$|During {{implantation}} of a pacemaker into a 15 -year-old male (height: 155 cm, weight: 65 kg) {{suffering from}} complete atrioventricular block, {{it was difficult}} to exteriorize the myocardium by approaching from below the xiphoid process so an operative field was obtained by using a heart stabilizer. A <b>myocardial</b> <b>electrode</b> was fixed after confirming stable circulatory dynamics with no arrhythmia and good R wave amplitude and pacing thresholds. As the heart stabilizer is now a vital device for off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB), we consider that it will also become a useful device for procedures other than OPCAB in the field of cardiac surgery...|$|E
40|$|Adams attacks due to {{ventricular}} tachy-cardia and fibrillation {{has been}} a particularly difficult problem. Drugs that depress ventric-ular irritability, such as quinidine, procaine amide, and potassium, are contraindicated in patients with complete atrioventricular block and should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with partial block. 1 - 3 We have previously demonstrated, however, that one way of preventinig such recurrent attacks is to drive the ventricles with an electric pace-maker at rates faster than the idioventricular rate; rates of 60 to 80 per minute are usually suffieient. 3 Electric stimulation may be ap-plied externally for short periods, 4 by an endocardial catheter electrode for longer in-tervals, 5 or indefinitely with an implanted pacemaker and <b>myocardial</b> <b>electrodes.</b> 0 8 Another way to accelerate the ventricular rate is with sympathomimetic drugs. These affents, however, also have a prominent effect of increasing ventricular irritabilitv, so that their use in patients with ventricular tachy-eardia and fibrillation is usually considered to be contraindicated. Administration of these drugs under these circumstances re-(uires meticulous control for the satisfactory resolution of the dilemma presented by these opposing effects. The idea of using such agents to prevent seizures due to tachyeardia or fibrillation is not new: ephedrine, isoproterenol, and epi-nephrine have been used orally, subeutane-ously, and even intravenously. 9 - 11 WVe have found, however, that these drugs are ofte...|$|R
40|$|Bradycardia, with {{or without}} hypotension, {{frequently}} occurs in the early phases of acute myocardial infarction. To determine the relative effects of alterations in heart rate and blood pressure {{on the degree of}} ischemic injury, the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 15 -min periods in closed-chest conscious dogs by in-flating a balloon cuff previously implanted around the artery. The degree of myocardial ischemia was estimated by summating the S-T elevation recorded from 12 <b>myocardial</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Heart rate was increased by atropine or pacing and decreased by electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve. Hypotension was produced by venesection (average decrease in mean BP, 56 mm Hg). At normal arterial pressures there was a positive correlation between percent change in heart rate (range 30 - 215 beats/min) and per-cent change in S-T elevation (y = 0. 75 X + 30. 2, r = 0. 93, P < 0. 01). When myocardial ischemia was induced during hypotension and bradycardia, S-T elevation totaled 68 mv at 15 min of ischemia. When heart rate was increased to control levels in the presence of hypotension S-T elevation during myocardial ischemia was greater (mean difference 29 mv, P < 0. 05). In contrast, when blood pressure was increased to control in the presence of bradycardia, S-T elevation in seven of 10 dogs was less than during hypo-tension and bradyeardia. Thus, during experimental acute myocardial ischemia, hypo-tension induced by hemorrhage increases ischemic injury, and bradycardia reduces it. It is concluded that in acute myocardial ischemia increases in heart rate, even from slow baseline rates; may be deleterious to the myocardium. It remains to be determined whether alterations in the degree of myocardial ischemia induced by hemorrhagic-hypotension are analogous to those caused by the type of hypotension that often ac-companies bradycardia occurring during acute myocardial infarction in man...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY As {{pacemaker}} <b>electrode</b> <b>myocardial</b> {{contact area}} is reduced, the energy required {{to stimulate the}} heart decreases; but the effect of surface area on an electrode's ability to transmit R-wave potentials has not been well documented. Endocardial and intramyo-cardial R-wave potentials were measured in ten dogs with seven com-mercially available pacemaker electrodes of different surface area. With a load impedance of 1000 ohms, there was a direct correlation between surface area and the R-wave potentials measured. The WHEN USED with ventricular programmed (ventricular inhibited or triggered) pacemakers, cardiac pacemaker leads serve two equally critical functions. They transmit an elec-trical stimulus from the power source (pacemaker) to the heart in order to initiate muscle contraction, and they transmit ventricular depolarization impulses from the heart to the pacemaker. Research, to date, has been primaril...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY A 3 -year {{study by}} three medical centers has {{revealed}} a 1 -year electrode malfunction rate of 7. 4 %; most malfunctions occurred {{within the first}} 30 days. The incidence of unavoidable early malfunction (3. 2 %) fell within the 5 % standards suggested by the committee report of the Inter-Society Committee on Heart Diseases. Incidences of obscure cause (3. 2 %) {{may be difficult to}} identify prospectively and may be, to a certain extent, unavoidable. The majority of the malfunctions (4. 2 %) showed specific clues that indicated that they were preventable. Successful repositioning was achieved on the first attempt in 80. 6 % of the cases with malfunction, and only 0. 7 % required ultimate <b>myocardial</b> <b>electrode</b> implantation. The principal clues to potentially un-satisfactory positioning included the presence of a large right ventricle with or without tricuspid insufficiency, current thresholds greater than 0. 5 mA and ST-segment deviations on the intracardiac electrogram of less than 2 mV. Electrode malfunction may be more common with bipolar than with unipolar electrodes; but significant differences in the incidence of malfunction among different unipolar electrodes were observed. These data in-dicate that further developments in transvenous electrode design are warranted. PERMANENT transvenous right ventricular apica...|$|E
