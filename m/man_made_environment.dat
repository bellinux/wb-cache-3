Consequently, a large volume of multitemporal data is available, which contains information appropriate {{for a number of}} applications, such as temporal change detection, coastline or urban development monitoring, deforestation, etc. For the good use of these data several point-based or feature-based registration techniques have been developed.

Through a combination of collage and print techniques images of a rugged and unmodified landscape were created. When presented as a series these images represent the changes which continually affect a seemingly static landscape. Not the simple obvious changes man may make, such as construction or buildings or dams, but the changes caused by the time of day, time of year or by the weather. Changes which do not rapidly alter the placement of objects, but which thoroughly and continually challenge awareness of one's self and one's surroundings. This is quite different from an urban life where air is conditioned, soft music masks street noises, doors open automatically, and walls confine vision. A <b>man</b> <b>made</b> <b>environment</b> allows exploration of some fields in great depth, but like interbreeding much is lost and weaknesses develop. It is commonly believed that man can create infinitely complex objects, however, man must understand what he wishes to make, how to make it, and having once made it, how to use it, in order to make something. Men made things are understood, and things that are understood can be made. Therefore, man made things can be duplicated. A television set or space ship, or even the communications network allowing relatively safe space travel, even if totally destroyed, can be reconstructed. Whereas, if a honey bee is smashed, all mankind cannot make a new honey bee, only more bees have that ability.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of art is convey an {{appropriate}} message to the preceiver through the expression of feelings. Therefore architecture which is its sublime from fulfilling there requirements becomes an art. As an art, architecture provides the back-drop to convey the appropriate message to create meaningful spaces which are identified as architectural spaces. Every living organism requires space for its existence. Therefore the framework provided for their existence is considered as the dimensions of living things. Space can be limited or unlimited. Limitless space around us is considered as infant space. When the space is bounded by natural or man made limitations it becomes realistic. Space could be considered as the major force, evoking or conditioning the human mind. It provides not only the participant or the user with adequate physical movement but also create emotional satisfaction. The emotional satisfaction of the percevior could be achieved through the meaningful articulate inside the space. It helps the observer in preconceiving spaces in their true perspective. That means it communicate the appropriate message to the participant thus creating the derived environmental quality within the particular space. Therefore architecture mainly consider with qualitative needs while filling the quantitative needs. The environmental quality in architectural space is determined by several factors. That is form, scale, proportion, interrelation of spaces, objects inside, and the way how these factors blend with each other. Quality of an architectural space is also affected due to expression of visual surfaces of enclosure planes and objects and their interrelationship to each other. Most effective visual property of the surface is its color, its light and its texture. However the way people perceive or respond to the environment emotionally or spatially depend on their physiological nature, personalities, their cultural and social backgrounds and the environment itself. Color {{can be regarded as}} one of the visual properties of surfaces and also can be experienced through the sense of vision. It is also known as the character of the surface or enclosure planes within a space character of form. Various colors can be achieved in different ways such as the way that materials are manipulated using color pigments on a surface. Color can be identified both in nature as well as in <b>man</b> <b>made</b> <b>environment.</b> Color in nature play a dominant role in creating well balanced, non disturbing and effective environment. Flowers, plants, fruits, plumage of birds, the gaudy fish, sunset, blue sky are the most striking colors of nature. Color also indicate time as much as it changes with time. Altering the day cycle and from one season to the other. Physiology shows that color has an enormous effect on the human emotional responses. Therefore color perception not only does lead to give visual striking but is also deeply involved in evoking variety of human emotions and thereby affecting human behavior. Color as a basic and vital force is lacking in architectural spaces. Now we are speaking about color balance, color harmony, color contract etc. All depend on color value, tone and brightness of the color. Most of us are not making use of its power enough.

Marketing of Science, Commercial and Political marketing, have wanted to simplify this complex world at the most, reaching the limits of binary reduction of black and white, of Opposition and Exclusion. The Communication Mediatory Mask has ceased fulfilling its social function of interpreter, transmitter of truth. It became reducer, letting appearance to be confused with reality, disinformer by fact. Thus, the way to cognitive dissociation and repeated inconsistencies, was fully mapped out. Children of the century, researchers became heavily contaminated, and scientists were accused of inconsistancy. In the food and agri-business field, {{as well as in the}} pharmaceutical field, the sanction has been, is or will be severe (animal flours and new variants of prion disease, coxiBs or anti-Cox 2). The real scientific discourse is actually very consistant, provided no acquisition, no question, neither from past nor for present time, is ignored, provided one’s accepts its complexity. Several ignored questions or problems about to be solved or renewed, are raised :- Tendency to take a part for the whole, the concept of flux speed, of endogenous synthesis speed, concept of the influence of a different <b>man</b> <b>made</b> <b>environment</b> – Excess of exogenous or endogenous oleic acid, danger of cholesterol oleate, but requirement for a little amount of endogenous oleic acid - Phytosterols and 25 -OH vitamin D- Requirement for a saturated fatty acids minimal amount. -Confusion between Vaccenic acid :-C 18  : 1 n- 7 trans, natural parent of Rumenic acid, and Elaidic acid (C 18  : 1 n- 9 trans) product of industrial hydrogenation. Furthermore new and old data on the confusion between alphalinolenic acid (in general) and alpha-linolenic in sn- 2 position, the only one to be indispensable, are emerging together with the consequences of this confusion. It is logical to acknowledge Rapeseed oil as the best source of alpha-linolenic acid in sn- 2 position bioavailable. It is more than questionnable for Soybean oil. The knowledge explosion last quarter of the 20 th century has made the Opposition- Eclusion of the P/S ratio completely obsolete. The 21 st century is opening up with three themes which are as completely different as consistent this time, Competition, Balance, Synergy. Competition can take place between five unsaturated fatty acids families : Palmitoleic, Oleic, Vaccenic n- 7 trans, Linoleic, Alpha-Linolenic, using common enzymatic systems of selective esterification, elongation, desaturation, deacylation-reacylation, and for the upper derivatives of LA and ALA using numerous oxygenases. Competition can also take place intra-family, e. g. The homeostatic Thromboxane (n- 6 family) and Prostacycline (n- 6 family) balance in the cardiovascular field, which thus makes the exclusive interest for the phospholipids LC n- 6, n- 3 (resident drugs) somewhat insufficient. Moreover when LCn- 3 inhibit COX 2 which syntethise Prostacycline, Lauric acid is an inducter. The concept of Balance is fundamental, the low fat /high carbohydrate diet following, the advice of the P/S « vulgate » transforming 36  %of the protective A phenotype into the dangerous B phenotype (small LDLs), doubling the vascular risk. Thus the principle of precaution creates an artificial risk in 36  % of the population to improve 10  % of the same population! The concept of Synergy is the third theme of the 21 st century. It became indispensable with the discovery of cotranscriptionnally myristoylated proteins or peptides which play a major rôle at the phospholipidic membranes. In vitro myristic acid increases delta- 6 desaturase activity, a key step in unsaturated fatty acid métabolism. In vivo in human, the presence in the diet of myristic acid in sn- 2 position, and alpha-linolenic in sn- 2 position, at a precise range, is correlated with a rise of DHA in cholesterol esters and in phospholipids. Similarly LCAT activity is synergistically increased in humans by 153  % by the same combination of alpha-linolenic and myristic acid both at the sn- 2 position. Opposition-exclusion are the marks of the 20 th century. Competition, balance, synergy are the bases of a new era for lipids in the 21 st century...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} robot and landmarks 2 D localization, in <b>man</b> <b>made</b> <b>environments,</b> taking profit of scene planes. The method uses bearing-only measurements that are robustly matched in three views. In our experiments we obtain them from vertical lines corresponding to natural landmarks. With these three view line-matches a trifocal tensor can be computed. This tensor contains the three views geometry and is used to estimate the aforementioned localization. As it is very usual to find a planar surface, we use the homography corresponding to that plane to obtain the tensor with one match less than the general case method. This implies lower computational complexity, mainly when trying a robust estimation, where we see {{a reduction in the}} number of iterations needed. Another advantage of obtaining an homography during the process is that it can help to automatically detect singular situations, such us totally planar scenes. It is shown that our proposal performs similarly to the general case method in a general scenario and better in case that we have some dominant plane in the scene. This paper includes simulated results proving this, as well as examples with real images from conventional and omnidirectional cameras.

Through architecture, we can learn about the civilization that {{involved}} in creating the architectural artifacts. Therefore architecture is a civilization product can be considered as signs with meanings behind it. One of architectural object that is meaningful is the architecture of churches. Church architecture is meaningful because contained not only functional meanings but also religious meanings which had been produced for thousands years by human civilization. W. C. P Schoemaker is a Dutch architect who designed 2 great churches in Bandung – that is Catholic Church : St Peter’s Cathedral and Lutheran Church : Bethel Church – at the same decade. It is interesting that Schoemaker created these 2 churches at about the same period as a synthesis of each denomination’s needs, values and religious concepts but with so many similarities in each design elements. In this paper, the similarities of design elements that is found in both buildings will be collected. This paper also tries to find out whether the elements are the synthesis of basic Christianity or they are a personal characteristic of the architect...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with anthropomorphic landscapes in the 16 th and 17 th century art in western Europe, their origins and legacy. The composition of such works {{is based on the}} idea of double-imaging: they are visual representations of fantastic landscapes depicted in the form of human heads or whole figures, in which trees, rocks, buildings and other elements of the natural and <b>man</b> <b>made</b> <b>environments</b> are used to represent anatomical features. Such images escape classification and make terms traditionally used in the history of art to describe pictorial genres redundant. No earlier monographic study of anthropomorphic landscapes has been located. When considered previously, individual examples of anthropomorphic landscapes were considered as anamorphoses (art of distorted perspective) or composite heads in the style of Giuseppe Arcimboldo, ie grotesque depictions of people whose bodies consisted of various objects. By stressing the 'portraiture' aspect of the composition earlier scholars neglected the landscape. In this study these approaches are re-examined in the light of contemporary visual and textual evidence and a different iconological interpretation is proposed. Within the double-imaging the image of man and the image of Nature are regarded here as equally important and totally interrelated: man is the image of the world. Anthropomorphic landscapes are seen as meaningful cosmological representations of the world. They illustrate the religious, philosophical, scientific and artistic concept of man being 'a little world'. This ancient tenet of natural philosophy has been replaced by modern concepts {{of the world and the}} cosmological meaning of anthropomorphic landscapes has been lost. This research is also concerned with the use of digital technologies in iconographical analysis and interpretetion. The catalogue raisonne of anthropomorphic landscapes has the format of an interactive multimedia application. It also incorporates an anthology of texts on anthropomorphism and a biographical dictionary. The iconographical analysis of the works was greatly aided by image processing, and the use of pattern recognition techniques was investigated as an laternative to traditional classification systems. The implications of digital imaging methods and the role of digital discourse as an interpretive technique for iconographic studies are also considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{meteoroid}} and <b>man</b> <b>made</b> {{space debris}} <b>environments</b> of an Earth orbital manned space operations center are discussed. Protective shielding thickness and design configurations for providing given levels of no penetration probability were also calculated. Meteoroid/debris protection {{consists of a}} radiator/shield thickness, which is actually an outer skin, separated from the pressure wall, thickness by a distance. An ideal shield thickness, will, upon impact with a particle, cause both the particle and shield to vaporize, allowing a minimum amount of debris to impact the pressure wall itself. A shield which is too thick will crater on the outside, and release small particles of shield from the inside causing damage to the pressure wall. Inversely, if the shield is too thin, it will afford no protection, and the backup must provide all necessary protection. It was concluded that a double wall concept is most effective...|$|R
40|$|Three urban {{redevelopment}} projects recently undertaken in Europe-Ria 2000 in Bilbao, Spain; Emscher Park in Germany; and Gasometer in Vienna, Austria, are presented and {{discussed in the}} paper. All three innovate on three independent levels culture, economy and urban organization, and provide high quality places to assist their cities and regions {{to cope with a}} global competitive environment. All three were also designed to represent the best of the sustainable practice in Europe at the time. In the same time, the basic philosophy of all three is deeply rooted in creative economies and elaborate their basis principles. The paper explores their design solution in order to identify the points where creative industries and sustainability meet, and investigates if, and to what extent, they comply with the principles of sustainability. Urban design and physical space are in focus, while other areas are considered as long as they contribute to the design, or reflect a credo that architecture and urban design are among those that {{play a central role in}} building cities' reputation and character. The author argues that all three materialized some of the basic principles of sustainability, by elaborating ideas of genius loci and the relationship between identity and locality. Emscher Park has been the most successful in demonstrating how the Brownfield site and devastated area could be transformed into the cultural landscape. Ria 2000 brought in a new interpretation of balance between the <b>man</b> <b>made</b> and natural <b>environments.</b> Gasometer has been least successful, and rather its solutions go after the traditional redevelopment paradigm...|$|R
