60|$|You <b>may</b> <b>fancy</b> how Esther quailed at {{this new}} feature of the meeting between her two idols.|$|E
60|$|There {{are many}} odd things to put down, and, lest who reads them <b>may</b> <b>fancy</b> that I dined too well before I left Bistritz, {{let me put}} down my dinner exactly.|$|E
60|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. [Rising.] Well, I won't {{keep you}} from her. [Goes with him towards door.] I have told Farquhar to put a brace of {{partridge}} into the carriage. Mrs. Daubeny <b>may</b> <b>fancy</b> them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I fancied, {{from the}} tone of your letters and our conversation--it <b>may</b> be <b>fancy</b> only--that you were somehow losing {{intellectual}} grasp. Hasn't it struck you, Cuthbert?" ...|$|R
60|$|This {{effort of}} Grandfather's <b>fancy</b> <b>may</b> {{be called the}} Tory's Farewell.|$|R
6000|$|... "And what <b>may</b> this <b>fancy</b> of your Lordship be?" [...] said Mrs. Wilson, {{willing to}} gratify the trifling. [...] "What {{kind of a}} woman {{do you mean to}} choose? How tall for instance?" ...|$|R
60|$|Singing {{after dinner}} and supper was the {{universal}} fashion of the day. You <b>may</b> <b>fancy</b> all England sounding with choruses, some ribald, some harmless, but all occasioning {{the consumption of}} a prodigious deal of fermented liquor.|$|E
60|$|But one <b>may</b> <b>fancy,</b> {{for once}} in a way, what William's {{thoughts}} were, when they brought him the evil news of York. For we know what his acts were; and he acted up to his thoughts.|$|E
60|$|I wheeled {{suddenly}} as you <b>may</b> <b>fancy,</b> {{and it was}} as if the very blood grew chill in my veins when I saw that he who had spoken was none other than the traitorous cur, Seth Jepson.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't say it has; but you <b>may</b> perhaps <b>fancy</b> by what I {{say that}} I myself {{admit that there}} is a claim. Mind; I do no such thing. Not in the least." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>may</b> be <b>fancy,</b> sir," [...] faltered the cook, {{lowering}} his eyes, [...] "but {{it does seem}} to me as though I can see a little misty sort o’ thing there. Ah, now it’s gone." ...|$|R
60|$|The bishop was now, as <b>may</b> be <b>fancied,</b> on his mettle, {{and without}} further parley, retired to the library. The {{rest of the}} men awaited his return, and beguiled the moments of {{expectation}} with princely havannas.|$|R
6000|$|You <b>may</b> <b>fancy</b> how {{the poor}} little man's {{appetite}} fell {{when he heard}} this speech. [...] "In the provost-marshal's hands?" [...] said his friend: [...] "then it is all over, indeed! When does my poor friend suffer, sir?" ...|$|E
60|$|JOHNNY. I'm no fool, mother, {{whatever}} {{some people}} <b>may</b> <b>fancy.</b> I dont {{set up to}} have as many ideas as the Governor; but what ideas I have are consecutive, at all events. I can think as well as talk.|$|E
6000|$|... "So," [...] {{she went}} on, {{in the same}} {{measured}} tone, [...] "we will forget everything you <b>may</b> <b>fancy</b> that you said, or that I did, since {{the time when you}} came in wounded and found that I had fainted." ...|$|E
6000|$|So long as I was prosperous, I'd dinners by the dozen, Was well-bred, witty, virtuous, and everybody's cousin; If luck should turn, as {{well she}} <b>may,</b> her <b>fancy</b> is so flexile, Will virtue, cousinship, and all return with her from exile? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have a fancy, Tresham (I {{am getting}} quite an old fellow now, you know, and old fellows <b>may</b> take <b>fancies</b> into their heads sometimes), {{to give up}} Polly, having found her, to no one but you. Will you take her from me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Hetty. [...] "You <b>may</b> have <b>fancied</b> so, but I hadn't. I was {{the only}} {{chaperon}} Barbara had, you see. I hope she didn't {{tell you not to}} lavish the dollar on whisky. No doubt you spent it wisely on tobacco." ...|$|R
60|$|You <b>may</b> <b>fancy</b> that Tom {{was quite}} content and happy all those seven years; {{but the truth}} is, he was not. He had always one thing on his mind, and that was--where little Ellie went, when she went home on Sundays.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you intend}} to insult George, at least you had best take care that his brother Harry is out of hearing!" [...] cried Lady Maria--on which we <b>may</b> <b>fancy</b> more curses uttered by Mr. Will, with regard to his twin kinsfolk.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good heavens!" [...] {{cried the}} Count, [...] "is it {{possible}} that the celebrated Poinsinet would take such a place? I would give the world to see him?" [...] And you <b>may</b> <b>fancy</b> how Poinsinet simpered and blushed when the introduction immediately took place.|$|E
6000|$|... "For shame! I am {{disappointed}} in you," [...] Bertha said, half in jest, half in earnest. [...] "You {{are not at}} all the person I thought you were. Whatever I <b>may</b> have <b>fancied</b> about you, I never imagined you a cynic or a grumbler." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said his}} {{companion}} musingly, [...] "it <b>may</b> be <b>fancy,</b> but I cannot resist {{the feeling that}} this country, and the world generally, are {{on the eve of}} a great change--and I do not think the Duke is the man for the epoch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But General Littlepage <b>may</b> not <b>fancy</b> it an {{improvement}} {{to have his}} land stripped of its pine. You know, Thousandacres, as well as I do, that pine is usually thought to greatly add {{to the value of}} lands hereabouts, the Hudson making it so easy to get it to market." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To-morrow--if I met any {{one that}} I fancied, {{and he would}} have me. But I rather think that any that I <b>may</b> <b>fancy</b> won't have me. In the first place, if I marry any one, the man must be quite {{indifferent}} to money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whew! I {{hope she}} has not {{fallen in love with}} me. She <b>may</b> <b>fancy</b> me her property--a private waif and stray. Better send for the Coast-guard officer, and let him claim me as {{belonging}} to the Admiralty, as flotsom, jetsom, and lagend; for I was all three last night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is my brother's widow, my dear friends," [...] Mrs. Frederick replied, [...] "and as such I think we're all {{bound to}} give her every {{attention}} and instruction on entering into the world. You <b>may</b> <b>fancy</b> {{there can be no}} MERCENARY motives in those whose DISAPPOINTMENTS are well known." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>may</b> be <b>fancy</b> ways," [...] I answered, [...] "necessary {{to you if}} {{later on}} you think of {{entering}} a competition. This morning, seeing we are late, I shouldn't {{worry too much about}} style. If I were you, this morning I should adopt the ordinary unimaginative method, and aim only at results." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do so bid you, signor," [...] she replied. [...] "Forget {{whatever}} you <b>may</b> have <b>fancied</b> {{in regard to}} me. If true to the outward senses, still it may be false in its essence; but the words of Beatrice Rappaccini's lips are true {{from the depths of}} the heart outward. Those you may believe." ...|$|R
6000|$|I like, as a {{thing that}} the reader's first <b>fancy</b> <b>may</b> strike, an old {{fashioned}} title-page, such as presents a tabular view of the volumes contents,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But look at this, Cytherea. If it {{is clear}} to us that the woman had blue eyes two years ago, she must have blue eyes now, {{whatever}} Mrs. Morris or anybody else <b>may</b> <b>fancy.</b> Any one would think that Manston could change the colour of a woman's eyes to hear you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We stayed accordingly; and did full {{justice to}} the good cheer,"--though poor Platen would {{certainly}} look flustered, one <b>may</b> <b>fancy.</b> [...] "But as the Prince was anxious {{to come up with}} his Majesty again, and knew not where he would meet him, we had to be very swift with the business.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Baroness! {{still at}} your cribbage?" [...] (We <b>may</b> <b>fancy</b> a noble Countess {{interrupting}} {{a game at}} cards between Theo and Aunt Bernstein.) [...] "Me and my Lord Esmond {{have come to see}} you! Go and shake hands with grandaunt, Esmond! and tell her ladyship that your lordship's a good boy!" ...|$|E
60|$|And he (O <b>may</b> we <b>fancy</b> so!), He, feeling time forever flow And flowing bear him {{forth and}} far away From that dear ingle where his life began And all his {{treasure}} lay - He, waxing into man, And ever farther, ever closer wound In this obstreperous world's ignoble round, From that poor prospect turned his face away.|$|R
60|$|The young peer {{was obliged}} to confess the truth; and then there arose such a clamor as <b>may</b> be <b>fancied</b> took place among the peacocks, when they {{discovered}} the daw among them in masquerade. Human nature could endure no more; and bowing to the company, I wished Lord Chatterino, very hurriedly, good-morning, and proceeded towards the tavern.|$|R
6000|$|... (I like, as a {{thing that}} the reader's first <b>fancy</b> <b>may</b> strike, [...] an old-fashioned title-page, [...] such as {{presents}} a tabular view of the volume's contents) ...|$|R
