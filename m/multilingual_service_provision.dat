40|$|Introduction: Meeting {{the complex}} health {{needs of people}} often {{requires}} interaction among numerous different sectors. No one service can adequately respond to the diverse care needs of consumers. Providers working more effectively together is frequently touted as the solution. Cross-sector <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> is defined as independent, yet interconnected sectors working together to better {{meet the needs of}} consumers and improve the quality and effectiveness of <b>service</b> <b>provision.</b> Cross-sector <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> is expected, yet much remains unknown about how it is conceptualised or its impact on health status. This umbrella review aims to clarify the critical attributes that shape cross-sector <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> by presenting {{the current state of the}} literature and building on the findings of the 2004 review by Sloper. Methods: Literature related to cross-sector <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> is immense, which poses a challenge for decision makers wishing to make evidence-informed decisions. An umbrella review was conducted to articulate the overall state of cross-sector <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> literature and examine the evidence to allow for the discovery of consistencies and discrepancies across the published knowledge base. Findings: Sixteen reviews met the inclusion criteria. Seven themes emerged: Focusing on the consumer, developing a shared vision of care, leadership involvement, <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> across the boundaries, adequately resourcing the arrangement, developing novel arrangements or aligning with existing relationships, and strengthening connections between sectors. Future research from a cross-organisational, rather than individual provider, perspective is needed to better understand what shapes cross-sector <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> at the boundaries. Conclusion: Findings aligned closely with the work done by Sloper and raise red flags related to reinventing what is already known. Future researchers should look to explore novel areas rather than looking into areas that have been explored at length. Evaluations of out-comes related to cross-sector <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> are still needed before any claims about effectiveness can be made...|$|R

The article looks at five types of services from that point of view.

Findings partially confirm the hypothesis: Slovak towns do outsource, though “insourcing” moderately prevails. However, a comparison of several research studies in the area indicates a trend towards higher outsourcing of such local <b>services</b> <b>provision.</b>   The findings show that public bodies do not always select the most suitable methods of <b>services</b> <b>provision,</b> {{as suggested by the}} transaction costs theory (the Brown-Potoski model).

40|$|In 1993, India {{introduced}} quota-based political {{reservations for}} women in rural areas with the objective to promote gender equality in human development by making rural <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> and local governance inclusive and responsive {{to the needs of}} women. Recent evidence shows that reservation policies for women (1) stimulate the political participation of women in rural areas, (2) shift rural <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> to public goods that reflect gender preferences, and (3) improve the access to and the quality of public services. Despite the suggested positive effects of women’s reservation policies on <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> and local governance, the gender bias in human development is still pronounced. This casts doubt on the effectiveness of reservation policies as an instrument for making rural <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> and local governance more gender equitable and raises questions about the nature and direction of the major constraints. This paper aims to qualify and quantify the role of political reservation policies for women as a determinant of rural <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> and local governance and seeks to identify the social, economic, and institutional factors that constrain effective local governance and rural <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> beyond the women’s reservation effect. Our empirical sample consists of 80 Gram Panchayats (GP) and 966 households in 12 districts in Karnataka in 2006. In contrast to the main existing literature, the empirical evidence from (non-) linear probability models lends weak support to the existence of gender effects of reservation policies on local governance and rural <b>service</b> <b>provision.</b> The local governance and service delivery outcomes are predominantly determined by social, economic, and institutional factors that are unrelated to women’s reservation requirements. For example, (1) individual characteristics such as literacy, household institutional and political linkages, or the household location in the GP and (2) GP-specific factors such as the degree of community involvement in <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> and the fiscal devolution of activities {{are more likely to have}} a significant effect on <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> and governance than reservation policies for women. These results suggest that women’s reservation policies per se are insufficient means for making rural <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> and local governance more inclusive and gender equitable. In addition, it appears that gender-integrated policy approaches that are targeted at both women and men are needed. " [...] from authors' abstractDiscussion paperNon-PRIFPRI 1; GRP 37 DSG...|$|R

The dominant workforce focus in the rural health literature, while revealing issues of shortage of maldistribution, does not describe <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> in rural towns.

This paper describes a methodology to explore specific aspects of rural health <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> with an initial focus on understanding rurality {{as it pertains to}} rural physiotherapy <b>service</b> <b>provision.</b> Method: A system theory-case study heuristic combined with a sequential mixed methods approach to provide a framework for both quantitative and qualitative exploration across sites. Stakeholder perspectives were obtained through surveys and in depth interviews. The investigation site was a large area of one Australian state with a mix of rural, regional and remote communities. Results: 39 surveys were received from 11 locations within the investigation site and 19 in depth interviews were conducted. Stakeholder perspectives of rurality and workforce numbers informed the development of six case types relevant to the exploration of rural physiotherapy <b>service</b> <b>provision.</b> Participant perspective of rurality often differed with the geographical classification of their location. The numbers of onsite colleagues and local access to health services contributed to participant perceptions of rurality.
