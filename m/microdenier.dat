5000|$|Denier [...] or den (abbreviated D), {{a unit of}} {{measure for}} the linear mass density of fibers, is the mass in grams per 9000 meters of the fiber. The denier {{is based on a}} natural reference: a single strand of silk is {{approximately}} one denier; a 9000-meter strand of silk weighs about one gram. The term denier comes from the French denier, a coin of small value (worth [...] sou). Applied to yarn, a denier was held to be equal in weight to 1/24 oz. <b>Microdenier</b> describes filaments that weigh less than 1 g per 9000 m.|$|E

In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the diffusion of disperse dye between substrates and hydrophobic auxiliaries, two different kinds and dosages of water repellent agents were applied to conventional and <b>microdenier</b> polyester by measuring their K/S value, color difference (â–³E) and extracted absorbance. The results illustrated that irrespective of the kind or of the dosage of water repellent agents, dye migration increased upon the employment of water repellent, and heat treatment will accelerate the dye migration process. ...|$|E
