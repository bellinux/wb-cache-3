5|$|Near {{the surface}} of the Earth, its {{magnetic}} field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned {{at the center of the}} Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth. The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar <b>magnet,</b> with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole. This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a <b>magnet</b> is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a <b>magnet</b> attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's <b>magnet.</b> The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of John Smith's sales {{are of the}} nitrogenated Extra Smooth product, although a cask conditioned variant is available nationally. A stronger variant called <b>Magnet</b> is also available in the North East of England. John Smith's Cask and <b>Magnet</b> are produced under licence by Cameron's in Hartlepool.|$|E
5|$|This {{relationship}} between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for {{it led to}} Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821. Faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent <b>magnet</b> sitting {{in a pool of}} mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the <b>magnet</b> and dipped into the mercury. The <b>magnet</b> exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the <b>magnet</b> {{for as long as the}} current was maintained.|$|E
50|$|<b>Magnets</b> are {{available}} {{in a variety of}} shapes. However, permanent <b>magnets</b> are most frequently 'C' shaped, and superconducting <b>magnets</b> most frequently cylindrical. However, C-shaped superconducting <b>magnets</b> and box-shaped permanent <b>magnets</b> have also been used.|$|R
50|$|Most common radio <b>magnets,</b> {{including}} {{those used in}} loudspeakers, are ferrite <b>magnets.</b> Ferrite <b>magnets</b> have largely displaced Alnico <b>magnets</b> in these applications.|$|R
5000|$|Rare-earth <b>magnets</b> {{are strong}} {{permanent}} <b>magnets</b> made from alloys of {{rare earth elements}} (elements in the lanthanide series, plus scandium and yttrium). [...] Developed in the 1970s and '80s, rare-earth <b>magnets</b> are the strongest type of permanent <b>magnets</b> made, producing significantly stronger magnetic fields than other types such as ferrite or alnico <b>magnets.</b> The magnetic field typically produced by rare-earth <b>magnets</b> can exceed 1.4 teslas, whereas ferrite or ceramic <b>magnets</b> typically exhibit fields of 0.5 to 1 tesla. There are two types: neodymium <b>magnets</b> and samarium-cobalt <b>magnets.</b> Magnetostrictive rare-earth <b>magnets</b> such as Terfenol-D also have applications—e.g. in loudspeakers. Rare earth <b>magnets</b> are extremely brittle and also vulnerable to corrosion, so they are usually plated or coated {{to protect them from}} breaking, chipping, or crumbling into powder.|$|R
5|$|After a 1994 {{plan was}} {{approved}} and a bond issue passed, additional elementary <b>magnet</b> schools were opened and district attendance plans redrawn, {{which resulted in}} the Topeka schools meeting court standards of racial balance by 1998.

5|$|All {{students}} {{enroll in}} one of five <b>magnet</b> programs. The High School University (HSU) <b>magnet</b> offers a traditional college preparatory curriculum with electives. The Math/Science/Technology (MST) <b>magnet</b> specifically prepares students for college programs in engineering, science and math. Minimal requirements for MST students include courses in algebra, trigonometry, calculus (including mandatory AP Calculus), biology, chemistry and computer programming. The Journalism & Communication (J) <b>magnet</b> focuses on journalism, publishing, and media production. To earn class credit, J students can participate in production of the school's national award-winning yearbook (The Crimson), student newspaper (The Crimson Record), award-winning literary magazine (One Blue Wall), multimedia website (RedEye) or a weekly morning television show called Manual AM, which is broadcast to all classrooms. The J program was formerly known as CMA (Communications and Media Arts), but the name was changed so that the Manual program would stand out from others in the district with similar names.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>magnet</b> school founded {{to promote}} school integration, racial and {{economic}} diversity {{have been important}} factors in admissions decisions. The student body was 52.1percent black, 41.7percent low income, and 7.7percent disabled in 2009–10. In 2007, {{in response to a}} US Supreme Court decision prohibiting racial criteria for assigning students to public schools, CPS eliminated race and gender as determining factors in <b>magnet</b> school admissions. School officials insist this will have little impact, despite parent concerns that the decision will erode diversity.|$|E
40|$|The {{protection}} of superconducting <b>magnets</b> {{in case of}} a quench has to be considered already in the design phase for the proton-proton collider LHC. The {{protection of}} main dipole and quadrupole <b>magnets,</b> based on cold diodes and quench heaters, is reported elsewhere [1]. In this paper the protection of other <b>magnets</b> is discussed. In the arcs some of the <b>magnets</b> are connected in series: sextupole <b>magnets</b> to correct the lattice chromaticity, small sextupole and decapole <b>magnets</b> to correct systematic field errors of the dipoles and octupole <b>magnets.</b> The <b>magnets</b> in the arcs to correct horizontal and vertical closed orbit excursions are powered individually. In the insertions other superconducting <b>magnets</b> will be used: quadrupole <b>magnets</b> for the low-beta insertions, orbit corrector <b>magnets,</b> etc. Some <b>magnets</b> will be constructed with sufficient copper stabilization to safely absorb the energy. For other <b>magnets</b> different methods of protection after the detection of a quench in the circuit are envisaged...|$|R

Therefore, each power supply will be rated to deliver the necessary power to only 40 quadrupole <b>magnets.</b> The two families of sextupole <b>magnets</b> in the injector synchrotron each consists of 32 sextupole <b>magnets</b> connected in series, powered by a phase-controlled power supply.

5|$|The {{chessboard}} {{on the top}} of {{the cabinet}} was thin enough to allow for a magnetic linkage. Each piece in the chess set had a small, strong <b>magnet</b> attached to its base, and when they were placed on the board the pieces would attract a <b>magnet</b> attached to a string under their specific places on the board. This allowed the director inside the machine to see which pieces moved where on the chess board. The bottom of the chessboard had corresponding numbers, 1–64, allowing the director to see which places on the board were affected by a player's move. The internal magnets were positioned in a way that outside magnetic forces did not influence them, and Kempelen would often allow a large <b>magnet</b> to sit at the side of the board in an attempt to show that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.|$|E

50|$|A common {{method of}} {{tampering}} on mechanical disk meters is to attach <b>magnets</b> {{to the outside}} of the meter.
