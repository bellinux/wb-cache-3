25|$|Prior to the {{invasion}} of Europe in June 1944, <b>more</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> dying in Home Front accidents than on World War II battlefields. Henry J.

5000|$|According to Consumer Reports, [...] "1.1 {{million or}} <b>more</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> sickened {{each year by}} undercooked, tainted chicken." [...] A USDA study {{discovered}} E. coli (Biotype I) in 99% of supermarket chicken, the result of chicken butchering not being a sterile process. However, the same study also shows that the strain of E. coli found was always a non-lethal form, and no chicken had any of the pathenogenic O157:H7 serotype. Many of these chickens, furthermore, had relatively low levels of contamination.|$|E
5000|$|The {{thought of}} whether the cost is too high also raises other points in the media. John Horrigan of the Pew Research Center commented that {{the high cost of}} {{broadband}} now is why <b>more</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> not already using it. There is also the consideration that not every American has access to a computer. Although smartphones with Internet capabilities have been on the rise for many years now, there is still a reason the entire nation is not [...] "online". Whether it is the cost of an Internet-ready device or computer, or obtaining Internet service, cost is still a big factor for this technology. In terms of cost, one-third of Americans who do not have broadband access say cost prohibits them from purchasing it.|$|E

5000|$|Policies {{that affect}} {{the value of the}} U.S. dollar {{relative}} to other currencies also affect employment levels. Economist Christina Romer wrote in May 2011: [...] "A weaker dollar means that our goods are cheaper relative to foreign goods. That stimulates our exports and reduces our imports. Higher net exports raise domestic production and employment. Foreign goods are more expensive, but <b>more</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> working. Given the desperate need for jobs, on net we are almost surely better off with a weaker dollar for a while." [...] Economist Paul Krugman wrote in May 2011: [...] "First, what's driving the turnaround in our manufacturing trade? The main answer is that the U.S. dollar has fallen against other currencies, helping give U.S.-based manufacturing a cost advantage. A weaker dollar, it turns out, was just what U.S. industry needed." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dietitians and nutritionists were {{generally}} {{critical of the}} milk; Alissa Rumsey, {{a spokesperson for the}} Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics expressed, [...] "When you really look at the numbers, it can sound appealing, but in general most Americans are already getting enough protein," [...] adding, [...] "If you need more, eat an egg or a handful of almonds. And people who need more calcium should up their intake of dark leafy greens, not the so-called Frankenmilk." [...] Registered dietitian Keri Gans claimed, [...] "milk is already a great package of nutrients; I’m not quite sure why it needs to be changed," [...] and commented on the removal of sugar in Fairlife milk with, [...] "I never looked at the sugar in milk as a problem." [...] Meredith Engel of New York Daily News speculated that, [...] "it’s clear why Coke is {{trying to get into the}} milk business: More and <b>more</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> turning away from sugary soft drinks, and soda sales fell to a 19-year-low in 2013."

While the current research is not without its problems and difficulties, the acupuncture research community has matured and is facing its challenges by developing better research methodologies, applying new technologies, and engaging in more creative and innovative translational research.
