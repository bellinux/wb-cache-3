40|$|An {{easy and}} fast gel {{diffusion}} assay for detecting and <b>monitoring</b> <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> by quantification of fluorescein is described. By measuring {{the intensity of}} fluorescein, {{it is possible to}} obtain a calibration curve with a regression coefficient better than by using the radius of fluorescent haloes. Through the quantification of fluorescence intensity of fluorescein released after the hydrolysis of a fluorescent ester, fluorescein dibutyrate, used as substrate in agar plates, commercial and skimmed milk lipase activity were studied. Moreover, with this method, lipase activity can be monitored in reaction medium that contains compounds which are affected by turbidity or cause measurement interference for UV-spectrophotometer and fluorimeter. In this experiment, boiled skimmed milk was dispersed in the agar gel with fluorescein dibutyrate, and it was used as a reaction medium to mimic natural conditions. The development of such an assay has a potential for applications in industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to food production and monitoring...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Triacylglycerol <b>lipase</b> <b>activities</b> of homogenates and {{subcellular}} {{fractions of}} rat liver were measured under optimal conditions at pH 7. 5 using emulsified tri [l-' 4 C]oleoylglycerol as substrate. Twenty-four hr after administration of streptozotocin, hepatic alkaline <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> was 39 % of normal, and this {{lower level of}} activity was observed at 72 hr and 7 days. after streptozotocin injection. After 24 hr of starvation, <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> also was significantly lower (35 %) than normal. Insulin (35 U regular/kg body weight) had no acute (90 min) effect on the hepatic <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> of either normal or diabetic rats.

40|$|Lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> in {{adipose tissue}} and muscle is {{modulated}} {{by changes in}} the pattern of food intake. We have measured total lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> in adipose tissue and muscle of male Wistar rats (N = 6 - 10), weighing 200 - 250 g (~ 12 weeks), during the refeeding/fasting state following 24 h of fasting. Lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> in tissue homogenates was evaluated using a [³H]-triolein-containing substrate, and released [³H]-free fatty acids were extracted and quantified by liquid scintillation. Adipose tissue lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> did not completely recover within 2 h of refeeding (60 % of refed ad libitum values). Cardiac lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> remained increased even 2 h after refeeding (100 % of refed ad libitum values), whereas no significant changes were observed in the soleus and diaphragm muscles. Adipose tissue lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activities</b> were consistently higher than the highest skeletal muscle or heart values. It is therefore likely that adipose tissue, rather than muscle makes the major contribution to triacylglycerol clearance. There was concomitant relatively high lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> in both adipose tissue and cardiac muscle during the first few hours of refeeding, therefore cardiac muscle may contribute significantly to triacylglycerol clearance during this period. The results suggest that during fasting, increased lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> provides a complementary source of free fatty acids from circulating triacylglycerol, allowing the heart to maintain its continuous, high-energy expenditure...|$|R
30|$|Metal ions {{are known}} to be able to stimulate or inhibit <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> without any {{cofactor}} (Gupta et al. 2004). According to the results of this study, most of the lipases tested were not influenced by 0.1  mM and 10  mM of metal ions. The concentration of metal ions at 0.1  mM might be too low to influence the <b>lipase</b> <b>activity.</b> Lu et al. had reported that metal ions at this concentration did not affect <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> of Cupriavidus necator H 16 as much as 1  mM of metal ions (Lu et al. 2013). In this study, 5 out of 9 lipases were affected by 0.1  mM metal ions as shown by decreasing opacity of hydrolysis spots on film. On the other hand, there was not much study on the effect of 10  mM of metal ions on <b>lipase</b> <b>activity.</b> According to Abramic et al. 10  mM of Ca 2 + slightly increased <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> of Streptomyces rimosus while Cu 2 + at this concentration slightly reduced its <b>lipase</b> <b>activity.</b> By comparing to 1  mM, 10  mM of metal ions tend to reduce <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> (Abramić et al. 1999). However, in this study, 10  mM of metal ions did not influence the <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> on P(3 HB-co- 4 HB) film. Thus, more studies should be carried out to investigate the reason behind this observation. Results from this study had shown that 1  mM of Cu 2 + decreased or inhibited <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> of most tested lipases. Transition metal ions such as Cu 2 + and Mn 2 + have the ability to inhibit <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> because the ions will interact with enzyme surface charge that in turn reduce the enzyme stability and change its conformation (El-Rahman et al. 2006). On the other hand, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + have the ability to stimulate <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> by altering the structure of catalytic site of lipase (Williams 1953). Apart from that, metal ions may act as stabilizers for tertiary lipase structure or activate water molecules for catalysis (Jaeger et al. 1999).|$|R
30|$|Potential {{compounds}} from Intsia palembanica methanol extracts were isolated. Three isolated compounds {{as well as}} 7 reported compounds from Merbau {{were analyzed}} {{for their ability to}} inhibit the <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> of Propionibacterium acnes. Lipase was isolated from P. acnes and used as enzyme for <b>activity</b> analysis. The <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> test was performed using the 2, 3 -dimercapto- 1 -propanol tributyrate (BALB) method. The results showed that methanol extract and water fraction were active to inhibit <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> but n-hexane fraction and EtOAc fraction did not reach 50  % inhibition until 500  μg/ml. EtOAc fraction consisted of flavonoid, naringenin, robinetin, and (+)-epirobidanol accelerated the <b>lipase</b> <b>activity.</b> The other 7 compounds showed inhibitory <b>activity</b> of <b>lipase</b> in a concentration-dependent manner. In conclusion, fustin is the most active compound to inhibit the P. acnes <b>lipase</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of NaCl-resistant, neutral triacylglycerol hydrolase (<b>lipase)</b> <b>activity</b> in rat adrenal gland, ovary and testis was studied. Both adrenals and ovaries but not testes {{were found to}} contain such a <b>lipase.</b> The <b>activity</b> of the enzyme in the adrenal gland was lowered during cortisol treatment and hypothyroidism. An elevated adrenal <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> was found during hyperthyroidism. Pseudo-pregnant and lactating rats had higher ovarian <b>lipase</b> <b>activities</b> than cyclic rats. Ovarian <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> in lactating rats {{was positively correlated with}} the serum concentrations of progesterone and of 20 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and negatively correlated with the high-density-lipoprotein non-esterified cholesterol concentration. The <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> of adrenals and of ovaries was largely releasable from these organs by heparin and could be inhibited by an antibody against heparin-releasable liver lipase. This indicated that the lipase is extracellularly located and is similar to 'liver' lipase. A possible role of this lipase in adrenals and ovaries is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> in intact epididymal {{adipose tissue}} of fasted rats {{increased}} rapidly after treatment with insulin in vivo. In contrast, lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> in adipocytes {{isolated from the}} contralateral fat pads remained essentially unchanged. When adipocytes were incubated for 30 min at ambient temperature in vitro, about 2 times more lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> {{was found in the}} medium of cells from insulin-treated rats than in medium from cells of control animals. Following insulin treatment, extracts of tissue acetone powders separated by gel chromatography showed increases in both enzyme activity fractions obtained (designated lipoprotein lipase a and b). However, no consistent differences were observed between fractions derived from adipocyte acetone powders of insulin-treated and control animals. All the observed effects of insulin on lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> were abolished by cycloheximide treatment in vivo. These data indicate that following insulin treatment, increased lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> in adipose tissue results from enhanced enzyme secretion by the fat cell and subsequent accumulation in the tissue, thus implicating the adipocyte secretory mechanism as a major site of regulation of lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> in adipose tissue...|$|R
40|$|Two {{triacylglycerol}} <b>lipase</b> <b>activities</b> {{were characterized}} after partial purification from pig post-heparin plasma. These two <b>lipase</b> <b>activities</b> were eluted sequentially with a NaCl gradient from columns containing Sepharose with covalently linked heparin. The first <b>lipase</b> <b>activity,</b> which was eluted at 0. 75 M-NaCl, was not inhibited at 28 degrees C {{in the presence}} of 1 M-NaCl and was not further activated by plasma apolipoproteins. The absence of this <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> from post-heparin plasma from hepatectomized pigs indicates that the liver plays a role in the synthesis of this enzyme. A second <b>lipase</b> <b>activity,</b> which was eluted at 1. 2 M-NaCl, was inhibited when assayed {{in the presence of}} 1. 0 M-NaCl and was activated 14 -fold by an apolipoprotein isolated from human very-low-density lipoprotein.

40|$|The {{effect of}} 17 beta-estradiol or {{progesterone}} administration on adipose tissue lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> was studied in male and ovariectomized female rats. Lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> {{was measured in}} acetone-ether-extracted preparations of adipose tissue with doubly labeled (14 C-fatty acid, 3 H-glyceryl) chylomicron triglyceride as substrate. Administration of 17 beta-estradiol to male rats lowered adipose tissue lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> from 8. 22 plus or minus 1. 8 U/g (1 U = 1 mumol triglyceride hydrolyzed per h) to 4. 96 plus or minus 0. 5 U/g in the treated group. Ovariectomy increased adipose tissue lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> from 10. 4 plus or minus 1. 8 U/g in controls to 22. 7 plus or minus 4. 3 U/g. 17 beta-Estradiol administration to ovariectomized rats cuased a marked fall in adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity: 17 beta-estradiol (2. 5 mug/day) lowered the enzyme activity to 9. 00 plus or minus 1. 2 U/g, whereas 25 mug/day further decreased lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> to 3. 2 plus or minus 0. 6 U/g. Blood triglyceride levels increased from 0. 8 plus or minus 0. 05 mumol/ml in ovariectomized rats to 1. 4 plus or minus 0. 09 mumol/ml in 25 mug/day 17 beta-estradiol-treated rats. Progesterone administration did not affect adipose tissue lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> in either male or ovariectomized rats. Heart and lung lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> was unaffected by hormone treatment.

30|$|Lipases {{are widely}} used in {{different}} applications such as detergents, cosmetics, food flavorings, diesels, papers and pulps. Thus, measurement of <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> is an important process for the quantification of lipases. Different from other reported <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> assays, P(3 HB-co- 4 HB) is an eco-friendly option for lipase assay substrate as it is readily biodegradable.

40|$|Lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> in {{adipose tissue}} {{responds}} rapidly {{to changes in}} the physiological state. To study what mechanisms are involved in the regulation, guinea pigs were fasted and the decrease in adipose-tissue lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> was compared with the decreases in mRNA and lipase synthesis. The mRNA pattern (three species) did not change. There was a close parallelism between the abundance of lipase mRNA and relative lipase synthesis (immunoprecipitable 35 S-labelled lipoprotein lipase as fraction of total [35 S]protein after pulse-labelling with [35 S]methionine). Total protein synthesis decreased on fasting, compounding the decrease in relative lipase synthesis. Lipoprotein lipase mRNA changed similarly in fat-pads and in isolated adipocytes, whereas <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> changed more in the pads, indicating disproportionally large changes in extracellularly located lipase. In old guinea pigs the decreases in lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>lipase</b> synthesis were comparable, but in young animals the change in <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> was substantially larger than the change in lipase synthesis. Refeeding of fasted young guinea pigs with glucose resulted in a rapid increase in lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity,</b> but there was only a small change in lipase mRNA. Old animals responded slowly to refeeding. The results indicate that in older animals the major mechanism for regulation of adipose lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> is a relatively slow change in lipase mRNA, whereas in younger animals an additional, more rapid, regulation is exerted on the transport and turnover of the enzyme...|$|R

An esterase null mutant was used to confirm that the enzyme activity was due to a distinct lipase and not non-specific activity from esterase 6 which is also abundant in accessory glands. The properties of the accessory-gland lipase were investigated, and pH optima and substrate utilization suggest that it has some similarities to vertebrate bile-salt-stimulated <b>lipase.</b> <b>Lipase</b> <b>activity</b> is significantly reduced in males and increased in females shortly after mating.

40|$|The role {{of insulin}} in the {{regulation}} of adipose tissue lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> in humans was investigated in 11 normal subjects and compared {{with the effects of}} 0. 9 % saline infusions in five control subjects. After a basal adipose tissue biopsy for lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity,</b> insulin was rapidly infused to achieve and maintain serum levels of approximately 70 microunits/ml while plasma glucose was kept at basal concentrations. Free fatty acids in serum fell to 27 +/- 3 % of basal by 20 min (t = 5. 19, P less than 0. 001) and triglycerides decreased to 77 +/- 3 % of basal by 80 min (t = 3. 76, P less than 0. 01). Adipose tissue lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> failed to increase significantly above that measured in controls by the first 3 h of the study. By 6 h of the infusion a stimulatory effect of insulin on adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase was found (t = 3. 94, P less than 0. 01).

The increase in adipose tissue lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> at 6 h, however, was inversely related to the basal <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> (r = - 0. 690, P less than 0. 02).

30|$|It {{is known}} that lipases act on the {{boundary}} of aqueous and oil interface. To improve the accessibility of both buffer and substrate, surfactants or emulsifiers are added. Detergents {{have been shown to}} cause protein aggregation because protein-detergent interactions are generally hydrophobic in nature (Møller and Le Maire 1993). In this study, it was also found that detergents are able to affect <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> on solid P(3 HB-co- 4 HB) films. Four types of detergents were tested at different concentrations (0.01, 0.1 and 1  %). For detergents with 0.01  % of concentration, <b>lipase</b> <b>activities</b> of most <b>lipases</b> in this study were barely affected but lipase from R. arrhizus was significantly reduced. Most of the lipases were not affected by this concentration of detergents because lower concentration of detergents was suspected to have minimal influence on the <b>lipases.</b> <b>Lipase</b> <b>activities</b> from C. antarctica and C. rugosa was stimulated by 0.1  % of SDS, Tween 20 and Tween 80 while 0.1  % of Tween 20 and Tween 80 stimulated the <b>lipase</b> <b>activities</b> from M. javanicus. <b>Lipase</b> <b>activities</b> on P(3 HB-co- 4 HB) film were inhibited after addition of 1  % detergents. This result suggested detergents at this concentration had exceeded its critical micelle concentration (CMC) and formed micelles (Moh’d and Wiegel 2010). This in turn inhibited <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> when the micelles were bound to the lipase lid and triggered change of lipase conformation (Reis et al. 2009). Addition of small amount of detergent is able to enhance <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> by changing the lipase’s conformation or interfacial properties (Reis et al. 2009). However, <b>activities</b> of other <b>lipases</b> on the film were mostly reduced or inhibited by detergents because detergents were able to compete with the active sites of lipases and therefore inhibit the <b>lipase</b> <b>activities</b> (Rathi et al. 2001; Quyen et al. 2005). Besides, detergents were found to form a protective layer on lipase substrate and in turn prevented accessibility of lipase towards substrates (Yao et al. 2013).|$|R

Both <b>lipase</b> <b>activities</b> are sensitive to vesicle size, but in opposite ways: while phospholipase C is higher with larger vesicles, sphingomyelinase activity is lower.

40|$|When {{isolated}} fat-cells are incubated at 25 degrees C in serum-based media containing glucose, insulin and heparin, {{the rise}} {{that occurs in}} the clearing-factor <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> of the incubation medium is inhibited by colchicine. The rise in the fat-cell clearing-factor <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> that occurs during similar incubations {{in the absence of}} heparin is not affected by colchicine...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{clinical}} isolates of Pseudomonas cepacia {{from the}} sputum of cystic fibrosis patients were examined for {{the ability to}} produce lipase. Lipase substrates used included egg yolk agar, four different polyoxyethylene sorbitans (Tweens), and p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine, a chromogenic substrate used to assay for phospholipase C. <b>Lipase</b> <b>activity</b> was detected in the filtrates of organisms grown to the exponential phase in either tryptose minimal medium or chemically defined medium. <b>Lipase</b> <b>activity</b> increased in the filtrates if the cultures were allowed to proceed into the stationary phase. None of the isolates produced phospholipase C. <b>Lipase</b> <b>activity</b> on Tween 20 ranged from 41. 6 X 10 (- 3) to 640. 0 X 10 (- 3) U/micrograms of protein. The activity was similar or slightly lower when Tween 40, 60, or 80 {{was used as the}} substrate. There was no correlation between <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> on Tween and that demonstrated on egg yolk agar. <b>Lipase</b> <b>activity</b> increased as pH increased from 7. 0 to 9. 0. Boiling for 5 min resulted in 66 % loss of enzyme activity. The remaining activity continued to decrease with increasing boiling time. The enzyme was purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G- 200, and the resultant preparation, when subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, resulted in a single protein band (molecular weight, approximately 25, 000) from which <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> could be eluted. The purified lipase was not cytotoxic to HeLa cells, nor was it toxic when injected intravenously into mice...|$|R
40|$|The genus Leptospira can {{be divided}} into three groups based on purine {{analogue}} sensitivity and <b>lipase</b> (trioleinase) <b>activity.</b> Group 1 contains members of the “parasitic complex” of leptospires which initially cannot grow in media containing 10 μg of 2, 6 -diaminopurine (DAP) per ml or 200 μg of 8 -azaguanine per ml. In addition, leptospires in this group possess <b>lipase</b> <b>activity.</b> Group 2 also contains members of the “parasitic complex” of leptospires. Although these leptospires are similarly sensitive to 8 -azaguanine, they differ from group 1 leptospires in that they grow in media containing 10 μg of DAP per ml, and they do not possess detectable <b>lipase</b> <b>activity.</b> Group 3 consists of leptospires belonging to the “biflexa complex. ” These leptospires are resistant to both purine analogues and have <b>lipase</b> <b>activity...</b>|$|R
30|$|It {{was shown}} that <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> {{increased}} upon cell growth (see Fig.  3 d). Consistent with that, {{we found that}} the transcription level of lipase encoding gene ZS 6 lipA was increased from 0.8 arbitrary unit (a.u.) at 8  h to 1.7 a.u. at 16  h (Fig.  4 g). These results suggested that <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> was transcriptionally regulated in Serratia sp. ZS 6.|$|R

40|$|Lipase {{production}} of 425 S. aureus strains isolated from patients with different clinical diagnoses and healthy carriers were {{measured by a}} specific method, using emulsified trioleoylglycerol substrate. Strains isolated from patients with septicemia showed significantly higher <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> than osteomyelitis strains (p = 0. 011), impetigo strains (p = 0. 002) and strains isolated from healthy relatives of patients with recurrent furunculosis (p = 0. 019). Recurrent furunculosis and pyomyositis strains had significantly higher (p = 0. 002 and 0. 032, respectively) <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> than septicemia strains. S. aureus strains isolated from patients with a significant antibody response in an antilipase ELISA did not show a higher <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> in culture supernatants than strains from patients without a significant antibody response. The <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> was significantly higher in strains isolated from deep or subcutaneous infections, i. e., septicemia, pyomyositis, osteomyelitis, aerobic and anaerobic furunculosis, than in strains from superficial infections, i. e. impetigo, or from nasal mucosa...|$|R
40|$|Supplementation with {{conjugated}} {{linoleic acid}} may reduce fat body mass and increase lean body mass in various species. Some {{studies have demonstrated that}} {{conjugated linoleic acid}} reduces body fat, in part, by inhibiting the <b>activity</b> of lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> in adipocytes. The objective of this work was to study the effect of conjugated linoleic acid supplementation on lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocyte culture. 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes received linoleic acid (group C) or conjugated linoleic acid (group AE, supplemented with AdvantEdge® CLA, and group CO, supplemented with CLA One®) in concentrations of 1 mmol/L. Heparin-releasable lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> was analyzed by means of a 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocyte culture. After 7 days, heparin-releasable lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity</b> was lower in the groups AE and CO supplemented with conjugated linoleic acid. These results suggest that one of the mechanisms by which CLA is capable of reducing body fat is by reducing lipoprotein <b>lipase</b> <b>activity...</b>|$|R
