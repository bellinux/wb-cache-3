25|$|The {{number of}} murders and assaults perpetrated upon Negroes is very great; we can form only an approximative {{estimate}} {{of what is}} going on in those parts of the South which are not closely garrisoned, and from which no regular reports are received, by what occurs under the very eyes of our military authorities. As to my personal experience, I will only mention that during my two days sojourn at Atlanta, one Negro was stabbed with fatal effect on the street, and three were poisoned, one of whom died. While I was at Montgomery, one negro was cut across the throat evidently with intent to kill, and another was shot, but both escaped with their lives. Several papers attached to this report give an account of the number of capital cases that occurred at certain places during a certain period of time. It is a sad fact that the perpetration of those acts is not confined to that class of people which <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> rabble.|$|E

[...] From experiences like that, and as inspired by psychoanalysts such as Wilhelm Reich and Freud, Moreno began to develop psychodrama. After moving to the United States in 1925, Moreno introduced his work with psychodrama to American psychologists. [...] He began this work with children, and then eventually moved on to large group psychodrama sessions that he held at Impromptu Group Theatre at Carnegie Hall. These sessions established Moreno's name, not only in psychological circles, but also among non-psychologists. [...] Moreno continued to teach his method of psychodrama, leading sessions until his death in 1974.|$|E
500|$|His {{blend of}} the {{classical}} and flamenco styles, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "new flamenco" [...] (nuevo flamenco), led music critic Eric McLean of the Montreal Gazette to proclaim: [...] "It is Laucke's interest in flamenco that makes him special: He <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> first interpreter of flamenco music, {{in the sense that he}} borrows these traditional works by Sabicas, Carlos Montoya and Paco de Lucía, and employs them in his own fashion, a practice to which they agree." [...] Laucke summarized: [...] "The Spanish guitar remains my first love. The flamenco guitar is my passion." [...] According to The Music Scene magazine published by Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN), he is one of [...] "five of Canada's best-known soloists" [...] and the Canadian federal and provincial governments gave him [...] "full recognition as the person who has done more for the guitar in this country than anyone else".|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} were conceived in 1926 by Edward Stratemeyer, {{founder of the}} Stratemeyer Syndicate, a book-packaging firm. Stratemeyer initially pitched the new series to publishers Grosset & Dunlap and suggested that the boys <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Keene Boys, the Scott Boys, the Hart Boys, or the Bixby Boys. Grosset & Dunlap editors, for reasons unknown, chose the name [...] "The Hardy Boys" [...] and approved the project. Stratemeyer hired Canadian Leslie McFarlane to ghostwrite the first volumes in the series. McFarlane would author nineteen of the first twenty-five volumes in the series. Subsequent titles {{have been written by}} a number of different ghostwriters, all under the pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon. The first three titles were published in 1927, and were an immediate success: by mid-1929 over 115,000 books had been sold. So successful was the series that Stratemeyer created the character of Nancy Drew as a female counterpart to the Hardys.|$|E

The sign-value systems use only the geometric numerals and the positional systems use only the arithmetic numerals. A sign-value system does not need arithmetic numerals because they are made by repetition (except for the Ionic system), and a positional system does not need geometric numerals because they are made by position. However, the spoken language uses both arithmetic and geometric numerals.|$|E
