Firstly, a mechanistic cutting force model for bull-nose end mill is established. Secondly, the machining process characteristics for four-axis <b>milling</b> of ring-shaped <b>casings</b> are discussed. A slice-based method is proposed for prediction the cutter-workpiece engagements. Then, the cutting forces {{with three different}} lead angles are predicted and compared with the corresponding experimental values. The results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the presented prediction approach...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringDuring {{plug and}} abandonment, {{there can be}} a need for {{removing}} casing to ensure that a proper cement barrier can be set. The conventional method for doing this is by performing milling operations. Conventional milling operations are very time consuming, costly and also involves major HSE aspects. New technology for performing milling operations are developed with the purpose to perform this operation more safe and efficiently. During milling operations huge amounts of swarf is generated. By milling a section of 50 meters, one can actually generate 4 tons of swarf! The swarf which is basically metal cuttings from the <b>milled</b> <b>casing</b> has to be transported away from the platform site. Some platforms have their own swarf handling units while others don’t. Swarf may cause a lot of damages to equipment, and people and during transportation it may be self-­‐firing. Roughnecks have to use special gloves when working with swarf due to its sharp edges. If one can improve the milling operations or implement better alternatives for removing casing it will be beneficial both economically and for HSE considerations. Alternative technologies to milling exist; this will be further discussed in this thesis. The pro and cons with this alternative technology will be discussed, as well as the technology development within the milling operations. To get the overall picture this thesis starts with a description of P&A, and some important terminology {{that it is important to}} have in place. Then the governing regulations from NORSOK D 010 are presented with respect to P&A. The newest revision of NORSOK D 010, rev 4 that was published in June 2013 is later compared with the previous revision of NORSOK D 010, rev 3. The latest part is more academic with some simulations in Matlab. For the simulation part an existing steady state two phase model is implemented. This steady state model is modified for its intended use. The purpose with this modified model is to study the ECD effects during milling operations. Different parameters such as the slip ratio and the mill rate will be adjusted, and the results will be visualised in excel. Steel has a large density and for large concentrations of swarf {{there can be a}} problem related to fracturing of the well. The model (programmed in Matlab) will be used to study the effects of different milling rates. The results are discussed to see the trends...|$|R
50|$|Mount Pleasant Mill {{worked by}} wind until 1933 {{and by a}} diesel single {{cylinder}} Crossley engine until 1973. Fred Banks, who ran it then, also owned Alford Windmill. It is the only windmill in the area beside Heapham Mill with original and unrestored equipment and machinery of the 1920s and 1930s. The original cap with the oak cap frame is still in place. The original windshaft, wallower, upright shaft and great spur wheel are made of cast iron, as are the tooth ring of the wooden brakewheel with its timber clasp arm construction and wooden brake, all installed in the 1930s. A refinement to the mill is the elevator to replace the old sack hoist which worked off {{the underside of the}} wallower by a friction ring, and the elevator to feed the first floor bin (3rd floor) for the hurst frame. This is a massive timber frame supporting the transfer gearing and heavy <b>mill</b> stones <b>casings,</b> helping to reduce the vibration of the turning mill stones and their wheels (stone nuts). It is a separate structure inside the mill tower thus reducing the transfer of vibrations and noise into the building itself.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{analytical}} model for chatter stability prediction in bull-nose end <b>milling</b> of aero-engine <b>casings</b> {{is presented in}} this paper. And the mechanics and dynamics variations due to the complex cutter and workpiece geometry are considered by analyzing {{the effects of the}} lead angle on the milling process. Firstly, the tool-workpiece engagement region is obtained by using a previously developed method and divided into several disk elements along the tool-axis direction. Secondly, a 3 D dynamic model for stability limit calculation is developed and simplified into a 1 D model in normal direction considering only the dominant mode of the workpiece. Then the cutting force coefficients, the start and exit angles corresponding to each disk element are determined. And the total stability lobe diagram is calculated using an iterative algorithm. Finally, several experimental tests are carried out to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed prediction approach...|$|R

40|$|When a well is {{permanently}} plugged {{and abandoned}} (P&A), a plug {{has to be}} set over the entire {{cross section of the}} well. The conventional method to perform a P&A operation is to <b>mill</b> the <b>casing</b> and pull it to surface before plugging the well, which is a time consuming and expensive method. The perforate, wash and cement (PWC) method is a very interesting technology. It has the possibility to be both faster and more cost effective than a milling operation. Today the main challenge for the PWC technology is the time consumption on the verification of the plug. For a milling operation the cement will always cover the entire plugging area, as this is an open hole. When plugging a well with the PWC technology the cement is forced through small perforations into the annulus or both annuli. Continuous cement in the annulus has to be verified to approve the plug. For a single casing, this can easily be performed by drilling the plug and logging the annulus. The challenge arises when two casings are cemented, because currently there are no technologies available to log through two casings. Reducing the time used on drilling the plug and logging the cement is the key for the PWC technology to become a cost effective P&A method. When operators have set enough successful plugs to rely on the PWC technology, there will be no need to drill out the plug and log the annulus anymore. The verification of the plug can then be performed according to NORSOK D- 010 requirements, which is pressure testing and tagging of the plug. So for now the largest challenge is to verify continuous cement in two annuli, and finding a technology to get a faster and more accurate result when pressure testing the plug. The main scope with this thesis is to give an insight into the PWC technology, discuss the verification challenges, and suggest solutions for future verification methods. It also gives an insight into the regulations and requirements that a P&A operation needs to fulfill. The thesis is divided into four parts; description of NORSOK D- 010 regulations and requirements for a P&A operation, general theory for cementing and verification, the PWC technology, and finally a verification, discussion and conclusion part...|$|R
40|$|On the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) {{there will}} be a wave of subsea and {{platform}} wells that will eventually need to be plugged and abandoned (P&A’d) in a safe and efficient manner. The well abandonment phase is the final stage performed on the well, and it includes the establishment of permanent well barriers to protect the environment. All offshore hydrocarbon (HC) wells will, sooner or later, require permanent P&A in order to control subsurface pressures and prevent the free flow of pore fluids to the seafloor. There is a large diversity of well types to be P&A’d. Some less complex wells can be plugged either by existing rig-less platform equipment, or by a vessel technology. Other more complex wells will need a rig that can handle more challenging and heavy P&A operations, including heavy retrieval of tubing and <b>casing,</b> <b>milling</b> and cement repairs. This thesis will discuss the process of permanently implementing P&A on the subsea wells on the Gjøa field, given that sometime in the future these wells will need to be P&A’d due to declining production. There are currently eleven production wells at the field, and these wells can be categorized based on differences in well design. This thesis also covers an overview of rules and regulations governing P&A activities on the NCS. “P&A of offshore wells represents a significant cost and liability to operating companies and national authorities, {{while at the same time}} being governed by prescriptive downhole requirements. Current requirements are prescriptive as to the number and size of permanent well barriers required, and the requirements are the same for all types of wells” [1]. The main focus of this thesis is on technical solutions that are available today, but it will also discuss the possibility of performing a final P&A job through the use of more time and cost-effective solutions. P&A creates no added value for operators and therefore the operation should be done as quickly and costeffectively as possible. Today's conventional technology is in many ways outdated, and to make P&A economically sustainable in the future there is a great need for new technology and methods...|$|R
40|$|Brookhaven National Laboratory was {{requested}} {{to conduct a}} literature survey for the best available cement {{to use in the}} proposed casing patch as part of the Geothermal Drilling Organization (GDO) project on remediation of deformed casings. A total of 50 wells has been identified with deformed production casing in Unocal's portion of The Geysers geothermal field. Reduced internal diameter and casing doglegs result in lost production and the possible need for abandonment. The cause of the deformations is believed to be formation movement along fault planes and/or along weaker layers or interfaces between high impedance contrast media. Apparently, it is unclear whether shear or axial compression is the dominant failure mechanism. A procedure to address the casing deformation and avoid abandonment of these wells has been developed as described in the Geysers Deformed Casing Remediation Proposal. The proposed remediation procedure involves isolation of the zone of interest with an inflatable packer, <b>milling</b> the deformed <b>casing</b> and cementing a 7 inch diameter liner to extend approximately 100 ft above and 100 ft below the milled zone. During the milling operation {{it is possible that the}} original cement and surrounding formation may slough away. In order to specify a suitable cement formulation for the casing patch it is first necessary to identify and understand the deformation mechanism/s operating in The Geysers field. Subsequently, the required cement mechanical properties to withstand further deformation of the repaired system must be defined. From this information it can be determined whether available cement formulations meet these requirements. In addition to The Geysers, other geothermal fields are at possible risk of casing deformation due to subsidence, seismic activity, lateral and vertical formation movement or other processes. Therefore, the proposed remediation procedure may have applications in other fields. The literature survey focused on published properties for cements used in geothermal and oil well applications and the experiences of well casing deformation occurring in oil and gas fields.

40|$|In the North Sea, {{the average}} field age is {{increasing}} {{and a large}} number of wells needs to be plugged and abandoned in the future. P&A is regarded as an operation with no financial returns and is associated with significantly high costs. With a continuous {{increase in the number of}} wells that require abandonment and a falling oil price, the major focus for the oil industry is reducing costs while ensuring safe and reliable plugging of wells. The conventional method for placing a plug in a cased hole with no external barrier has required section <b>milling</b> of the <b>casing,</b> underreaming the open hole, and placing a balanced cement plug. The conventional method is time-consuming and costly, and is associated with several challenges and risks concerning Health, Safety and Environment (HSE). To reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of P&A operations, more attention has been directed towards the subject of P&A in recent years. This thesis has examined and presented the conventional section milling technology along with its limitations and challenges, and compared it with new technology’s with respect to time and scope. The main focus has been the new perforate, wash and cement (PWC) technology developed by HydraWell, and its advancement in the P&A operation. A case study comparing the conventional section milling operation with the PWC operation has been performed. Other investigated alternatives include reverse/upward section milling and plasma-based milling. This thesis also gives an insight into the process of plugging a well, including regulations and requirements, plugging materials, placement techniques, cement evaluation tools and challenges with the P&A process. The main findings revealed that most of the challenges with the section milling operation can be led back to the generated swarf. The case study revealed that the installation of the reservoir and secondary barrier was the most time-consuming part of the P&A operation. It also revealed that by applying the PCW technology, the operational time used to install the reservoir and secondary barrier could potentially be reduced by 73 % compared to the section milling operation. Considering the impressive scope ahead, the PWC technology has potential to reduce cost significantly for operating companies and national authorities in the future...|$|R
