5|$|In June 1865, {{two months}} after Robert E. Lee's {{surrender}} at Appomattox, General Sherman received his first postwar command, originally called the <b>Military</b> <b>Division</b> of the Mississippi, later the <b>Military</b> <b>Division</b> of the Missouri, which came to comprise the territory between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. Sherman's efforts in that position were focused on protecting the main wagon roads, such as the Oregon, Bozeman and Santa Fe Trails. Tasked with guarding a vast territory with a limited force, Sherman was wary of the multitude of requests by territories and settlements for protection.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} Bourbon Restoration, Louis XVIII {{appointed}} Defrance as inspector general of cavalry. During the Hundred Days, Napoleon's brief return to France, Jean-Marie Defrance commanded {{part of the}} Armée de l'Ouest. This Army of the West was also called the Army of the Vendée and the Army of the Loire. Under overall command of Jean Maximilien Lamarque, one of Napoleon's fiercest supporters, it was formed to suppress potential Royalist insurrection in the Vendée region of France. Defrance {{did not participate in}} the Battle of Rocheserviere, in which Lemarque's army brutally crushed the anticipated Vendéen uprising. He remained instead at his post of the 18th <b>military</b> <b>division,</b> inspecting the cavalry depots in the upper Loire. Defrance retained his rank after the second restoration and commanded the First <b>Military</b> <b>Division</b> in Paris from 1819 to 1822. He also taught at the military school in Rebais.|$|E

Commonwealth citizens who are not subjects of the Queen and foreign nationals may be made Honorary Members.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, {{or perhaps}} because of it, Louis XVIII forced Gazan into {{retirement}} in Grasse, where the aging general dabbled unsuccessfully in politics. After the 1830 revolution, the new King of the French Louis Philippe made Gazan a peer of France, and he received a command of a <b>military</b> <b>division</b> in Marseille. By this time, he was an old man, and in poor health, and he retired in June 1832. Gazan de la Peyriére died in Grasse on 9 April 1845.|$|E

5|$|Blamey {{recommended}} Burston for a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in September 1945, {{along with}} Frank Berryman, James Cannan, John Northcott, Jack Stevens and George Wootten. The recommendation {{was turned down}} by the Labor government as it was not Labor Party policy to award knighthoods at this time. Following {{the election of the}} coalition government in the 1949 election, Blamey wrote to the new Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, again requesting honours for his generals. This time he was successful, and Burston was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (<b>military</b> <b>division)</b> in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Blamey {{recommended}} Savige for a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for the Salamaua {{campaign in}} October 1944. A year later, he recommended Savige for a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath {{for the campaign}} on Bougainville. Both recommendations were turned down by the Labor government. Following {{the election of the}} coalition government in the 1949 election, Blamey wrote to the newly elected Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, requesting honours for his generals. This time he was successful, and Savige was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (<b>Military</b> <b>Division)</b> in the King's Birthday Honours on 8 June 1950. In 1953, he travelled to London to represent Legacy at the coronation of Queen ElizabethII.|$|E

5|$|During the American Civil War, {{he served}} as an advisor to the Engineering Brigade of the Army of the Potomac and became chief {{engineer}} of the defenses of Washington, D.C. Following the conclusion of hostilities, {{he served as}} chief engineer of the <b>Military</b> <b>Division</b> of the Pacific, making him the head engineer for every military construction project on the West Coast. In later years, he persuaded the U.S. government to acquire Pearl Harbor from the Kingdom of Hawaii and supervised numerous irrigation and land reclamation projects in California's central valley. He died on December 15, 1878, in San Francisco, California.|$|E
5|$|As chief {{engineer}} to the <b>Military</b> <b>Division</b> of the Pacific, {{he was the}} top U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officer on the entire American Pacific Coast. Upon his arrival on the West Coast, he visited locations from Alaska to the Mexican border in order to analyze the work that would be needed. Between 1868 and 1870, he surveyed numerous California harbors and made engineering suggestions as required. One of these suggestions resulted {{in the construction of}} a 7,000-foot breakwater that made Long Beach harbor accessible to large amounts of shipping for the first time. In 1870, he suggested that landowners near Colusa, California, construct levees to contain the Sacramento River within a single channel. The plan would reclaim swampland and control the river's annual floods, making large-scale farming possible. The plan was eagerly seized upon by local residents.|$|E
5|$|The Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) is the {{national}} army of Rwanda. Largely composed of former Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) soldiers, it includes the Rwanda Land Force, Rwanda Air Force and specialised units. After the successful conquest {{of the country in}} 1994 {{in the aftermath of the}} Rwandan Genocide, the Rwandan Patriotic Front decided to split the RPF into a political division (which retained the RPF name) and the RDF, a <b>military</b> <b>division</b> which was to serve as the official army of the Rwandan state. Defence spending continues to represent an important share of {{the national}} budget, largely due to continuing security problems along the frontiers with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi and lingering concerns about Uganda's intentions towards its former ally. In 2010, the United Nations released a report accusing the Rwandan army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the First and Second Congo Wars, charges denied by the Rwandan government.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1873, a United States {{military}} commission recommended attempting to obtain Ford Island {{in exchange for}} the tax-free importation of sugar to the U.S. At that time Major General John Schofield, U.S. commander of the <b>military</b> <b>division</b> of the Pacific, and Brevet Brigadier General Burton S. Alexander arrived in Hawaii to ascertain its defensive capabilities. U.S. control of Hawaii was considered vital for the defense of the west coast of the United States, and they were especially interested in Pu'uloa, Pearl Harbor. The sale of one of Hawaii's harbors was proposed by Charles Reed Bishop, a foreigner who had married into the Kamehameha family, had risen in the government to be Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs, and owned a country home near Pu'uloa. He showed the two U.S. officers around the lochs, although his wife, Bernice Pauahi Bishop, privately disapproved of selling Hawaiian lands. As monarch, William Charles Lunalilo, was content to let Bishop run almost all business affairs but the ceding of lands would become unpopular with the native Hawaiians. Many islanders thought that all the islands, rather than just Pearl Harbor, might be lost and opposed any cession of land. By November 1873, Lunalilo canceled negotiations and returned to drinking, against his doctor's advice; his health declined swiftly, and he died on February 3, 1874.|$|E
5|$|General Nansouty {{arrived in}} Paris {{and there he}} {{remained}} during the Bourbon Restoration that followed Napoleon's abdication. He {{was one of the}} first general officers to swear allegiance to the new King of France, Louis XVIII, who would bestow a number of honours upon the General. His gesture encouraged many other generals to also swear allegiance to the new regime. On 12 April 1814, Nansouty was named extraordinary commissioner of the King in the 2nd <b>military</b> <b>division,</b> then, on 20 April, became a member of the commission that was in charge of the dissolution of Napoleon's Imperial Guard. He was given the distinction of Knight of the Order of Saint Louis on 1 June and on 6 July he was called to a command in the Military Household of the King of France, as captain-lieutenant of the 1st company of musketeers (grey musketeers). Despite these positions, Nansouty's financial situation declined severely under the Restoration. The General had had a highly honourable behaviour during the Napoleonic Wars and, unlike some of his fellow Napoleonic Generals, had drawn no revenues from pillaging. He had also been living a lofty and very costly lifestyle, which he considered normal for a nobleman such as himself. Nansouty had been earning a high revenue from his various positions during the Empire and additionally Napoleon was constantly paying high endowments to his best generals. Napoleonic endowments aside, Nansouty's salaries during the first four months of 1814 had brought him no less than 104,000 Francs, but, under the Bourbons, his dignity as Colonel-General of dragoons had been suppressed and transformed into an honorific title of Inspector of dragoons, leaving him with only a 25,000 Francs salary as captain-lieutenant in the King's Military Household.|$|E
