5|$|This {{record of}} disputed {{succession}} {{was by no}} means unique to Northumbria, and the kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex experienced similar troubles during the eighth and ninth centuries. In Wessex, from the death of Centwine in 685 to Egbert's seizure of power in 802, the relationships between successive kings are far from clear and few kings are known to have been close kinsmen of their predecessors or successors. The same <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> of Mercia from the death of Ceolred in 716 until the disappearance of the Mercian kingdom in the late ninth century.|$|E
5|$|Dowding's {{insistence on}} waiting for AI led {{directly}} to his dismissal on 24 November 1940. Many historians and writers, including Bowen, have suggested his dismissal was unwise, and that his identification of AI radar as the only practical solution was ultimately correct. While this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> the cat's eye force did result {{in a number of}} kills during the Blitz, although their effectiveness was limited and quickly overshadowed by the night fighter force. In May 1941 cat's eye fighters claimed 106 kills to the night fighters' 79, but flew twice as many sorties to do so.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how effectively the edict was enforced. Supposedly, inflation, speculation, and monetary instability continued, and a black market arose to trade in goods forced out of official markets. The edict's penalties were applied unevenly across the empire (some scholars believe they were applied only in Diocletian's domains), widely resisted, and eventually dropped, perhaps {{within a year of}} the edict's issue. Lactantius has written of the perverse accompaniments to the edict; of goods withdrawn from the market, of brawls over minute variations in price, of the deaths that came when its provisions were enforced. His account <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> but it seems to modern historians exaggerated and hyperbolic, and the impact of the law is recorded in no other ancient source.|$|E

25|$|While this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> {{trying to}} {{separate}} Haq's actions {{from the larger}} context {{of the war on terrorism}} is tunnel vision at its worst. It is not just hate that motivates such acts, but ideology. One needn't be a bona fide member of an Islamic terrorist group to share their outlook.|$|E
25|$|In this example, simple logic tells {{that there}} is a difference: while the first {{statement}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> it does not assert anything about {{the truth of the matter}} stated. The witness may have told the officer that the truck was blue, but that may not have been the truth; he might have been mistaken or lying.|$|E
25|$|De Hory always {{denied that}} he had ever signed any of his forgeries {{with the name of}} the artist whom he was imitating. This is an {{important}} legal matter, since painting in the style of an artist is not a crime - only signing a painting with another artist's name makes it a forgery. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> as Legros may have signed the paintings with the false names.|$|E

25|$|Probably {{the most}} famous Irishman ever to reside in Mexico is the Wexfordman William Lamport, better known to most Mexicans as Guillén de Lampart, {{precursor}} of the Independence movement {{and author of the}} first proclamation of independence in the New World. His statue stands today in the Crypt of Heroes beneath the Column of Independence in Mexico City. Some authorities claim he was the inspiration for Johnston McCulley's Zorro, though the extent to which this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> is disputed.|$|E
25|$|The {{forces of}} the allied Zaporozhian Cossacks and Crimean Tatars at Zbarazh {{numbered}} around 300,000 – with two thirds of those being Cossacks, and the remaining hundred thousands, the Tatars. Widecki notes {{that the number of}} 70,000 Cossacks given by some sources <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> in so far as it reflects the size of the seasoned, regular Cossack troops, with the remaining 130,000 reflecting the size of the Cossack militia and rebellious peasants. Those forces were commanded by the Cossack leader, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, and Tatar khan İslâm III Giray.|$|E

25|$|According to a {{contemporary}} account written in early 1862, Ward {{and his brother}} arrived in Shanghai, China in 1860 {{for the purpose of}} trading, perhaps as an extension of their father's New York office. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> but given Ward's activities in the 1850s it is almost certain that Ward had ulterior motives for his return. We can be sure he had little respect for the Shanghai business practices, which he dismissed as “lying, swindling and smuggling”. Their arrival coincided with a buildup of Taiping forces in the area.|$|E
25|$|One {{argument}} against {{this is that}} the native life would be more adapted to the conditions there. However, we have experience on Earth that species moved from one continent to another may be able to outcompete the native life adapted to that continent; rabbits introduced to Australia are able to outcompete the marsupials already there. The same <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> for micro-organisms introduced to other planets. Additionally, evolutionary processes on Earth might have explored biological pathways not explored by life on other planets and so be able to out compete it. The same is also possible the other way around for back contamination.|$|E
25|$|Different {{pieces of}} wood cut from a large tree may differ decidedly, {{particularly}} if the tree is big and mature. In some trees, the wood laid on late {{in the life of}} a tree is softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than that produced earlier, but in other trees, the reverse applies. This may or may not correspond to heartwood and sapwood. In a large log the sapwood, because of the time in the life of the tree when it was grown, may be inferior in hardness, strength, and toughness to equally sound heartwood from the same log. In a smaller tree, the reverse <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true.</b>|$|E

25|$|True Orthodoxy {{separated}} from the mainstream communion over issues of ecumenism and calendar reform since the 1920s. The movement rejects the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the Moscow Patriarchate, and those Churches in communion with them, accusing them of heresy and placing themselves under bishops who do the same. They adhere {{to the use of}} the old Julian Calendar since Antiquity, claiming that the calendar reform in 1920s is in contravention of the Ecumenical Councils. True Orthodox writers have argued that in missionary areas such as the United States, Orthodox (SCOBA) membership numbers may be overstated, with the comparative number of True Orthodox as up to 15% of the Orthodox population, in Russia, it has been claimed by some clergy that up to a million Russians <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>True</b> Orthodox of different jurisdictions, though the total number is often cited at 1.7-2 million together.|$|E
25|$|Incompatibilism may occupy any of {{the nine}} {{positions}} except (5), (8) or (3), which last corresponds to soft determinism. Position (1) is hard determinism, and position (2) is libertarianism. The position (1) of hard determinism adds to the table the contention that D implies FW is untrue, and the position (2) of libertarianism adds the contention that FW implies D is untrue. Position (9) may be called hard incompatibilism if one interprets ? as meaning both concepts are of dubious value. Compatibilism itself may occupy {{any of the}} nine positions, that is, there is no logical contradiction between determinism and free will, and either or both <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> or false in principle. However, the most common meaning attached to compatibilism is {{that some form of}} determinism is true and yet we have some form of free will, position (3).|$|E
25|$|Progesterone is well-tolerated {{and many}} {{clinical}} {{studies have reported}} no side effects. Side effects of progesterone may include abdominal cramps, back pain, breast tenderness, constipation, nausea, dizziness, edema, vaginal bleeding, hypotension, fatigue, dysphoria, depression, and irritability. Side effects including drowsiness, sedation, sleepiness, fatigue, sluggishness, reduced , dizziness, lightheadedness, decreased mental acuity, confusion, and cognitive, memory, and/or motor impairment may occur with oral ingestion and/or at high doses of progesterone, and are due to progesterone's neurosteroid metabolites (namely allopregnanolone). The same <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> for side effects of progesterone including dysphoria, depression, anxiety, irritability, and decreased friendliness, and both the adverse cognitive/sedative and emotional side effects of progesterone may be reduced or avoided by parenteral routes of administration such as vaginal or intramuscular injection. Also, some medical professionals may advise patients to take progesterone before bed to avoid these side effects and/or to help with sleep.|$|E

25|$|Destroyed were 40,000 to 50,000 {{archived}} {{digital video}} and film copies chronicling Universal's movie and TV show history, {{dating back to}} the 1920s, including the films Knocked Up and Atonement, the NBC series Law & Order, The Office, and Miami Vice, and CBS's I Love Lucy. Universal president Ron Meyer stated that nothing irreplaceable was lost, meaning everything could be rebuilt again at a price of at least $50 million. Unfortunately while this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> of the archive of video material, the fire also destroyed a huge and irreplaceable archive of analogue audio master tapes belonging to Universal Music, including all of Decca's masters from the 1930s to the 1950s and most of the original Chess masters which included artists such as Otis Redding, Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters. Days after the fire, it was reported that the King Kong attraction would not be rebuilt and would eventually be replaced by a new attraction that had yet to be announced. In August 2008, Universal changed its position and announced plans to rebuild the , basing the new attraction on the 2005 film adaptation.|$|E
25|$|One might further {{hypothesize that}} the {{experimental}} treatment regulates cholesterol, because the treatment seems to selectively regulate genes associated with cholesterol. While this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> {{there are a}} number of reasons why making this a firm conclusion based on enrichment alone represents an unwarranted leap of faith. One previously mentioned issue has to do with the observation that gene regulation may have no direct impact on protein regulation: even if the proteins coded for by these genes do nothing other than make cholesterol, showing that their mRNA is altered does not directly tell us what is happening at the protein level. It is quite possible that the amount of these cholesterol-related proteins remains constant under the experimental conditions. Second, even if protein levels do change, perhaps there is always enough of them around to make cholesterol as fast as it can be possibly made, that is, another protein, not on our list, is the rate determining step in the process of making cholesterol. Finally, proteins typically play many roles, so these genes may be regulated not because of their shared association with making cholesterol but because of a shared role in a completely independent process.|$|E
25|$|The Round Table first {{appears in}} Wace's Roman de Brut, a Norman {{language}} adaptation of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae finished in 1155. Wace says Arthur created the Round Table to prevent quarrels among his barons, {{none of whom}} would accept a lower place than the others. Layamon added to the story when he adapted Wace's work into the Middle English Brut in the early 13th century, saying that the quarrel between Arthur's vassals led to violence at a Yuletide feast. In response a Cornish carpenter built an enormous but easily transportable Round Table to prevent further dispute. Wace claims {{he was not the}} source of the Round Table; both he and Layamon credited it instead to the Bretons. Some scholars have doubted this claim, while others believe it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>true.</b> There is some similarity between the chroniclers' description of the Round Table and a custom recorded in Celtic stories, in which warriors sit in a circle around the king or lead warrior, in some cases feuding over the order of precedence as in Layamon. There is a possibility that Wace, contrary to his own claims, derived Arthur's round table not from any Breton source, but rather from medieval biographies of Charlemagne—notably Einhard's Vita Caroli and Notker the Stammerer's De Carolo Magno—in which the king is said to have possessed a round table decorated with a map of Rome.|$|E
