50|$|The Repartida goat breed from northeastern Brazil is a color type {{selectively}} bred {{from the}} Chué goat. Like its progenitor, it is a <b>meat-type</b> <b>breed.</b>|$|E
40|$|During {{lactation}} the ewe {{is subject}} to intense variations of the metabolic and immune status but the relative studies in sheep are limited, especially in <b>meat-type</b> <b>breed.</b> This investigation aimed at studying the changes of some haematological, biochemical and immunological parameters in Zerasca ewes during this period. The study, that represent a first step of a larger project, was carried out on fifteen adult and clinically healthy Zerasca sheep, an indigenous <b>meat-type</b> <b>breed.</b> The farm was located in Zeri (MS) {{at an altitude of}} 900 meters a. s. l. Two blood samples were collected from the jugular vein using Vacutainer® test tubes; the first within four weeks from lambing and the second two months later. The blood samples were analysed for RBC, WBC, Hgb, MCV, MCH, MCHC, PCV, ALT, AST, BUN, cholesterol, total proteins, glucose, triglycerides, creatinine, NEFA, BPI, cortisol, lysozyme, CD 4 +, and CD 8 +. ANOVA was performed to test the overall significance of the differences between mean values. The postpartum phase resulted in exerting a significant effect upon the following parameters: ALT, cholesterol, glucose, NEFA, creatinine, lymphocyte and lysozyme (P< 0. 001), BUN and CD 8 (P< 0. 05). Among these parameters, some of them exceeded the normal range at the second sampling: ALT, lysozyme and CD 8 +. NEFA decreased below the normal range limit, probably in consequence of the lactation which evidently represents a state of excessive catabolism. Lysozyme level was higher in lactating ewes indicating a momentary enhancement of the innate immunity. It can be noticed that the haematological results showed no alteration and was not influenced by the physiological state. The few available data do not allow to make conclusive assessments but it is possible to assert that no considerable changes in blood count, metabolic and immune systems of Zerasca sheep at this stage were observed...|$|E
50|$|Contrarily, {{sex-linked}} delayed-feathering is very frequent, {{particularly in}} <b>meat-type</b> <b>breeds</b> like Brahma, Cornish, Cochin, Rhode Island Red, Wyandotte, Plymouth Rock and Orpington.|$|R
50|$|Feather {{growth rate}} is {{generally}} slower in K-carriers than in fast normal-feathering birds. But this allele has not {{any effect on}} adult plumage. Sex-linked delayed-feathering is typical in many <b>meat-type</b> <b>breeds.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Yurlov Crower breed was presumably {{created in}} the second half of 19th century by {{crossing}} Chinese <b>meat-type</b> <b>breeds,</b> fighting cocks and landraces, but doubtfully with the direct influence of the Malay breed. According to Moiseyeva (1992), the known breed’s plumage color variants are white, silver, scarlet, black with light yellow, or golden, hackle (most of all), and black.|$|R
50|$|In <b>meat-type</b> <b>breeds,</b> feather sexing {{was not so}} {{extended}} to commercialbroiler production because resulting poorly-feathered males are very prone to scratches in {{the skin of the}} belly, which can descredit carcass quality. After all, unlike egg-laying poultry, meat-type male chicks are not culled, so broiler males can be set apart later, once sexual differences become evident.|$|R
40|$|O presente experimento foi realizado para avaliar o desempenho produtivo de ovelhas deslanadas do Nordeste do Brasil acasaladas com machos de raças especializadas para corte. Dados de 305 parições oriundas de 134 matrizes dentro de três períodos de monta foram usados para determinar as taxas de desmame e sobrevivência das crias, o peso vivo ao desmame e o peso vivo total desmamado por ovelha acasalada. As fêmeas foram acasaladas, em sistema de rodízio de uso dos machos das raças Santa Inês, Hampshire-Down, Ile-de-France, Suffolk e Texel. O peso das crias ao desmame não diferiu entre genótipos. A taxa de desmame foi mais baixa para crias de Suffolk e de Texel, ao passo que crias de Hampshire-Down e Ile-de-France tiveram as taxas de sobrevivência mais baixas. Houve efeito compensatório entre os pesos ao nascer e ao desmame e as taxas de sobrevivência e desmame, de modo que o peso total de cordeiro desmamado não diferiu entre genótipos, à exceção para o grupo F 1 de Hampshire-Down, devido à baixa taxa de sobrevivência dos cordeiros (71, 4 %), se comparado com as crias de Ile-de-France. Os acasalamentos ocorridos durante a estação chuvosa foram responsáveis pela menor produtividade das ovelhas. O desempenho das crias Santa Inês comparou-se ao das raças especializadas para o corte, podendo ser indicada como raça parental em programas de cruzamento com ovelhas deslanadas do Nordeste do Brasil. This {{trial was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate production levels of native breed ewes of Northeast Brazil mated to rams of specialized <b>meat-type</b> <b>breeds.</b> A total of 305 lambings from 134 ewes over three periods of mating {{were used to determine}} weaning rate, survival rate and live weight at weaning and total weight of weaned lamb. The hairsheep ewes were mated in a rotational scheme of the use of rams from Santa Inês, Hampshire-Down, Ile-de-France, Suffolk and Texel breeds. Live weight at weaning did not differ among lamb genotypes. Weaning rate was lower for Suffolk and Texel crossbred lambs. Whereas, the lowest survival rates were observed for Hampshire-Down and Ile-de-France crossbred lambs. There was a compensatory effect among the weight at birth, weaning weight; weaning and survival rate, so that the total weight of weaned lamb did not differ among lamb genotypes except for Hampshire Down crossbred, due to its lower survival rate (71. 4 %) as compared to Ile-de-France crossbred lambs. The mating throughout the rainy season accounted for the decreased levels of productivity of the ewes. The Santa Inês hairsheep lamb performance compared to the other specialized <b>meat-type</b> sheep <b>breeds</b> and could be indicated as ram breed in crossbreeding programs for hairsheep in Northeast Brazil...|$|R
40|$|Two {{relatively}} fecund genotypes (Flemish Milksheep and KU-Lovenaar-an F- 2 cross-bred {{originating from}} pure-bred Suffolk and Flemish Milksheep) and two <b>meat-type</b> <b>breeds</b> (Texel and Suffolk) were compared regarding their plasma inhibin and FSH levels. Oestrus was synchronised by progestagen-impregnated sponges. Blood sampling, starting 12 h after the sponge removal, continued twice daily for 21 consecutive days. To localise the pre-ovulatory LH peak {{and to determine}} the cycle length, sampling at 2 h intervals was carried out during the first 3 days and the last 4 days of the 21 -day period. Immunoreactive inhibin was measured by a 5 - 24 alpha-subunit inhibin assay {{as well as by}} an assay based on an antiserum against native bovine 31 -kDa inhibin (Monash assay). Changes in plasma concentration of immunoreactive FSH and LH during the oestrous cycle agree with the literature data. The profiles generated by the two different inhibin RIAs were different and showed a negative correlation during the periovulatory phase and on days 9 - 11. No characteristic pattern could be observed during the oestrous cycle. Significant breed differences were observed for 5 - 24 alpha-subunit inhibin as well as for inhibin, measured by the Monash assay. The significantly higher (P < 0. 05) 5 - 24 alpha-subunit inhibin and lower inhibin (Monash assay) concentration in Texel ewes resulted in a differential ratio of both inhibin measurements for the Texel in comparison with the other breeds. No significant breed differences for FSH were observed during the oestrous cycle. It is concluded that, although significant breed differences in inhibin concentration are observed, the FSH-inhibin interaction is not the only factor responsible for breed differences in ovulation rate.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to determine the relationship between the growth of chicks and size of eggs, from which they were hatched, in the large <b>meat-type</b> <b>breeds.</b> Prior to incubation, hatching eggs taken from three breeds, White Cornishes, White Rocks, and their crossbreds (F_ 1 s), were classified into six groups based on the individual weight, i. e., 50 - 53, 54 - 57, 58 - 61, 62 - 65, 66 - 69, and above 70 g, and hatched in a single basket. The batteries controlled for the space per bird were assigned at random to each group of the sexed chicks through the test period. The percentage of chick weight involved both sexes at hatching time to the original egg weight averaged 70. 4 % for Cornishes, 72. 2 % for White Rocks, and 73. 8 % for F_ 1 s. Significantly high correlation coefficients above 0. 83 in all the breeds were found between chick weight at hatching time and egg weight. The correlation coefficients in the 2 nd-week of age rapidly declined to about 0. 35, and thereafter these decreased to the level of 0. 1. However, the correlations in White Rocks and F_ 1 s were significant even at the broiler age. The effect of the egg weight to the variances of body weight which were estimated from the formula of ((Σxy) ^ 2 /Σx^ 2) /Σy^ 2 =r^ 2 were 70 % at hatching time, but these abruptly decreased to below 17 % after two weeks of age. Thus, effect of the original egg weight on the chick growth, maternal effect, mostly vanishes at 6 weeks after hatching, but the effect in the F_ 1 s may remain at 10 weeks of age...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} lies in analysing {{the calf}} growth of a selected herd of meat-type cattle raised in a foothills landscape. The period of investigation lasted 5 years (2002 { [...] } 2006). The data obtained for the breeds Charolais and the meat-type Siemental cattle are presented in dependence on the breed, convenience of birth, mother´s height in the cross, calving month and the serial number of the birth. The study covers 795 Charolais calves and 450 calves of <b>meat-type</b> Siemental <b>breed.</b> In the time interval mentioned above, the Charolais breed gave 400 bulls and 395 heifers, the corresponding numbers for the <b>meat-type</b> Siemental <b>breed</b> are 226 bulls and 224 heifers. Considered {{from the viewpoint of}} breed influence on to the calf rate of growth, the investigation has revealed no statistically significant effect. A statistically significant effect has been revealed only for heifers 120 days old, the live weight of the meat-type Siemental heifers being higher (162, 71 kg) than that for the Charolais heifers (158, 14 kg). The differences in the live weight amount to 4, 47 kg. Statistically, this diference is probably significant, the significance level p = 0, 05. Furthermore, the work has studied the effect of calf sex onto the rate of growth in both calf categories mentioned above. The live weight of the meat-type calves show a statistically highly significant difference (p {>} 0, 001) for the bulls and heifers at the age of 120, 210 and 365 days. At the age of 120 days, the live weight of bulls is by 14, 31 kg higher compared with that of heifers, at the age of 210 days the difference amounts to 25, 65 kg and at 365 days 116, 29 kg. Similar differences between bulls and heifers are statistically highly significant also for Charolais calves. At the age of 120 days the bulls are heavier than heifers by 18, 45 kg, at 210 days by 29, 16 kg and at the age of 365 days this difference amounts to 115, 59 kg. The study covers also the investigation of the effect of mother´s cross height on to the rate of calf growth. Considered statistically, no such effect has been revealed for calves 120, 210 and 365 days old. The investigation of the effect of the calving month has brought us to a conclusion that the heaviest calves are born in March and April, with the differences in individual months ranging on significance levels p {>} 0, 001, p {>} 0, 01 and p = 0, 05. In both breeds we have also investigated the effect of the serial number of the birth on to the live weight. For the Charolais breed, the highest weight has been found for calves with serial number 3, 4 and 5. For the calves of the <b>meat-type</b> Siemental <b>breed</b> it has been found that the calves born as the second one reach the highest weight at the age of 120, 210 and 365 days,the results obtained being statistically highly significant (p {>} 0, 001) and probably significant (p = 0, 05) ...|$|R
40|$|Veal calves raised under {{intensive}} {{conditions may}} express non-nutritive oral behaviors. When expressed in an abnormal way, these behaviors {{can be a}} sign of mental suffering and reduced welfare due to a mismatch between environmental or management features and animals' needs. The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of non-nutritive oral behaviors in a large sample of veal farms in Europe and to determine the potential influencing factors present at farm level. Data were collected on 157 commercial veal farms in the 3 main veal-producing countries in Europe (the Netherlands, France, and Italy). Observations of 3 non-nutritive oral behaviors (manipulating substrates, tongue rolling, and manipulating a penmate) were performed when calves were aged 14 wk, and the prevalence of these behaviors was calculated. Information on management practices and characteristics of the building and equipment were collected on all farms to assess potential influencing factors for each of the 3 behaviors. Odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated to evaluate the effect of each individual factor within a generalized linear model. The mean percentage of calves per farm performing manipulating substrates was 11. 0 ± 0. 46 %, performing tongue rolling 2. 8 ± 0. 18 %, and manipulating a penmate 2. 7 ± 0. 09 %, with a high range between farms. Allowing more space for calves than the legal minimum requirement of 1. 8 m 2 /calf and housing them in groups of > 10 calves/pen reduced the incidences of manipulating substrates and tongue rolling. Incidence of manipulating substrates was lower for calves fed maize silage compared with calves fed cereal grain, pellets, or muesli. A higher risk of tongue rolling was found when baby-boxes (i. e., single housing during the first 5 to 8 wk) were not used. Risk of calves manipulating a penmate was higher for calves of milk- or <b>meat-type</b> <b>breeds</b> compared with dual-purpose breeds and for calves fed with 280 to 380 kg compared with those fed > 380 kg of milk powder in total for the fattening period. The study allowed assessment of multiple factors across farms that showed variety in terms of conditions and level of non-nutritive oral behaviors. Identification of the factors influencing non-nutritive oral behavior is helpful to define potential actions that could be taken on farms to improve the welfare of calves and reduce the prevalence of these behaviors...|$|R
