5|$|Four {{different}} types of male flowers exist. On {{the basis of these}} flower types, the genus has often been split into four genera—a <b>more</b> <b>narrowly</b> defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea. The species sometimes referred to Orbignya have coiled anthers, while the other groups have straight ones. The petals of those placed in Maximiliana are much shorter than the stamens, while those placed in Scheelea and a <b>more</b> <b>narrowly</b> defined Attalea have petals that are longer than the stamens. Five species do not fit easily into any of these groups; this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus.|$|E

5|$|The Bill of Rights was {{originally}} proposed to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification. Initially, the First Amendment {{applied only to}} laws enacted by the Congress, {{and many of its}} provisions were interpreted <b>more</b> <b>narrowly</b> than they are today. Beginning with Gitlow v. New York (1925), the Supreme Court applied the First Amendment to states—a process known as incorporation—through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment {{prohibits the}} making of any law {{respecting}} an establishment of religion, impeding {{the free exercise of}} religion, abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on the freedom of the press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances.

5|$|Section116 of the Constitution of Australia precludes the Commonwealth of Australia (i.e., {{the federal}} parliament) from making laws for {{establishing}} any religion, imposing any religious observance, or prohibiting {{the free exercise}} of any religion. Section116 also provides that no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. The product of a compromise in the pre-Federation constitutional conventions, Section116 is based on similar provisions in the United States Constitution. However, Section116 is <b>more</b> <b>narrowly</b> drafted than its US counterpart, and does not preclude the states of Australia from making such laws.|$|E

25|$|In 1876, Stevenson was an {{unsuccessful}} candidate for reelection. The Republican presidential ticket, headed by Rutherford B. Hayes carried his district, and Stevenson was narrowly defeated, getting 49.6 {{percent of the}} vote. In 1878, he ran on both the Democratic and Greenback tickets and won, returning to a House from which one-third of his earlier colleagues had either voluntarily retired or been removed by the voters. In 1880, again a presidential election year, he once <b>more</b> lost <b>narrowly,</b> and he lost again in 1882 in his final race for Congress. He considered a run in 1884, but a redistricting made his district safely Republican.|$|R
5|$|Disagreement {{exists as}} to whether Attalea should be {{considered}} a single genus, or a group of related genera. In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas, Andrew Henderson, Gloria Galeano and Rodrigo Bernal combined all the species in the subtribe Attaleinae (as it was then defined) into a single genus, Attalea. In his 1999 Taxonomic Treatment of Palm Subtribe Attaleinae, American botanist Sidney F. Glassman divided the group into five genera—a <b>more</b> <b>narrowly</b> defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana, Scheelea and Ynesa. Rafäel Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised a single genus in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms, and Jean-Christophe Pintaud continued this usage in his 2008 review of the genus.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to resolve the {{apparent}} differences between morphological and molecularly defined trees, a combined analysis was undertaken which confirmed superorder Liliiflorae as monophyletic, provided that a few modifications were undertaken. These included the removal of two tribes of Melanthiaceae (Melanthiales) and the inclusion of three additional families (Cyclanthaceae, Pandanaceae and Velloziaceae) from other superorders. This newly and <b>more</b> <b>narrowly</b> redefined Lilianae/Liliiflorae contained three orders, Aparagales, Liliales and Dioscoreales (which now included the stemonoids). This analysis also allowed {{for the establishment of}} a single synapomorphy, although this time by the presence of an inferior ovary. Significantly, the authors noted that it was no wonder the authors of angiosperm classifications had been exasperated by the Lilianae.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys couesi and {{at least}} six <b>more</b> <b>narrowly</b> {{distributed}} species with peripheral distributions together form the O.couesi group within the genus Oryzomys. The eighth species of the genus, the marsh rice rat (O.palustris) is {{the only member of}} its own group (unless western populations are classified as a separate species, O.texensis). Oryzomys previously included many other species, which were reclassified in various studies culminating in contributions by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that removed more than forty species from the genus. All are placed in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E

50|$|While {{the first}} {{approach}} is the one which has been most frequently used, the second approach is suitable for countries facing unique challenges that require <b>more</b> in-depth and <b>narrowly</b> defined data or countries who are keen to draft a governance reform that focuses only on a few sectors, {{rather than on the}} whole public administration. This alternative approach has so far been used in Haiti, Madagascar, Mauritania, Senegal, Morocco and Yemen.|$|R

5|$|Since {{these first}} {{landmark}} GWA studies, {{there have been}} two general trends. One has been towards larger and larger sample sizes. At the end of 2011, the largest sample sizes were in the range of 200,000 individuals. The reason is the drive towards reliably detecting risk-SNPs that have smaller odds ratios and lower allele frequency. Another trend has been towards the use of <b>more</b> <b>narrowly</b> defined phenotypes, such as blood lipids, proinsulin or similar biomarkers. These are called intermediate phenotypes, and their analyses may be of value to functional research into biomarkers. A variation of GWAS uses participants that are first-degree relatives of people with a disease. This type of study has been named genome-wide association study by proxy (GWAX).|$|E
5|$|Experts {{disagree}} {{about the number}} of species in the genus Attalea (broadly defined). In 1965, Dutch taxonomist Jan Gerard Wessels Boer estimated that there may be as many as 100 species in the genus. In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas Andrew Henderson and coauthors recognised 29 species in the genus, while Sidney Glassman recognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group. Largely following Glassman's lead, Rafaël Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised 67 species in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms. An important element of this disagreement is the decision by Glassman to define species <b>more</b> <b>narrowly</b> than Henderson. As a result, what Henderson interpreted as variation within species, Glassman took as differences between morphologically similar species. This problem is {{complicated by the fact that}} many of these species are poorly represented in herbarium collections. The large size of the leaves, inflorescences and fruit of many Attalea species makes them difficult to collect. In addition, many important collections, including type specimen, have been lost or destroyed. Sparse or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} attentional spread were studied by having {{subjects}} detect a luminance increment along {{a row of}} evenly spaced dots. The increment could occur for the central, fixated dot (Narrow Attention) or for either the fixation dot {{or one of the}} four dots to its left or right (Broad Attention). Narrow Attention enhanced the detection of luminance increments for the fixated dot, and also enhanced spatial resolution near the fixation dot for judgments of vernier alignment and separation. This indicated that the sensitivity of small spatial filters in the fovea was increased <b>more</b> by <b>narrowly</b> focused than broadly spread attention. Effects of attentional spread on spatial resolution were not obtained for judgments of the separation between two peripherally located targets, perhaps because of their dependence on eccentricity (position) rather than separation. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

These researchers also noted that women reported frequent exposure to social norms of appearance (i.e., considered bombardment by many women), the norms themselves were unrealistic, yet the nature of the messages was that these norms are perfectly attainable with enough time, money, and effort. Men, on the other hand, indicated that they were exposed to flexible social norms of appearance, and therefore report feeling less pressure to attain a particular standard in presenting their appearance to others (Buote et al. 2011).|$|R
