50|$|The term <b>Marconi</b> <b>rig</b> {{was first}} {{applied to the}} tall Bermuda rig used on larger racing yachts, such as the J class used since 1914 for the America's Cup {{international}} yacht races, as - with the many supporting cables required - it reminded observers of Guglielmo Marconi's mast-like wireless antennas (Marconi's first demonstrations in the United States {{took place in the}} autumn of 1899, with the reporting of the America's Cup at New York). Although sometimes treated as interchangeable with Bermuda rig generally, some purists insist that <b>Marconi</b> <b>rig</b> refers only to the very tall Bermuda rig used on yachts like the J-class.|$|E
50|$|A Bermuda rigged sloop with {{exactly one}} jib {{is known as}} a Bermuda sloop, a Marconi sloop, or a <b>Marconi</b> <b>rig.</b> A Bermuda sloop may also be a more {{specific}} type of vessel such as a small sailing ships traditional in Bermuda {{which may or may not}} be Bermuda rigged.|$|E
5000|$|It {{should not}} be {{confused}} with [...] Nat Herreshoff's larger sloops, the Annisquam Fish Class <b>Marconi</b> <b>rigged</b> catboats, nor various motor yachts and surfboards of similar names.|$|R
50|$|S/Y Argo is a two-masted <b>Marconi</b> <b>rigged</b> schooner. She {{is owned}} and {{operated}} by Seamester Study Abroad Programs as one of two sail training vessels the company operates. Argo is certified and inspected by the British Maritime and Coastguard Agency as a Category “0” vessel, allowing her unrestricted operation in the world's oceans. She is registered in Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands.|$|R
5000|$|In 1924 what is {{believed}} to be the first Women’s Championship in the world, certainly in North America, was sailed at the Hull Station of the Boston YC. Teams of 2 women sailed in 14’ <b>Marconi</b> <b>rigged</b> cat boats. The winner received the Hodder Cup, donated by Rear Commodore James R Hodder. By 1928 this cup was retired and Charles F. Adams donated a new cup, the Adams Cup in honor of his mother. The Adams Cup is still awarded today by US Sailing to the top US Women’s Team ...|$|R
50|$|The {{first modern}} sloops were fitted with the Bermuda rig, so called {{as a result}} of its {{development}} in Bermuda, during the 17th century. This rig is also called the <b>Marconi</b> <b>rig</b> because of the resemblance of its tall mast and complex standing rigging to Guglielmo Marconi's wireless (radio) transmission antennas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design is}} said to be based upon the Ian Proctor's Wayfarer with tweaks by Graham Dodd and George Blanchard. [...] Unlike the Wayfarer, the class permits use of a trapeze. The boat uses a {{retractable}} Centerboard. The sail plan consists of a <b>marconi</b> <b>rig</b> with a main, jib, and symmetrical spinnaker.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sail plan}} {{consists}} of a Bermuda rig (also known as a <b>Marconi</b> <b>Rig)</b> with a main, jib, and symmetrical spinnaker. The boat uses a retractable Centreboard. An optional Asymmetrical spinnaker and spinnaker chute is available; also available is a [...] "sail patch" [...] which provides flotation for the mast {{in the event of}} a capsize (and particularly to prevent mast inversion [...] Turtling).|$|E
5000|$|Peacemaker, {{originally}} named Avany, {{was built}} on a riverbank in southern Brazil using traditional methods and tropical hardwoods, and was launched in 1989. The original owner and his family motored in the southern Atlantic Ocean before bringing the ship up through the Caribbean to Savannah, Georgia, where they intended to rig it as a three-masted staysail <b>Marconi</b> <b>rigged</b> motor sailer. The work was never done, however, and {{in the summer of}} 2000, she was purchased by the Twelve Tribes, a religious group with 50 or so communities in North and South America, Europe, and Australia. They spent the next seven years replacing all of the ship’s mechanical and electrical systems and rigging her as a barquentine. The refit vessel set sail {{for the first time in}} the spring of 2007, under the name Peacemaker.|$|R
50|$|A fore-and-aft rig {{having at}} least two masts, with a {{foremast}} that is usually smaller than the other masts. Schooners have traditionally been gaff-rigged and in small craft are generally two-masted, however many have been built with <b>marconi</b> <b>rigs</b> (and even junk rigs) rather than gaffs and in {{the golden age of}} sail, vessels were built with as many as seven masts. One of the easiest types to sail, but performs poorly to windward without gaff topsails. The extra sails and ease of the gaff sails make the rig easier to operate, though not necessarily faster, than a sloop on all points of sail other than up-wind. Schooners were more popular than sloops prior to the upsurge in recreational boating. The better performance of the sloop upwind was outweighed for most sailors by the better performance of the schooner at all other, more comfortable, points of sail. Advances in design and equipment over the last hundred years have diminished the advantages of the schooner rig. Many schooners sailing today are either reproductions or replicas of famous schooners of old.|$|R
50|$|Lehg II was {{designed}} in 1933 by the Argentinian naval architect Manuel M. Campos, and built in 1934 in Argentina. He based it on traditional Norwegian double-ended designs, noting contemporary popular designs by naval architects Bill Atkins and Colin Archer, {{as well as}} traditional Rio de la Plata whaleboats. The beam was 10 feet 9 inches, the depth 5 feet 7 inches. The vessel was constructed from Argentine woods. The <b>rig</b> was <b>Marconi</b> Bermuda <b>rig</b> ketch.|$|R
5000|$|A Bermuda rig, Bermudian rig, or <b>Marconi</b> <b>rig</b> is a {{configuration}} of mast and rigging for {{a type of}} sailboat and is the typical configuration for most modern sailboats. This configuration was developed in Bermuda in the 17th century; the term Marconi was a much later reference to the inventor Guglielmo Marconi whose wireless radio masts resembled the wires that stabilize the mast of a Bermuda rigged ship.|$|E
50|$|In 1912, Nicholson {{introduced}} the 15mR design Istria with a <b>Marconi</b> <b>rig,</b> the first yacht {{in the world}} with a lightweight, laminated wood construction. This led to further developments and growing expertise in the use of lightweight materials which saw its fruition in the use of plywood in deck construction. This ultimately led to arguably Nicholson's most beautiful sailing creation, the 1927 commissioned Vita (later Creole) was built on behalf of Alexander Smith Cochran.|$|E
5000|$|On November 7, 1942, {{after being}} requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration, {{she became a}} member of The United States Coast Guard's Coastal Picket Patrol. She was painted gray and bore the numbers CG 67004. Based at Little Creek, Virginia she patrolled the waters east of the Chesapeake Bay {{entrance}} and south towards Cape Hatteras. She was designed and built as a gaff rigged schooner but during this period was changed to a <b>Marconi</b> <b>rig.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Manureva was {{constructed}} for Eric Tabarly at the shipyard of La Perrière in Lorient (France) in 1968. She {{was the first}} oceangoing multihull racing sailboat, leading to the supremacy in speed {{of this kind of}} boat over monohulls. Unlike the present multihulls, which have flotation compartments or materials in the hulls to make them unsinkable, the Manureva's hulls were constructed from AG4 (aluminium), which is probably the reason why no part of the boat was found afloat after it was lost at sea. Manureva was a cultural and technical revolution: this trimaran <b>rigged</b> as a <b>Marconi</b> ketch (Bermuda <b>rig)</b> was the fastest of her era. Some people even nicknamed her “La pieuvre d’aluminium” (the aluminum octopus). Because she was not painted, she was often described as lacking aesthetics, but this was largely compensated for by her performance. Pen Duick IV was bought by Alain Colas who sailed her to victory in the OSTAR 1972, taking 23 days 20 hours 12 min. After this, he renamed Pen Duick IV to Manureva, meaning “Travel bird” in Tahitian, referring to the albatross, a sea bird which travels very long distances. Alain Colas made some modifications to it, with the aim of circumnavigating the world with stops in several ports along the way. He had concerns that the boat might capsize in the large seas of the southern ocean, so he increased its buoyancy by widening the forward sections of the main hull and floats. In completing his circumnavigation, Alain Colas is well known for being the first sailor to sail solo around the world in a multihull.|$|R
5000|$|Fore-and-aft rig {{features}} flat sails {{that run}} fore and aft. These types of sails are {{the easiest to}} manage, because they often {{do not need to}} be relaid when the ship changes course, as the bottom or [...] "foot" [...] of triangular main sails are on booms which are controlled by sheets (i.e. ropes) which are secured to a midpoint so that they automatically swing to the leeward side of the boat as she tacks [...] Bermuda rig (also known as a <b>Marconi</b> <b>rig)</b> is a type of fore-and-aft rig with a triangular mainsail.|$|E
5000|$|The Butterfly is a one-design sailing dinghy, {{originally}} {{designed for a}} crew of two, but now most commonly raced single-handed. It was designed in 1961 in Libertyville, Illinois by John Barnett. The 12 ft hull is a scow design. The craft has a stayed 18 ft mast set as a <b>Marconi</b> <b>rig</b> with a single mainsail with a 75 sq ft surface area. The cockpit is 15 ½" [...] deep, exceptionally deep for this size of sailboat, and can accommodate an adult up to 6 feet in height.|$|E
5000|$|Thistle hulls are {{relatively}} light for their size; {{they have no}} decking or spray protection, which saves weight. The sail plan is large for a boat of this size, consisting of a <b>marconi</b> <b>rig</b> with a main, jib, and symmetrical spinnaker. The sail plan is larger for the boat’s weight than in many other dinghies, which makes Thistles perform extremely well in light wind. Their hulls have wide, rounded bottoms, allowing the boats to plane in winds as low as 10 knots. It {{is not uncommon to}} see thistles efficiently making their way, while other dinghys of similar design are becalmed.|$|E
5000|$|Oriole has a {{standard}} displacement of 68 LT and a fully loaded displacement of 92 LT. The vessel is 102 ft long overall with {{a beam of}} 19 ft and a draught of 9 ft. The vessel is propelled primarily by 11000 ft2 m2 of sail including the spinnaker in a <b>Marconi</b> <b>rig.</b> The height of the mainmast is 94 ft and the mizzen mast is 55 ft. The vessel is equipped with an auxiliary Cummins diesel engine driving one shaft, creating [...] Oriole has a maximum speed of 8 kn. The vessel has a complement of one officer and five enlisted with the capacity for 18 trainees.|$|E
50|$|Inland Cat is a {{class of}} one- or two-man sailboats, almost {{exclusively}} found on Lake George, Indiana/Michigan. The craft is approximately 14.5 feet in length, with a 4.5 foot beam. The sail is a <b>Marconi</b> <b>rig</b> (aka Bermuda rig), with the mast far forward on the hull, as is the norm for a cat boat. The boat has a retractable galvanized steel centerboard, and a shallow-draft aluminum rudder similar in shape to New England-style cat boats. The design was created by Norm Bell and John Larimore in the mid-1950s and used then-current polyester resin and fiberglass construction techniques. The boat was perhaps over-engineered, and is quite robustly built. Many examples, including hull #2 (the second production boat) continue to race every Saturday during the summer months.|$|E
50|$|In 1922 Judge Charles McKeehan of Philadelphia hired Mower {{to design}} a new boat {{specifically}} to win the Toms River cup. Mower's design became the Mary Ann, a 28 ft hull based on the traditional East Coast catboat lines. In place of the gaff-rigged catboat sail, the first A-cat was soon equipped with a powerful <b>Marconi</b> <b>rig,</b> a tall triangular sail on a 46 ft tall mast and sweeping 28 ft boom at its foot. After Mary Ann swept the race in July 1922, other racers started having their own versions built. The seven-boat fleet became a familiar sight during the 1920s, but the Great Depression {{put a damper on}} the race scene and no more A-cats were built. Mary Ann can still be found on Barnegat Bay.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1900s Charles {{developed}} a new powered craft which would enable the owners to come from their [...] "big-boats" [...] {{before and after the}} competitions. Named the Gelyce class, the name derived from the combined first and last letter of their respective wives: Gertie, Lucy, and Constance.In 1912, Charles introduced the 15-metre-design Istria with a <b>Marconi</b> <b>rig,</b> the first yacht in the world with a lightweight, laminated wood construction. This led to further developments and growing expertise in the use of lightweight materials which saw its fruition in the use of plywood in deck construction. This ultimately led to arguably Nicholson's most beautiful sailing creation, the three-masted schooner Vira (later 'Creole') was built on behalf of the American Alec Cochran, commissioned in 1927. At 63.3 m she is today the world’s largest wooden sailing yacht.|$|E
5000|$|The boat {{design was}} {{commissioned}} by Charles Henry Davis, who received the Hun, {{the first of the}} four boats built. The Witch was the second in the series, and was delivered to Osborne Howes II. (In-laws of Howes purchased the other two.) The Witch was first berthed at the summer house of the Howeses in Yarmouth, Massachusetts, which was called [...] "The Witch House", and used by the family in informal races. She was sold by Howes in 1926, and came into the hands of Edward Barus, who sailed her in the Osterville area. After she was damaged in the New England Hurricane of 1938, she was rerigged from a gaff rig to a <b>Marconi</b> <b>rig.</b> In 1949 the boat, now named Wren, was purchased by Marjorie O'Brien, its present owner, who gave the boat its present name.|$|E
50|$|The Bermuda rig, {{also known}} as a <b>Marconi</b> <b>rig,</b> refers to a {{configuration}} of mast and rigging with a triangular sail set aft of the mast with its headsail raised {{to the top of the}} mast. Its luff runs down the mast and is normally attached to the mast for its entire length. The sail's tack is attached at the base of the mast; its foot controlled by a boom; and its clew attached to the aft end of the boom, which is controlled by its sheet. In many early Bermudian vessels there were no booms, or only the outward corner of the mainsail might be attached to the boom, as is the case with Bermuda Fitted Dinghies. On traditional Bermudian designs, the mast was raked, and a long bowsprit was fitted, to which more than one jib might be fastened. This rig evolved on boats and small ships built in Bermuda throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, and had matured into its more or less modern form by the early 19th century. Although the rig became almost universally used on yachts and small boats during the 20th century, the traditional designs used in Bermuda were too demanding to sail for small or inexperienced crews, and there are few vessels outside of museums that have a traditional Bermudan rig - other than Bermuda Fitted Dinghies.|$|E
5000|$|Bagheera {{was built}} at the Rice Brothers Shipyard in East Boothbay, Maine, in 1924, to a design by John G. Alden, by then already a {{well-known}} designer of sailing ships. Her design is of a class known as Malabar schooners, although she is both longer and wider than most instances of the class. She was built for Marion Eppley, and was originally called Beacon Rock, after her estate in Newport, Rhode Island. Eppley berthed her at Newport, and sold her in 1928 to Robert Benedict. He renamed her Bagheera, and moved her to Chicago, where she embarked on a successful racing career on the Great Lakes, which lasted roughly until 1938. She {{was used as a}} training vessel during World War II, and was shipped to the Mediterranean Sea in the 1950s and sailed back to the United States. In 1948 her gaff rigging was replaced by a <b>Marconi</b> <b>rig.</b> By the 1980s she had been sailed to the west coast, and outfitted for passenger trade. [...] "Bagheera" [...] is now being used as a floating universal classroom for students and professors from Saint Joseph's College's Environmental Science Semester. Weather permitting, the schooner becomes a temporary home and lab, carrying the crew Downeast for two weeks to study climate change and glacial geology, field methods, marine ecology, and oceanography.|$|E
5000|$|Three or more masts, square rigged on all, {{usually with}} stay-sails between masts. The classic ship rig {{originally}} had exactly three masts, but {{four and five}} masted ships were also built. Occasionally the mizzen mast would have a fore-and-aft sail as its course sail, {{but in order to}} qualify as a [...] "fully rigged ship" [...] the vessel would need to have a square-rigged top sail mounted above this (thus distinguishing the fully rigged ship from, say, a barque—see above). The classic sailing warship—the ship of the line—was full rigged in this way, because of high performance on all points of wind. In particular, studding sails or topping sails could be easily added for light airs or high speeds. Square rigs have twice the sail area per mast height compared to triangular sails, and when tuned, more exactly approximate a multiple airfoil, and therefore apply larger forces to the hull. Windage (drag) is more than triangular rigs, which have smaller tip vortices. Therefore, historic ships could not point as far upwind as high performance sloops. However, contemporary marconi rigs (sloops, etc.) were limited in size by the strength of available materials, especially their sails and the running rigging to set them. Ships were not so limited, because their sails were smaller relative to the hull, distributing forces more evenly, over more masts. Therefore, due to their much larger, longer waterline length, ships had much faster hull speeds, and could run down or away from any contemporary sloop or other <b>marconi</b> <b>rig,</b> even if it pointed more upwind. Schooners have a heavier rig and require more ballast than ships, which increases the wetted area and hull friction of a large schooner compared to a ship of the same size. The result is that a ship can run down or away from a schooner of the same hull length. Ships were larger than brigs and brigantines, and faster than barques or barquentines, but required more sailors.|$|E
5000|$|The modern {{yachting}} sloop {{is known}} as the Bermuda sloop, due to its Bermuda rig (also known as the <b>Marconi</b> <b>rig,</b> due to its resemblance to the wireless towers of Guglielmo Marconi), which is the optimal rig for upwind sailing; consequently sloops are popular with sport sailors and yachtsmen, and for racing. The rig is simple in its basic form, yet when tuned properly, it is maneuverable and fast. The main disadvantage is the relatively large size of the sails, especially on larger vessels. It is also less successful sailing downwind; the addition of a spinnaker is necessary for faster downwind speed in all but the strongest winds, and the spinnaker is an intrinsically unstable sail requiring continuous trimming. When sailing downwind, a stable but slower configuration called [...] "wing on wing" [...] in which the main is swung wide, usually to lee while the jib is swung wide to windward will suffice except in racing conditions. However this configuration tends to dip the bow due to leverage applied lower on a jib than on a spinnaker, requiring crew to move aft to counterbalance the dip. The combined forces make the boat ride lower thus being slower due to more hull in contact with water. Also the wing on wing configuration cannot be heeled over to decrease waterline whereas the spinnaker configuration can be. If not tended carefully, the main can go slack {{even to the point of}} being dangerously close to jibing. The jib will have that same tendency and being to windward, will snap sharply a-lee but with no boom and being forward of the mast will make for a far less dangerous move than that of the main. A slack main when to leeward can be brought back under control by hauling on the mainsheet to bring it back in contact with the wind when on the aft quarter to windward but if the wind suddenly comes around onto the aft quarter of what had been to lee, the boat must be brought further a-lee (toward what had windward) to keep the wind strong on the main.|$|E
40|$|The Aerodynamics of sails and sails {{interaction}} problem are of {{high interest}} {{for many decades}} of racing yachts. Soft sails {{have a long history}} for sailing yachts. Rigs have changed over time and regions of the world. The square rig has been used for a long time but was mainly a downwind rig without positive interaction between sails. The Latin rig use triangular sails and has better performances than the square rig in upwind conditions and is more manoeuvrable. The Bermuda or <b>Marconi</b> <b>rig</b> with a mainsail fixed on a mast and a headsail or jib have higher performances in upwind conditions and allows more easy tackle. It is largely used today on racing yachts and is well adapted to a large range of boat size. It is the most known rig configuration for sails interaction. It will be one focus point of this paper. For simplicity, we will not consider the high length boats using multi masts system, as it is a variation on the same theme. Knowing this restriction, it is a complex subject if we think about the slow evolution and the many variations used in a given period of time. This may seems a paradox knowing that racing boats are driven by a unique objective which is speed on sea water in given wind conditions. But as every sailor know, the way to sail fast on water are numerous depending on sea state, wind conditions and boat architecture and is a subject of many contradictory stories. It will be seen how the sail and rig evolution may be related to aerodynamic research and tools evolution over years to help designing advanced sails and rigs for racing sailing yachts. The fact that aeronautic research has frequently played a role of precursor in maritime new findings will be emphasized. 	Interacting sails (mainsail + jib) is a solution, which {{is the result of a}} long evolution over years of practice, and trial and errors on various boats. It has been used for its ability to generate a high driving force without too much heeling force and its consequences leeway and heeling moment. It has been described and explained in a long list of publications. We will go through selected ones to focus on main parameters affecting sail interaction before to go further toward recent evolutions of this classic and largely used rig. 	It will be shown how tools evolution has play a key role in the understanding of the sail interaction problem with Gentry, Marchaj and Milgram publications. 	Later, a well-known evolution has been proposed on Star & Stripes in 1988 with a semi-rigid mainsail. Then, more recently a transition occurs by replacing softs or semi-rigid mainsails by fully rigid ones, as it has been popularized by the famous multi-elements wingsail of the giant BOR 90, and later, by the two last editions of the America’s cup yachts (AC 72, AC 45, AC 48, AC 50). All these evolutions are based on a symmetric rigid mainsail and a classic soft jib or gennaker. The aerodynamic basics and performances of these new configurations will be described from recent publications. Explaining the rational behind this evolution, and anticipate possible future evolution will be proposed. 	Putting this sail design evolution story in perspective, we will show how design tools for sails and rigs have largely contributed to the understanding of sails aerodynamics and to these evolutions from soft to rigid sails. Few figures illustrating these elements are given below and will be completed...|$|E
