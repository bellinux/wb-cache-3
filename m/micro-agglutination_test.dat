40|$|The {{author has}} devised a <b>micro-agglutination</b> <b>test</b> for the sero-diagnosis of Q fever. Preliminary studies had already {{indicated}} that it was highly sensitive, and this has now been confirmed. Using the sera of sheep infected with Q fever, the microscopic slide-agglutination test {{was found to be}} approximately 10 times as sensitive as the capillary agglutination test and the macroscopic tube-agglutination test, and more than 20 times as sensitive as the complement-fixation test. The sensitivity of the test can be still further enhanced by the addition of inactivated bovine serum (“auxi-agglutination”) or by the addition of bovine serum and complement (“conglutination”), but for routine diagnosis or epidemiological studies, the test is sufficiently sensitive without introducing these complications...|$|E

40|$|Leptospirosis {{has been}} {{scarcely}} described in Morocco and is probably underestimated {{in the current}} local medical practices. In October 2010, one patient, 22 years old, was admitted to Mohamed V hospital in El Jadida presenting clinical symptoms assimilable with leptospirosis and hospitalized for biological investigation of leptospirosis markers by serology techniques (Elisa-IgM <b>test</b> and the <b>micro-agglutination</b> reference <b>test)</b> and receiving adequate care and treatment. Seven serogroups of Leptospira have been identified: L. bataviae, L. canicola, L. cynopteri, L. hebdomadis, L. icterohaemorrhagiae, L. patoc (non pathogenic), L. pyrogenes, illustrating a probable wide range of animal reservoir hosts, with predominance of L. icterohaemorrhagiae and L. patoc...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of vaccine mixtures against lactococcosis was tested in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The M 1 strain of Lactococcus garvieae, isolated {{from a recent}} outbreak of lactococcosis at a rainbow trout farm in Turkey, was used in a trial comparing five immuniza- tion treatments: (a) formalin inactivated bacterin (vaccine), (b) the above bacterin together with Freund’s Incomplete Adjuvant (FIA), (c) the bacterin combined with β-glucan, (d) β-glucan only, and (e) phosphate buffered saline-PBS (control). Fish were given intrapritoneal injections and challenged by exposure to the bacteria 30, 75, or 125 days after vaccination. In fish exposed to the bacteria 30 days after injection, the relative percent survival (RPS) was 88. 89 % in the group that received only bacterin and 100 % in the group that received the bacterin combined with FIA. Immunity remained high in the bacterin+FIA group, as the RPS in this group remained 100 % in fish challenged at 75 days, significantly higher than in all other groups. In fish exposed to the bacteria 125 days after vaccination, the RPS was 54. 55 % in fish vaccinated with the bacterin only and 84. 84 % in fish vaccinated with bacterin+FIA. In the group that received only β-glucan, immunity did not improve after vaccination. <b>Micro-agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> of serums showed that immunized fish produced antibodies at high titers within 30 days.

40|$|Background: Tularemia is {{a disease}} caused by a Gram-negative {{coccobacillus}} Francisella tularensis. This bacterium may cause different types of clinical pictures owing to acquisition route and entrance site, such as ulceroglandular, oropharyngeal, glandular, pneumonic, typhoid and ocular forms. Oropharyngeal tularemia (OPT) {{is the most common}} form of tularemia in some regions. OPT may cause tonsillopharyngitis followed by cervical lymphadenopathies (LAPs). Without treatment LAP may persist for several months and may mimic other diseases causing cervical LAPs. Materials and Methods: A total of six cases of OPT, five male and one female, between 21 and 31 years old, diagnosed serologically and clinically recorded in GATA Haydarpasa Training Hospital were included in this study. Detailed story including the region they lived for last 6 months, their occupation, family and neighborhood story with similar complaints were obtained. Patient data were also obtained from manually written patients files and electronical patient file system. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks of all biopsy material were submitted for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study for F. tularensis. Results: A total of six cases with head and neck mass following a story of tonsillopharyngitis admitted to different clinics including infectious diseases, ear-nose-throat and internal medicine in our tertiary care hospital. Physical examination revealed immobile, hard, conglomerated unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy in all cases. Histopathological examination revealed granulomatous inflammation in four cases. Acute suppurative inflammatory changes were also seen in two cases. Large necrotic areas mimicking casseifying necrosis were seen in two cases. PCR amplification of F. tularensis genom from isolated deoxyribonucleic acids was successful in five cases. Conclusion: Tularemia should be kept in mind in patients with tonsillopharyngitis not responding to penicillins and beta lactam antibiotics. Furthermore, persisting LAPs mimicking tumor with or without the story of previously experienced sore throat or tonsillopharyngitis in past few days or weeks should be evaluated for glandular or OPT. At this point, easily applicable serological tests such as tularemia <b>micro-agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> will confirm the diagnosis of OPT. However, if lymph node were already sampled to exclude especially malignancy or T cell lymphoma, tularemia PCR test may be used to make a certain diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of three vaccines was evaluated in chickens {{for the control}} of experimental infection with Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) phage type 4. The vaccines were produced with bacterin, outer membrane proteins (OMP) and fimbriae crude extract (FE). The chickens were vaccinated intramuscularly with two doses of each vaccine at 12 and 15 weeks of age. The chickens were then orally challenged with 10 (9) CFU/chicken Salmonella Enteritidis phage type 4 at 18 weeks of age. Fecal swabs were performed for the recovery of shedding SE, and SE was recovered from the liver and spleen. Additionally, antibody titers were measured in the serum by <b>micro-agglutination</b> <b>test.</b> The {{results indicated that the}} vaccine produced with bacterin yielded better results and resulted in reduction of fecal shedding and organ invasion by SE after oral challenge, although no vaccine was 100 % effective for the control of SE experimental infection...|$|E
40|$|A restrospective {{study of}} the {{influence}} of age on the efficacy of primary immunization against pertussis was done in Tulangan district, Sidoarjo, Surabaya. Five hundreds and seventy children under ten months of age with various vaccination status and 157 children under three years of age as a control group were taken as samples. Adjuvanted "whole-cell pertussis-vaccine", made by Bio Farma, was used in the study. One tenth of finger blood or toe blood were taken by heparinized capillary pipet for the examination of agglutinin titres against pertussis. Serological examination by <b>micro-agglutination</b> <b>test,</b> showed there was no significant differences in the antibody production following administration of 1, 2 and 3 shots of DPT vaccine among chil­dren of 0 - 2 months, 3 - 6 months and 7 - 10 months.

40|$|Leptospirosis {{has been}} so far poorly {{described}} in Cambodia and is probably underdiagnosed in the current local medical practices, although conditions to its active circulation exist in this country. Between June 2006 and July 2007, 612 patients admitted to Takeo hospital and Calmette hospital in Phnom Penh presenting clinical symptoms compatible with leptospirosis, were recruited for biological investigation of leptospirosis markers: PCR detection of bacterial DNA and serology using an Elisa-IgM <b>test</b> and the <b>micro-agglutination</b> reference <b>test</b> (MAT). One hundred eighty-three patients (29. 9 %) {{were found to be}} carrying at least one biological marker of leptospirosis, 88 (14. 4 %) showed an acute infection profile, evidenced by a positive PCR. The proportion of patients with an immune phase profile (15. 5 %) suggests former contacts with Leptospira and possible infections with little or no symptoms. Thirteen serogroups of Leptospira have been identified, with predominance of Panama, Pyrogenes and Australia, illustrating a probable wide range of animal reservoir hosts. Serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae was found in only 4 % of cases, contrasting with usual features of human leptospirosis. No significant link between infection and sex, age or occupation could be established, suggesting a permanent exposure of the population in its daily life rather than the existence of risk groups. This study, the largest conducted to date on leptospirosis in Cambodia, confirms the importance of this zoonotic disease, that must be considered a real public health issue in this country...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In this report, we {{describe}} eight tularemia cases {{who have been}} admitted to emergency department and treated with medical therapy. Material and Methods: Eight patients were admitted to our city hospital January and ndash; May 2012 with the complaints of swelling in the neck, sore throat and fever. Tularemia diagnosis was confirmed with the <b>micro-agglutination</b> <b>test.</b> Results: The median age of eight patients was 58 year and 50 % of them were male. Swollen cervical lymph node (% 100) {{was the most common}} symptom in the tularemia patients. Other symptoms were sore throat, chills, weakness and fever. At physical examination there were lymphadenopathy at 8 patients, tonsillopharyngytis at one patient and fever at one patient. Patients with a diagnosis of tularemia were started antibiotic and surgical drainage were applied to three patients. Possible source of contamination were source water, rural areas and dead animal. Patients have been followed with medical therapy. Conclusion: Tularemia is most common in our country and with early diagnosis and antibacterial therapy complications could be reduced.

40|$|AbstractHaemorrhagic {{septicaemia}} {{caused by}} Pasteurella multocida {{is a major}} epizootic disease in cattle and buffaloes in developing countries with high morbidity and mortality rate. In the present study, a total of 88 P. multocida isolates were isolated from 256 nasopharyngeal swabs and lung tissues samples (34. 4 %) {{during the period from}} January, 2013 to March, 2014 from different governorates located in Egypt. Dead calves showed the highest percentage of P. multocida isolation followed by the emergency slaughtered calves, diseased calves then apparently healthy ones. These isolates were confirmed as P. multocida microscopically, biochemically by traditional tests and by API 20 E commercial kit then by PCR. The percentages of positive serum samples using somatic antigen and <b>micro-agglutination</b> <b>test</b> at 1 / 1280 diluted serum were 10 %, 54. 49 % and 0 % in apparently healthy, diseased and emergency slaughtered samples, respectively whereas, the percentages using capsular antigen and indirect haemagglutination test were 40 %, 60. 89 % and 60 % in apparently healthy, diseased and emergency slaughtered samples, respectively. The ELISA showed the highest sensitivity for diagnosing P. multocida in apparently healthy, diseased and emergency slaughtered animals with percentages of 42 %; 92. 9 % and 80 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to establish the effectiveness of pertussis component of DPT vaccines administered in 2 month infants. Eighty three samples of 2 months infants who were bom in Tresnawati hospital in Yogyakarta during 1989 were given 3 doses of DPT at one month interval. Thirty infants aged 3 months served as control group and received the same vaccine with similar schedule. Blood was taken at birth and after immunization of first, second and third dose of DPT. In control group no sample was obtained at birth. Antibody titer against pertussis was measured by <b>micro-agglutination</b> <b>test.</b> There was no infant who had a protective level of antibody against pertussis prior to immunization. The percentage of protected infants against pertussis after DPT 1, 2, and 3 in the group of 2 months infants were 3. 6 %, 46. 9 % and 90. 4 % compared with 6. 7 %, 56. 7 % and 93. 3 %. There {{was no significant difference in}} effectivity of the vaccine between the 2 groups. The mean titer of agglutinin antibody was still under protective level in study group after DPT 1, and 2, and after DPT 3 was 331. 9 U/ml in the control group. This study suggests that infants at age 2 months are already susceptable to pertussis. Three doses of DPT vaccines with one month interval provide good protection and it is important to avoid drop-out since lesser frequency of vaccination significantly reduced the protective level against this illness. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Dutch {{national}} Brucella abortus {{eradication programme}} for cattle started in 1959. Sporadic cases occurred yearly until 1995; the last infected herd was culled in 1996. In August 1999 the Netherlands was declared officially free of bovine brucellosis by the European Union. Before 1999, the programme {{to monitor the}} official Brucella-free status of bovine herds was primarily based on periodical testing of dairy herds with the milk ring test (MRT) and serological testing of all animals older than I year of age from non-dairy herds, using the <b>micro-agglutination</b> <b>test</b> (MAT) as screening test. In addition, serum samples of cattle that aborted were tested with the MAT. The high number of false positive reactions in both tests and the serum agglutination test (SAT) and complement fixation test (CFT) used for confirmation seemed to result in unnecessary blockade of herds, subsequent testing and slaughter of animals. For this reason, a validation study was performed in which three indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), the CFT and the SAT were compared using a panel of sera from brucellosis-free cattle, sera from experimentally infected cattle, and sera from cattle experimentally infected with bacteria which are known to induce cross-reactive antibodies (Pasteurella, Salmonella, Yersinia, and Escherichia). Moreover, four ELISAs and the MRT were compared using a panel of 1000 bulk milk samples from Brucella-free herds and 12 milk samples from Brucella abortus- infected cattle. It is concluded that the ELISA obtained from ID-Lelystad is the most suitable test to monitor the brucelosis free status of herds because it gives rise to fewer false-positive reactions than the SAT...|$|E

40|$|In 1999, an {{outbreak}} involving 188 patients with Legionnaires' disease (LD) {{occurred at a}} flower show in the Netherlands. This large outbreak provided the opportunity to evaluate serum antibody tests to assay anti-Legionella pneumophila, since limited data {{are available on the}} sensitivity of these tests. The sensitivities of an indirect serotype 1 - 6 immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), a rapid <b>micro-agglutination</b> <b>test</b> (RMAT) IgM serotype 1 antibody assay, and an ELISA to detect IgM and IgG serotype 1 - 7 antibodies, were evaluated using serum samples from LD patients related to the 1999 outbreak. Sensitivity was calculated using positive culture and/or a positive urinary antigen test as the gold standard in outbreak-related patients with radiographically confirmed pneumonia who fulfilled the epidemiological criteria. The IFAT, RMAT and ELISA showed sensitivities of 61, 44 and 64 %, respectively. The sensitivity of the three tests combined was 67 %. In epidemic situations, however, high standing titres may be included in the laboratory evidence of LD cases. In the study population, high standing titres were found in 16 % of cases. If the presence of high standing antibody titres was added to the criteria of a positive test, the sensitivities of IFAT, RMAT and ELISA were 86, 48 and 75 %, respectively. The sensitivity was 91 % for all tests combined. The higher sensitivity for the combined use of tests is offset by a reduction in specificity to 97. 6 %. The results {{of this study indicate that}} using a combination of serologic tests in pneumonia patients suspected to have LD does not substantially improve sensitivity. The results suggest that in the microbiological diagnosis of LD, both IFAT and ELISA are reasonably sensitive assays. In an epidemic situation, both tests are highly sensitive, the IFAT more so than the ELIS...|$|E
