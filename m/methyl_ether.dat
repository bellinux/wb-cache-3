25|$|The simple phenols are not {{the only}} active element in wood-tar creosote. In solution, they {{coagulate}} albumin, which is a water-soluble protein found in meat; so they serve as a preserving agent, but also cause denaturation. Most of the phenols in the creosote are methoxy derivatives—they contain the methoxy group linked to the benzene nucleus (OCH3). The high level of methyl derivates created from the action of heat on wood (also apparent in the methyl alcohol produced through distillation) make wood-tar creosote substantially different from coal-tar creosote. Guaiacol is a <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> of pyrocatechin, while creosol is a <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> of methyl-pyrocatechin, the next homolog of pyrocatechin. Methyl ethers differ from simple phenols in being less hydrophilic, caustic and poisonous.

25|$|Dextromethorphan is the {{dextrorotatory}} enantiomer of levomethorphan, {{which is}} the <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> of levorphanol, both opioid analgesics. It is named according to IUPAC rules as (+)-3-methoxy-17-methyl-9α,13α,14α-morphinan. As its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as an odorless, opalescent white powder. It is freely soluble in chloroform and insoluble in water; the hydrobromide salt is water-soluble up to 1.5g/100 mL at 25°C. Dextromethorphan is commonly available as the monohydrated hydrobromide salt, however some newer extended-release formulations contain dextromethorphan bound to an ion-exchange resin based on polystyrene sulfonic acid. Dextromethorphan's specific rotation in water is +27.6° (20°C, Sodium D-line).|$|E

40|$|A {{computational}} {{study of}} the C(methyl) –O bond activation of fluorinated aryl <b>methyl</b> <b>ethers</b> by a platinum(0) complex Pt(PCyp 3) 2 (Cyp = cyclopentyl) (N. A. Jasim, R. N. Perutz, B. Procacci and A. C. Whitwood, Chem. Commun., 2014, 50, 3914) demonstrates that the reaction proceeds via an SN 2 mechanism. Nucleophilic attack of Pt(0) generates an ion pair consisting of a T-shaped platinum cation with an agostic interaction with a cyclopentyl group and a fluoroaryloxy anion. This ion-pair is converted to a 4 -coordinate Pt(II) product trans-[PtMe(OArF) (PCyp 3) 2]. Structure-reactivity correlations are fully consistent with this mechanism. The Gibbs energy of activation is calculated to be substantially higher for aryl <b>methyl</b> <b>ethers</b> without fluorine substituents and higher still for alkyl <b>methyl</b> <b>ethers.</b> These conclusions are {{in accord with the}} experimental results. Further support was obtained in an experimental {{study of the}} reaction of Pt(PCy 3) 2 with 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrafluoro- 4 -allyloxypyridine yielding the salt of the Pt(η 3 -allyl) cation and the tetrafluoropyridinolate anion [Pt(PCy 3) 2 (η 3 -allyl) ][OC 5 NF 4].

2500|$|IUPAC {{rules are}} often not {{followed}} for simple ethers.

[...] For example, ethyl <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> (CH3OC2H5), diphenylether (C6H5OC6H5). As for other organic compounds, very common ethers acquired names before rules for nomenclature were formalized.

The aromatic ethers include furans. Acetals (α-alkoxy ethers R–CH(–OR)–O–R) are another class of ethers with characteristic properties.|$|E
40|$|Bacteria {{that belong}} to the genus Desulfitobacterium are able to cleave the ether bond of lignin-borne phenyl <b>methyl</b> <b>ethers</b> via O-demethylation of the methoxy moiety. Phenyl <b>methyl</b> <b>ethers</b> occur {{naturally}} in soils and originate from lignin degradation by white rot fungi under aerobic conditions. In order to assess the possible involvement of the anaerobic desulfitobacteria in the network of lignin degradation in soils, {{their participation in the}} O-demethylation of phenyl <b>methyl</b> <b>ethers</b> in the environment was studied. In growth experiments, several Desulfitobacterium spp. were able to O-demethylate the phenyl <b>methyl</b> <b>ethers</b> 4 -hydroxyanisole, syringate, vanillate and isovanillate in the presence of fumarate, nitrate, thiosulfate or Fe(III) as electron acceptor. Only D. metallireducens completely lacked this ability. Up to 18 putative demethylase operons were identified in the genomes of desulfitobacteria. Bacterial enrichment cultures that originated from five different topsoils sampled in the vicinity of Jena (Germany) were used to assess desulfitobacterial O-demethylation in anoxic consortia. Enrichment with syringate and thiosulfate triggered an increase in Desulfitobacterium-specific 16 S rRNA genes in all cultures as confirmed via quantitative PCR. The enrichment was followed by a loss of desulfitobacterial gene copies over time. Community-scale sequencing suggested an outcompetion of desulfitobacteria by acetogens. To allow a better quantification of desulfitobacteria in environmental samples, a new qPCR assay was established that uses the Desulfitobacterium-specific formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (FTHFS) gene as marker. In contrast to the 16 S rRNA gene assay, which detects several gene copies per genome, the new FTHFS assay detects only one gene copy. It is concluded that Desulfitobacterium spp. are involved in the O-demethylation of phenyl <b>methyl</b> <b>ethers</b> in the environment and play an important role within the network of lignin degradation in soils...|$|R
