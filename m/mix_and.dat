5|$|Gold, a siderophile, is most {{commonly}} recovered by dissolving the ores {{in which it}} is found in a cyanide solution. The gold forms a dicyanoaurate(I), for example: 2 Au + H2O +½ O2 + KCN → 2 K + 2 KOH. Zinc is added to the <b>mix</b> <b>and,</b> being more reactive than gold, displaces the gold: 2 + Zn → K2 + 2 Au.

The backstory evolved quickly, and the main conflict centered on the return of the original alien inhabitants.
