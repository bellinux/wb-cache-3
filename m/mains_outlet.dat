50|$|A {{removable}} {{power cord}} is similar but much shorter, {{and is designed}} to connect an appliance to a <b>mains</b> <b>outlet.</b> The female end mates with an appliance inlet.|$|E
50|$|A PCB milling {{system is}} a single machine that can perform all of the {{required}} actions to create a prototype board, {{with the exception of}} inserting vias and through hole plating. Most of these machines require only a standard AC <b>mains</b> <b>outlet</b> and a shop-type vacuum cleaner for operation.|$|E
5000|$|All power <b>mains</b> <b>outlets</b> {{should have}} a wall cover to avoid accidentally {{touching}} the electrified sides between the wall and outlet. This {{is especially important for}} children, as their small fingers can easily reach into this gap along the sides.|$|R
50|$|An AC {{power supply}} {{typically}} takes the voltage from a wall <b>outlet</b> (<b>mains</b> supply) and lowers {{it to the}} desired voltage. Some filtering may take place as well.|$|R
5000|$|The Compaq Portable 386 was a {{computer}} released by Compaq Computer Corporation in 1987. [...] Its street price upon its release was US$12,000-14,000 for a model {{equipped with an}} 20 MHz Intel 80386 CPU, 2 MB RAM, 16 kB ROM, 1.2 MB 5Â¼-inch floppy, 40 or 100 MB hard disk, and a 10" [...] amber colored gas-plasma display. [...] Power is supplied using a <b>mains</b> electricity <b>outlet,</b> a battery exists however just stores the BIOS configuration. [...] Option for Intel 80387 (FPU). An expansion box for two IBM-AT ISA card slots available.|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} space heaters, {{including}} those of oil-filled radiators and natural stone heaters, are plugged into an electric power source, most commonly a <b>mains</b> <b>outlet.</b> The power ratings of appliances are measured in kW, which allows an easy estimation of operation cost per hour, as energy is billed in kWh.|$|E
50|$|The Metrocab is a Zero Emissions Capable taxi {{currently}} {{on trial in}} London. The Metrocab, {{like most of the}} above applications has the core FN powertrain technology. The taxi is driven by two electric motors, with a 1-litre petrol engine used to recharge the battery pack, coupled with an optimised generator. Charging whilst on the go takes as little as 10 minutes, alternative charging can be achieved via any electric <b>mains</b> <b>outlet.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In EV mode, the Golf GTE has an all-electric {{range of}} 50 km. The all-electric mode can be {{activated}} at {{the push of}} a button. Under the New European Driving Cycle, combined fuel economy is [...] equivalent. The electric power can also be saved - for example when driving to a zero-emissions zone. The 8.8 kWh lithium-ion battery can be charged in around {{three and a half hours}} from a domestic <b>mains</b> <b>outlet,</b> or two and a half hours from a domestic wallbox. The battery weighs 120 kg, giving the GTE a total kerbweight of 1,520 kg.The Golf GTE uses a six-speed DSG gearbox with a triple-clutch system specially developed for hybrid vehicles. The electric motor is integrated into the gearbox housing, while further hybrid components include power electronics and a charger. An electro-mechanical brake servo and an electric air conditioning compressor make for energy-efficient braking and air conditioning.|$|E
5000|$|The Compaq Portable III is a PC/AT-compatible {{computer}} {{released by}} Compaq Computer Corporation in 1987. [...] It was advertised as being much smaller and {{lighter than the}} previous portable x86-PCs, however it was still quite large by today's standards. Its street price upon its release was 4999 USD for a model equipped with a 12 MHz Intel 80286, 640 KB RAM, 1.2 MB 5.25" [...] floppy, 20 /40 /60 MB hard disk, and a 10" [...] amber colored gas-plasma display or 5799 USD with the upgraded 40 MB hard disk. [...] There was also an optional ISA Expansion chassis allowed for 2 full length 16-bit ISA add-in cards for 199 USD. [...] Power is supplied using a <b>mains</b> electricity <b>outlet,</b> no battery exists.|$|R
50|$|Located on {{the south}} of the site {{bordering}} Cimitier Street, this small galvanized iron and timber building was used as the gaswork's distribution point. As {{with the rest of the}} southern half of the site, this building is in disrepair with all of its windows broken by vandals. Inside, most of the original machinery is still intact such as 2 miniature Braddock Gasometers which are largely intact and are ornately decorated. The miniature gasometer on the eastern side of the building is connected onto the inlet mains for the main Gasometers on site (from the point it leaves the purifiers in the Horizontal Retort Building), with the second being directly connected to the <b>outlet</b> <b>mains</b> between the Gasometers and the main governor. The main governor is located at the back of the building along with an exhauster and various meters and pressure gauges. The original governor was first installed in 1860 when the gasworks were first built and changed little since then though the building itself has been rebuilt. The governor originally distributed gas into 10 gas mains (2 large and 8 smaller) with the largest 2 just visible on the external surface of the building.|$|R
40|$|Electronically {{monitoring}} {{whether or}} not your car block heater is connected to a <b>mains</b> <b>outlet</b> might at first seem like an arbitrary task. A device installed {{in the comfort of}} the car seating area, which tells the user at every startup {{whether or not}} his/her car is connected to a <b>mains</b> <b>outlet,</b> could have market appeal though. But in order for it to be a worthwhile idea to pursuit, a certain requirement has to be met. It {{has to be able to}} be able to accurately detect whether or not the car is connected, through a single connection; the car ground. A certain part of the voltage in the phase of the mains will be capacitively coupled upon the safety ground. By exploiting the fact that the car ground will be connected to the mains safety ground when the block heater cable is in use, a device which can detect that coupled voltage could possibly be developed. In other words, a cable monitoring unit which in actuality detects a connection to the mains safety ground through capacitive coupling, hence the title of this dissertation. This work sets out to taking appropriate measurements to find out whether or not this proposed method of safety ground detection is valid, with heavy emphasis on whether or not it is applicable to a cable monitoring unit. According to the measurement results, an appropriate device is developed. A device which can fill the function described in the previous paragraph. Development of such a device involves; proper method of supplying power which upholds a galvanically isolated floating ground, signal processing, reliable detection mechanism, and considerations to how unintentional capacitive coupling behaves. A theoretical model of the device is put forth, as well as an actual rough prototype to in practice try to prove that the concept and method is valid. Downsides and problems with the device are discussed, such as upholding an effective detection system without making the device hard and cumbersome to use. Possible solutions to these problems are also proposed. The possible future of the concept of this device is also touched upon...|$|E
