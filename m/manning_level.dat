500|$|Hely became Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 28March 1960, {{taking over}} from the acting AMP, Air Commodore Frank Headlam. Responsible for the Personnel Branch of the RAAF, the {{position}} of AMP occupied {{a seat on the}} Air Board, the service's controlling body that comprised its senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS). The Air Force expanded greatly during Hely's term as AMP, owing to Australia's increasing commitment to the security of South East Asia, and the most significant rearmament program the RAAF had undertaken outside of World WarII. Its permanent establishment increased from a steady 15,000 or so in the 1950s to over 18,000 by 1966. Hely himself initiated a scheme to attract staff from the Royal Air Force, which was suffering cutbacks, by opening a recruitment office in London and taking advantage of the Australian government's assisted passage scheme to import trained personnel and their families. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1964 New Year Honours for his [...] "tactful and careful handling of personnel matters", and for having [...] "done much to improve the <b>manning</b> <b>level</b> of the Air Force". As AMP, Hely put forward proposals {{to increase the number of}} diploma-qualified engineering and equipment officers in the Air Force. He was also closely involved in deliberations concerning the balance of academic and military studies at the RAAF Academy (previously RAAF College), the outcome of which is considered to have left the course biased towards pure science, rather than its applications to air power.|$|E

The squadron received the ﬁrst of 15 PBM-3D Mariner seaplanes on 9 July. Within the week, all of the aircraft were evacuated to NAS Banana River, Florida, to avoid damage from a large storm front entering the area. Training had scarcely recommenced when it became necessary to evacuate half of the aircraft again on 1 August 1944 due to a second hurricane. The seven aircraft returned from NAS New York three days later, and the squadron attempted to restart the disrupted training syllabus. Ground school training was given to all hands, with aircrews receiving antisubmarine warfare, torpedo, mine laying and gunnery training.|$|E
5000|$|During the Civil War, {{there were}} nine new United States regular army {{infantry}} regiments (11th though the 19th) added to the ten already existing. The old regiments (1st through 10th) were single-battalion, ten-company regiments, but the new regiments were authorized three battalions of eight companies each. However, only three of these nine regiments ever reached full strength of three battalions, with four others only achieving a <b>manning</b> <b>level</b> of two full battalions. Regiments were usually commanded by a colonel, assisted by a lieutenant colonel and a major, as well as additional staff officers and enlisted men in the regimental headquarters. Occasionally, a regimental commander would organize several companies into one, or rarely two, temporary organizations, called battalions, under command of the regiment's lieutenant colonel, major, or a senior captain. (An historic example of this arrangement is the 7th Cavalry Regiment during the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876.) ...|$|E

The tank landing ship then {{was placed in}} reserve operating status in December 1967 to be effective until January, 1970. During this reserve period, Wood County operated in a restricted operating status and with a reduced <b>manning</b> <b>level,</b> due to {{the problems associated with}} the ship's main propulsion system, the six Fairbanks Morse diesel engines. While Wood County remained pier side at Little Creek for the greater part of 1969, her crew labored to preserve and maintain the ship and conducted training on board and on shore. The tank landing ship was also used as a demonstration ship for the amphibious school (a stationary training aid) through the summer of 1969. Groups of students from the school came on board periodically to tour the LST-type vessel.|$|E

50|$|The battery {{remained}} the basic artillery unit, although battalion and larger formal groupings of artillery emerged {{later in the}} war in the eastern theater. Four under strength Regular artillery regiments existed in the US Army {{at the start of the}} war and one Regular regiment was added in 1861, for a total of 60 batteries. Nevertheless, most batteries were volunteer organizations. For the first years of the war and part way into the Overland Campaign, a Federal battery usually consisted of six guns and had an authorized strength of 80 to 156 men. A battery of six 12‑pound Napoleons could include 130 horses. If organized as “horse” or fling artillery, cannoneers were provided individual mounts, and more horses than men could be assigned to the battery. After the battle of Spotsylvania in 1864, most of the Army of the Potomac’s artillery was reorganized into four-gun batteries. Their Confederate counterparts, plagued by limited ordnance and available manpower, usually operated throughout the war with a four-gun battery, often with guns of mixed types and calibers. Confederate batteries seldom reached their initially authorized <b>manning</b> <b>level</b> of 80 soldiers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a semi-empirical method {{for the analysis}} of manning policies in firefighting. Since manpower costs account for a major share of non-volunteer fire departments' budgets, <b>manning</b> <b>level</b> {{is one of the most}} important policy issues relating to fire departments faced by local government decision makers. Yet, practically no analytic research of manning levels has been previously carried out. The method described in this paper uses an activity network approach to describe fireground command operations and a structured interview to obtain data. The technique was used to analyze the effect of <b>manning</b> <b>level</b> in one- and two-family residential fires in the city of Calgary, Canada. A series of structured interviews with fire department officers generated data concerning precedence relations among activities, their durations, and their manpower requirements. These were used to establish a relationship between manning levels and time needed to extinguish the fire. The analysis indicated that there is a limit on <b>manning</b> <b>level</b> above which only marginal improvement can be obtained. Also, the effect of an additional firefighter depends on the existing <b>manning</b> <b>level.</b> The results presented here are of a preliminary nature. However, they seem to lend credibility to the technique. In addition, we discuss some qualitative conclusions and other possible uses of the method. government services: fire, networks: applications, policy analysis...|$|E
40|$|Human Systems Integration ReportHuman Systems Integration (HSI) is {{a process}} {{designed}} to reduce life-cycle costs and improve system performance by considering human-related domains. Acquisition specialists lack objective, quantitative research findings {{on which to base}} trade-off analyses. This thesis used eight fiscal years of historical safety (mishaps), manpower (<b>manning</b> <b>levels)</b> and system performance (SORTS) data on the U. S. Navy's Frigates, collected from computer databases of routine reports, to explore relationships in an existing notional model of HSI. Three hypotheses were tested: there is a negative relationship between manning and SORTS levels; there is a negative relationship between manning and mishaps; and there is a positive relationship between mishaps and SORTS levels. No significant relationships were found between SORTS <b>levels</b> and <b>manning</b> or mishaps. When all of the ships were ranked for each month based on percent of total manning and number of reportable mishaps, a positive correlation (Spearman's rho = 0. 4194, p-value = 0. 0294) was found corresponding to a negative relationship between <b>manning</b> <b>levels</b> and mishap rates. More detailed research is needed to isolate the relationship between <b>manning</b> <b>levels</b> and mishap rates from numerous other influences and any noise that may be present in the data set.

A production function is presented to model Marine Corps accessions in the 12 th District using Propensity weighted Qualified Military Available (PQMA) {{and the number of}} recruiters. The recruiting force is allocated according to this nonlinear production function and a "greedy" algorithm to obtain an integer, heuristically optimal allocation. Each recruiting facility's value is determined by its number of recruiters and the PQMA in the county. A 10 % recruiting facility reduction plan is proposed by using an optimal facility allocation model that maximizes the pool of aptitude category I-IIIA potential enlistees. Finally, a determination of the "best" facility <b>manning</b> <b>level</b> is presented as a recruiter assignment decision aid.
