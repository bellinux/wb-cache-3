40|$|Abstract only. Earthworm and annelids were {{incorporated}} in diets for Penaeus monodon juveniles (mean weight 0. 54 g) either in wet or dry form. These protein sources were added in amounts needed to replace 10 % {{of the animal}} source of protein. Other sources of protein in the diet were shrimp head meal, fish meal, and defatted soybean meal. Diets were computed such that two-thirds of total protein came from animal sources and one-third from vegetable sources. Other components of the diet were rice bran, sago palm starch, cod liver oil and a vitamin-mineral mixture. Another diet, used as maintenance diet, served as control. Postlarvae were randomly stocked at 6 individuals/tank in a flowthrough system with 5 replicates/treatment. Each of the oval fiberglass tanks had three 10 -cm diameter PVC pipes for shelter. The prawns were fed 10 % of biomass twice daily. Although treatment means for percent weight gain were not significantly different, the diet that contained dried earthworm or <b>annelid</b> <b>meal</b> gave higher weight gain than diets containing the wet form. The earthworm diet gave higher weight gain than diets containing annelids. Survival rate also followed a similar pattern as that of weight gain. Shrimp fed earthworm (wet or dried) gave survival rates numerically higher than those fed <b>marine</b> <b>annelids.</b> Shrimp fed the control diet had survival rates lower than those fed earthworm-containing diets but higher than those fed the wet annelid diet. In another experiment, earthworm or squid was incorporated in the diet. Survival rates of shrimp with earthworm or squid in the diet {{were significantly higher than}} those fed the control. Weight gains were not significantly different from each other. Food conversion was generally low. The drawback in the use of earthworm, annelids and squid is that they are relatively expensive compared to fish meal and shrimp head meal...|$|R

50|$|Apart from mollusk shells, other shells {{that can}} be found on beaches are those of barnacles, {{horseshoe}} crabs and brachiopods. <b>Marine</b> <b>annelid</b> worms in the family Serpulidae create shells which are tubes made of calcium carbonate cemented onto other surfaces.

30|$|Br {{is known}} to be present in organic {{materials}} of both marine and terrestrial origin in the form of organobromine compounds (Leri et al. 2010). More than 1600 naturally occurring organobromine compounds, such as bromoalkanes, bromopyrroles, and bromophenols have been identified, {{and many of them are}} of marine origin (Gribble 2000). It is known that some microalgae and heterotrophic organisms produce brominated organic compounds (Gribble 1998). Bromoperoxidase enzymes, which catalyze the formation of organobromine compounds, have been found in organisms such as marine algae (red, green, and brown), bacteria, and a <b>marine</b> <b>annelid</b> (Gribble 2000). However, the structures and identities of the organobromine compounds in the deep marine sediments have not been well characterized (Berg and Solomon 2016).|$|R

40|$|SummaryMelatonin, the “hormone of darkness,” {{is a key}} {{regulator}} of vertebrate circadian {{physiology and}} behavior. Despite its ubiquitous presence in Metazoa, the function of melatonin signaling outside vertebrates is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effect of melatonin signaling on circadian swimming behavior in a zooplankton model, the <b>marine</b> <b>annelid</b> Platynereis dumerilii. We find that melatonin is produced in brain photoreceptors with a vertebrate-type opsin-based phototransduction cascade and a light-entrained clock. Melatonin released at night induces rhythmic burst firing of cholinergic neurons that innervate locomotor-ciliated cells. This establishes a nocturnal behavioral state by modulating the length {{and the frequency of}} ciliary arrests. Based on our findings, we propose that melatonin signaling plays a role in the circadian control of ciliary swimming to adjust the vertical position of zooplankton in response to ambient light...|$|R

40|$|Siboglinid worms are a {{group of}} gutless <b>marine</b> <b>annelids</b> which are nutritionally {{dependent}} upon endosymbiotic bacteria. 1, 2 Four major groups of siboglinids are known including vestimentiferans, Osedax spp., frenulates and moniliferans. 3 - 5 Very {{little is known about}} the diversity of bacterial endosymbionts associated with frenulate or monoliferan siboglinids. This lack of knowledge is surprising considering the global distribution of siboglinids; this system is likely among the most common symbioses in the deep sea.

40|$|Cilia-based {{locomotion}} is {{the major}} form of locomotion for microscopic planktonic organisms in the ocean. Given their negative buoyancy, these organisms must control ciliary activity to maintain an appropriate depth. The neuronal bases of depth regulation in ciliary swimmers are unknown. To gain insights into depth regulation we studied ciliary locomotor control in the planktonic larva of the <b>marine</b> <b>annelid,</b> Platynereis. We found several neuropeptides expressed in distinct sensory neurons that innervate locomotor cilia. Neuropeptides altered ciliary beat frequency {{and the rate of}} calcium-evoked ciliary arrests. These changes influenced larval orientation, vertical swimming, and sinking, resulting in upward or downward shifts in the steady-state vertical distribution of larvae. Our findings indicate that Platynereis larvae have depth-regulating peptidergic neurons that directly translate sensory inputs into locomotor output on effector cilia. We propose that the simple circuitry found in these ciliated larvae represents an ancestral state in nervous system evolution...|$|R
5000|$|Annelids' cuticles {{are made}} of {{collagen}} fibers, usually in layers that spiral in alternating directions so that the fibers cross each other. These are secreted by the one-cell deep epidermis (outermost skin layer). A few <b>marine</b> <b>annelids</b> that live in tubes lack cuticles, but their tubes have a similar structure, and mucus-secreting glands in the epidermis protect their skins. Under the epidermis is the dermis, which is made of connective tissue, in other words a combination of cells and non-cellular materials such as collagen. Below this are two layers of muscles, which develop from {{the lining of the}} coelom (body cavity): circular muscles make a segment longer and slimmer when they contract, while under them are longitudinal muscles, usually four distinct strips, [...] whose contractions make the segment shorter and fatter. Some annelids also have oblique internal muscles that connect the underside of the body to each side.|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} {{chordates}} has been debated {{for more than}} a century, with one key issue being the emergence of the notochord. In vertebrates, the notochord develops by convergence and extension of the chordamesoderm, a population of midline cells of unique molecular identity. We identify a population of mesodermal cells in a developing invertebrate, the <b>marine</b> <b>annelid</b> Platynereis dumerilii, that converges and extends toward the midline and expresses a notochord-specific combination of genes. These cells differentiate into a longitudinal muscle, the axochord, that is positioned between central nervous system and axial blood vessel and secretes a strong collagenous extracellular matrix. Ancestral state reconstruction suggests that contractile mesodermal midline cells existed in bilaterian ancestors. We propose that these cells, via vacuolization and stiffening, gave rise to the chordate notochord. D efining the properties and characteristics of the last common ancestor of bilaterian animals, Urbilateria, is a key question of the evolution and development field (1) ...|$|R
500|$|English-language {{writings}} have conventionally treated nemertean as [...] "primitive" [...] acoelomate bilaterians {{that are}} most closely related to flatworms (Platyhelminthes). These pre-cladistics analyses emphasised as shared features: multiciliated (with multiple cilia per cell), glandular epidermis; rod-shaped secretory bodies or rhabdites; frontal glands or organs; protonephridia; and acoelomate body organization. However, multiciliated epidermal cells and epidermal gland cells are also found in Ctenophora, Echiura, Sipuncula, Annelida, Mollusca and other taxa. The rhabdites of nemertea have a different structure from those of flatworms at the microscopic scale. The frontal glands or organs of flatworms vary a lot in structure, and similar structures appear in small <b>marine</b> <b>annelids</b> and entoproct larvae. The protonephridia of nemertea and flatworms are different in structure, and in position – the flame cells of nemertea are usually in {{the walls of the}} fluid vessels and are served by [...] "drains" [...] from which the wastes exit by a small number of tubes through the skin, while the flame cells of flatworms are scattered throughout the body. Rigorous comparisons show no synapomorphies of nemertean and platyhelminth nephridia.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The <b>marine</b> <b>annelid</b> Platynereis dumerilii (Polychaeta, Nereididae) {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a slow-evolving lophotrochozoan that attracts increasing attention as a valuable model for evolutionary and developmental research. Here, we analyzed its immune-related transcriptome. For targeted identification of immune-induced genes we injected bacterial lipopolysaccharide, a commonly used elicitor of innate immune responses, and applied the suppression subtractive hybridization technique that selectively amplifies cDNAs of differentially expressed genes. Results Sequence analysis of 288 cDNAs revealed induced expression of numerous genes whose potential homologues from other animals mediate recognition of infection (e. g. complement receptor CD 35), signaling (e. g. myc and SOCS), or act as effector molecules like ferritins and the bactericidal permeability-increasing protein. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses implicate that immune-related genes identified in P. dumerilii are more related to counterparts from Deuterostomia than are those from Ecdysozoa, similarly as recently described for opsin and intron-rich genes. Conclusion Obtained results may allow for {{a better understanding of}} Platynereis immunity and support the view that P. dumerilii represents a suitable model for analyzing immune responses of Lophotrochozoa. </p...|$|R
