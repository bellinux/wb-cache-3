5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, sea lions gather on both sandy and rocky shores. On warm days, they lie {{closer to the}} water. At night or in cool weather, they travel farther inland or to higher elevations. Non-breeding individuals may gather at marinas, wharves, or even navigational buoys. California sea lions can also live in fresh water for periods of time, such as near Bonneville Dam, nearly 150 miles up the Columbia River. In 2004 a healthy sea lion was found sitting on a road in Merced County, California, almost a hundred miles upstream from the San Francisco Bay and half a <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> San Joaquin River.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Jack Thorpe filed {{a federal}} {{lawsuit against the}} borough of Jim Thorpe, seeking to have his father's remains {{returned}} to his homeland and re-interred near other family members in Oklahoma. Citing the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, Jack was arguing to bring his father's remains to the reservation in Oklahoma, {{where they would be}} buried near those of his father, sisters and brother, a <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> place he was born. He claimed that the agreement between his stepmother and Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, borough officials was made against the wishes of other family members who want him buried in Native American land.

5|$|PFC Fernando Luis Garcia (1929–1952), was {{assigned}} to Company I, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, of the 1st Marine division. On the night of his death, September 5, 1952, he was posted about one <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> enemy lines. The Korean enemies were attacking with grenades, bombs {{and other types of}} artillery. Garcia was critically wounded, but he led his team to a supply point to get hand-grenades. An enemy grenade landed nearby, and Garcia covered with his body, sacrificing himself to save the lives of his fellow Marines. Garcia died instantly. Garcia, whose remains were never recovered, became the first Puerto Rican Medal of Honor recipient.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Corder {{left the}} house, Maria {{set out to}} meet him at the Red Barn which was {{situated}} on Barnfield Hill, about half a <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Martens' cottage. This was the last time that she was seen alive. Corder also disappeared, but later turned up and claimed that Marten was in Ipswich, Great Yarmouth, or some other place nearby, and that he could not yet bring her back as his wife for fear of provoking the anger of his friends and relatives. The pressure on Corder to produce his wife eventually forced him to leave the area. He wrote letters to Marten's family claiming that they were married and living on the Isle of Wight, and he gave various excuses for her lack of communication: she was unwell, she had hurt her hand, or the letter must have been lost.|$|E

5|$|Situated in the Burnden area of Bolton, {{approximately}} one <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{centre of the}} town, the ground served {{as the home of}} the town's football team for 102 years. In its heyday, Burnden Park could hold up to 70,000 supporters but this figure was dramatically reduced during the final 20 years of its life. A section of The Embankment was sold off in 1986 {{to make way for a}} new Normid superstore. At this time, Bolton were in a dire position financially and were struggling in the Football League Third Division, so there was a low demand for tickets and the loss of part of the ground gave the Bolton directors good value for money.|$|E
5|$|St. Seiriol {{established}} a cell {{and a community}} on Puffin Island (in Welsh, Ynys Seiriol or Seiriol's Island) half a <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> coast {{at the same time}} as he founded the monastery. There is a tower of a 12th-century church on Puffin Island still. There is a tradition that St. Seiriol and perhaps Maelgwn Gwynedd (king of Gwynedd in the first half of the 6th century) were buried there. The island once had large numbers of puffins and guillemots. However, rats reduced the bird population to 40 in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|The Portway {{was planned}} by the Bristol Corporation in {{response}} to the decline of Bristol Harbour in the late 19th century in favour of Avonmouth Docks, which could handle larger vessels and containers. Construction started in May 1919, engineered by L.S.McKenzie. The southern section connected to the existing road network at Hotwells, and a portion of the new road near Clifton lay partly on the line of the Bristol Port Railway. The new build did not directly connect to Avonmouth Docks, but linked to the existing road via Shirehampton about half a <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dock gates. The original plan was to build a tramway {{along the length of the}} road, which would have linked Avonmouth to the Bristol Tramway system, but this was abandoned owing to cost.|$|E

5|$|Blacklock {{then went}} to Doncaster, where on 23 September, he started 1/2 {{favourite}} and beat The Duchess to win the Doncaster Stakes over four miles. The same day he also walked over for a sweepstakes of 50 guineas each over the St. Leger course. Twenty-four hours later he beat Rasping to win a sweepstakes of 25 guineas each over four miles., {{and then went on}} to beat The Duchess to win the Doncaster Club Stakes. This was his fourth race in the space of two days. At Richmond in October he won his second Dundas Stakes, this time beating King Corney. Later in the day Blacklock finished last of four runners behind winner Doctor Syntax in the Richmond Cup over four miles. Doctor Syntax had started in the lead, but was overtaken by Blacklock after only 200 yards. Blacklock held the lead until about half a <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> finish, when Doctor Syntax joined him again. Blacklock then swerved out of line, allowing Doctor Syntax to win easily. By the time The Richmond Cup was run Blacklock was apparently unwell and was coughing repeatedly during the race.|$|E
5|$|Dunster Beach, which {{includes}} {{the mouth of the}} River Avill, is located half a <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> village, and used to have a significant harbour, known as Dunster Haven, which was used for the export of wool from Saxon times; however, it was last used in the 17th century and has now disappeared, as new land was laid down among the dykes, meadows and marshes near the shore. During the Second World War, considerable defences were built along the coast as a part of British anti-invasion preparations, though the north coast of Somerset was an unlikely invasion site. Some of the structures remain to this day. Most notable are the pillboxes on the foreshore of Dunster Beach. These are strong buildings made from pebbles taken from the beach and bonded together with concrete. From these, soldiers could have held their ground if the Germans had ever invaded. The beach site has a number of privately owned beach huts (or chalets as some owners call them) along with a small shop, a tennis court and a putting green. The chalets, measuring , can be let out for holidays; some owners live in them all the year round.|$|E

5|$|Force B {{commenced}} its attack {{after the}} Tallboy Lancasters had completed theirs {{so that the}} shock waves from bomb explosions did not prematurely set off the JW mines. As none of the Force B aircrew were able to spot Tirpitz due to the smokescreen, they dropped the mines on the battleship's estimated position. These weapons did not cause any damage. The smokescreen over Kaafjord prevented the Allied aircrew {{from being able to}} assess the results of their bombing, though several large spouts of water and explosions were observed. Tait was also pleased to see a column of black smoke rising through the smokescreen. However, some of the bombs and mines landed up to a <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> battleship. Tirpitzs anti-aircraft guns and a further 98 guns located in nearby shore batteries and warships fired on the bombers throughout the attack. However, only four Lancasters suffered any damage.|$|E
5|$|Half a <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{start of}} the bypass and a short {{distance}} before the arterial makes a turn eastward to traverse Canandaigua Lake to the southeast, US20 and NY5 meet NY21 at a four-way intersection. Like US20 and NY5, NY21 once continued directly into downtown, in this instance via Bristol Street {{to the east of}} the junction, but now follows US20 and NY5 along the east–west leg of the bypass. Past Bristol Street, the bypass widens from two to four lanes and, after meeting two local streets, enters the city of Canandaigua as the limited-access Western Boulevard, albeit with no exits. The route loses this distinction prior to intersecting South Main Street, where US20, NY5 and NY21 meet the southern terminus of NY332. NY21 departs the bypass, following NY332 into downtown, while US20 and NY5 continue onto the four-laned, median separated Eastern Boulevard, the original section of the US20 and NY5 bypass of Canandaigua. The roadway acts a center of commerce for the city, sporting restaurants, hotels, and supermarkets along its length within the city limits.|$|E
5|$|In August 1942 No. 3 Commando was {{involved}} in the ill-fated Operation Jubilee, an exploratory raid on Dieppe in France. The plan called for a frontal assault on the port by the Canadian 2nd Division. Before this would take place, however, Troops from No. 3 and 4 Commandos would land at beaches on the eastern and western flanks and neutralise two German artillery batteries that were covering the main anchorage. No. 3 Commando was assigned the task of attacking the Goebbels Battery, landing on the eastern flank, under Durnford-Slater's command. The battery was located near Berneval-le-Grand, about half a <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea with steep cliffs in front of it. It was decided that No. 3 Commando would land on two beaches to the east and west of the battery, from which gullies rose towards the battery and which would provide concealment while the Commandos approached the battery.|$|E
