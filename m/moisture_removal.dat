50|$|<b>Moisture</b> <b>Removal</b> Efficiency (MRE) is {{a measure}} of the energy {{efficiency}} of any dehumidification process. <b>Moisture</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency is the water vapor removed from air at a defined inlet air temperature and humidity, divided by the total energy consumed by the dehumidification equipment during the same time period, including all fan and pump energy needed to move air and fluids through the system.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to analyze {{physicochemical}} parameters of wastes from A. sisalana by termogravimetry (TG) and spectrophotometric scanning (SC). Wastes exhibited similar chemical profiles, in that picks of bagasse were observed at 669, 307 and 271 nm to bagasse and 671 nm, and those of juice at 307 and 271 nm. The decomposition process involved several events of mass loss, and the first stage, occurred in the temperature range of 36 – 100 °C, was due to volatile compounds, mainly water. The initial <b>moisture</b> <b>removals</b> from the herbal grug and the lyophilized juice were 10. 6 % at 98 °C and 7. 2 % at 96 °C, respectively.

The head rice yield {{values for the}} medium-grain variety at high drying conditions and 1. 5 and 3 % points <b>moisture</b> content <b>removal</b> were even {{significantly higher than the}} corres-ponding values for the long-grain variety at low drying conditions. 1. 5 % points <b>moisture</b> content <b>removal</b> yielded the least damage to the rough rice. Under low drying conditions, tempering had no meaningful effect on head rice yield for all drying durations. For both varieties, using high drying conditions with 6 % points mois-ture content removal at first drying stage associated with 120 min tempering duration could be suggested as a rapid and energy-saving operation to achieve high head rice yield values.

50|$|It {{is useful}} to perform an {{assessment}} of the location and extent of the mold hazard in a structure. Various practices of remediation can be followed to mitigate mold issues in buildings, the most important of which is to reduce <b>moisture</b> levels. <b>Removal</b> of affected materials after the source of moisture has been reduced and/or eliminated may be necessary. Thus, the concept of mold growth, assessment, and remediation is essential in prevention of mold health issues.|$|R
50|$|To {{provide a}} metric that allows {{estimation}} of annual rather than instantaneous dehumidification performance of ventilation dehumidification systems, AHRI Standard 920 further defines a test protocol for measuring a system’s “integrated seasonal <b>moisture</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency”. This metric {{is analogous to}} the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) that is used to compare cooling energy efficiency of competing equipment.|$|E
50|$|Dehumidifying Drying - These {{types of}} dryers {{circulate}} hot and de-humidified dry air onto the resin, suck the air back, dry {{it and then}} pump again in a closed loop operation. This process reduces moisture level in the PET down to 50ppm or lower. The efficiency of <b>moisture</b> <b>removal</b> depends on the air dew point. If the air dew point is not good, then some moisture remains in the chips and cause IV loss during processing.|$|E
50|$|Like the SEER test methodology, AHRI Standard 920 {{requires}} that the dehumidification equipment be tested at several discrete combinations of inlet air temperature and humidity. In the 2015 edition of the standard, four such test conditions are defined. The <b>moisture</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency of the equipment is measured at each of these conditions, and then a proportionality factor is applied to each MRE. The results of those calculations are summed {{to arrive at the}} rated ISMRE of the equipment.|$|E
40|$|The cosorption {{characteristics}} {{of water and}} toluene vapors in various concentrations of triethylene glycol (TEG) solution flowing through a packed-bed dehumidifier are investigated in this paper. A multi-component model was constructed using the reported equilibrium relationships of toluene and water vapors in TEG solutions together with the Krishna-Standart multi-component mass transfer correlation. The effects of liquid-to-air ratios, TEG inlet temperatures, air inlet temperatures were reported on the <b>moisture</b> and toluene <b>removal</b> rate {{as well as the}} <b>moisture</b> and toluene <b>removal</b> efficiency of the packed dehumidifier. Running the packed dehumidifier in a higher liquid-to-gas flow ratio generally increased the removal rates and efficiencies of both water vapor and toluene vapor from the airstream. Inc. reasing inlet temperatures of the TEG solution led to a decrease in the removal rate of water vapor when running the packed dehumidifier at a high liquid-to-gas flow ratio. However, there was no significant change in the toluene vapor removal rate or toluene removal efficiency when the flow rate of the inlet TEG solution was increased.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to assess heat and moisture transport into a domestic refrigerator cabinet during open door conditions, as well as determine sensible and latent refrigerator cabinet loading caused by objects removed and replaced into a refrigerator cabinet. The goal is to know how much water and energy are transported into a refrigerator by these mechanisms. In general, the air inside a refrigerator generally has lower water vapor pressure than the outside surroundings. When the door is opened, water vapor enters the cabinet; this water eventually ends up on the evaporator in the form of frost. In addition to the energy load caused by <b>moisture</b> condensation, <b>removal</b> of the frost requires energy. The analytical and experimental study of heat/mass transfer in an open cavity is of interest not only in refrigerator cabinets, but also in other areas such as solar receivers, buildings, and electrical components.

50|$|As {{the years}} went by, {{applications}} of the interrupted screw design were expanded beyond slippery and slimy materials. This took place because competing continuous screw presses worked best only under conditions of constant feed, at constant consistency. If either the consistency or the flow rate diminished, squeezing would diminish until it was inadequate for proper <b>moisture</b> <b>removal.</b> At the same time, if the consistency increased, the press could jam. To counteract these tendencies {{it was necessary to}} build a very heavy press, frequently with an expensive variable speed drive.|$|E
50|$|The {{authority}} for this definition of <b>moisture</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency is ANSI/AHRI Standard 920, {{published by the}} Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI). AHRI is an association of equipment manufacturers. Standard 920 {{was developed by the}} group of manufacturing members of AHRI that is concerned with energy efficiency of packaged dedicated outdoor air systems (DOAS equipment). The standard provides an objective and quantitative basis for rating and comparing dehumidification performance and energy consumption of equipment that dehumidifies incoming ventilation and makeup air as part of a building’s mechanical systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{infection}} cannot {{easily be}} removed mechanically, although further proliferation of infection {{can be achieved}} by avoidance of <b>moisture.</b> <b>Removal</b> generally involves cutting or shaving of the hair, but chemical treatments may be similarly useful. For women some individuals use a fine comb to remove as much of the infection as possible and then they cut or shave their hair. This is then followed by the application of a sublimate solution in 60% alcohol solution to the scalp. Historical treatments have used alcoholic tinctures of heavy metals, such as mercury bichloride. The application of antifungal shampoos such as pyrithione zinc, formaldehyde and salicylic acid is effective against black piedra. Oral therapy with itraconazole or terbinafine also causes nodules to break down over time. Removal of affected hair and treatment with topical agents is also effective and results in very low recurrences rates.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the computational results from simulations performed on a small-scale cabinet-type forced convective dryer for food product drying. The forced convective dryer is {{designed in the}} form of a drying cabinet, with four trays positioned diagonally to each other within the drying chamber. The trays are designed and simulated as meshed trays to allow better observation of the air-flow and moisture content transport path within the dryer during operation. Air-flow is provided by eight heated-air inlets with four on each of two sides, with two inlets providing heat for each tray. Inlet temperature is kept within the range of food product drying temperature. Boundary conditions of the dryer are also set to simulate the actual dryer such as wall-material and initial conditions. Computational simulations performed on the forced-convective dryer show the air-flow path within the drying chamber in contour plots. Iso-plots of the air-flow magnitude are also shown to illustrate the heated air-flow from the inlets through to the outlet. These plots illustrate the path for <b>moisture</b> content <b>removal</b> from the food product to the outlet. The contour plots also show areas where possible improvement can be implemented. The improvement can also involve alternative boundary conditions, trays positioning and heated-air inlets placement. With the implementation of these improvements a more optimized dryer can be achieved...|$|R

Results {{showed that the}} formed Al-doped TiO 2 nanoparticles were a mixture of anatase and rutile phase and had a size between 10 and 105 [*]nm. The absorption spectra of the nanoparticles shifted towards the visible light regions, depending on the Al 2 O 3 addition. Ti 4 + and Ti 3 + coexisted in the synthesized Al-doped TiO 2; the Ti 3 + concentration, however, increased with increasing Al 2 O 3 addition due to Al/Ti substitution that caused the occurrence of oxygen vacancy. Hg 0 breakthrough tests revealed that the nanoparticles had an appreciable Hg 0 removal under visible-light irradiation. Nevertheless, <b>moisture</b> reduced Hg <b>removal</b> by the nanoparticles, especially when visible-light irradiation was applied, suggesting that the competitive adsorption between H 2 O and Hg species on the active sites of TiO 2 surface occurred...|$|R

The main component of the solid {{desiccant dehumidifier}} included two heat exchangers that were coated with silica gel regular density (RD) type powder {{in order to increase}} water adsorption uptake by improving its heat transfer. A series of experiment were conducted to evaluate two key performance indices, namely, <b>moisture</b> <b>removal</b> capacity and thermal performance, under various operating conditions. Results revealed that the reduction of dehumidification process time by 50 % can lead to significant improvement of the mean humidity ratio at outlet up to 9. 3  g/kg. The maximum <b>moisture</b> <b>removal</b> was found to decrease from 14. 8 to 13. 2  g/kg with higher airflow rates arising from the reduced residence time of the process air. It was further observed that the water <b>moisture</b> <b>removal</b> was highly affected by inlet humidity ratio.

40|$|Predicting the {{performance}} of internally cooled/heated liquid desiccant dehumidification system is complicated, which requires {{a large number of}} iterative calculations. This article numerically developed a quick prediction method for falling film dehumidifiers and regenerators in internally cooled/heated liquid desiccant dehumidification system by non-linear regressions, to predict the mass transfer performance directly with design variables, including inlet parameters of fluids (air, desiccant, and heating/cooling fluid) and system configuration (size, air channel thickness wetting factor, and flow pattern). The LiCl and water were chosen as the solution and cooling/heating fluid. Comparison shows that differences between our results and those by existing mathematical models are acceptable, with an average absolute error of 8. 0 % for dehumidifiers and 5. 2 % for regenerators. The prediction results also appear similar with previous experiment data, showing errors of less than 10 %. The solution temperature has the greatest impact on <b>moisture</b> effectiveness and <b>removal</b> rate of internally cooled/heated liquid desiccant dehumidification system. Air humidity, air flow rate, solution concentration, and solution flow rate also significantly influence the system performance. Considering the limitations of practical projects, two more simplified equations with lower but acceptable accuracy were developed.

40|$|When {{oil sands}} {{tailings}} are deposited in a tailing pond, they settle and segregate {{to create a}} layer of stagnant water on top that is reused in oil extraction and a dense mixture of clay, silt and water on the bottom which {{is referred to as}} mature fine tailings (MFT). Dewatering of MFT is a problem due to its very high fines content and relatively low solid content. Atmospheric drying offers a possible solution to this problem. In this technique, MFT are pumped or dredged out of the pond and mixed with polymers that helps to accelerate the release of water from the fines, and then placed on a sloped drying area in a thin layer. When the released water runs off the remaining flocculated MFT will dry to the desired <b>moisture</b> content for <b>removal</b> and replacement in the mine or for subsequent lifts. This paper presents a laboratory study on the flocculated MFT. With a senes of tests the basic properties and consolidation and desiccation behavior of flocculated MFT are assessed. The results were compared with ohginal untreated MFT, which confirmed that in case flocculants are properly mixed with MFT, they {{have a positive effect on}} the dewatenng rate of the MFT. However, the final exposed to atmospheric drying can be significantly larger than the untreated MFT.

The main component of the solid desiccant dehumidifier includes two heat exchangers that are coated with silica gel RD type powders {{in order to increase}} water adsorption uptake by improving its heat and mass transfer. A series of experiment are conducted to evaluate two key performance indices, namely, <b>moisture</b> <b>removal</b> capacity (MRC) and thermal coefficient performance (COPth), under various hot and humid air conditions. Conventional granular adsorbent packed heat exchangers (GPHX) are employed to benchmark the performance of the adsorbent coated heat exchanger (PCHX).

It is found that the <b>moisture</b> <b>removal</b> capacity increases from 7. 4  g/kg to 11. 0  g/kg with air flow rates of 35  kg/h, resulting in the extended contact time of the water vapor.

Basically, multi-layered fabric technique is used, in which each layer contributes a substantial <b>moisture</b> <b>removal</b> function. The process of <b>moisture</b> <b>removal</b> is greatly affected by the surrounding conditions, such as pressure, temperature and humidity. If these quantities are much higher than the inner microclimate, the <b>moisture</b> <b>removal</b> process is affected, due to reduced hydrostatic pressure. However, the technology of heating in textile systems is widely available but not used as a way of improving and controlling <b>moisture</b> <b>removal.</b> The project main objective is to investigate the feasibility of using heating elements together with knitted spacer structures so as to maintain and transfer moisture by capillary effect in order to be used for moisture management textiles. To achieve this a mathematical model to study the moisture transfer process was created and simulated results based on knitted spacer fabric with a construction of 2 tucks and 2 ends was found to be significant. It showed that application of 4 W heating using a carefully designed Thermoknit knitted elements which was integrated on the inner side of the spacer fabric successfully improved the moisture transfer by 30 % per 11. 5 X 11. 5 cm sample size. This was further studied on the novel, constructed test rig with two mini-chambers that created controlled climatic conditions as experienced when a textile is situated between the inner microclimate and the outside environment.

40|$|Australian product coals are {{becoming}} finer-grained, mainly due to {{improvements in the}} performance of ultra-fine coal recovery methods. The finer the product coal size fraction, the more capacity it has to store water during beneficiation and the higher the pressure required to facilitate dewatering to meet the specified <b>moisture.</b> Following the <b>removal</b> of the pressure applied to facilitate dewatering, the particular product coal size fraction is left under a suction equivalent to that applied pressure, providing it with the potential to re-wet on the stockpile under moist conditions. During the dewatering process, the product coal is unsaturated. The relationship between applied pressure (or the equivalent suction felt on the removal of this pressure) and moisture content for a particular product coal size fraction is described by the Soil Water Characteristic Curve (SWCC) of the material, based on unsaturated soil mechanics principles. Such curves have been obtained for different product coal size fractions, from which the effectiveness of dewatering under a range of applied pressures can be estimated. Moisture content versus time data for ultra-fine and fine product coal samples under a constant applied suction have also been obtained for use in estimating the extent of dewatering achievable for a given residence time in a particular piece of dewatering equipment.

The {{aim of this study}} was to reduce environmental problems associated with agroforestry waste by promoting the innovative use of such waste in the production of activated carbons (ACs) using a low-cost production technique, and ultimately delivering more affordable water and effluent treatment adsorbents. Four varieties of ACs from four different agroforestry materials – pine (Pinus contorta) cones (PC), Abies (Abies cilicica) seeds (AS), maple (Acer ginnala) seeds (MS) and peach (Prunus persica) stones (PS) – were prepared by single-step steam pyrolysis and characterised. The raw materials were evaluated for AC yield while the respective ACs were evaluated on the basis of iodine number, phenol specific area, ash content, pH, <b>moisture</b> content and <b>removal</b> of metal ions, nitrates and sulphates from aqueous solution. The AC yields for PS, PC, AS and MS were found to be 23. 0 %, 18. 0 %, 17. 8 % and 14. 6 %, respectively. The yield for PS (23 %) is within the specified commercial limits of 20 % to 40 %. The phenol specific areas of the ACs ranged between 381 m 2 /g and 415 m 2 /g higher than the commercial lower limit (300 m 2 /g) generally specified. The ACs also showed the capacity to remove heavy metal ions from their aqueous solutions. Removal of both nitrates and sulphates in raw water was greater than 50 %.

We investigated the relationship between total soil CO 2 efflux, soil moisture and soil temperature. Soil CO 2 efflux was measured at each plot using chamber based soil respiration measurements. We determined the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration. The effect of doubled litter was less than the effect of removal. We found that temperature was more influential in the control of soil respiration than soil <b>moisture</b> in litter <b>removal</b> treatments, particularly in the wetter root exclusion treatments (NR and NI) (R 2 : 0. 49 - 0. 61). Soil moisture (R 2 : 0. 18 - 0. 24) and temperature (R 2 : 0. 18 - 0. 20) influenced soil respiration similarly in treatments, where soil was drier (Control, Double Litter, Double Wood). A significantly greater increase in temperature induced higher soil respiration were significantly higher (2 - 2. 5 -fold) in root exclusion treatments, where soil was wetter throughout the year, than in control and litter addition treatments. The highest bacterial and fungal count was at the DL treatment but the differences is not significant compared to the Control. The bacterial number at the No Litter, No Root, No Input treatment was significantly lower at the Control. Similar phenomenon can be observed at the fungal too, but the differences are not significant.

The air revitalization technologies used in these future exploration missions will evolve from current ISS ISS State-of-Art (SOA) and is being designed and tested by the Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) Program's Atmosphere Resource Recovery and Environmental Monitoring (ARREM) project. The ARREM project is working to mature optimum atmosphere revitalization and environmental monitoring system architectures to enable exploration beyond Lower Earth Orbit (LEO). The Air Revitalization Lab at KSC is one of six NASA field centers participating in the ARREM that specializes in adsorbent and catalyst characterization with simulated spacecraft gas streams using combinations of pressure, O 2 partial pressure, CO 2 partial pressure, and humidity that are representative {{of a range of}} anticipated cabin atmospheric conditions and loads. On board ISS, the Trace Contaminant Control Subassembly (TCCS) provides active control of trace contaminants from the cabin atmosphere utilizing physical adsorption, thermal catalytic oxidation, and chemical adsorption processes. High molecular weight contaminants and ammonia (NH 3) are removed a granular activated carbon treated with approx. 10 % by weight phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4) (B-S Type 3032 46 mesh), which is expendable and is periodically refurbished. The Type 3032 granular activated carbon bed is no longer commercially available and therefore it is important to characterize the efficiency and capacity of commercially available NH 3 sorbents. This paper describes the characterization of two Molecular Products LTD activated carbons: Chemsorb 1000 and Chemsorb 1425. Untreated activated carbons (e. g. Chemsorb 1000) remove contaminants by physisorption, which concentrates the contaminant within the pores of the carbon while letting air to pass through the sorbent 4. Low molecular weight or polar gases (e. g. HCl, SO 2, formaldehyde, and NH 3) are not removed by physisorption and typically require chemisorption for removal. Treated activated carbons (e. g. Chemsorb 1425) are impregnated with a a chemical agent (e. g. phosphoric acid) that reacts with those gases, converting them to solids or salts within the carbon and removes them from the air stream. This process occurs via neutralization or catalysis reactions and adsorption capacity is exhaustedwhen the available impregnated chemicals are consumed. <b>Moisture</b> affects <b>removal</b> performance since adsorption sites within the pores are filled with water. The performance of impregnated carbons may be enhanced by moisture content because the mechanisms of contaminant removal are chemical reactions that occur in reagents contained within the pores.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} a {{progress}} report on studies whose objectives are to determine methods of analysis that will rate metal sorption and sulfate reduction activity of organic materials for use in passive treatment systems (PTS). Substrates tested include agricultural residues (alfalfa pellets, sugar beat pulp pellets, brewery waste, corncobs, and walnut hulls), inoculums (dairy manure and wetland inoculum), and a variety woods (maple, oak, pine, poplar, and walnut). Characteristics targeted include moisture, organic and nutrient content; water, ethanol and acid soluble and insoluble fractions and metal sorption capacity. The short-term and long-term effects of organic substrate characteristics on metal removal and sulfate reduction rate are being evaluated in batch and column experiments receiving mine water. These data are not {{presented in this paper}} but will be included in the oral presentation. Measured values of moisture and organic content ranged from 5. 5 to 65 % and 7. 4 to 95 % relative to raw sample weights, respectively. The water-soluble fractions and protein content ranged from 0 to 32 % and 2 to 23 % relative to dried samples, respectively. Low concentration zinc sorption studies were described well by Freundlich isotherms. Using a wider range of concentrations, manganese sorption to substrates was more closely modeled by Langmuir isotherms. The highest manganese sorption was observed for manure, corncobs, walnut hulls and wetland inoculum (8 - 13 mg Mn / gram substrate at an equilibrium concentration (Ce) = 50 mg/L Mn). Corncobs and walnut hulls can be included in substrate specifications to target manganese <b>removal.</b> <b>Moisture</b> and organic content are important parameters in the specification of organic substrates as {{a significant portion of the}} raw organic substrate weight can be inorganic. A high soluble fraction should correlate with a rapid startup of SRB activity and thus is an important element in substrate specification. All substrates have some capacity for metal sorption and their quantification is essential for use in PTS...|$|R
40|$|The USDA Forest Service is {{progressing}} from a {{land management}} strategy oriented around timber extraction towards one oriented around maintaining healthy forested lands. The healthy Forest Initiative promotes {{the idea of}} broadscale forest thinning and fuel treatments as an effective means for mitigating hazardous fuel conditions and, by extension, fire risk. Fuels mitigation is proactive while fire suppression is reactive and expensive. Costs associated with suppressing large wildfires, as occur in the western USA with annual regularity, are astronomical and routinely exceed fire suppression budgets. It {{is not difficult to}} demonstrate that treating forest fuels is more cost effective than suppressing forest fires on untreated lands. In addition, forest thinning is potentially profitable, or at least can recoup the cost of thinning, and may also produce safer conditions for those living in the wildland-urban interface zones. Thinning practices also facilitate wildland firefighting efforts for monitoring and controlling future fire incidents as well as for forest health management practices by state and federal forestry agencies. However, forest thinning and other fuel treatment strategies can take many different forms, some of which can {{do more harm than good}} when considered with other factors that influence wildfire behavior, such as weather and terrain. One example of this issue can be seen in Montana during the 2003 fires. At the Cooney Ridge fire complex, an extensively and homogeneously logged watershed burned severely and uniformly due to remaining ground slash (which had attained low fuel <b>moisture</b> after overstory <b>removal)</b> and severe fire weather (low relative humidity and strong upslope winds). This contrasted with a mosaic of burn severities in an adjacent watershed with higher fuel loads yet greater heterogeneity in fuel distribution at the stand and landscape levels. Harvesting timber does not translate simply into reducing fire risk. Given the stochastic nature of fire weather events, and the complex terrain of most forested landscapes in the western USA, applying a variety of forest thinning and fuel treatment operations towards the goal of maintaining a diverse forest habitat mosaic, also constitutes a sensible fire risk mitigation strategy...|$|R
