40|$|AbstractA {{new set of}} {{relative}} orbit elements (ROEs) is used to derive a new elliptical formation flying model. In-plane and out-of-plane motions can be completely decoupled, which benefits elliptical formation design. The inverse transformation of the state transition matrix is derived to study the relative orbit control strategy. Impulsive feedback control laws are developed for both in-plane and out-of-plane relative motions. Control of in-plane and out-of-plane relative motions can be completely decoupled using the ROE-based feedback control law. A tangential impulsive control method is proposed to study the relationship of fuel consumption and <b>maneuvering</b> <b>positions.</b> An optimal analytical along-track impulsive control strategy is then derived. Different typical orbit maneuvers, including formation establishment, reconfiguration, long-distance maneuvers, and formation keeping, are taken as examples to demonstrate {{the performance of the}} proposed control laws. The effects {{of relative}} measurement errors are also considered to validate the high accuracy of the proposed control method...|$|E

40|$|Combined {{arms are}} the {{appropriate}} combinations to achieve mutually complementary effects {{in real time}} strategy (RTS) game. However, it remains the difficulty of planning the sub-unit <b>maneuver,</b> <b>positioning</b> and engagement. Following the research of multi-agents potential fields that provides an effective and efficient way to handle unit maneuver in various environment, we adopted fuzzy measure and integral into potential field and extended the normal additive property to non-additive property in potential field. A new approach for various maneuver planning in RTS game is proposed. The model explains the basic principles that must guide the combined arms in the movement and conduct human-like unit maneuver. We implemented our methodology in a well-known RTS game platform, Warcraft III. In our experiment, fuzzy measure and integral showed the ability to perform various and human-like intelligence in game. Department of Computin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} recent {{results on}} the design and simulation of a flight control strategy for the Micromechanical Flying Insect (MFI), a 10 - 25 mm (wingtipto-wingtip) device capable of sustained autonomous flight. Biologically inspired by the real insect’s flight <b>maneuver,</b> <b>position</b> control is achieved via attitude control. The wings motion is parameterized by a small set of parameters which are sufficient to generate desired average torques to regulate its attitude. Position control is achieved through attitude control based on the linearized dynamics under small angle assumption near hovering. At {{the end of each}} wingbeat, the controller schedules the desired wings motion parameters according to state feedback errors. With respect to our previous work (Deng et al., 2001), we explicitly included the modeling approximations into the design of the flight controller. These errors include the timevarying nature of aerodynamic forces, the input saturation and linearization errors. The proposed controller was simulated with the Virtual Insect Flight Simulator, and the results show improved performance in both position and orientation stabilization...|$|R

[...] By this time, Steele's division had finally <b>maneuvered</b> into <b>position</b> on Sherman's right, and at 4 p.m., Steele {{gave the order}} to charge against the 26th Louisiana Redoubt.
