The study selected regions among the Goseong-gun waters including {{a high level}} of <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> diversity, and 4 sessions were conducted between March and September of 2010. As a result, 154 species of 68 families of <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> were observed, and the figure also included 11 unrecorded Korean species. The 154 <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> species observed in this study was added to the 188 species which were recorded in taxa encyclopedia to have been collected in Goseong-gun, thereby leading to 311 species of 99 families of <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> (polychaetes, amphipods, decapods and molluscs) living in Goseong-gun {{to be included in the}} inventory created...|$|R

40|$|Diversity and {{abundance}} of <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> are crucial component {{in making sure}} the health of reef ecosystem. Nevertheless, some of these <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> pose some dangers to humans {{as well as the}} coral community. Besides that, some invertebrates are also enjoyed as delicacies for consumption. Research of diversity {{and abundance}} of <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> including hazardous and edible species were conducted at Sepangar Island involving four locations and three depths for each location. Data was collected using invertebrate belt transect with length of 100 m and width of 5 m. A total of 19 species of <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> were identified throughout the study. Highest diversity was obtained at Site 4 (15 species) and highest abundance of <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> was obtained at Site 3 (66 ind/ 1000 m 2). Depth of 5 m and 10 m had the same diversity (12 species); however abundance of <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> was the highest at 5 m (62 ind/ 1000 m 2). Out of 19 species, three species were classified as hazardous and seven species were considered edible. Moreover, abundance of hazardous and edible <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> was highest at Site 3 and at 5 m of depth. Statistical analysis showed that depths influenced the diversity and abundance of <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> including hazardous and edible species, while locations did not affect the diversity and abundance at all...|$|R

These edible <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> are sources of potent bioactive peptides. The {{last two decades}} have seen a surge {{of interest in the}} discovery of antioxidant peptides from edible <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> Enzymatic hydrolysis is an efficient strategy commonly used for releasing antioxidant peptides from food proteins. A growing number of antioxidant peptide sequences have been identified from the enzymatic hydrolysates of edible <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> Antioxidant peptides have potential applications in food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. In this review, we first give a brief overview of the current state of progress of antioxidant peptide research, with special attention to marine antioxidant peptides. We then focus on 22 investigations which identified 32 antioxidant peptides from enzymatic hydrolysates of edible <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> Strategies adopted by various research groups in the purification and identification of the antioxidant peptides will be summarized. Structural characteristic of the peptide sequences in relation to their antioxidant activities will be reviewed.

40|$|Patterns of {{longevity}} {{and rate of}} appearance of taxa in the fossil record indicate a different evolutionary dynamic between land plants and <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> Among <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates,</b> rates of taxonomic turnover declined through the Phanerozoic, with increasingly extinction-resistant, long-lived, clades coming to dominate. Among terrestrial vascular plants, rates of turnover increased through the Phanerozoic, with short-lived, extinction-prone clades coming to dominate from the Devonian to the present. Terrestrial vertebrates appear to approximate the <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> pattern more closely than the plant record. We identify two features which individually or jointly may have influenced this distinction. First, land plants continuously invaded stressful environments during their evolution, while <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> and terrestrial vertebrates did not. Second, the relative structural simplicity and indeterminate mode of plant growth vs. the relative structural complexity and determinate mode of animal growth may have influenced the timing of major clade origin in the two groups...|$|R

40|$|Investment in {{reproduction}} {{ranges from}} gamete production to active parental care, and <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> span this range. However, {{the cost of}} parental care {{has not yet been}} systematically quantified, nor incorporated into life history studies of <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates,</b> in contrast to most other animal taxa. Since oxygen is a limiting factor in egg masses of <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates,</b> we studied patterns of oxygen partial pressure over time in embryo masses of Brachyuran crabs, and correlated these results with the cost of providing oxygen to the embryos. We found that: (1) oxygen is limiting in the embryo masses, (2) female crabs show an active brooding behaviour that we think helps to provide oxygen to the embryo mass, and (3) there is a substantial parental investment associated with brooding behaviours. Oxygen limitation and parental investment seem to be associated in many taxa of <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates,</b> and we suggest that oxygen provision to the embryos may be a critical factor determining parental investment in this group...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{literature review}} {{was conducted to}} determine the species richness of all the possible taxa of free-living benthic <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> in Chile. In addition, the extent of endemism to the Pacific Islands and deep-sea, the number of non-indigenous species, and the contribution that the Chilean benthic <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> fauna makes to the world benthic <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> fauna was examined. A total of 4, 553 species were found. The most speciose taxa were the Crustacea, Mollusca and Polychaeta. Species richness data was not available {{for a number of}} taxa, despite evidence that these taxa are present in the Chilean benthos. The Chilean <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> benthic fauna constitutes 2. 47 % of the world <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> benthic fauna. There are 599 species endemic to the Pacific Islands and 205 in the deep-sea. There are 25 invasive or non-indigenous species so far identified in Chile. Though the Chilean fauna is speciose there is still a considerable amount of diversity yet to be described, particularly amongst the small bodied invertebrates and from the less well explored habitats, such as the deep-sea.

The definitive {{version of}} this article is available at [URL] is not as common in the <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> fauna of the Galapagos Islands region as in the adjacent terrestrial biota. <b>Marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> in the Galapagos are largely cosmopolitan species from the Panamic, Indo-Pacific, Californian, or Peruvian faunal provinces. However, an endemic component is also present in the fauna. The observed pattern among <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> organisms can be accounted for by at least two processes: (1) genetic continuity between mainland and island populations mediated through planktonic larvae; and (2) lower rates of intrinsic evolutionary change. The evolutionary scenario standardly applied to terrestrial organisms in the Galapagos, namely, adaptive radiation and speciation in reproductive isolation from mainland source populations, does not apply to all <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> Evidence in support of the alternative scenario for <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> comes from both published records of species occurring in the islands and recent studies of fossil-bearing deposits on several islands in the archipelago. Two misconceptions-considering the islands and sedimentary deposits to be older than now thought, and equating the rate of evolution of the terrestrial biota with the marine biota-can lead to an incorrect interpretation of evolution in the Galapagos. Contrasts between <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> and terrestrial organisms serve to illustrate some fundamental differences which have important evolutionary implications. Some of these are: endemism; dispersal; taxonomic relationships; island definitions; rates of evolutionary change; and age of fossils. In terms of Darwin's evolutionary scenario, terrestrial organisms represent the paradigm and marine organisms represent the paradox...|$|R
