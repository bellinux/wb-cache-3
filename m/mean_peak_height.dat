40|$|Purpose: To {{define the}} role of {{magnetization}} transfer imaging (MTI) in detecting subclinical central nervous system (CNS) lesions in primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS). Materials and Methods: Ten non-CNS PAPS patients were compared to 10 CNS PAPS patients and 10 age- and sex-matched controls. All PAPS patients met Sapporo criteria. All Subjects underwent conventional MRI and complementary MTI analysis to compose histograms. CNS viability was determined according to the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) by mean pixel intensity (MPI) and the <b>mean</b> <b>peak</b> <b>height</b> (MPH). Volumetric cerebral measurements were assessed by brain parenchyma factor (BPF) and total/cerebral volume. Results: MTR histograms analysis revealed that MPI was significantly different among groups (P 0. 05) and higher than CNS PAPS (4. 71 +/- 0. 30 % (1 /pu), P 0. 05). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that non-CNS PAPS patients have subclinical cerebral damage. The long-term-clinical relevance of MTI analysis in these patients needs to be defined by prospective studies...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} white-matter (WM) diffusion anisotropy in medulloblastoma survivors after cranial irradiation and chemotherapy using voxel-based analysis with SPM 99 and fractional anisotropy (FA) histogram-derived indices, and to identify quantitative indices for detecting and monitoring children with treatment-induced white-matter injury. Familywise error rate (FWE) that corrects for multiple comparisons was used to locate statistically significant regions of P < 0. 05 in voxel-based analysis. Subsequently, the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedure (corrected P < 0. 05) was used. FA map histogram analysis of histogram-derived indices, mean FA, <b>mean</b> FA <b>peak</b> <b>height,</b> and <b>peak</b> location was performed. Two-sample t test was used in all analyses. Using FWE-corrected P < 0. 05, there was a cluster of reduced anisotropy in the periventricular white matter lateral to the left ventricular atrium. When FDR-corrected P < 0. 05 was used, there were multiple clusters of reduced anisotropy in the periventricular white matter, the corpus callosum, and corona radiata. Simplified voxel-based morphometry (VBM) -like analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) did not show significant differences between patient and control subjects. 'White-matter FA map' histogram showed significant reduction in mean FA and <b>mean</b> FA <b>peak</b> location and significant increase in <b>mean</b> FA <b>peak</b> <b>height</b> in the patient group compared to control subjects (P = 0. 003, P = 0. 003, and P = 0. 014, respectively). This approach of quantifying FA can be applied to characterize anisotropy in the white matter after cranial irradiation and chemotherapy and can potentially be used to detect and monitor treatment-induced neurotoxicity. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Using myographic technique, the twitch properties of the sciatic-gastrocnemius muscle preparation of the common African toad was studied. Both the twitch <b>height</b> and <b>peak</b> tetanic <b>height</b> were measured as a percentage of control. Hexamethonium at a concentratration of 0. 1 mM significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced the mean twitch height from 2. 62 cm to 1. 0 cm and <b>mean</b> <b>peak</b> tetanic <b>height</b> from 5. 38 cm to 4. 32 cm. Hexamethonium, however does not produce tetanic fade at the same concentration.

The present analysis is carried out on five sets of occultation profiles, all at high solar zenith angles (SZA). Variations spanning 2 -Martian years are investigated near aphelion conditions at high Northern latitudes (64. 7 - 77. 6 N). A <b>mean</b> ionospheric <b>peak</b> <b>height</b> of 133. 5 - 135 km was obtained for all aphelion profiles near SZA = 78 - 82; a corresponding <b>mean</b> <b>peak</b> density of 7. 3 - 8. 5 x 10 (exp 4) /cu cm was also measured, reflecting solar moderate conditions. Strong wave 2 - 3 oscillations in <b>peak</b> <b>heights</b> were observed as a function of longitude over both Martian seasons. The Mars Thermospheric General Circulation Model (MTGCM) is exercised for Mars aphelion conditions. The measured interannual variations in the mean and longitude structure of the <b>peak</b> <b>heights</b> are small (consistent with MTGCM simulations), signifying the repeatability of the Mars atmosphere during aphelion conditions. A non-migrating (semi-diurnal period, wave#l eastward propagating) tidal mode is likely responsible for the wave# 3 longitude features identified. The height of this photochemically driven peak can be observed to provide an ongoing monitor of the changing state of the Mars lower atmosphere. The magnitudes of these same peaks may reflect more than changing solar EUV fluxes when they are located in the vicinity of Mars crustal magnetic field centers...|$|R

In the method, solvents in air could be accurately and precisely determined, because carbon disulfide, which interfered with target solvents in gas chromatography, {{was not used to}} extract. The recovery rates of common eight organic solvents were examined and high recoveries, more than 90 percent, were obtained in the solvents except acetone and methyl ethyl ketone.

The present analysis is carried out on five sets of occultation profiles, all at high solar zenith angles (SZA). Variations spanning 2 Martian years are investigated near aphelion conditions at high northern latitudes (64. 7 - 77. 6 N) making use of four of these data sets. A <b>mean</b> ionospheric <b>peak</b> <b>height</b> of 133. 5 - 135 km is obtained near SZA = 78 - 82 deg.; a corresponding <b>mean</b> <b>peak</b> density of 7. 3 - 8. 5 x l 0 (exp 4) / qu cm is also measured during solar moderate conditions at Mars. Strong wave number 2 - 3 oscillations in <b>peak</b> <b>heights</b> are consistently observed as a function of longitude over the 2 Martian years. These observed ionospheric features are remarkably similar during aphelion conditions 1 Martian year apart.

The PCR setup script of the Freedom EVO® 150 {{was based on}} the HID EVOlution™ System. However, substantial changes in the HID script were required before putting the system on stream in the routine. The CE setup of the Freedom EVO® 75 was based on a script made by application specialists of Tecan. For internal validation of the two robots, we investigated repeatability, reproducibility and occurrence of contaminations. The analysis of the reproducibility data demonstrated that electropherograms of samples pipetted by the robots had a lower <b>mean</b> size standard <b>peak</b> <b>height,</b> than the hand-pipetted samples, whereas the <b>mean</b> sample <b>peak</b> <b>height</b> did not differ between the two methods. This was mainly due to precision-differences between the robots and the hand-pipetting. The investigation of the occurrence of contaminations showed that with the PCR setup robot no sample got contaminated. The CE setup robot on the contrary revealed carryovers of samples from one well to the subsequent well. After intense examination, we discovered that the tip travel height was set too low, causing the tip to touch the rim of the 96 well plate which led to the carryovers. The contact between rim and tip could not be seen by naked eye, but after increasing the tip travel height, no further contamination was observed.

40|$|Regulatory Standards and Forensic Communities {{are expressing}} an {{expectation}} for HID products {{to be certified}} as “DNA-free. ” Recently, “DNA-free” status was described for HID-related products using ethylene oxide (EtO); this gas reduces the presence of amplifiable DNA and causes minimal interference to downstream HID-analytical methods. During sample collection, indicating cards, for example, Indicating FTA™ (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, UK), are used to collect and store buccal cell DNA. These cards contain a dye which changes color on application of a colorless sample. Generating “DNA-free” indicating cards using EtO should not impact the dyes' ability to indicate sample location or {{the efficacy of the}} card in downstream HID-analytical methods. This study was initiated to identify alternative dyes to those currently used with sample indicating collection cards. The most promising, dyes when applied to cellulose papers exhibited a uniform color distribution and excellent sample indicating properties even when mixed with chemicals associated with FTA™. When dyed cellulose papers were exposed to EtO, ultraviolet radiation, elevated temperature, and humidity, negligible fading or discoloration was observed. The presence of these dyes on cellulose papers did not interfere with direct short tandem repeat (STR) profiling. Allelic concordance, first pass success rate, and <b>mean</b> <b>peak</b> <b>heights</b> were comparable to samples applied to Indicating FTA. Biological samples applied to EtO-treated dyed cellulose papers and stored > 1 month produced full STR profiles of sufficient quality to allow submission to DNA databases, confirming negligible interference from EtO treatment.

40|$|Autocorrelation length (ACL) is {{a surface}} {{roughness}} parameter that provides spatial information of surfacetopography {{that is not}} included in amplitude parameters such as root-mean-square roughness. This paper presents a relationship between ACL and the friction behavior of a rough surface. The influence of ACL on the peak distribution of a profile is studied based on Whitehouse and Archard’s classical analysis [Whitehouse and ArchardProc. R. Soc. London, Ser. A 316, 97 (1970) ] and their results are extended to compare profiles from different surfaces. The probability density function of peaks and the <b>mean</b> <b>peak</b> <b>height</b> of a profile are given as functions of its ACL. These results are used to estimate the number of contact points when a rough surface comes into contact with a flat surface, and it is shown that the larger the ACL of the rough surface, the less the number of contact points. Based on Hertzian contact mechanics, it is shown that the real area of contact increases with increasing of number of contact points. Since adhesivefriction force is proportional to the real area of contact, this suggests that the adhesivefriction behavior of a surface will be inversely proportional to its ACL. Results from microscale friction experiments on polished and etchedsiliconsurfaces are presented to verify the analysis...|$|E

An agent capable of facilitating ethanol metabolism safely and effectively is of potential value in reducing the frequency of such incidents, and for individuals wishing to reduce their blood alcohol to levels below the legal limit before taking control of a vehicle. Here we show that fructose, at a dose of 1 g/kg, fulfils the criteria for such an agent. When ingested by healthy volunteers who had imbibed ethanol equivalent to 8 standard tots, it reduced the time required to attain a legal blood alcohol level (50 mg%) by approximately 70 min (n = 9). When ingested before a dose of alcohol equivalent to a double tot, fructose reduced both the magnitude and duration of the subsequent increase in blood alcohol; <b>mean</b> <b>peak</b> <b>height,</b> area under the curve, and time taken to reach zero were 39 %, 32 % and 51 %, respectively, of that observed in the absence of fructose (n = 12).

40|$|Unsustained matter {{distributions}} unescapely collapse unless {{fragmentation and}} centrifugal or pressure support take place. Starting {{from the above}} evidence, supermassive compact objects at the centre of large-mass galaxies are conceived as the end-product of the gravitational collapse of local density maxima around which overdensities are located. At the beginning of evolution, local density maxima are idealized as homogeneous peaks, while the surrounding envelopes are described by a power-law density profile. The dependence of the density profile on a second parameter, chosen to be the ratio between peak and total mass, is analysed. Overdensity evolution is discussed {{in the context of}} quintessence cosmological models and further investigation is devoted to a special case with the aim to describe the central collapse. An empirical relation between hole and dark halo mass is translated into a dependence of the fractional hole mass on the overdensity mass. Computations are performed up to the end of central collapse, and density profiles of related configurations are determined together with additional parameters. The central collapse is completed in early times, no longer than a few hundredths of Gyr, which implies hole formation when proto-haloes, proto-bulges, and proto-disks are still expanding or contracting. No appreciable change in evolution is found with regard to different <b>mean</b> <b>peak</b> <b>heights</b> related to equal masses. On the other hand, it is recognized that homogeneous peaks collapse ``faster'' with respect to surroundings envelopes, in low-mass than in large-mass overdensities. In conclusion, it is inferred that gravitational collapse of homogeneous peaks within overdensities may be a viable mechanism for hole generation.

Adrenal steroid profiles obtained by 30 -minute sampling were analyzed by the Pulsar program. In comparison to normal children, the 24 -hour quantitative parameters of 17 -OHP and D 4 A secretion were significantly greater in NCCAH patients, but serum cortisol concentrations were similar in the two groups. When daytime and nighttime hormone releases were separately analyzed, a significant nocturnal elevation of the cortisol area under the curve above zero level (AUCo) and 12 -hour mean and 17 -OHP AUCo, AUC above baseline, <b>mean</b> <b>peak</b> <b>height,</b> amplitude, area, and 12 -hour mean was detected in normal subjects only.

Cerebral cortex spongiform change, {{one of the}} classical pathological features of prion disease, resolves in prion-infected transgenic mice following prion protein gene knockout. We investigated the cross-sectional, longitudinal and post-mortem cerebral magnetization transfer ratios as a surrogate for prion disease pathology. Twenty-three prion disease patients with various prion protein gene mutations and 16 controls underwent magnetization transfer ratio and conventional magnetic resonance imaging at 1. 5 T. For each subject, whole-brain, white and grey matter magnetization transfer ratio histogram <b>mean,</b> <b>peak</b> <b>height,</b> peak location, and magnetization transfer ratio at 25 th, 50 th and 75 th percentile were computed and correlated with several cognitive, functional and neuropsychological scales. Highly significant associations were found between whole brain magnetization transfer ratio and prion disease (P < 0. 01). Additionally, highly significant correlations were found between magnetization transfer ratio histogram parameters and clinical, functional and neuropsychological scores (P < 0. 01). Longitudinally, decline in the Clinician's Dementia Rating scale was correlated with decline in magnetization transfer ratio. To investigate the histological correlates of magnetization transfer ratio, formalin-fixed cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres from 19 patients and six controls underwent magnetization transfer ratio imaging at 1. 5 T, with mean magnetization transfer ratio calculated from six regions of interest, and findings were followed-up in six variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases with 9. 4 T high-resolution magnetization transfer imaging on frontal cortex blocks, with semi-quantitative histopathological scoring of spongiosis, astrocytosis and prion protein deposition. Post-mortem magnetization transfer ratios was significantly lower in patients than controls in multiple cortical and subcortical regions, but not frontal white matter. Measurements (9. 4 T) revealed a significant and specific negative correlation between cortical magnetization transfer ratios and spongiosis (P = 0. 02), but not prion protein deposition or gliosis. The magnetic resonance imaging measurement of magnetization transfer ratios may be an in vivo surrogate for spongiform change and has potential utility as a therapeutic biomarker in human prion disease...|$|E

40|$|Simulated {{dark matter}} haloes are fitted by self-similar, {{universal}} density profiles, where the scaled parameters depend {{only on a}} scaled (truncation) radius, ≡ = R/r 0, which, in turn, {{is supposed to be}} independent of the mass and the formation redshift. The further assumption of a lognormal distribution (for a selected mass bin) of the scaled radius, or concentration, in agreement with the data from a large statistical sample of simulated haloes (Bullock et al. 2001), allows (at least to a first approximation) a normal or lognormal distribution for other scaled parameters, via the same procedure which leads to the propagation of the errors. A criterion is proposed for the choice of the best fitting density profile, with regard to a set of high-resolution simulations, where some averaging procedure on scaled density profiles has been performed, in connection with a number of fitting density profiles. To this aim, a minimum value of the ratio, |xή|/σsή = |ή-η*|/σsή, is required to yield the best fit, where ή is the arithmetic mean over the whole set; η*is its counterpart related to the fitting density profile; σsή is the standard deviation from the mean; and η is a selected, scaled i. e. dimensionless parameter. The above criterion is applied to a pair of sets each made of a dozen of high-resolution simulations, FM 01 (Fukushige and Makino 2001) and KLA 01 (Klypin et al. 2001), in connection with two currently used fitting density profiles, NFW (e. g. Navarro et al. 1997) and MOA (e. g. Moore et al. 1999), where the dependence of the scaled radius on the mass and the formation redshift may be neglected to a first extent. With regard to FM 01 and KLA 01 samples, the best fits turn out to be MOA and NFW, respectively. In addition, the above results also hold in dealing with rms errors derived via the propagation of the errors, with regard to the distributions of scaled parameters. The sensitivity error of simulations is also estimated and shown to be less than the related, standard deviation, that is a necessary condition for detectability of accidental errors. Some features of the early evolution of dark matter haloes, represented by fitting density profiles, are discussed in the limit of the spherical top-hat model. Although the related matter distributions appear to be poorly representative of simulated haloes, unless the (<b>mean)</b> <b>peak</b> <b>height</b> is an increasing function of the mass, the results are shown to be consistent, provided considerable acquisition of angular momentum takes place during the expansion phase...|$|E
40|$|Surfaces of {{materials}} strongly affect functional properties such as mechanical, biological, optical, acoustic and electronic properties {{of materials}}, {{particularly at the}} micro/nano scale. Surface effects stem from the interplay of surface morphology and surface chemical properties. This dissertation focuses on (1) modeling the effect of surface roughness parameters on solid-solid contact and solid-liquid interaction as well as; (2) developing a surface engineering method that can generate random surfaces with desired amplitude and spatial roughness parameters for tribological and biomimetic applications.;Autocorrelation length (ACL) is a surface roughness parameter that provides spatial information of surface topography that {{is not included in}} amplitude parameters such as root-mean-square roughness. A relationship between ACL and the friction behavior of a rough surface was developed. The probability density function of peaks and the <b>mean</b> <b>peak</b> <b>height</b> of a profile were given as functions of its ACL. These results were used to estimate the number of contact points when a rough surface comes into contact with a flat surface, and it was shown that the larger the ACL of the rough surface, the less the number of contact points. Based on Hertzian contact mechanics, it was shown that the real area of contact increases with increasing of number of contact points. Results from microscale friction experiments (where friction force is proportional to real area of contact) on polished and etched silicon surfaces are presented to verify the analysis.;A versatile surface processing method based on electrostatic deposition of particles and subsequent dry etching was shown to be able to independently tailor the amplitude and spatial roughness parameters of the resulting surfaces. Statistical models were developed to connect process variables to the amplitude roughness parameters center line average, root mean square and the spatial parameter, autocorrelation length of the final surfaces. Process variables include particle coverage, which affected both amplitude and spatial roughness parameters, particle size, which affected only spatial parameters and etch depth, which affects only amplitude parameters. The autocorrelation length of the final surface closely followed a power law decay with particle coverage, the most significant processing parameter. Center line average, root mean square followed a nonlinear relation with particle coverage and particle size. Experimental results on silicon substrates agreed reasonably well with model predictions.;This same hybrid surface engineering process was used to demonstrate adhesion and friction reduction. Microscale adhesion and friction tests were conducted on flat (smooth) and processed silicon surfaces with a low elastic modulus thermoplastic rubber (Santoprene) probe that allowed a large enough contact area to observe the feature size effect. Both adhesion and friction force of the processed surfaces were reduced comparing to that of the flat surfaces.;The process is also used to generate superhydrophobic engineering surfaces by mimicking the structure of lotus leaves. Tunable bimodal roughness (in both micro and nano scale) and a thin hydrophobic fluorocarbon film were generated on an engineering material surface by the hybrid process. These surfaces exhibit contact angles with water of more than 160 °. A geometric model was developed to related air-trapping ability of hydrophobic surfaces with hillock features to process variables (hillock diameter, etching depth and coverage) and contact angle. The model is shown to be able to predict minimum coverage of hillocks required for air-trapping on hydrophobic rough surfaces. The model predictions agree with experimental observations reasonably well. This model can particularly be extended to utilizing statistical roughness parameters to predict air-trapping for rough hydrophobic surfaces...|$|E
40|$|The {{developments}} of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the short tandem repeat multiplex kits increased the ease and lowered the time and sample quantity required for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) typing compared to previous methods. However the amplification of low mass of DNA can lead to increased stochastic effects, such as allele drop-out (ADO) and heterozygous peak height (PH) imbalance, which {{make it difficult to}} determine the true donor profile. These stochastic effects are believed to be due to: 1) pre-PCR sampling from pipetting and sample transferal of dilute samples prior to amplification resulting in unbalanced heterozygous allele templates in the amplification reaction, and 2) the kinetics of the PCR process where, when few target templates are available, there is uneven amplification of heterozygous alleles during early PCR cycles. This study looks to examine the contribution of PCR chemistry and pre-PCR sampling errors on stochastic effects by utilizing a single-tube DNA extraction and direct amplification method. Cells were collected into tubes using the McCrone and Associates, Inc. cell transfer method, which allowed for approximation of DNA mass without quantification. The forensicGEM® Saliva Kit was used to lyse the cells and inactivate nucleases without inhibiting downstream amplification. The samples were then directly amplified with the AmpFLSTR® Identifiler® Plus PCR Amplification Kit. These samples should only show the effects of PCR chemistry since pipetting and tube transferal steps prior to amplification were removed with the expectation that equal numbers of heterozygous alleles are present in the sample pre-amplification. Comparisons of PH imbalance were made to samples extracted with forensicGEM® but had one or more pipetting and tube transferal steps prior to amplification. These samples were either created through the dilution of stock DNA or from the cell transfer method where aliquots were then taken for amplification; thus these samples would exhibit the effects of both pre-PCR sampling and PCR chemistry errors and inefficiencies. The use of carrier ribonucleic acid (cRNA) was also added to cell transfer samples prior to the amplification of samples to see if it assisted with amplification and increased signal. Results show that the samples with only PCR chemistry generally have significantly higher <b>mean</b> <b>peak</b> <b>height</b> ratios (PHRs) than samples with both pre-PCR sampling and PCR chemistry except in cases where there were large numbers of ADOs. When compared to the diluted samples, the cell transfer samples had significantly higher mean PHR at 0. 0625 ng and 0. 125 ng, and higher mean PHR at 0. 0375 ng when PHs from ADOs are included. Average peak heights (APHs) in the cell transfer samples were also significantly higher in these comparisons. When compared to aliquots taken from cell transfer samples, mean PHR was significantly higher at 0. 0625 ng in cell transfer samples with only PCR chemistry than cell transfer samples with both pre-PCR sampling and PCR chemistry; however APH for the samples with only PCR chemistry was also significantly higher in one experiment and not significantly different in another. In a third experiment, the difference in mean PHR was not significant while APH was significantly higher in the samples with pre-PCR sampling and PCR chemistry; however there were also a large numbers of ADOs. Our results also found quantification of dilute samples unreliable but cell counting through the cell transfer method is an appropriate alternative for DNA mass approximation. Also there were no significant changes in PHR or APH in {{the presence or absence of}} cRNA...|$|E

To {{study the}} mesospheric {{temperature}} inversion, daily temperature profiles {{obtained from the}} Halogen Oc-cultation Experiment (HALOE) aboard the Upper Atmo-spheric Research Satellite (UARS) during the period 1991 – 2001 over the Indian tropical region (0 – 30 ◦ N, 60 – 100 ◦ E) have been analyzed for the altitude range 34 – 86 km. The fre-quency of occurrence of inversion {{is found to be}} 67 % over this period, which shows a strong semiannual cycle, with a maximum occurring one month after equinoxes (May and November). Amplitude of inversion is found to be as high as 40 K. Variation of monthly <b>mean</b> <b>peak</b> and bottom <b>heights</b> along with amplitude of inversions also show the semian-nual cycle. The inversion layer is detected most frequently in the altitude range of 70 – 85 km, with <b>peak</b> <b>height</b> rang-ing from 80 to 83 km and that of the bottom height from 72 to 74 km. A comparison of frequency of temperature in-version with that obtained from Rayleigh lidar observations over Gadanki (13. 5 ◦ N, 60 – 100 ◦ E) is found to be reasonable. The seasonal variation of amplitude and frequency of occur-rence of temperature inversion indicates a good correlation with seasonal variation of average ozone concentration over the altitude range of the inversion layer.

XRPD profiles were measured five times each for 11 standard samples containing of THA and THM. THM content in the standard samples was evaluated based on XRPD profiles by the diffraction <b>peak</b> <b>height</b> and area methods, and the Wakelin’s and principal component regression (PCR) methods, respectively. Since THA and THM were cube- and rod-shaped particles, the standard samples consisted of THA and THM showed crystal orientation due to THM crystal shape. THA showed reproducible XRPD profiles, but THM showed fluctuating intensities in some specific peaks in the profiles. The linear calibration models were evaluated based on calibration XRPD datasets of the standard materials by various methods. In the result based on validation XRPD datasets, the order of the mean bias and the <b>mean</b> accuracy were <b>peak</b> <b>height</b> > <b>peak</b> area > Wakelin’s > PCR, indicating that PCR was the best method to correct sample crystal orientation.

40|$|Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) for the {{evaluation}} of in vivo cerebral metabolite ratios is a relatively new radiological modality, which permits the detection and evaluation of specific metabolites within the human body. As with all imaging modalities, the accuracy of the equipment to perform its given task is paramount and the effect of introduction of elements and/or contrast agents to a study, must be understood before a diagnosis or prognosis can be made with any degree of certainty. The following chapters describe the development and testing of a phantom, the development and testing of metabolite simulating solutions and the experiments conducted to determine the spatial localisation accuracy of a MRS imaging system. This thesis begins with a description of the steps undertaken to investigate a clinical MRS system's capacity to reliably produce spectra over both the long and short term. Validation of the phantom construction, metabolite simulating solutions and spatial localisation accuracy is presented in detail. The construction of the localisation phantom resulted in a two compartment perspex phantom and the development of the aqueous metabolite solutions produced two solutions with distinct and separate metabolite peaks with comparable peak amplitudes and sufficient line width separation to prevent possible metabolite resonance cross contamination but without illustrating any significant susceptibility artefacts. Development of the metabolite simulating solutions was {{a major part of the}} work conducted. Short and long term (1 year) reproducibility of the measured metabolite peak amplitudes were assessed for four different pulse sequences. Of these, the most reproducible results were obtained with a TE 270 ms PRESS sequence (coefficient of variation < 0. 6 % (short term) and < 3 % (long term)). The spatial localisation experiments illustrated a disturbing error in the placement of the user prescribed volume of interest (VOI) with respect to the actual VOI acquisition with a difference between the two volumes of interest of up to 3 mm or 15 % of the VOI size in two axes. Possible effects of magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents, specifically Gd-DTPA were also investigated. Fifty patients were included in this study. The metabolic peak amplitudes were measured pre and post-administration of the contrast agent for each subject. A paired t-test demonstrated that there was no significant difference between the <b>mean</b> <b>peak</b> <b>heights</b> pre- and post- administration (0. 07 < p < 0. 9 for the various peak amplitudes measured) ...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral {{small vessel}} disease (SVD) {{is the major}} cause of {{vascular}} cognitive impairment, resulting in significant disability and reduced quality of life. Cognitive tests {{have been shown to}} be insensitive to change in longitudinal studies and, therefore, sensitive surrogate markers are needed to monitor disease progression and assess treatment effects in clinical trials. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is thought to offer great potential in this regard. Sensitivity of the various parameters that can be derived from DTI is however unknown. We aimed to evaluate the differential sensitivity of DTI markers to detect SVD progression, and to estimate sample sizes required to assess therapeutic interventions aimed at halting decline based on DTI data. We investigated 99 patients with symptomatic SVD, defined as clinical lacunar syndrome with MRI confirmation of a corresponding infarct as well as confluent white matter hyperintensities over a 3 year follow-up period. We evaluated change in DTI histogram parameters using linear mixed effect models and calculated sample size estimates. Over a three-year follow-up period we observed a decline in fractional anisotropy and increase in diffusivity in white matter tissue and most parameters changed significantly. <b>Mean</b> diffusivity <b>peak</b> <b>height</b> was the most sensitive marker for SVD progression as it had the smallest sample size estimate.

40|$|Background: Glioma grading assumes {{significant}} {{importance in}} that low- and high-grade gliomas display different prognoses and {{are treated with}} dissimilar therapeutic strategies. The objective of our study was to retrospectively assess the usefulness of a cumulative normalized cerebral blood volume (nCBV) histogram for glioma grading based on 3 T MRI. Methods: From February 2010 to April 2012, 63 patients with astrocytic tumors underwent 3 T MRI with dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion-weighted imaging. Regions of interest containing the entire tumor volume were drawn on every section of the co-registered relative CBV (rCBV) maps and T 2 -weighted images. The percentile values from the cumulative nCBV histograms and the other histogram parameters were correlated with tumor grades. Cochran’s Q test and the McNemar test were {{used to compare the}} diagnostic accuracies of the histogram parameters after the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Using the parameter offering the highest diagnostic accuracy, a validation process was performed with an independent test set of nine patients. Results: The 99 th percentile of the cumulative nCBV histogram (nCBV C 99), <b>mean</b> and <b>peak</b> <b>height</b> differed significantly between low- and high-grade gliomas (P =, 0. 001, 0. 014 and, 0. 001, respectively) and between grade III and IV gliomas (P =, 0. 001, 0. 001 and, 0. 001, respectively).

Each proximal root surface was standardized with 600 A grit silicone carbide paper and polished with either waxed dental floss, Superfloss, wood or plastic interdental cleaners, using alkali aluminum silicate polishing paste. All specimens were mounted on a flossing machine and polished with 10 or 20 strokes.
