40|$|Discontinuities {{and size}} of the weld deposit are {{affected}} by many factors. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>arc</b> <b>blow</b> is one of the factors that one may not be aware of. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>arc</b> <b>blow</b> was studied in this research with the ground position and welding current were varied. The discontinuities {{and size of}} the weld deposit were observed and measured by taking specimens of the carbon steel of AISI 1021 welded by TIG welding process using argon as protective gas. Macro photographs and data {{of the size of the}} weld deposit show <b>magnetic</b> <b>arc</b> <b>blow</b> has strong influence on the size of the weld on the first cut section. This specimen was welded by using 200 Ampere with the ground placed in the starting point of the welding process. Undercut and incomplete penetration are commonly found as discontinuities in all cut sections of the specimens. While porosities occur mainly in the first section with high current. It 2 ̆ 7 s believed that these discontinuities occur due to the lack of shielding by the protective gas caused by very strong arc blow around the melt. Tungsten inclusions are also the common discontinuities to take place, they are found more when welding using high current (200 A). Their occurrence is because of the melting of the tip of the tungsten electrode caused by the high heat input [...] At the end of the weld, crater and spatter are always found. Backward arc blow are very strong at the end of the process that arises these defects. In Bahasa Indonesia : Cacat dan bentuk deposit hasil las busur listrik dipengaruhi oleh banyak faktor. Salah satunya yang sering tidak diketahui adalah adanya pengaruh <b>magnetic</b> <b>arc</b> <b>blow.</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>arc</b> <b>blow</b> dengan variasi penempatan ground dan besar arus las dipelajari dalam penelitian ini dengan mengamati pengaruhnya terhadap cacat dan mengukur penampang deposit las yang dihasilkan. Proses las yang diamati adalah las TIG pada baja AISI 1021 dengan gas pelindung argon dengan polaritas lurus (DCSP). Hasil foto makro dan pengukuran menunjukkan <b>magnetic</b> <b>arc</b> <b>blow</b> berpengaruh kuat pada ukuran dan bentuk deposit las pada potongan pertama menggunakan arus 200 A serta penempatan ground pada awal proses pengelasan. Cacat las undercut dan incomplete penetration adalah cacat yang umum dijumpai pada semua potongan. Sedangkan dominasi cacat porositas pada potongan pertama lasan dengan arus 200 A diduga karena kurangnya ruang perlindungan gas dalam daerah las. Inklusi tungsten banyak terjadi pada arus 200 A karena melelehnya ujung elektroda tungsten akibat input panas tinggi. Pada akhir pengelasan selalu dijumpai crater dan percikan. Kedua jenis cacat ini juga diyakini disebabkan oleh backward arc blow yang cukup besar terjadi pada akhir proses lasan.

40|$|Oxygen {{plasma arc}} cutting is widely {{employed}} in various industrial fields. In {{the case of}} cutting magnetized plates, the magnetic field is concentrated around the cutting front as cutting progresses, and the electromagnetic force induced by the leakage of magnetic field deflects the plasma jet. The deflected plasma jet leads to poor cutting quality and sometime causes damage to the electrode and nozzle because of double arc abnormal discharge.

30|$|<b>Arc</b> <b>blow</b> is a {{phenomenon}} in which the arc tends to become separated {{from the point of}} welding, as though a strong wind were blowing (Naidu et al. 2003). The reason for the occurrence of <b>arc</b> <b>blow</b> is imbalance in the magnetic field surrounding the workpiece (Gerbec 2009). Generally, this phenomenon occurs in three situations: (i) the direction of the current changes, (ii) there are magnetic materials around the welding arc, and (iii) there are magnetic materials {{near the edge of the}} plate (Naidu et al. 2003). <b>Arc</b> <b>blow</b> is generally found only with high DC welding currents. It can be prevented by reducing the current level, by using an AC welding current, and by demagnetizing the fixture (Gerbec 2009). Arc voltage affects arc deflection such that an arc with a lower voltage is shorter and stiffer and has better resistance to deflection than an arc with a higher arc voltage.|$|R

40|$|Twin-wire welding is a {{metal joining}} process that uses two {{electrodes}} to generate localized heat at the weld joint. Due {{to the effect}} of <b>magnetic</b> <b>arc</b> <b>blow,</b> both of the arcs direct towards each other and subsequently act as a single heat source. This heat source is basically a double-ellipsoidal moving heat source that follows Gaussian distribution. It causes melting of the specimen and formation of weld-pool. Numerical simulation of this entire phenomenon is a classical problem based on Gaussian distributed double-ellipsoidal moving heat source with fluid flow driven by Electro Magnetic Force (EMF), buoyancy, surface tension, marangoni stress and gravity. Three-dimensional physical model of the specimen is modeled using ANSYS-WORKBENCH environment. This model is imported into commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver ANSYS-FLUENT 12. 0. 1, which is based on Finite Volume Method (FVM) of discretization to solve the governing equations, initial and boundary conditions. The present work aims at developing the heat and fluid flow model for twin-wire welding process over the previous work based on steady state heat conduction alone.

Two cases are studied. In the first case, non-deflected arc and straigth magnectic deflected arc along the torch movement are carried out and compared to numerical simulations. Temperatures at three different points on the backside of the plates (two away from the welding center line and one in its center) and weld pools of SAE 1020 3. 2 mm and 6 mm thick steel plates are analyzed. Results obtained by numerical simulations are close to the experimental ones. In the second case, welding with weaving (frequency of 1 Hz) on 3 mm thick steel plates is analyzed.

The resulting test pieces were evaluated for parameters that imparted the best clad quality and the results indicate the following: 1) Magnetic steering of the arc reduces dilution and corrosion rate. 2) Magnetic steering of the arc permits use of higher currents for a given dilution level, thus increasing productivity. 3) Clad metal microstructures of a desirable type are obtained when the arc is magnetically steered. 4) Use of 309 L strips for single layer cladding appears to be satisfactory since ferrite content lies between 5 to 10 % for a variety of welding conditions. 5) The corrosion rate (microns per 24 hours) is linearly related to the dilution percentage of the clad metal...|$|R

30|$|Arc welding is {{a widely}} used joining method for {{aluminium}} alloys. Intense variations of energy, mass and momentum transfer occur {{from time to time}} at the terminating end of the weld, resulting in unsteady temperature and fluid flow fields.

Utilization of an appropriate dilution ratio and control of minor alloying elements, grain refinement and <b>magnetic</b> <b>arc</b> oscillations can minimise its occurrence. At certain compositional limits, the amount of eutectic liquid is large enough to form continuous films at grain boundaries. This combined with high shrinkage leads to solidification cracking.
