40|$|Increasing {{energy prices}} {{have led to}} the attempt of energy saving and are one of the main {{research}} areas in greenhouse plant production. Technical disintegration has been developed, and the greenhouse concept ‘Closed/Semi-Closed Greenhouse’ was introduced. The idea of this concept is to reduce energy consumption by cooling the greenhouse under high light intensities, and storing the heat in an underground aquifer to be regained for heating. In order to improve the efficiency of the concept the main focus of this work is investigating how high day temperatures the plants can tolerate at high CO 2 levels without a reduction in photosynthesis or growth. The average 24 hour temperature is the most important number for the development rate of plants. When day temperatures are high it is therefore desirable to lower the night temperatures. Plants that tolerate high day/low night temperatures will reduce the energy input for cooling in ‘Closed/Semi-Closed’ greenhouses during the day, and will reduce heating demand during the night. In this study we used different <b>maximum</b> <b>day</b> temperatures, low and moderate night temperatures, high and ambient CO 2 levels, and manipulation of light quality because high day/low night temperatures lead to shoot elongation. Eight species of herbs, basil (Ocimum basilicum), rocket (Eruca vesicaria), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), oregano (Origanum vulgare), lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), cilantro (Coriandrun sativum), sage (Salvia officinalis) and rosemary (Rosmarin officinalis) were used for investigating the effect of high day temperature on biomass production and morphology. The tomato varieties (Solanum lycopersicum “Mecano”, “Capricia”, “Cederico”) were used to investigate plant response on growth, pollination and fruit development under high day temperatures. The plants were grown in phytotron growth rooms, common greenhouse growth rooms, and gas exchange chambers. When testing the increase of red/far-red light ratio on the elongation of herbs, the plants were covered with a colored plastic film. The first two investigations were performed by increasing the <b>maximum</b> <b>day</b> temperature stepwise with increasing light intensity while keeping night temperatures steady. The third and fourth investigations were performed using natural increase of <b>maximum</b> <b>day</b> temperature from increasing light intensities, and different but steady night temperatures. The herbs responded positive to increased <b>maximum</b> <b>day</b> temperatures from 22 °C to 29 °C with increased dry matter production. An increase of the red/far-red ratio from 1. 1 to 10. 2 reduced the elongation growth, but also reduced dry matter production due to the 34 % lower light intensity below the plastic film. Increasing the <b>maximum</b> <b>day</b> temperature from 23 °C to 29 °C under high CO 2 conditions and constant night temperatures did not affect total dry matter production of the tomato plants, but reduced the yield when the <b>maximum</b> <b>day</b> temperature was higher than 23 °C, due to a reduction in fruit number and size. Above 23 °C <b>maximum</b> <b>day</b> temperature and constant night temperatures a high number of un-pollinated fruits developed. At constant mean day temperature, flowers developed under the highest day and lowest night temperatures (30 / 11 °C) showed the highest number of pollen and best germination. However, fruits developed under lower day and higher night temperatures (24 / 17 °C) had a higher amount of soluble solids, dry matter and titratable acid. The carbon exchange rate (CER) of single tomato plants increased under high CO 2 concentrations with increasing light up to a temperature of 40 - 45 °C. The CER was about 100 % higher for plants grown under high CO 2 conditions compared to plants grown under ambient conditions. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements showed no effect of high <b>maximum</b> <b>day</b> temperatures on the activity of photosystem II. Night temperatures down to 10 - 11 °C showed no negative effect on the CER during the following days and the dark respiration. The results achieved in this study show that under high CO 2 concentration and high light intensities, the <b>maximum</b> <b>day</b> temperature can be increased and low night temperatures can be accepted without any negative effects on photosynthesis and plant growth. These results can be used in the future to develop strategies with controlled <b>maximum</b> <b>day</b> temperatures in relation to lower night temperatures and combined with CO 2 strategies. They will have great potential for energy saving especially connected to the ‘Closed/Semi-Closed’ greenhouse concept...|$|R

40|$|The {{delivery}} scheduling {{process of}} a regional wholesaler was analyzed {{in order to develop}} a more strategic scheduling program. The strategic schedule was designed to utilize weekly demand history, opposed to daily demand, in order to decrease small batch deliveries, aid in store inventory management and foster customer relations. This was accomplished with a linear mathematical program, which produced a standard weekly schedule. A metric for the <b>maximum</b> <b>days</b> between deliveries was developed to show the improved delivery day distribution. For the 30 stores analyzed, the average <b>maximum</b> <b>days</b> between deliveries fell from 5. 04 days to 3. 37 days. The decreased time between deliveries will assist the small stores in inventory management. Additionally, the standardized schedule will allow storeowners and truck drivers to develop a productive relationship, which should be able to decrease delivery time and grow customer relations. by David Gilchrist.

5|$|In Europe, {{pyrethroids}} and neonicotinoids {{have been}} used against B. rufimanus. Because of the faba bean crop biology and its attraction to pollinators at flowering stage, restrictions on pesticides uses have been introduced in Europe. It is particularly advised to spray in absence of pollinators {{in the early morning}} and evening. In addition, due to B. rufimanus biology, a temperature threshold combined with crop development stage can be used to increase the success of chemical treatments. Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when <b>maximum</b> <b>day</b> temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days after treatment (Arvalis, 2016). Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when <b>maximum</b> <b>day</b> temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days after treatment. The end of blooming indicates the end of adult activity in the field. This stage is therefore a threshold marking the end of insecticide application and occurs no later than five days after last blooming. Forecasting systems (Bruchi-LIS, Arvalis, France and BruchidCast, Syngenta, UK) have been developed to optimize insecticide applications based on temperature and crop stage.|$|R

40|$|Background: Patients are {{increasingly}} being admitted with chronic atrial fibrillation, and disease-specific management might reduce recurrent admissions and prolong survival. However, evidence is scant to support the application of this therapeutic approach. We aimed to assess SAFETY [...] a management strategy that is specific to atrial fibrillation. Methods: We did a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial in patients admitted with chronic, non-valvular atrial fibrillation (but not heart failure). Patients were recruited from three tertiary referral hospitals in Australia. 335 participants were randomly assigned by computer-generated schedule (stratified for rhythm or rate control) to either standard management (n= 167) or the SAFETY intervention (n= 168). Standard management consisted of routine primary care and hospital outpatient follow-up. The SAFETY intervention comprised a home visit and Holter monitoring 7 - 14 days after discharge by a cardiac nurse with prolonged follow-up and multidisciplinary support as needed. Clinical reviews were undertaken at 12 and 24 months (minimum follow-up). Coprimary outcomes were death or unplanned readmission (both all-cause), measured as event-free survival {{and the proportion of}} actual versus <b>maximum</b> <b>days</b> alive and out of hospital. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTRN 12610000221055). Findings: During median follow-up of 905 days (IQR 773 - 1050), 49 people died and 987 unplanned admissions were recorded (totalling 5530 days in hospital). 127 (76 %) patients assigned to the SAFETY intervention died or had an unplanned readmission (median event-free survival 183 days [IQR 116 - 409]) and 137 (82 %) people allocated standard management achieved a coprimary outcome (199 days [116 - 249]; hazard ratio 0 · 97, 95 % CI 0 · 76 - 1 · 23; p= 0 · 851). Patients assigned to the SAFETY intervention had 99 · 5 % <b>maximum</b> event-free <b>days</b> (95 % CI 99 · 3 - 99 · 7), equating to a median of 900 (IQR 767 - 1025) of 937 <b>maximum</b> <b>days</b> alive and out of hospital. By comparison, those allocated to standard management had 99 · 2 % (95 % CI 98 · 8 - 99 · 4) <b>maximum</b> event-free <b>days,</b> equating to a median of 860 (IQR 752 - 1047) of 937 <b>maximum</b> <b>days</b> alive and out of hospital (effect size 0 · 22, 95 % CI 0 · 21 - 0 · 23; p= 0 · 039). Interpretation: A post-discharge management programme specific to atrial fibrillation was associated with proportionately more days alive and out of hospital (but not prolonged event-free survival) relative to standard management. Disease-specific management is a possible strategy to improve poor health outcomes in patients admitted with chronic atrial fibrillation.
