5|$|For {{manual welding}} methods, labor costs {{generally}} {{make up the}} vast majority of the total cost. As a result, many cost-saving measures are focused on minimizing operation time. To do this, welding procedures with high deposition rates can be selected, and weld parameters can be fine-tuned to increase welding speed. Mechanization and automation are often implemented to reduce labor costs, but this frequently increases the cost of equipment and creates additional setup time. <b>Material</b> <b>costs</b> tend to increase when special properties are necessary, and energy costs normally do not amount to more than several percent of the total welding cost.|$|E

Major infrastructure and tourist projects also began under Sir Tsang's second term, including the Ngong Ping Cable Car, Tian Tan Buddha and the West Kowloon Cultural District. However, the most controversial was the high-speed railway link connecting Hong Kong and neighbouring cities of mainland China; as of 2016, the project has suffered numerous delays, surging labour and <b>material</b> <b>costs</b> and dispute over immigration procedures.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen {{pipelines}} {{are more}} expensive than even long-distance electric lines. Hydrogen is about three times bulkier in volume than natural gas for the same enthalpy. Hydrogen accelerates the cracking of steel (hydrogen embrittlement), which increases maintenance costs, leakage rates, and <b>material</b> <b>costs.</b> The difference in cost is likely to expand with newer technology: wires suspended in air can use higher voltage with only marginally increased <b>material</b> <b>costs,</b> but higher pressure pipes require proportionally more material.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{researched}} is to identify and analyze the influence of raw <b>materials</b> <b>cost,</b> fuel cost and capital cost to value-added of tobacco processing industry in Indonesia. This research was used secondary data from the years 2000 - 2013, published by the Badan Pusat Statistik Indonesia. The analytical method used multiple linear regression analysis, the beta coefficient test and elasticity test with SPSS 21. The results of this research showed simultaneous raw <b>materials</b> <b>cost,</b> fuel cost and capital cost affect the value-added of tobacco processing industry in Indonesia. Partially fuel cost has no {{significant effect on the}} value-added of tobacco processing industry, while raw <b>materials</b> <b>cost</b> and capital cost significantly influence the value-added processing of the tobacco industry.

25|$|The moving {{assembly}} line system, which started on October 7, 1913, allowed Ford {{to sell his}} cars at a price lower than his competitors.

As volume increased, he was able to also lower the prices due to fixed costs being spread over a larger number of vehicles. Other factors affected the price such as <b>material</b> <b>costs</b> and design changes.|$|E

Little evidence has also been found to support the idea that oil prices will either stabilize or decrease once pipelines are constructed.|$|E

40|$|This study {{intended}} to seek measures to enhance competitive power and reduce production cost of Korean wood pellet industry through analysis of wood pellet manufacturing cost. For this, the manufacturing cost, {{total amount of}} <b>material</b> <b>cost,</b> labor cost, and other expenses occurred in manufacturing process, was analyzed and sensitivity analysis was conducted to understand change of the manufacturing <b>cost</b> depending on <b>material</b> use pattern change and output increase. As the results, it was analyzed that a factor giving the largest effect to the manufacturing cost of wood pellet was <b>material</b> <b>cost</b> and output. Especially, for the <b>material</b> <b>cost,</b> it was identified as more efficient method to reduce the manufacturing cost to produce wood pellet by mixing lumbering byproducts (sawdust) and forest management products (lumbers) in appropriate ratio rather than to use only lumbering byproducts or forest management products. In addition, because <b>material</b> <b>cost</b> per ton is calculated by dividing labor cost and expenses by output, it {{was identified as a}} measure to save the manufacturing cost to maintain output corresponding to production capacity of the manufacturer...|$|R
25|$|Smaller {{diameter}} coils {{have better}} rates of heat transfer than conventional sized coils {{and they can}} withstand higher pressures required by {{the new generation of}} environmentally friendlier refrigerants. Smaller diameter coils also have lower <b>material</b> <b>costs</b> because they require less refrigerant, fin, and coil materials; and they enable the design of smaller and lighter high-efficiency air conditioners and refrigerators because the evaporators and condensers coils are smaller and lighter. MicroGroove uses a grooved inner surface of the tube to increase the surface to volume ratio and increase turbulence to mix the refrigerant and homogenize temperatures across the tube.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, with rapidly rising oil prices, {{industries}} such as {{the automotive}} industry, are experiencing a combination of pricing pressures from raw <b>material</b> <b>costs</b> and changes in consumer buying habits. The industry is also facing increasing external competition from the public transport sector, as consumers re-evaluate their private vehicle usage. Roughly half of the US's fifty-one light vehicle plants are projected to permanently close in the coming years, {{with the loss of}} another 200,000 jobs in the sector, on top of the 560,000 jobs lost this decade. Combined with robust growth in China, in 2009, this resulted in China becoming the largest car producer and market in the world.|$|E
25|$|Compared to an {{internal}} combustion engine of the same power rating, Stirling engines currently have a higher capital cost and are usually larger and heavier. However, they are more efficient than most internal combustion engines. Their lower maintenance requirements make the overall energy cost comparable. The thermal efficiency is also comparable (for small engines), ranging from 15% to 30%. For applications such as micro-CHP, a Stirling engine is often preferable to {{an internal}} combustion engine. Other applications include water pumping, astronautics, and electrical generation from plentiful energy sources that are incompatible with the internal combustion engine, such as solar energy, and biomass such as agricultural waste and other waste such as domestic refuse. However, Stirling engines are generally not price-competitive as an automobile engine, because of high cost per unit power, low power density, and high <b>material</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E
