25|$|Haig {{preferred}} {{to continue the}} offensive, encouraged by Plumer's recent successful attacks in dry weather at Menin Road (20 September) and Polygon Wood (26 September), and stating that the Germans were “very worn out”. Robertson spoke to the Army Commanders, but declined Haig’s offer that he do so without Haig present. He later regretted not having done so, although {{he was aware of}} the ill-feeling which Painlevé had caused when he asked Nivelle's subordinates to criticise him. He later wrote in his memoirs that “I was not prepared to carry <b>my</b> <b>doubts</b> to the point of opposing (Haig)” or of preventing one more push which might have “convert(ed) an inconclusive battle into a decisive victory”.|$|E
500|$|He also stated: [...] "I have {{somewhat}} lost my enthusiasm [...] in {{the last}} four or five years. Mainly because film students using digital video these days have not really produced anything more than superficial or simplistic; so I have <b>my</b> <b>doubts.</b> Despite the great advantages of digital video and the great ease of using the medium, still those who use it have first to understand the sensitivities of how to best use the medium." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} quickly {{recorded}} in Los Angeles {{over the course}} of two weeks. In an interview with The Guardian, when asked about the expectations of the album, Tyler replied [...] "I don't know. I have <b>my</b> <b>doubts.</b> Everybody's going on it and I just think, fuck, everybody might hate this shit. Everybody might go: 'What the fuck is this? We wanted this, we wanted that.' There we go. We made an album we wanted to make. If everybody hates it, OK. We have an album we like." [...] The track [...] "Forest Green" [...] was released over a year before the release of the album but was featured on the project with remastered production.|$|E
60|$|MR MARCH. Yes, but <b>my</b> <b>doubt</b> {{is whether}} our {{instincts}} {{at this moment}} of the world's history are leading us up or down.|$|R
60|$|Prostrating myself {{before the}} eminent philosopher, I craved his pardon for <b>my</b> <b>doubt</b> of his sovereign's wisdom and consistency, and {{begged him to}} cut off my head.|$|R
60|$|This {{therefore}} strengtheneth <b>my</b> <b>doubt</b> {{about the}} affirmative {{of the first}} question, and also prepareth an argument for what I plead as to this we have now under consideration.|$|R
500|$|Anthony Lane, {{reviewing}} for The New Yorker, called The Fountain [...] "a gorgeous nimbus of confusion." [...] Lane {{complained about}} the film's up-close and far-away shots, [...] "What fails to concern or attract Aronofsky {{is the place where}} most of us hang out—the in-between, the midshot of everyday existence." [...] He summarized, [...] "The movie may have significant truths to impart, although I have <b>my</b> <b>doubts,</b> but it feels too inexperienced, too unworldly, to have earned the right to them." [...] Roger Ebert, who admired Aronofsky's previous films, conceded in the Chicago Sun-Times that The Fountain was [...] "not a great success." [...] He identified the film's issues: [...] "too many screens of blinding lights," [...] "too many transitions for their own sake," [...] and [...] "abrupt changes of tone." [...] He believed that the scaling down of the film from Aronofsky's original ambition lost some elements and anticipated a director's cut truer to Aronofsky's vision.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times Judy Berman {{praised the}} finale, stating [...] " [...] this year {{went out with}} a bang. I had <b>my</b> <b>doubts</b> and reservations, largely {{concerning}} Blair and Chuck, but I am surprised and pleased to report that I found the end of [...] "Gossip Girl" [...] Season 4 both exciting and satisfying." [...] The return of Georgina Sparks was well-received as with Serena's development, with Berman citing Serena's confession with Charlie before she could plunge to her death. [...] "This debacle, along with the events of this season in general, seems to have given S some perspective. Friends, she apologizes to Nate and Dan for leading them on and confesses to Charlie that her decision-making skills leave something to be desired! Even if lazy writing results in Serena falling into old habits next season, it's a pretty gratifying moment." [...] Berman also questioned Vanessa's motive behind publishing Dan's novel [...] "it's impossible to know whether she's trying to do her old friend one last favor or profit from stirring up more drama in his life. Considering that Jessica Szohr won't be returning to the show in the fall, we may never find out." [...] Berman also complimented the casting of director David O Russell calling it [...] "one of the show's most delightfully random cameos ever". New York Magazine labeled Chuck and Blair's relationship as the [...] "Longest-Delayed Breakup" [...] of the season, adding that [...] "the big news was that Blair and Prince Louis are somehow still together and engaged, with the wedding scheduled for November sweeps. We feel comfortable assuming that by then, Chuck will have regrouped enough to break things up more definitively." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Anthony's sister Hannah was on {{her death}} bed, she asked Susan {{to talk about the}} great beyond, but, Anthony later wrote, [...] "I could not dash her faith with <b>my</b> <b>doubts,</b> nor could I pretend a faith I had not; so I was silent in the dread {{presence}} of death." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>doubted</b> and {{dangerous}} companion signed {{to me to}} enter the carriage--the man who had ridden {{on the left side}} of my horse stepped in after me, and drawing up the blinds of the vehicle, gave the signal for instant departure.|$|R
6000|$|These were {{tremendous}} sayings. They were impossibilities to my reason, but to {{my heart}} they rang true; and so, while <b>my</b> reason <b>doubted,</b> <b>my</b> heart believedbelieved, and held fast to the belief from that day. Presently I said: ...|$|R
6000|$|Leo. I fear {{to try new}} love, As boys {{to venture}} on the unknown ice, That {{crackles}} underneath them while they slide. Oh, how shall I describe this growing ill! Betwixt <b>my</b> <b>doubt</b> and love, methinks I stand Altering, like one that waits an ague fit; And yet, would this were all! ...|$|R
2500|$|Blackmun {{has been}} noted {{for the fact that}} {{compared}} to other Justices on the Supreme Court, he had let his law clerks utilize great latitude as far as writing opinions for him, such as his opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which was written by Stephanie Dangel, now a lawyer in Pennsylvania. Blackmun's Casey opinion draft included sharp criticism of Chief Justice Rehnquist, which included, according to Dangel, a sarcastic reference to Rehnquist as [...] "The Chief" [...] rather than Chief Justice because [...] "I have <b>my</b> <b>doubts</b> as to whether he deserves to be called 'justice' on this one." [...] Dangel, however, changed it to [...] "Chief Justice" [...] at the urging of Justice Anthony Kennedy.|$|E
2500|$|In 1919, {{the magician}} P. T. Selbit staged a séance {{at his own}} flat in Bloomsbury. Doyle {{attended}} the séance. Some later commentators have stated that he declared the clairvoyance manifestations to be genuine. However, the contemporary report by the Sunday Express quotes Doyle as saying: [...] "I should {{have to see it}} again before passing a definite opinion on it," [...] and: [...] "I have <b>my</b> <b>doubts</b> about the whole thing". In 1920, Doyle debated the claims of Spiritualism with the notable sceptic Joseph McCabe at Queen's Hall in London. McCabe later published his evidence against the claims of Doyle and Spiritualism in a booklet entitled Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud? which claimed Doyle had been duped into believing Spiritualism by mediumship trickery.|$|E
2500|$|Game {{seven of}} the series {{was the first time}} a crowd of over 16,000 {{attended}} a hockey game in Canada. 16,218 fans squeezed into Maple Leaf Gardens and remained an hour after the game waiting for the Leafs to reappear from the dressing room. Coach Hap Day, who played for the Leafs in their last Stanley Cup win in 1932, deadpanned [...] "We won it the hard way." [...] He was asked if he had any doubts during the series, and replied [...] "I had <b>my</b> <b>doubts</b> right up until that final bell rang." [...] Rookie Gaye Stewart, who joined the club for the fifth game of the final, became the youngest player to win the Stanley Cup as he was still 18 years of age.|$|E
6000|$|But he hath eyes so {{round and}} bright, [...] As make away <b>my</b> <b>doubt,</b> [...] Where Love may all his torches light [...] Though hate had put them out; [...] 25 [...] But then, t'increase my fears, [...] What nymph soe'er his voice but hears, [...] Will be my rival, though she have but ears.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tis silent all!--but on my ear[ah] [...] The well remembered Echoes thrill; [...] I hear a voice I {{would not}} hear, [...] A voice that now {{might well be}} still: [...] Yet oft <b>my</b> <b>doubting</b> Soul 'twill shake; [...] Ev'n Slumber owns its gentle tone, [...] Till Consciousness will vainly wake [...] To listen, though the dream be flown.|$|R
60|$|So far I had the {{substance}} of the club with me, but I opened new ground and set Crupp agog by confessing <b>my</b> <b>doubt</b> from which party or combination of groups these developments of science and literature and educational organisation could most reasonably be expected. I looked up to find Crupp's dark little eye intent upon me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I kept {{some little}} {{distance}} behind him at first, {{to turn the}} thing over in my mind, and to be satisfied that <b>my</b> <b>doubts</b> were not misleading me. We have no concealments from each other; and you shall know what <b>my</b> <b>doubts</b> were.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Candidly {{to confess}} {{everything}} that has occurred to me,' said James Harthouse, again gliding with the same appearance of effort into his more airy manner; 'I will confide to you <b>my</b> <b>doubt</b> whether he has had many advantages. Whether - forgive my plainness - whether any great amount of confidence {{is likely to have}} been established between himself and his most worthy father.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Teidelmann's smile {{strengthened}} <b>my</b> <b>doubt.</b> [...] "Dear me," [...] she said, [...] "I {{am afraid}} I {{must be very}} wicked. I have always regarded a pantomime as quite a moral entertainment. All the bad people go down so very straight to--well, to the fit and proper place for them. And we could promise to leave before the Clown stole the sausages, couldn't we, Paul?" ...|$|R

60|$|I cannot {{make sure}} whether I wrote to you yesterday, and {{told you that}} we had done very well at the first reading after all, even in money. The {{reception}} was prodigious, and the readings are the town talk. But I rather think I did actually write this to you. <b>My</b> <b>doubt</b> on the subject arises from my having deliberated about writing on a Saturday.|$|R
5000|$|St. Augustine of Hippo, {{considered}} one of the greatest Fathers of the Church, converted to the Catholic Church upon hearing a boy tell him" [...] "Take, read; take, read." [...] He recounted that [...] "I took (the epistles of Paul the Apostle), I opened, I read in silence; it was as though the darkness of all <b>my</b> <b>doubting</b> was driven away by the light of peace which had entered my soul." ...|$|R

60|$|He {{threw himself}} {{down on the}} ground and clasped my ankles. But I had <b>my</b> <b>doubts</b> about Gunga Dass's benevolence, and kicked him off as he lay protesting.|$|E
60|$|I {{suppose that}} <b>my</b> <b>doubts</b> and {{irritation}} were {{apparent in the}} inelegant jocosity of my manner. At any rate, Stephen Strong, who was a shrewd observer, took alarm.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Better {{you than}} a hundred! <b>My</b> <b>doubt</b> was this. You {{know there are}} a great many of us, and papa wants to see us well married.

But what you have said sets me quite at ease in refusing him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That any man, my dear sir, could {{possibly}} be the happier for not knowing you,' he returned, 'you will excuse <b>my</b> <b>doubting.</b> But that Mr Anthony, in the evening of his life, was happier in the affection of his excellent son--a pattern, my dear sir, a pattern to all sons--and {{in the care of}} a distant relation who, however lowly in his means of serving him, had no bounds to his inclination; I can inform you.' ...|$|R
60|$|Thus {{the woman}} countenanced the wooing, petting, and {{enriching}} with gifts the happy child, while she silenced <b>my</b> own <b>doubts</b> {{and those of}} the Doña Maria.|$|R
