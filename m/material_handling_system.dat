5000|$|Coordinating the {{activities}} of the various material handling sub-systems {{is the role of the}} warehouse control system (WCS). The WCS directs the [...] "real-time" [...] data management and interface responsibilities of the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> as well as provides common user interface screens for monitoring, control, and diagnostics. As the focal point for managing the operational aspects of the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> <b>system,</b> the WCS provides the critical link between the non-real time based host and the real-time MHE control system. It receives information from the upper level Host and coordinates the various real-time control devices (conveyors, print and apply applicators, etc.) to accomplish the daily workload. At each decision point, the WCS determines the most efficient routing of the product and transmits directives to the equipment controllers to achieve the desired result.At the lowest level, closest to the physical equipment, are the equipment controller(s). These controllers are typically some form of a programmable logic controller (PLC) or a dedicated, real-time PC control system. They interface to peripheral Input/Output (I/O) devices such as photo-eyes scanners, motors, etc. as well as data collection devices such as bar code scanners (barcode reader) and weigh scales and are responsible for the physical operation of the material handling equipment. The equipment controllers are also responsible for the physical handling of product and tracking it from point-to-point based on the direction from the upper level control systems. Typically a single controller is only concerned with the operations of a defined area or sub-system of the overall <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Materials</b> <b>handling</b> <b>systems</b> are an {{integrating}} {{component of}} a manufacturing system and as such must be considered within an integrated approach to manufacturing systems design. This work proposes to integrate the operation allocation and the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> selection problems in a flexible manufacturing system by extending the operation allocation model to include some aspects of <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> design. The objective of the operation allocation model is to select a group of machines where {{the operations of the}} part types will be performed and then to assign those operations to the selected machines. The operation allocation model interfaces with the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> selection model by providing input data {{in the form of the}} manufacturing operations to be performed at each machining center. The selection of the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> is centered on the matching of the parts visiting a machining center to perform a manufacturing operation and the abilities of the handling equipment to perform the required <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> functions of those part types. The objective is to select an optimal group of <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> equipment to be assigned to a cell. A computer program was developed to greatly automate the process of solving the models. This allows the program to be used as a rapid modeling tool.

50|$|An Industrial Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) {{consists}} of robots, Computer-controlled Machines, Numerical controlled machines (CNC), instrumentation devices, computers, sensors, and other stand alone {{systems such as}} inspection machines. The use of robots in the production segment of manufacturing industries promises a variety of benefits ranging from high utilization to high volume of productivity. Each Robotic cell or node will be located along a <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> such as a conveyor or automatic guided vehicle. The production of each part or work-piece will require a different combination of manufacturing nodes. The movement of parts from one node to another is done through the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> <b>system.</b> At the end of part processing, the finished parts will be routed to an automatic inspection node, and subsequently unloaded from the Flexible Manufacturing System.The FMS data traffic {{consists of}} large files and short messages, and mostly come from nodes, devices and instruments. The message size ranges between a few bytes to several hundreds of bytes. Executive software and other data, for example, are files with a large size, while messages for machining data, instrument to instrument communications, status monitoring, and data reporting are transmitted in small size.|$|E
