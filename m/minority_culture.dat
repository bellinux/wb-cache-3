500|$|When {{the news}} of Selena's death broke, some Americans asked who she was {{and said she was}} [...] "not that important", {{suggesting}} Latinos [...] "get over it". Author and Texas Monthly magazine contributor Joe Nick Patoski said Anglo-Americans and Mexican-Americans were divided in their reactions to Selena's death. Patoski said that Anglo-Americans [...] "didn't understand what all the fuss was about". This was echoed in the Corpus Christi Caller Times, where they found racial divisions in the reactions to Selena's death. Educators who had observed the reactions said, [...] "the emergence of an icon in a <b>minority</b> <b>culture</b> can be both bewildering and threatening to Anglos". Melicent Rothschild said some Americans often do not understand [...] "the cultural role models of groups who have felt discriminated against". Following Selena's death, cultural confrontations were reported. some vocally opposed any memorials to the singer, feeling they would be costed to taxpayers. Others complained to newspapers about the media interest in Selena's death. Many media outlets received negative comments from people around the country. some were baffled that the Rossler massacre, which occurred around the same time of Selena's death, did not generate the same amount of media exposure. Mayor Mary Rhodes said many of the people complaining about the media exposure Selena was receiving had never heard of her.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the parts}} of Lagoas and Kuusamo which {{were part of the}} empire, Kaunians {{disappeared}} completely. In the more westward parts of the continent, in contrast, Kaunians became an ethnic minority in countries formed by the invading [...] "barbarians": maintaining a distinct and largely separate <b>minority</b> <b>culture,</b> keeping the ancient language in more or less its original form as their daily speech, clinging to the short tunics and trousers common in the days of Empire, and frowning at the idea of mixed marriages. The wearing of trousers by the Kaunian women tends to be a distraction for other peoples, as the tight pants reveal more than the more modern knee-length tunics do. This often results in Kaunian women being regarded as sexually promiscuous - a widespread racial stereotype which is deliberately used by King Mezentio in fomenting hatred of Kaunians.|$|E
2500|$|What {{happened}} to the indigenous Brittonic people is also subject to question. Heinrich Härke and Richard Coates point out that they are invisible archaeologically and linguistically. But based on a fairly high Anglo-Saxon figure (200,000) and a low Brythonic one (800,000), Brythonic {{people are likely to}} have outnumbered Anglo-Saxons by at least four to one. The interpretation of such figures is that while [...] "culturally, the later Anglo-Saxons and English did emerge as remarkably un-British, [...] [...] [...] their genetic, biological make-up is none the less likely to have been substantially, indeed predominantly, British". The development of Anglo-Saxon culture is described by two processes. One is similar to culture changes observed in Russia, North Africa and parts of the Islamic world, where a powerful <b>minority</b> <b>culture</b> becomes, over a rather short period, adopted by a settled majority.|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the values issue in the South African context, a multicultural education situation. South Africa is a pluralistic society. Being pluralistic, means that the country is rich in different cultures, belief- and value systems. Different cultures have different value systems. If an institution is practising multicultural education, the question is, which values are to be used? If we say the institution should use the values of the majority culture, will that not disadvantage <b>minority</b> <b>cultures?</b> If <b>minority</b> <b>cultures</b> are undermined by neglecting their cultures won't that cause conflict between <b>minority</b> <b>cultures</b> and the majority culture? Each society that is implementing multicultural education should consider that there are common human values and particular values. In multicultural education particular values are important because they show how a particular group behaves and what its beliefs and culture are. Common values develop from particular values and teachers must emphasise common values without neglecting particular values, to encourag...|$|R
2500|$|The {{majority}} of the population of Hohhot are Han Chinese, representing 87.16 {{percent of the total population}} in 2010. Most Han in Hohhot, if their ancestry is traced several decades back, have ancestors from Shanxi, northeast China, or Hebei. Most Mongols in the city speak Chinese. A survey from 1993 of the Inner Mongolia University found that only 8 percent of Tümed Mongols (the majority tribe in Hohhot) could speak the Mongolian language. A significant portion of the population is of mixed ethnic origin. According to the anthropologist William Jankowiak, who wrote the book Sex, Death, and Hierarchy in a Chinese City (1993) about Huhehot, there is [...] "relatively little different between <b>minority</b> <b>culture</b> and Han culture" [...] in the city. with differences concentrating around minor attributes like food and art choices, and similarities abounding over fundamental issues in ethics, status, life goals, and worldview.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} views on Deaf people. There is a Medical View, a view {{commonly}} associated with doctors and encouraging a Deaf child's parents that they should undergo surgery. They may even {{go as far as}} to urge parents not to learn sign language believing that it will distract the Deaf child from developing his/her auditory and speech skills. The Social view welcomes Deaf individuals into the hearing world and provides Deaf people with accommodations such as interpreters. Detractors of this view argue this fails to recognize the unique situation Deaf children are in; rather than attempting to understand Deaf culture, people with this view feel as though it is the duty of the Deaf individual to find their own way into a predominantly hearing society. Finally, there is the cultural-linguistic view. Supporters of deaf culture argue this appropriately recognizes Deaf people as a <b>minority</b> <b>culture</b> in the world with their own language, social norms, and culture, and promotes Deaf people's right to collective space within society to pass on their language and culture to future generations. Being involved in the Deaf community and culturally identifying as Deaf has been shown to significantly contribute to positive self-esteem in Deaf individuals. This community provides support, easy social interaction, and a [...] "refuge from the grinding frustrations of the hearing world." [...] Conversely, Deaf individuals who are {{not a part of the}} Deaf community are forced to conform to the hearing world, resulting in lower self-esteem.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} answer the following question: does a commitment to liberalism require state remediation of illiberal practices of illiberal <b>minority</b> <b>cultures</b> that only affect their own members? Put differently, it asks: should the state deny illiberal <b>minority</b> <b>cultures</b> such as those of the Amish, Ultra-Orthodox Jews, Pueblo Indians, et cetera the freedom to be internally illiberal from a liberal viewpoint? The answer proposed by this dissertation is a qualified ‘no’. Assuming that liberalism is fundamentally committed to the protection of individual freedom, I argue that states should allow illiberal <b>minority</b> <b>cultures</b> to be internally illiberal in order to respect the individual freedom of citizens with illiberal conceptions of the good. At the same time, I propose limits to this toleration {{in order to protect the}} individual freedom of (more) progressive-minded citizens, as well as to guard children from severely harmful cultural practices. Whether the state should tolerate illiberal practices of illiberal <b>minority</b> <b>cultures</b> that only affect their own members, I claim, should depend on whether the following conditions are met: (i) Their adult members are guaranteed substantive exit rights, i. e. rights to a realistic ability to change cultural affiliations. (ii) The cultural communities in question do not engage in illiberal practices that inflict severe harm on children. To realise condition (i), which forms the core of this dissertation’s ‘substantive exit rights strategy’, I argue that the state should take five measures. These include making an autonomy-facilitating education compulsorily for children, providing particular groups of defectors with financial assistance, and ensuring that the liberal majority culture is open to ex-members of illiberal <b>minority</b> <b>cultures.</b> By contrast, condition (ii) is not considered to be central to this dissertation’s substantive exit rights strategy, the reason being that it is dubious whether liberalism’s core commitment to the protection of individual freedom alone can justify a ban on cultural practices that severely harm children. Even so, it will become clear that adding this condition renders this approach more plausible. My central claim is that this dissertation’s substantive exit rights strategy better protects the individual freedom of members of illiberal <b>minority</b> <b>cultures</b> than the main rival liberal strategies, as proposed by Will Kymlicka and Chandran Kukathas. Whereas Kymlicka gives members of these groups too little liberty to engage in illiberal practices, I argue that Kukathas makes the opposite mistake of granting them too much liberty. In both cases, we will see that the individual freedom of some members of illiberal <b>minority</b> <b>cultures</b> is not appropriately protected. This holds true, I conclude, regardless of whether individual freedom is construed as personal autonomy or in a less demanding way, namely as ability to live (autonomously or non-autonomously) in accordance with one’s conception of the good...|$|R

This paper explores social networking across three cultures, (one dominant <b>culture</b> and two <b>minority)</b> allowing the researcher an insight into entrepreneurial networking in three very different cultures.
