The objective of the review is to determine that this system satisfies the requirements of GDC 5, 17, and 18, and will perform its design functions during all plant operating and accident conditions. The offsite power system is referred to in industry standards and regulatory guides as the "preferred power system.

5000|$|It {{is called}} [...] "Trapped Key" [...] as it works by {{releasing}} and trapping keys in a predetermined sequence. After the control or {{power has been}} isolated, a key is released {{that can be used}} to grant access to individual or multiple doors. For example, to prevent access to the inside of an electric kiln, a trapped key system may be used to interlock a <b>disconnecting</b> <b>switch</b> and the kiln door. While the switch is turned on, the key is held by the interlock attached to the <b>disconnecting</b> <b>switch.</b> To open the kiln door, the switch is first opened, which releases the key. The key can then be used to unlock the kiln door. While the key is removed from the switch interlock, a plunger from the interlock mechanically prevents the switch from closing.

In this paper we discuss such interruptions and their necessity. We present fast measurements of voltage and current at the GIS/cable-interface of a 150 kV substation, where the enclosure is interrupted to permit current measurement. Circuit breaker operation causes a single voltage transient across the interruption with an amplitude up to 40 kV, a duration of 200 - 300 ns, and a risetime of about 5 ns. <b>Disconnect</b> <b>switch</b> operation causes multiple transients. each having a smaller amplitude and a longer risetime.

50|$|In {{a common}} design, {{incoming}} lines have a <b>disconnect</b> <b>switch</b> and a circuit breaker.

A <b>disconnect</b> <b>switch</b> is used to provide isolation, since it cannot interrupt load current. A circuit breaker {{is used as a}} protection device to interrupt fault currents automatically, and may be used to switch loads on and off, or to cut off a line when power is flowing in the 'wrong' direction. When a large fault current flows through the circuit breaker, this is detected through the use of current transformers. The magnitude of the current transformer outputs may be used to trip the circuit breaker resulting in a disconnection of the load supplied by the circuit break from the feeding point. This seeks to isolate the fault point {{from the rest of the}} system, and allow the rest of the system to continue operating with minimal impact.
