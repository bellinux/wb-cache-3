5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nucleus {{is derived}} from the basal plate of the embryonic <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata.</b>|$|E
5|$|Information {{from the}} {{peripheral}} chemoreceptors is relayed {{to a series}} of interconnected nuclei which comprise the respiratory centres in the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata</b> and the pons of the brainstem. This information determines the average rate of ventilation of the alveoli of the lungs, to keep the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood constant. The respiratory centre does so via motor neurons which activate the muscles of respiration (in particular the diaphragm).|$|E
5|$|The partial {{pressures}} of oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the arterial blood are measured by the peripheral chemoreceptors – the aortic and carotid bodies, and the central chemoreceptors of the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata</b> of the brainstem. The peripheral chemoreceptors are more sensitive to the arterial partial pressure of oxygen than they are to the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The central chemoreceptor is particularly sensitive to the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid, which is directly influenced by the partial pressure of {{carbon dioxide in the}} arterial blood.|$|E
5|$|Neuroanatomists usually {{divide the}} {{vertebrate}} brain into six main regions: the telencephalon (cerebral hemispheres), diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus), mesencephalon (midbrain), cerebellum, pons, and <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata.</b> Each {{of these areas}} has a complex internal structure. Some parts, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar cortex, consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within the available space. Other parts, such as the thalamus and hypothalamus, consist of clusters of many small nuclei. Thousands of distinguishable areas can be identified within the vertebrate brain based on fine distinctions of neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity.|$|E
5|$|The fibres {{that form}} the spinal {{accessory}} nerve are formed by lower motor neurons located in the upper segments of the spinal cord. This cluster of neurons, called the spinal accessory nucleus, {{is located in the}} lateral aspect of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, and stretches from where the spinal cord begins (at the junction with the medulla) through to the level of about C6. The lateral horn of high cervical segments appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata,</b> from which the cranial component of the accessory nerve is derived.|$|E
5|$|The heart {{receives}} nerve {{signals from}} the vagus nerve and from nerves arising from the sympathetic trunk. These nerves act to influence, but not control, the heart rate. Sympathetic nerves also influence the force of heart contraction. Signals that travel along these nerves arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata.</b> The vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system acts to decrease the heart rate, and nerves from the sympathetic trunk act to increase the heart rate. These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called the cardiac plexus.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the fourth}} week the cephalic part bends sharply forward in a cephalic flexure. This flexed part becomes the {{forebrain}} (prosencephalon); the adjoining curving part becomes the midbrain (mesencephalon) and the part caudal to the flexure becomes the hindbrain (rhombencephalon). In the fifth week of developmement five brain vesicles have formed. The forebrain separates into two vesicles an anterior telencephalon and a posterior diencephalon. The telencephalon {{gives rise to the}} cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures. The diencephalon gives rise to the thalamus and hypothalamus. The hindbrain also splits into two areas – the metencephalon and the mylencephalon. The metencephalon gives rise to the cerebellum and pons. The myelencephalon gives rise to the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata.</b> Also during the fifth week, the brain divides into repeating segments called neuromeres. These are known as rhombomeres seen in the hindbrain.|$|E
5|$|The fibres of {{the spinal}} {{accessory}} nerve originate solely in neurons {{situated in the}} upper spinal cord, from where the spinal cord begins at the junction with the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata,</b> {{to the level of}} about C6. These fibres join together to form rootlets, roots, and finally the spinal accessory nerve itself. The formed nerve enters the skull through the foramen magnum, the large opening at the skull's base. The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards the jugular foramen. Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through the jugular foramen with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The spinal accessory nerve is notable for being the only cranial nerve to both enter and exit the skull. This is due to it being unique among the cranial nerves in having neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} {{is connected}} by the brainstem to the spinal cord. The brainstem {{consists of the}} midbrain, the pons, and the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata.</b> The cerebellum {{is connected to the}} brainstem by pairs of tracts. Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system, consisting of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. Underneath the cerebral cortex are several important structures, including the thalamus, the epithalamus, the pineal gland, the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the subthalamus; the limbic structures, including the amygdala and the hippocampus; the claustrum, the various nuclei of the basal ganglia; the basal forebrain structures, and the three circumventricular organs. The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells. There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain, and a more or less equal number of other cells. Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons and their release of neurotransmitters in response to nerve impulses. Neurons form elaborate neural networks of neural pathways and circuits. The whole circuitry is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
5|$|For vertebrates, {{the early}} stages of neural {{development}} are similar across all species. As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate, the precursor of the nervous system. The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the diencephalon (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will contain the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata).</b> Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.|$|E
5|$|There is {{speculation}} {{of several}} {{mechanisms by which}} the brain cells could be lost. One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. This insoluble protein accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called Lewy bodies. According to the Braak staging, a classification of the disease based on pathological findings, Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory bulb, <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata</b> and pontine tegmentum; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain and, finally, the neocortex. These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD; however, Lewy bodies may not cause cell death {{and they may be}} protective (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g., oligomers) that are not aggregated in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites may actually be the toxic forms of the protein. In people with dementia, a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas. Neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, are not common unless the person is demented.|$|E
25|$|Cardiovascular control – The reticular {{formation}} includes the cardiac and vasomotor {{centers of the}} <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} diagnosis relies on histopathological examination of the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata</b> of the brain, and other tissues, post mortem. Immunohistochemistry {{can be used to}} demonstrate prion protein accumulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{pyramidal}} tracts {{are named}} because {{they pass through}} the pyramids of the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata.</b> The corticospinal fibers when descending from the internal capsule to the brain stem, converge to a point from multiple directions giving the impression of an inverted pyramid.|$|E
25|$|The {{breathing}} rate increases when the partial pressure {{of carbon dioxide}} in the blood increases. This is detected by central blood gas chemoreceptors on the anterior surface of the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata.</b> The aortic and carotid bodies, are the peripheral blood gas chemoreceptors which are particularly sensitive to the arterial partial pressure of O2 though they also respond, but less strongly, to the partial pressure of CO2. At sea level, under normal circumstances, the {{breathing rate}} and depth, is determined primarily by the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide rather than by the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, which is allowed to vary within a fairly wide range before the respiratory centers in the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata</b> and pons respond to it to change the rate and depth of breathing.|$|E
25|$|The reticular {{formation}} {{is a set}} of interconnected nuclei that are located throughout the brainstem. The {{reticular formation}} is not anatomically well defined because it includes neurons located in diverse parts of the brain. The neurons of the reticular formation make up a complex set of networks in the core of the brainstem that stretches from {{the upper part of the}} midbrain to the lower part of the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata.</b> The reticular formation includes ascending pathways to the cortex in the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) and descending pathways to the spinal cord via the reticulospinal tracts of the descending reticular formation.|$|E
25|$|The {{heart rate}} is rhythmically {{generated}} by the sinoatrial node. It is also influenced by central factors through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. Nervous influence over the heartrate is centralized within the two paired cardiovascular centres of the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata.</b> The cardioaccelerator regions stimulate activity via sympathetic stimulation of the cardioaccelerator nerves, and the cardioinhibitory centers decrease heart activity via parasympathetic stimulation as one component of the vagus nerve. During rest, both centers provide slight stimulation to the heart, contributing to autonomic tone. This is a similar concept to tone in skeletal muscles. Normally, vagal stimulation predominates as, left unregulated, the SA node would initiate a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm.|$|E
25|$|REM atonia, {{an almost}} {{complete}} paralysis of the body, is accomplished through the inhibition of motor neurons. When the body shifts into REM sleep, motor neurons {{throughout the body}} undergo a process called hyperpolarization: their already-negative membrane potential decreases by another 2–10 millivolts, thereby raising the threshold which a stimulus must overcome to excite them. Muscle inhibition may result from unavailability of monoamine neurotransmitters (restraining the abundance of acetylcholine in the brainstem) and perhaps from mechanisms used in waking muscle inhibition. The <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata,</b> located between pons and spine, {{seems to have the}} capacity for organism-wide muscle inhibition. Some localized twitching and reflexes can still occur. Pupils contract.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{involves}} {{removal of}} the etiologic mass and decompressive craniectomy. Brain herniation can cause severe disability or death. In fact, when herniation is visible on a CT scan, the prognosis for a meaningful recovery of neurological function is poor. The patient may become paralyzed {{on the same side}} as the lesion causing the pressure, or damage to parts of the brain caused by herniation may cause paralysis on the side opposite the lesion. Damage to the midbrain, which contains the reticular activating network which regulates consciousness, will result in coma. Damage to the cardio-respiratory centers in the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata</b> will cause respiratory arrest and (secondarily) cardiac arrest. Current investigation is underway regarding the use of neuroprotective agents during the prolonged post-traumatic period of brain hypersensitivity associated with the syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Freud {{began his}} study of {{medicine}} at the University of Vienna in 1873. He took almost nine years to complete his studies, due to his interest in neurophysiological research, specifically investigation of the sexual anatomy of eels and the physiology of the fish nervous system, and because of his interest in studying philosophy with Franz Brentano. He entered private practice in neurology for financial reasons, receiving his M.D. degree in 1881 at the age of 25. Amongst his principal concerns in the 1880s was the anatomy of the brain, specifically the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata.</b> He intervened in the important debates about aphasia with his monograph of 1891, Zur Auffassung der Aphasien, in which he coined the term agnosia and counselled against a too locationist view of the explanation of neurological deficits. Like his contemporary Eugen Bleuler, he emphasized brain function rather than brain structure.|$|E
500|$|The brainstem, {{resembling}} a stalk, attaches to {{and leaves the}} cerebrum {{at the start of}} the midbrain area. The brainstem includes the midbrain, the pons, and the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata.</b> Behind the brainstem is the cerebellum (...) [...]|$|E
500|$|Frogs have {{a highly}} {{developed}} nervous system {{that consists of}} a brain, spinal cord and nerves. Many parts of frog brains correspond with those of humans. It consists of two olfactory lobes, two cerebral hemispheres, a pineal body, two optic lobes, a cerebellum and a <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata.</b> Muscular coordination and posture are controlled by the cerebellum, and the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata</b> regulates respiration, digestion and other automatic functions. The relative size of the cerebrum in frogs is much smaller {{than it is in}} humans. Frogs have ten pairs of cranial nerves which pass information from the outside directly to the brain, and ten pairs of spinal nerves which pass information from the extremities to the brain through the spinal cord. [...] By contrast, all amniotes (mammals, birds and reptiles) have twelve pairs of cranial nerves.|$|E
500|$|The modern {{rediscovery of}} CSF is now {{credited}} to Emanuel Swedenborg. In a manuscript written between 1741 and 1744, unpublished in his lifetime, Swedenborg referred to CSF as [...] "spirituous lymph" [...] secreted {{from the roof}} of the fourth ventricle down to the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata</b> and spinal cord. This manuscript was eventually published in translation in 1887.|$|E
500|$|In 1848, Jones Quain {{described}} the nerve as the [...] "spinal nerve accessory to the vagus", recognizing that while a minor {{component of the}} nerve joins with the larger vagus nerve, the majority of accessory nerve fibres originate in the spinal cord. In 1893 it was recognised that the heretofore named nerve fibres [...] "accessory" [...] to the vagus originated from the same nucleus in the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata,</b> and it came to pass that these fibres were increasingly viewed {{as part of the}} vagus nerve itself. Consequently, the term [...] "accessory nerve" [...] was and is increasingly used to denote only fibres from the spinal cord; the fact that only the spinal portion could be tested clinically lent weight to this opinion.|$|E
500|$|The {{nervous system}} is {{basically}} {{the same as in}} other vertebrates, with a central brain, a spinal cord, and nerves throughout the body. The amphibian brain is less well developed than that of reptiles, birds and mammals but is similar in morphology and function to that of a fish. It is believed amphibians are capable of perceiving pain. [...] The brain consists of equal parts, cerebrum, midbrain and cerebellum. Various parts of the cerebrum process sensory input, such as smell in the olfactory lobe and sight in the optic lobe, and it is additionally the centre of behaviour and learning. The cerebellum is the center of muscular coordination and the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata</b> controls some organ functions including heartbeat and respiration. The brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity {{in the rest of the}} body. The pineal body, known to regulate sleep patterns in humans, is thought to produce the hormones involved in hibernation and aestivation in amphibians.|$|E
500|$|Purkinje cells {{also receive}} {{input from the}} {{inferior}} olivary nucleus on the contralateral side of the brainstem via climbing fibers. Although the inferior olive lies in the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata</b> and receives input from the spinal cord, brainstem and cerebral cortex, its output goes entirely to the cerebellum. A climbing fiber gives off collaterals to the deep cerebellar nuclei before entering the cerebellar cortex, where it splits into about 10 terminal branches, each of which gives input to a single Purkinje cell. In striking contrast to the 100,000-plus inputs from parallel fibers, each Purkinje cell receives input from exactly one climbing fiber; but this single fiber [...] "climbs" [...] the dendrites of the Purkinje cell, winding around them and making a total of up to 300 synapses as it goes. The net input {{is so strong that}} a single action potential from a climbing fiber is capable of producing an extended complex spike in the Purkinje cell: a burst of several spikes in a row, with diminishing amplitude, followed by a pause during which activity is suppressed. The climbing fiber synapses cover the cell body and proximal dendrites; this zone is devoid of parallel fiber inputs.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{pyramidal}} tracts {{refers to}} {{upper motor neurons}} that originate in the cerebral cortex and terminate in the spinal cord (corticospinal) or brainstem (corticobulbar). Nerves emerge in the cerebral cortex, pass down and may cross sides in the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata,</b> and travel {{as part of the}} spinal cord until they synapse with interneurons in the grey column of the spinal cord.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, {{there have}} been a variety of terms used for the disorder, {{including}} pseudobulbar affect, pathological laughter and crying, emotional lability, emotionalism, emotional dysregulation, or more recently, involuntary emotional expression disorder. The term pseudobulbar ( [...] + [...] ) came from the idea that the symptoms seemed similar to those caused by a bulbar lesion (that is, a lesion in the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Brain {{herniation}} frequently presents with abnormal posturing {{a characteristic}} {{positioning of the}} limbs indicative of severe brain damage. [...] These patients have a lowered level of consciousness, with Glasgow Coma Scores of three to five. One or both pupils may be dilated and fail to constrict in response to light. Vomiting can also occur due to compression of the vomiting center in the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The four {{cavities}} of {{the human}} brain are called ventricles. The two largest are the lateral ventricles in the cerebrum; the third ventricle is in the diencephalon of the forebrain between the right and left thalamus; and the fourth ventricle is located {{at the back of the}} pons and upper half of the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata</b> of the hindbrain. The ventricles are concerned with the production and circulation of cerebrospinal fluid ...|$|E
2500|$|Granisetron is a {{serotonin}} 5-HT3 receptor antagonist {{used as an}} antiemetic {{to treat}} nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy. Its main effect {{is to reduce the}} activity of the vagus nerve, which is a nerve that activates the vomiting center in the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata.</b> [...] It does not have much effect on vomiting due to motion sickness. [...] This drug does not have any effect on dopamine receptors or muscarinic receptors.|$|E
2500|$|The corticospinal tract conducts impulses {{from the}} brain to the spinal cord. It {{is made up of}} a lateral and {{anterior}} tract. The corticospinal tract is involved in voluntary movement. The majority of fibres of the corticospinal tract cross over in the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata,</b> resulting in muscles being controlled by {{the opposite side of the}} brain. The corticospinal tract also contains Betz cells (the largest pyramidal cells), which are not found in any other region of the body.|$|E
2500|$|Nerve fibres in the corticospinal tract {{originate}} from pyramidal cells in layer V of the cerebral cortex. Fibres {{arise from the}} primary motor cortex (about 30%), supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex (together also about 30%), and the somatosensory cortex, parietal lobe, and cingulate gyrus supplies the rest. The cells have their bodies in the cerebral cortex, and the axons form {{the bulk of the}} pyramidal tracts. [...] The nerve axons travel from the cortex through the posterior limb of internal capsule, through the cerebral peduncle and into the brainstem and anterior <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata.</b> Here they form two prominences called the medulla oblongatary pyramids. Below the prominences, the majority of axons cross over to the opposite side from which they originated, known as decussation. The axons that cross over move to the outer part of the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata</b> and form the lateral corticospinal tract, whereas the fibres that remain form the anterior corticospinal tract. [...] About 80% of axons cross over and form the lateral corticospinal tract; 10% do not cross over and join the tract, and 10% of fibres travel in the anterior corticospinal tract.|$|E
2500|$|Ventilation of {{the lungs}} in mammals occurs via the {{respiratory}} centers in the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata</b> and the pons of the brainstem. These areas form a series of neural pathways which receive information about the partial pressures of oxygen and {{carbon dioxide in the}} arterial blood. [...] This information determines the average rate of ventilation of the alveoli {{of the lungs}}, to keep these pressures constant. The respiratory center does so via motor nerves which activate the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration.|$|E
2500|$|Often these {{comparisons}} carried {{hints of}} humor, competitiveness, or both. The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, for example, termed Gage [...] "the patient whose cerebral organism had been comparatively so little disturbed by its abrupt and intrusive visitor"; and a Kentucky doctor, reporting a patient's survival of a gunshot through the nose, bragged, [...] "If you Yankees {{can send a}} tamping bar through a fellow's brain and not kill him, I guess {{there are not many}} can shoot a bullet between a man's mouth and his brains, stopping just short of the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata,</b> and not touch either." ...|$|E
2500|$|The nerve axons {{traveling}} {{down the}} tract {{are referred to}} as efferent nerve fibers of the upper motor neurons. These axons travel down the tracts in the white matter of the spinal cord until they reach the vertebral level of the muscle that they will innervate. At this point, the axons synapse with lower motor neurons. The majority of axons do not directly synapse with lower motor neurons, but instead synapse with an interneuron that then synapses with a lower motor neuron. This generally occurs in the anterior grey column. Nerve axons of the lateral corticospinal tract that did not cross over in the <b>medulla</b> <b>oblongata</b> do so {{at the level of the}} spinal cord they terminate in.|$|E
