However, none of the have consider the interaction among the <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> when examining the relationship. In management and behavioural researches it is well established that Structural Equation Modelling can handle the problem of interaction among the variables. Therefore, we have decided to use Structural equation modelling to identify the complex inter-relations between the corporate governance <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> We conclude that there is a possibility of having a substitution or complementary links among <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> which explains why there is no consistent empirical evidence between individual <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and firm performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} {{and knowledge of}} <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and organizational attributes are useful to the management, shareholders, government, regulatory and enforcement agents, board of directors, internal and external auditors and {{the public at large}} in any community. The knowledge of this subject matter has been on the rise because of its ability to resolve agency problems in organizations. The main objective of this paper is therefore to consider the conceptual and theoretical relationship between the organizational attributes and <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> as related to non-financial publicly listed companies in Nigeria. The study will also establish the impact of organizational attributes and <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on the opportunistic attitudes of management with consideration of the implementation level of <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in the non-financial listed companies in Nigeria. There is a need for more research on the <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> highlighted in the Nigerian code of corporate governance. This need is due to the scarcity of research on the relationship between organizational attributes and <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in an emerging economy like Nigeria. The convergence to IFRS, which commenced of recent, also makes it a necessity to understand <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and organizational attributes...|$|R

25|$|Also in January 2017, Lt.

When the {{government}} consequently arrested four suspects, they declared that Issa had been killed by Machar's followers. Clashes took place directly west of Wau town during the night between 30 and 31 January, when a SPLA patrol encountered a group of rebels by chance.

25|$|Although artisanal logging {{provides}} some {{income for the}} community in the short-run, it ultimately does not improve local living conditions. In the end, the communities receive payments which are not large {{enough to cover the}} loss of their natural resources. Since there is no <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanism,</b> the loggers report lower harvested amounts than they actually do in order to pay less tax to the local government. Some loggers cut one tree within the woods and leave the rest intact to mimic natural disturbance. To improve the situation, the DRC government needs better monitoring and better forest code to manage the logging activities.|$|E

The examination system {{at the end of}} preparatory and secondary levels—Thanaweyya Amma, does not measure higher-order thinking skills, but concentrates rather on rote memorization. Scores can thus be raised significantly by exam specific tutoring, therefore, students with more resources can afford private tutoring which helps them to score higher on the national standardized exams and hence are accepted in top universities in Egypt. Hence, this competitive process of selection restricts students’ degree options and results, hence making students opt for programs and careers which are of little interest to them.|$|E
40|$|Corporate {{governance}} still {{becomes a}} major issue during the post-financial crisis period in Asian emerging market, such as Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines and Malaysia. Particularly, the financial institutions have implemented corporate governance reforms to enhance the protection of shareholders and stakeholders interest. The consequences emerge as it allows for greater monitoring especially by the shareholders. The objective {{of this study is}} to measure the corporate governance and performance in banking sectors in particular, which is determining by the corporate governance mechanisms. In the last part, this study attempts to identify whether there exist any differences in the <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of banking firms and non-banking firms. This study found that only the foreign shareholder which is represent of the ownerships <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are significantly negatively related with corporate performance measures in the banking firms in Asian emerging markets. Second, the Internal Control <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Mechanisms</b> showed the insignificant relationship with corporate performance, but only one of the internal control <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> which is CEO duality provides evidence in order to explain the relationship better.

Based on survey data of 160 export ventures in China, we find that process control increases distributor opportunism, while norm-based information exchange and MO decrease it. Moreover, at high levels of norm-based information exchange and MO, the impact of process control on opportunism turns from positive to negative.

40|$|<b>Monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are {{tools for}} {{companies}} to protect {{the interests of the}} shareholders, most especially, the minority shareholders from the deviant behaviour of the management and board members. This study examines the relationship between <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (directorship, internal and external auditing), gender and information system structure in Nigerian non-financial listed companies. The empirical tests for the study are by quantitative analysis approach with data from annual reports and questionnaires (for information system structure and internal auditing not obtainable from annual reports). The findings reveal that both gender and information system structure significantly relates to <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (directorship, internal auditing and external auditing). This empirical study adds to the literature on the antecedents of organizational attributes in respect of gender and information system structure as related to <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> particularly in Sub-Saharan African. Likewise, the findings suggest policy implication for the board of directors regarding appropriate board composition and structuring of the information system of a company to mitigate agency problems...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} titled Impact {{of international}} human rights <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in Kenya explores {{the influence of the}} findings of international <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in Kenya. The research demonstrates that the findings have had limited impact on national legislation, executive policy, court decisions and the constitution making process. Further, the research illustrates that the key factors accounting for impact of the findings of <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are internalisation in the political, legal and social order, domestic structures and processes and non-state actors. In addition, the research explores the limited impact of the findings despite their legal internalisation through the Kenya Constitution, 2010 and demonstrates that it is as a result of incomplete internalisation in the political and social order. The research adds to existing literature on impact of {{international human rights}} <b>monitoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and also to the literature on state compliance with international law through theory testing.
