5000|$|A lunar base {{could be}} a site for {{launching}} rockets with locally <b>manufactured</b> <b>fuel</b> to distant planets such as Mars. Launching rockets from the Moon would be easier than from Earth because the Moon's gravity is lower, requiring a lower escape velocity.

50|$|Pilot Industries was an American {{company that}} {{developed}} and <b>manufactured</b> <b>fuel</b> and fluid handling systems {{primarily for the}} automotive industry. Other products included non-destructive test systems and injection molding equipment. Established in 1977, Pilot's corporate headquarters were in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with technical centers in Dexter, Michigan and in the UK. Manufacturing facilities were located in Dexter, Michigan (2 plants); Manchester, Michigan; Clare, Michigan; Reed City, Michigan; Sterling Heights, Michigan; North Vernon, Indiana; Born, Netherlands; and Saltillo, Mexico.|$|E

5000|$|The site's {{previous}} {{industrial use}} {{was for the}} Welch and Griffith saw factory, {{the first in the}} United States. This complex burned down in 1913. The complex was built in 1914 to house the Arlington Gas Company, which <b>manufactured</b> <b>fuel</b> for home use. It originally included a large storage tank, on top of which was emblazoned [...] "ARLINGTON" [...] and an arrow pointing north; {{this was one of the}} earliest known aids to aerial navigation, and was torn down in 1975. The complex now serves as the town's public works yard.|$|E
50|$|The 100th Bomber Group of the US Eighth Air Force, {{stationed}} at RAF Thorpe Abbotts in England, approached {{the area in}} a formation of 36 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers. The aircraft flew at great height over Germany and initially without being escorted by fighters. Their target was the Schwarzheide Synthesis Factory (Synthesewerk Schwarzheide) between Dresden and Cottbus. In addition, several aircraft were to drop their bomb loads over the Sudetenland fuel factory at Maltheuern near Br√ºx. The synthetics factory was frequently a target for Allied bombing because it <b>manufactured</b> <b>fuel</b> from coal, something that was important to the war effort.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1890s, {{pipelines}} {{from natural}} gas fields in Texas and Oklahoma were built to Chicago and other cities, {{and natural gas}} was used to supplement <b>manufactured</b> <b>fuel</b> gas supplies, eventually completely displacing it. Gas ceased to be manufactured in North America by 1966 (with the exception of Indianapolis and Honolulu), while it continued in Europe until the 1980s. [...] "Manufactured gas" [...] is again being evaluated as a fuel source, as energy utilities look towards coal gasification once again as a potentially cleaner way of generating power from coal, although nowadays such gases {{are likely to be}} called [...] "synthetic natural gas".|$|E

50|$|Rochester Products Division (RPD) was a {{division}} of General Motors that manufactured carburetors, and related components including emissions control devices and cruise control systems in Rochester, New York. In 1995 Rochester became part of Delphi, which in turn became a separate company four years later, and continues to <b>manufacture</b> <b>fuel</b> injection systems in Rochester, now part of General Motors Automotive Components Holdings- Rochester Operations.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the <b>manufactured</b> <b>fuel</b> gas {{industry}} diversified out of lighting and into heat and cooking. The threat from electrical light in the later 1870s and 1880s drove this trend strongly. The gas industry did not cede the gas lighting market to electricity immediately, as the invention of the Welsbach mantle, a refractory mesh bag heated to incandescence by a mostly non-luminous flame within, dramatically increased the efficiency of gas lighting. Acetylene was also used from about 1898 for gas cooking and gas lighting (see Carbide lamp) on a smaller scale, although its use too declined with the advent of electric lighting, and LPG for cooking. Other technological developments in the late nineteenth century include the use of water gas and machine stoking, although these were not universally adopted.|$|E
5000|$|Carbon dioxide, hydrogen, nitrous oxide, oxygen, ammonia, {{chlorine}}, {{sulfur dioxide}} and <b>manufactured</b> <b>fuel</b> gas were already being {{used during the}} 19th century, and mainly had uses in food, refrigeration, medicine, and for fuel and gas lighting. For example, carbonated water was being made from 1772 and commercially from 1783, chlorine was first used to bleach textiles in 1785 [...] and nitrous oxide was first used for dentistry anaethesia in 1844. At this time gases were often generated for immediate use by chemical reactions. A notable example of a generator is Kipps apparatus which was invented in 1844 [...] and {{could be used to}} generate gases such as hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, chlorine, acetylene and carbon dioxide by simple gas evolution reactions. Acetylene was manufactured commercially from 1893 and acetylene generators were used from about 1898 to produce gas for gas cooking and gas lighting, however electricity took over as more practical for lighting and once LPG was produced commercially from 1912, the use of acetylene for cooking declined.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} {{manufactured}} gas, important for lighting, heating, and cooking purposes {{throughout most of}} the 19th century and {{the first half of the}} 20th century, began with the development of analytical and pneumatic chemistry in the 18th century. The manufacturing process for [...] "synthetic fuel gases" [...] (also known as [...] "manufactured fuel gas", [...] "manufactured gas" [...] or simply [...] "gas") typically consisted of the gasification of combustible materials, usually coal, but also wood and oil. The coal was gasified by heating the coal in enclosed ovens with an oxygen-poor atmosphere. The fuel gases generated were mixtures of many chemical substances, including hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide and ethylene, and could be burnt for heating and lighting purposes. Coal gas, for example, also contains significant quantities of unwanted sulfur and ammonia compounds, as well as heavy hydrocarbons, and so the <b>manufactured</b> <b>fuel</b> gases needed to be purified before they could be used.|$|E

50|$|The first {{attempts}} to <b>manufacture</b> <b>fuel</b> gas {{in a commercial}} way {{were made in the}} period 1795-1805 in France by Philippe Lebon, and in England by William Murdoch. Although precursors can be found, it was these two engineers who elaborated the technology with commercial applications in mind. Frederick Winsor was the key player behind the creation of the first gas utility, the London-based Gas Light and Coke Company, incorporated by royal charter in April 1812.|$|R

40|$|The {{treatment}} of spent fuel produced in nuclear power generation {{is one of}} the most important issues to both the nuclear community and the general public. One of the viable options to long-term geological disposal of spent fuel is to extract plutonium, minor actinides (MA), and potentially long-lived fission products from the spent fuel and transmute them into short-lived or stable radionuclides in currently operating light-water reactors (LWR), thus reducing the radiological toxicity of the nuclear waste stream. One of the challenges is to demonstrate that the burnup-dependent characteristic differences between Reactor-Grade Mixed Oxide (RG-MOX) fuel and RG-MOX fuel with MA Np- 237 and Am 241 are minimal, particularly, the inert gas generation rate, such that the commercial MOX fuel experience base is applicable. Under the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI), developmental fuel specimens in experimental assembly LWR- 2 are being tested in the northwest (NW) I- 24 irradiation position of the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR). The experiment uses MOX fuel test hardware, and contains capsules with MOX fuel consisting of mixed oxide <b>manufactured</b> <b>fuel</b> using reactor grade plutonium (RG-Pu) and mixed oxide <b>manufactured</b> <b>fuel</b> using RG-Pu with added Np/Am. This study will compare the fuel neutronics depletion characteristics of Case- 1 RG-MOX and Case- 2 RG-MOX with Np/Am...|$|E
40|$|Natural Resources Engineering Project - ENNR 425 This report {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of Hot Rocks as a <b>manufactured</b> <b>fuel</b> for domestic use in Christchurch. It examines both the environmental and economic comparisons of Hot Rocks against other fuels such as wood and coal. The major topics covered include: ‚Ä¢ The present situation in Christchurch, focussing on air pollution and its effects ‚Ä¢ Regulations that are in place, or proposed concerning domestic solid fuel burners ‚Ä¢ The method of production of Hot Rocks ‚Ä¢ A desktop correlation in order to estimate emission levels of Hot Rocks in burners meeting future requirements ‚Ä¢ A comparative study of combustion properties and economics between wood and Hot Rocks ‚Ä¢ Steps {{that need to be}} taken to ensure the viability of Hot Rocks as a <b>manufactured</b> <b>fuel.</b> There are advantages to be gained through utilising manufactured fuels such as Hot Rocks, produced from waste products for domestic purposes. Waste that would otherwise be sent to a landfill is recycled into a useful product. This product also compares favourably to natural alternatives such as wood and coal - Hot Rocks produce burning characteristic equal or superior to that of natural fuel alternatives. With the restrictions soon to be placed on coal and the proposed new regulations, public awareness on the issue of solid fuels has increased; hence it is an ideal time to enter the manufactured fuels market...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a {{finite element model}} of the microstructure of dispersion type nuclear fuels, {{which can be used}} to determine the effective thermal conductivity of the fuels during irradiation. The model simulates a representative region of the fuel as a prism shaped unit cell made of brick elements. The elements within the unit cell are assigned material properties of either the fuel or the matrix depending on position, {{in such a way as}} to represent randomly distributed fuel particles with a size distribution similar to that of the as <b>manufactured</b> <b>fuel.</b> By applying an appropriate heat flux across the unit cell it is possible to determine the effective thermal conductivity of the unit cell as a function of the volume fraction of the fuel particles. The presence of a fuel/matrix interaction layer is simulated by the addition of a third set of material properties that are assigned to the finite elements that surround each fuel particle. In this way the effective thermal conductivity of the material may also be determined as a function of the volume fraction of the interaction layer. Work is on going to add fission gas bubbles in the fuel as a fourth phase to the model...|$|E

Liquid-fluoride reactors {{may have}} attractive features, such as inherent safety, {{no need to}} <b>manufacture</b> <b>fuel</b> rods and possibly simpler reprocessing of the liquid fuel. This concept was first investigated at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment in the 1960s. From 2012 it {{became the subject of}} renewed interest worldwide. Japan, China, the UK, as well as private US, Czech and Australian companies have expressed intent to develop and commercialize the technology.|$|R
40|$|Successive {{closing down}} of filled-up large {{municipal}} landfill sites or those which no longer fulfil the legal regulations, compel local gov-ernments and enterprises dealing with waste disposal, to undertake ac-tivities aimed at designing {{and construction of}} new waste management plants. One of these is a municipal solid waste sorting plant where the waste stream is divided into sub-screen and screen fraction. The screen fraction after removing ferrous and non-ferrous metals, glass and other impurities and crushing to an appropriate particle size constitutes an al-ternative fuel. The most frequently alternative fuel is manufactured from selectively collected plastics, rubber, textiles and waste paper. Alternative fuel is also manufactured from municipal solid waste in mechanical waste treatment plants. Municipal solid waste {{is characterized by a}} non-uniform morphological composition (depending on many factors), which may re-sult in variable parameters of the <b>manufactured</b> <b>fuel.</b> If the waste fuel man-ufactured in this way and supplied to cement plants does not reach certain quality standards, its price is low, or the product is not accepted for energy recovery. The work presents results of analyses of selected properties of alternative fuels generated from solid municipal waste stream with regard to the type of communes from which the waste originated (urban com-mune area or rural communes). Statistical analysis was conducted using Bayesian Networks. As it results from the investigations, alternative fuel manufactured from municipal solid waste is characterized by high values of variation coefficient for such parameters as: ash content, moisture and calorif-ic value. The content of carbon, sulphur and incineration heat revealed low values of variance coefficient. The analyses have demonstrated tha...|$|E
