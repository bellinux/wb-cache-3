40|$|A {{realistic}} {{prediction of}} deflection in slabs is only possible if {{the effects of}} early age striking, and construction loads on tension stiffening are included. Non-linear finite element analyses {{have been made to}} gain a better understanding ofthe 'mechanisms of tension stiffening in tension members and slabs. Laboratory tests have been carried out to gather information on the cracking moment, the mean moment resisted by cracked concrete (derived from strain measurements and back analysis of deflecti~n data) and influence ofpeak construction loading on deflection. Nine tests on slabs have provided data on the cracking moment of slab compared with companion beams. Mean surface strains were measured' in the constant moment region of the slabs with a Demec gauge. These strains were used to determine the position of neutral axis and the curvature which was also determined from a back analysis of deflection data measured by transducers. The mean strain in the reinforcement over the constant moment region is obtained by assuming it equals the mean surface strain at the level of reinforcement. An improved method is developed for taking account of construction loading in deflection calculations with EC 2. Crack spacing and crack width were two phenomena which were measured and taken into account for non-linear fInite element analysis made in parallel with experiment. Numerical investigation into mechanisms Jor tension stiffening has been carried out with non linear fInite element analys'is 'of tension spec'imens and beams with discrete cracks and bond slip. The output from the one-dimensional analys~s includes crack spacings, distribution of bond stress, slip, tensile stress in concrete, tensile stress in reinforcement and load-displacement. In the two-dimensional model mechanism of tension stiffening in beams has been investigated. Comparison has been made between predicted deflections and deflection given by EC 2 as well as tension tie model. Vollum's previous assumption, which was derived from a back analysis of Cardington data, has been validated. The results of the analysis have been used to develop a simplifIed tension stiffening model for use in NLFEA in which the stiffness of the reinforcement is <b>modifIed</b> to model tension stiffening in reinforced concrete slabs.

[Molecular diagram availble in pdf] This work represents the fIrst structural and magnetic studies {{of a family of}} spin crossover macrocycles that comprise of both structural and stereo-isomers. Magnetic susceptibility and Mossbauer data for the R,R-complex (I) is consistent with both a thermal and a light induced spin crossover transition. The X-ray data supports a change in geometry accompanying the thermal spin transition, from a high spin (HS) 7 -coordinate complex at room temperature to a low spin (LS) 5 -coordinate complex at 100 K. The crystal structure ofthe racemic complex (III) reveals a HS, 7 -coordinate complex at 200 K that undergoes no signifIcant structural changes on cooling. In contrast, the magnetic - susceptibility and Mossbauer data collected on a powder sample of the racemic complex are consistent with a LS complex. Finally, the meso complex (IV) was prepared and its structure and magnetic properties are consistent with a 5 -coordinate LS complex that remains low spin, but undergoes conformational changes on cooling in solution. The chiral [Fe(H) (N 302) (CN) 2] macro cycle (I), together with its Mn(H) and Fe(H) derivatives have also been exploited as building blocks for the self-assembly of chiral magnets. In the second project, a synthetic route for the preparation of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) donors covalently attached to a diisopropyl verdazyl radical via a cross conjugated pyridyl linker IS presented. Following this strategy, four new TTF-py- (diisopropyl) verdazyl radicals have been prepared and characterized (V) - (VIII). [Molecular diagram available in pdf] The first (2 : 1) charge transfer complex ofa TTF-py-(diisopropyl) verdazyl radical donor and a TCNQ acceptor has been prepared and structurally characterized. The crystal packing shows that the donor and acceptor molecules are organized in a mixed stacking arrangement consistent with its insulating behaviour. EPR and magnetic susceptibility data support intramolecular ferromagnetic interactions between the TTF and the verdazyl radicals and antiferromagnetic interactions between TTF donors within a stack. In an attempt to increase the intramolecular exchange interaction between the two radicals, a TTF-x-(diisopropyl) verdazyl radical (IX) was prepared, where the two radicals are connected ia a conjugated divinylene linker.

Component-based failures such as delamination and biocompatibility-based failures such as membrane fouling and degradation still remain a signifi cant challenge. This study focuses on the surface properties and modi cation of polyurethane and silicone rubber as coating material for amperometric sensing devices. E ffective synthesis of polyurethane, as well as surface <b>modifi</b> cation techniques performed on polymers already attached to sensing devices, are proposed. Phase inversion resulted in increased soft segment content on the surface (confi rmed by FTIR with a decreased C=O/C=C ratio). It is proposed that such an optimised polymer surface enhances the yield of further surface modi cation, such as hydroxylation (using potassium peroxodisulphate) and sulphonation (employing sodium hydride, triisobutylaluminium and 1, 3 propane sultone). A novel method to generate an SO 3 -derivatised PU surface was proposed. Additionally, successful synthesis of silicone rubber for induced permeability of H 2 O 2 was demonstrated.

40|$|In {{order to}} create {{effective}} therapeutically signifi cant oligonucleotide structures, a series of analogs of thrombin-binding aptamer d(GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG) containing thiophosphoryl substitutions were synthesized. The anticoagulation effects of the resultant thrombin-binding aptamer analogs were evaluated {{and the effects of}} local thiomodifi cations on their structure and function were studied, including the effects on stability in blood plasma and resistance to DNA nucleases. A promising <b>modifi</b> ed oligonucleotide (LL 11) was found with the structure <b>modifi</b> ed only in TT loops. It retains antithrombin properties of thrombin-binding aptamer, but is more resistant to biodegradation. Key Words: DNA aptamers; oligonucleotide thiophosphoryl analogs; anticoagulation ef-fects; MALDI mass spectrometr...|$|E
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{development}} of new teaching ideologies {{in the context of the}} technocratic ideology of the Cold War. These ideologies did not simply vanish after 1989. The catchwords were “programmed instruction” and “teaching machines”, accompanied by the promise that all students would make effi cient learning progress. Although Eastern and Western states fought the Cold War over political ideologies, their teaching ideologies (perhaps surprisingly) converged. This may explain why neither the apparent failure of these educational ideologies nor the end of the Cold War led to the <b>modifi</b> cation of the ideologies themselves, but rather to the <b>modifi</b> cation of devices serving the ideologies...|$|E
