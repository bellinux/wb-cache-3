We applied the ANN to analyze a time series of measured data for network response evaluation.

The comparison between some training algorithms demonstrates the efficiency and the accu-racy of the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and the Resilient back propagation (Rp) algorithms in term of statistical crite-ria. Consequently, the obtained results show that the developed models, using the LM and the Rp algorithms, can successfully be used for analyzing internet traffic over IP networks, and can be applied as an excellent and fundamental tool for the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> traffic at different times...|$|E

It is found that the web does expose us to more rumor and increase {{the speed of the}} rumors spread. Corresponding to these new ways of spreading, the government should carry out some measures, such as issuing message by media, punishing the principal spreader, and enhancing <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet.</b> In order to assess these measures, dynamical models without and with control measures are established. Firstly, for two models, equilibria and the basic reproduction number of models are discussed. More importantly, numerical simulation is implemented to assess control measures of rumor spread between individuals-to-individuals and medium-to-individuals. Finally, it is found that the amount of message released by government has the greatest influence on the rumor spread. The reliability of government and the cognizance ability of the public are more important. Besides that, monitoring the internet {{to prevent the spread of}} rumor is more important than deleting messages in media which already existed.

40|$|Over {{a quarter}} century has passed since IP {{addresses}} from the Internet’s now globally ubiquitous (IPv 4) address pool first began to be distributed to and used by operators of the 28, 000 and counting independent routing domains that constitute today’s Internet. At current demand rates, the total pool of IPv 4 addresses {{is expected to be}} fully allocated within the next 3 - 5 years. Despite the looming exhaustion of the address pool, many Internet network operators have exhibited reluctance to transition to the successor address resource pool (IPv 6). In light of the looming scarcity of IPv 4 addresses, there is growing interest in the potential for market-based allocation mechanisms to induce more efficient use of the IPv 4 address space and to smooth the transition to IPv 6. Some of these proposals include allowing existing allocations to be reclaimed or traded to supplement the supply of IPv 4 addresses to meet continuing demand. This paper will provide an appropriate contextual framing, suitable for a multidisciplinary audience, of the ongoing discussion of how market forces might be introduced to enhance the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> address space.

40|$|In {{the early}} days, the Internet used static routes, but very quickly network administrators couldn’t keep {{manually}} updating their routing tables. Later, Internet network administrator used a protocol called EGP but EGP was not scalable so BGP {{was introduced to}} solve all problems and more. BGP stands for Border Gateway Protocol and the most current version is BGP 4. BGP is a routing protocol that runs on routers. BGP allows fully decentralized <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet.</b> That means, if BGP router is on the Internet, it can tell all other routers that what networks are available {{to everyone in the}} world. BGP calls each routing domain an autonomous system (AS). It selects the best path, through the Internet, by choosing the route that has to traverse the fewest autonomous systems. As BGP provides information for controlling the flow of packets between ASes, the protocol plays a critical role in Internet efficiency, reliability, and security. However, slow convergence and abnormal termination of session are major vulnerability of BGP. Simplifying BGP design complexity helps in research, for the root cause analysis of BGP. Deriving technique to prevent the loss of data, reduce the convergence time and maintaining the sessions of BGP by instantly diverting the traffic from teardown / flapped link to the backup link considering as active link. It will be a great success to achieve the goal to maintain the sessions and reduce the BGP convergence time. </p...|$|E
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses privatizing the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> domain name system. This system is a vital aspect of the Internet that works like an automated telephone directory, allowing users to reach Web sites using easy-to-understand domain names like www. senate. gov, instead of the string of numbers that computers use when communicating with each other. The U. S. government supported {{the development of the}} domain name system, and, in 1997, the President charged the Department of Commerce with transitioning it to private management. The Department issued a policy statement, called the "White Paper," that defined the four guiding principles for the privatization effort as stability, competition, representation, and private, bottom-up coordination. After reviewing several proposals from private sector organizations, the Department chose the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a not-for-profit corporation, to carry out the transition. In November 1998, the Department entered into an agreement with ICANN {{in the form of a}} Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) under which the two parties agreed to collaborate on a joint transition project. Progress on and completion of each task is assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis, with input from ICANN. The timing and eventual outcome of the transition remains highly uncertain. ICANN has made significant progress in carrying out MOU tasks related to one of the guiding principles of the transition effort [...] increasing competition [...] but progress has been much slower in the areas of increasing the stability and security of the Internet; ensuring representation of the Internet community in domain name policy-making; and using private bottom-up coordination. Although the transition is well behind schedule, the Department's public assessment of the progress being made on the transition has been limited for several reasons. First, the Department carries out its oversight of ICANN's MOU-related activities mainly through informal discussions with ICANN officials. Second, although the transition is past its original September 2000 completion date, the Department has not provided a written assessment of ICANN's progress since mid- 1999. Third, although the Department stated that it welcomed the call for the reform of ICANN, they have not yet taken public position on reforms being proposed. ...|$|E
