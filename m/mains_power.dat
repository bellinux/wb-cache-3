5|$|Modern Leslie {{speakers}} have an 11-pin interface that {{is safer}} to service, as the <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> is carried separately using a standard IEC mains connector. The Hammond-Suzuki Leslie 2101 also includes line in and line out jacks, so a combo preamp {{is no longer}} required. Its settings can also be controlled via MIDI.|$|E
5|$|The {{authorized}} {{loudspeaker enclosure}} {{to use with}} a console organ was the Hammond Tone Cabinet, which housed an external amplifier and speaker in a cabinet. The cabinet carried a balanced mono signal along with the necessary <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> directly from the organ, using a six-pin cable. Spinet organs contained a built-in power amplifier and loudspeakers, so did not require a tone cabinet.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Bush and Marshall {{teamed up}} with {{physicist}} Charles G. Smith, who had invented a device called the S-tube. This enabled radios, which had previously required {{two different types of}} batteries, to operate from <b>mains</b> <b>power.</b> Marshall raised $25,000 to set up the American Appliance Company on July 7, 1922, to market the invention, with Bush and Smith among its five directors. The venture made Bush wealthy, and the company, now known as Raytheon, ultimately became a large electronics company and defense contractor.|$|E

5|$|In some units the {{alternator}} {{is essentially}} the same as that used in portable generating sets used to supply <b>mains</b> <b>power,</b> modified to produce a higher current at a lower voltage but still at the 50 or 60Hz grid frequency. In higher-quality units an alternator with more poles is used and supplies current at a higher frequency, such as 400Hz. The smaller amount of time the high-frequency waveform spends near zero makes it much easier to strike and maintain a stable arc than with the cheaper grid-frequency sets or grid-frequency mains-powered units.|$|E
5|$|Older {{models that}} used tube power {{amplifiers}} {{used a variety}} of 6-pin connectors, while later models used a 9-pin connector. In all cases, for a single organ – Leslie configuration, the <b>mains</b> <b>power,</b> audio and control signals are all carried on the connector, and the design of the pin layouts varies between organs and speakers. Care must be taken when attempting to service them since an incorrectly or poorly wired cable can cause permanent damage to the organ and / or speaker, or result in electrocution. It is also possible to connect multiple Leslie speakers to a single organ, by using a power relay that provides the necessary AC current.|$|E

30|$|Most ESL systems {{use either}} wired {{communication}} networks or wireless communication with battery-powered labels. In our research, the communication network is a WSN {{and the power}} source of the labels is an energy harvester. A typical EHESL system would consist of several thousands indoor solar cell-powered label nodes. They form a star topology with a central <b>mains</b> <b>powered</b> controller, which is connected to a price database.|$|R
25|$|Supercapacitors buffer {{power to}} and from {{rechargeable}} batteries, mitigating the effects of short power interruptions and high current peaks. Batteries kick in only during extended interruptions, e.g., if the <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> or a fuel cell fails, which lengthens battery life.|$|E
25|$|The power Cannon (also {{called the}} XLR-LNE connector) had {{shrouded}} pins and red insulation, {{it was intended}} as a <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> plug, but has been superseded by the IEC 60320 series of connectors and increasingly, more recently, the PowerCon connector developed by Neutrik.|$|E
25|$|While at Rugby, the {{transmitter}} generated 60kW of {{radio frequency power}} (using 70kW of <b>mains</b> <b>power).</b> The 180m-high T-aerial antenna was 500m across at its top. The vertical part of the antenna radiated the signal, so that the received strength was similar in all directions (it was approximately omnidirectional).|$|E
50|$|The Jennings Organ Company {{was founded}} by Thomas Walter Jennings in Dartford Kent, England after World War II. Jennings' first {{successful}} product was the Univox, an early <b>mains</b> <b>powered</b> electronic keyboard with built-in valve amplifier and loudspeaker, similar to the Clavioline. There is some debate over whether the Clavioline or Univox {{was used in the}} song Telstar, but many think that it was the latter.|$|R
30|$|In our work, {{we focus}} on WSNs for {{real-time}} data collection from battery or energy harvester-powered miniaturized sensor nodes [2] to <b>mains</b> <b>powered</b> data sinks with transmission of up to 100 sensor values per second and high reliability. The data sink (later called coordinator and the gateway to a wired industrial network) is stationary, while the sensor nodes (later called device) are distributed over an industrial plant. Most of the devices are stationary, but might also be mobile. The time varying wireless channels between the nodes and the gateway are characterized by multipath propagation due to large-scale reflectors, moving and stationary obstacles, LOS and non-LOS links, and different interferers. The limited power resources in the sensor nodes require a balance between energy awareness and retransmission attempts. The first aim of this work is an improvement of the reliability while saving energy in the sensor nodes. Therefore, we introduce a (wherever applicable <b>mains</b> <b>powered)</b> relay node which supports the sensor nodes in saving energy and increasing data transmission reliability by performing retransmissions.|$|R

25|$|For {{the greater}} part of World War II the Royal Australian Navy set up an {{observation}} post within the grounds of the Caloundra Head Lighthouse reserve. Twenty-four hour watches were kept, and display of the light to shipping was controlled. The light was converted to 240 volt <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> in 1942 and a petrol standby engine was added. The lighthouse no longer needed to be manned, so the Coastal Artillery occupied the lightkeeper's cottage and oversaw the operation of the light.|$|E
30|$|WSN-HEAP [14] (WSN-powered {{solely by}} ambient energy harvesting) uses {{piezoelectric}} devices to transform ambient vibrations into electric energy. It uses a star topology with multiple sinks. The sinks are (<b>mains</b> <b>powered)</b> wireless nodes. This solution is deployed {{to monitor the}} health of railroad infrastructure. The energy harvesting devices uses vibrations induces by passing trains to gain power. They control the transmit power of the energy harvesting devices {{in order to achieve}} an optimal node lifetime and throughput.|$|R
5000|$|The {{choice of}} {{which of the}} tests to use is at the operator's {{discretion}} as there is merit in each test for given situations. Later model testers that are battery powered are limited to doing the [...] "screen test". Older <b>mains</b> <b>powered</b> units can do all tests. Even [...] "type testing" [...] may only be testing {{at a fraction of}} the operational power of the unit.The power dissipated in the earth is only 300 watts compared to operational power which may be in excess of 2000 watts.|$|R
2500|$|Electrical {{circuits}} may {{be connected}} to ground (earth) for several reasons. [...] In <b>mains</b> <b>powered</b> equipment, exposed metal parts are connected to ground to prevent user contact with dangerous voltage when electrical insulation fails. [...] In electrical power distribution systems, a protective ground conductor {{is an essential part}} of the safety earthing system. [...] Connection to ground also limits the build-up of static electricity when handling flammable products or electrostatic-sensitive devices. In some telegraph and power transmission circuits, the earth itself can be used as one conductor of the circuit, saving the cost of installing a separate return conductor (see single-wire earth return).|$|R
25|$|A smoke {{detector}} is {{a device that}} detects smoke and issues a signal. Most {{smoke detector}}s work either by optical detection or by physical process, {{but some of them}} use both detection methods to increase sensitivity to smoke. Smoke detectors are usually powered by battery while some are connected directly to power mains, often having a battery as a power supply backup in case the <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> fails. The first automatic electric fire alarm was co-invented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton and Fernando J. Dibble. Upton and Dibble were issued U.S. patent #436,961. Upton was an associate of Thomas Alva Edison, although {{there is no evidence that}} Edison contributed to this invention.|$|E
25|$|On March 15, 2015, a fire engulfed the convent's tallest bell tower, which pinnacles at {{height of}} 72 meters. The monastery had been {{undergoing}} major repair work and {{was covered in}} scaffolding. It took firefighters almost three hours {{to put out the}} fire. The blaze reportedly affected an area of three hundred square metres, but it was restricted to the scaffolding and didn't do any damage to the historical building itself. The speculated cause of the fire was a short circuit caused by heat guns used for drying the facade. The press service for the Moscow cultural heritage department has blamed the fire on the firm doing the restoration work. However, Russian Deputy Culture Minister Grigory Pirumov said that heat guns were not in use on the territory of the convent and the bell tower had been disconnected from the <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> supply.|$|E
25|$|High {{voltages}} have disadvantages, such as {{the increased}} insulation required, and generally increased difficulty in their safe handling. In a power plant, energy is generated at a convenient voltage {{for the design of}} a generator, and then stepped up to a high voltage for transmission. Near the loads, the transmission voltage is stepped down to the voltages used by equipment. Consumer voltages vary somewhat depending on the country and size of load, but generally motors and lighting are built to use up to a few hundred volts between phases. The voltage delivered to equipment such as lighting and motor loads is standardized, with an allowable range of voltage over which equipment is expected to operate. Standard power utilization voltages and percentage tolerance vary in the different <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> systems found in the world. High-voltage direct-current (HVDC) electric power transmission systems have become more viable as technology has provided efficient means of changing the voltage of DC power. HVDC systems, however, tend to be more expensive and less efficient over shorter distances than transformers. Transmission with high voltage direct current was not feasible {{in the early days of}} electric power transmission, as there was then no economically viable way to step down the voltage of DC for end user applications such as lighting incandescent bulbs.|$|E
50|$|Derating of <b>mains</b> <b>powered,</b> phase-fired {{controllers}} {{is important}} {{as they are}} often used to control resistive loads, such as heating elements. Over time, the resistance of heating elements can increase. To account for this, a phase-fired control {{must be able to}} provide some degree of extra voltage to draw the same heating current through the element. The only way of achieving this is to purposely design the supply to require less than 100% of the input's modulation cycle when the elements are first put in place, progressively opening the supply up towards delivering 100% of the input modulation cycle as the elements age.|$|R
50|$|Some devices (e.g., HF ballasts) are <b>mains</b> <b>powered,</b> {{and only}} have {{functional}} isolation between the mains and the DALI control. This means {{that even though}} the DALI control cable operates at ELV potential, it must be treated as if it were at mains potential. A DALI network requires a 24V DC 250 mA power supply to operate. This voltage appears on the data cables and can be used to supply power to peripherals that require it, such as motion detectors. A separate power supply can be used, although some manufacturers provide DALI gateways with an integrated power supply.|$|R
5000|$|LT, {{low tension}} or A battery, the {{supply to the}} {{filaments}} or heaters. Early tubes designed for battery operation had 2 volt filaments (for use with a lead-acid cell). Later tubes had 1.4 volt filaments to run from dry batteries. With the introduction of <b>mains</b> <b>powered</b> equipment, indirectly heated tubes became more common and usually (though not always) required 4 volts in Europe and 6.3 volts in America. The latter became the standard voltage after the Second world war. One notable exception was that rectifier tubes often had 5 volt filaments or heaters which usually {{had to have a}} separate supply anyway.|$|R
