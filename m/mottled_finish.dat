50|$|Knockdown Texture is a drywall {{finishing}} style. It is a mottled texture, {{more intense}} than a simple flat finish, but less intense than orange peel, or popcorn, texture.Knockdown texture is created by watering down joint compound to a soupy consistency. A trowel is then used to apply the joint compound. The joint compound will begin to form stalactites as it dries. The trowel is then run {{over the surface of}} the drywall, knocking off the stalactites and leaving the <b>mottled</b> <b>finish.</b>|$|E
