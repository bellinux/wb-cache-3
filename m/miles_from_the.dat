5|$|Because of its {{position}} more than 2,000 <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nearest continental landmass, {{the island of}} Hawaii {{is one of the}} most geographically isolated landmasses on Earth; this in turn has strongly influenced its ecology. The majority of the species present on the island are endemic to it and can be found nowhere else on Earth, the result of an isolated evolutionary lineage sheltered from external biotic influence; this makes its ecosystem vulnerable both to invasive species and human development, and an estimated third of the island's natural flora and fauna has already gone extinct.|$|E
