40|$|In the Mekong Delta {{region of}} South-Vietnam, wine from purple glutinous rice is {{particularly}} interesting {{because of its}} sherry-like taste and flavour and its attractive brown-red colour. It is manufactured at home or by small cottage industries, using traditional solid-state starters (Men). With the objective of improving the knowledge about the functionality of traditional Men, this study deals with the properties and composition of 29 samples of Vietnamese commercial rice wine starters. We selected 6 rice wine starters for their superior ability to liquefy cooked rice, high ethanol accumulation, and production of attractive flavour and colour in the resulting wine. Ethanol contents reached 12 g/ 100 ml, a sweet alcoholic fragrance was noticed and the wine colour varied from red to lightly brown. Total <b>mould,</b> <b>yeast</b> and bacteria counts in Men were 3. 4 ¿ 6. 0, 5. 8 ¿ 7. 2 and 2. 6 ¿ 6. 2 log CFU/g of dry weight sample, respectively. A total of 119 microbial strains, comprising 53 moulds, 51 yeasts and 15 bacteria, was isolated. Mould isolates with excellent functionality were identified as Amylomyces rouxii, Amylomyces aff. rouxii (an atypical form of A. rouxii), Rhizopus oligosporus and Rhizopus oryzae. Yeast isolates with excellent fermentation properties were all identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae; other, less functional isolates were identified as Candida glabrata and Pichia anomala...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the rate of Coliform, Staphylococcus aureus, <b>Mould,</b> <b>Yeast</b> and other aerobic and mesophilic bacteria as contaminats of milk and milk products in Yazd province. Material and Methods: In this study a total of 198 different samples including Milk (24. 2 %), Yoghurt (21. 2 %), Cream (12. 1 %), Cheese (18. 2 %), Ice cream (12. 1 %) and dairy powders (12. 1 %) were investigated by culture method and biochemical tests.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the influence of nitrogen fertilization and irrigation on the total count of aerobic mesophilic microorganisms, <b>moulds</b> and <b>yeasts</b> in the soil.

For determination of total number of mesophilic aerobic microorganisms, <b>moulds</b> and <b>yeasts</b> the samples were diluted and cultivated on medium sheets coated with culture medium according to the requirements of the microorganisms. Data analysis shows that fertilization has the strongest multiplication effect on the number of aerobic mesophilic microorganisms in soil (their 6 6 number increases from 10. 522 x 10 to 12. 8 x 10 cfu/g), whereas the irrigation does not have any statistically significant impact.

The same conditions of pressure, temperature, and time were applied to different vegetables (lettuce, tomato, asparagus, spinach, cauliflower and onion), achieving reductions of from 2 - 4 log units in both viable mesophiles and <b>moulds</b> and <b>yeasts</b> at pressures of between 300 and 400 MPa. Sensory characteristics were unaltered, especially in asparagus, onion, tomato and cauliflower, though slight browning was observed in cauliflower at 350 MPa. Flow cytometry was applied to certain of the microbial populations used in the above experiment before and after the pressurization treatment. The results were indicative of differing percentage survival rates depending on micro-organism type, with higher survival rates for Gram-positive bacteria, except L. monocytogenes, than in the other test micro-organisms. Growth of survivors was undetectable using the plate count method, suggesting that microorganisms suffering from pressure stress were metabolically inactive though alive. The pressurization treatments did not inactivate the peroxidase responsible for browning in vegetables. Confocal microscopic examination of epidermal tissue from onion showed that the enzyme had been displaced to the cell interior. Use of low temperatures and moderately long pressurization times yielded improved inactivation of micro-organisms and better sensorial characteristics of the vegetables, and should lower industrial costs.
