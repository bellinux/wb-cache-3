40|$|AbstractPatients with {{inherited}} metabolic storage {{disorders are}} at {{a higher risk of}} developing pulmonary complications after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). This single-center prospective study of 48 consecutive inherited metabolic storage disorder patients was performed to identify risk factors for the development of pulmonary complications after HCT. Before HCT, subjects underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for cell count, culture, nitrite levels, and analysis of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The overall incidence of pulmonary complications was 52 % (infectious, 23 %; noninfectious, 29 %) over a period of 4 years. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was the most frequent noninfectious complication and occurred in 19 % of patients, all of whom had a diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis (Hurler and <b>Maroteaux-Lamy</b> <b>syndromes).</b> Levels of interleukin (IL) – 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, tumor necrosis factor α, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 α, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in BAL fluid samples obtained before HCT were higher in patients with mucopolysaccharidoses than in patients with leukodystrophies. In addition, levels of IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor were increased in the BAL fluid of patients who developed noninfectious pulmonary complications compared with those who did not develop pulmonary complications. It {{is interesting to note that}} most noninfectious pulmonary complications occurred in patients with mucopolysaccharidoses, especially diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, which occurred exclusively in patients with mucopolysaccharidoses. Higher levels of bronchial proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines may be predictive of the development of subsequent posttransplantation noninfectious complications in patients with mucopolysaccharidoses, especially those with Hurler syndrome. Larger studies will be required to further elucidate etiologic mechanisms and predictive factors...|$|R
40|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the lysosome, already three out of the seven currently known mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) were described in medical literature. In 1917, Hunter syndrome was the first to be described in two brothers (“they are as alike as two peas”) by Charles Hunter. Gertrud Hurler published her two case reports about MPS I in 1919, and MPS IV was outlined in 1929 by the Uruguayan dr. Morquio. All described young children with or without mental impairment, with profound bone abnormalities. In 1955, the Belgian scientist Christian de Duve discovered a new intra-cellular organelle that he named the lysosome. Eventually, this brought light to more than 50 inherited diseases all concerning a defect in the lysosomal system. The group of mucopolysaccharidoses belonged to these lysosomal disorders and all types proved to be characterized by the deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme. New types of MPSs were discovered since then. In 1963 two French physicians described a new form of dysostosis mupltiplex, MPS VI, and the syndrome was named after them: <b>Maroteaux-Lamy’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> 4. In the same year dr. Sanfilippo described {{for the first time a}} MPS III patient with mental impairment and excretion of heparan sulphate. Later, Sanfillippo disease was subdivided in type A, B, C, and D because between 1972 and 1980 different enzyme deficiencies were discovered in each of the four subtypes. Finally, in 1973, MPS VII was described by the American dr. Sly. MPS V and MPS VIII, first thought to be novel diseases, later turned out to be already known types of MPS and are not separate entities anymore. In 1996 Natowicz et al reported the first patient with MPS IX. Till now, only one other family has been reported with this disease...|$|R

It {{is caused by}} a deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine- 4 -sulfatase (arylsulfatase B), for which a recombinant formulation (galsulfase) is available as replacement therapy. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of galsulfase compared to placebo or no interventions, for treating MPS VI. We also considered studies evaluating different doses of galsulfase. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted. A computerized electronic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, SciELO, and LILACS was carried on to identify any randomized trials that met our inclusion criteria. Results: Two studies were included in the review. Because the number of studies was small, our analysis probably did not find any statistically significant difference. Long-term follow-up will be required to ascertain full clinical benefit, on both event-free survival and quality of life measures. Conclusions: There is some evidence to support the use of galsulfase in the treatment of MPS VI; however due to the very low quantity of included studies we could not analyze it in an appropriate way. This review highlights the need for continued research into the use of enzyme replacement therapy for MPS VI.

To predict the consequences of p. R 315 Q, p. L 82 R and p. S 384 N, we also modeled and compared the three amino-acid changes in the three-dimensional ARSB structure.

40|$|Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI, or <b>Maroteaux-Lamy</b> <b>syndrome,</b> is a {{lysosomal}} storage disorder {{caused by}} a deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase B (ASB), also known as N-acetylgalactosamine- 4 -sulfatase. Multiple clinical phenotypes of this autosomal recessively inherited disease have been described. Recent isolation and characterization of the human ASB gene facilitated the analysis of molecular defects underlying the different phenotypes. Conditions for PCR amplification of the entire open reading frame from genomic DNA and for subsequent direct automated DNA sequencing of the resulting DNA fragments were established. Besides two polymorphisms described elsewhere that cause methionine-for-valine substitutions in the arylsulfatase B gene, six new mutations in six patients were detected: four point mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions, a 1 -bp deletion, and a 1 -bp insertion. The point mutations were two G-to-A and two T-to-C transitions. The G-to-A transitions cause an arginine-for-glycine substitution at residue 144 in a homoallelic patient with a severe disease phenotype and a tyrosine-for-cysteine substitution at residue 521 in a potentially heteroallelic patient with the severe form of the disease. The T-to-C transitions cause an arginine-for-cysteine substitution at amino acid residue 192 in a homoallelic patient with mild symptoms and a proline-for-leucine substitution at amino acid 321 in a homoallelic patient with the intermediate form. The insertion between nucleotides T 1284 and G 1285 resulted {{in a loss of}} the 100 C-terminal amino acids of the wild-type protein and in the deletion of nucleotide C 1577 in a 39 -amino-acid C-terminal extension of the ASB polypeptide.

Aglycone structures that influence substrate binding and/or enzyme activity were an adjacent-residue C- 6 carboxy group and a second but internal N-acetylgalactosamine 4 -sulphate residue. Arylsulphatase B activity in fibroblast homogenates assayed with O-(beta-N-acetylgalactosamine 4 -sulphate) -(1 [...] 4) -O-D-(beta-glucuronic acid) -(1 [...] 3) -O-D-N-acetyl[1 - 3 H] galactosaminitol 4 -sulphate derived from chondroitin 4 -sulphate as substrate clearly distinguished Maroteaux-Lamy-syndrome patients from normal controls and other mucopolysaccharidosis patients. We recommend the use of the above trisaccharide substrate for both postnatal and prenatal diagnosis of <b>Maroteaux-Lamy</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|E
40|$|Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI), or <b>Maroteaux-Lamy</b> <b>syndrome,</b> is a {{lysosomal}} storage {{disorder that}} results from a deficiency of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine- 4 -sulfatase or arylsulfatase B (ASB). It is a rel-atively rare disorder, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 248, 000 to 1 in 300, 000. The diagnosis is {{made on the basis}} of findings of elevated urine glycosaminoglycans and a deficiency of ASB activity in leukocytes or cultured fibroblasts. In treatment of MPS VI, enzyme replacement therapy (galsulfase; human recombinant ASB enzyme) became available. Infusions of galsulfase were generally well tolerated. But in some patients, infusion-associated reactions including rash, urticaria, headache, hypotension, nausea, and vomiting were documented and were managed successfully by interrupting or slowing the rate of infusion and/or by the administration of antihista-mines, antipyretics, corticosteroids, or oxygen. Here, we report a case with MPS VI who developed thrombo-cytopenia after third dose of therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about thrombocytopenia associated with galsulfase therapy in the literature. Additionally, with this report, we want to share our approach for this case...|$|E
