After {{years of research}} and experience, Savory came to understand this assertion was often wrong, and that sometimes removing animals actually <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>worse.</b> This concept is {{a variation of the}} trophic cascade, where humans are seen as the top level predator and the cascade follows from there.|$|E
25|$|Darrell Porter tied it in {{the sixth}} by {{doubling}} in two runs. Then, {{in the bottom of}} the eighth, the Brewers felt the effects of not having Rollie Fingers in the bullpen. With one out, Pete Ladd, pressed into service as the closer, walked Lonnie Smith with two on to load the bases and then walked pinch-hitter Steve Braun to force in the go-ahead run. The Cardinals could have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>worse,</b> but McGee lined out to short for out #2, and an apparent base hit by Ozzie Smith struck Braun as he was running to second for the third out.|$|E
25|$|In August 1750, on {{a journey}} back from Germany to London, Handel was seriously injured in a {{carriage}} accident between The Hague and Haarlem in the Netherlands. In 1751 one eye started to fail. The cause was a cataract which was operated on by the great charlatan Chevalier Taylor. This did not improve his eyesight, but possibly <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>worse.</b> He was completely blind by 1752. He died in 1759 at home in Brook Street, at age 74. The last performance he attended was of Messiah. Handel was buried in Westminster Abbey. More than three thousand mourners attended his funeral, which was given full state honours.|$|E

25|$|With {{experience}} {{fighting in}} Norway, {{efforts were made}} to extend the combat range of the Bf 110C; these became the Bf 110D Long Range (Langstrecken) Zerstörer. Several different external fuel tanks, originally a 1,200L (320US gal) centerline ventral fuel tank (nicknamed Dackelbauch (dachshund's belly), later 300L or 900L (240US gal) underwing-mounted tanks, resulted in no less than four versions of the Bf 110D. The enormous Dackelbauch ventral tank, owing to cold weather and limited knowledge of fuel vapours, sometimes exploded, leading to unexplained losses during the North Sea patrols. As a result, the aircrews came to dislike this version. The handling characteristics were also affected; the Bf 110 was not manoeuvrable to begin with and the added weight <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>worse.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jha {{argues that}} local schools for pre-adolescent {{children}} were in a flourishing state in thousands of villages of Bihar and Bengal until {{the early decades of}} the nineteenth century. They were village institutions, maintained by village elders with local funds, where their children (from all caste clusters and communities) could, if the father wished, receive useful skills. However, the British policies in respect of education and land control adversely affected both the village structure and the village institutions of secular education. The British legal system and the rise of caste consciousness since the second half of the nineteenth century <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>worse.</b> Gradually, village as the base of secular identity and solidarity became too weak to create and maintain its own institution by the end of the nineteenth century and the traditional system decayed.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in Africa, an Eastern monk named Maximus the Confessor {{carried on}} a furious {{campaign}} against Monothelitism, and in 646 he convinced the African councils {{to draw up a}} manifesto against the doctrine. This they forwarded to the new pope Theodore I, who in turn wrote to Patriarch Paul II of Constantinople, outlining the heretical nature of the doctrine. Paul, a devoted Monothelite, replied in a letter directing the Pope to adhere to the doctrine of one will. Theodore in turn excommunicated the Patriarch in 649, declaring him a heretic, after Paul, in 647 or 648, had issued in the name of Emperor Constans II an edict known as the Typos, which banned any mention of either one or two activities or wills in Christ. The Typos, instead of defusing the situation, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>worse</b> by implying that either doctrine was as good as the other. Theodore planned the Lateran Council of 649 but died before he could convene it, which his successor, Pope Martin I, did. The Council condemned the Ecthesis and the Typos, and Pope Martin wrote to Constans, informing the emperor of its conclusions and requiring him to condemn both the Monothelite doctrine and his own Typos. Constans responded by having Pope Martin abducted to Constantinople, where he was tried and condemned to banishment and {{died as a result of}} the torture to which he had been subjected. Maximus also was tried and banished after having his tongue and his hand cut off.|$|E

500|$|Cycling {{magazine}} wrote {{a scathing}} {{report on the}} [...] "scantiness" [...] of the outfit, complaining of loss of modesty and calling the feat a [...] "lamentable incident". Similarly, the Yorkshire Evening Post pointed out that cycling was not a pleasant sight for a man, but that a woman's [...] "abnormal hips" [...] <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>worse.</b> The publicity, despite being negative, helped improve women's rights with the suffragette movement in particular noting {{it was a big}} milestone. Further, it helped show that women need not be tied to the street that they grew up in and had a means to travel. Another effect of the publicity was that Reynolds received love letters, including a marriage proposal from a stranger who was apparently significantly older than her. Reynolds and her family took advantage of the celebrity status, with Reynolds promoting a number of female bicycles over the following years, always in rational cycling attire.|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Bob Ringwood {{turned down}} {{the chance to work}} on Licence to Kill in favor of Batman. Ringwood found it difficult designing the Batsuit because [...] "the image of Batman in the comics is this huge, big six-foot-four hunk with a dimpled chin. Michael Keaton is a guy with average build", he stated. [...] "The problem was to make somebody who was average-sized and ordinary-looking into this bigger-than-life creature." [...] Burton commented, [...] "Michael is a bit claustrophobic, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>worse</b> for him. The costume put him in a dark, Batman-like mood though, so he was able to use it to his advantage". Burton's idea was to use an all-black suit, and was met with positive feedback by Bob Kane. Jon Peters wanted to use a Nike product placement with the Batsuit. Ringwood studied over 200 comic book issues for inspiration. 28 sculpted latex designs were created; 25 different cape looks and 6 different heads were made, accumulating a total cost of $250,000. Comic book fans initially expressed negative feedback against the Batsuit. Burton opted not to use tights, spandex, or underpants as seen in the comic book, feeling it was not intimidating. Prosthetic makeup designer Nick Dudman used acrylic-based makeup paint called PAX for Nicholson's chalk-white face. Part of Nicholson's contract was approval over the makeup designer.|$|E

2500|$|Callaghan's {{method of}} dealing with the {{long-term}} economic difficulties involved pay restraint which had been operating for four years with reasonable success. He gambled that a fifth year would further improve the economy and allow him to be re-elected in 1979, and so attempted to hold pay rises to 5% or less. The trade unions rejected continued pay restraint and in a succession of strikes over the winter of 1978–79 (known as the Winter of Discontent) secured higher pay. The industrial unrest made his government extremely unpopular, and Callaghan's response to one interview question only <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>worse.</b> Returning to the United Kingdom from an economic summit held in Guadeloupe in early 1979, Callaghan was asked, [...] "What is your general approach, in view of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Miranda's creator, Colleen Ballinger, based the {{character}} partly on young women {{that she knew}} in the performance department of her college, Azusa Pacific University. She told The Times of London, [...] "There {{were a lot of}} cocky girls who thought they were really talented, and they ... were so rude and snotty, it drove me nuts. Then I saw all these girls trying to make a career out of putting videos on YouTube ... clueless {{to the fact that they}} were terrible." [...] Ballinger said: [...] "I thought it was so stupid, because I didn't think anybody got famous off of YouTube." [...] Also, when bored in choir class, Ballinger practiced singing slightly sharp or flat to amuse her friends. At first, the [...] "Miranda videos were meant to be an inside joke" [...] among Ballinger's friends. Ballinger's YouTube channel received little traffic for more than a year, but in March 2009, she uploaded a video called [...] "Free Voice Lesson" [...] that quickly became a sensation. The video consists of advice to use, and demonstrations of, techniques that real voice teachers would warn students to avoid, delivered in Miranda's arrogant, off-key way. Miranda's videos drew predictably sharp criticism on YouTube, as many viewers mistakenly believed {{the character}} was a real person, a [...] "neo-Florence Foster Jenkins". As her videos became popular, Ballinger modified the character in response to the negative comments to make it more extreme, baiting the commenters by adopting the catchphrases [...] "Haters Back Off" [...] and [...] "Haters Make Me Famous".

2500|$|... 2015 Greek {{sovereign}} debt default: The publicly acrimonious discussions between Greece and EU-ECB-IMF troika {{culminated in the}} 2015 Greek referendum which massively rejected the terms for accepting bail-out money [...] {{and led to a}} surge in public support for populist political parties in Southern European countries. The suggestion of a temporary 'time-out' from the EuroZone for Greece by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble and a German Finance Ministry suggestion that Greece move titles to Greek assets - including heritage sites and islands to an [...] "external fund" [...] based in Luxembourg to serve as collateral in exchange for bail-out money from the EU-ECB-IMF troika; infuriated many policy-makers who perceived Germany's demands as humiliating punishment and refreshed memories to post-WWII reparations owed by the German government which were never fully repaid due to extensive debt-relief accorded to Germany. Pablo Iglesias, a prominent anti-austerity leader in Spain, hailed the Greek rejection of the bailout plan and expressed solidarity with Greece: [...] "We don’t want to be a German colony". In Italy, Beppe Grillo mocked Germany and the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the IMF troika of lenders saying [...] "Now Merkel and bankers will have food for thought.". Jacob Soll, professor of history and accounting at the University of Southern California, summarized the sentiment amongst academics in Germany: [...] "Germans were honest dupes and the Greeks corrupt, unreliable and incompetent.". Expressing dismay about the far-reaching geopolitical implications of Greece leaving the Eurozone, Timothy Garton Ash, professor of European studies at Oxford University, termed the German-inspired policy prescriptions as deeply flawed and possibly unachievable by Greece [...] "even with the best political will in the world." [...] and warned how the Grexit ("Greece exit") will be perceived elsewhere: [...] "EU can’t get its act together" [...] adding {{that it would be a}} [...] "huge blow for the EU particularly in the eyes of the outside world: China, India, Russia, and the U.S., not to mention closer neighbors." [...] Leading academics and analysts highlighted that EuroZone anti-deficit policies forced upon Greece by the German-backed troika to curb public spending had brought about deflationary pressure, weakened demand and led to widespread unemployment in several EuroZone countries. Paul Krugman, a Nobel economics winner, stated that he was troubled by the actions of the troika to use economics as a weapon to force a regime change in Greece. Fellow Nobel economics laureate Joseph Stiglitz squarely faulted the troika for imposing upon Greece an [...] "unconscionable torture of the present". Wharton finance professor Bulent Gultekin opined: [...] "The endless austerity measures have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>worse</b> for the country. It's been the wrong remedy for the wrong patient at the wrong time". John Cochrane, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University pointed to the source of the current crisis : [...] "Europe should not have bailed out German and French banks and allowed Greece to default in the first instance. In a currency union, {{sovereign debt}} is like corporate debt. Corporations default — or they should — without bailouts, and don’t leave a currency zone when they do so. Europe should not have allowed and encouraged national banks to load up on national debts." [...] Francesco Caselli, professor of economics at the London School of Economics, opined that Greece should [...] "focus on structural reforms rather than austerity. Greece should have gotten meaningful debt relief and much more time to balance the deficit." [...] Olivier Chatain, strategy and business policy professor at HEC business school in Paris opined: [...] "There's a big chasm between what's asked of Greece and what they can do." [...] Mauro Guillén, Wharton management professor and director of The Lauder Institute urged an effort from the creditor nations: [...] "Wages in Germany should rise and government demand for goods and services should increase,(...) Surplus economies, like Germany and the Netherlands, who can spend more should do so". Patrick Minford, professor of economics at Cardiff University in Wales pointedly observed the destructive nature of German economic policies which result in massive trade surpluses for Germany while pauperising weaker EuroZone countries: [...] "unhealthy for Germany to run very large trade surpluses. They’re sabotaging the rest of Europe." [...] Richard Koo, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute assessed the current situation saying: [...] "Greece's debt cannot be paid back under any circumstances, (..) They need to undergo bankruptcy proceedings. We cannot move forward until the Germans and Dutch begin to realize this money will never get paid back and [...] are pushing the Greek economy further into depression." ...|$|E
