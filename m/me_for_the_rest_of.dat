500|$|In Moonwalk (1988), Jackson {{said his}} {{relationship}} with Shields was [...] "romantically serious for a while." [...] Shields said that while never formally proposing, he would speak about the two marrying and raising adoptive children together. The suggestions were met with disapproval from Shields, who felt {{such a move would}} have [...] "divided [...] life too much". She recalled: [...] "There were times when he would ask me to marry him, and I would say, 'You have <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> your life, you don’t need to marry me, I’m going to go on...have my own marriage and my own kids, and you’ll always have me.' I think it made him relax. He didn’t want to lose things that meant something to him." ...|$|E
500|$|Cardiff manager Malky Mackay {{was proud}} of his players despite their defeat: [...] "We wanted to come here and win today but the players have done the club proud, I think today we were playing against a top team and I think we have got a lot to be proud of." [...] Anthony Gerrard, who missed the decisive penalty took to Twitter to apologise to Cardiff fans stating that the miss would [...] "...haunt <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> my days!" [...] Despite Gerrard's apology, Cardiff goalkeeper Tom Heaton was adamant that none of the players should take the blame for the defeat: [...] "There is {{definitely}} no blame attached to any of the lads who missed. They all had the strength of character to stand up and take a penalty in front of 90,000 people and the world watching in a pressure situation. They should be credited and congratulated for taking them. Sadly, it wasn’t our day.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Woman," [...] {{answered}} Rachel quietly, [...] "the Heavens {{killed the}} bull {{which would have}} hurt <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> ask of <b>the</b> captains of the King." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{poor old}} father! Let {{him know that}} I neither would nor could disturb Robert in his inheritance, attainted traitor as <b>the</b> laws esteem <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> mayhap I shall write to him if the good angel you talk of will help me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know not}} that," [...] he answered. [...] "The lad is more generous than his sire, and if I were {{to send him}} word that I have been affronted, he might consent to meet <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> I could kill him blindfolded," [...] he added, with a shrug.|$|R
500|$|In a 1994 interview, Joel {{dismissed}} {{criticism of}} unclear elements in their films: [...] "People {{have a problem}} dealing {{with the fact that}} our movies are not straight-ahead. They would prefer that the last half of Barton Fink just be about a screenwriter's writing-block problems and how they get resolved in the real world...." [...] Talk show host Larry King expressed approval of the movie, despite its uncertain conclusion. He wrote in USA Today: [...] "The ending is something I'm still thinking about and if they accomplished that, I guess it worked." [...] In a 2016 interview, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman said after being asked which film he would want with him on a deserted island, [...] "A movie I really love is Barton Fink. I don’t know if that’s the movie I’d take to a desert island, but I feel like there’s so much in there, you could watch it again and again. That’s important to me, especially if that was the only movie I’d have with <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the launch, Blair {{announced}} that he would give the £4.6m advance and all royalties from his memoirs to a sports centre for injured soldiers. In an interview with Jonathon Gatehouse, he conceded, [...] "You wouldn't be human if you didn't feel both a sense of responsibility and a deep sadness for those who have lost their lives. That responsibility stays with me now, and will stay with <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> my life. You know, I came to office as prime minister in 1997, focusing on domestic policy and ended up in four conflicts – Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. And it does change you, and so it should." [...] BBC political correspondent Norman Smith said Blair's severest critics would see the donation as [...] "guilt money" [...] for taking the UK to war against Iraq in 2003. The father of a soldier killed there decried the donation as [...] "blood money", while the father of another serviceman who died said Blair had a [...] "guilty conscience." [...] A spokesperson for the Stop the War Coalition supported with the donation, but added, [...] "No proportion of Tony Blair's massive and ill-gotten fortune can buy him innocence or forgiveness. He took this country to war on a series of lies against the best legal advice and in defiance of majority opinion." [...] A spokesman for Blair said that it had long been his intention to give the money to a charity; he added aiding soldiers undergoing rehabilitation at the Battle Back Challenge Centre was [...] "his way of honouring their courage and sacrifice." [...] The announcement was welcomed by Chris Simpkins, director general of The Royal British Legion, who said, [...] "Mr Blair's generosity is much appreciated and will help us to make a real and lasting difference to the lives of hundreds of injured personnel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Still, {{she often}} floundered {{about what to}} do and how to spend her time ("drifting" [...] was the word she {{frequently}} used), always struggling with her many eccentricities, and her lifelong melancholy and moodiness. As she approached her sixtieth birthday, she told a frequent walking companion [...] "In a few days, it will be the anniversary of the sorrow that never leaves me, that will never leave <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> my life." [...] To another friend, she said, in 1971, [...] "I suppose I suffer from very deep depression." [...] It is also arguable, says one biographer, that she was bipolar. [...] "I am very happy one moment, the next there is nothing left for me," [...] she said in 1933.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it is damp; but {{you know}} I am very strong and damp will not hurt <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> you need not be afraid, Mr. Quatermain. I did not lose my mind. It was taken from me by some power and sent to live elsewhere. Now it has been given back and I {{do not think it}} will be taken again in that way." ...|$|R
60|$|Certainly she did {{cling to}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> all <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of that terrible day, {{as will be}} seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{does not}} trouble me either. Absolutely disinterested friends I do not seek, as I should only find them among idiots or somnambulists. As {{to those whose}} {{interests}} are base, {{they do not know}} how to conceal their motives from <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> I am not so unreasonable as to object to a fair account being taken of my wealth in estimating the value of my friendship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Duchesse, I was {{a clumsy}} idiot!" [...] Peter {{declared}} penitently. [...] "I deserve {{that you should}} be unkind to <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the voyage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} had a month of it; and I'm having now, if you want to know," [...] Strether continued, [...] "enough to last <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> my days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He has {{kissed my}} hand," [...] she said. [...] "Does {{that tell you}} enough? Don't let him sit next me on the way home! I have borne all I can bear--spare <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come she can, {{if she has}} the heart," [...] said Skallagrim, [...] "though I put little {{trust in}} women's hearts. Still, I ride down to Middalhof, and thou, Jon, shalt go with <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> I charge you watch your lord; for, if I come back and find {{anything}} amiss, that shall be the death of some, and if I do not come back but perish on the road, yet I will haunt you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd buy {{her with}} all the rest,--a girl that wouldn't look at me as I am,--would take <b>me</b> <b>for</b> all <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> you know,--that's <b>the</b> way of the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|Prometheus. [...] No child, forsooth, [...] But {{yet more}} foolish than a foolish child, [...] If thou expect that I should answer aught [...] Thy Zeus can ask. No torture {{from his hand}} [...] Nor any machination in the world [...] Shall force mine {{utterance}} ere he loose, himself, [...] These cankerous fetters from <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> [...] Let him now hurl his blanching lightnings down, [...] And with his white-winged snows and mutterings deep [...] Of subterranean thunders mix all things, [...] Confound them in disorder. None of this [...] Shall bend my sturdy will and make me speak [...] The name of his dethroner who shall come.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a {{much more}} arduous life in front of you, dear," [...] he said. [...] "You have to come and look after <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> your days. A {{bachelor}} who marries as late in life as I do, you know, is a trying sort of person." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Saturday.--Marked {{forever in}} my {{calendar}} as the memorable day {{on which the}} judgment descended on me. Toward {{three o'clock in the}} afternoon--in the broad sunlight, under the cloudless sky, with hundreds of innocent human creatures all around me--I, Hester Dethridge, saw, for the first time, the Appearance which is appointed to haunt <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> my life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Does he see no difference," [...] {{she broke}} out, [...] "between his {{position}} and mine? What consolation--in God's name, what consolation is left to <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> my life but my child? And he threatens to separate us for six months in every year! And he takes credit to himself for an act of exalted justice on his part! Is there {{no such thing as}} shame in the hearts of men?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Glad! {{of course}} I am,' {{returned}} Humfrey; 'I never wished to obtrude my feelings on you after I knew how it stood with you. It {{would have been}} a shame. Your choice went far above <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> if to find you disposed towards me at the last makes me so happy,' and he looked at her again with beaming affection, 'how could I have borne to leave you if all had been as I wished? No, no, it is best as it is. You lose nothing in position, and you are free to begin the world again, not knocked down or crushed.' ...|$|R
60|$|They {{looked me}} over with frank curiosity, as though I were {{some sort of}} a strange animal, and then ignored <b>me</b> utterly <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of my wait. Then Johnny Upright himself arrived, and I was summoned upstairs to confer with him.|$|R
60|$|BLANCO. No; and {{you looked}} so disgusting that I wonder it didn't set <b>me</b> against drink <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of my life.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} pretend to {{describe}} what hot and cold fever-fits tormented <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the night, through broken sleep, weary vigils, and that dubious state which forms the neutral ground between them. A hundred terrible objects appeared to haunt me; but there was the great difference betwixt the vision which I have described, and those which followed, that I knew the last to be deceptions of my own fancy and over-excited nerves.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down, Anne, sit down," [...] said Mr. Harrison {{in a tone}} but two degrees {{removed from}} that which Avonlea people used at funerals. [...] "Emily's gone over to Carmody with Rachel Lynde [...] . she's struck up a lifelong {{friendship}} already with Rachel Lynde. Beats all how contrary women are. Well, Anne, my easy times are over [...] . all over. It's neatness and tidiness for <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> my natural life, I suppose." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{the captain}} had filled his pipe from Dick's bag he lighted it and gave a few puffs. [...] "It isn't a bit better than mine," [...] said he, [...] "but I will keep on and smoke it. Dick, let's go and take a walk over the hills. I feel rather stupid to-day. And, by the way, I hope {{you will be able}} to stay with <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> your vacation. Have you made plans to go {{anywhere}} else?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis bliss to be a bachelor, sir," [...] he said, gazing on the {{resinous}} {{trunk of}} an old damson tree. [...] "I gorge, I guzzle; I am merry, am melancholy; studious, harmonical, drowsy,--and none to scold or deny <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> why, youth is vain: yet youth had pleasure--innocence and delight. I chew the cud of many a peaceful acre. Ay, I have nibbled roses in my time. But now, what now? I have lived so long far from courts and courtesy, grace and fashion, and am so much my own close and indifferent friend--Why! he is happy who has solitude for housemate, company for guest. I say it, I say it; I marry daily wives of memory's fashioning, and dream at peace." ...|$|R
60|$|It was chilly, and Gen. Deems lent me his {{overcoat}} until night. He came {{a few minutes}} ago--5.45 P.M., and got it, but brought Gen. Willard, who lent <b>me</b> his <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of my stay, and will get another for himself when he goes home to dinner. Mine is much too heavy for this warm weather.|$|R
6000|$|Observe, I am no Napoleonist. I am {{simply a}} democrat, and hold that the {{majority}} of a nation has the right of choice upon the question of its own government, even where it makes a mistake. Therefore the outcry of the English newspapers is most disgusting to <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> one can hardly do strict justice, at this time of transition, to the ultimate situation of the country; we must really wait a little, till the wind and rain shall have ceased to dash so in one's eyes. The wits go on talking, though, all the same; and I heard a suggestion yesterday, that, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> effaced 'Liberté, égalité, fraternité,' should be written up, 'Infanterie, cavallerie, artillerie.' That's the last 'mot,' I believe. The salons are very noisy. A lady was ordered to her country seat <b>the</b> other day <b>for</b> exclaiming, 'Et il n'y a pas de Charlotte Corday.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is what I {{have been}} wanting all the time," [...] said I, and then without more ado {{the little white}} figure rose and flung itself at <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the night he lay on me and across me, and {{sometimes}} his feet were {{at the bottom of}} the bed and sometimes on the pillow, but he always retained possession of my finger, and occasionally he woke me to say that he was sleeping with me. I had not a good night. I lay thinking.|$|E
6000|$|The old lady's consternation, {{when she}} {{discovered}} that I looked hopefully forward to a coming extermination of kings and priests, and a general re-distribution of property all over the civilized globe, is unutterable in words. On that occasion, I made one more aristocrat tremble. I also closed Miss Batchford's door on <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> my life. No matter! The day is coming when the Batchford branch of humanity will not possess a door to close. All Europe is drifting nearer and nearer to the Pratolungo programme. Cheer up, my brothers without land, and my sisters without money in the Funds! We will have {{it out with the}} infamous rich yet. Long live the Republic! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next few}} hours {{completed}} my education. I saw that I ought to be afraid, but more clearly (this was when a liner hooted {{down the back of}} my neck) that any fear which would begin to do justice to the situation would, if yielded to, incapacitate <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> my days. A shadow of spread sails, deeper than the darkening twilight, brooding over us like the wings of Azrael (Pyecroft said she was a Swede), and, miraculously withdrawn, persuaded me that there was a working chance that I should reach the beach--any beach--alive, if not dry; and (this was when an economical tramp laved our port-rail with her condenser water) were I so spared, I vowed I would tell my tale worthily.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't blame me; don't grieve <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> Read <b>the</b> <b>rest.</b> I {{want you}} to think of this with my thoughts--to feel about it as I feel at this moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{a social}} one," [...] he assured her. [...] "A matter of {{business}} which I fear will take <b>me</b> from you <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of <b>the</b> evening. So let us {{make the most}} of the time until he comes." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{they finally}} left <b>me</b> I lay <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of <b>the</b> day stupid and half- comatose. There {{is such a}} thing as {{anaesthesia}} of pain, engendered by pain too exquisite to be borne. And I have known that anaesthesia.|$|R
