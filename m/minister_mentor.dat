Nathan and later to S. Vijayaratnam & S. Jothiratnam (nephews & Rajaratnam's closest relatives). The Singapore National Pledge was recited by the mourners in honour of Rajaratnam, who penned down the National Pledge {{against the backdrop of}} racial riots in the 1950s and 1960s to inculcate in all Singaporeans his vision of building one united Singapore regardless of race, language or religion.|$|E

25|$|There were {{suggestions}} to divest SIA Engineering Company and Singapore Airport Terminal Services, two of SIA's largest subsidiaries. Former <b>Minister</b> <b>Mentor</b> Lee Kuan Yew, for one, voiced his opinion in December 2005 that Singapore Airlines should divest these two companies {{to focus on}} its core business of air transportation. Singapore Airlines has evaluated the divestment opportunity and Singapore Airport Terminal Services (which was renamed as SATS Group) was diversified from the group on 1 September 2009.|$|E
25|$|The Singapore government, {{which holds}} a golden share via the Ministry of Finance, has {{regularly}} stressed its non-involvement {{in the management}} of the company, a point emphasised by <b>Minister</b> <b>Mentor</b> Lee Kuan Yew when he declared that the aviation hub status of Singapore Changi Airport will be defended, even at the cost of SIA. However, he was personally involved in defusing tensions between the company and its pilots, warned the airline to cut costs, and made public his advice to the airline to divest from its subsidiary companies.|$|E

2500|$|During Lee's 2011 book release Lee Kuan Yew: Hard Truths to Keep Singapore Going. In the book, Lee {{stated that}} Singaporean Muslims faced {{difficulties}} in integrating {{because of their}} religion, and urged them to [...] "be less strict on Islamic observances". His remarks drew firestorm from Malay/Muslim leaders and MPs in Singapore, prompting a strong reaction from his son Lee Hsien Loong, who's the current Prime Minister at that time as saying [...] "My views on Muslims’ integration in Singapore differed from the <b>Minister</b> <b>Mentor's.</b> Muslims are a valued and respected community, who have done a good deal to strengthen our harmony and social cohesion." [...] Lee Kuan Yew then told the media [...] "I made this one comment on the Muslims integrating with other communities probably {{two or three years}} ago. Ministers and MPs, both Malay and non-Malay, have since told me that Singapore Malays have indeed made special efforts to integrate with the other communities, especially since 9/11, and that my call is out of date." [...] Subsequently, he adds [...] "I stand corrected. I hope that this trend will continue in the future." ...|$|R
25|$|Today, the Istana is the {{official}} residence of the President of Singapore. However, no presidents nor cabinet ministers have lived there after the tenure of Devan Nair, the third President of Singapore. The villas, which {{are meant to be}} used for foreign heads of state, are used rarely. The Istana building and its grounds {{are open to the public}} on five selected statutory holidays– Chinese New Year, Deepavali, Hari Raya Puasa, Labour Day and National Day. Due to the closeness of Deepavali and Hari Raya Puasa in some years, the grounds of the Istana are sometimes open only once during this period in commemoration of both public holidays. The grounds are also often used for state functions and ceremonial occasions such as swearings-in, investitures and the presentation of credentials by heads of foreign missions. The Prime Minister, Senior Minister and <b>Minister</b> <b>Mentor</b> have their offices in the Istana Annex.|$|E
25|$|After {{attending}} the London School of Economics, Lee graduated from Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge University, with double starred-first-class honours in law. In 1950, {{he became a}} barrister of the Middle Temple and practised law until 1959. Lee co-founded the People's Action Party (PAP) in 1954 and was its first secretary-general until 1992, leading the party to eight consecutive victories. After Lee chose to step down as Prime Minister in 1990, he served as Senior Minister under his successor, Goh Chok Tong until 2004, then as <b>Minister</b> <b>Mentor</b> (an advisory post) until 2011, under his son Lee Hsien Loong. In total, Lee held successive ministerial positions for 56 years. He continued to serve his Tanjong Pagar constituency for nearly 60 years as a Member of Parliament {{until his death in}} 2015. From 1991, he helmed the 5-member Tanjong Pagar GRC, and was returned unopposed for a record five elections.|$|E

40|$|The Śaiva Siddhānta Church (ŚSC), {{based in}} Kauai HI, USA, has been holding rites of {{conversion}} to Hinduism since the 1960 s. These rites include studying one’s “former” religion, officially declaring severance {{from it in}} the presence of a <b>minister</b> or <b>mentor,</b> choosing and officially adopting a new Hindu name as well as aligning with “the Hindu community”. Starting from here, this paper will address the question of community with respect to (1) the meanings of the term, (2) the idea of Hinduism as “a global religion” upheld by numerous “communities” worldwide and (3) the relevance of “community” in the conversion process. For doing so, I will draw on source material published by the Himalayan Academy, a branch of the ŚSC, in the global magazine Hinduism Today, in book publications and on their various websites...|$|R
5|$|However, once {{he learned}} that a betrothal had finally been arranged, the Emperor ended his {{relationship}} to Domitila. She returned to her native province of São Paulo on 27 August, where she remained. Days earlier, on 2 August, the Emperor had been married by proxy to Amélie of Leuchtenberg. He was stunned by her beauty after meeting her in person. The vows previously made by proxy were ratified in a Nuptial Mass on 17 October. Amélie was kind and loving to his children and provided a much needed sense of normality to both his family and the general public. After Domitila's banishment from court, the vow the Emperor made to alter his behavior proved to be sincere. He had no more affairs and remained faithful to his spouse. In an attempt to mitigate and move beyond other past misdeeds, he made peace with José Bonifácio, his former <b>minister</b> and <b>mentor.</b>|$|R
40|$|American Indian (AI) law {{enforcement}} officers. Extended Case Method (Burawoy, 1991) {{was used to}} investigate complex patterns of coping over time, with intergenerational historical trauma, or soul wound (Duran, 1990; Duran & Duran, 1995; Duran et al., 1998). Specifically, the study sought to examine how this vocation might provide a culturally congruent vehicle of reparations for AI officers working in non-AI settings, and further, how the career might facilitate and/or hinder healing of soul wound. The study results indicated that participants saw their {{law enforcement}} roles as congruent with traditional warrior roles, particularly the role aspects of <b>minister</b> and <b>mentor</b> to the people, and that fulfilling the traditional AI warrior role via a career in law enforcement held a spiritual meaning for those who participated. The present study has implications for expanding vocational and ethno-cultural theories {{in the field of}} psychology, and for restructuring theoretical and methodological options for research on AIs, traumatized populations, culture/ethnicity, and vocation. The Career-Healing Process Model is presented for addressing how participants negotiate their individual needs, community orientated values, AI culture/worldview and mainstream culture/worldview in an effort to achieve career satisfaction. Limits and implications are presented in the discussion section...|$|R
500|$|Speaking at the Singapore Energy Conference on 4 November 2008, <b>Minister</b> <b>Mentor</b> Lee Kuan Yew {{mentioned}} that the Singapore Government had considered reclaiming land and building {{a nuclear power plant}} on Pedra Branca. Such a plant could not be built on the main island of Singapore as international standards require a safety zone of [...] around the plant. However, it was recognised that this was probably not feasible as Pedra Branca is less than 30kilometres from the Malaysian coast.|$|E
500|$|Woon was {{the first}} Attorney-General in {{more than ten years}} to {{personally}} appear in court. On 28 July 2008, he argued before the Court of Appeal that a woman who had manipulated her teenage lover into killing her husband should be given a life sentence. The Court held that a life sentence was inappropriate due to the defendant's psychiatric condition, and affirmed the nine-year jail term imposed by the High Court. Woon elected to take proceedings against Tang Wee Sung, chairman of the company C.K. Tang which owns Tangs department store, for the illegal purchase of a human organ– a kidney– in the first case of its kind in Singapore. The decision to do so was criticised by Dr. Lee Wei Ling, Director of the National Neuroscience Institute and daughter of <b>Minister</b> <b>Mentor</b> and former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, in an article published in The Straits Times on 5 September 2008. Woon replied, pointing out a number of misconceptions she held as to the facts and the law, and emphasising that the prosecution had been brought as no one was above the law. Subsequently, in response to further comments by Dr. Lee, he wrote an extended article entitled [...] "Wrong Facts and Faulty Logic" [...] that appeared in The Straits Times on 18 September 2008.|$|E

Artist Ong Hui Har's Harry exhibition at The Arts House featured pop art paintings of Lee in his youth.|$|E
5000|$|The tomb of Lord Samuel von Behr (died 1621) {{was built}} by Julius Döteber from Leipzig and the canopy was erected in 1626 by Cheer Evert Pilot. Samuel von Behr was chancellor, marshal, <b>minister,</b> manager and <b>mentor</b> of Duke Adolf Friedrich who had this {{memorial}} erected in gratitude to his mentor. To {{the right of the}} chapel and opposite, the swan and antlers remind us of the abbey's founding legend. After the first abbey was destroyed, Duke Nikolaus from Rostock looked for a new building site for the abbey. The new abbey's building site would be the place where the first stag was killed in the hunt. The Prince killed the stag here. The monks surveying the site thought that this ground would be too wet as it was swampland. However suddenly a swan rose out of a thicket into the air and shouted [...] "dobr, dobr" [...] (Slavic = good) which the monks took as a sign from God, and decided to build the abbey on that spot. [...] "dobr" [...] -> Doberan (Slavic = good place).|$|R
2500|$|From {{the decade}} of the 2000s, Lee {{expressed}} concern about the declining proficiency of Mandarin among younger Chinese Singaporeans. In one of his parliamentary speeches, he said: [...] "Singaporeans must learn to juggle English and Mandarin". Subsequently, in December 2004, Lee step down to another level, becoming a <b>minister</b> <b>mentor</b> and a year-long campaign called 华语 Cool! (Huayu Cool!) was launched, in an attempt to attract young viewers to learn and speak Mandarin.|$|E
2500|$|During the controversy, PAP raised {{questions}} about the credibility of James Gomez. He was also accused of attempting to discredit the Elections Department by claiming they misplaced the form. Despite not having enough concrete video or audio evidence, Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng and <b>Minister</b> <b>Mentor</b> Lee Kuan Yew called James Gomez a [...] "liar" [...] and Lee Kuan Yew dared Gomez to sue him and Wong Kan Seng. George Yeo (PAP) also suggested that the Worker's Party should sack Gomez and field a four-member team for the five-member Group Representation Constituency.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 April 2007 {{the airline}} group and its unions jointly {{launched}} the [...] "Singapore Airlines Group Union-Management Partnership" [...] and the Labour Movement 2011 (LM2011) {{in a bid}} to improve their relations, each pledging to be [...] "pro-worker" [...] and [...] "pro-business" [...] respectively. In April 2008, the airline's chairman Stephen Lee described the relations between management and the unions as [...] "stable and cordial" [...] in the last two years, with better communication between them. He alluded that several government figures, including <b>Minister</b> <b>Mentor</b> Lee Kuan Yew, has intervened to help alleviate differences, and that there has been more regular meetings and exchanges between the two sides.|$|E
2500|$|This {{prompted}} a reply from Mr Chee Hong Tat, the Principal Private Secretary of <b>Minister</b> <b>Mentor</b> Lee Kuan Yew. In {{a letter to}} the editor in the Straits Times Forum, he underlined the importance of English and Mandarin over other Chinese varieties and how using these varieties [...] "interferes with the learning of Mandarin and English"; a statement that Mr Lee Kuan Yew later corroborated in a speech at the 30th anniversary of the Speak Mandarin Campaign. Referring to the progress of Singapore's bilingual education policy over the decades, Mr Chee Hong Tat also commented that [...] "it would be stupid for any Singapore agency or NTU to advocate the learning of dialects, which must be at the expense of English and Mandarin." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong {{wrote in}} his letter of condolence to Mrs. Tiwari that her husband [...] "did much to advance Singapore's {{interests}} internationally. He was a determined, patient and skilful negotiator. He held his own against diplomats and lawyers from other countries and could be counted upon to deliver results for Singapore." [...] In a tribute published in The Straits Times on 27 July 2010, Senior Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for National Security S. Jayakumar said that Tiwari [...] "was much respected, not just by {{his colleagues in the}} Singapore public service, but in Asean and internationally. Whether negotiating bilateral agreements or at international conferences, he achieved the reputation among other delegations as a tough, fair-minded and skilful negotiator." [...] <b>Minister</b> <b>Mentor</b> Lee Kuan Yew said in a condolence letter of 29 July that [...] "Singapore has lost an outstanding legal public officer".|$|E
2500|$|On 18 August 2009, Viswa Sadasivan moved {{a motion}} for Parliament to reaffirm [...] "its {{commitment}} to the nation building tenets as enshrined in the National Pledge when debating national policies, especially economic policies". He identified one of the tenets of the Pledge as the need to strive to become a [...] "united people, regardless of race, language or religion", and expressed the view that Singaporean society needed to address [...] "apparent contradictions and mixed signals" [...] by unnecessarily emphasizing racial differences. He gave examples where this had occurred: the existence of ethnic based self-help groups, Special Assistance Plan schools and cultural elitism; policies concerning Malay-Muslims in the Singapore Armed Forces and maintaining the current racial distribution in the population; and discussions about whether Singapore was ready for an ethnic minority Prime Minister. The next day, <b>Minister</b> <b>Mentor</b> Lee Kuan Yew refuted what he termed Viswa's [...] "false and flawed" [...] arguments, saying he wanted to [...] "bring the House back to earth" [...] {{on the issue of}} racial equality in Singapore. He noted that Articles 152 and 153 of the Constitution, which make it the Government's responsibility to care for racial and religious minorities and to recognize the special position of Malays as the indigenous people of Singapore, explicitly impose a duty on the Government not to treat everyone equally. He felt that the tenet in the Pledge that Viswa had referred to was only an aspiration: [...] "It is not reality, it is not practical, it will lead to grave and irreparable damage if we work on that principle. ... e are trying to reach a position where there is a level playing field for everybody which is going to take decades, if not centuries, and we may never get there." [...] Thus, it was not feasible to dismantle institutions that provided assistance to Singaporeans on an ethnic basis. It was the first time since 2007 that Lee had chosen to speak during a debate in Parliament.|$|E
