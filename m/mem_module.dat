50|$|The Mars Excursion <b>Module</b> (<b>MEM)</b> was a {{spacecraft}} proposed by NASA in the 1960s {{for use in}} a manned mission to Mars. It formed part of Mars orbit rendezvous (MOR) and flyby-rendezvous mission profiles studied at NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center in the 1960s. The Mars Excursion Module would have been a combination of a Mars lander, short-stay surface habitat, and ascent vehicle; the ascent stage performed the rendezvous. The MEM would have been used for a 40-day stay on the Martian surface in the flyby-rendezvous mission profile or for a 10- to 40-day stay in the MOR profiles.|$|R

The focus is on a manned Mars mission occurring in the late 1990 's. Discussions on the Trans-Mars Vehicle, the Mars Excursion <b>Module</b> (<b>MEM),</b> and a Martian base facility are covered. The functions, performance requirements, and design loads of a typical ECLSS are listed, and the issues and technology briefly discussed. Several ECLSS concepts and options are identified, and comparative weights and volumes are provided for these.

40|$|Global {{positioning}} system (GPS) offers a perfect {{solution to the}} 3 -dimension(3 D) navigation. However, the GPS-only solution can’t provide continuous and accurate position information in the unfavourable environments, such as urban canyons, indoor buildings, dense foliages due to signal blockage, interference, or jamming etc. A pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) system integrating the self-contained inertial sensors with GPS receiver is proposed to provide a seamless outdoor/indoor 3 D pedestrian navigation. The <b>MEM</b> sensor <b>module</b> attached to the user’s waist is composed of a 3 -axis accelerometer, a 3 -axis gyroscope, a 3 -axis digital compass and a barometric pressure sensor, which doesn’t rely on any infrastructure. The positioning algorithm implements a loosely coupled GPS/PDR integration. The sensor data are fused via a complementary filter to reduce the integral drift and magnetic disturbance for accurate heading. The four key components of the PDR algorithm: step detection, stride length estimation, heading and position determination are described in detail and implemented by the microcontroller. The step is detected using the accelerometer signals by the combination of three approaches: sliding window, peak detection and zero-crossing. The step length is estimated using a simple linear relationship with the step frequency. By coupling the step length, azimuth and height, 3 D navigation is achieved. The performance of the proposed system is carefully verified through several field outdoor and indoor walking tests. The positioning errors are below 3 % of the total traveled distance. The main error source comes from th...|$|R
5000|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{they live}} in on the journey to Mars does the flyby, but the crew separates and goes into a lander. The Excursion module's ascent stage must rejoin the main spacecraft before it gets too far away. An advantage is that the resources needed for Earth return don't have to enter and leave Mars orbit, but the ascent stage has to perform space rendezvous in solar orbit and the time on Mars is constrained {{by the need to}} this. Mars cyclers orbit the Sun {{in such a way as}} to pass by Mars and the Earth on regular intervals, performing Mars flybys on regular intervals. The crews would live on the stations during the interplanetary voyages. The concept for Flyby Excursion Landing Module is that a lander and flyby would separate in solar orbit, the lander would accelerate to get to Mars first, then land on Mars meanwhile the other segment does a Mars flyby, then the lander takes off and rendezvous with the flyby segment transferring the crew over.

40|$|This paper briefly {{describes}} three modes for accomplishing the Mars landing {{mission and}} compares {{them on a}} gross basis to indicate their probable order of merit and to identify design requirements placed on the Mars-excursion <b>module</b> (<b>MEM)</b> by the choice of mode. The paper shows that a flyby-rendezvous mode requiring low weight in earth orbit requires the MEM to enter the Mars atmosphere at velocities ranging from 20, 000 to 30, 000 ft/sec. The MEM for the flyby-rendezvous mode is not covered in this paper but merits further study. The MEM for the other modes of mission accomplishment begins its active operational sequence in Mars orbit and need not be greatly influenced by the method of delivery to Mars orbit. Parametric studies of the entry problem for two vehicles typifying a ballistic-type and a lifting-body-type were conducted to identify {{the problems associated with}} design of a MEM to accommodate the extremes of Mars atmospheric density presently predicted. This brief study indicates that: (a) the presently predicted density extremes of the Mars atmosphere present no serious design problems for a MEM which can operate across the entire band of predicted densities; (b) details of operational requirements and mission objectives will control the choice of configuration rather than entry requirements; and (c) the ballistic-type MEM is lighter and simpler but has less operational flexibility than a high L/D MEM...|$|R
40|$|The Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) Main Electronics <b>Module</b> (<b>MEM)</b> {{power supply}} heat sink {{temperature}} {{is critical to}} the Landsat- 7 mission. It is strongly dependent on the thermal louver design. A lower power supply heat sink temperature increases the reliability of the MEM, and reduces the risk of over heating and thermal shut-down. After the power supply failures in ETM+ instrument thermal vacuum tests # 1 and # 2, the author performed detailed thermal analyses of the MEM, and proposed to reduce the louver set-points by 7 C. At the 1998 Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference (IECEC), the author presented a paper that included results of thermal analysis of the MEM. It showed that a 70 C reduction of the louver set points could reduce the maximum power supply heat sink temperature in thermal vacuum test and in flight to below 20 "C in the cooler outgas mode and in the nominal imaging mode, and has no significant impact on the standby heater duty cycle. It also showed that the effect of Earth infrared and albedo on the power supply heat sink temperature is small. The louver set point reduction was implemented in June 1998, just prior to ETM+ thermal vacuum test # 3. Results of the thermal vacuum tests, and temperature data in flight validate the MEM thermal performance improvement due to the 70 C reduction of the louver set points...|$|R
