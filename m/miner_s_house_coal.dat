50|$|The Ingleton Coalfield {{is about}} six miles long by four miles wide lying {{mostly in the}} parish of Ingleton {{extending}} into the neighbouring parishes of Burton in Lonsdale and Thornton-in-Lonsdale. The coalfield terminates at the South Craven fault. The coal measures are shallow and represent the lowest layers in the Pennine coal measures sequence. The earliest coal mining occurred along the River Greta where Four Foot and Six Foot seams outcrop. Most deep mining was at New Ingleton Pit sunk in 1913. Its sinking led {{to the discovery of}} the Ten Foot seam (<b>house</b> and steam <b>coal)</b> at 127 yards, and the Nine Foot seam (steam and <b>house</b> <b>coal)</b> at 134 yards. Beneath them are the Four Foot seam (house, gas and coking coal) at 233 yards, the Three Foot or Yard seam (<b>house</b> and gas <b>coal)</b> at 236 yards and the Six Foot seam (steam and <b>house</b> <b>coal)</b> at 260 yards. Commercially viable deposits of fireclay lay under the Three Foot seam and pottery clay beneath the Six Foot seam used to make Ingleton Bricks.|$|R

40|$|Objective High-risk antepartum {{patients}} {{often require}} long and costly hospitalization. The Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House</b> facility {{has been used}} to house antepartum women on hospital property as an alternative to inpatient management. This study looked at the cost effectiveness of this facility. Study Design A retrospective chart review on occupants (n = 3 D 111) of the Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House</b> from 2003 - 2005 was performed. Admission, discharge, and outcome data were collected. A comparison of the cost of management at the Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House</b> with the estimated cost of inpatient management was then performed. Results A cost savings of 2. 1 million was seen over a 3 -year period {{with the use of the}} Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House.</b> Demographic data show that patients with positive drug screens are more likely to fail Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House</b> management. Conclusion The Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House</b> is a cost effective alternative to inpatient management of some antepartum patients.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{existence}} of a U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> price bubble. Specifically, we focus on the time series statistical relationship between real U. <b>S.</b> and regional <b>house</b> prices and a number of fundamental economic variables related to house prices using quarterly data from the first quarter of 1975 through the second-quarter of 2005, the approximate end of the recent house price rise. We find that U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> prices and our fundamental economic variables are unit root variables that are not cointegrated, even after allowing for structural breaks. Thus our analysis confirms the existence of an interesting and important anomaly suggested by some prior research on this period. We then discuss the implications of our results for the common practice of using error correction models of house prices, and for the current policy debate regarding the causes of the recent U. <b>S.</b> <b>housing</b> market collapse.

40|$|Abstract: The U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> {{price boom}} {{has been linked}} to an {{unsustainable}} easing of mortgage lending standards. However, time series models of U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> prices ignore changes in mortgage lending standards and perform poorly in the 2000 s. We incorporate data on mortgage standards for first time buyers into a model of US house prices based on the (inverted) demand for housing services. Our first time buyer loan-to-value series is weakly exogenous. It captures shifts in the supply of mortgage credit and not expectations of future house price appreciation. Using this series, we estimate a U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> price equation that yields a stable long-run cointegrating relationship, plausible income and price elasticities and an improved fit. Our findings suggest that swings in credit standards played a major, if not the major, role in driving the recent boom and bust in U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> prices...|$|R
