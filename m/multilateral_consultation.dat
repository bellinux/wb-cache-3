40|$|Ths thesis {{presents}} {{an interpretation of}} the forniation process of the post-Cold War international order with special reference to the Western debate regarding use of coercive power in the Bosnian conflict of 1992 - 1995. As the role of multilateralism and the authority of the UN were the most contentious issues of the debate, this thesis will provide a critical resource for comprehending the origin and the nature of 'American unflateralism',and its relationship with other Western allies. It will also be a useful tool in predicting future outcomes. This research will apply the concept of 'Quasi-multflater-alism' to analyse the relationship between the US and other Western states during the Bosnian conflict. It is held that the US justified its policies in the name of collective action without adhering to the outcomes of genuine <b>multilateral</b> <b>consultation</b> with its allies. However, this inevitably undermined th e quality of justice that the West alleged to promote. More specifically, this work will analyse {{the fact that there was}} a clear tension between Western states who sought to legitimize their role in international order based on shared values,and thus it will argue that the content of 'Western Value' was a product of power politics. Accordingly, this research will conclude that America's interpretation of justice was used as a means to project its own national interest under the logic of Quasi-multilateralism. This thesis will challenge the Liberal view of the present world order that Western states have common interests in promoting democracy and market economies across the globe and implementation of those Western values will make the world safer and fairer.

40|$|The IMF {{presents}} {{multilateral surveillance}} {{as one of}} its core responsibilities and has recently sought to enhance this role via a series of <b>multilateral</b> <b>consultations</b> with systemically important countries, designed to coordinate exchange rate and macroeconomic policy {{in order to reduce the}} global economic imbalances that threaten the stability of the international financial system. The authors examine the evolution of the IMF's multilateral surveillance and assess what it has achieved. They also investigate what may reasonably be expected from surveillance and, in the light of this analysis, evaluate the outcome of the <b>multilateral</b> <b>consultations.</b> Concluding that there are strict limits on what the Fund can achieve in terms of using multilateral surveillance to avoid economic and financial crises, they also explore areas relating to crisis management where the IMF might be able to make a more important contribution. The Fund needs to temper ambition with reality if it is to maintain credibility as an international financial institution. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Policymakers in the US, Asia and Europe {{should not}} wait until {{financial}} markets force adjustment {{in the large}} imbalances in global current account positions. Although <b>multilateral</b> <b>consultations</b> organised by the IMF began in Summer 2006, {{they have yet to}} be followed by policy actions. The current stalemate is dangerous, as market participants are likely to change their minds at some stage about the sustainability of imbalances. Indications that the main players are able to agree on the direction of desirable domestic policy changes and are willing to accept the exchange rate implications of global current account adjustment would help make this adjustment orderly. The time for action is now...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{argues that}} the reorientation of US foreign policy under the Bush/Cheney administration towards unilateralism and pre-emptive military "hard" power fundamentally challenges the transatlantic consensus between Europe and America. This applies in particular to the traditionally close bilateral relations between the US and Germany, which were based on <b>multilateral</b> <b>consultations</b> and co-operation {{within the framework of}} NATO. The German foreign policy approach of multilateral responsibility, developed under the red-green coalition after 1998, which combines the post-WW 2 German foreign policy tradition of "soft" power multilateral conflict resolution with the acceptance of full military burden-sharing with the NATO allies stands {{in stark contrast to the}} US strategy in the war against terror...|$|R
40|$|In {{this book}} Laurien Crump {{examines}} {{to what extent}} the Warsaw Pact inadvertently provided the non-Soviet Warsaw Pact (NSWP) members with an opportunity to assert their own interests, emancipate from the Soviet grip, and influence Warsaw Pact (WP) policy in the period 1960 - 1969. In the shadow of the increasingly urgent German Question and the escalating Sino-Soviet split, the alliance evolved into a body of <b>multilateral</b> <b>consultation,</b> in which the NSWP members not only obtained increasing leeway, but also managed to exercise leverage over the Soviet Union, which served the WP’s evolution into a multilateral alliance. Crump traces this development through six thematic case-studies, which focus on particular issues from a multilateral perspective, and analyses how the WP inadvertently developed a new dynamics in the 1960 s, which caused the emancipation of some NSWP countries and the multilateralisation of the alliance at large. The Albanian obstruction in 1961 heralded the alliance’s gravest crisis, and paved the way for Romanian emancipation from the Soviet Union. At the same time, the second Berlin Crisis enabled the East German and Polish leaders to use the alliance to assert their national interests, whereas the Kremlin was increasingly forced to adopt the position of a mediator. In {{the second half of the}} 1960 s the NSWP members’ clashing interests on issues such as the Vietnam War, non-proliferation, WP reforms and European Security determined the debates within the alliance. Although the invasion of five socialist countries in Czechoslovakia in August 1968 was conducted outside a WP framework, the fact that Romania did not participate exacerbated the differences between its members. This nevertheless sparked further debates, which surprisingly culminated in consolidation and consensus on WP reforms and the proposal for a European Security Conference in 1969. These genuinely contested compromises sealed the alliance’s evolution into a multilateral alliance. Empirical evidence accordingly suggests that the widely held assumption within historiography of the WP as a mere Soviet instrument is a misconception. This is not only the first monograph based on primary sources on the WP since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the ensuing opening of the Eastern European archives, but it is also unprecedented in its challenge of the unfounded, but persistent, assumption within historiography of the WP as a mere instrument of Soviet power. By analysing hitherto neglected archival evidence from archives in Berlin, Bucharest and Rome, and examining the Soviet alliance from a radically novel perspective, this dissertation aims to offer new insights into the multilateral dynamics of power within the Soviet bloc, while contributing to New Cold War history. This new angle is particularly overdue, since there is a sharp asymmetry between the scant study of the role of the Soviet Union’s Eastern-European allies in the WP and the amount of recent research on the influence of America’s Western-European allies in NATO. This book therefore also serves to shed a new light on the dynamics of alliances in general, which is an especially relevant issue at a time when alliances such as NATO face internal challenges...|$|E
40|$|The Hungarian Revolution {{is often}} {{analysed}} {{in a national}} context or from the angle of Hungarian-Soviet relations. From this perspective, the Eastern European satellites seem mere puppets and the Soviet bloc a monolith. Archival evidence nevertheless shows that the Kremlin actually attempted {{to build a new}} kind of international relations after Stalin’s death in 1953, in which the Eastern European leaders would gain more scope for manoeuvre. This attempt at liberalisation even facilitated the uprisings in Hungary in 1956. Avoiding a teleological approach to the Hungarian Revolution, this article argues that the Soviet invasion was neither inevitable, nor wholly unilateral. Khrushchev even sought to legitimise the invasion in bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>consultations.</b> There was a mutual interest in sacrificing Hungary’s sovereignty to safeguard the communist monopoly on power. This multilateralisation of Soviet bloc security is an important explanatory factor in an analysis of the Revolution and its repercussions in Eastern Europe...|$|R
5000|$|U.S. policy since 1983 {{provides}} that the United States will exercise and assert its navigation and overflight {{rights and freedoms}} on a worldwide basis {{in a manner that}} is consistent with the balance of interests reflected in the Law of the Sea (LOS) Convention. The United States will not, however, acquiesce in unilateral acts of other states designed to restrict the rights and freedoms of the international community in navigation and overflight and other related high seas uses. The FON Program since 1979 has highlighted the navigation provisions of the LOS Convention to further the recognition of the vital national need to protect maritime rights throughout the world. The FON Program operates on a triple track, involving not only diplomatic representations and operational assertions by U.S. military units, but also bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>consultations</b> with other governments in an effort to promote maritime stability and consistency with international law, stressing the need for and obligation of all States to adhere to the customary international law rules and practices reflected in the LOS Convention.|$|R

The Program of Seminars ends {{on this day}} and delegates discussed {{about the future of}} global economy, poverty and the future of Asia. Ministers {{of the members of the}} International Monetary Fund approved a plan to give more powers and voting rights to People's Republic of China, Mexico, South Korea and Turkey. This vote had 90.6% of the members supporting the move. However, the IMF remains dominated by Europe, the United States and Japan. China has less power in the IMF, although its economy is larger than Belgium and Netherlands combined. The IMF and World Bank have been criticised by Brazil, Argentina, Asian and African nations for prescribing severe belt-tightening measures during their economic crisis. The American government sees the reform of the IMF to redress global economic imbalances, which were cited as one of the biggest menaces to world growth. The IMF is stepping up in its financial surveillance through <b>multilateral</b> <b>consultations</b> to make it more effective and relevant. The World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz said that the poor should not be abandoned because their governments are weak, otherwise the people would be penalised twice. The IMF and World Bank see the need to combat corruption in developing countries. The World Bank will work with developing countries by working with countries or offered through projects on the countries itself. Wolfowitz said that the issue of governance is being addressed, and the most important thing is to take the principles in the paper, applying it in terms of budget allocation. Matters may be complicated due to lack of political will. He added that working with developing countries is a starting point and must work with banks, global organisations and other governments to stop corruption in their nations. African nations also called for more voting rights in the IMF for countries in their continent, at forums held in Africa itself.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how financial constraints in the United States are affecting {{its effort to}} 2 ̆ 7 rebalance 2 ̆ 7 towards Asia and the implication for Australia. Executive summaryWestern military spending has stabilised {{and in some cases}} declined after a period of rapid growth over the past decade, but this is not only a function of austerity. An expanding and diffuse set of security challenges are facing the United States (US) and its allies in Asia. The US will seek to build on its security framework to more effectively integrate economic, diplomatic, and cultural engagement. The US will ask its allies to take more responsibility for security, especially in their immediate neighbourhoods, but to do so while avoiding provocations. The US will want help from its allies to both assure and deter China. The current period of austerity will end and US fundamental economic strength remains. Policy recommendationsWork with US partners to define and build a more expansive and comprehensive mutual security framework at both political and working levels, to encompass greater engagement across the spectrum of the relationship: on trade and investment; greener energy solutions; diplomatic initiatives; people-to-people exchanges; education, innovation and science programs; and defence and security cooperation. Continue to engage and encourage active US participation in and commitment to effective, problem-oriented multilateral mechanisms in the region, both formal and informal, including <b>multilateral</b> collaborations, <b>consultations,</b> and joint activities amongst Australia, the US, and other allies and security partners. Give particular attention to collaboration and consultation with the US in and related to Southeast Asia. Generate new opportunities for bilateral security engagement in Australia and in Australia’s nearby region, including facilities sharing and access, prepositioning of US equipment, weapons and other defence technology trade and development, and joint deployments and training. Explore and where possible expand possibilities to strengthen Australian deployments to bilateral and multilateral operations alongside American forces. Take initiative to strengthen Australian bilateral security relationships with other non-US allies and partners. Deepen military-to-military and other security-related engagement with China and encourage greater trilateral security cooperation amongst Australia, China and the United States...|$|R
