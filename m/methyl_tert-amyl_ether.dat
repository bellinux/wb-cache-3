30|$|High {{viscosity}} at reservoir {{conditions is}} a major setback to heavy crude oil and bitumen recovery and transportation via pipelines. Thus, blending or dilution of heavy crude oil and bitumen to reduce viscosity {{is one of the}} several means to improve transportation via pipelines that is a most commonly used technique in the petroleum industry since the 1930 s. The blending fluid or diluents is always less viscous than the heavy crude and bitumen. Generally, it well know that the lower the viscosity of the diluents, the lower is the viscosity of the blended mixture of heavy crude and bitumen (Gateau et al. 2004). The widely used diluents include condensate from natural gas production, naphtha, kerosene, lighter crude oils, etc. However, the use of organic solvents such as alcohol, <b>methyl</b> tert-butyl <b>ether,</b> <b>tert-amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> has been investigated (Anhorn and Badakhshan 1994). The use of these solvents is prompted based on their use in improving the octane number of gasoline. Subsequently, a mixture of hydrocarbons and organic solvents with polar group in their molecular structure has shown some effectiveness in viscosity reduction of heavy crude oil at constant dilution rate (Gateau et al. 2004). The use of diluents allows the transportation of large quantity or volume of heavy crude oil and bitumen.|$|R

The potential of this technique is demonstrated and validated with the well-known, non-reactive systems methanol-ethanol and ethanol-water. The other (mainly reactive) binary mixtures investigated stem from two esterification systems (methyl formate and ethyl acetate production) and one etherification system (<b>tert-amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> production).

While carbenes are exclusively obtained from <b>tert-amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether,</b> sec-butyl methyl ether (SBME), n-butyl methyl ether (NBME), and tetrahydrofuran (THF), vinyl ethers or their adducts are observed upon reaction with diethyl ether and 1, 4 -dioxane.

The intermediates characterized for several of these reactions as well as the α,α-dehydrogenation of tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE) are used to outline a reaction pathway for the generation of PNP-supported iridium(I) carbene complexes, and it is shown that the long-lived, observable intermediates are substrate-dependent and differ for the related cases of MTBE and THF.

The effect of catalyst swelling was studied with several mixtures of reagents (MeOH and IA) and product (TAME) on Amberlyst 16. The particle size influenced the steady state reaction rates most notably at higher temperatures and with substoichiometric feed of the reagents (methanol/isoamylenes), i. e. when the reaction rate should be fast.

Recalculations of the earlier results of TAME-synthesis demonstrated that when modifying the rate constants obtained from the batch reactor experiments by dividing them by the effectiveness factors, the R-squared values of the regression analysis against temperature increased (improved fit for Arrhenius-type dependency) and the activation energies increased by about 9 kJ mol− 1...|$|R

Ethyl tert-butyl ether was weakly degraded. tert-Butyl formate and 2 -hydroxy isobutyrate (HIBA), two intermediates in the MTBE catabolism pathway, were detected during growth on MTBE. A positive effect of Co 2 + during growth of M. austroafricanum IFP 2012 on HIBA was demonstrated. The specific rate of MTBE degradation was 0. 6 mmol/h/g (dry weight) of cells, and the biomass yield on MTBE was 0. 44 g (dry weight) per g of MTBE. MTBE, TBA, and HIBA degradation activities were induced by MTBE and TBA, and TBA was a good inducer.

Inhalation is a major route for human exposure to MTBE and other gasoline ethers. The possible adverse effects of MTBE in humans are a public concern {{and some of the}} reported symptoms attributed to MTBE exposure appear to be related to olfactory sensation. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the olfactory mucosa of the male Sprague-Dawley rat possesses the highest microsomal activities, among the tissues examined, in me-tabolizing MTBE, ETBE, and TAME.

In Aquincola tertiaricarbonis L 108, Methylibium petroleiphilum PM 1, and Methylibium sp. strain R 8, we have now detected volatile hydrocarbons as by-products of the degradation of the tert-alkyl ether metabolites tert-butyl and tert-amyl alcohol (TBA and TAA, respectively). The alkene isobutene was formed only during TBA catabolism, while the beta and gamma isomers of isoamylene were produced only during TAA conversion. Both tert-alkyl alcohol degradation and alkene production were strictly oxygen dependent. However, the relative contribution of the dehydration reaction to total alcohol conversion increased with decreasing oxygen concentrations. In resting-cell experiments where the headspace oxygen content was adjusted to less than 2 %, more than 50 % of the TAA was converted to isoamylene. Isobutene formation from TBA was about 20 -fold lower, reaching up to 4 % alcohol turnover at low oxygen concentrations. It is likely that the putative tert-alkyl alcohol monooxygenase MdpJ, belonging to the Rieske nonheme mononuclear iron enzymes and found in all three strains tested, or an associated enzymatic step catalyzed the unusual elimination reaction. This was also supported by the detection of mdpJK genes in MTBE-degrading and isobutene-emitting enrichment cultures obtained from two treatment ponds operating at Leuna, Germany.

Despite being considered as ‘problematic’, p-cymene has no red shaded scores, and as a renewable hydrocarbon is well placed to substitute toluene and other aromatic solvents [79 – 84]. Cyclic carbonates [70, 85], and Cyrene [69], suffer in the environmental assessment because of their high boiling points, but offer clear health advantages over classical dipolar aprotic solvents (Fig.  13).

Strains IFP 2001, IFP 2005 and IFP 2009 grew on ETBE {{due in part}} to the activity of a cytochrome P 450, CYP 249. All of these strains were able to degrade ETBE to tert-butyl alcohol and are harboring the CYP 249 cytochrome P 450.

40|$|The alkane hydroxylase enzyme {{system in}} Pseudomonas putida GPo 1 has {{previously}} {{been reported to be}} unreactive toward the gasoline oxygenate methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). We have reexamined this finding by using cells of strain GPo 1 grown in rich medium containing dicyclopropylketone (DCPK), a potent gratuitous inducer of alkane hydroxylase activity. Cells grown with DCPK oxidized MTBE and generated stoichiometric quantities of tert-butyl alcohol (TBA). Cells grown in the presence of DCPK also oxidized <b>tert-amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> but did not appear to oxidize either TBA, ethyl tert-butyl <b>ether,</b> or <b>tert-amyl</b> alcohol. Evidence linking MTBE oxidation to alkane hydroxylase activity was obtained through several approaches. First, no TBA production from MTBE was observed with cells of strain GPo 1 grown on rich medium without DCPK. Second, no TBA production from MTBE was observed in DCPK-treated cells of P. putida GPo 12, a strain that lacks the alkane-hydroxylase-encoding OCT plasmid. Third, all n-alkanes that support the growth of strain GPo 1 inhibited MTBE oxidation by DCPK-treated cells. Fourth, two non-growth-supporting n-alkanes (propane and n-butane) inhibited MTBE oxidation in a saturable, concentration-dependent process. Fifth, 1, 7 -octadiyne, a putative mechanism-based inactivator of alkane hydroxylase, fully inhibited TBA production from MTBE. Sixth, MTBE-oxidizing activity was also observed in n-octane-grown cells. Kinetic studies with strain GPo 1 grown on n-octane or rich medium with DCPK suggest that MTBE-oxidizing activity may have previously gone undetected in n-octane-grown cells because of the unusually high Ks value (20 to 40 mM) for MTBE...|$|R

Both a laboratory strain and natural isolates were able to degrade each compound after growth on propane. When propane-grown strain ENV 425 was incubated with 20 mg of uniformly labeled [14 C]MTBE per liter, the strain converted > 60 % of the added MTBE to 14 CO 2 in < 30 h. The initial oxidation of MTBE and ETBE resulted in the production of nearly stoichiometric amounts of tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), while the initial oxidation of TAME resulted in the production of tert-amyl alcohol. The methoxy methyl group of MTBE was oxidized to formaldehyde and ultimately to CO 2. TBA was further oxidized to 2 -methyl- 2 -hydroxy- 1 -propanol and then 2 -hydroxy isobutyric acid; however, neither of these degradation products was an effective growth substrate for the propane oxidizers. Analysis of cell extracts of ENV 425 and experiments with enzyme inhibitors implicated a soluble P- 450 enzyme in the oxidation of both MTBE and TBA. MTBE was oxidized to TBA by camphor-grown Pseudomonas putida CAM, which produces the well-characterized P- 450 cam, but not by Rhodococcus rhodochrous 116, which produces two P- 450 enzymes.

We demonstrated that the cytochrome involved in EPTC biodegradation was also able to degrade ETBE to tert-butyl alcohol (TBA).

The overall arithmetic mean concentrations in the integrated samples (n = 8) were 0. 90 mg/m 3 for benzene and 0. 56 mg/m 3 for C 6 AMEs calculated as a group. Mean MTBE concentrations in ambient air (a stationary point {{in the middle of}} the pump island) were 0. 16 mg/m 3 for station A and 0. 07 mg/m 3 for station B. The mean ambient concentrations of TAME, C 6 AMEs, and benzene were 0. 031 mg/m 3, approximately 0. 005 mg/m 3, and approximately 0. 01 mg/m 3, respectively, at both stations. The mean wind speed was 1. 4 m/sec and mean air temperature was 21 degreesC.

By blending ethers into the gasoline pool, less ground-level ozone is formed and combustion of the gasoline is more efficient {{as a result of}} the oxygen boost. The main goal of this research was to study the synthesis of TAME (<b>tert-amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether,</b> 2 -methoxy- 2 -methylbutane) and to formulate a kinetic model as precise as possible for process design purposes. The reaction rate was studied as a function of temperature and the reagents feed molar ratio with conventional ion-exchange resin beads and a novel fibrous ion-exchange catalyst. Kinetic modelling favoured the Langmuir-Hinshelwood type model, derived from a dual-site mechanism for the etherification. The influence of the acid capacity of the catalysts on the reaction rate was found to be second order. These results suggest that the etherification reactions occur via a dual-site mechanism. Comparison of the values of the kinetic parameters obtained with a fibre catalyst and with a bead catalyst indicated that diffusion limitations are associated with the latter. Therefore, mass transfer of the reacting components inside the pores of the cationic ion-exchange resin bead was estimated in terms of the effectiveness factors calculated from experiments with different resin bead sizes. It was concluded that mass transfer has to be taken into account when applying the kinetic model, which was derived for resin beads as the catalyst. High temperatures and high alcohol concentrations favoured the formation of the dialkyl ethers (dehydration) as a side reaction. When the reaction was maintained in a kinetic regime, it was highly selective for tert-etherification, since the rate of tert-etherification was 140 to 270 times that of dehydration. The experimental results were best described with a model in which one alcohol molecule is adsorbed and the other reacts from the liquid phase. The activation energy was determined to be 102. 6  kJ/mol for methanol dehydration to yield DME. The ranges of validity of the other complete kinetic models proposed for the synthesis of TAME in the literature were evaluated by simulating the experimental conditions and by comparing the adequacy of the models in predicting the experimental composition changes and the composition at reaction equilibrium. Activity-based models were found to predict our experimental results better under a wider range of conditions than concentration-based models. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{tertiary}} alkyl ethers as gasoline components {{has been}} gaining relevance in the last decades because they can enhance the gasoline octane rating {{at the time that}} they reduce the environmental impact of combustion processes, being therefore considered as environmentally friendly additives. Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) are the most produced ethers at industrial scale. More recently, ETBE market is acquiring a predominant role compared to MTBE, due to environmental concerns associated with MTBE usage and because ETBE can be manufactured from bioethanol, what confers a bioether character. Apart from MTBE and ETBE, other <b>ethers</b> as <b>tert-amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> (TAME) and <b>tert-amyl</b> ethyl <b>ether</b> (TAEE) are interesting alternatives since they can be manufactured from C 5 reactive olefins present in gasoline that present drawbacks as high blending vapor pressure or high potential of tropospheric ozone formation. Similar to ETBE, TAEE can be considered as a bioether since bioethanol can be used as reactant. In this sense, ETBE and TAEE can be envisaged as the most promising alternatives as gasoline additives to fulfill the progressively stricter legislation while being compatible with current engines and therefore, a plausible solution at medium-short term. The optimization and integration of chemical processes is an incentive for industrial plants since several benefits can be obtained as savings in operating and maintenance costs. The simultaneous production of several ethers in the same reaction unit can be a clear example of such technology. A simultaneous etherification unit yielding a mixture of ETBE and TAEE {{would be one of the}} most interesting configurations. To the best to our knowledge, such a process has not been yet studied at bench scale. The present PhD thesis is focused on the study of the feasibility of producing ETBE and TAEE as one pot synthesis in the same reaction unit since the industrial interest of such ethers implies a realistic possibility of implementation in the near future. The main topics covered and assessed throughout the present manuscript are: the comparison of different chemical pathways to evaluate the process feasibility, the optimization of experimental conditions that maximize etherification yields, the study of the effect of water presence on the ethanol used as reactant, the characterization of potential byproducts and how to avoid side reactions, the study of the chemical equilibrium and the implicit thermodynamics of involved reactions, the assessment of several catalysts in order to find the best catalyst and the catalytic properties influencing the observed catalytic activity, the study of the intrinsic kinetics of the main reactions involved in order to find a reliable kinetic model, the study of the adsorption equilibrium of involved species in a potential catalytic surface and finally, the study of the catalyst deactivation process caused by the presence of acetonitrile in the feed stream. As for the main results, the optimum chemical pathway for producing ETBE and TAEE has been found. Reactants equilibrium conversions and selectivity have been obtained over a wide range of experimental conditions and etherification yields have been empirically modeled and optimized to obtain the experimental conditions that maximize them. Equilibrium constants and thermodynamic state functions of main reactions involved have been experimentally determined, resulting that main etherification reactions are all of exothermic nature. Amberlsyt™ 35 has been obtained as the best catalyst among evaluated ones. The relation between acid capacity and volume of swollen polymer have been found as the catalyst properties with more influence on the observed catalytic activity. Reliable kinetic models including activation energies and adsorption parameters have been obtained for the main reactions. An Eley-Rideal mechanism has been deduced as the most probable for the reaction system studied. Adsorption equilibrium constants of species on Amberlsyt™ 35 have been determined in liquid and gas phase. Adsorption of olefins and ethers are comparable and notably lower than that of alcohols. Also diffusivities of species have been estimated. Finally, the catalyst poisoning is enhanced by the concentration of acetonitrile and temperature and a first order kinetic law has been found to describe better the deactivation process. El uso de éteres terciarios como aditivos para las gasolinas ha estado ganando relevancia en las últimas décadas ya que además de aumentar el número de octano de la mezcla, reducen el impacto medioambiental generado por la quema del combustible. La optimización e integración de procesos químicos es un incentivo para muchas plantas industriales ya que se pueden obtener cuantiosos beneficios en los costes de operación y mantenimiento. La producción simultanea de varios éteres terciarios en la misma unidad podría considerarse un ejemplo claro de esta tecnología. Una unidad de eterificación simultanea de isobuteno e isoamilenos con etanol para producir una mezcla de etil terc-butil éter (ETBE) y terc-amil etil éter (TAEE) es una configuración industrial muy interesante y que hasta el momento no se ha planteado ni estudiado a escala de laboratorio. La presente tesis doctoral se basa en el estudio de la viabilidad de la producción simultánea de ETBE y TAEE en la misma unidad de reacción ya que el interés industrial y medioambiental la hace una alternativa plausible y realista que podría ser una realidad industrial a corto medio plazo. Los principales temas abordados en la tesis son: la comparación de diferentes rutas químicas con el objetivo de elucidar la ruta más verde desde un punto de vista medioambiental; la optimización de las condiciones experimentales que permiten maximizar el rendimiento a éteres; el estudio del efecto de agua como potencial impureza del etanol a usar como reactante; el estudio de las constantes de equilibrio y propiedades termodinámicas de las reacciones implicadas; la evaluación de varios tipos de catalizadores con el objetivo de encontrar un catalizador potencial para el proceso e indagar en las propiedades morfológicas que más influencia presentan sobre la actividad catalítica observada; un estudio cinético exhaustivo con el fin de elucidar información importante sobre la cinética del proceso y los posibles mecanismos de reacción implicados en el mismo; el estudio de la adsorción de las especies implicadas sobre un catalizador potencial con el fin de evaluar las constantes de equilibrio y propiedades de adsorción termodinámicas de los diferentes compuestos químicos; y finalmente, el estudio de la desactivación del catalizador por la presencia de posibles venenos en las corrientes de alimento de reactantes...|$|R
40|$|Gasoline oxygenates (MTBE, methyl tert-butyl ether; DIPE, di-isopropyl ether; ETBE, ethyl tert-butyl ether; TAME, <b>tert-amyl</b> <b>ether)</b> {{are added}} to {{gasoline}} to boost octane and enhance combustion. The combination of large scale use, high water solubility and only minor biodegradability has now resulted in a significant gasoline oxygenate contamination occurring in surface, ground, and drinking water systems. Combination of hydroxyl radical formation and the pyrolytic environment generated by ultrasonic irradiation (665 kHz) leads to the rapid degradation of MTBE and other gasoline oxygenates in aqueous media. ^ The presence of oxygen promotes the degradation processes by rapid reaction with carbon centered radicals indicating radical processes involving O 2 are significant pathways. A number of the oxidation products were identified. The formation of products (alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters, peroxides, etc) could be rationalized by mechanisms which involve hydrogen abstraction by OH radical and/or pyrolysis to form carboncentered radicals which react with oxygen and follow standard oxidation chain processes. ^ The reactions of N-substituted R-triazolinediones (RTAD; R = CH 3 or phenyl) have attracted considerable interest because they exhibit a number of unusual mechanistic characteristics that are analogous to the reactions of singlet oxygen (1 O 2) and offer {{an easy way to}} provide C-N bond(s) formation. The reactions of triazolinedione with olefins have been widely studied and aziridinium imides are generally accepted to be the reactive intermediates. ^ We observed the rapid formation of an unusual intermediate upon mixing tetracyclopropylethylene with 4 -methyl- 1, 2, 4 -triazoline- 3, 5 -dione in CDCl 3. Detailed characterization by NMR (proton, 13 C, 2 -D NMRs) indicates the intermediate is 5, 5, 6, 6 -tetracyclopropyl- 3 -methyl- 5, 6 -dihydro-oxazolo[3, 2 - b][1, 2, 4]-triazolium- 2 -olate. Such products are extremely rare and have not been studied. Upon warming the intermediate is converted to 2 + 2 diazetidine (major) and ene product (minor). ^ To further explore the kinetics and dynamics of the reaction activation energies were obtained using Arrhenius plots. Activation energies for the formation of the intermediate from reactants, and 2 + 2 adduct from the intermediate were determined as 7. 48 kcal moll and 19. 8 kcal mol− 1 with their pre-exponential values of 2. 24 × 105 dm 3 mol− 1 sec− 1 and 2. 75 × 108 sec− 1, respectively, meaning net slow reactions because of low pre-exponential values caused by steric hindrance. ...|$|R

Isothermal experimental runs were carried out in a stirred tank batch reactor in the temperature range 323 - 353 K at 2. 0 MPa, starting from different initial concentrations.

40|$|The {{switch to}} {{unleaded}} fuels in the 1970 s {{and the high}} air pollution in areas of high population density due to traffic particularly since the 1990 s required the use of alternative fuel additives to achieve an improvement of the combustion. The utilization of oxygenated hydrocarbons as antiknock additives and so-called oxygenates provided a more complete and efficient combustion with simultaneously less harmful and polluting emissions. These include the synthetic ethers methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert-butyl <b>ether</b> (ETBE), <b>tert-amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> (TAME) and <b>tert-amyl</b> ethyl <b>ether</b> (TAEE). MTBE has a particular position as within some years it became the dominant oxygenate worldwide. Since then, over 100. 000 leakages, most often {{in close proximity to}} gas stations, resulted in just as many oxygenate-contaminated sites of soil and groundwater within few years. The high water solubility of these ethers leads to an especially fast and extensive spread of the contamination plumes. Ether-contaminated groundwater has a turpentine-like taste that is noticed already in really low concentrations. Thus, such water can no longer serve as drinking water and requires a counter-measure. The chemical parameters of oxygenates decrease the efficiency of otherwise successfully applied techniques such as adsorption or aeration. In addition the ethers proved recalcitrant against microbial attack. The search for microorganisms that could degrade these synthetic oxygenates indeed resulted in the enrichment of many isolates. The majority of these isolates oxidize the ethers in a cometabolic manner either partially or completely to CO 2. However, only few cultures are capable of independent growth on these oxygenates. These include the beta-proteobacteria Methylibium petroleiphilum PM 1 and Aquincola tertiaricarbonis L 108, of which the latter is of particular interest for the present work. Strain L 108 is characterized by good growth on MTBE and is presently the only known isolate which is able to mineralize ETBE, TAME and TAEE at similar rates. This work examined the seemingly particularly well adapted oxygenate ether metabolism of strain L 108, that was formerly isolated from an aquifer highly contaminated with MTBE. Via diverse deletion studies key enzymes of the degradative metabolism and their genetic background were clearly identified. Hence, the results of this work contribute to verify so far just hypothesized metabolic steps by detailed enzymatic and genetic studies. Based on detected metabolites, first studies on MTBE biodegradation already postulated an oxidative pathway via TBA, 2 -methyl- 1, 2 -propane-diol (MPD) and 2 -HIBA. In case of a monoxygenatic hydroxylation of the methoxy group of MTBE a hemiacetale results as reaction product, from which the tertiary alcohol TBA can be formed easily in subsequent reactions. By comparing wild type strain L 108 with the spontaneous mutant strain L 10, we were now able to clearly show that the cytochrome P- 450 monoxygenase system EthABCD accounts solely for this MTBE-oxidizing activity. It is also the only enzyme catalyzing the corresponding hydroxylation of ETBE, TAME and TAEE. In strain L 108 this enzyme complex is expressed constitutively. TBA, which is also generated from hydroxylation of ETBE, is, as postulated and verified by this study, degraded by a different monoxygenase resulting in MPD. Via Tn 5 -mediated mutations this enzyme was confirmed as Rieske non-heme mononuclear iron monooxygenase MdpJ. MPD is further altered to the corresponding branched acid 2 -HIBA, presumably by two dehydrogenation reactions. For the degradation of 2 -HIBA, diverse hypotheses exist on the basis of known enzymatic reactions. Another Tn 5 mutation now gave evidence, that in the mentioned beta-proteobacteria the novel mutase HcmAB linearizes 2 -HIBA to 3 -hydroxybutyric acid (3 -HB) dependent on cobalamin and coenzyme A (CoA). Sequence comparison revealed, that strain L 108 acquired all three key enzyme complexes, EthABCD, MdpJ and HcmAB via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). For TAME and TAEE a completely new degradation pathway was found. In strain L 108, the resulting degradation product tert-amyl alcohol (TAA) of these ethers is, like TBA, also specifically oxidized by MdpJ. In Tn 5 -deletion studies and metabolite analyzes, however, no hydroxylation could be detected. Instead, TAA is rather desaturated. Therefore within the metabolism no diols or acids analogue to MPD or 2 -HIBA were formed. Instead, via MdpJ TAA is initially degraded to the unsaturated tertiary alcohol and hemiterpene 2 -methyl- 3 -butene- 2 -ol. Prenol (3 -methyl- 2 -buten- 2 -ol), prenal (3 -methyl- 2 -buten- 2 -al) and 3 -methyl crotonic acid were detected as additional metabolites. Hence, an isomerization of the branched acid by HcmAB is apparently irrelevant in TAA biodegradation. Accordingly it could be shown, that deletion mutants for HcmAB indeed could not grow on TBA, but are still able to grow on TAA, just as fast as the wild type, in fact. The tertiary alcohol 2 -methyl- 3 -butene- 2 -ol is presumably transformed via another isomerase resulting in the primary alcohol prenol. Prenol is further oxidized by postulated dehydrogenases to 3 -methyl crotonic acid. This would also be in correlation to the already observed degradation pathway of the monoterpene linalool in other bacteria. However, the responsible enzymes in strain L 108 are not yet identified. Besides this principal gain of knowledge in the degradation of xenobiotic ether structures and the evolution of degradative microorganism, the now confirmed key enzymes EthB, MdpJ and HcmAB, respectively their coding genes, can be used as specific markers to monitor natural degradation processes in in situ studies. On this basis, the presence of active microorganisms and additionally - derived from the confirmed single key enzymes - a potentially complete degradation can be concluded. In the long run, {{it might be possible to}} stimulate the natural microbiological activity, e. g. via bioaugmentation with degradation specialists. Furthermore, regarding the potential progress of remediation procedures, potentially limiting steps can be distinguished via respective markers and narrowed down as possible cause of deficient degradation activity. However, such function-based monitoring requires specific verification. Therefore, subsequent studies have to analyze, if there is a sequence diversity among these three key enzymes. Previous sequence comparisons hypothesize that up to 60 % accordance in the protein sequence in homologues of MdpJ and HcmA they can still be assumed to possess the same enzymatic function. This diversity has to be considered in the development of specific probes. Die Einführung bleifreien Benzins in den 1970 er-Jahren und die hohe Emissionsbelastung von Ballungszentren durch den Straßenverkehr insbesondere seit den 1990 er-Jahren erforderte den Einsatz alternativer Benzinadditive, um eine Verbesserung der Verbrennung zu erreichen. Die Nutzung sauerstoffhaltiger Kohlenwasserstoffe als Antiklopfmittel und als sogenannte Oxygenate bot sich an, da diese eine effizientere Verbrennung mit gleichzeitig niedrigeren gesundheits- und umweltschädigenden Emissionen fördern. Zu den Oxygenaten gehören die synthetischen Ether Methyl-tert-butylether (MTBE), Ethyl-tert-butylether (ETBE), tert-Amylmethylether (TAME) und tert-Amylethylether (TAEE). Eine herausragende Stellung nimmt MTBE ein. Innerhalb weniger Jahre wurde es zum hauptsächlich verwendeten Oxygenat weltweit. Seitdem führten jedoch über 100. 000 Leckagen, zumeist in Tankstellennähe, innerhalb weniger Jahre zu ebenso zahlreichen Kontaminationen des Grundwassers mit Oxygenaten. Aufgrund der hohen Wasserlöslichkeit kommt es dabei zu einer besonders schnellen und großflächigen Ausbreitung der Ether. Derart belastetes Grundwasser weist schon bei geringsten Etherkonzentrationen einen als terpentinartig wahrgenommenen Geruch und Geschmack auf und kann daher nicht mehr als Trinkwasserzufuhr genutzt werden. Es bedarf einer Lösung dieses Problems. Die chemischen Parameter der Ether senken allerdings die Effizienz anderweitig erfolgreich genutzter technischer Sanierungsverfahren auf Basis von z. B. Adsorption oder Aerisierung. Auch gegenüber mikrobiellen Abbau erweisen sie sich als rekalzitrant. Die Suche nach oxygenatabbauenden Mikroorganismen führte zwar zur Anreicherung vieler Isolate, welche die Oxygenate cometabolisch partiell oder sogar komplett oxidieren, nur sehr wenige Kulturen sind aber zu autarkem Wachstum auf diesen Ethern fähig. Dazu gehören die Beta-Proteobacteria Methylibium petroleiphilum PM 1 und der dieser Arbeit zugrunde liegende Aquincola tertiaricarbonis L 108. Der Stamm L 108 zeichnet sich durch ein vergleichsweise gutes Wachstum auf MTBE aus und ist als bisher einzig bekanntes Isolat in der Lage, auch ETBE, TAME und TAEE ähnlich schnell zu mineralisieren. Die vorliegende Arbeit handelt von dem scheinbar besonders gut an den Oxygenatabbau adaptierten Stoffwechsel des ursprünglich aus MTBE-kontaminiertem Grundwasser angereicherten Stammes L 108. Durch verschiedene Deletionsstudien wurden Schlüsselenzyme des Abbaus und deren genetischer Hintergrund eindeutig identifiziert. Die Ergebnisse der genetischen, enzymatischen und physiologischen Studien des Wildtyps im Vergleich zu den erzeugten Deletionsstämmen tragen dazu bei, bisher nur postulierte Reaktionsschritte zu verifizieren. Schon seit den ersten Studien zum MTBE-Abbau wird anhand markanter Metabolite ein oxidativer Abbau via TBA, 2 -Methyl- 1, 2 -propandiol (MPD) und 2 -Hydroxyisobuttersäure (2 -HIBA) vermutet. Im Fall einer Hydroxylierung der Methoxygruppe von MTBE wird ein Hemiacetal als Reaktionsprodukt erzeugt, aus dem nachfolgend leicht der tertiäre Alkohol TBA entstehen kann. Durch den Vergleich des Wildtyps mit der Spontanmutante Stamm L 10 konnte jetzt gezeigt werden, dass hierfür allein das Cytochrom-P 450 -Monooxygenasesystem EthABCD verantwortlich ist. Dieses katalysiert auch exklusiv die entsprechende Hydroxylierung von ETBE, TAME und TAEE. In Stamm L 108 wird das Enzym konstitutiv exprimiert. TBA, das auch aus der Hydroxylierung von ETBE resultiert, wird, wie postuliert und in dieser Arbeit verifiziert, durch eine weitere Monooxygenase zu MPD abgebaut. Durch eine Tn 5 -Transposon-vermittelte Mutation konnte verifiziert werden, dass es sich bei diesem Enzym um die Rieske-nicht-Häm-Monooxygenase MdpJ handelt. MPD wird im weiteren Verlauf voraussichtlich durch zwei Dehydrogenierungen zur korrespondierenden, verzweigten Säure 2 -HIBA gewandelt. Zum 2 -HIBA-Abbau gibt es, basierend auf bekannten Enzymreaktionen, diverse Hypothesen. Anhand einer weiteren Tn 5 -Mutation konnte jetzt bestätigt werden, dass in den genannten beta-Proteobacteria die neuartige Mutase HcmAB wirksam ist, welche 2 -HIBA abhängig von Cobalamin und Coenzym A (CoA) zu 3 -Hydroxybuttersäure (3 -HB) linearisiert. Sequenzvergleiche ergaben, dass Stamm L 108 die Schlüsselenzyme des Etherabbaus, EthABCD, MdpJ und HcmAB, durch horizontalen Gentransfer erworben hat. Für TAME und TAEE wurde ein völlig neuer Abbauweg gefunden. In Stamm L 108 wird der beim Abbau dieser Ether entstehende tert-Amylalkohol (TAA) wie TBA ebenfalls exklusiv durch MdpJ oxidiert. Durch die Tn 5 -Deletionsstudien und durch Analyse der Metabolite konnte allerdings keine Hydroxylierung nachgewiesen werden. TAA wird durch MdpJ vielmehr desaturiert. Somit entstehen im Abbauweg keine zu MPD und 2 -HIBA analogen Diole und Säuren, sondern TAA wird zunächst durch MdpJ zu einem ungesättigten tertiären Alkohol, dem Hemiterpen 2 -Methyl- 3 -buten- 2 -ol, abgebaut. Prenol (3 -Methyl- 2 -buten- 2 -ol), Prenal (3 -Methyl- 2 -buten- 2 -al) und 3 -Methylcrotonsäure wurden als weitere Metabolite des TAA-Stoffwechsels detektiert. Somit spielt eine Isomerisierung einer tertiär verzweigten Säure durch HcmAB im TAA-Abbauweg offensichtlich keine Rolle. Entsprechend konnte gezeigt werden, dass Deletionsmutanten für hcmAB zwar nicht mehr auf TBA, aber immer noch auf TAA wachsen können, und das genauso schnell, wie der Wildtyp. Der tertiäre Alkohol 2 -Methyl- 3 -buten- 2 -ol wird wahrscheinlich durch eine andere Isomerase zum primären Alkohol Prenol umgewandelt und dieser dann durch Dehydrogenasen zur Methylcrotonsäure oxidiert. Dies würde dem bereits in anderen Bakterien beobachteten Abbauweg des Monoterpens Linalool entsprechen. Die in Stamm L 108 dafür verantwortlichen Enzyme wurden aber noch nicht identifiziert. Neben diesem grundsätzlichen Erkenntnisgewinn zum Abbau der xenobiotischen Etherverbindungen und der Evolution degradativer Mikroorganismen, können die hier bestätigten Schlüssel-enzyme EthABCD, MdpJ und HcmAB bzw. deren codierende Gene als spezifische Marker zum Monitoring natürlicher Abbauprozesse für in-situ-Untersuchungen genutzt werden. Auf dieser Basis kann auf die Anwesenheit aktiver Mikroorganismen und zudem noch - abgeleitet aus der Präsenz der einzelnen Schlüsselenzyme - auf einen potenziell kompletten Abbau geschlossen werden. Darauf aufbauend kann die natürliche mikrobiologische Aktivität durch nachfolgende biotechnologische Maßnahmen stimuliert werden, zum Beispiel durch eine Bioaugmentation mit Abbauspezialisten. Des weiteren können mögliche limitierende Schritte hinsichtlich des potenziellen Verlaufs der Sanierungsmaßnahme über Präsenztiter der betreffenden Marker gezielter verfolgt und als etwaige Ursachen defizitärer Abbauleistungen eingegrenzt werden. Voraussetzung für dieses funktionsbasierte Monitoring ist allerdings der spezifische Nachweis. Somit sollte in nachfolgenden Studien analysiert werden, ob es bei den drei Schlüsselenzymen eine Sequenzdiversität gibt. Die bisherigen Sequenzvergleiche lassen zumindest vermuten, dass bis etwa 60 % Übereinstimmung der Proteinsequenzen bei Homologen von MdpJ und HcmA noch mit der gleichen Enzymfunktion zu rechnen ist. Diese Diversität sollte bei der Entwicklung von spezifischen Sonden berücksichtigt werden...|$|R
