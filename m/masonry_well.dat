50|$|The line 3 {{platforms}} {{opened on}} 19 October 1904 {{as part of}} the first section of the line opened between Père Lachaise and Villiers. A twenty metre high <b>masonry</b> <b>well</b> was built to avoid the need for heavy underpinning work when lines 7 and 8 were planned to be built. This work was affected by groundwater, which required the support of three concrete pillars, made by sinking caissons with workers digging out the mud with compressed air. The work lasted eleven months, from March 1903 to February 1904. The line 7 platforms opened on 5 November 1910 {{as part of the}} first section of the line opened between Opéra and Porte de la Villette. The line 8 platforms opened on 13 July 1913 as part of the first section of the line opened between Opéra and Beaugrenelle (now Charles Michels station on line 10).|$|E
50|$|The eight sets of gates are {{connected}} {{by means of}} chains and pulleys to a dead weight, {{which in turn is}} connected to a float, making up the 'balance weight' together, working inside a <b>masonry</b> <b>well,</b> both situated on the rear of the dam. The dead weight and float are placed one behind the other so as to have four gates on each side of it. When all the eight gates close the sluice, the balance weight moves to the top of its swing and the float {{to the bottom of the}} well. The well has an inlet pipe of abbr=on 1 ft diameter from the reservoir that allows water in when the reservoir reaches maximum permissible level causing the float to rise, the balance weight to fall pulling the gates up allowing discharge of water. In the same mechanism, the well gets emptied through an exit pipe when water level in the reservoir falls.|$|E
30|$|As {{the initial}} {{phase of the}} {{research}} project, {{a review of the}} technical literature on experimental research on the deformation capacity of structural masonry was conducted. The main objective of the literature review was to provide a comprehensive database of available test results for statistical analysis of the deformation capacity of structural <b>masonry</b> as <b>well</b> as for identifying the decisive parameters for our own experimental work.|$|R

50|$|Laurence Dermott had a strong, pugnacious {{presence}} {{that made him}} many enemies.

50|$|Excavation of the {{basilica}} revealed {{that it was}} most likely constructed using tufa blocks, as was common in buildings of the time. Weak areas in the building may have been reinforced with travertine blocks, and the entire facade would most likely have been covered in stucco to hide the <b>masonry</b> as <b>well</b> as decorate it. The roof would have resembled those of temples {{and would have been}} made of wooden trusses and beams. The exterior of the roof would have been covered in tiles to protect the roof from the elements, and the interior would have been coffered to lessen the weight and finished in stucco.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Monuments are {{precious}} {{historical and}} cultural heritages, they are non-renewable cultural resources, the authenticity of monuments lies {{in the value of}} cultural relics, protecting the monument’s historical value and reflecting the complete history characteristics in particular historical period are the restoration principles of monuments. This paper proposed the attentions of applied chemicals in the restoration of monuments by introducing the application of chemicals in monument’s anti-corrosion treatment of wooden components, reinforcement of wooden components, protection of <b>masonry</b> as <b>well</b> as <b>masonry</b> reinforcement etc. Chemicals can effectively protect the unique historical, scientific and artistic value of monuments, chemicals and chemical technology will have broad application prospects in the field of monument restoration technology...|$|R

2500|$|The {{site was}} partly {{excavated}} {{by a team}} of Royal Navy officers under Capt. D. Scott and Sgn. Comdr. P. Pugh. [...] However, the exposed <b>masonry</b> as <b>well</b> as contemporary deposits had been almost completely eroded, making the interpretation of the archaeological remains very difficult. Work began in November 1961 and finished in May 1962, when a party of naval divers explored the seabed off the headland, reaching a depth of over 60metres. A few scattered stone blocks lying in the sand were noted. The report of this excavation is brief, with the published plan of the site being inaccurate. The team was of the opinion that the place [...] "was used as a sacred site from Neolithic times to about the 4th century AD." ...|$|R
