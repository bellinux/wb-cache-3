5000|$|The hogscraper {{candlestick}} is {{an early}} (circa 1780 - 1860) form of lighting device commonly used in 19th-century North America and Britain, and mainly manufactured in England. The device is manufactured of tempered sheet iron, wrought in several pieces and joined together by <b>metal</b> <b>joinery</b> and silver soldering. The name {{is derived from the}} candlestick's resemblance to an antique device used to scrape bristles from hog hide after slaughter. The antique lighting device commonly consists of a shaft, attached to a round base with a thumb tab ejector mechanism to remove the residual candle stub, and a round lip or [...] "bobeche" [...] to collect candle drippings. The [...] "bobeche" [...] often has a hook extension used for hanging the device. Some hogscraper candlesticks were manufactured with decorative brass or iron bands at the midsection of the shaft and are commonly referred to as [...] "wedding band" [...] hogscrapers. Often the devices are [...] "signed" [...] on the thumb ejector tab by the manufacturer. Historical trade directories have identified most of these manufacturers and the dates of their business existence. While most manufacturers have been identified to Birmingham there is evidence of manufacturing in Sheffield, England. There is no substantive evidence of American manufacturers before 1850.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} is substantially intact both internally and externally, with only minor alterations {{being made to}} the layout. It retains much of the pressed <b>metal</b> ceilings and <b>joinery.</b> Of the outbuildings, only one survives as the present garage, which was possibly the former laundry.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} has plastered masonry walls; {{high ceilings}} with decorative pressed <b>metal</b> panelling; well-detailed <b>joinery</b> (all now painted); and timber flooring (coated with a polyurethane finish). Many {{of the walls}} have been wallpapered (much appears to date from the 1960s or 1970s) and in some rooms paint has been applied over the wallpaper.|$|R
50|$|The former Mackay Technical College is {{significant}} as it displays the principal characteristics of an institutional building {{from the government}} architect's office of the period, with typical details such as its two storey masonry and timber construction and asymmetric design, with pressed <b>metal</b> ceilings, timber <b>joinery</b> and decorative ventilator fleche. The place demonstrates the principal characteristics of a building of its type, with provision for classrooms and lecture rooms, a library, a laboratory and office area.|$|R

50|$|The Charlotte Pound {{is located}} {{on the north side of}} Charlotte Road, about 0.25 mi east of its {{junction}} with Maine State Route 214. It is an octagonal structure, each side measuring about 18 ft. It has a cobbled stone foundation, and is constructed out of stacked cedar logs, the ends at each joint overhanging by about 1 ft, with half-round notches as <b>joinery.</b> <b>Metal</b> rods have been driven through each joint. Seven of the sides are seven logs in height, while the side facing south-southeast has eight. That side also has the entrance to the structure, in which the center six logs have been fastened via tenons to vertical posts, and a wooden gate mounted in the opening. The upper and lower logs of this side run over and under the gate.|$|R
50|$|Growing up, Businge recalls often {{carrying}} a 20-liter jerrycan on her head. Following her graduation {{from high school}} and the death of her sister and father, Businge enrolled at African Rural University. Realising she wanted to become an engineer, she transferred to the Uganda Rural Development Training Vocational Institute. She chose construction as her major, learning brick laying and concrete, mechanical engineering, carpentry, <b>joinery,</b> <b>metal</b> work and fabrication. She earned a scholarship from URDT, worked part-time in the metal workshop, and won a home design competition in 2009 for Uganda Vision 2035. She graduated from the program then attended St Joseph's Technical Institute in Kisubi, Uganda. In 2011 she set up two pico hydroelectric power stations in Kagadi. She earned a civil engineering degree in 2012, graduating {{at the top of her}} class and giving the commencement speech. Following her graduation she declined a job offer from the Ugandan Minister of Education, citing her intention to further her education.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} a development project carried out in Somalia in the early 1980 s, which was based on hydrogeological research. This research tested an original method and sound technology to locate and exploit groundwater resources. The project was implemented by the not-for-profit association Water For Life (founded in Trento in 1987) and recognized by both the Italian and Somali governments. The studies were made in the low Shabeelle River plain before the outbreak of the civil war and led to the important result that under the recent fluvial deposits, in which groundwater is frequently salty or brackish, there are ancient alluvial formations, constructed by a former river system. The reconstruction of the geological and geomorphological sequence in the area allowed us to assume that the groundwater of the ancient system was fresh. Three pilot wells that were drilled yielded freshwater, confirming the hypothesis. In 1992 the project was greatly enlarged to cope with the tragic situation in the agricultural district of the lower course of the Shabeelle River, which was created by civil war and exceptional drought. The field of the activities was extended from freshwater research to irrigation, to orphan assistance (about 1000 children), primary education (6500 – 7000 boys and girls), secondary education (an agricultural college with 200 students) and to vocational training (mechanics, <b>metal</b> work, <b>joinery,</b> masonry, women’s crafts, with a total of 180 apprentices). More recently, two new projects have started, which are supported financially by the European Union, the Italian Government and the Administration of Trento Province. Their aims are to train teachers and to help the communities to construct new school premises and furniture in all the villages. A well will be dug for every school. The location and depth of the wells will result from research carried out by installing piezometers. This methodology allows rapid testing for the presence, depth and salinity of groundwater. Where the test is unsuccessful, casing and pipes can be recovered and used for another piezometer...|$|R
