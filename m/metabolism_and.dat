5|$|Another {{mechanism}} involves {{effects on}} the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain {{that is responsible for}} effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to cytochrome oxidase with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding. This binding interferes with aerobic <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> efficient adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, causing anoxia, lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Benzoyl {{peroxide}} (BPO) is a first-line {{treatment for}} mild and moderate acne {{due to its}} effectiveness and mild side-effects (mainly skin irritation). In the skin follicle, benzoyl peroxide kills P. acnes by oxidizing its proteins through the formation of oxygen free radicals and benzoic acid. These free radicals are thought {{to interfere with the}} bacterium's <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> ability to make proteins. Additionally, benzoyl peroxide is mildly effective at breaking down comedones and inhibiting inflammation. Benzoyl peroxide may be paired with a topical antibiotic or retinoid such as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Contaminated {{breathing}} gas {{at depth}} can be fatal. Concentrations which are acceptable {{at the surface}} ambient pressure will be increased by the pressure of depth and may then exceed acceptable or tolerable limits. Common contaminants are: carbon monoxide - a by-product of combustion, carbon dioxide - a product of <b>metabolism,</b> <b>and</b> oil and lubricants from the compressor.|$|E

5|$|Extracts of {{the fruit}} body of Ramaria {{botrytis}} {{have been shown to}} favorably influence the growth and development of HeLa cells grown in tissue culture. The mushroom contains nicotianamine, an ACE inhibitor (angiotensin-converting enzyme). Nicotianamine is a metal-chelating compound essential in iron <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> utilization in plants. Several sterols have been isolated from the fruit bodies, 5α,6α-epoxy-3β-hydroxy-(22E)-ergosta-8(14),22-dien-7-one, ergosterol peroxide, cerevisterol, and 9α-hydroxycerevisterol, in addition to the previously unknown ceramide (2S,2R,3R,4E,8E)-N-2'-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-2-amino-9-methyl-4,8-heptade-cadiene-1,3-diol.|$|E
5|$|FH is {{classified}} as a type 2 familial dyslipidemia. There are five types of familial dyslipidemia (not including subtypes), and each are classified from both the altered lipid profile and by the genetic abnormality. For example, high LDL (often due to LDL receptor defect) is type 2. Others include defects in chylomicron metabolism, triglyceride <b>metabolism,</b> <b>and</b> metabolism of other cholesterol-containing particles, such as VLDL and IDL.|$|E
5|$|Formica polyctena, {{among other}} ant species, {{constructs}} nests that maintain a relatively constant interior temperature that {{aids in the}} development of larvae.

5|$|Glycerophospholipids, usually {{referred}} to as phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, {{as well as being}} involved in <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> cell signaling. Neural tissue (including the brain) contains relatively high amounts of glycerophospholipids, and alterations in their composition has been implicated in various neurological disorders. Glycerophospholipids may be subdivided into distinct classes, based {{on the nature of the}} polar headgroup at the sn-3 position of the glycerol backbone in eukaryotes and eubacteria, or the sn-1 position in the case of archaebacteria.|$|E
5|$|H2 is {{a product}} of some types of {{anaerobic}} <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> is produced by several microorganisms, usually via reactions catalyzed by iron- or nickel-containing enzymes called hydrogenases. These enzymes catalyze the reversible redox reaction between H2 and its component two protons and two electrons. Creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water. The natural cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called the hydrogen cycle.|$|E
5|$|In cold or inclement weather, several {{nightjar}} {{species can}} slow their <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> go into torpor, notably the common poorwill, which will maintain that state for weeks.

5|$|In {{the form}} {{trivalent}} chromium, Cr(III), or Cr3+, chromium {{was identified as}} an essential nutrient in the late 1950s and later accepted as a trace element for its roles in the action of insulin, a hormone critical to the <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> storage of carbohydrate, fat and protein.

5|$|Lithium {{isotopes}} fractionate substantially {{during a}} wide variety of natural processes, including mineral formation (chemical precipitation), <b>metabolism,</b> <b>and</b> ion exchange. Lithium ions substitute for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites in clay minerals, where 6Li is preferred to 7Li, resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration. The exotic 11Li is known to exhibit a nuclear halo. The process known as laser isotope separation can be used to separate lithium isotopes, in particular 7Li from 6Li.|$|E
5|$|Manganese is an {{important}} element for human health, essential for development, <b>metabolism,</b> <b>and</b> the antioxidant system. Nevertheless, excessive exposure or intake {{may lead to a}} condition known as manganism, a neurodegenerative disorder that causes dopaminergic neuronal death and symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease. The classes of enzymes that have manganese cofactors is large and includes oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, ligases, lectins, and integrins. The reverse transcriptases of many retroviruses (though not lentiviruses such as HIV) contain manganese. The best-known manganese-containing polypeptides may be arginase, the diphtheria toxin, and Mn-containing superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD).|$|E
