40|$|Contribution {{deals with}} {{procedures}} of CAD creating of active surfaces of dies in bulk forming. In order to design active surfaces, shapes of forging dies have been solid modelled applying their design features as defined <b>mould</b> <b>joint,</b> chamfers and radii. Two methods of CAD modelling of active surfaces {{are presented as}} mould cavity mode and assembly mode which {{is referred to as}} Merge-Cut Out. Both methods are presented consecutively and their advantages are being compared by ways of cavitiesâ€™ design and applied model tree, as well...|$|E
50|$|The stucco on both {{levels is}} ruled to {{resemble}} ashlar masonry. The lower veranda is ceiled with boards. The upper floor is also lined with boards. These differ being {{run on the}} rake, are narrow and contain a rib <b>mould</b> at each <b>joint.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{deviating}} hygric behaviour of mortar joints, {{based on a}} combination of hygric property measurements, numerical simulations, sharp-front analysis and microscopic imaging. Comparison of the hygric properties of <b>mould</b> and <b>joint</b> mortars reveals significant differences. Further analysis with numerical simulations indicates however that an interface resistance must be attributed to the brick-mortar bond plane, which is further corroborated by sharp-front analysis of free water uptake in masonry samples. While the deviating hygric behaviour of mortar joints previously has been ascribed to hygric property changes or interface resistances, the current study points out that both are at play, and it demonstrates the influence of the curing conditions on these phenomena. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} {{performed}} within IMI Spray <b>Mould,</b> an EPSRC <b>joint</b> funded programme, aimed at developing a manufacturing route for large aerospace composite forming tooling, based on metal spray technologies. Assesses the mechanical properties of Invar steel coatings, deposited using electric arc spraying, and correlates these properties to the spray parameters and processes used {{so as to}} offer coatings with characteristics appropriate to the tooling requirements. In particular, two processing methods, inert and air atomisation, and three arc spray gun configurations (air cap design) are evaluated. The mechanical properties of the coatings {{are found to be}} low compared to bulk Invar, regardless of the spray parameters and hardware used. Inert arc spraying affords more consistent coating characteristics but this comes with a compromised durability. The spray hardware is found to be more significant in determining the coating properties than the parameters employed...|$|R
