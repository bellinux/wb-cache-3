5|$|This is not {{the place}} to pass judgements, but perhaps I <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> as it seems to me, both the monks and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the {{importance}} of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.|$|E
5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I <b>may</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} statement, one <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{whenever}} the classical {{equations of motion}} are integrable (e.g. rectangular or circular billiard tables), then the quantum-mechanical version of the billiards is completely solvable. When the classical system is chaotic, then the quantum system is generally not exactly solvable, and presents numerous difficulties in its quantization and evaluation. The general study of chaotic quantum systems is known as quantum chaos.|$|E

25|$|The {{phenotypic}} {{effect of}} a particular gene is contingent on its environment, including the fellow genes constituting with it the total genome. A gene never has a fixed effect, so {{how is it possible}} to speak of a gene for long legs? It is because of the phenotypic differences between alleles. One <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> one allele, all other things being equal or varying within certain limits, causes greater legs than its alternative. This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection.|$|E
25|$|If, therefore, it {{is claimed}} that your race {{is doomed to}} {{economic}} inferiority, you may confidently look {{to the home of}} your ancestors and say, that you have set out to recover for the colored people the strength that was their own before they set foot on the shores of this continent. You <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> you go to work with bright hopes, and that you will not be discouraged by the slowness of your progress; for you have to recover not only what has been lost in transplanting the Negro race from its native soil to this continent, but you must reach higher levels than your ancestors ever had attained.|$|E
25|$|Spiritual, emotional, and {{mathematical}} intellectuality, too, {{is behind the}} family group of Archipenko. This group, in plaster, might have been made of dough. It represents a featureless, large, strong male—one gets the impression of strength from humps and lumps—an impression of a female, less vivid, and the vague knowledge that a child is mixed up in the general embrace. The faces are rather blocky, the whole group with arms intertwined—arms that end suddenly, no hands, might be the sketch of a sculpture to be. But when one gets an insight it is intensely more interesting. It is, eventually, clear that in portraying his idea of family love the sculptor has built his figures with pyramidal strength; they are grafted together with love and geometric design, their limbs are bracings, ties of strength, they represent, not individuals, but the structure itself of family life. Not family life as one sees it, but the unseen, the deep emotional unseen, and in making his group when the sculptor found himself verging upon the seen—that is, when he no longer felt the unseen—he stopped. Therefore the hands were not essential. And this expression {{is made in the}} simplest way. Some will hoot at it, but others will feel the respect that is due one who simplifies and expresses the deep things of life. You <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> such is literature in marble—well, it is the most modern sculpture.|$|E

500|$|Burnham, Ingram and Gooding {{reached the}} Shangani about 08:00, but quickly {{saw that the}} water had risen far too high for Forbes to provide any assistance. Realising the {{futility}} of turning back to Wilson without help, they decided to rejoin Forbes anyway, and to that end traversed the swollen river with considerable difficulty. They then rode to where the battle on the southern side was still going on. On reaching the main column shaken and out of breath, Burnham leapt from his horse and ran to Forbes: [...] "I think I <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> we are the sole survivors of that party," [...] he quietly confided, before loading his rifle and joining the skirmish.|$|E

We are going to discard entirely all ornament. We are going to build in reinforced concrete.

We are going to represent the DIA gone mad, and in order that I may go mad in good company I have got Holden to see that we do it properly." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{harm done}} by Formosa lies in this,— that the {{character}} is utterly false, false to human nature and false to London life. She is a wretch, abominable almost beyond conception, {{so as to be}} odious, if known, to the most odious. She is sharper as well as prostitute,—and is false to all with whom she comes in contact, to those whom she is supposed to love and to those who love her. Her peculiar profession is represented as causing her no personal remorse. And yet she is exhibited to us as a fine creature, a noble woman, one whom a man might be honoured by loving;—and at last she ends with a success! ... That which is vile and dirty, squalid and miserable,—that, of which we <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> were its horrors known such knowledge would deter more thoroughly than any ignorance,—is exhibited as a bright existence, full of danger indeed, but still open to all that is noble, and capable of final success.|$|E
500|$|In 1841, Léon Escudier {{wrote of}} a recital given by Chopin that year, [...] "One <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Chopin is {{the creator of}} a school of piano and a school of composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the {{sweetness}} with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace." [...] Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed {{that there was no}} set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique. In his Projet de méthode he wrote: [...] "Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm." [...] He further stated: [...] "One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [...] unlimited dexterity." [...] The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.|$|E
500|$|Soon afterwards, {{the patrol}} found {{the king and}} Wilson sent a message back to the laager {{requesting}} reinforcements. Forbes, however, was unwilling to set off across the river in the dark, so he sent only 20 more men, {{under the command of}} Henry Borrow, to reinforce Wilson's patrol. Forbes intended to send the main body of troops and artillery across the river the following morning; however, the main column was ambushed by Matabele warriors and delayed. Wilson's patrol too came under attack, but the Shangani River had swollen and there was now no possibility of retreat. In desperation, Wilson sent Burnham and two other men, Pearl [...] "Pete" [...] Ingram (a Montana cowboy) and William Gooding (an Australian), to cross the Shangani River, find Forbes, and bring reinforcements. In spite of a shower of bullets and spears, the three made it to Forbes, but the battle raging there was just as intense as the one they had left, and there was no hope of anyone reaching Wilson in time. As Burnham loaded his rifle to beat back the Matabele warriors, he quietly said to Forbes, [...] "I think I <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> we are the sole survivors of that party." [...] Wilson, Borrow, and their men were indeed surrounded by hundreds of Matabele warriors; escape was impossible, and all were killed.|$|E

500|$|Of Locke's major {{claims in}} the Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Some Thoughts Concerning Education, two played a {{defining}} role in eighteenth-century educational theory. The first is that education makes the man; as Locke writes {{at the opening of}} his treatise, [...] "I think I <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> of all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their education." [...] In making this claim, Locke was arguing against both the Augustinian view of man, which grounds its conception of humanity in original sin, and the Cartesian position, which holds that man innately knows basic logical propositions. In his Essay Locke posits an [...] "empty" [...] mind—a tabula rasa—that is [...] "filled" [...] by experience. In describing the mind in these terms, Locke was drawing on Plato's Theatetus, which suggests that the mind is like a [...] "wax tablet". Although Locke argued strenuously for the tabula rasa theory of mind, he nevertheless did believe in innate talents and interests. For example, he advises parents to watch their children carefully to discover their [...] "aptitudes," [...] and to nurture their children's own interests rather than force them to participate in activities which they dislike—"he, therefore, that is about children should well study their natures and aptitudes and see, by often trials, what turn they easily take and what becomes them, observe what their native stock is, how it may be improved, and what it is fit for." ...|$|E
