5|$|The {{heterotrophic}} bacterial <b>microbiota</b> and {{the ecology}} of photosynthetic bacteria of the Lake Burton have been studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters, the <b>microbiota</b> activity caused depletion of oxygen, separate water bodies of distinct chemistry got formed, the intervening chemical gradients have created niches for colonization by unique microbial communities and 68 bacteria were isolated.|$|E
5|$|MFGM {{bioactive}} protein components, including the glycoproteins lactadherin, MUC-1, and butyrophilin, {{have been shown}} in preclinical studies to affect immune response. These components influence the immune system by several mechanisms, including interference with microbe adhesion to intestinal epithelia, bacteriocidal action, support of beneficial <b>microbiota,</b> and modulation of {{other parts of the}} immune system.|$|E
5|$|The {{anatomical}} {{structure of the}} internal organs and tissues of the female reproductive tract provides a pathway for pathogens to ascend from the vagina to the pelvic cavity thorough the infundibulum. The disturbance of the naturally occurring vaginal <b>microbiota</b> associated with bacterial vaginosis {{increases the risk of}} PID.|$|E
5|$|A diatom floristic {{study of}} the lagoon {{revealed}} that it contains 41 species and is a rich storehouse of psychrophilic photosynthetic bacteria. The heterotrophic bacterial <b>microbiota</b> and the ecology of photosynthetic bacteria of the Lake Burton were studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters and that the environmental conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness during winter, and oxic and anoxic water status of the lake waters dictated the growth of bacterial phototrophs.|$|E
5|$|MFGM may {{be capable}} of {{modulating}} immune function in the gut through distinct but potentially complementary mechanisms. Glycosylated proteins (MUC-1, MUC-15, butyrophilin, and lactadherin) and glycosylated sphingolipids from MFGM may promote the development of healthy gut <b>microbiota</b> by favoring beneficial Bifidobacterium species. Another key to the immunomodulatory function of MFGM may be that its structure {{is similar to that}} of the intestinal cell membrane, allowing human milk glycans (including those on glycoproteins and glycolipids) to competitively inhibit the binding of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, even toxins) to host cells.|$|E
5|$|Metformin {{decreases}} {{high blood}} sugar, primarily by suppressing liver glucose production (hepatic gluconeogenesis). The average patient with {{type 2 diabetes}} has three times the normal rate of gluconeogenesis; metformin treatment reduces this by over one-third. The molecular mechanism of metformin is incompletely understood. Multiple potential mechanisms of action have been proposed, including; inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I), activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibition of glucagon-induced elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with reduced activation of protein kinase A (PKA), inhibition of mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, and an effect on gut <b>microbiota.</b>|$|E
5|$|Microbes are {{important}} in human culture and health in many ways, serving to ferment foods, treat sewage, produce fuel, enzymes and other bioactive compounds. They are essential tools in biology as model organisms, and have been put to use in biological warfare and bioterrorism. They are a vital component of fertile soils. In the human body microorganisms make up the human <b>microbiota</b> including the essential gut flora. They are the pathogens responsible for many infectious diseases, and as such are the target of hygiene measures.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{species of}} benthic foraminifera became extinct during the K–Pg {{extinction}} event, presumably because {{they depend on}} organic debris for nutrients, since the biomass in the ocean {{is thought to have}} decreased. As the marine <b>microbiota</b> recovered, however, it is thought that increased speciation of benthic foraminifera resulted from the increase in food sources. Phytoplankton recovery in the early Paleocene provided the food source to support large benthic foraminiferal assemblages, which are mainly detritus-feeding. Ultimate recovery of the benthic populations occurred over several stages lasting several hundred thousand years into the early Paleocene.|$|E
5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} viewed as extremophiles living in harsh environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, {{but they have}} since been found in {{a broad range of}} habitats, including soils, oceans, and marshlands. They are also part of the human <b>microbiota,</b> found in the colon, oral cavity, and skin. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton {{may be one of the}} most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in both the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle. No clear examples of archaeal pathogens or parasites are known, but they are often mutualists or commensals. One example is the methanogens that inhabit human and ruminant guts, where their vast numbers aid digestion. Methanogens are also used in biogas production and sewage treatment, and biotechnology exploits enzymes from extremophile archaea that can endure high temperatures and organic solvents.|$|E
25|$|Gut flora, gut <b>microbiota</b> or {{gastrointestinal}} <b>microbiota</b> is {{the complex}} community of microorganisms {{that live in}} the digestive tracts of humans and other animals, including insects. The gut metagenome is the aggregate of all the genomes of gut <b>microbiota.</b> The gut is one niche that human <b>microbiota</b> inhabit.|$|E
25|$|Like other metazoans, Drosophila is {{associated}} with various bacteria in its gut. The fly gut <b>microbiota</b> or microbiome {{seems to have a}} central influence on Drosophila fitness and life history characteristics. The <b>microbiota</b> in the gut of Drosophila represents an active current research field.|$|E
25|$|Having {{a female}} partner {{increases}} the risk of BV by 60%. The bacteria associated with BV have been isolated from male genitalia. BV <b>microbiota</b> has been found in the penis, coronal sulcus, and male urethra, in the male partners of infected females. Partners who have not been circumcised may act as a ‘reservoir’ increasing the likelihood of acquiring an infection after sexual intercourse. Another mode of transmission of the BV-associated <b>microbiota</b> is to a female sexual partner via skin-to-skin transfer. BV may be transmitted via the perineal enteric bacteria from the <b>microbiota</b> of the female and male genitalia.|$|E
25|$|Healthy vaginal <b>microbiota</b> {{consists}} of species which neither cause symptoms or infections, nor negatively affect pregnancy. It is dominated mainly by Lactobacillus species. BV {{is defined by}} the disequilibrium in the vaginal <b>microbiota,</b> with {{decline in the number of}} lactobacilli. While the infection involves a number of bacteria, it is believed that most infections start with Gardnerella vaginalis creating a biofilm, which allows other opportunistic bacteria to thrive.|$|E
25|$|Probiotics {{have been}} the subject of {{research}} to see whether the health claims made for them have any supporting evidence. Overall scientific demonstration of probiotic effects requires defining a healthy <b>microbiota</b> and interactions between <b>microbiota</b> and host, and the difficulty to characterize probiotic effectiveness in health and disease. Recent developments of high-throughput sequencing technology and the consequent progresses of metagenomics represent a new approach for the future of probiotics research.|$|E
25|$|In humans, S. aureus {{is part of}} {{the normal}} <b>microbiota</b> present in the upper {{respiratory}} tract, and on skin and in the gut mucosa.|$|E
25|$|The NIH has {{launched}} the Human Microbiome Project {{to characterize the}} human <b>microbiota</b> which includes that on the skin {{and the role of}} this microbiome in health and disease.|$|E
25|$|The mode of {{transmission}} {{is also an important}} aspect of the biology of beneficial microbial symbionts, such as coral-associated dinoflagellates or human <b>microbiota.</b> Organisms can form symbioses with microbes transmitted from their parents, from the environment or unrelated individuals, or both.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of human gut <b>microbiota</b> changes over time, when the diet changes, and as overall health changes. A systematic review from 2016 examined the preclinical and small human trials {{that have been}} conducted with certain commercially available strains of probiotic bacteria and identified those that had the most potential to be useful for certain central nervous system disorders.|$|E
25|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that alterations of gut <b>microbiota</b> (dysbiosis) {{are associated with}} the intestinal manifestations of IBS, but also with the psychiatric morbidity that coexists in up to 80% of patients with IBS. The role of the gut mycobiota, and especially of the abnormal proliferation of the yeast Candida albicans in some patients with IBS, is under investigation.|$|E
25|$|Metabolic {{syndrome}} {{is a risk}} factor for neurological disorders. Metabolomic studies suggest an excess of organic acids, impaired lipid oxidation byproducts, essential fatty acids and essential amino acids in the blood serum of affected patients. However, it is not entirely clear whether the accumulation of essential fatty acids and amino acids is the result of excessive ingestion or excess production by gut <b>microbiota.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat), certain Streptococcus species {{are responsible for}} many cases of pink eye, meningitis, bacterial pneumonia, endocarditis, erysipelas, and necrotizing fasciitis (the 'flesh-eating' bacterial infections). However, many streptococcal species are not pathogenic, and form part of the commensal human <b>microbiota</b> of the mouth, skin, intestine, and upper respiratory tract. Furthermore, streptococci are a necessary ingredient in producing Emmentaler ("Swiss") cheese.|$|E
25|$|The vagina is {{a complex}} {{ecosystem}} that undergoes long-term changes, from neonate to puberty and from menarche to menopause. Healthy vaginal <b>microbiota</b> consists of species and genera which generally do not cause symptoms, infections, result in good pregnancy outcomes, and is dominated mainly by Lactobacillus species. Under the influence of hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), the vaginal ecosystem undergoes cyclic or periodic changes.|$|E
25|$|Small {{intestinal}} {{bacterial overgrowth}} occurs with greater frequency {{in patients who}} {{have been diagnosed with}} IBS compared to healthy controls. SIBO is most common in diarrhea-predominate IBS but also occurs in constipation-predominant IBS more frequently than healthy controls. Symptoms of SIBO include bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation among others. IBS {{may be the result of}} the immune system interacting abnormally with gut <b>microbiota</b> resulting in an abnormal cytokine signalling profile.|$|E
25|$|Early {{evidence}} {{suggested that}} antibiotic treatment of male partners could re-establish the normal <b>microbiota</b> {{of the male}} urogenital tract and prevent the recurrence of infection. However, a 2016 Cochrane review found high-quality evidence that treating the sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis {{had no effect on}} symptoms, clinical outcomes, or recurrence in the affected women. It also found that such treatment may lead treated sexual partners to report increased adverse events.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the normal}} range of volumes of flatus in normal individuals varies hugely (476–1,491ml/24h). All intestinal gas is either swallowed environmental air, present intrinsically in foods and beverages or the result of gut fermentation. Swallowing small amounts of air occurs while eating and drinking. This is emitted from the mouth by eructation (burping) and is normal. Excessive swallowing of environmental air is called aerophagia, and {{has been shown in}} a few case reports to be responsible for increased flatus volume. This is however considered a rare cause of increased flatus volume. Gases contained in food and beverages is likewise emitted largely through eructation, e.g., carbonated beverages. Endogenously produced intestinal gases make up 74 percent of flatus in normal subjects. The volume of gas produced is partially dependent upon the composition of the intestinal <b>microbiota,</b> which is normally very resistant to change, but is also very different in different individuals. Some patients are predisposed to increased endogenous gas production by virtue of their gut <b>microbiota</b> composition. The greatest concentration of gut bacteria is in the colon, while the small intestine is normally near sterile. Fermentation occurs when unabsorbed food residues may arrive in the colon. Therefore, even more than the composition of the <b>microbiota,</b> diet is the primary factor that dictates the volume of flatus produced. Diets that aim {{to reduce the amount of}} undigested fermentable food residues arriving in the colon have been shown to significantly reduce the volume of flatus produced. Again, it is emphasised that increased volume of intestinal gas will not cause bloating and pain in normal subjects. Abnormal intestinal gas dynamics will create pain, distension, and bloating, regardless of whether there is high or low total flatus volume.|$|E
25|$|The third {{trait that}} evolved in S. mutans {{is its ability}} to not only survive, but also thrive in acidic conditions. This trait gives S. mutans a {{selective}} advantage over other members of the oral <b>microbiota.</b> As a result, S. mutans could outcompete other species, and occupy additional regions of the mouth, such as advanced dental plaques, which can be as acidic as pH 4.0. Natural selection is most likely the primary evolutionary mechanisms responsible for this trait.|$|E
25|$|Fermentable fibers are {{consumed}} by the <b>microbiota</b> within the large intestines, mildly increasing fecal bulk and producing short-chain fatty acids as byproducts with wide-ranging physiological activities (discussion below). Resistant starch, inulin, fructooligosaccharide and galactooligosaccharide are dietary fibers which are fully fermented. These include insoluble as well as soluble fibers. This fermentation impacts the expression of many genes within the large intestine, which impact digestive function and lipid and glucose metabolism, {{as well as the}} immune system, inflammation and more.|$|E
25|$|The entire gut flora of a termite {{very closely}} related to N. corniger has been {{analysed}} using metagenomics to determine the function of different microbes in their gut. Typical to all wood-feeding higher termites, bacterial gut <b>microbiota</b> in the guts of N. corniger are dominated by insect-specific members of TG3_(candidate_phylum), Fibrobacteres, and Spirochaetes. It {{has also been shown}} that the same bacterial lineages are preferentially enriched in the cellulolytic bacterial community that is associated with wood particles in the gut.|$|E
25|$|The {{manipulation}} of the gut <b>microbiota</b> is complex and may cause bacteria-host interactions. Although probiotics are considered safe, when they are used by oral administration {{there is a risk}} of passage of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the internal organs (bacterial translocation) and subsequent bacteremia, which can cause adverse health consequences. Some people, such as those with immune compromise, short bowel syndrome, central venous catheters, cardiac valve disease and premature infants, may be at higher risk for adverse events.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major factor}} in {{petroleum}} demand is {{the widespread use of}} petroleum products such as plastic. These could be partially replaced by bioplastics, which are derived from renewable plant feedstocks such as vegetable oil, cornstarch, pea starch, or <b>microbiota.</b> They are used either as a direct replacement for traditional plastics or as blends with traditional plastics. The most common end use market is for packaging materials. Japan has also been a pioneer in bioplastics, incorporating them into electronics and automobiles.|$|E
25|$|Inulin's primary {{disadvantage}} is its tolerance. As a soluble fermentable fiber, it {{is quickly}} and easily fermented within the intestinal tract, which may cause gas and digestive distress at doses higher than 15 grams/day in most people. Individuals with digestive diseases have benefited from removing fructose and inulin from their diet. While clinical studies have shown changes in the <b>microbiota</b> at lower levels of inulin intake, some of the health effects require higher than 15 grams per day to achieve the benefits.|$|E
25|$|Both {{infectious}} and non-infectious {{causes for}} colitis exist. In the adult horse, Salmonella, Clostridium difficile, and Neorickettsia risticii (the causative agent of Potomac Horse Fever) are common causes of colitis. Antibiotics, which {{may lead to}} an altered and unhealthy <b>microbiota,</b> sand, grain overload, and toxins such as arsenic and cantharidin {{can also lead to}} colitis. Unfortunately, only 20–30% of acute colitis cases are able to be definitively diagnosed. NSAIDs can cause slower-onset of colitis, usually in the right dorsal colon (see Right dorsal colitis).|$|E
25|$|Many {{microbial}} symbionts, including human <b>microbiota,</b> can {{be transmitted}} both vertically and horizontally. Mixed-mode transmission can allow symbionts to have the “best of both worlds” – they can vertically infect host offspring when host density is low, and horizontally infect diverse additional hosts when a number of additional hosts are available. Mixed-mode transmission make the outcome (degree of harm or benefit) of the relationship more difficult to predict, because the evolutionary success of the symbiont is sometimes but not always tied {{to the success of}} the host.|$|E
25|$|Wearing dental {{appliances}} such as dentures {{alters the}} oral <b>microbiota.</b> A microbial plaque composed of bacteria and/or yeasts forms on the fitting {{surface of the}} denture (the surface which rests against the palate) and on the mucosa which is covered. Over time, this plaque may be colonized by Candida species. The local environment under a denture is more acidic and less exposed to the cleansing action of saliva, which favors high Candida enzymatic activity and may cause inflammation in the mucosa. C. albicans is the most commonly isolated organism, but occasionally bacteria are implicated.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} {{displacement}} is not definitively known, but one {{explanation is that}} the bowel becomes abnormally distended with gas (from excessive fermentation of grain, a change in the <b>microbiota</b> secondary to antibiotic use, or a buildup of gas secondary to impaction) which results in a shift in the bowel to an abnormal position. Because much of the bowel is not anchored to the body wall, it is free to move out of position. Displacement is usually diagnosed using a combination of findings from the rectal exam and ultrasonography.|$|E
25|$|Dry socket is {{more likely}} to occur where there is a {{pre-existing}} infection in the mouth, such as necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis or chronic periodontitis. Wisdom teeth not associated with pericoronitis are less likely to cause a dry socket when extracted. The oral <b>microbiota</b> has been demonstrated to have fibrinolytic action in some individuals, and these persons may be predisposed to developing dry sockets after tooth extraction. Infection of the socket following tooth extraction is different from dry socket, although in dry socket secondary infection may occur in addition.|$|E
