5|$|Another Green Wing {{series of}} running jokes is about hair. One {{of the more}} notable was various cracks about Mac's untidy hair, with Sue lending him a hair tie and hair clips before he goes in for an interview. Another was the {{character}} Karen getting her hair trapped in a printer in the first episode. Mac was {{often referred to as}} a Ginger by the other characters. Guy's hair becomes gradually curlier as the series goes on and Rachel dyes her hair from blonde to brunette after the first series. Other recurring jokes include Boyce's practical jokes, the bizarre games played by the human resources staff and surgery scenes where Caroline, Guy and Mac <b>mess</b> <b>around</b> while performing operations.|$|E

500|$|Blood {{was written}} and {{recorded}} {{in the same way}} as the first two OSI albums. Matheos and Moore worked together on the album long-distance, mainly by emailing each other files. Matheos would send Moore song ideas, [...] "from just a guitar riff to elaborate, almost completed songs," [...] Moore said. [...] "Then I ask what I can do, and I <b>mess</b> <b>around,</b> complete a verse and add a chorus, do editing, add some vocals, and send it back to him." ...|$|E

500|$|Regarding his remix of the album, O'Brien stated, [...] "The band {{loved the}} {{original}} mix of Ten, but were {{also interested in}} what it would sound like if I were to deconstruct and remix it...The original Ten sound is what millions of people bought, dug and loved, so I was initially hesitant to <b>mess</b> <b>around</b> with that. After years of persistent nudging from the band, I was able to wrap my head around the idea of offering it as a companion piece to the original—giving a fresh take on it, a more direct sound." ...|$|E
500|$|A doctor prescribes Prozac, a {{real life}} antidepressant, to Kyle for his {{apparent}} love for feces, which he describes as [...] "fecalphilia", a condition perhaps better known by the medical term coprophilia. Composer Philip Glass composes the avant-garde musical score for the non-denominational Christmas play. Stone and Parker both strongly dislike Glass; Parker, who was a music major in college, said, [...] "I really thought you could basically tell a third grader {{to sit down at}} a keyboard and <b>mess</b> <b>around</b> and sell it as a Philip Glass album, and no one would know the difference." [...] The do-it-yourself kit in the live action commercial, in which families can make their own Mr. Hankey, is similar to the Mr. Potato Head toy set.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Creep" [...] {{is set in}} {{the time}} {{signature}} of common time with a moderate tempo of 96 beats per minute. It was composed in the traditional verse–chorus form in the key of C minor with Watkins and Thomas' vocals ranging from the chords of C4 to F5. [...] "Yes, it's me again / And, I'm back," [...] Watkins introduces herself while opening the track in a [...] "husky" [...] voice. She then repeats the lines [...] "oh-I, oh-I, oh-I", which was compared by Spin Terry Sutton to Watkins finding [...] "a spiritual instruction in vowel sounds," [...] before going to the first verse of the song. In the first verse, the singer counts her relationship's [...] "twenty-second of loneliness" [...] and expresses how she still loves her boyfriend even acknowledging that he has been cheating on her. Moving on to the song's bridge, she suddenly uses a lower register to [...] "nonchalantly" [...] reveal: [...] "I'll never leave him down, though I might <b>mess</b> <b>around</b> / It's only cause I need some affection." [...] "So I creep / Yeah / And I'll just keep it on the down low," [...] she low-key sings the hook as if she is [...] "confessing to a chosen few." [...] Opening up the second verse, Watkins again counting her [...] "twenty-third of loneliness" [...] and still talks about her love for the partner despite signs of a broken romance. After performing the chorus again, her fellow member Thomas joins in to [...] "sweetly" [...] reveal the reason why's she cheating around is because she needs some attention from her lover. Watkins finally ends the track with the lines [...] "I creep around because I need attention / I don't <b>mess</b> <b>around</b> with my affection" [...] while fading out with the heavy beat and the horn sample. Billboard Larry Flick said the two's vocals in the track were [...] "tightly woven" [...] and [...] "rife with raspy grit," [...] which gave a nice contrast to the song's horn sample and funk guitars.|$|E
5000|$|... "Beatnik" [...] is a {{progressive}} rock-influenced song that is 3 minutes and 36 seconds long, and is played at a BPM of 104. Horn {{has stated that}} [...] "Things like 'Beatnik' were me just <b>messing</b> <b>around</b> with gear and just having a silly idea.

500|$|Loveless {{was largely}} {{recorded}} in mono sound, as Shields felt it {{important that the}} album's sound consisted of [...] "the guitar smack bang {{in the middle and}} no chorus, no modulation effect". Shields wavers his guitar's tremolo bar as he strums, which contributes, in part, to the band's distinctive sound. This technique—nicknamed [...] "Glide guitar"—causes the guitar strings to bend slightly in and out of tune. Shields said that due to his use of the tremolo bar, [...] "People were thinking it's hundreds of guitars, when it's actually got less guitar tracks than most people's demo tapes have." [...] The guitarist asserted that unlike other bands of the shoegazing movement of the early 1990s, My Bloody Valentine did not use chorus or flanger pedals. He insisted, [...] "No other band played that guitar like me [...] We did everything solely with the tremolo arm". Shields aimed to use [...] "very simple minimal effects" [...] which often were the result of involved studio work. He stated, [...] "The songs are really simply structured. A lot of them are purposely like that. That way {{you can get away with}} a lot more when you <b>mess</b> <b>around</b> with the contents". In a 1992 Guitar World interview, Shields described how he achieved a sound akin to a wah-wah pedal on [...] "I Only Said" [...] by playing his guitar through an amplifier with a graphic equaliser preamp. After recording the track, he then bounced it to another track through a parametric equaliser while he adjusted the EQ levels manually. The interviewer asked if Shields could have achieved the same effect more easily by simply using a wah-wah pedal, to which the guitarist replied, [...] "In attitude toward sound, yes. But not in approach." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Mysterious Ways" [...] {{began as}} an improvised demo called [...] "Sick Puppy" [...] that the group {{recorded}} at STS Studios in Dublin, as vocalist Bono, guitarist the Edge, and bassist Adam Clayton jammed over a drum machine. The band liked Clayton's bassline, which originated during their recording of a cover version of [...] "Night and Day" [...] and for a while, consisted of {{little more than a}} [...] "one-note groove." [...] However, the band had difficulties completing the remainder of the song melodically. Bono said that it was [...] "a bass line in search of a song," [...] while the Edge stated that [...] "the key to the song was finding ways to <b>mess</b> <b>around</b> with chords on top without having to change the bass." ...|$|E

Australia then wobbled, Allan Border out for 1, and Dean Jones out for a fourth ball duck, before ever {{reliable}} Steve Waugh joined David Boon, and the pair added the remaining 50 runs required for victory, the winning runs brought up by David Boon, who memorably swept Paul Jarvis to the square leg boundary for four to [...] win. Boon ended on 58 not out, and Waugh, 21 not out, was yet to be dismissed in the series. Steve Waugh was named man of the match for his first innings 152*, which set up the victory when the game was evenly poised.|$|E
