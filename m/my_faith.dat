25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have <b>my</b> <b>faith,</b> my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

25|$|We {{are entirely}} in accord in admitting the {{existence}} of God. How can I doubt His when I am convinced of mine. Who so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, {{it would be to}} doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now then, <b>my</b> <b>faith</b> in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: Plus Supra!...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.|$|E

500|$|Brosnan has {{expressed}} contempt for his education by the Christian Brothers. However, in 2013 he commented, [...] "It always {{helps to have}} a bit of prayer in your back pocket. At the end of the day, you have to have something and for me that is God, Jesus, my Catholic upbringing, <b>my</b> <b>faith...</b> God has been good to me. <b>My</b> <b>faith</b> has been good to me in the moments of deepest suffering, doubt and fear. It is a constant, the language of prayer... I might not have got my sums right from the Christian Brothers or might not have got the greatest learning of literature from them but I certainly got a strapping amount of faith." [...] Brosnan attends Mass, but adheres to other spiritual beliefs. In 2008 he said [...] "I also love the teachings of Buddhist philosophy. It's my own private faith. I don't preach it, but it's a faith that is a comfort to me when the night is long." ...|$|E

After every at bat after every play, it just keeps me grounded and keeps <b>my</b> <b>faith</b> strong and keeps my head and heart in the right place." [...] He reads the Bible daily.|$|E

He was quiet and gentle, and was [...] "a modest man, with a self-deprecating sense of humour". Miller {{described}} his own attitude towards music in a 2005 interview: I worked hard to maintain a certain mental and emotional equilibrium. It's mostly due to <b>my</b> <b>faith</b> in the Creator. I don't put all my eggs in that basket of being a rich and famous jazz guy. That allows me {{a certain amount of}} freedom, because I don't have to play music for money. I play music because I love it.|$|E

Tarwater said he was [...] "shocked" [...] by the news and called it a [...] "storybook ending" [...] to his career. [...] "I was really content in walking away last night.

He immediately boarded another plane and flew back to Omaha, where the Trials were held, for a team meeting and practice.

In August 2013, Ahmed Akkari expressed his regret {{for his role in}} the Imams' tour of the Middle East, stating [...] "I want to be clear today about the trip: It was totally wrong. At that time, I was so fascinated with this logical force in the Islamic mindset that I could not see the greater picture. I was convinced it was a fight for <b>my</b> <b>faith,</b> Islam." [...] Still a practising Muslim, he said that printing the cartoons was ok and he personally apologised to the cartoonist Westergaard. Westergaard responded by saying [...] "I met a man who has converted from being an Islamist to become a humanist who understands the values of our society. To me, he is really sincere, convincing and strong in his views." [...] A spokesman for the Islamic Society of Denmark said [...] "It is still not OK to publish drawings of Muhammad.

500|$|Lyricist {{and lead}} singer Tim Lambesis has given mixed {{commentary}} on the subject: when asked in 2008 if the members were [...] "a Christian band" [...] or [...] "Christians in a band", Lambesis stated on the band's FAQ, [...] "I'm {{not sure what the}} difference is between five Christians playing in a band and a Christian band, If you truly believe something, then it should affect every area of your life. All five of us are Christians. I believe that change should start with me first, and as a result, our lyrics do not come across very 'preachy.' Many of our songs are about life, struggles, mistakes, relationships and other issues that don't fit entirely in the spiritual category. However, all of these topics are written about through my perspective as a Christian." [...] Furthermore, during an August 2010 radio interview on the Christian metal radio show The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Lambesis stated [...] "I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally <b>my</b> <b>faith,</b> my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{all of his}} {{political}} campaigns, Romney has avoided speaking publicly about Mormon doctrines, referring to the U.S. Constitution's prohibition of religious tests for public office. But persistent questions {{about the role of}} religion in Romney's life, as well as Southern Baptist minister and former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee's rise in the polls based upon an explicitly Christian-themed campaign, led to the December 6, 2007, [...] "Faith in America" [...] speech. In the speech Romney declared, [...] "I believe in my Mormon faith and endeavor to live by it. <b>My</b> <b>faith</b> is the faith of my fathers. I will be true to them and to my beliefs." [...] Romney added that he should neither be elected nor rejected based upon his religion, and echoed Senator John F. Kennedy's famous speech during his 1960 presidential campaign in saying, [...] "I will put no doctrine of any church above the plain duties of the office and the sovereign authority of the law." [...] Instead of discussing the specific tenets of his faith, he said he would be informed by it, stating: [...] "Freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom. Freedom and religion endure together, or perish alone." [...] Academics would later study the role religion had played in the campaign.|$|E

500|$|A soprano recitative, [...] "" [...] (Alas! that <b>my</b> <b>faith</b> is yet so weak), {{adopts a}} {{modified}} version of the chorale melody as the continuo line. Gardiner notes the [...] "uncompromising" [...] way of changing the normal order: the soprano, usually singing a chorale cantus firmus (firm song) to the continuo, expresses weakness and insecurity here, marked [...] "a battuta", while the firm foundation is the chorale in the bass, to which the text of stanza three, [...] "" [...] (Therefore, I will hope in God), could be imagined. Gardiner points out a detail: the word [...] "Zeichen" [...] (sign) [...] "is given expressive, symbolic expression, a diminished seventh chord assigned to that word … formed by all three 'signs", one sharp (F-sharp), one flat (E-flat) and one natural (C). As Eric Chafe concludes, since St John's Gospel is known as the Book of Signs, and since the tonal plan of Bach's St John Passion appears to have been conceived as a form of play on the three musical signs (ie sharp, flat and natural key areas) this important detail in the plan of Aus tiefer Not perhaps possesses a wider significance, relating it to Bach's tonal-allegorical procedures in general.|$|E
500|$|The eighth {{track on}} the album is a cover of Bonnie Raitt's [...] "Love Letter" [...] (1989). [...] "The Man with the Child in His Eyes" [...] (1978) was {{described}} as an [...] "ethereal" [...] take on the Kate Bush song. Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone highlighted the original song [...] "5 Minutes Away" [...] as one of Natalie Cole's top ten essential songs, calling it [...] "a wise rumination on love and life accented by dry horns and capped with a rousing call-and-response". The tenth track is the original song [...] "Don't Say Goodnight (It's Time for Love)", written by Cole, Ernie Isley, and Chris Jasper. Cole explained that she included the cover of Des'ree's [...] "You Gotta Be" [...] (1994) as the eleventh song {{on the album}} due to the positive fan response to her prior performances of it; she described it {{as an example of}} her experimentation with [...] "bringing a jazzy flavor to some pop songs". The album concludes with a cover of Sting's [...] "If I Ever Lose <b>My</b> <b>Faith</b> in You" [...] (1993), which emphasizes its spiritual context through the addition of four Beatitudes. An acoustic version of [...] "Lovin' Arms" [...] featuring American blues musician Keb' Mo' was included as a digital bonus track.|$|E
500|$|David Giler {{performed}} a rewrite; Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins, friends of Spielberg, suggested the plot device of a kidnapped child. Spielberg {{then began to}} write the script. The song [...] "When You Wish upon a Star" [...] from Pinocchio influenced Spielberg's writing style. [...] "I hung my story on the mood the song created, the way it affected me personally." [...] Jerry Belson and Spielberg wrote the shooting script together. In the end, Spielberg was given solo writing credit. During pre-production, the title was changed from Kingdom Come to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. J. Allen Hynek, who worked with the United States Air Force on Project Blue Book, {{was hired as a}} scientific consultant. Hynek felt [...] "even though the film is fiction, it's based for the most part on the known facts of the UFO mystery, and it certainly catches the flavor of the phenomenon. Spielberg was under enormous pressure to make another blockbuster after Jaws, but he decided to make a UFO movie. He put his career on the line." [...] USAF and NASA declined to cooperate on the film. In fact, NASA reportedly sent a 20-page letter to Spielberg, telling him that releasing the film was dangerous. In an interview, he said: [...] "I really found <b>my</b> <b>faith</b> when I heard that the Government was opposed to the film. If NASA took the time to write me a 20-page letter, then I knew there must be something happening." ...|$|E
