5|$|The {{leopard shark}} captures prey by {{expanding}} its buccal cavity {{to create a}} suction force, which is facilitated by its labial cartilages swinging forward to form the mouth into a tube. Simultaneously, the shark protrudes its jaws forward to grip the prey between its teeth. As with other sharks, {{the teeth of the}} leopard shark are periodically shed and replaced; it takes 9ndash&12 days for a replacement tooth to <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>position.</b> Leopard sharks have been caught with stomachs filled with clam siphons, which the sharks seize before the clams can retract and break off with a levering motion of their bodies. On occasion, the shark tears the entire clam body out of its shell this way. Other sharks examined have had stomachs containing whole innkeeper worms with no bite marks, suggesting that the sharks sucked them out of their burrows. Under a hollow bridge support in San Francisco Bay, a group of leopard sharks and spiny dogfish have been observed feeding on a dense school of anchovies by slowly swimming counterclockwise through the clockwise-swimming school, and swallowing any anchovies that accidentally entered their open mouths.|$|E
5|$|In March 1909, Boyce {{embarked}} on a two-month trip to Europe, which included a visit to his daughters, who were in Rome. On returning to America, Boyce organized a photographic expedition to Africa with the innovative aerial photographer George R. Lawrence. Boyce met with safari organizers and outfitters and provisioned his expedition in London and Naples. His son Benjamin and Lawrence's son Raymond {{were part of the}} expedition. Cartoonist John T. McCutcheon joined the expedition while they were sailing from Naples to Africa. The group disembarked at Mombasa, Kenya, and was in Nairobi by September. After hiring local porters and guides, the entire expedition totaled about 400 people, about three-fourths of whom were servants. It required 15 train cars to move the people and equipment to the area the expedition was going to explore near Kijabi and Lake Victoria. The expedition was a failure because a telephoto lens was neither brought nor subsequently procured, the hot air balloons were not suitable for the conditions on the plains of East Africa, and the cameras were so large and noisy to <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>position</b> that the animals were scared away. The members of the expedition had to resort to buying photographs of big game animals from shops in cities such as Nairobi. The expedition did manage to successfully hunt several species of big game animals.|$|E

25|$|The units {{left their}} camps on January 16 to <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>position.</b> Major Green's units {{arrived at the}} {{southwest}} corner of Tule Lake at 1 pm; the artillery, which had traveled a longer, though flatter route, arrived after dark. Their camp {{was at the top of}} a bluff, overlooking the lava beds, about 3 miles west of the Stronghold.|$|E
25|$|As the {{invasion}} progressed, German infantry began receiving {{increasing numbers of}} the Pak 40 75mm, which were capable of penetrating the T-34's armour. Larger numbers of the 88mm Flak guns also arrived, which could easily defeat a T-34 even at long range, though their size and general unwieldiness meant that they were often difficult to <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>position</b> in the rough Russian terrain. The heavy German Tiger I tank appeared on the Eastern Front in late 1942, {{as a response to}} the T-34.|$|E
25|$|However, the Soviet {{occupation}} of Manchuria was {{long enough to}} allow the Communist forces to move in en masse and arm themselves with the military hardware surrendered by the Japanese army, quickly establish control in the countryside and <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>position</b> to encircle the Nationalist government army in major cities of northeast China. Following that, the Chinese Civil War broke out between the Nationalists and Communists, which concluded with the Communist victory in mainland China and the retreat of the Nationalists to Taiwan in 1949.|$|E

25|$|It took most of {{the morning}} on December 16 for the Federals to <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>position</b> against Hood's new line, which {{had been reduced to}} about 2 miles in length. Once again, Thomas planned a {{two-phase}} attack but concentrated on Hood's left. Schofield was to drive back Cheatham, and Wilson's cavalry was to swing to the rear to block the Franklin Pike, Hood's only remaining route of withdrawal. At noon, Wood and Steedman attacked Lee on Overton's Hill, but without success. On the left, Wilson's dismounted cavalry was exerting pressure on the line.|$|E
25|$|The coordinated Communist {{assault was}} {{scheduled}} to begin at 02:00 on 31 January. The 10th Sapper began its attacks on time, but the arrival and attacks of the PAVN infantry and artillery units were delayed by {{at least two hours}} by heavy rains and swollen streams and their lack of familiarity with the geography of Quảng Trị Province, and they did not start to <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>position</b> until about 04:00. As a result, Regional and Popular Forces, local National Police elements, and elements of the 1st ARVN Regiment located within the city were able to respond to the sappers without having to contend with the main attack at the same time.|$|E
25|$|From the {{official}} after-action reports for the Battle of Wilson's Creek (Oak Hills), the Pulaski Light Artillery performed like veterans, coolly and professionally. In fact, {{at least one}} regimental commander remarked that Woodruff's battery was key to the Southern victory. Captain Woodruff had {{had the foresight to}} have his battery limbered up, with horses standing in trace, at dawn on August 10. Thus, when the Union batteries opened on the Southern forces, the Pulaski Light Artillery was the first Confederate battery to be able to <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>position,</b> unlimber and open fire. Initially firing counter-battery salvoes to silence the Union guns, Woodruff's battery was then moved to a position to support an assault by Arkansas and Louisiana infantry on the Federal lines.|$|E

25|$|The 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment {{came under}} fire from Japanese machine gun and rifle fire from {{positions}} on high ground bordering a swampy area raked through the battalion, forcing them to seek cover in the knee deep mud and slime. Company L—on the extreme left—was under heavy fire and was reinforced quickly with a platoon from the reserve unit, Company K. Company L managed to fight its way through heavy enemy fire {{to the foot of}} a small knoll. Company I—with the battalion command group attached—was diverted to help and together they were able to rush and capture the rising ground. After the Japanese were cleared from the position, the battalion established a defensive perimeter and waited for 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment to <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>position</b> beside them.|$|E
25|$|After {{the attack}} {{aircraft}} had finished their bombing runs the six transports, {{which had been}} holding in wait to the east, commenced their formation run towards Cassinga {{at an altitude of}} 200 feet (60 m). Shortly before reaching the base, the six aircraft climbed to , the drop height, and lined up for the drop. However, required visual 'tracking and distance' co-ordination markers were obscured by smoke from the bombing run, the drop zone (DZ) box scaling and drop point distances were incorrect - due to the reconnaissance scaling errors - and the drop was a shambles with nearly all the paratroopers being dropped off-target, some on the West side of the river and some into tall maize where they had problems linking up. The resultant confusion caused numerous delays, ruining the schedule of the 'drop-to-contact' plan, and much of the advantage of surprise. The disastrous drop also meant that it would be nearly an hour before C-Company was able to <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>position</b> on {{the eastern side of the}} camp and seal off the escape routes and as a result a number of top PLAN commanders, including Dimo Amaambo and Greenwell Matongo (two principal targets of the attack) escaped (with Amaambo later becoming the first head of the Namibian Defence Force in 1990).|$|E
500|$|The {{collision}} with Glowworm tore off a [...] section of Admiral Hippers armored belt on the starboard side, {{as well as}} the ship's starboard torpedo launcher. Minor flooding caused a four degree list to starboard, though the ship was able to continue with the mission. Glowworms boilers exploded shortly after the collision, causing her to sink quickly. Forty survivors were picked up by the German ship. Admiral Hipper then resumed course toward Trondheim. The British destroyer had survived long enough to send a wireless message to the Royal Navy headquarters, which allowed the battlecruiser [...] time to <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>position</b> to engage Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, though the German battleships used their superior speed to break off contact.|$|E
5000|$|Pie Floaters were {{typically}} purchased {{in the street}} from pie-carts, as a late evening meal. Pie-carts are typically a form of caravan/trailer/cart, (originally horse-drawn), with an elongated [...] "window" [...] along one or both sides where customers sit or (more usually) stand to eat their purchases. The pie-cart was typically <b>moved</b> <b>into</b> <b>position</b> at lunch time and in the evening. As traffic became busier and on-street car-parking in demand, the carts evolved to have one window on [...] "the footpath side", and were <b>moved</b> <b>into</b> <b>position</b> after afternoon peak-hour traffic had ebbed. They do business until late-evening or early-morning, after which they were returned to their daytime storage locations.|$|R

500|$|The attack {{broke through}} the German defences in several places. By dawn, the attacking columns from the 51st (Highland) Division had reached their {{intended}} positions. The infantry dismounted from their Kangaroo APCs within [...] of their objectives at the villages of Cramensnil and Saint-Aignan de Cramesnil, rapidly over-running the defenders. The columns from the 2nd Canadian Division were delayed by fog and unexpected opposition on their right flank but by noon on 8 August, the Allied forces had captured Verrières Ridge. The novel methods used by Simonds ensured that the attackers suffered {{only a fraction of}} the loss which would have been incurred in a normal [...] "dismounted" [...] attack. The Allies were poised to move against Cintheaux, [...] south of their furthest penetration but Simonds ordered a halt, to allow field artillery and the 4th Canadian and 1st Polish [...] armoured divisions to <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>position</b> for the second phase of the operation.|$|E
500|$|As part of {{his command}} duties, Howe was chosen by Washington as {{president}} of the court–martial convened to determine the propriety of General Benedict Arnold's conduct while serving as the commandant of Philadelphia in 1778 and 1779. [...] During that time, Arnold was alleged to have conducted business with British merchants and to have undertaken private business transactions that were inappropriate given his position, among other improprieties. [...] The tribunal, which met at Howe's headquarters in Middletown, Connecticut, adjourned for several months due to a threatened British attack but reconvened in December 1779 and closed in January 1780. [...] During the interlude in the fall of 1779, Howe was ordered by Washington to <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>position</b> to attack the British in conjunction with an expected combined French naval and land-based assault, although the French assault in New York never materialized. [...] The court-martial rendered its decision on January 26, 1780, finding Arnold guilty of breaching the articles of war by permitting a vessel from an enemy port into Philadelphia and recommended that he be reprimanded by Washington.|$|E
500|$|On 14 May 1915, Thetis {{had taken}} the U-boat [...] under tow off Bogskär island in the Gulf of Finland. The Russian {{submarine}} [...] attacked the two German vessels, launching three torpedoes at Thetis and a fourth at U-4, all of which missed. From the recently captured naval base at Libau, the Germans began to make offensive operations further into the Baltic. [...] On 3 June, Thetis, four torpedo boats, and a seaplane tender attempted to force the Irben Strait into the Gulf of Riga, where they intended to lay a minefield. Russian and British submarines intercepted the flotilla in the Strait, however. The Russian submarine Okun attempted to <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>position</b> to attack Thetis, {{but one of the}} torpedo boats spotted her periscope and forced it off. On 5 June, the British submarine [...] arrived on the scene, while Thetis was resupplying from a collier. E9 launched a spread of torpedoes at the two ships; the one fired at Thetis missed, but the collier was hit, as was the torpedo boat [...] The collier sank, but the torpedo boat survived and made it back to port.|$|E

500|$|Many of the {{new players}} came to Liverpool because of a new {{scouting}} system created by Shankly in 1967 and placed {{under the control of}} new chief scout Geoff Twentyman, who had played for Shankly at Carlisle and had then spent several seasons at Liverpool, retiring shortly before Shankly's appointment. According to Stephen Kelly, hiring Twentyman as chief scout was [...] "perhaps Shankly's finest signing ever". It was through Twentyman that Liverpool found the new players and, after Shankly retired, Twentyman gave sterling service to Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan by finding players like Phil Neal, Alan Hansen and Ian Rush. As always, Shankly kept things simple and Twentyman was told to look for a prospect's basic qualities which were the abilities to pass the ball and <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>position</b> to receive a pass. Shankly also wanted Twentyman to check the player's personality and ensure he had the right attitude for a professional footballer. Above all, said Twentyman, [...] "he wanted to know if the lad had the heart to play for Liverpool". Although Shankly sometimes paid large transfer fees he was loath to do so and Twentyman's brief was [...] "getting them young so he (Shankly) could mould them into what he wanted".|$|E
500|$|The 24th Infantry Division was {{the first}} U.S. unit sent into Korea. The unit {{was to take the}} initial [...] "shock" [...] of North Korean advances, delaying much larger North Korean units to buy time to allow {{reinforcements}} to arrive. The division was consequently alone for several weeks as it attempted to delay the North Koreans, making time for the 1st Cavalry and the 7th and 25th Infantry Divisions, along with other Eighth United States Army supporting units, to <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>position.</b> Advance elements of the 24th Infantry, known as Task Force Smith, were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5, the first encounter between American and North Korean forces. For the first month after this defeat, the 24th Infantry was repeatedly defeated and forced south by superior North Korean numbers and equipment. The regiments of the 24th Infantry were systematically pushed south in engagements around Chochiwon, Chonan, and Pyongtaek. The 24th made a final stand in the Battle of Taejon, where it was almost completely destroyed but delayed North Korean forces until July 20. By that time, the Eighth Army's force of combat troops were roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region, with new UN units arriving every day.|$|E
