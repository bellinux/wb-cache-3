2500|$|Classicist Evelyn Stagg and theologian Frank Stagg {{believe that}} Paul was {{attempting}} to [...] "Christianize" [...] the societal household or domestic codes that significantly oppressed women and empowered men {{as the head of}} the household.

2500|$|The New Testament Household Codes (Haustafeln), {{also known}} as New Testament Domestic Codes, consist of {{instructions}} in the New Testament writings of the apostles Paul and Peter to pairs of Christian people in different domestic and civil structures of society. The main foci of the Household Codes are upon husband/wife, parent/child, and master/slave relationships. The Codes apparently were developed to urge the new first century Christians {{to comply with the}} non-negotiable requirements of Roman Patria Potestas law, and to meet the needs for order within the fledgling churches. The two <b>main</b> <b>passages</b> that explain these relationships and duties are Ephesians [...] and Colossians [...] An underlying Household Code is also reflected in 1Timothy2:1ff., 8ff.; 3:1ff., 8ff.; 5:17ff.; 6:1f.; [...] and [...] Historically, proof texts from the New Testament Household Codes—from the first century to the present day—have been used to define a married Christian woman's role in relation to their husbands, and to disqualify women from primary ministry positions in Christian churches. Others more positively interpret the Haustafeln passages to be [...] "Peter and Paul’s radical Christian 'remix' that often passes unnoticed by modern readers".|$|E

In several of these Columbus is mentioned, and also some of the chief events of his voyages, as promulgated {{at the very moment}} of his return. These letters not being generally known or circulated, or frequently cited, it may be satisfactory to the reader to have a few of the <b>main</b> <b>passages</b> which relate to Columbus. They have a striking effect in carrying us back to the very time of the discoveries.|$|E
6000|$|Establishments of any {{solidity}} or regularity the English {{have not}} in those parts; beyond the Alleghanies all is desert: [...] "from the Canada Lakes to the Carolinas, mere hunting-ground of the Six Nations; dotted with {{here and there}} an English trading-house, or adventurous Squatter's farm:"--to whom now the French are to say: [...] "Home you, instantly; and leave the Desert alone!" [...] The French have distinct Orders from Court, and energetically obey the same; the English have indistinct Orders from Nature, and do not want energy, or mind to obey these: confusions and collisions are manifold, ubiquitous, continual. Of which the history would be tiresome to everybody; and need only be indicated here by a mark {{or two of the}} <b>main</b> <b>passages.</b>|$|E
50|$|The cave {{entrance}} is a small, jagged opening in a gully {{at the base}} of low limestone cliffs. The <b>main</b> <b>passage</b> of the cave follows a deep fault in the limestone, dipping nearly due north. It descends through layers of limestone and shale, following a sink eroded by the gully stream. Side passages are rare except in an area called the Bedroom Complex, just past the halfway point of the <b>main</b> <b>passage.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the <b>main</b> <b>passage</b> flow through a high pressure turbine and the secondary flows due to leakage through the wheelspace rim seals is reviewed. Various experimental and analytical studies of these interactions are outlined and a numerical investigation of the {{interaction between}} the <b>main</b> <b>passage</b> flow and a wheelspace cavity seal flow is described. The numerical investigation uses a structured grid method to study the overall {{interaction between the}} turbine stage components and the wheelspace seal flow, and an unstructured grid method to resolve the detailed flow features within the geometrically complex cavity seal. The numerical results agree with various observations from experimental studies under similar flow conditions. As the flow rate through the rim cavity seal is increased, the ingestion of fluid from the <b>main</b> <b>passage</b> flow into the rim seal area decreases rapidly. A small amount of main flow gas is ingested into the rim seal area, even at high seal flow rates...|$|R

5000|$|In 1952 the Salt Lake Grotto of the National Speleological Society was established, {{and several}} weeks later the grotto's members {{obtained}} permission from the National Forest Service to explore the cave.

Teams from the grotto returned in 1953 and 1956, and in the last visit they succeeded in reaching the bottom of the <b>main</b> <b>passage.</b> They calculated a vertical depth of 1186 feet (361 meters), which was later revised to the present figure of 1163 feet (354 meters).

50|$|The reef is a {{breeding}} ground for many large billfish (marlin) species, sharks, tuna, giant trevally, mahi-mahi (dolphinfish) and snapper, due to it having many channels leading from extremely deep water into shallow lagoons. Parts of the reef, such as Naiqoro Passage, one of the <b>main</b> <b>passages,</b> are protected from fishing and require entry fees. This is because Naiqoro Passage {{is one of the main}} thoroughfares for large fish.|$|E
50|$|It {{consists}} of three <b>main</b> <b>passages.</b> From the entrance a stooping height passage heading south-east reaches a large 6 m deep pool after 330 m from which a stream emerges. This flows down a low passage to the north for some 270 m where a sump is reached. The third main passage continues south underwater from the pool for 225 m {{at a depth of}} 27 m where it reaches a junction and becomes too restricted.|$|E

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} space marching code is {{used for}} the numerical modelling of the flow in an isolated axial flow compressor rotor. The rotor is analyzed at four operating points, up to near stall conditions. Numerical results are first validated versus available experimental data and then further exploited in order to illuminate flow patterns in the inter-blade region. The tip leakage impact on the <b>main</b> <b>passage</b> flow and losses level as well as the effect of blade loading on the hub corner stall extent and the radial displacement of the flow are fully detailed. In order to account for the rotor geometry, the modifications performed in an existing software are mainly concerned with the accurate modelling of the clearance which is formed above the curved blade tip; for this purpose, a local H-type mesh is embedded to the <b>main</b> <b>passage</b> grid...|$|R
5000|$|Three-inch bars on a gate were {{supposed}} to further decrease the chances that someone might find the Jones' gold, silver, and jewels.

The west passage divides into two and ends in stairs which descend to the other two levels and lead to unfinished passages. The actual grave chamber had already been plundered when it was discovered.|$|E
50|$|As more {{of these}} rebel bands from Serbia appeared, in that way also the Ottoman government, and privately {{organized}} Turks and Albanians, became more active. Turk and Albanian bands were present on all <b>main</b> <b>passages</b> from the Serbian border to the Vardar river. These bands were also harassing in regions {{on the right side}} of the Vardar, and the number of atrocities grew. As a result of this pressure {{on the right side of}} the Vardar, Christians organized an uprising.|$|E
50|$|The <b>main</b> <b>passages</b> in Gavel Pot {{were first}} {{explored}} in 1970, when the Northern Pennine Club excavated a shaft {{in the final}} chamber. The upstream terminal sump was originally dived by Dave Yeandle. Geoff Yeadon descended the sump {{to a depth of}} 41 m in 1974, and the shaft was finally bottomed in 1985 by Rob Palmer. The downstream underwater connection with Lost Johns' Cave was made by Bob Churcher in 1975, and with Pippikin Pot in 1989 by Geoff Yeadon.|$|E
