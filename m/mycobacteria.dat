5|$|Linezolid is {{effective}} against all clinically important Gram-positive bacteria—those whose cell wall contains {{a thick layer}} of peptidoglycan and no outer membrane—notably Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococci), Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, the viridans group streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium species (the latter being among the most susceptible to linezolid, with minimum inhibitory concentrations routinely below 0.5mg/L). Linezolid is also highly active in vitro against several <b>mycobacteria.</b> It appears to be very effective against Nocardia, but because of high cost and potentially serious adverse effects, authors have recommended that it be combined with other antibiotics or reserved for cases that have failed traditional treatment.|$|E
5|$|The Mantoux {{tuberculin}} {{skin test}} {{is often used}} to screen people at high risk for TB. Those who have been previously immunized may have a false-positive test result. The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis. Interferon gamma release assays, on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test. These are not affected by immunization or most environmental <b>mycobacteria,</b> so they generate fewer false-positive results. However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii. IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test, but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of a commercial line probe assay (LiPA) (Inno-LiPA Mycobacteria; Innogenetics, Belgium) for the detection and identification of <b>Mycobacterium</b> species from liquid and solid culture was evaluated at five routine clinical laboratories. The LiPA method {{is based on the}} reverse hybridization principle, in which the mycobacterial 16 S- 23 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) spacer region is amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Amplicons are subsequently hybridized with oligonucleotide probes arranged on a membrane strip and detected by a colorimetric system. The test detects the presence of <b>Mycobacterium</b> species and specifically identifies <b>Mycobacterium</b> tuberculosis complex, <b>Mycobacterium</b> kansasii, <b>Mycobacterium</b> xenopi, <b>Mycobacterium</b> gordonae, <b>Mycobacterium</b> avium complex, <b>Mycobacterium</b> avium, <b>Mycobacterium</b> intracellulare, <b>Mycobacterium</b> scrofulaceum, and <b>Mycobacterium</b> chelonae - <b>Mycobacterium</b> abscessus complex. The results of LiPA were compared with the results obtained using traditional biochemical and molecular tests (DNA probe-based techniques, PCR restriction enzyme analysis of the 65 kDa heat-shock protein gene, and sequencing of the 16 S rDNA). A total of 669 isolates, 642 of which were identified as <b>Mycobacterium</b> species and 27 as non- <b>Mycobacterium</b> species, were tested by LiPA. After analysis of 14 initially discordant results and exclusion of one isolate, concordant results were obtained for 636 of 641 <b>Mycobacterium</b> isolates (99. 2 % accuracy).

25|$|Also {{in strong}} {{support of this}} {{hypothesis}} was the localization of M. ulcerans within the salivary glands of Naucoridae. Local physiological conditions of this niche appear to fit the survival and the replication needs of M. ulcerans but not those of other <b>mycobacteria.</b> Surprisingly, infiltration of the salivary glands of Naucoridae by M. ulcerans {{does not seem to}} be accompanied by any tissue damage similar to the ulcerative skin lesions developed by bitten individuals and mediated by the cytotoxic activity of the mycolactone and other toxins produced by M. ulcerans.

25|$|Pyrazinoic acid {{was thought}} to inhibit the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) I, which is {{required}} by the bacterium to synthesize fatty acids although this has been discounted. It was also suggested that the accumulation of pyrazinoic acid disrupts membrane potential and interferes with energy production, necessary for survival of M. tuberculosis at an acidic site of infection. However, since an acidic environment is not essential for pyrazinamide susceptibility and pyrazinamide treatment {{does not lead to}} intrabacterial acidification nor rapid disruption of membrane potential, this model has also been discounted. Pyrazinoic acid also binds to the ribosomal protein S1 (RpsA) and inhibits trans-translation, which may explain the ability of the drug to kill dormant <b>mycobacteria.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hazards {{associated}} with water systems in buildings include physical, chemical and microbial hazards. In 2013, NSF International, {{a public health}} and safety NGO, established education, training and certification programs in HACCP for building water systems. The programs, developed with the guidance of subject matter experts Aaron Rosenblatt and William McCoy center on the use of HACCP principles adapted to the specific requirements of domestic (hot and cold) and utility (HVAC, etc.) water systems in buildings, to prevent plumbing-associated hazards from harming people. Hazards addressed include scalding, lead, and disinfection byproducts as well as a range of clinically important pathogens, such as Legionella, Pseudomonas, nontuberculous <b>mycobacteria</b> (NTM), Acinetobacter, Elizabethkingia, and Naegleria. Early adopters of HACCP for building water systems include leading healthcare institutions, notably Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.|$|E

25|$|Infants {{can acquire}} lung infections before birth by {{breathing}} infected amniotic fluid {{or through a}} blood-borne infection which crossed the placenta. Infants can also inhale contaminated fluid from the vagina at birth. The most prevalent pathogen causing CAP in newborns is Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as group-B streptococcus (GBS). GBS causes {{more than half of}} CAP in the first week after birth. Other bacterial causes of neonatal CAP include Listeria monocytogenes and a variety of <b>mycobacteria.</b> CAP-causing viruses may also be transferred from mother to child; herpes simplex virus (the most common) is life-threatening, and adenoviridae, mumps and enterovirus can also cause pneumonia. Another cause of CAP in this group is Chlamydia trachomatis, acquired at birth but not causing pneumonia until two to four weeks later; it usually presents with no fever and a characteristic, staccato cough.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{manner in}} which ROS defends the host from invading microbe is not fully understood. One of the more likely modes of defense is damage to {{microbial}} DNA. Studies using Salmonella demonstrated that DNA repair mechanisms were required to resist killing by ROS. More recently, a role for ROS in antiviral defense mechanisms has been demonstrated via Rig-like helicase-1 and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein. Increased levels of ROS potentiate signaling through this mitochondria-associated antiviral receptor to activate interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, IRF-7, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), resulting in an antiviral state. Respiratory epithelial cells were recently demonstrated to induce mitrochondrial ROS in response to influenza infection. This induction of ROS led to the induction of type III interferon and the induction of an antiviral state, limiting viral replication. In host defense against <b>mycobacteria,</b> ROS play a role, although direct killing is likely not the key mechanism; rather, ROS likely affect ROS-dependent signalling controls, such as cytokine production, autophagy, and granuloma formation.|$|E

40|$|Strains of <b>Mycobacterium</b> {{are well}} known for their PAH {{degrading}} ability and are frequently found in PAH contaminated soils. <b>Mycobacterium</b> does not display flagella and is therefore considered non-motile. However, recently, sliding of <b>Mycobacterium</b> smegmatis over an agarose surface has been reported. To investigate if PAH degrading <b>Mycobacterium</b> strains show a similar sliding behavior and if the presence of PAHs influences this behavior, we have examined several PAH-degrading <b>Mycobacterium</b> isolates {{for their ability to}} perform phenanthrene accelerated motility in a soft agar swarm plate assay. Of five <b>Mycobacterium</b> strains, we found that the pyrene and phenanthrene utilizing <b>Mycobacterium</b> gilvum VM 552 and its derivative <b>Mycobacterium</b> gilvum KS 1, performe increased motility in the presence of phenanthrene. Both <b>Mycobacterium</b> gilvum VM 552 and <b>Mycobacterium</b> gilvum KS 1 also move towards phenanthrene when 1 mM D-glucose is present as an additional carbon source in the swim-agar medium but does not spread on plates which is solely amended with glucose. As for M. smegmatis, motility of <b>Mycobacterium</b> gilvum seems to be performed by sliding over the surface of the soft agar. The sliding motility is observed exclusively with agar concentrations below 0. 9 %. Interestingly, the wild type and the derivative strain demonstrate two different modes of motility. We interpret these results as evidence of a PAH induced motility and possibly a positive chemotactic mechanism in <b>Mycobacterium</b> gilvum VM 552 and its derivative <b>Mycobacterium</b> gilvum KS 1. Such a sliding behavior can be important in colonization by <b>Mycobacterium</b> of PAH contaminated soil. status: publishe...|$|R

500|$|TB {{infection}} {{begins when}} the <b>mycobacteria</b> reach the pulmonary alveoli, where they invade and replicate within endosomes of alveolar macrophages.

The phagosome then combines with a lysosome to create a phagolysosome. In the phagolysosome, the cell attempts to use reactive oxygen species and acid to kill the bacterium. [...] However, M. tuberculosis has a thick, waxy mycolic acid capsule that protects it from these toxic substances. M. tuberculosis is able to reproduce inside the macrophage and will eventually kill the immune cell.|$|E
