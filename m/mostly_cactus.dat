50|$|The Chichimeca bow {{and arrow}} was {{expertly}} crafted allowing for penetration of Spanish armor. There is two Spanish accounts of the Chichimeca’s archery skill that Powell writes in his book:On one occasion I saw them throw an orange into the air, and they shot into it so many arrows that, having held {{it in the air}} for much time, it finally fell in minute pieces” (Powell 48). “One of don Alonso de Castilla’s soldiers had an arrow pass through the head of his horse, including a crownpiece of double buckskin and metal, and into his chest, so he fell with the horse dead on the ground ‘this was seen by many who are still living’ (Powell 48).The Chichimeca were a nomadic culture making them very mobile and experts of rough terrain with vegetation filled (<b>mostly</b> <b>cactus)</b> land in which they always looked for hiding spots. “His long use of the food native to the Gran Chichimeca gave him far greater mobility than the sedentary invader, who was tied to domesticated livestock, agriculture, and imported supplies. The Chichimeca could and did cut off these supplies, destroy the livestock, and thus paralyze the economic and military vitality of the invaders; this was seldom possible in reverse” (Powell 44). They attacked in small groups ranging from five to two hundred warriors. In one account, with only fifty Zacateco warriors, the Chichimeca killed two thousand Spaniards. They had no shortage of raiding parties because of the highly valued supplies attracting warriors from far off allowing for the highest quality of trade goods.|$|E

50|$|The {{red-fronted macaw}} {{is native to}} a small mountainous area of south-central Bolivia {{situated}} about 200 km west of Santa Cruz, {{in the department of}} the same name, where the climate is medium altitude semi-desert. The natural vegetation consists <b>mostly</b> of <b>cactus</b> (large and small) and thorny trees and scrub. The climate is semi arid with cold nights and hot days. Rain comes in infrequent heavy storms. It is unusual in that it is the only macaw to inhabit such a climatic zone. Most macaws nest in holes in large trees, however here there are no very large trees in its range so it nests in vertical fissures in cliff faces. The bird has been captured for the pet trade in the past and killed by local farmers because it raids their crops.|$|R
500|$|The 1,500 to 1,800 {{species of}} <b>cacti</b> <b>mostly</b> fall {{into one of}} two groups of [...] "core cacti": opuntias (subfamily Opuntioideae) and [...] "cactoids" [...] (subfamily Cactoideae). Most members of these two groups are easily {{recognizable}} as cacti. They have fleshy succulent stems that are major organs of photosynthesis. They have absent, small, or transient leaves. They have flowers with ovaries that lie below the sepals and petals, often deeply sunken into a fleshy receptacle (the part of the stem from which the flower parts grow). All cacti have areoles—highly specialized short shoots with extremely short internodes that produce spines, normal shoots, and flowers.|$|R

Spike lives alone in the desert near Needles, California, only occasionally interacting with the principal characters in the strip, generally in visiting Snoopy. His friends are <b>mostly</b> inanimate saguaro <b>cacti.</b> In 1991's Snoopy's Reunion, Spike's home was a huge hollow saguaro in which he kept books and his fiddle. Spike is named after Charles Schulz's childhood dog.|$|R

5000|$|The Daisy Mountain Potential Preserve is a 6 sq mi undeveloped Arizona State Trust Land area {{straddling}} {{the communities of}} Anthem, Desert Hills, northern area of Phoenix and New River Arizona, {{open to the public}} if they have a State Land Department Recreation Permit. The form is at http://www.land.state.az.us/programs/natural/RecreationPermit.pdf. Residents of the surrounding area enjoy hiking, horse back riding, photography, bicycling, birding, and other recreational activities within the potential preserve. Motorized vehicles are restricted by Arizona State Trust Land [...] and Maricopa County Dust [...] regulations. There is no water due to limited precipitation over the desert landscape, though intermittent or seasonal washes do exist. There are no designated trails although the Maricopa County Regional Trail's [...] Anthem Trailhead is near-by and a number of informal trails providing paths exist and can be used by mountain bikers, hikers and horse-riders. Plant life consists <b>mostly</b> of <b>cacti</b> and dry shrubbery. A portion of the potential preserve seems to be limited to residents of the Anthem Country Club only, though there is a county easement from the Maricopa County Regional Trail through the Country Club to the Daisy Mountain Arizona State Trust land. Visitors are encouraged to use their judgement as to avoid intrusion onto Country Club property.|$|R

[...] The range is part of the Great Basin Desert and lies <b>mostly</b> within the <b>Cactus</b> Flat valley, consisting of horst and graben geology. [...] It is flanked by the Cactus Range hills to the west and the Kawich Range to the east, which is home of Silverbow, one of the largest mining ghost towns in Nevada. The vegetation consists mostly of black sagebrush and creosote bush. It holds a sizable wild horse and burro population, closely monitored by the Bureau of Land Management. Common denizens of the TTR include the gray fox, pronghorn, coyote, and mule deer, along with the native birds sage thrasher, sage grouse, and sage sparrow.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{close-up}} of a specimen of night blooming ceres (Ce'reus), ca. 1920.; "This popular group of cacti from South America consists of about 60 species. These vigorous-growing, <b>mostly</b> columnar-shaped <b>cacti</b> are easy to grow and make excellent container plants when small. Outdoors, when used as landscaping plants, these cacti will usually reach a height of 30 feet or more, growing up to 4 feet per year. Some branch at the top, resembling a candelabrum; others branch close to the base. In the spring or summer, their funnel-shaped flowers open at night closing as the sun rises. They may be white, pink or green and 6 to 8 inches long, growing near the plant's crown. The gorgeous blossoms are followed by green, red, or purple, edible fruits. C. validus grows up to 25 feet high with a spread of 10 feet. On new growth, its long spines are shiny black. When the stem reaches a height of 4 feet, beautiful flowers grow intermittently throughout the summer. The white blossoms are stained with salmon or pink. They are followed by greenish-purple fruits. C. hildmannianus var. Monstrose (Curiosity Plant; Giant Club) is an interesting variety forming a twisted, dark blue-green stem. The disfigured stem is caused by deformed growing points. The Curiosity Plant is covered with short, red or gold spines. It bears white flowers, which are followed by brown fruits. This plant can grow up to 15 feet high. C. aethiops is an attractive plant the forms clumps of tall, slender, blue-green stems adorned with contrasting black spines. When the stem is 3 or 4 feet high, it flowers {{several times in the}} summer. Its blossoms are followed by plum-shaped, purplish-brown fruits. This variety can reach a height of 10 feet.
