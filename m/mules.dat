5|$|Cagebird breeders {{sometimes}} breed bird hybrids {{known as}} <b>mules</b> between species of finch, such as goldfinch × canary.|$|E
5|$|Interspecific hybrids are bred by mating {{individuals}} from two species, normally {{from within the}} same genus. The offspring display traits and characteristics of both parents, but are often sterile, preventing gene flow between the species. Sterility is often attributed to the different number of chromosomes between the two species. For example, donkeys have 62 chromosomes, horses have 64 chromosomes, and <b>mules</b> or hinnies have 63 chromosomes. <b>Mules,</b> hinnies, and other normally sterile interspecific hybrids cannot produce viable gametes, because differences in chromosome structure prevent appropriate pairing and segregation during meiosis, meiosis is disrupted, and viable sperm and eggs are not formed. However, fertility in female <b>mules</b> has been reported with a donkey as the father.|$|E
5|$|A more {{immediate}} {{need for a}} canal covering the section between Givors and Rive-de-Gier emerged in the 1750s, when a cheaper method than pack <b>mules</b> was needed to carry coal to heat houses in Lyon and to fuel the glass works that had been opened in Givors in 1749. In 1751, there were 1,200 <b>mules</b> engaged in carrying the coal from Rive-de-Gier to Givors, from where it was taken by water north to Lyon and south to the towns of the Midi. Lyon was consuming 36,000 tons annually. The coal sold for 5 francs a ton at the mine head and 21.70 francs per ton at the Lyon docks.|$|E

50|$|Christian or Christen <b>Mule</b> (died 1589) was a {{merchant}} and Mayor of Oslo, Norway. He {{was probably a}} member of the family <b>Mule</b> from Denmark. <b>Mule's</b> parents have not been identified, but claims that he was the illegitimate son of the unpopular Hans Kristensson <b>Mule</b> were disputed by Edvard Bull the elder. Christian was the father of Thomas, Severin (Soren), Kristen, Bertel, and possibly Niels <b>Mule.</b>|$|R

5|$|As the stallions of the Poitevin breed {{could not}} be used to produce <b>mules,</b> they were {{generally}} sold as two-year-olds at the summer fair in Vendée and the winter fair in Saint-Maixent, as well as to horse merchants in Berry, Beauce, Perche and the Midi. In these areas, they were used for agriculture. In Paris, they were used for pulling omnibuses, and the French military used the Poitevin for pulling artillery. At the beginning of the 21st century there has been a new demand for <b>mules</b> for leisure purposes, but this demand cannot be filled by Poitevin mares until their numbers have recovered to a sufficient level.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, the French {{government}} {{tried to}} impose a system of crossing Poitevin horses with lighter-weight Norman and Thoroughbred horses to create cavalry horses. Despite financial incentives, private breeders protested because they felt that the resulting crossbred horses created poor quality <b>mules</b> upon further breeding. The changes also affected the characteristics of the breed that had been developed for work in its marshy homeland, including large hooves and a calm manner. Some sources argue that at this point the breed was employed for agricultural and logging uses. Others state that they were not pulling horses, and were instead used almost solely for the production of <b>mules.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Italian Heavy Draft was {{originally}} bred to be a versatile horse used in agriculture, urban settings, and military capacities, {{as well as}} for the production of large <b>mules</b> for the military. The breed's docility, size, strength, and speed made it extremely useful for Italian farmers before the introduction of mechanization. It is still used for farming in a few areas where mechanization is impractical. The mares are also still used for the production of <b>mules,</b> although most horses today are bred for meat. Italy is one of the top global consumers of horse meat; consumption jumped by 31 percent between 2001 and 2006. Eleven- to eighteen-month-old foals are preferred for slaughter.|$|E

5|$|Animals have {{repeatedly}} been used through {{the history of}} biomedical research. The founders, in 1831, of the Dublin Zoo {{were members of the}} medical profession, interested in studying the animals both while they were alive and when they were dead. In the 1880s, Louis Pasteur convincingly demonstrated the germ theory of medicine by inducing anthrax in sheep. In the 1880s, Robert Koch infected mice and guinea pigs with anthrax and tuberculosis. In the 1890s, Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to describe classical conditioning. In World War I, German agents infected sheep bound for Russia with anthrax, and inoculated <b>mules</b> and horses of the French cavalry with the equine glanders disease. Between 1917 and 1918, the Germans infected <b>mules</b> in Argentina bound for American forces, resulting in the death of 200 <b>mules.</b> Insulin was first isolated from dogs in 1922, and revolutionized the treatment of diabetes. On November 3, 1957, a Soviet dog, Laika, became the first of many animals to orbit the earth. In the 1970s, antibiotic treatments and vaccines for leprosy were developed using armadillos, then given to humans. The ability of humans to change the genetics of animals took a large step forwards in 1974 when Rudolf Jaenisch was able to produce the first transgenic mammal, by integrating DNA from the SV40 virus into the genome of mice. This genetic research progressed rapidly and, in 1996, Dolly the sheep was born, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell.|$|E

Broken, Channis reveals its location: Rossem.|$|R

5|$|Prior to the {{founding}} of the State of Israel, the Yishuv leadership anticipated an attack by regular Arab armies, of which Egypt's was the strongest in terms of manpower, arms and equipment. As such, Plan Dalet took stopping a potential Egyptian attack into account, and the Ad Halom (Sukrir) dual bridge over the Lakhish River was blown up as part of Operation Barak on May 12. In the eyes of the Givati command, this part of the operation was of marginal importance. A platoon from the 54th Battalion, two <b>mules</b> and 300 kilograms of explosives were allocated for it. The <b>mules</b> fled the scene, and the explosives were divided among the soldiers, who delivered them to the bridge. It took two attempts to destroy it, as some of the explosives did not work the first time.|$|E

5|$|The {{studbook}} for the Poitevin {{horse was}} created by the Société Centrale d'Agriculture des Deux-Sèvres on June 26, 1884, with a horse section and a donkey section. The first edition was released December 31, 1885, setting the physical criteria for the breeding and ending the practice of promoting crossbred horses as purebreds. It also marked the end of government intervention against the mule breeding industry, although bonuses were paid to encourage farmers to breed purebred horses. In 1902, a breeding syndicate to promote Poitou <b>mules</b> was created, but disappeared after a lack of advertising by stock breeders. On August 6, 1912, the French government released a decree officially supporting the mule breeding industry, backed by the purchase of <b>mules</b> by the French National Stud and bonuses given to the best stallions.|$|E
