50|$|The Semantic Object Model (SOM) (cf. Ferstl/Sinz) {{provides}} a framework for the conceptual modeling of system types. The <b>modeling</b> <b>concept</b> differentiates three levels of such systems: The strategic business plan; the operational business process models which focus on process types; and the specifications for implementing application systems. These levels can also be regarded as constituting perspectives on the system. They correspond to the external, internal, and resource perspectives. Subsequently, the levels of the model undergo a further conceptual division according to the organizational architecture, the process model, the principles of coordination or the object system.|$|E

50|$|The {{exploratory}} <b>modeling</b> <b>concept</b> {{makes it}} possible to use a wide variety of decision approaches using diverse types simulation models within a common analytic framework (depending on what seems most appropriate for a particular decision application). Within this common framework RDM analyses have used traditional sequential decision approaches, rule-based descriptions of adaptive strategies, real options representations, complicated optimal economic growth models, spreadsheet models, agent-based models, and organization's existing suites of simulation models such as one used by the U.S. government to forecast the future state of the social security trust fund.|$|E
50|$|Amplifier {{modeling}} (also {{known as}} amp modeling or amp emulation) {{is the process}} of emulating a physical amplifier such as a guitar amplifier. Signal processing within the <b>modeling</b> <b>concept</b> can be realized with analog or digital circuitry, or any combinations of the aforementioned. Digital amp modeling may appear as software, such as plugins for DAWs (Digital Audio Workstation) which may be aided by computer hardware accelerators, or may be part of a standalone device or amplifier. Amp modeling often seeks to recreate the sound of one or more specific models of vacuum tube amplifiers and sometimes also solid state amplifiers.|$|E
5000|$|Space-filling calotte {{models are}} also {{referred}} to as CPK models after the chemists Robert Corey, Linus Pauling, and Walter Koltun, who over a span of time developed the <b>modeling</b> <b>concept</b> into a useful form. They are distinguished from other 3D representations, such as the ball-and-stick and skeletal models, by the use of the [...] "full size" [...] space-filling spheres for the atoms. They are useful for visualizing the effective shape and relative dimensions of the molecule, and the shapes of surface a given static conformer might present. On the other hand, these models mask the chemical bonds between the atoms, and make it difficult to see the structure of the molecule that is obscured by the atoms nearest to the viewer in a particular pose. For this reason, such models are of greater utility if they can be used dynamically, especially when used with complex molecules (e.g., see the greater understanding of the molecules shape given when the THC model is clicked on to rotate).|$|E

40|$|There {{is ample}} {{experimental}} evidence that complications in water flow and pesticide transport {{can occur in}} cultivated humic-sandy and loamy-sandy soils. As a result, pesticide leaching to groundwater and water courses can be higher than expected. We made an inventory of mechanistic/deterministic <b>model</b> <b>concepts</b> that may be suitable for simulating preferential water flow and pesticide transport in these soils. The convection-dispersion approach, the mobile-stagnant concept, the dual-velocity concept, the explicit description of horizontal diffusion, the soil column approach and a concept of finger flow are discussed. Only for comparatively simple concepts it is feasible to ever obtain the parameter values. Ideally, the data sets {{to be used for}} testing the <b>models</b> <b>concepts</b> should be detailed and complete. Discrimination between the validity of the <b>model</b> <b>concepts</b> requires the variation in the measuring results to be limited.

40|$|Abstract Here, we {{introduce}} a modular and hierarchical <b>modeling</b> <b>concept</b> for large biological Petri nets. This <b>modeling</b> <b>concept</b> suggests representing every functional system {{component of a}} molecular network by an autonomous and self-contained Petri net, so-called module. Due to the specific architecture of the modules, they need to fulfill certain properties important for biological Petri nets to be valid. The entire network is build-up by connecting the modules via common places corresponding to shared molecular components. The individual modules are coupled {{in a way that}} the structural properties that are common to all modules apply to the composed network as well. We applied this <b>modeling</b> <b>concept</b> on nociceptive signaling in DRG-neurons to compose a model describing pain on a molecular level for the first time. We verified the applicability of our <b>modeling</b> <b>concept</b> for very complex components and confirmed preservation of the properties after module coupling. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of the computer-aided modeling simulation environment PRoMoT/DIVA to the modeling of (reactive) distillation processes is presented.

One important point of the <b>modeling</b> <b>concept</b> and the subsequent design of the knowledge base of PRoMoT is the decomposition of individual process units into physically meaningful, finer grained modeling entities on different hierarchical levels. The hierarchical levels considered thus far are the process unit level, the phase level, and the storage level. This contribution focuses mainly on the definition of the modeling entities on the phase level, which are important for the modeling of (reactive) distillation processes. Furthermore, the design of the object-oriented knowledge base of PRoMoT that contains these modeling entities is illustrated. (24 References...|$|E

First, while the <b>model</b> <b>concept</b> frequently is mentioned in the philosophical literature on scientific knowledge, it rarely is addressed as a focus for methodology. My aim is to support the view that models are central to scientific practice, and that for this reason, the <b>model</b> <b>concept</b> deserves further attention in general philosophy of science. Second, I hold that since models {{are an important part of}} scientific inquiry, various philosophical puzzles arise as a consequence of an analysis of the <b>model</b> <b>concept.</b> In particular, I investigate the problem of constructivism about scientific models for a realist view of science, and I urge that although it may be tempting to adopt an anti-realist position, methodological considerations demand that one must be a realist about the <b>model</b> <b>concept...</b>|$|R
