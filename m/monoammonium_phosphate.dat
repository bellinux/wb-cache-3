The interdisciplinary nature of this research focused at the interface of materials science, biotechnology and conservation science develops tailored sustainable conservation treatments, which consider fundamental aspects of substrate chemistry and structure to prescribe and metricate treatment protocols. The scientific approach exploits biomimetic principles to induce the formation of HAP crystals by triggering reactions between the Ca-rich substrates of wall paintings and ammonium phosphate precursors such as diammonium hydrogen phosphate (DAP, NH 4) 2 HPO 4), and ammonium dihydrogen also known as <b>monoammonium</b> dihydrogen <b>phosphate</b> (MAP, NH 4 H 2 PO 4). Tests were carried out on simulated wall painting panels and on original archaeological substrates in situ. The consolidating effect, influence of the solution and conditions such as concentration and contact time {{on the extent of}} hydroxyapatite formation was evaluated through a series of structurally and compositionally sensitive analytics including scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, X-ray diffraction, micro-Raman Spectroscopy, mechanical and fluid-transport analyses. Thermodynamic modeling was also performed to evaluate the stable phase equilibria between CaCO 3 and (NH 4) 2 HPO 4 / NH 4 H 2 PO 4 solutions and interpret the HAP formation in aqueous solution. Calculations demonstrated hydroxyapatite precipitation in the systems consisting of CaCO 3 /(NH 4) 2 HPO 4. From a purely scientific perspective, the research develops new information to relate: (1) the chemical interactions, thermodynamics and kinetics of reactions between the phosphate reactants and CaCO 3, the main component in the stone, plaster or mortar, at various pH levels to the formation of orthophosphates such as HAP and rate/extent of consolidation (2) the impact of HAP formation within the decohesive layers in terms of microstructure-linked, fluid-transport, mechanical, durability and optical properties and (3) the chemical interactions of the reactant precursors with different pigments present in the surface paint layers. Acquired data show the potential of this treatment for the consolidation of powdery calcium carbonate-based surfaces and their protection from weathering and deterioration induced by passage-of-time and environmental action linked effects. These efforts develop quantitative materials science-based structure/property relations to engineer practical, prescriptive consolidation solutions in relation to the reactant chemistry, the substrate properties and the treatment application method relevant to the materials...|$|R

Recent field trials on calcareous soils in southern Australia have shown that fluid fertilizers may provide a useful alternative to granular fertilizer products. Fluid sources of P enhance P uptake and yield when compared with granular fertilizers applied at the same rate. This work aimed to compare the behavior of one fluid (technical grade <b>monoammonium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> TG-MAP) and one granular (<b>monoammonium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> MAP) form of P fertilizer in a highly calcareous soil. Changes in soil pH, P diffusion, solubility, and lability (using isotopic dilution techniques) were determined at different distances from the point of application over 5 wk. Furthermore, reaction products in MAP granules were investigated using spectroscopic techniques. The results indicated that P from fluid TG-MAP diffused more and was more available than P supplied as granular MAP. Also, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray microanalyses (EDXMA) of the MAP granules indicated that a significant percentage (12 %) of the initial P remained in the granules even after 5 wk of incubation in the soil. The enhanced P availability of fluid fertilizers observed in field trials compared with granular forms is discussed in relation to differences in the dissolution, diffusion, and reaction processes in soils.

40|$|Copyright © 2006 Soil Science Society of AmericaWe {{employed}} x-ray computed microtomography (X-ray CT) {{to observe}} differences in moisture around fertilizer P granules (<b>monoammonium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> MAP) versus injection zones of fluid P fertilizer (technical grade <b>monoammonium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> TG MAP) in a calcareous soil over time. X-ray CT allows nondestructive visualization of small columns containing soils and fertilizers. We {{were able to}} visualize the increase in density around the highly hygroscopic fertilizer granule over time. It appeared that both water flow toward the granule and precipitation of P could {{be responsible for the}} development of about 1 mm thick high density zone immediately adjacent to the granule. The mass flow of water toward the granule may have slowed or restricted the diffusion of fertilizer P from the granule, thus increasing the chances for P fixation through precipitation reactions. Also, the granule became less dense with time indicating the progress of granule dissolution. In contrast, injection of fluid fertilizer (TG-MAP) in soil did not result in moisture changes over time as evidenced by a lack of X-ray CT detectable density differences in the soil column. These data support previous findings that, when P is supplied in granular form, P diffusion and isotopic lability in calcareous soils are reduced compared with equivalent liquid fertilizer formulations, probably due to precipitation reactions induced by osmotically induced flow of soil moisture into the fertilizer granule.

30|$|A {{significant}} problem of some phosphorus based fire retardants (e.g. <b>monoammonium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> MAP), encountered predominantly in the United States, is the in-service reductions in strength of treated wood products (particularly plywood roof sheathing).

It is attributed to both the initial pH of the wood and the buffering capacity of the fire retardant system (Winandy 1995). As a result, boron treatments were advocated as the solution to the phosphate problem (Winandy and Herdman 2003; Winandy and McNamara 2003; Winandy and Richards 2003).
