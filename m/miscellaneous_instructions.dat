50|$|The machine {{instructions}} can {{be grouped}} into six categories: accumulator instructions, branch instructions, memory reference instructions, address register instructions, scratchpad register instruction, <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>instructions</b> (interrupt, input, output, indirect scratchpad register, load, and store).|$|E
50|$|There {{are a few}} {{additional}} <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>instructions,</b> {{and there}} are some changes to the terminology (the PICmicro OPTION register is called the CONTrol register; the PICmicro TRIS registers 1-3 are called I/O control registers 5-7), but the equivalents are obvious.|$|E

50|$|These devices {{feature a}} 14-bit wide code memory, and an {{improved}} 8 level deep call stack. The instruction set differs very little from the baseline devices, but the 2 additional opcode bits allow 128 registers and 2048 words of code {{to be directly}} addressed. There are a few additional <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>instructions,</b> and two additional 8-bit literal instructions, add and subtract. The mid-range core {{is available in the}} majority of devices labeled PIC12 and PIC16.|$|E

In the following year went to the Netherlands and commanded the artillery of the 3rd Division at the battles of Quatre Bras and Waterloo. He received the Waterloo Medal, and was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath, military division, in 1815. He served with the army of occupation in France, until his promotion to be regimental lieutenant-colonel on 24 March 1817, after he {{returned to}} England. He was for some time superintendent of the Royal Military Repository at Woolwich, and prepared a new and extensive course of instruction in artillery, which {{formed the basis of}} the exercise of heavy ordnance and of <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>instructions</b> of the gunner for many years after his time. On 29 July 1825, he was promoted to colonel. Williamson died at Woolwich on 26 April 1836.|$|E
40|$|Two factors, which affect {{simulation}} quality are {{the amount}} of computing power and implementation. The Streaming SIMD (single instruction multiple data) extensions (SSE) present a technique for influencing both by exploiting the processor's parallel functionalism. In this paper, we show how SSE improves performance of lattice gauge theory simulations. We identified two significant trends through an analysis of data from various runs. The speed-ups were higher for single precision than double precision floating point numbers. Notably, though the use of SSE significantly improved simulation time, it did not deliver the theoretical maximum. There {{are a number of}} reasons for this: architectural constraints imposed by the FSB speed, the spatial and temporal patterns of data retrieval, ratio of computational to non-computational instructions, and the need to interleave <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>instructions</b> with computational instructions. We present a model for analyzing the SSE performance, which could help factor in the bottlenecks or weaknesses in the implementation, the computing architecture, and the mapping of software to the computing substrate while evaluating the improvement in efficiency. The model or framework would be useful in evaluating the use of other computational frameworks, and in predicting the benefits that can be derived from future hardware or architectural improvements.
