The ``Needs Analysis`` survey found the greatest problem was the inability to identify in situ decalibration (drift).

40|$|Conventional {{industrial}} glass furnaces show broad glass melt {{residence time}} distributions in the melting tanks and average residence times may {{be up to}} more than two days for high quality glass products, such as float glass or TV glass, despite the minimum residence times of 8 - 10 hours (or even less than 4 hours for container glass furnaces). Long residence times are associated with large <b>melt</b> <b>tank</b> volume/pull rate ratios and high structural heat losses. The recirculation flows, necessary to supply the batch blanket with sufficient energy for the fusion processes of the batch materials, are often poorly controlled and cause these shown residence time differences. For each elementary process step the most relevant process parameters in terms of desired flow patterns, mixing behavior, temperature, chemistry and required time for completion of the process step are analyzed. From this analysis, it is concluded that the different steps need very different conditions comparing the processes with each other. Therefore glass furnace design modifications should be focused on the development of furnaces with segments, each of them dedicated and optimized for the a certain stage of the melting process: melting-in of batch, sand grain dissolution, removal of gases (bubbles and dissolved gases), re-absorption of residual bubbles and glass melt (chemical and thermal) homogenization. Some developments in fast fining and rapid melting-in of batch will be shown and shortly discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we report the results {{obtained}} using a kernelbased approach to predict the temporal development of four response signals in the process control of a glass <b>melting</b> <b>tank</b> with 16 input parameters.

The methodology proposed here comprises Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Regularization Networks (RN). We use the idea of sparse approximation both as a means of regularization and as a means of reducing the computational complexity. Furthermore, we will use an incremental approach to add new training examples to the kernel-based method and efficiently update the current solution. This allows us to use a sophisticated learning scheme, where we iterate between prediction and training, with good computational efficiency and satisfactory results. ...|$|R

40|$|Float {{glass melting}} {{furnaces}} {{are characterized by}} their large sizes (60 m in length, 10 m in width, 1 m in depth). The physical and chemical processes {{taking place in the}} glass bath and the combustion chamber are complex.

A comprehensive transient and steady state, three-dimensional physical-mathematical model and computer program have been developed to predict the circulations and heat transfer in float glass melting furnaces. The submodels of the system model include combustion chamber, batch melting, glass circulation and heat transfer in the glass bath, waist cooler, electric boosting, air cooling in the working end and bottom steps.

Model Predictive Control (MPC) technology, which was developed in the chemical industry, was introduced in the glass industry for control of forehearths and crown temperatures in glass <b>melting</b> <b>tanks.</b> The mathematical (black box) models used in these controllers were determined from process data. To this end tests were performed on the process so that the time dependent behavior of the process could be observed and the model parameters could be estimated.

This reference situation was selected by the 21 st Technical Committee of the International Commission on Glass. Following this, a reduced-scale mixed electrical-fuel furnace is studied, allowing the modeling of unsteady boosting heat transfer. Finally an unsteady advection-diffusion problem is solved to represent the mixing of two different types of glasses. The interest in unsteady modeling is two-fold: (1) the accurate time evolution of flow and temperature sheds light on the structure and stability of the flow related to a given set of physical properties and boundary conditions; and (2) the transient solution gives reproducible and inexpensive information for the definition of a control process.

The description of processes, which are taking place during the glass melting, is for the high temperature very difficult. Therefore we can use either physical modelling or mathematical modelling. For mathematical modelling was the CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) code Fluent and Fluent/UNS used. The thesis is divided in three parts. In the first part, the combustion space of glass melting furnace was modelled, where the temperature distribution influence on fuel input was predicted. The influence was studied {{on the model of}} the FLOAT Nashville furnace. The modelled variants are proposed to simulate the temperature maximum shifting, extension of temperature maximum range, boosting using fuel input changing to the ports. The modelling results were compared with measured data (TC 21) and with the results from other modelling laboratory (TNO). The results show very good agreement with measured data. The second part deals with <b>melting</b> <b>tank</b> modelling. This model was used to simulate the melting conditions during melting life of the furnace, where the corrosion has a very important influence on the cooling rate and on the throat-temperature.

40|$|Two fused {{chloride}} salt eutectics, binary LiCl-KCl and ternary NaCl- KCl- MgCl/sub 2 /, {{were used}} in fuel processing studies {{as part of the}} Liquid Metal Fuel Reactor research and development program. Results of engineering work done at Brookhaven since 1950 are summarized. It was demonstrated that fused chloride salt technology is sufficiently developed so that loops and other experimental equipment can be designed and operated at 500 deg C {{with a high degree of}} confidence. The equipment, which was operated for many hours, included a large forced-circulation loop and many thermal-convection loops and tanks. The specifications used for the fabrication, cleaning, and testing of equipment for salt service are described. All welded systems, welded by the usual inert-arc procedures, are preferred, but ring type joint stainless-steel flanged connections were found satisfactory, mainly for connecting <b>melt</b> <b>tanks</b> to experimental equipment and for mounting orifice flowmeters. The surfaces of equipment to be used with fused salts were cleaned satisfactorily prior to assembly by several different methods, but sandblasting was found applicable to all types of equipment. Radiography was used to check all welds in contact with fused salt for flaws and, during operation, to locate and determine the cause of any malfunction. Components tested at the normal operating temperature of 500 deg C included pumps, valves, agitators, sightports, samplers, and filtens. Salt samples were usually taken by the thief method. Both stationary and movable resistance type, liquid-level probes were used and were reliable so long as the salt surface remained quiescent; otherwise, splashing and short-circuiting occurred. Nullmatic, pilot-operated pressure transmitters gave good service in conjunction with both orifice and Venturi flowmeters. A procedure is described for preparing pound quantities of pure eutectics, which, in the case of the ternary eutectic, differs from that used in preparing gram quantities. Both eutectics were pretreated with a Bi- Mg-U solution to remove oxidizing impurities before use in corrosion and processing experiments. The results of physical property measurements on the two eutectics are included. (auth...|$|R
