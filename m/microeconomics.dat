5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and 1980s, new Keynesian {{researchers}} investigated how market imperfections like monopolistic competition, nominal frictions like sticky prices, and other frictions made <b>microeconomics</b> consistent with Keynesian macroeconomics. New Keynesians often formulated models with rational expectations, {{which had been}} proposed by Lucas and adopted by new classical economists.|$|E
5|$|In <b>microeconomics,</b> the PPF {{shows the}} options open to an individual, household, or firm in a two-good world. By definition, each {{point on the}} curve is productively efficient, but, {{given the nature of}} market demand, some points will be more {{profitable}} than others. Equilibrium for a firm will be the combination of outputs on the PPF that is most profitable.|$|E
5|$|New {{classical}} economics {{had pointed}} out the inherent contradiction of the neoclassical synthesis: Walrasian <b>microeconomics</b> with market clearing and general equilibrium could not lead to Keynesian macroeconomics where markets failed to clear. New Keynesians recognized this paradox, but, while the new classicals abandoned Keynes, new Keynesians abandoned Walras and market clearing.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} disciplines, the initial {{emphasis}} of feminist economists was to critique the established theory, methodology, and policy approaches. The critique began in <b>microeconomics</b> {{of the household}} and labor markets and spread to macroeconomics and international trade, ultimately extending to all areas of traditional economic analysis. Feminist economists pushed for and produced gender aware theory and analysis, broadened the focus on economics and sought pluralism of methodology and research methods.|$|E
5|$|The {{generation}} of economists that followed Keynes synthesized his theory with neoclassical <b>microeconomics</b> {{to form the}} neoclassical synthesis. Although Keynesian theory originally omitted an explanation of price levels and inflation, later Keynesians adopted the Phillips curve to model price-level changes. Some Keynesians opposed the synthesis method of combining Keynes's theory with an equilibrium system and advocated disequilibrium models instead. Monetarists, led by Milton Friedman, adopted some Keynesian ideas, such as {{the importance of the}} demand for money, but argued that Keynesians ignored the role of money supply in inflation. Robert Lucas and other new classical macroeconomists criticized Keynesian models that did not work under rational expectations. Lucas also argued that Keynesian empirical models would not be as stable as models based on microeconomic foundations.|$|E
5|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of <b>microeconomics.</b> In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.|$|E
5|$|Basic Guides were {{formerly}} {{issued for}} students which, unlike the Resource Guides, {{remained the same}} from year to year. The Art Basic Guide focuses on art fundamentals, such as the elements of art, principles of composition, and different 2-D and 3-D techniques. Additionally, a brief introduction to art history is included. The Economics Basic Guide reviews fundamental economic concepts {{in addition to the}} basics of macroeconomics and <b>microeconomics.</b> The Language and Literature Basic Guide provides students with a basic grounding in the analysis of literature and introduces key terms such as synecdoche, metonymy, assonance, and aphorism. The Math Basic Guide offers a general overview of major topics in high school math, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and statistics. The Music Basic Guide begins by introducing the student to topics in music theory such as harmonics, rhythm, tempo, and the circle of fifths. It also includes information {{on a wide variety of}} instruments and a brief history of Western music. However, beginning in the 2010â€“2011 competition season, the Basic Guides were incorporated into the year's Resource Guides.|$|E
5|$|In general, the {{objective}} events follow a set organizational outline {{from year to}} year. Language and literature focuses on a single novel or a set of plays in addition to multiple short literary selections {{which tend to be}} poems or excerpts from short stories. The art and music sections include several selections with which students must familiarize themselves in addition to historical information. Economics remains fairly static; 85% of the material focuses on a standard course of macroeconomics and <b>microeconomics</b> and the remaining 15% focuses on the year's topic. For example, in 2005 the themed material covered the economics of ancient Egypt and Rome. Science and social science reflect the season's theme. Unlike the other events, there is no basic information that carries over. The math curriculum has varied as well, occasionally dropping and adding new subjects or shifting the weight of particular subjects.|$|E

25|$|The {{side-effects}} {{of taxation}} (such as economic distortions) and theories {{about how best}} to tax are an important subject in <b>microeconomics.</b> Taxation is almost never a simple transfer of wealth. Economic theories of taxation approach {{the question of how to}} maximize economic welfare through taxation.|$|E
25|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} dominates <b>microeconomics,</b> {{and together}} with Keynesian economics forms the neoclassical synthesis which dominates mainstream economics today. Although neoclassical economics has gained widespread acceptance by contemporary economists, {{there have been}} many critiques of neoclassical economics, often incorporated into newer versions of neoclassical theory.|$|E
25|$|In <b>micro{{economics}},</b> neoclassical economics represents {{incentives and}} costs as playing a pervasive {{role in shaping}} decision making. An immediate {{example of this is}} the consumer theory of individual demand, which isolates how prices (as costs) and income affect quantity demanded. In macroeconomics it is reflected in an early and lasting neoclassical synthesis with Keynesian macroeconomics.|$|E
25|$|Noted American legal {{philosophers}} Ronald Dworkin and Richard Posner work in {{the fields}} of political philosophy and jurisprudence. Posner is famous for his economic analysis of law, a theory which uses <b>microeconomics</b> to understand legal rules and institutions. Dworkin is famous for his theory of law as integrity and legal interpretivism, especially as presented in his book Law's Empire.|$|E
25|$|Other modern {{schools of}} {{economic}} thought are New Classical economics and New Keynesian economics. New Classical economics {{was developed in}} the 1970s, emphasizing solid <b>microeconomics</b> as the basis for macroeconomic growth. New Keynesian economics was created partially in response to New Classical economics, and deals with how inefficiencies in the market create a need for control by a central bank or government.|$|E
25|$|<b>Microeconomics</b> {{examines}} how entities, forming a market structure, interact within a market {{to create a}} market system. These entities include private and public players with various classifications, typically operating under scarcity of tradable units and light government regulation. The item traded may be a tangible product such as apples or a service such as repair services, legal counsel, or entertainment.|$|E
25|$|Micrological {{theories}} of economy consider acts {{of a group}} of individuals. Economic theory {{is based on the assumption}} that when the highest bidder succeeds the market clears. <b>Microeconomics</b> theories believes that individuals are going to find the cheapest way to buy the things they need. By doing this it causes providers to be competitive and therefore creates order in the economy.|$|E

He later attended several schools in Pakistan. In high school, he received Ds in English composition and <b>microeconomics.</b> While he was growing up, the family had servants, chauffeurs, and armed guards {{in keeping with his}} father's military rank.|$|E
25|$|Twenty dual {{enrollment}} course {{options are}} available in the District throughout the school year in areas such as Music, Art, Psychology, Anthropology, Algebra, Calculus, <b>Microeconomics,</b> Spanish, French, History, and Political Science. ASD partners with Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), Butler County Community College (BC3) and California University of Pennsylvania (Cal U) to offer these courses. The course costs are deeply discounted up to 75% off.|$|E
25|$|In <b>microeconomics,</b> diseconomies {{of scale}} are the cost {{disadvantages}} that firms and governments accrue due {{to increase in}} firm size or output, resulting in production {{of goods and services}} at increased per-unit costs. This typically follows the law of diminishing returns, where further increase in size of output will result in even greater increase in average cost. This concept is the opposite of economies of scale.|$|E
25|$|Prices and {{quantities}} {{have been}} described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a market economy. The theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed. In <b>microeconomics,</b> it applies to price and output determination for a market with perfect competition, which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting power.|$|E
25|$|Candidates for CAS and SOA {{membership}} {{must pass}} standardized tests in introductory economics and corporate finance. Candidates for SOA membership must pass an additional standardized test in applied statistics. Economics has two components: macroeconomics and <b>microeconomics.</b> Applied statistics has two components: regression and time series. Instead of passing exams, candidates may earn credit by passing an approved college {{class with a}} B- or better grade or by completing an approved correspondence class.|$|E
25|$|In <b>micro{{economic}}s,</b> {{supply and}} demand is an economic model of price determination in a market. It postulates that in a competitive market, the unit price for a particular good, or other traded item such as labor or liquid financial assets, will vary until it settles {{at a point where}} the quantity demanded (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied (at the current price), resulting in an economic equilibrium for price and quantity transacted.|$|E
25|$|Simon {{has been}} {{credited}} for revolutionary changes in <b>microeconomics.</b> He {{is responsible for}} the concept of organizational decision-making as it is known today. He also was the first to discuss this concept in terms of uncertainty; i.e. it is impossible to have perfect and complete information at any given time to make a decision. While this notion was not entirely new, Simon is best known for its origination. It was in this area that he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1978.|$|E
25|$|Public finance is {{the field}} of {{economics}} that deals with budgeting the revenues and expenditures of a public sector entity, usually government. The subject addresses such matters as tax incidence (who really pays a particular tax), cost-benefit analysis of government programmes, effects on economic efficiency and income distribution {{of different kinds of}} spending and taxes, and fiscal politics. The latter, an aspect of public choice theory, models public-sector behaviour analogously to <b>microeconomics,</b> involving interactions of self-interested voters, politicians, and bureaucrats.|$|E
25|$|During the {{classical}} period of economics, <b>microeconomics</b> was {{closely linked to}} psychology. For example, Adam Smith wrote The Theory of Moral Sentiments, which proposed psychological explanations of individual behavior, including concerns about fairness and justice, and Jeremy Bentham wrote extensively on the psychological underpinnings of utility. However, during the development of neo-classical economics economists sought to reshape the discipline as a natural science, deducing economic behavior from assumptions {{about the nature of}} economic agents. They developed the concept of homo economicus, whose psychology was fundamentally rational.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} {{developments}} were {{against the backdrop of}} improvements in both econometrics, that is the ability to measure prices and changes in goods and services, as well as their aggregate quantities, and in the creation of macroeconomics, or the study of whole economies. The attempt to combine neo-classical <b>microeconomics</b> and Keynesian macroeconomics would lead to the neoclassical synthesis which has been the dominant paradigm of economic reasoning in English-speaking countries since the 1950s. Hicks and Samuelson were for example instrumental in mainstreaming Keynesian economics.|$|E
25|$|With {{the help}} of Mises, in the late 1920s Hayek founded and served as {{director}} of the Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research, before joining the faculty of the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1931 at the behest of Lionel Robbins. Upon his arrival in London, Hayek was quickly recognised as one of the leading economic theorists in the world, and his development of the economics of processes in time and the co-ordination function of prices inspired the ground-breaking work of John Hicks, Abba Lerner, and many others in the development of modern <b>microeconomics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Economics is {{a social}} science which studies the production, distribution, trade, and {{consumption}} of goods and services. Economics focuses on measurable variables, and is broadly divided into two main branches: <b>microeconomics,</b> which deals with individual agents, such as households and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers {{the economy as a}} whole, in which case it considers aggregate supply and demand for money, capital and commodities. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are resource allocation, production, distribution, trade, and competition. Economic logic is increasingly applied to any problem that involves choice under scarcity or determining economic value.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, John Maynard Keynes {{prompted}} a division between <b>microeconomics</b> and macroeconomics. Under Keynesian economics macroeconomic trends can overwhelm economic choices made by individuals. Governments should promote aggregate demand for goods {{as a means}} to encourage economic expansion. Following World War II, Milton Friedman created the concept of monetarism. Monetarism focuses on using the supply and demand of money as a method for controlling economic activity. In the 1970s, monetarism has adapted into supply-side economics which advocates reducing taxes {{as a means to}} increase the amount of money available for economic expansion.|$|E
25|$|In <b>microeconomics,</b> the Bertrandâ€“Edgeworth {{model of}} price-setting {{oligopoly}} looks at {{what happens when}} there is a homogeneous product (i.e. consumers want to buy from the cheapest seller) where {{there is a limit to}} the output of firms which they are willing and able to sell at a particular price. This differs from the Bertrand competition model where it is assumed that firms are willing and able to meet all demand. The limit to output can be considered as a physical capacity constraint which is the same at all prices (as in Edgeworthâ€™s work), or to vary with price under other assumptions.|$|E
25|$|In <b>microeconomics,</b> {{the utility}} {{maximization}} problem and its dual problem, the expenditure minimization problem, are economic optimization problems. Insofar as they behave consistently, consumers {{are assumed to}} maximize their utility, while firms are usually assumed to maximize their profit. Also, agents are often modeled as being risk-averse, thereby preferring to avoid risk. Asset prices are also modeled using optimization theory, though the underlying mathematics relies on optimizing stochastic processes rather than on static optimization. International trade theory also uses optimization to explain trade patterns between nations. The optimization of portfolios {{is an example of}} multi-objective optimization in economics.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to making numerous influential contributions to <b>microeconomics,</b> Stiglitz {{has played a}} number of policy roles. He served in the Clinton administration as {{the chair of the}} President's Council of Economic Advisers (1995â€“1997). At the World Bank, he served as senior vice-president and chief economist (1997â€“2000), in the time when unprecedented protest against international economic organizations started, most prominently with the Seattle WTO meeting of 1999. He was fired by the World Bank for expressing dissent with its policies. He was a lead author of the 1995 Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Marshall's idea {{of solving}} the {{controversy}} was that the demand curve could be derived by aggregating individual consumer demand curves, which were themselves based on the consumer problem of maximizing utility. The supply curve could be derived by superimposing a representative firm supply curves for the factors of production and then market equilibrium would be given by the intersection of demand and supply curves. He also introduced the notion of different market periods: mainly Long run and short run. This set of ideas gave way to what economists call perfect competition, now found in the standard <b>microeconomics</b> texts, even though Marshall himself was highly skeptical {{it could be used}} as general model of all markets.|$|E
