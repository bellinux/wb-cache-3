5|$|Football on the Pacific Coast {{had been}} on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> change. Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be better on the Pacific coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the Pacific coast would be much better for a man of my age and in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E
25|$|Wight passed 1,000 runs in {{a season}} {{for the first of}} ten {{successive}} years during 1954; his first full season with the county, totalling 1,343 runs in 50 first-class innings. The following year he made his maiden County Championship century, with 106 in the first innings of a nine wicket victory over Worcestershire. The next three seasons proceeded in a similar fashion, with Wight scoring runs with an average fluctuating between the high twenties and low thirties, failing to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> scores needed to boost it further.|$|E

His college coach, Rod Rust, said of Greene: [...] "There are two factors behind Joe's success. First, {{he has the ability}} to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> defensive play and turn the tempo of a game around. Second, he has the speed to be an excellent pursuit player." [...] A pro scout said, [...] "He's tough and mean and comes to hit people. He has good killer instincts. He's mobile and hostile." ...|$|E

[...] Edna Gundersen of USA Today said in 2002, [...] "the alien territory of Achtung Baby and Zooropa cemented U2's relevance and enhanced its cachet as intrepid explorers".

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the rapid-fire dialogue, storylines on Gilmore Girls move slowly. Sherman-Palladino's motto was [...] "make the small big, <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> small", which she learned from her days writing for Roseanne. She chose to be [...] "very stingy with events", and the drama is low-key because [...] "sometimes the average every day things are more impactful". Key incidents often take place off-screen and are only revealed through character conversations, which journalist Constance Grady says is because [...] "On Gilmore Girls, the explosion is never what matters: It’s the fallout." [...] The show similarly uses subtext rather than exposition, [...] "where people will talk {{a great deal in}} order to obscure what they really mean to say". The writers did not like moments to be overly sentimental, preferring characters to show love through actions and behavior. Sherman-Palladino stated that the network did not interfere or request changes, though there is speculation that she delivered scripts at the last minute to avoid their input.|$|E

[...] Fitzpatrick noted that the demand was so great that a Michigan athlete could command $400 to $500 more a year in salary than students from other schools, and an All-Western player from Michigan's football team could command a salary of $1,500 for three months' work. [...] In what one newspaper called [...] "Fitzpatrick's call to the book worms", Fitzpatrick extended an offer even to students without the ability to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> teams that he would [...] "teach them all the tricks by which they can show other men to success on the cinder path and gridiron." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1963 {{model was}} {{essentially}} unchanged save for some freshening and added trim; windshields were reshaped and a four-door hardtop 500/XL was added. A lower, fastback roofline was added mid-year to improve looks and <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> cars more competitive on the NASCAR tracks {{with the added}} downforce. This 1963½ model, the industry's first official [...] "½ year" [...] model, was called the [...] "sports hardtop" [...] or [...] "fastback" [...] (it shared this feature with the for 1963½ Falcon).

The sports hardtop was available in both Galaxie 500, and Galaxie 500/XL trim. Mercury also received the new roofline (under the Marauder badge) in Monterey, Montclair, and Park Lane models.
