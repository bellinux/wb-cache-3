2500|$|Early in {{the life}} of the Viscount {{aircraft}} type, renewal of the inner lower booms included installation of new <b>mount</b> <b>fittings</b> for attachment of the rear of the two inboard engine nacelles to the lower booms. [...] New fittings were supplied without pre-drilled holes and the holes were drilled during installation to correctly align the engine nacelle with the wing. However, after considerable in-service experience of the boom-renewal process British Aircraft Corporation amended the procedure to allow re-use of the engine nacelle rear <b>mount</b> <b>fittings.</b> Re-use of the old fittings relied on the existing holes aligning closely with the bushes in the new inner lower booms. [...] When new inner lower booms were installed in VH-RMQ in 1958, new engine nacelle rear <b>mount</b> <b>fittings</b> were also installed but when new booms were again installed in 1964 the fittings first installed in 1958 were re-used. [...] In the wreckage of the right wing of VH-RMQ there was evidence of an initial problem while trying to align the five holes in the old fitting with the bushes in the new boom. The bores of three bushes had been scored with a drill, possibly while maintenance personnel were trying to align three of the holes sufficiently to be able to insert the attachment bolts. Running a drill through the bush at Station 143 may have disturbed the bush and initiated a sequence of actions leading to fatal damage to the wall of the hole.|$|R

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{prediction of}} pressure losses across in-duct fittings is of significance {{in relation to}} the accurate sizing and good energy efficiency of air-delivery systems. Current design guides provide design methods and data for the prediction of pressure losses only for a single and isolated fitting. This study presents an investigation of pressure losses across multiple interactive in-duct fittings in a ventilation duct. A laboratory measurement of pressure losses across one fitting and multiple fittings in a ventilation duct is carried out. The pressure loss across multiple interactive fittings is lower than that across multiple similar individual fittings, while the percentage decrease is dependent on the configuration and combination of the fittings. This implies that the pressure loss across multiple closely <b>mounted</b> <b>fittings</b> calculated by summing the pressure losses across individual fittings, as provided in the ASHRAE handbook and the CIBSE guide, is overpredicted. The numerical prediction of the pressure losses across multiple fittings using the large-eddy simulation (LES) model shows good agreement with the measured data, suggesting that this model is a useful tool in ductwork design and can help to save experimental resources and improve experimental accuracy and reliability.

5000|$|Isaac Newton {{built his}} {{reflecting}} telescope as a proof for his theory that white light {{is composed of}} a spectrum of colours. He had concluded that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). The telescope he constructed used mirrors as the objective which bypass that problem. To create the primary mirror Newton used a custom composition of metal consisting of six parts copper to two parts tin, an early composition of speculum metal. He devised means for shaping and grinding the mirror {{and may have been}} the first to use a pitch lap to polish the optical surface. He chose a spherical shape for his mirror instead of a parabola to simplify construction: he had satisfied himself that the chromatic, and not the spherical aberration, formed the chief faults of refracting telescopes. He added to his reflector what is the hallmark of the design of a [...] "Newtonian telescope", a secondary [...] "diagonal" [...] mirror near the primary mirror's focus to reflect the image at 90° angle to an eyepiece mounted {{on the side of the}} telescope. This unique addition allowed the image to be viewed with minimal obstruction of the objective mirror. He also made all the tube, <b>mount,</b> and <b>fittings.</b>|$|R
50|$|In late 1668 Isaac Newton {{built his}} first {{reflecting}} telescope. He chose an alloy (speculum metal) of tin and copper {{as the most}} suitable material for his objective mirror. He later devised means for shaping and grinding the mirror {{and may have been}} the first to use a pitch lap to polish the optical surface. He chose a spherical shape for his mirror instead of a parabola to simplify construction; even though it would introduce spherical aberration, it would still correct chromatic aberration. He added to his reflector what is the hallmark of the design of a Newtonian telescope, a secondary diagonally mounted mirror near the primary mirror's focus to reflect the image at a 90° angle to an eyepiece mounted {{on the side of the}} telescope. This unique addition allowed the image to be viewed with minimal obstruction of the objective mirror. He also made the tube, <b>mount,</b> and <b>fittings.</b> Newton's first version had a primary mirror diameter of 1.3 in and a focal ratio of f/5. He found that the telescope worked without colour distortion and that he could see the four Galilean moons of Jupiter and the crescent phase of the planet Venus with it. Newton's friend Isaac Barrow showed a second telescope to a small group from the Royal Society of London at the end of 1671. They were so impressed with it that they demonstrated it to Charles II in January 1672. Newton was admitted as a fellow of the society in the same year.|$|R
2500|$|In 1666 Isaac Newton, {{based on}} his {{theories}} of refraction and color, perceived that the faults of the refracting telescope were due more to a lens's varying refraction of light of different colors than to a lens's imperfect shape. He concluded that light could not be refracted through a lens without causing chromatic aberrations, although he incorrectly concluded from some rough experiments that all refracting substances would diverge the prismatic colors in a constant proportion to their mean refraction. From these experiments Newton concluded that no improvement could {{be made in the}} refracting telescope. Newton's experiments with mirrors showed that they did not suffer from the chromatic errors of lenses, for all colors of light the angle of incidence reflected in a mirror was equal to the angle of reflection, so as a proof to his theories Newton set out to build a reflecting telescope. Newton completed his first telescope in 1668 and it is the earliest known functional reflecting telescope. [...] After much experiment, he chose an alloy (speculum metal) of tin and copper as the most suitable material for his objective [...] mirror. He later devised means for grinding and polishing them, but chose a spherical shape for his mirror instead of a parabola to simplify construction. He added to his reflector what is the hallmark of the design of a [...] "Newtonian telescope", a secondary [...] "diagonal" [...] mirror near the primary mirror's focus to reflect the image at 90° angle to an eyepiece mounted {{on the side of the}} telescope.

With it he found that he could see the four Galilean moons of Jupiter and the crescent phase of the planet Venus. Encouraged by this success, he made a second telescope with a magnifying power of 38x which he presented to the Royal Society of London in December 1672. This type of telescope is still called a Newtonian telescope.|$|R
40|$|Virtual {{prototyping}} (VP) {{of complex}} machines requires the realistic representation of components to perform robust analyses and simulations. In many cases, machines are an assembly of rigid and flexible components. Although modern three-dimensional CAD {{systems can be}} considered powerful tools for modelling solids or surfaces representing rigid bodies, they are not adequate to model soft material components, especially a realistic visualisation of physical behaviour. This drawback motivated the present research work. In particular, this paper describes an approach and the related knowledge-based software system (FlexSim) developed to create virtual prototypes facilitating product development in cases of flexible parts like cables, pipes and wires. The resulting VP tool integrates the CAD technology and the dedicated structural simulation methods to automatically model and validate three-dimensional functional sub-groups having flexible parts. The system application is shown on metallic reinforced elastomer hoses used for hydraulic power transmissions. For this purpose, a finite-element approach has been implemented to find hose configurations for given boundary conditions determined by <b>mounting</b> positions. Pipe <b>fittings</b> are selected and automatically assembled and the optimal hose length and its ideal spatial disposition are calculated. Simulations of behaviour allow the rapid optimisation of a solution. The system has been tested on agricultural harvest machines and mining equipment, which widely employ hydraulic transmissions for moving groups of components. As a result, the number of physical prototypes, the lead-time due to the trial-and-error activities and the product development costs can be significantly reduced...|$|R
40|$|LectureThe present paper {{describes}} the test activities which have validated a new compressor architecture, {{developed by the}} OEM, which is able to deliver a higher pressure ratio in a single casing with respect to traditional configurations. The major differences {{with respect to the}} typical technologies used for high pressure machines are in the rotor design: Rotor stacked configuration with impellers connected through high precision toothed joint and a pre-stretched tie-rod; Shrouded and unshrouded impellers on a multistage between-bearings compressor; High peripheral speed journal and thrust bearings. The combination of unshrouded and shrouded impellers allows achieving same pressure ratio in a shorter bearing span, giving the possibility {{to increase the number of}} sections for each unit, making possible to reduce the number of casings. A full scale prototype has been built and tested to validate the new machine architecture. The prototype has been designed to fulfill a compression service made of three compression sections with a single unit; the same service could only be performed with at least two units if a standard compressor design was applied. The service requires serial compression of natural gas, characterized as follows: Design inlet volumetric flow close to 10800 m 3 /h; Design pressure ratio close to 30; Absorbed power~ 14 MW; Design speed of 17619 RPM (MCS = 18500 RPM, mos = 14095 RPM); First section comprises 2 open impellers; second section comprises 3 closed impellers and third section has 2 closed impellers. Impellers for first and second sections are in stacked configuration; third section?s impellers are <b>mounted</b> through shrink <b>fitting.</b> Considering the increased speed requirement, the prototype has been tested in conjunction with an epicyclic gear, which allows for improved efficiency for high gear ratio (12. 34 in this case) with respect to standard parallel axes gears...|$|R
