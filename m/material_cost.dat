5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, {{the cost of}} welding {{plays a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, <b>material</b> <b>cost,</b> and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The cost of materials includes the cost of the base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E

25|$|The {{depth of}} a truss, or the height between {{the upper and}} lower chords, is what makes it an {{efficient}} structural form. A solid girder or beam of equal strength would have substantial weight and <b>material</b> <b>cost</b> as compared to a truss. For a given span, a deeper truss will require less material in the chords and greater material in the verticals and diagonals. An optimum depth of the truss will maximize the efficiency.|$|E

This diagram is an extension of the analyses of cost accounting, Nicholson presented in 1909. This type of visual analytics was presented earlier by Church (1901), and became more common in introductory textbooks; see for example Webner (1911), Kimball (1914), Larson (1916), and Newlove (1923).|$|E

This research was used secondary data from the years 2000 - 2013, published by the Badan Pusat Statistik Indonesia. The analytical method used multiple linear regression analysis, the beta coefficient test and elasticity test with SPSS 21. The results of this research showed simultaneous raw <b>materials</b> <b>cost,</b> fuel cost and capital cost affect the value-added of tobacco processing industry in Indonesia. Partially fuel cost has no {{significant effect on the}} value-added of tobacco processing industry, while raw <b>materials</b> <b>cost</b> and capital cost significantly influence the value-added processing of the tobacco industry.

Between 27 and 30% of soldiers conscripted from 1912–1915 were killed.

25|$|The {{hardness}} (8–8.5), RI (2.15–2.18, isotropic), dispersion (0.058–0.066), and low <b>material</b> <b>cost</b> make CZ {{the most}} popular simulant of diamond. Its optical and physical constants are however variable, owing to the different stabilizers used by different producers. There are many formulations of stabilized cubic zirconia. These variations change the physical and optical properties markedly. While the visual likeness of CZ is close enough to diamond to fool most who do not handle diamond regularly, CZ will usually give certain clues. For example: it is somewhat brittle and is soft enough to possess scratches after normal use in jewelry; it is usually internally flawless and completely colorless (whereas most diamonds have some internal imperfections and a yellow tint); its SG (5.6–6) is high; and its reaction under ultraviolet light is a distinctive beige. Most jewelers will use a thermal probe to test all suspected CZs, a test which relies on diamond's superlative thermal conductivity (CZ, like almost all other diamond simulants, is a thermal insulator). CZ is made {{in a number of}} different colors meant to imitate fancy diamonds (e.g., yellow to golden brown, orange, red to pink, green, and opaque black), but most of these do not approximate the real thing. Cubic zirconia can be coated with diamond-like carbon to improve its durability, but will still be detected as CZ by a thermal probe.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{there is}} a small niche market for hemp pulp, for example as {{cigarette}} paper. Hemp fiber is mixed with fiber from other sources than hemp. In 1994 there was no significant production of 100% true hemp paper. World hemp pulp production was believed to be around 120,000 tons per year in 1991 which was about 0.05% of the world's annual pulp production volume. The total world production of hemp fiber had in 2003 declined to about 60,000 from 80,000 tons. This can be compared to a typical pulp mill for wood fiber, which is never smaller than 250,000 tons per annum. The cost of hemp pulp is approximately six times that of wood pulp, mostly because of the small size and outdated equipment of the few hemp processing plants in the Western world, and because hemp is harvested once a year (during August) and needs to be stored to feed the mill the whole year through. This storage requires a lot of (mostly manual) handling of the bulky stalk bundles. Another issue is that the entire hemp plant cannot be economically prepared for paper production. While the wood products industry uses nearly 100% of the fiber from harvested trees, only about 25% of the dried hemp stem—the bark, called bast—contains the long, strong fibers desirable for paper production. All this accounts for a high raw <b>material</b> <b>cost.</b> Hemp pulp is bleached with hydrogen peroxide, a process today also commonly used for wood pulp.|$|E
