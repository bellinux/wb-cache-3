Resistance to herbicides diclofop, <b>mesosulfuron,</b> and pinoxaden among ryegrass populations has been reported. Glyphosate-resistant Italian ryegrass populations were identified in Desha County, Arkansas. This research aimed to 1) determine resistance patterns to ACCase (diclofop and pinoxaden) and ALS (imazamox, <b>mesosulfuron,</b> and pyroxsulam) herbicides among Italian ryegrass populations from the southern US; 2) determine if cytochrome P 450 -mediated enhanced herbicide metabolism contributed to resistance; and 3) elucidate the resistance mechanism to glyphosate in four Arkansas populations (Des 03, Des 05, Des 14, and D 8). For objective 1, 30 accessions from problematic fields in the southern US between 2008 and 2010 were subjected to dose-response bioassays. Among the 30 accessions, 27 were resistant to both diclofop and <b>mesosulfuron,</b> 25 of which were also resistant to pyroxsulam. Ten Arkansas accessions collected in 2008 were resistant to diclofop, <b>mesosulfuron,</b> pyroxsulam, and imazamox. One accession from Georgia and three accessions from North Carolina were resistant to diclofop, <b>mesosulfuron,</b> pyroxsulam, and pinoxaden. For objective 2, six ryegrass populations with different resistance patterns to glyphosate, ALS- and ACCase herbicides, were treated with P 450 inhibitors malathion (1000 g ai ha- 1) and 1 -aminobenzotriazole (100 µM ABT) before herbicide application. Malathion improved herbicide activity in some populations; but did not completely overcome resistance to any herbicide. This indicates that P 450 -mediated metabolism is only partially responsible for resistance in these populations. For objective 3, plants from Des 03 population were analyzed for resistance level, EPSPS genetic mutation(s), EPSPS enzyme activity, and EPSPS gene copy number. The absorption and translocation of 14 C-glyphosate were similar in R and S plants. The EPSPS gene in the R plants did not contain any point mutation(s) associated with glyphosate resistance. Resistance to glyphosate in Des 03 is due to increased basal EPSPS enzyme activity resulting from amplification of the EPSPS gene. Follow-up experiments conducted on other glyphosate-R populations Des 05, Des 14, and D 8 showed 11 -fold to 516 -fold more copies of the EPSPS gene in resistant plants than their susceptible counterparts indicating that EPSPS gene amplification also confers resistance to glyphosate in these populations...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of herbicide resistance {{is an important}} topic in plant protection and agricultural practice. Safeners are commonly used in herbicides to protect crops against herbicidal damage. Although {{no effect on the}} weed control is expected, it has been theorized that the rate of {{evolution of}} non-target site resistance (NTSR) in weeds in cereals may be enhanced by use of herbicide products containing safeners. One of the most important safeners in cereals is mefenpyr-diethyl. Therefore, the possible influence of mefenpyr on herbicide resistance was studied in cooperative trials between Bayer CropScience (BCS, F-Höchst) and FH Bingen. The trials tested in parallel different herbicide resistant black-grass (Alopecurus myosuroides (Huds.)) biotypes under greenhouse conditions. The biotypes where chosen due to known NTSR against Atlantis WG® (4 highly resistant and 5 moderately resistant) as well as two susceptible biotypes. The populations were treated with the following three herbicide/safener regimes in six concentrations adjusted according to the anticipated biotype resistance levels. (1) <b>mesosulfuron</b> + iodosulfuron + without safener formulation, (2) <b>mesosulfuron</b> + iodosulfuron + constant mefenpyr concentration (45 g/ha), (3) <b>mesosulfuron</b> + iodosulfuron + varying mefenpyr concentrations (ratio 5 : 1 : 15). The treatments were applied in post-emergence based on <b>mesosulfuron</b> to iodosulfuron ratios in Atlantis WG® (5 : 1). The trials were assessed visually (% effect) and by fresh weight. Dose-response curves were performed and ED 50 values for each treatment and biotype were calculated. Results showed a varying effect of safeners which was in the most cases negligible. Depending on the biotypes mostly no impact on the safener was found for herbicide resistance. In conclusion, the trials from Bingen and F-Höchst gave evidence, that there is no significant and consistent influence of the safener mefenpyr on evolution of NTSR black-grass...|$|E

In the first experiment, 10 treatments of herbicides applied to wheat at the year before planting, and after wheat harvesting, the maize crop was planted. Treatments consisted of Chevaliar (idosulfosulfuron + <b>mesosulfuron)</b> at 0. 4 L/ha, Apyrus (sulfosulfuron) at 28, 42, 56 and 68 g/ha, megaton (chlorsulfuron) at 20 g/ha, bromicide + topic ("bromoxynil + MCPA"+ clodinafop-propargyl) at 1. 5 + 0. 8 L/ha, Total (sulfosulfuron +mesosulfuron) at 45 g/ha, atlantis (idosulfuron + <b>mesosulfuron)</b> at 1. 5 L/ha and non-treated control.

The purpose {{of this research was}} to screen selected putative resistant populations of Italian ryegrass for resistance to the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) -inhibiting herbicides diclofop and pinoxaden and the acetolactate synthase (ALS) -inhibiting herbicides imazamox, pyroxsulam, and <b>mesosulfuron</b> in the greenhouse and to use field experiments to develop herbicide programs for Italian ryegrass control. Resistance to diclofop was confirmed in eight populations from Tennessee. These eight populations did not show cross-resistance to pinoxaden. One additional population (R 1) from Union County, North Carolina, was found to be resistant to both diclofop and pinoxaden. The level of resistance to pinoxaden of the R 1 population was 15 times that of the susceptible population. No resistance was confirmed to any of the ALS-inhibiting herbicides examined in this research. Field experiments demonstrated PRE Italian ryegrass control with chlorsulfuron (71 to 94 %) and flufenacet + metribuzin (84 to 96 %). Italian ryegrass control with pendimethalin applied PRE or delayed preemergence (DPRE) was variable (0 to 85 %). POST control of Italian ryegrass was acceptable with pinoxaden, <b>mesosulfuron,</b> flufenacet + metribuzin, and chlorsulfuron + flucarbazone (> 80 %).

40|$|Abstract Two {{separate}} greenhouse {{experiments were}} conducted in the greenhouse facilities of the Iranian Plant Protection Research Institute, Tehran, to study the efficacy of some herbicides to control of resistant and susceptible P. minor and P. paradoxa biotypes. In each experiment, resistant and susceptible biotypes were treated separately by 19 herbicide treatments. Treatments included 10 ACCase inhibitors, 6 Acetolactate Synthase (ALS) inhibitors, prosulfocarb, flamprop-M-isopropyl, isoproturon plus diflufenican and a non-sprayed control. To evaluate the effects of treatments, different characteristics including percent damage based on EWRC scores at 15 and 30 days after spraying, percentage of survived plants after spraying relative to before spraying, and percentage of dry weight and wet weight of individual plants relative to control were studied. Results showed that the susceptible biotypes of P. minor were best controlled by clodinafop propargyl and pinoxaden at 450 ml/ha while pinoxaden at 450 ml/ha and cycloxydim were best options {{for control of the}} resistant biotype. Among ALS inhibitors, iodosulfuron plus <b>mesosulfuron</b> could control susceptible and resistant biotypes of P. minor very effectively and semi-satisfactory, respectively.

An {{understanding of the}} effect of growth stage on herbicide tolerance of wheat and control of P. minor will help in selecting the most appropriate herbicide for different situations. The weed control and crop safety of four commonly used wheat herbicides (sulfosulfuron, pinoxaden, fenoxaprop plus metribuzin and <b>mesosulfuron</b> plus iodosulfuron), each applied at four different wheat growth stages was investigated in field studies for two years. P. minor plants were at 1, 2 - 3, 3 - 4 and 7 - 8 leaf stages when the herbicides were applied at Zadok 12 -Z 12, Z 13, Z 21 and Z 23 stages of wheat, respectively. Sulfosulfuron application at Z 12 and Z 13 wheat stages (before first irrigation), provided > 80 % control of P. minor and produced wheat grain yield (4. 5 - 4. 7 t/ha) similar to the weed-free check (4. 9 t/ha) in both years. Pinoxaden, fenoxaprop plus metribuzin and <b>mesosulfuron</b> plus iodosulfuron application at Z 12 and Z 13 wheat stages recorded significantly lower wheat grain yield (3. 62 - 3. 95 t/ha) due to poor weed control, crop toxicity or both.

40|$|Herbicides are {{currently}} pivotal to control weeds and sustain food security. Herbicides must efficiently kill weeds while being as harmless {{as possible for}} crops, even crops taxonomically close to weeds. To increase their selectivity toward crops, some herbicides are sprayed in association with safeners that are bioactive compounds exacerbating herbicide-degrading pathways reputedly specifically in crops. However, exacerbated herbicide metabolism is also a key mechanism underlying evolved non-target-site-based resistance to herbicides (NTSR) in weeds. This {{raised the issue of}} a possible role of safeners on NTSR evolution in weeds. We investigated a possible effect of the respective field rates of the two broadly used safeners cloquintocet-mexyl and mefenpyr-diethyl on the sensitivity of the troublesome global weed Lolium sp. (rye-grass) to the major herbicides inhibiting acetolactate-synthase (ALS) pyroxsulam and iodosulfuron + <b>mesosulfuron,</b> respectively. Three Lolium sp. populations were studied in three series of experiments. The first experiment series compared the frequencies of plants surviving application of each herbicide alone or in association with its safener. Safener co-application caused a net increase ranging from 5. 0 to 46. 5 % in the frequency of plants surviving the field rate of their associated herbicide. In a second series of experiments, safener effect was assessed on individual plant sensitivity using vegetative propagation. A reduction in sensitivity to pyroxsulam and to iodosulfuron + <b>mesosulfuron</b> was observed for 44. 4 and 11. 1 % of the plants in co-treatment with cloquintocet-mexyl and mefenpyr-diethyl, respectively. A third series of experiments investigated safener effect on the expression level of 19 Lolium sp. NTSR marker genes. Safeners showed an enhancing effect on the expression level of 10 genes. Overall, we demonstrated that cloquintocet-mexyl and mefenpyr-diethyl both reduced the sensitivity of Lolium sp. to their associated ALS-inhibiting herbicide and most likely exacerbated herbicide-degrading secondary metabolism pathways. This suggests that genetic variation for safener response is present in Lolium sp. Thus, a possible, uninvestigated way to NTSR evolution could be selection for increased responsiveness to safener action. Delivering safeners exclusively to the crop could mitigate the risk for NTSR evolution in weeds...|$|E

First of all, a bare silica capillary was chosen with 10 mM of 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoro-borate (bminBF 4) as electrophoretic buffer (pH 9. 6) containing 2 mg L− 1 of surfactant-coated single-wallcarbon nanotubes (SC-SWCNTs). A dramatic deviation in migration times was observed. Therefore, apoly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride (PDADMAC) statically coated cationic capillary was used toimprove repeatability and to alter the selectivity of the separation. The electroosmotic flow (EOF) mea-surement revealed that the SC-SWCNTs were strongly adsorbed at the surface of the PDADMAC coatingeven in the absence of the surfactant-coated nanotubes in the electrolyte buffer. Consequently, a stablestrong cathodic EOF and excellent repeatabilities were obtained with relative standard deviations (RSDs) on migration times and on corrected peak areas below 0. 9 and 1. 5 %, respectively.

In total, 73 canarygrass accessions were collected and screened in a field experiment with several herbicides commonly used to control this weed. Most of the weed populations were classed as resistant (or developing resistance) to the acetyl-CoA varboxylase (ACCase) -inhibiting herbicide diclofop, while resistance to clodinafop was markedly lower. The results of the pot experiments showed {{that some of the}} canary populations were found to have a very high level of diclofop resistance (resistance index up to 12. 4), while cross resistance with other herbicides was also com-mon. The levels of resistance and cross resistance patterns among populations varied along with the different amounts and times of selection pressure. Such variation indicated either more than one mechanism of resistance or different resistance mutations in these weed populations. The population which had the highest diclofop resistance level, showed resistance to all aryloxyphenoxypropinate (APP) herbicides applied and non-ACCase inhibitors. Alternative ACCase-inhibiting herbicides, such as pinoxaden remain effective on the majority of the tested canarygrass populations, while the acetolactate synthase (ALS) -inhibiting herbicide <b>mesosulfuron</b> + iodosulfuron could also provide some solutions.

Therefore, farmers started to spray herbicide intensively and soon cases of failure occurred for different molecules and different modes of action. Black-grass populations have been tested in greenhouses to assess the influence of an herbicide treatment as to the resistance level regarding three different herbicides: chlortoluron, fenoxaprop-P and mesosulfuron+iodosulfuron. Black-grass seeds were collected in field trials in six locations in Belgium, on individuals which have survived the herbicide treatment. Each population comes from trial plots, measuring 2 meters wide by 5 meters long and characterized by a single or a combination of products. Herbicides sprayed were isoproturon, flufenacet+diflufenican, ACCase inhibitors and ALS inhibitors. Seeds were also collected in the untreated plots. The population present in these last ones corresponds to the former population, before the herbicide selection pressure was applied. In the glasshouse assay, this population was used as the standard population to compare with other populations issued from the same field. The 'R' rating system was set up with this population to assess the evolution of resistance level, year in, year out. Rothamsted and Peldon populations were also included as cross-reference. Each field population presented different behaviours towards herbicide applied in greenhouses and some cases of resistance can be highlighted. Generally, a reduction of treatment efficiency between field and greenhouse results was clearly visible for the whole of studied active ingredients. Indeed, a distribution shift of the populations towards higher resistance classes could be observed. This is particularly remarkable for active ingredients sharing the same mode of action.

The fall results in both seasons of the experiment (2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011) were consistent. This was also confirmed for the efficacy results for foliar herbicides in spring. Subject to field history, there was a wide range in sensitivity to the tested herbicides. Black-grass populations from coastal regions were poorly controlled by FOCUS ULTRA® (cycloxydim) or SELECT 240 EC® (clethodim) + PARA SOMMER® (paraffin oil), but were highly susceptible to MOTIVELL® (nicosulfuron). Contrary results were observed with reference to the blackgrass populations from the inland. These populations were derived from fields where the crop rotation contains of 66 % cereals and 33 % maize. The populations from the coast were sampled in crop rotations dominated by cereals or cereals followed by oil seed rape. Poor efficacy of ATLANTIS OD® (<b>mesosulfuron</b> + iodosulfuron) was observed in black-grass populations from the coastal regions as well as from the inland...|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{control of}} Alopecurus myosuroides (ALOMY) {{depends on the}} application date, the product selection and the dose rate and is also influenced by the correct application technology. Small and large plot trials were conducted at locations with heavy ALOMY infestation in the years 2004 - 2010. Atlantis WG (<b>mesosulfuron</b> & iodosulfuron) with different water dose rates, nozzle types and {{at different times of}} day was applied to control ALOMY in winter wheat. The droplet size as well as the water rate had the strongest impact on ALOMY control, while the application speed played a rather subordinated role. The applications with very coarse droplets (90 % drift-reducing potential) lead to efficacy reductions. This becomes particularly visible with applications in the early growth stages of ALOMY. Coarse drops roll off faster. On the other hand, applications with fine or medium droplets tend to result in a better control but they can lead to drift at high wind velocities and evaporation at high air temperatures and therefore cause lower efficacy. There was no visible difference between the types of the tested nozzle tips like standard flat jet, compact injector nozzle and double flat spray nozzle. The herbicidal efficacy was clearly affected by the moisture of the weed leaves. With moist leaf surfaces, the risk of run-off effects exists. This was more expressed with high spray volumes (250 l/ha) and has to be considered at early day or night applications. In situations of moist leaves, the spray volumes can be reduced to 100 - 150 l/ha. It is recommended to use the 90 % drift reducing nozzles only in the sensitive field bark area and to secure the efficacy of Atlantis WG against ALOMY by adjusting the pressure, the driving speed or by changing the nozzles outside of this sensitive area. From these test results, the following nozzle recommendation is concluded: Compact injector nozzles like AIXR, Air-mix, IDK should be used with a caliber of 03 or 04 at about 3 bar. Hereby the registration related buffer zone distances have to be considered...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} {{the most commonly used}} agricultural pesticides around Ichkeul Lake–Bizerta Lagoon watershed. First survey of pesticide use on agricultural watershed was performed with farmers, Regional Commissioner for Agricultural Development, and pesticide dealers. Then, sediment contamination by pesticides and response of benthic communities (bacteria and free-living marine nematode) were investigated. The analysis of 22 active organochlorine pesticides in sediments was performed according to quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method, biodiversity of indigenous bacterial community sediment was determined by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), and free-living marine nematodes were counted. The results of the field survey showed that iodosulfuron, <b>mesosulfuron,</b> 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 D), glyphosate, and fenoxaprops were the most used herbicides, tebuconazole and epoxiconazole the most used fungicides, and deltamethrin the most used insecticide. Sixteen organochlorine pesticide compounds among the 22 examined were detected in sediments up to 2  ppm in Ichkeul Lake, endrin, dieldrin, and hexachlorocyclohexane being the most detected molecules. The most pesticide-contaminated site in the lake presented the higher density of nematode, but when considering all sites, no clear correlation with organochlorine pesticide (OCP) content could be established. The bacterial community structure in the most contaminated site in the lake was characterized by the terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) 97, 146, 258, 285, and 335 while the most contaminated site in the lagoon was characterized by the T-RFs 54, 263, 315, 403, and 428. Interestingly, T-RFs 38 and 143 were found in the most contaminated sites of both lake and lagoon ecosystems, indicating that they were resistant to OCPs and able to cope with environmental fluctuation of salinity. In contrast, the T-RFs 63, 100, 118, and 381 in the lake and the T-RFs 40, 60, 80, 158, 300, 321, and 357 in the lagoon were sensitive to OCPs. This study highlighted that the intensive use of pesticides in agriculture, through transfer to aquatic ecosystem, may disturb the benthic ecosystem functioning of the protected area. The free-living marine nematodes and bacterial communities represent useful proxy to follow the ecosystem health and its capacity of resilience...|$|E
