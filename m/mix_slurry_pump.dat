40|$|An {{assessment}} of the energetic requirements of slurry-phase accelerated carbonation for CO 2 sequestration using steelmaking slag was conducted. The results of dedicated lab-scale carbonation experiments in which the CO 2 sequestration yield of basic oxygen furnace slag was investigated at different operating conditions {{were used for the}} energy requirement calculations. The operating variables of the process and the associated values adopted were total gas pressure, temperature, and CO 2 concentration in the gas phase. The energy duties of the slurry-phase carbonation layout were calculated for the different unit operations, which included slag milling, <b>mixing,</b> <b>slurry</b> <b>pumping,</b> heating, CO 2 compression, solid/liquid separation, and CO 2 capture (when required). The estimated energy requirements were found to lie in the range 980 − 6300 MJ t− 1 CO 2 sequestered, where {{the lower end of the}} range was associated with the use of diluted CO 2. In all cases, the use of a concentrated CO 2 flow proved largely energetically unfavorable over the use of diluted gas streams, since the energy duty of the required CO 2 capture stage by far overcame the benefits associated with improved sequestration yields at increased CO 2 concentrations in the gas phase. The calculated energy requirements were also processed to derive a second-order model accounting for the main effects and interactions between the operating variables of the carbonation process. The model developed is meant to predict the expected energy demand of the carbonation process under different operating conditions and to define the optimal combination of these in terms of the energetic profile of the process itself. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

The program was begun in 1982 to improve the operating life of centrifugal <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps</b> for coal liquefaction service. The first phase reviewed pilot plant experience with centrifugal <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps</b> and identified, {{with the help of a}} literature search, the critical design parameters and materials required for such improvement. The second phase encompassed extensive small-scale testing of several hydraulic design concepts and materials testing and selection - the results being incorporated in a prototype <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> design. This third phase of the work has included i) prototype <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> testing against a state-of-the-art coal liquefaction <b>slurry</b> <b>pump,</b> wherein substantial reduction of wear was obtained at 60 % higher speed at the same head and flow rate therefore at 60 % higher specific speed - and ii) an investigation as to whether still higher specific speed is possible. The prototype pump tested in (i) had a specific speed of 600. Another pump of this same design was re-fitted for investigation (ii) with a smaller impeller and associated liners so as to operate at a specific speed of 1000. Both the 600 and the 1000 impellers for this latter investigation (ii) were made of mild carbon steel to accelerate the testing time. The two pumps were run in series in the slurry test loop using AS {number_sign} 110 sand ({approximately} 110 mesh) at a concentration of 30 % by weight in water at 80 {degrees}F. As previously reported, 24 hours of test time revealed a slightly lower overall wear rate for the 1000 -specific-speed pump; however, excessive local wear occurred in the impeller eye area of that pump. This was attributed to too large a clearance between the pump-out vanes and the suction side of the volute liner. Wear elsewhere in the pump was uniform and comparable to that of the 600 -specific-speed prototype pump. 3 figs., 2 tabs...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{recovering}} the waste in storage tanks at the Savannah River Site (SRS) typically requires mixing {{the contents of}} the tank to ensure uniformity of the discharge stream. Mixing is accomplished with one to four <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps</b> located within the tank liquid. The <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> may be fixed in position or they may rotate depending on the specific mixing requirements. The high-level waste in Tank 48 contains insoluble solids in the form of potassium tetraphenyl borate compounds (KTPB), monosodium titanate (MST), and sludge. Tank 48 is equipped with 4 <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps,</b> which are intended to suspend the insoluble solids prior to transfer of the waste to the Fluidized Bed Steam Reformer (FBSR) process. The FBSR process is being designed for a normal feed of 3. 05 wt% insoluble solids. A chemical characterization study has shown the insoluble solids concentration is approximately 3. 05 wt% when well-mixed. The project is requesting a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) mixing study from SRNL to determine the solids behavior with 2, 3, and 4 <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps</b> in operation and an estimate of the insoluble solids concentration at the suction of the transfer pump to the FBSR process. The impact of cooling coils is not considered in the current work. The work consists of two principal objectives by taking a CFD approach: (1) To estimate insoluble solids concentration transferred from Tank 48 to the Waste Feed Tank in the FBSR process and (2) To assess the impact of different combinations of four <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps</b> on insoluble solids suspension and mixing in Tank 48. For this work, several different combinations of a maximum of four pumps are considered to determine the resulting flow patterns and local flow velocities which are thought to be associated with sludge particle mixing. Two different elevations of pump nozzles are used for an assessment of the flow patterns on the tank mixing. Pump design and operating parameters used for the analysis are summarized in Table 1. The baseline pump orientations are chosen by the previous work [Lee et. al, 2008] and the initial engineering judgement for the conservative flow estimate since the modeling results for the other pump orientations are compared with the baseline results. As shown in Table 1, the present study assumes that each <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> has 900 gpm flowrate for the tank mixing analysis, although the Standard Operating Procedure for Tank 48 currently limits the actual pump speed and flowrate to a value less than 900 gpm for a 29 inch liquid level.

Savannah River Site (SRS) Liquid Waste moved both of the Quad Volute pumps from Tank 50 H to Tank 51 H to replace pumps in Tank 51 H that were failing.

SRS Liquid Waste requested Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to conduct a study to evaluate the feasibility of mixing the contents of Tank 50 H with one to three standard <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps.</b> To determine the pump requirements to mix solids with liquids in Tank 50 H, the author reviewed the pilot-scale blending work performed for the Small Column Ion Exchange Process (SCIX), SRNL computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, Tank 50 H operating experience, and the technical literature, and applied the results to Tank 50 H to determine the number, size, and operating parameters of pumps needed to mix the solid particles with the liquid in Tank 50 H. The analysis determined pump requirements to suspend the solids with no 'dead zones', but did not determine the pump requirements to produce a homogeneous suspension. In addition, the analysis determined the pump requirements to prevent the accumulation of {{a large amount of}} solid particles under the telescoping transfer pump. The conclusions from this analysis follow: (1) The analysis shows that three Quad Volute pumps should be able to suspend the solid particles expected ({approx} 0. 6 g/L insoluble solids, {approx} 5 micron) in Tank 50 H. (2) Three standard <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps</b> {{may not be able to}} suspend the solid particles in Tank 50 H; (3) The ability of two Quad Volute pumps to fully suspend all of the solid particles in Tank 50 H is marginal; and (4) One standard <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> should be able to achieve a cleaning radius larger than 43. 5 feet, which will prevent large amounts of solid particles from settling under the telescoping transfer pump (TTP).
