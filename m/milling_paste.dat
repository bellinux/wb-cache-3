40|$|During storage, {{the milling}} and {{physicochemical}} properties and eating quality of rice change, {{which is generally}} termed `aging 2 ̆ 7. Aged rice is preferred by processors, and there are attempts to develop accelerated aging process using various heat sources. In this study, the effects of various heat treatments and their influence on the <b>milling,</b> <b>pasting,</b> thermal, and cooking properties of two long-grain rice cultivars during storage were investigated using a full-factorial experimental design. Two long-grain rice cultivars, Wells and XP 723, was treated with 8 different heat treatments including one control and stored {{at room temperature for}} 180 days. Heat treatments included 2 levels of UV irradiation, 2 levels of autoclaving and 3 levels of convection oven. The heat treatments significantly influenced head rice yield and thermal properties. The surface lipid content and cooked rice hardness and stickiness were impacted by cultivars, heat treatments and storage with different extent showing 3 -way interactions. Severe autoclaving resulted in different protein composition from the other treatments. Peak pasting viscosity significantly increased at the first 3 months and gradually leveled off regardless of cultivar and heat treatments. Leached solid contents were decreased gradually during storage. Autoclaving (especially severe autoclaving) samples showed more distinct characteristics on HRY, leached solids and cooking properties. Although different heat treatments had different impacts on their properties, the results show that the various heat treatments employed in this study slightly accelerated rice aging by stabilizing rice properties during storage...|$|R

The milled alkaline starch pearls showed high cold paste viscosities and setback ratios while the acidic milled starch had low cold paste viscosities and setback ratios. Furthermore, in alkaline milled starch, the addition of sugar drastically lowered the setback ratios while the setback ratios of the milled acidic starches were minimally affected. From the laboratory preparation of starch pearls from commercial tuber starches (potato and cassava), {{it appeared that the}} process of pearling effected a mild starch modification which increased the stability ratio of the milled starch pearl compared to the unprocessed starch. © 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

40|$|Effects of kernel size on {{grain sorghum}} [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] quality were studied in an {{experiment}} designed to separate effects of kernel size from seedlot. The study utilized three sieve fractions of varying kernel diameter (3 ̆e 3. 35, 3 ̆e 2. 80 and 3 ̆e 2. 36 mm) from six seedlots. Chemical composition, physical characteristics, <b>milling</b> characteristics, <b>pasting</b> properties, and cooking qualities were determined for each kernel size fraction. Large kernels lost less relative mass during 1 min of decortication, were higher in protein concentration, and lower in ash. Milling yields were higher from large kernels, and flour from large kernels had higher water absorbance, brighter white color, and larger particle size. Kernel size effects on Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) properties were not consistent. These results suggest that within the sorghum seedlots studied, an increase in kernel size is associated {{with an increase in}} sorghum quality as defined by the parameters measured in this study...|$|R
5000|$|Later {{descriptions}} of the Dutch process involved casting metallic lead as thin buckles and corroded with acetic acid {{in the presence of}} carbon dioxide. This was done by placing them over pots with a little vinegar (which contains acetic acid). These were stacked up and covered with a mixture of decaying dung and spent tanner's bark, which supplied the CO2, and left for six to fourteen weeks, by which time the blue-grey lead had corroded to white lead. The pots were then taken to a separating table where scraping and pounding removed the white lead from the buckles. The powder was then dried and packed for shipment or shipped as a paste. One benefit of the process was that it was not necessary to dry the paste of white lead, removing its water. All that needed was to <b>mill</b> the <b>paste</b> with linseed oil, and the white lead would take up the oil and reject the residual water, to give white lead in oil.|$|R
40|$|A {{thin layer}} solar drying method was {{compared}} with a traditional method (sun drying) of paddy drying, with their effects on quality characteristics of two varieties of Iranian rice (Kamphiroozi and Sazandegi) studied. Solar drying process was conducted in a passive, mixed mode type solar dryer at about 50 ºC for 90 minutes. In sun drying method this process took 8 - 10 hours at a mean temperature of about 26 ºC. Samples were milled and polished. Quality factors including trade quality (head rice yield percent and whiteness), cooking quality (amylose content, gelatinization temperature, gel consistency, aroma and flavor) as well as nutritional quality (thiamine and lysine contents) were evaluated. For a determination of head rice yield, the percentages of de-husked and broken kernels were determined by hand-sorting of broken kernels, the calculation being done through the pertaining formula.

40|$|Grain drying trials with {{refrigerated}} and {{ambient air}} {{were conducted to}} {{study the effects of}} chilled aeration on grain quality. The paper discusses the experimental procedures and the changes in quality attributes of rice and corn. The quality attributes measured in this study were: milling yield, cooking properties, pasting properties and germination. The average grain temperature during in-store drying was 28 °C whereas temperature as low as 6 °C was maintained for chilled aeration. Rice grains were dried from 18. 3 % to 12. 6 % using chilled air and from 18. 5 % to 13. 4 % using ambient air. Similar reduction in moisture contents was obtained for corn: 19. 3 % to 12. 4 % for chilled and 19. 3 % to 11. 5 % for in-store dried grain. Milling yield of rice was not significantly affected by the drying treatments. Significant differences in pasting properties of rice and corn were observed. The peak viscosity of corn varied by as much as 40 RVU between the two treatments. A highly significant difference in germination was observed. Chilled aeration proved to better preserve the grain viability. A significantly reduced cooking time was observed for rice treated with chilled air. Lower gruel solid loss was observed for ambient air drying treatment. Technological relevance can thus be derived from the differences in various quality attributes arising from both treatments.

Both conventional and high energy milling of GBFS are considered with a milling duration varied between 1 and 10 h. X-ray diffraction, infra-red spectroscopy, granulometry analysis and scanning electron microscopy are used to draw the main lines of structural and Morphological changes occurring during <b>milling.</b> Cement <b>pastes</b> formulated using 45 % of GBFS in substitution are Characterized. Workability, X-ray diffraction analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and compressive testing ate performed to analyse main structural changes and reactions driven {{by the presence of}} milled GBFS as well as its direct consequence on the mechanical strength of slag cement <b>pastes.</b> Slag <b>milling</b> indicates the superior efficiency of high-energy milling, which allows a maximum slag finesse of 1. 79 m(2) /g after 3 h of milling. Major structural changes occur during the first 3 h of high energy milling while conventional milling does not induce any remarkable trend. These changes concern amorphisation of the bulk structure in addition to the fracturing and agglomeration of slag particles. Workability of slag cement pastes is remarkably improved when using 1 h of high-energy slag milling. This result is consistent with slag finesse trend with respect to milling time and with the improvement of GBFS reactivity. The substitution of 45 % of cement (CEM I 52. 5) by GBFS is only beneficial at the condition of performing high-energy milling for at least 1 h...|$|R

40|$|Dika nut kernels were {{extracted}} from the nuts of 24 Irvingia gabonensis fruits collected from 151 trees in three villages in Cameroon and Nigeria. Methods were developed for the <b>milling,</b> de-fatting, hot-water <b>pasting</b> and rapid visco-analysis of the samples, to simulate the cooking of dika nut meal as a food-thickening agent.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. To control the rheological properties of PVC plastisols commercial manufacturers take great care to control the particle size (PS) and particle size distribution (PSD) of a polymer latex, as these exert a strong influence over the flow characteristics of an uncompounded plastisol. However, the fundamental mechanisms controlling viscosity are not clearly understood. Several techniques {{have been developed to}} measure the PSD (sedimentation analysis and laser diffraction) and viscosity over an extended shear rate range for plastisols prepared from carefully selected paste polymers. Care has been taken to establish the reliability of these techniques, as previous workers have experienced problems in obtaining reliable correlations from plastisol systems. Xany have failed to measure the PSD within the plastisols, incorrectly basing their observations on latex PSD. By careful selection of emulsion, seeded emulsion and microsuspension paste polymers the combined effects of polymerisation technique, emulsifier type, spray drying, <b>milling</b> and <b>paste</b> preparation on plastisol rheology have been established. For many applications plastisals contain mineral fillers, which have a similar PS to the paste polymers. Addition of these materials can drastically change plastisol rheology. Until now, it has been assumed that plastisol viscosity rises with filler content and depends on plasticiser absorbtion characteristics. To elucIdate the actual mechanism controlling the response of plastisols to fillers, calcium carbonate (coated and uncoated), titanium dioxide and Spheriglass filled systems have been studied. To establish a model which will allow paste polymer systems to be designed more accurately, the paste polymers used in the initial part of this study have been spray dried under widely differing conditions. Careful measurement of the rheology and PSD of filled and unfilled plastisols prepared from these materials has highlighted the effect of PS, PSD, paste polymer porosity and filler interaction on plastisol rheology. It has been clearly demonstrated that the plasticiser absorbtion characteristics of a filler are not the only factors controlling filled plastisol rheology, as previously thought. I have shown that the response of a plastisal to filler addition also depends on the interaction between filler PS and the paste polymer PSD...|$|R

Will nobody contrive a more expeditious mode of progress? The jog-trot movement, to my thinking, is {{little less than}} positive torture. Upon my word we have not made {{more than a hundred}} miles the hour since leaving home! The very birds beat us--at least some of them. I assure you that I do not exaggerate at all. Our motion, no doubt, seems slower than it actually is--this on account of our having no objects about us by which to estimate our velocity, and on account of our going with the wind. To be sure, whenever we meet a balloon we have a chance of perceiving our rate, and then, I admit, things do not appear so very bad. Accustomed as I am to this mode of travelling, I cannot get over a kind of giddiness whenever a balloon passes us in a current directly overhead. It always seems to me like an immense bird of prey about to pounce upon us and carry us off in its claws. One went over us this morning about sunrise, and so nearly overhead that its drag-rope actually brushed the network suspending our car, and caused us very serious apprehension. Our captain said that if the material of the bag had been the trumpery varnished [...] "silk" [...] of five hundred or a thousand years ago, we should inevitably have been damaged. This silk, as he explained it to me, was a fabric composed of the entrails of a species of earth-worm. The worm was carefully fed on mulberries--kind of fruit resembling a water-melon--and, when sufficiently fat, was crushed in a <b>mill.</b> The <b>paste</b> thus arising was called papyrus in its primary state, and went through a variety of processes until it finally became [...] "silk." [...] Singular to relate, it was once much admired as an article of female dress! Balloons were also very generally constructed from it. A better kind of material, it appears, was subsequently found in the down surrounding the seed-vessels of a plant vulgarly called euphorbium, and at that time botanically termed milk-weed. This latter kind of silk was designated as silk-buckingham, on account of its superior durability, and was usually prepared for use by being varnished with a solution of gum caoutchouc--a substance which in some respects must have resembled the gutta percha now in common use. This caoutchouc was occasionally called Indian rubber or rubber of twist, and was no doubt one of the numerous fungi. Never tell me again that I am not at heart an antiquarian.|$|R

In the experiment, the nation TNuS 19 rice was adopted as the raw material. The researcher focused on effect of the pre-gelatinization of wet <b>milling</b> rice <b>paste</b> under the conditon of different ratio of rice and water as 1 : 2, 1 : 3, and 1 : 4. The analyzed items included chemical composition of rice, rapid viscosity analyze（RVA）, rice paste particle size, scanning electron micrographs（SEM）, normal and polarized light photomicrographs, colorness, moisture content, texture, hollowness, sensory evaluation. The experimental results showed below：the rice kernel adopted as the raw material absorbed equivalently（ 0. 17 g water/ g rice） after being steeped for 40 minutes. After dried by the centrifuge dehumidifier, the rice flours were tested moisture and showed the moisture 43 %~ 44 % or so. The Rapid Visco Analyze（RVA） showed dry milled rice flours have lower viscosity than frozen rice paste; the morphological structure photographed by Scanning electron microscopy of rice kernel granule with dry milled has lower completeness. The physical properties and texture experiments, rice paste pre-gelatinization process、moisture content affect the hollowness、springiness and chewiness of the products. The rice and water ratio 1 : 2 was more harder, but 1 : 4 was softer. Microstructures of 1 : 2, 1 : 3, 1 : 4 we observed photographed by SEM are from compactness to sponginess. The result of sensory evaluation showed that rice and water ratio 1 : 3 is more popular among the evaluators. In conclusion, after rice steeping for 40 minutes, wet-milled rice paste with 1 : 3, set gelatization time 180 seconds, finally in the process of steaming, following procedure above we can get better products.

However, large amounts of foam occurred in the <b>paste</b> <b>milling</b> and cooking processes during the manufacture of soymilk, and this would make kitchen dirty and cause wasting and inconvenient. Therefore, this problem {{whether there is a}} necessity to add antifoamer, silicon resin, in the production of market-sold soymilk deserves study. This research randomly sampled market-sold soymilk, and used atomic absorption spectroscopy to detect the content of silicon resin. On the other hand, Response surface methodology（RSM）was also used study process variables, such as soaking temperature, blending temperature, soaking time, and blending concentration, on the foaming of soymilk with different filtration treatments. 101 market-sold soymilk were to undergo atomic absorption spectroscopy determination. Si content was found to be randomly sampled high in 14 samples including 11 sweet soymilk and plain soymilk 3. For the sources, 11 samples were purchased from breakfast store, 3 form convenient store, manufactured by food processing plant. Preliminary test on the foaming of soymilk found: 1. soaking temperature 、 blending temperature related to foaming; 2. cloth-filtration soymilk possessed singnificantly less foaming compared to other filtration treatments. Effects of soaking temperature, blending temperature, soaking time on the foaming are as follows; 1. The significance of those three process variables was found to be blending temperature>soaking time>soaking temperature; 2. cloth-filtration soymilk foaming was affected by soaking temperature, blending temperature and soaking time, and least foaming 30 ℃soaking temperature, 30 ℃ blending temperature, and soaking was found at time 4 hrs. Besides, the significance of effects soaking temperature, blending temperature, blending concentration are as follows: 1. the significance of those three process variables was found to be blending temperature>blending concentration >soaking temperature; 2. the net-filtration soymilk foaming was found to be least at 90 ℃ soaking temperature, 90 ℃blending temperature, and 6 times blending water addition; 3. cloth-filtration soymilk at 30 ℃ soaking temperature, 60 ℃ blending temperature and 8 times blending water addition was found to foam least. According to the results of this research, it was found that foaming reduced and foaming stability decreased with the increase of silicon resin addition. 豆奶(soymilk) 是一種大眾化的黃豆加工品，價格便宜，營養成分高，但是在加工過程中，會因磨漿或加熱煮沸而引起大量泡沫，因而污損廚具，或引起蒸煮的不順暢，及產品的浪費；因此，一般市售產品的加工過程中，是否常會添加有消泡劑─矽樹脂（silicon resin），便是本研究所欲探討的問題。本研究中逢機採樣市售豆奶，利用原子吸收光譜儀檢測矽之含量，以了解市售豆奶中消泡劑的添加情形。另一方面，本研究亦利用反應曲面法（RSM）探討浸泡溫度、研磨溫度、浸泡時間及研磨濃度等因子，對不同過濾方式之豆奶起泡情形的影響。 研究結果逢機取樣一○一件市售豆奶，經原子吸收光譜儀檢測發現，其中十四件矽含量偏高，十一件為甜味豆奶，三件為清漿(未調味) ；在購買來源方面，十一件購自早餐店，三件購於便利商店，其來源為食品工廠製造。對豆奶起泡性預備試驗探討所得結果發現： 1. 浸泡黃豆溫度、研磨溫度與起泡量有關。 2. 三種過濾方式（未過濾、過濾網、過濾布）起泡量比較，以過濾布濾得之豆奶，其起泡量均有明顯下降。另以不同之浸泡黃豆溫度、研磨溫度及浸泡時間對豆奶起泡性之相關性結果為： 1. 三個操作因子對豆奶起泡之影響力為：硏磨溫度>浸泡時間>浸泡溫度。 2. 浸泡溫度、研磨溫度、浸泡時間等三個操作因子的確對布過濾所得之豆奶樣品起泡量有密切的相關性，於 30 ℃浸泡溫度、 30 ℃研磨溫度及 4 小時的浸泡時間起泡量最少。此外浸泡黃豆溫度、研磨溫度及研磨濃度對豆奶起泡性之影響為： 1. 三個操作因子對三種過濾方式濾得豆奶起泡之影響力為：硏磨溫度>硏磨濃度>浸泡溫度。 2. 網過濾豆奶，於 90 ℃浸泡溫度、 90 ℃研磨溫度及 6 倍水研磨黃豆時起泡量最少。 3. 布過濾豆奶，於 30 ℃浸泡溫度、 60 ℃研磨溫度及 8 倍水研磨黃豆時起泡量最少。由試驗發現隨著矽樹脂添加量增加，豆奶起泡量減少，且泡沫呈現不穩定情形。目錄 頁次 壹、前言 ……………………………………………………………… 1 貳、文獻整理 ………………………………………………………… 2 一、豆奶 …………………………………………………………… 2 （一）豆奶的營養成分 ……………………………………………… 2 （二）豆奶的製造 …………………………………………………… 6 （三）起泡 …………………………………………………………… 8 （四）消泡方法 ……………………………………………………… 9 （五）矽樹脂 ………………………………………………………… 11 二、反應曲面法 ……………………………………………………… 13 三、原子吸收光譜分析 ……………………………………………… 20 參、研究目的 ………………………………………………………… 27 肆、材料與方法 ……………………………………………………… 28 一、市售豆奶產品中的消泡劑含量 ………………………………… 28 （一）試驗材料 ……………………………………………………… 28 （二）試驗方法 ……………………………………………………… 29 1. 試驗設計 ……………………………………………………… 29 2. 樣品製備 ……………………………………………………… 29 3. 矽含量測定 …………………………………………………… 32 二、不同條件因子對豆奶起泡性之影響 …………………………… 34 （一) 試驗材料 ……………………………………………………… 34 （二) 試驗方法 ……………………………………………………… 34 1. 預備試驗 ……………………………………………………… 34 2. 試驗設計 ……………………………………………………… 35 3. 樣品製備 ……………………………………………………… 35 4. 測定項目 ……………………………………………………… 38 5. 反應曲面法統計分析…………………………………………… 41 三、添加矽樹脂之豆奶起泡性與泡沫安定性探討 ……………… 41 伍、結果與討論 ……………………………………………………… 44 一、原子吸收光譜分析結果的探討 ………………………………… 44 （一）採樣分析 ……………………………………………………… 44 （二）豆奶標準品矽（si）含量 …………………………………… 51 （三）分析結果 ……………………………………………………… 52 二、不同條件因子對豆奶起泡性影響的探討 ……………………… 53 (一）預備試驗 ……………………………………………………… 53 (二）起泡量分析 …………………………………………………… 59 1. 浸泡溫度、研磨溫度、浸泡時間的影響 …………………… 59 2. 浸泡溫度、研磨溫度、研磨濃度的影響 …………………… 71 三、添加矽樹脂之豆奶起泡性與泡沫安定性探討 ……………… 83 陸、結論 ……………………………………………………………… 87 柒、中文摘要 ………………………………………………………… 90 捌、英文摘要 ………………………………………………………… 92 玖、參考文獻 ………………………………………………………… 94 圖表目錄 表次 頁次 表一 豆奶的營養成分………………………………………………… 4 表二 豆奶、牛奶與母奶的營養比較………………………………… 5 表三 傳統試驗與RSM試驗所需點數之比較…………………………… 17 表四 反應曲面分析之三變數、三層階試驗設計…………………… 18 表五 常用於原子吸收光譜分析的燃燒劑…………………………… 24 表六 製備添加不等量矽樹脂之豆奶標準品………………………… 33 表七 豆奶試驗的三因子（浸泡溫度、研磨溫度、浸泡時間） 三層階反應曲面設計中之操作條件變數及其階層 …………… 36 表八 豆奶試驗的三因子（浸泡溫度、研磨溫度、研磨濃度） 三層階反應曲面設計中之操作條件變數及其階層…………… 37 表九 豆奶樣品添加矽樹脂量表……………………………………… 43 表十 市售豆奶樣品取樣一覽表……………………………………… 45 表十一 豆奶標準品之Si含量測定結果……………………………… 52 表十二 浸泡溫度、研磨溫度、浸泡時間對不同過濾方式 豆奶起泡量(ml）之數據…………………………………… 60 表十三 不同過濾方式豆奶起泡性的反應曲面回歸模式之變方分析 61 表十四 不同之過濾方式豆奶製作時之條件因子（浸泡溫度、研磨溫度 、浸泡時間）對起泡性之整體總合作用的變方分析……… 62 表十五 不同之過濾方式豆奶起泡性與加工條件因子（浸泡溫度、 研磨溫度、浸泡時間）間二次多項式之回歸係數………… 63 表十六 浸泡溫度、研磨溫度、研磨濃度對不同過濾方式 豆奶起泡量(ml）之數據……………………………………… 73 表十七 不同過濾方式豆奶起泡性的反應曲面回歸模式之變方分析… 74 表十八 不同倍數之豆奶研磨水豆奶製作時之條件因子（浸泡溫度、 研磨溫度研磨濃度）對起泡性之整體總合作用的變方分析… 75 表十九 不同之過濾方式豆奶起泡性與加工條件因子（浸泡溫度、 研磨溫度、研磨濃度）間二次多項式之回歸係數…………… 76 表二十 矽樹脂添加對豆奶起泡量與泡沫不穩定性之影響…………… 84 圖次 頁次 圖一 傳統中式豆奶製造流程…………………………………………… 8 圖二 消泡劑的消泡作用機制…………………………………………… 12 圖三 反應曲面法的步驟流程…………………………………………… 15 圖四 原子吸收光譜儀的構造…………………………………………… 23 圖五 原子吸收光譜儀測定礦物質的操作流程………………………… 26 圖六 市售豆奶矽樹脂含量測定樣品之製備流程……………………… 30 圖七 豆奶起泡性測定樣品之製備……………………………………… 38 圖八 泡沫測定裝置……………………………………………………… 40 圖九 執行反應曲面回歸之SAS程式…………………………………… 42 圖十 市售豆奶取樣來源分析…………………………………………… 48 圖十一 市售豆奶取樣地區分析………………………………………… 49 圖十二 市售豆奶取樣種類分析………………………………………… 50 圖十三 25 ℃水浸泡黃豆時之起泡情形………………………………… 54 圖十四 50 ℃水浸泡黃豆時之起泡情形………………………………… 55 圖十五 70 ℃水浸泡黃豆時之起泡情形………………………………… 56 圖十六 85 ℃水浸泡黃豆時之起泡情形………………………………… 57 圖十七 100 ℃水浸泡黃豆時起泡情形………………………………… 58 圖十八 在固定浸泡溫度下研磨溫度和浸泡時間對未過濾豆奶 起泡量之等性狀曲線圖……………………………………… 68 圖十九 在固定浸泡溫度下研磨溫度和浸泡時間對網過濾豆奶 起泡量之等性狀曲線圖……………………………………… 69 圖二十 在固定浸泡溫度下研磨溫度和浸泡時間對布過濾豆奶 起泡量之等性狀曲線圖……………………………………… 70 圖二十一 在固定浸泡溫度下研磨溫度和研磨濃度對未過濾豆奶 起泡量之等性狀曲線圖……………………………………… 80 圖二十二 在固定浸泡溫度下研磨溫度和研磨濃度對網過濾豆奶 起泡量之等性狀曲圖……………………………………… 81 圖二十三 在固定浸泡溫度下研磨溫度和研磨濃度對布過濾豆奶 起泡量之等性狀曲線圖……………………………………… 82 圖二十四 矽樹脂添加量對豆奶起泡量之影響………………………… 85 圖二十五 矽樹脂添加量對豆奶泡沫不穩定性之影響………………… 8...|$|R
