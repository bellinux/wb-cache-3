25|$|The {{refractive}} index (1.7) and optical dispersion properties of germanium dioxide makes it useful as an optical material for wide-angle lenses, in optical <b>microscope</b> <b>objective</b> lenses, {{and for the}} core of fiber-optic lines. See Optical fiber for specifics on the manufacturing process. Both Germanium and its glass oxide, GeO2 are transparent to the infrared spectrum. The glass can be manufactured into IR windows and lenses, used for night-vision technology in the military, luxury vehicles, and Thermographic cameras. GeO2 is preferred over other IR transparent glasses because it is mechanically strong and therefore preferred for rugged military usage.|$|E
25|$|In a {{laboratory}} environment, a bare fiber end is coupled using a fiber launch system, {{which uses a}} <b>microscope</b> <b>objective</b> lens to focus the light down to a fine point. A precision translation stage (micro-positioning table) is used to move the lens, fiber, or device to allow the coupling efficiency to be optimized. Fibers with a connector on the end make this process much simpler: the connector is simply plugged into a pre-aligned fiberoptic collimator, which contains a lens that is either accurately positioned {{with respect to the}} fiber, or is adjustable. To achieve the best injection efficiency into single-mode fiber, the direction, position, size and divergence of the beam must all be optimized. With good beams, 70 to 90% coupling efficiency can be achieved.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{tweezers}} {{are capable}} of manipulating nanometer and micron-sized dielectric particles by exerting extremely small forces via a highly focused laser beam. The beam is typically focused by sending it through a <b>microscope</b> <b>objective.</b> The narrowest point of the focused beam, known as the beam waist, contains a very strong electric field gradient. Dielectric particles are attracted along the gradient to the region of strongest electric field, which {{is the center of}} the beam. The laser light also tends to apply a force on particles in the beam along the direction of beam propagation. This is due to conservation of momentum: photons that are absorbed or scattered by the tiny dielectric particle impart momentum to the dielectric particle. This is known as the scattering force and results in the particle being displaced slightly downstream from the exact position of the beam waist, as seen in the figure.|$|E

The {{size of the}} spores varies depending upon the type of asci in which they develop: in one-spored asci they measure 42.5–62.5 by 17.5–30µm; in two-spored asci they are 32.5–50 by 15–25µm; in three-spored asci they are 27.5–45 by 15–25µm; in four-spored asci they are 25–38.5 by 13–28µm; in five-spored asci 28–34 by 22–25µm (all sizes excluding surface ornamentation). The spore walls are 2–3µm thick and are covered with a honeycomb-like (...) network. The cavities of the honeycomb typically have five or six sides, and the corners form spines that are 5–7µm tall by 0.5µm thick.

Young asci range in shape from spherical to broadly ellipsoid to ovoid (egg-shaped) or pyriform (pear-shaped); sometimes the base of the ascus is narrowed like a stipe,and measures up to 15 by 7µm. Mature asci are spherical to broadly ellipsoid or misshapen from the pressure of crowded spores within.

2500|$|The typical FCS setup {{consists}} of a laser line (wavelengths ranging typically from 405–633nm (cw), and from 690–1100nm (pulsed)), which is reflected into a <b>microscope</b> <b>objective</b> by a dichroic mirror. The laser beam is focused in the sample, which contains fluorescent particles (molecules) in such high dilution, {{that only a few}} are within the focal spot (usually 1–100 molecules in one fL). When the particles cross the focal volume, they fluoresce. This light is collected by the same objective and, because it is red-shifted with respect to the excitation light it passes the dichroic mirror reaching a detector, typically a photomultiplier tube, an avalanche photodiode detector or a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector. [...] The resulting electronic signal can be stored either directly as an intensity versus time trace to be analyzed at a later point, or computed to generate the autocorrelation directly (which requires special acquisition cards). The FCS curve by itself only represents a time-spectrum. Conclusions on physical phenomena have to be extracted from there with appropriate models. The parameters of interest are found after fitting the autocorrelation curve to modeled functional forms.|$|E

While, however, the magnification of the individual zones is the same, it is not the same for red as for blue; and there is a chromatic difference of magnification. This is produced in the same amount, but in the opposite sense, by the oculars, which Abbe used with these objectives (compensating oculars), so that it is eliminated {{in the image of the}} whole microscope. The best telescope objectives, and photographic objectives intended for three-color work, are also apochromatic, even if they do not possess quite the same quality of correction as <b>microscope</b> <b>objectives</b> do.
