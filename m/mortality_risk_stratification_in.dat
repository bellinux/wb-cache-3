40|$|Background: Patients with ischemic {{cardiomyopathy}} (ICM) are at {{an increased}} risk for sudden death. Although earlier trials used programmed electrical stimulation (PES) for risk stratification, more recent data demonstrate the benefit of implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) in selected patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) without performing PES. However, {{little is known about}} the outcome of non-inducible patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of PES for <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> <b>in</b> patients with ICM. Methods: All consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria (history of coronary artery disease, LVEF≤ 35 %, and absence of documented spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia or aborted sudden cardiac death) were included in the study. The stimulation protocol involved up to three extrastimuli from two different sites in the right ventricle, with 180  ms as the shortest coupling interval. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Results: A total of 198 patients were included in the study; of these, 60 exhibited negative (−) PES, and 138 had positive (+) PES and also underwent ICD implantation. The mean follow-up duration was 4. 5 years. There was no difference in age or LVEF between the patient groups. We found a trend towards an increased 5 -year survival rate in the (+) PES group in whom ICD implantation had been performed (p= 0. 058). Survival was significantly better in patients under 68 year olds in the (+) PES group in whom ICD implantation was performed (hazard ratio= 0. 3, p= 0. 01). The survival rate of patients ≥ 68 years old was similar in both groups (p= 0. 95).

40|$|Background: The {{percentage}} of patients referred for {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG) who have previously undergone percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) is increasing. The {{purpose of this study}} was to review the outcomes of patients who had received coronary stenting before CABG, and to examine the validity of a <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> system <b>in</b> this patient group. Methods: From 2010 to 2012, 439 patients who underwent isolated CABG at our medical center were reviewed. The patients were divided into two study groups: those who had previously received coronary artery stenting (97 patients, 24. 7 %), and those who had not (342 patients, 75. 3 %). The patients who received balloon angioplasty were excluded. Results: There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics. The prior stenting group had a lower <b>risk</b> of <b>mortality,</b> although the difference was not significant. The prior stenting group had fewer graft anastomoses (p =  0. 005), and hence a significantly shorter cardiopulmonary bypass time (p =  0. 045) and shorter aortic cross-clamping time. Surgical mortality was similar between the two groups. The durations of intensive care unit stay and hospitalization were also similar. The discriminatory power of the logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) was lower in both group.

40|$|Background. It {{remains unknown}} whether a {{composite}} of inflammation and calcification markers provides better <b>mortality</b> and cardiovascular <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> <b>in</b> chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Methods. We performed a 4 -year prospective follow-up study in 231 chronic PD patients from a single regional dialysis centre in Hong Kong. Valvular calcification was detected using echocardiography, and fasting venous blood was collected to measure a panel of inflammation markers. The patients were stratified into five groups {{on the basis of}} 0, 1, 2, 3 and all 4 inflammation and calcification risk markers, namely high C-reactive protein (CRP) (CRP in upper tertile), high interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) (IL- 6 in upper tertile), low fetuin-A (fetuin-A in lower tertile) and valvular calcification. Study outcomes included all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events (CVEs). Results. The patients with 4, 3, 2 and 1 markers had an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5. 17 (95 CI, 1. 81 - 14. 77, P = 0. 002), 3. 38 (95 CI, 1. 50 - 7. 60; P = 0. 003), 2. 17 (95 CI, 0. 98 - 4. 77; P = 0. 056) and 2. 42 (95 CI, 1. 18 - 4. 96; P = 0. 016), respectively, for mortality at 4 years than those with 0 risk marker. The adjusted HRs for fatal or non-fatal CVEs were 4. 33 (95 CI, 1. 70 - 11. 03; P = 0. 002), 1. 60 (95 CI, 0. 73 - 3. 52; P = 0. 24), 1. 92 (95 CI, 0. 95 - 3. 90; P = 0. 07) and 1. 33 (95 CI, 0. 67 - 2. 62; P = 0. 42), respectively, for patients with 4, 3, 2 and 1 markers than those with 0 risk markers. Conclusions. A composite of inflammation and calcification markers provides long-term prognostication and identifies the sickest PD patients with the worst clinical outcomes.

40|$|Objective Patients with {{repaired}} tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) have {{an increased}} long-term risk of cardiovascular morbidity and <b>mortality.</b> <b>Risk</b> <b>stratification</b> <b>in</b> this population is difficult. Initial evidence suggests that cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) {{may be helpful to}} risk-stratify patients with repaired ToF. Methods and results We studied 875 patients after surgical repair for ToF (358 females, age 25. 5 ± 11. 7 year, range 7 - 75 years) who underwent CPET between 1999 and 2009. During a mean follow-up of 4. 1 ± 2. 6 years after CPET, 30 patients (3. 4 %) died or had sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). 225 patients (25. 7 %) had other cardiac related events (emergency admission, surgery, or catheter interventions). On multivariable Cox regression-analysis, %predicted peak oxygen uptake (V O 2 %) (p = 0. 001), resting QRS duration (p = 0. 030) and age (p < 0. 001) emerged as independent predictors of mortality or sustained VT. Patients with a peak VO 2 65 % of predicted and a resting QRS duration 170 ms had a 11. 4 -fold risk of death or sustained VT. Ventilatory efficiency expressed as VE/VCO 2 slope (p 0. 001), peak VO 2 % (p =. 001), QRS duration (p =. 001) and age (p = 0. 046) independently predicted event free survival. VE/VCO 2 slope 31. 0, peak VO 2 % 65 % and QRS duration 170 ms were the cut-off points with best sensitivity and specificity to detect an unfavorable outcome. Conclusions CPET is an important predictive tool that may assist in the risk stratification of patients with ToF. Subjects with a poor exercise capacity in addition to a prolonged QRS duration have a substantially increased risk for death or sustained ventricular tachycardia, as well as for cardiac-related hospitalizations...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: New {{scores have}} been {{developed}} and validated in the US for in-hospital <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> <b>in</b> patients undergoing coronary angioplasty: the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) risk score and the Mayo Clinic Risk Score (MCRS). We sought to validate these scores in a European population with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and to compare their predictive accuracy {{with that of the}} GRACE risk score. METHODS: In a single-center ACS registry of patients undergoing coronary angioplasty, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), a graphical representation of observed vs. expected mortality, and net reclassification improvement (NRI) /integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) analysis to compare the scores. RESULTS: A total of 2148 consecutive patients were included, mean age 63 years (SD 13), 74 % male and 71 % with ST-segment elevation ACS. In-hospital mortality was 4. 5 %. The GRACE score showed the best AUC (0. 94, 95 % CI 0. 91 - 0. 96) compared with NCDR (0. 87, 95 % CI 0. 83 - 0. 91, p= 0. 0003) and MCRS (0. 85, 95 % CI 0. 81 - 0. 90, p= 0. 0003). In model calibration analysis, GRACE showed the best predictive power. With GRACE, patients were more often correctly classified than with MCRS (NRI 78. 7, 95 % CI 59. 6 - 97. 7; IDI 0. 136, 95 % CI 0. 073 - 0. 199) or NCDR (NRI 79. 2, 95 % CI 60. 2 - 98. 2; IDI 0. 148, 95 % CI 0. 087 - 0. 209). CONCLUSION: The NCDR and Mayo Clinic risk scores are useful for risk stratification of in-hospital mortality in a European population of patients with ACS undergoing coronary angioplasty.

40|$|Background: Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery, as {{measured}} by troponin elevation, is strongly associated with mortality. However, it is unknown in which patients prognosis can be improved. The presence of kinetic changes of troponin {{may be associated with}} a worse prognosis and warrant more aggressive management. Therefore, we aimed to study the kinetics of troponin in patients with postoperative myocardial injury, and to determine the added predictive value of kinetic changes of troponin on mortality. Methods: This cohort study included patients with myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery. Troponin I (TnI) w{{as measured}} on the first three postoperative days. The primary outcome was all-cause 1 -year mortality. We studied both absolute and relative TnI changes, and determined the delta TnI that was associated with mortality to distinguish a rise-and-fall TnI pattern from a stable TnI pattern. Next, we determined the added predictive value of a rise-and-fall TnI pattern for mortality. Results: In total, 634 patients were included. The risk ratio (RR) for mortality increased significantly with an absolute delta TnI of ≥ 200 ng/L (RR 1. 5, 99. 4 % CI 1. 0. 2. 2, p = 0. 003). Using this delta TnI to define a rise-and-fall pattern, 459 patients (72 %) had a stable TnI pattern and 175 patients (28 %) had a rise-and-fall pattern. When added to a model including the highest TnI value and variables from the revised cardiac risk index (RCRI), the TnI pattern did not increase the predictive value for mortality. Conclusions: A postoperative TnI rise-and-fall pattern was associated with 1 -year mortality, but had no added value in addition to the highest TnI level to predict 1 -year mortality. Therefore, postoperative TnI kinetics are not useful for further <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> <b>in</b> patients with myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery...|$|E

Methods We examined the association between eGFR and mortality among 16, 010 participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Primary predictors were eGFR CKD-EPI and eGFR MDRD. Outcomes of interest were all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) <b>mortality.</b> Improvement in <b>risk</b> categorization with eGFR CKD-EPI was evaluated using adjusted relative hazard (HR) and Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Association between {{body mass}} index (BMI) and {{long-term}} mortality is poorly studied in older hospitalized populations. METHODS: The researchers prospectively studied {{the impact of the}} BMI, comorbidities, and malnutrition on long-term mortality in 444 patients (mean age 85. 3 +/- 6. 7 years; 74. 0 % women) receiving geriatric inpatient care. All-cause mortality was determined using simple and multiple Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Higher BMI was associated with a higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure, but with a lower prevalence of malignancies. Four-year all-cause mortality was inversely associated with a BMI {{greater than or equal to}} 30 kg/m(2) (hazard ratio = 0. 59, p =. 037) and positively associated with age, male gender, several individual comorbidities, and the global disease load determined by the Cumulative Illness Rating scale. The inverse association between a BMI greater than or equal to 30 and mortality remained significant after adjustment for age, gender, smoking, individual comorbidities (including heart failure and malignancies), Cumulative Illness Rating scale scores, and malnutrition parameters (hazard ratio = 0. 52, p =. 015). One-year mortality was associated with the Cumulative Illness Rating scale score but not with BMI categories. There were no survival differences between patients in low (< 20. 0) and intermediate (20. 0 - 24. 9 and 25. 0 - 29. 9) BMI categories. CONCLUSIONS: A BMI greater than or equal to 30 is associated with better long-term survival in hospitalized older patients, even after extensive adjustment for comorbidities, malnutrition, and smoking. Conversely, a low BMI (< 20 - 25) is not associated with excess mortality, likely due to the overriding impact of multiple comorbidities. The researchers' observations have important implications for the <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> <b>in</b> older high-risk patients...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to derive and {{validate}} a model to predict survival in candidates for HeartMate II (HMII) (Thoratec, Pleasanton, California) left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. BackgroundLVAD mortality risk prediction is important for candidate selection and communicating expectations to patients and clinicians. With the evolution of LVAD support, prior risk prediction models have become less valid. MethodsPatients enrolled into the HMII bridge to transplantation and destination therapy trials (N = 1, 122) were randomly divided into derivation (DC) (n = 583) and validation cohorts (VC) (n = 539). Pre-operative candidate predictors of 90 -day mortality were examined in the DC with logistic regression, from which the HMII Risk Score (HMRS) was derived. The HMRS was then applied to the VC. ResultsThere were 149 (13 %) deaths within 90 days. In the DC, mortality (n = 80) was higher in older patients (odds ratio [OR]: 1. 3, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 1 to 1. 7 per 10 years), those with greater hypoalbuminemia (OR: 0. 49, 95 % CI: 0. 31 to 0. 76 per mg/dl of albumin), renal dysfunction (OR: 2. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 4 to 3. 2 per mg/dl creatinine), coagulopathy (OR: 3. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 7 to 5. 8 per international normalized ratio unit), and in those receiving LVAD support at less experienced centers (OR: 2. 2, 95 % CI: 1. 2 to 4. 4 for < 15 trial patients). Mortality in the DC low, medium, and high HMRS groups was 4 %, 16 %, and 29 %, respectively (p < 0. 001). In the VC, corresponding mortality was 8 %, 11 %, and 25 %, respectively (p < 0. 001). HMRS discrimination was good (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve: 0. 71, 95 % CI: 0. 66 to 0. 75).

40|$|New European {{recommendations}} on management of stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation have been published. They {{introduce a new}} <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> score called CHA 2 DS 2 VASc, which may allow for better thromboembolic risk discrimination amongst low risk patients. We review stroke <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> <b>in</b> atrial fibrillation, limitations of available scores and discuss the practical implications of the new recommendations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{interesting}} {{data reported}} by Bernhardt et al. strengthen the diagnostic benefit of CMR {{in patients with}} ischemic cardiomyopathy. Consequently, the presence, location {{and size of the}} CMRdetermined scar tissue may be used for better <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> <b>in</b> patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy eligible for ICD therapy...|$|R
30|$|The {{clinical}} CardShock risk score, including baseline lactate levels, {{was recently}} shown to facilitate <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> <b>in</b> patients with cardiogenic shock (CS). As based on baseline parameters, however, it may {{not reflect the}} change in <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> in response to initial therapies. Adrenomedullin is a prognostic biomarker in several cardiovascular diseases and was recently shown to associate with hemodynamic instability in patients with septic shock. The aim of our study was to evaluate the prognostic value and association with hemodynamic parameters of bioactive adrenomedullin (bio-ADM) in patients with CS.|$|R
