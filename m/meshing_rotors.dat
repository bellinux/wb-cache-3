The rotor sand casing are separated by very small clearances. They may operate without internal lubrication, oil injected or with other fluids injected during the compression process. The rapid acceptance of screw compressors in various industries over the past thirty years is due to the irrelatively high rotational speeds compared to other types of positive displacement machines which make them compact, their ability to maintain high efficiencies over a wide range of operating pressure sand flow rates and their long service life and high reliability.

Their performance is highly affected by leakages, which is dependent on various clearances and the pressure differences across these clearances.

40|$|Screw {{compressors}} {{are complex}} flow systems, but operate upon simple considerations: they are positive displacement machines consisting of <b>meshing</b> <b>rotors</b> {{contained in a}} casing to form a working chamber, whose volume depends only on the angle of rotation. Although the basic operation of twin screw compressors is well understood and the analytical methods for performance prediction are well established, the CFD analysis of such machines {{is still in its}} early days and requires more research in order to mature to the level of standardised application, {{as is the case with}} most turbomachinery applications. The performance of screw compressors is highly affected by leakages, which are dependent on various clearances and the pressure differences across these clearances. The numerical simulation of the leakage flows is the challenging aspect of running CFD in screw compressors, as the flow domain reduces in tip areas to the order of several microns. Commercial grid generators struggle in reproducing the flow path with good quality elements and user defined meshing techniques are currently available to allow the remeshing of the rotors domain to capture the modified aspect of the compression chamber at the start of each time step. This technique allows the full compressor performance prediction by means of CFD but does not allow for local mesh refinement in the tip area, where the turbulent character of the flow requires adequate boundary layer considerations. This is the area of concern in the present paper, where several means of investigating the flow in the very tight tip clearance area are proposed: 1) a three-dimensional model of all interacting compression chambers to investigate the effects of employing mesh-deforming techniques for the compressor simulation; 2) a simplified two-dimensional leakage model to identify the mesh refinement requirements for appropriate turbulence modelling.

Varying the disk proximity to the water surface/bed introduces differential mass flow rates above and below the rotor disk that can cause the wake to persist much further downstream.

Concentration of liquid in the inlet flow can influence the performance of the machine significantly. Characteristics of the multiphase flow at the suction of a screw compressor depend on the local flow velocities and concentration. Local flow velocity measurements inside the screw compressors are difficult to obtain. However other flow properties such as local pressures are easier to attain. It is therefore useful to carry out experiments with local pressure variations in the suction which can be used to validate the 3 D numerical Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) models that could help in studying the single and multiphase flow behaviour in screw compressors.

40|$|Due to {{the growing}} {{interest}} from engine and aircraft manufacturers for contra-rotating open rotors (CROR), much effort is presently devoted {{to the development of}} reliable computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodologies for the prediction of performance, aerodynamic loads, and acoustics. Forces transverse to the rotation axis of the propellers, commonly called in-plane forces (or sometimes 1 P forces), are a major concern for the structural sizing of the aircraft and for vibrations. In-plane forces impact strongly the stability and the balancing of the aircraft and, consequently, the horizontal tail plane (HTP) and the vertical tail plane (VTP) sizing. Also, in-plane forces can initiate a flutter phe- nomenon on the blades or on the whole engine system. Finally, these forces are unsteady and may lead to vibrations on the whole aircraft, which may degrade the comfort of the passengers and lead to structural fatigue. These forces can be predicted by numerical methods and wind tunnel measurements. However, a reliable estimation of in-plane forces requires validated prediction approaches. To reach this objective, comparisons between several numerical methods and wind tunnel data campaigns are necessary. The primary objective of the paper is to provide a physical analysis of the aerodynamics of in-plane forces for a CROR in high speed at nonzero angle of attack using unsteady simulations. Confidence in the numerical results is built through a code-to-code comparison, which is a first step in the verification process of in-plane forces prediction. Thus, two computa- tional processes for unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) simulations of an isolated open rotor at nonzero angle of attack are compared: computational strategy, open <b>rotor</b> <b>meshing,</b> aerodynamic results (<b>rotor</b> forces, blades thrust, and pressure distributions). In a second step, the paper focuses on the understanding of the key aerodynamic mechanisms behind the physics of in-plane forces. For the front rotor, two effects are predominant: the first is due to the orientation of the freestream velocity, and the second is due to the distribution of the induced velocity. For the rear rotor, the freestream velocity effect is reduced but is still dominant. The swirl generated by the front rotor also {{plays a major role in}} the modulus and the direction of the in-plane force. Finally, aerodynamic interactions are found to have a minor effect...|$|R

The flow conditions for marine devices are distinctly different than for similar {{technologies such as}} the wind energy industry. The constrained nature of the operating fluid in the vertical plane is likely to introduce some interesting flow effects for marine current energy converters (MCECs). Experimental work was conducted at two indoor facilities. The first was the Chilworth hydraulics laboratory at the University of Southampton, UK. The working section of this flume is 21 m in length, 1. 35 m width and maximum depth 0. 4 m for steady operation.

A Nortek Vectrino ADV device was used for high frequency velocity sampling.

Modelling work is carried out using the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver FLUENT. Motivation for this project was {{the fact that there is}} currently limited knowledge on several issues that affect the operation of a wind farm in a complex terrain environment. Wind developers normally use commercial, easy-to-use software (such as WAsP) to predict the potential wind farm output, which are based on simple linear models to model wakes and wind flow orographic effects and have been calibrated for cases of simple terrain. In cases of complex terrain, they are expected to give errors due to arising non-linearities. After a review of the relevant literature, the chosen CFD procedure is explained. This involves the use of 3 -D Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations using the Reynolds Stress Model for the turbulence closure, in order to account for the anisotropy in atmospheric turbulence. The Virtual Blade Model in FLUENT is demonstrated as a useful tool for modelling the rotor effects without the need of <b>meshing</b> the <b>rotor</b> geometry in detail and avoiding significant computational cost. The approach is initially validated with the widely documented Nibe measurements, which involved full-scale observations of a single wake over at terrain. The model is also tested in the case of a wind turbine operating at the summit of an ideal, Gaussian hill. The wake development is examined in detail and in comparison with another CFD approach. Most notably, a slight divergence is found in the wake path as it evolves downwind. Additionally, the proposed approaches of modelling the neutral atmospheric ow over a real hill and over a forest are validated with full-scale measurements. Ultimately, the work includes the modelling of real wind farms over complex terrain and validating the results with measurements. A coastal complex terrain wind farm is initially examined and results are validated with SCADA measurements and compared with results using the WAsP wind modelling software. Finally, a wind farm over hilly terrain and near forests is also considered and the effect of the forest in the wake is studied. Results are also validated with full-scale measurements.

40|$|Because of the {{increasing}} attention to fuel consumption and anticipated legislation, the Flettner rotor has attained renewed interest recently as an auxiliary ship propulsion device. To improve {{the understanding of the}} flow involved, the flow structure around a Flettner rotor is studied by both three-dimensional PIV measurements and RANS simulation for a case with Re equal to 2. 0  104, based on the inlet velocity (U) and cylinder diameter (D) for the aspect ratio 6, and spin ratio equal to 4. 3. A test model of Flettner rotor is installed in the wind tunnel. A thin polymethyl methacrylate disk with diameter of 2 D is installed at the top the cylinder following Prandtl 1. The horizontal measurement plane is perpendicular to the axis of cylinder as shown in figure 1. To build up the fully three dimensional measurement data, 62 sequences of two-dimensional three components measurements at different axial position are made. The steady RANS simulation is done with SST k –ω model. The geometry of Fletter rotor as in wind tunnel measurement is used. The size of computation domain is chosen according to the one in the literature 2. The domain is discretized by a hexahedral mesh, with the carefully designed boundary layer <b>mesh</b> around the <b>rotor</b> (see Figure 1). A uniform velocity inlet boundary condition is used for the inlet and slip boundary condition is chosen for the sides. Both PIV measurement and CFD show similar vortices around the rotor but with some differences as indicated in Figure 2 : the simulation cannot well predict the flow at the middle plane, which important for the lift prediction. Further verification and validation will be done with force measurement...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{methods and}} {{computational}} techniques for predicting the static and steady state {{characteristics of a}} switched reluctance motor drive are developed and the predicted characteristics are compared with experimental results. Because of high local saturation and narrow airgap in the SR motor, accurate calculation of the static characteristics of the torque, flux linkage, inductances, and speed emf from its FE field solution is not straightforward. For {{the purpose of this}} study, a two-dimensional finite element model is developed to handle the nonlinear magnetic field inside the machine. Based on a thorough study of the potential sources of errors in the field solution and in the computational methods used in postprocessing, new guidelines are developed regarding the shape and uniformity of the mesh in the airgap and the preservation of these qualities of the <b>mesh</b> as the <b>rotor</b> is rotated. When the proposed guidelines on the mesh configuration and its rotation were used, significant improvement in the accuracy of the field distribution and in the accuracy of the predicted torque/angle characteristics as compared to the experimentally measured torque was observed. Furthermore, all three methods of torque calculation, namely global virtual work, local virtual work, and Maxwell-stress tensor methods are converging to the same results and the torque/angle characteristics are smooth. Improvement in the prediction of such static characteristics is also essential to a realistic prediction of the steady state behavior. In the study of steady state performance of the SRM drive, the converter is approximated by a controlled, square wave pulse generator. In the integration process, the coefficients of the governing differential equation, being dependent on the phase current and rotor angle, are updated using surface interpolation method on the static characteristics. The predicted steady state characteristics compare favorable with the experimental results over a wide range of torque/speed variation. ...|$|R
40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers {{insight into}} screw {{compressor}} designs beyond {{the capabilities of}} other conventional methods. It allows evaluation of local flow patterns which influence performance but are difficult or impossible to investigate experimentally. Implementation of CFD in these machines is challenging due to the physics of the flow, {{the properties of the}} working fluids and the complexity of flow passages which change size and position. This is additionally challenged by a lack of methodologies available to generate the meshes required for the full three dimensional transient simulations. Commercially available CFD solvers need to fully interact with customized grid generators to enable resolution of grid deformation during a flow solution. However, the factors that influence flow predictions are not only related to grids but also to the approach which CFD solvers use to calculate distribution of parameters such as pressure, velocities, temperatures, etc. In this paper, two approaches most commonly used in commercial CFD software are compared and analysed. The first is a segregated cell-centre based solver and the second is a coupled vertex-centre based solver. Both are pressure based finite volume solvers. Customized grid generation software is used for <b>meshing</b> of moving <b>rotors</b> and flow domains around the rotors in an oil free air screw compressor with ‘N’ rotor profile of 3 / 5 lobe combination. The deforming rotor grid is maintained as identical in both solvers. The performance predictions obtained by calculations with these two CFD models are compared with measurements obtained on the test compressor in the City University London test rig. The comparison includes pressure in the compressor chamber, mass flow rate, indicated power and the volumetric efficiency. The study reveals differences between the results obtained by two different solvers and the experimental results. Analysis presented in this paper provides a good basis for further consideration of differencing schemes and other characteristics and settings for different CFD solvers in order to achieve accurate predictions of flows in positive displacement machines...|$|R
