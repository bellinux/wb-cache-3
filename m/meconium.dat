25|$|In the 19th century, Carl von Rokitansky {{described}} {{a case of}} fetal death with <b>meconium</b> peritonitis, a complication of <b>meconium</b> ileus associated with CF. <b>Meconium</b> ileus was first described in 1905 by Karl Landsteiner. In 1936, Guido Fanconi {{described a}} connection between celiac disease, cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, and bronchiectasis.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{prenatal}} and newborn screening, {{cystic fibrosis}} was often diagnosed when a newborn infant {{failed to pass}} feces (<b>meconium).</b> <b>Meconium</b> may completely block the intestines and cause serious illness. This condition, called <b>meconium</b> ileus, occurs in 5–10% of newborns with CF. In addition, protrusion of internal rectal membranes (rectal prolapse) is more common, occurring {{in as many as}} 10% of children with CF, and it is caused by increased fecal volume, malnutrition, and increased intra–abdominal pressure due to coughing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Meconium,</b> or {{the first}} feces {{produced}} by the foal, is a hard pelleted substance. It is normally passed within the first 24 hours of the foal's life, but may become impacted in the distal colon or rectum. <b>Meconium</b> impaction is most commonly is seen in foals 1–5 days of age, and {{is more common in}} miniature foals and in colts more than fillies (possibly because fillies have a wider pelvis). Foals will stop suckling, strain to defecate (presents as an arched back and lifted tail), and may start showing overt signs of colic such as rolling and getting up and down. In later stages, the abdomen will distend as it continues to fill with gas and feces. <b>Meconium</b> impactions are often diagnosed by clinical signs, but digital examination to feel for impacted <b>meconium,</b> radiographs, and ultrasound may also be used.|$|E
25|$|Treatment for <b>meconium</b> {{impaction}} typically {{involves the}} use of enemas, although persistent cases may require mineral oil or IV fluids. It is possible to tell that the <b>meconium</b> has passed when the foal begins to produce a softer, more yellow manure. Although <b>meconium</b> impactions rarely cause perforation, and are usually not life-threatening, foals are at risk of dehydration and may not get adequate levels of IgG due to decreased suckling and not enough ingestion of colostrum. Additionally, the foals will eventually bloat, and will require surgical intervention. Surgery in a foal can be especially risky due to immature immune system and low levels of ingested colostrum.|$|E
25|$|Healthy foals pass <b>meconium,</b> {{the first}} stool, soon after birth, though some healthy foals may require an enema to assist this process, but the <b>meconium</b> of LWS foals is {{impacted}} {{high in the}} intestine, and never appears, even {{with the use of}} enemas. Signs of colic begin to appear within the first day, and all LWS-afflicted foals die within {{the first few days of}} life. The painful and inevitable death that follows usually prompts veterinarians and owners to euthanize foals suspected of having lethal white syndrome.|$|E
25|$|They {{are able}} to provide {{resuscitative}} care to stillborn infants including intubation, defibrillation, suctioning of the airway, oxygen administration, <b>meconium</b> suctioning, IV fluid administration and administration of cardiac and respiratory medications.|$|E
25|$|In babies {{that are}} born at term risk factors include {{problems}} with the placenta, birth defects, low birth weight, breathing <b>meconium</b> into the lungs, a delivery requiring either the use of instruments or an emergency Caesarean section, birth asphyxia, seizures just after birth, respiratory distress syndrome, low blood sugar, and infections in the baby.|$|E
25|$|Lethal white syndrome, or ileocolonic aganglionosis, {{will result}} in <b>meconium</b> {{impaction}} since the foal does not have adequate nerve innervation to the large intestine, in essence, a nonfunctioning colon. Foals that are homozygous for the frame overo gene, often seen in Paint horse heritage, will develop the condition. They present with signs of colic within the first 12 hours after birth, and die within 48 hours due to constipation. This syndrome is not treatable.|$|E
25|$|Atresia coli and atresia ani {{can also}} present as <b>meconium</b> impaction. The foal is missing the lumen of its distal colon or anus, respectively, and usually {{show signs of}} colic within 12–24 hours. Atresia coli is usually {{diagnosed}} with barium contrast studies, in which foals are given barium, and then radiographed to see if and where the barium is trapped. Atresia ani is simply diagnosed with digital examination by a veterinarian. Both situations requires emergency surgery to prevent death, and often still has a poor prognosis for survival with surgical correction.|$|E
25|$|P. exigua nests {{are white}} or light brown and exhibit domed, paper {{envelopes}}. These fibrous envelopes {{cover the entire}} comb. The comb is suspended from a leaf or branch {{by one or more}} peduncles, with an exit-hole on the side or bottom of the envelope. The nests are also observed to provide many entrance holes, which seem to be a unique feature to the species. On average, there are 1.7 combs and 566 cells per colony. While P. exigua nests typically have one comb, additional combs are sometimes found on certain nests. Cells with brown wafers of <b>meconium</b> towards the bottom indicate that there has been an emergence of new larvae; this discoloration {{is the result of the}} larva shedding its waste products during pupation. P. exigua tend to build their nests in locations facing west; it is suggested that this specific placement leads to higher environmental temperatures and proportionally greater foraging activity.|$|E
25|$|Small colon impactions {{represent}} {{a small number}} of colics in the horse, and are usually caused by obstruction from fecaliths, enteroliths, and <b>meconium.</b> Horses usually present with standard colic signs (pawing, flank watching, rolling) in 82% of horses, and occasionally with diarrhea (31%), anorexia (30%), straining (12%), and depression (11%), and rectal examination will reveal firm loops of small colon or actually palpable obstruction in the rectum. Impactions are most common in miniature horses, possibly because they do not masticate their feed as well, and during the fall and winter. Medical management includes the aggressive use of fluids, laxatives and lubricants, and enemas, as well as analgesics and anti-inflammatories. However, these impactions often require surgical intervention, and the surgeon will empty the colon either by enterotomy or by lubricants and massage. Surgical intervention usually results in longer recovery time at the hospital. Prognosis is very good, and horses treated with surgical treatment had a survival with return to athletic function rate of 91%, while 89% of the medically managed horses returned to previous use.|$|E
500|$|The antlion larva has {{a robust}} [...] body, a very plump abdomen, and a thorax bearing {{three pairs of}} walking legs. The {{prothorax}} forms a slender mobile [...] "neck" [...] for the large, square, flattened head, which bears an enormous pair of sickle-like jaws with several sharp, hollow projections. The jaws are formed by the maxillae and mandibles; the mandibles each contain a deep groove over which the maxilla fits neatly, forming an enclosed canal for injecting venom to immobilise the victim, and enzymes to digest its soft parts. The larva is clad in forward-pointing bristles which help it to anchor itself and exert greater traction, enabling it to subdue prey considerably larger than itself. Antlion larvae are unusual among insects in lacking an anus. All the metabolic waste generated during the larval stage is stored; some is used to spin the silk for the cocoon {{and the rest is}} eventually voided as <b>meconium</b> {{at the end of its}} pupal stage.|$|E
2500|$|Activation of trypsin from {{proteolytic}} cleavage of trypsinogen in {{the pancreas}} {{can lead to}} a series of events that cause pancreatic self-digestion, resulting in pancreatitis. [...] One consequence of the autosomal recessive disease cystic fibrosis is a deficiency in transport of trypsin and other digestive enzymes from the pancreas. [...] This leads to the disorder termed <b>meconium</b> ileus. This disorder involves intestinal obstruction (ileus) due to overly thick <b>meconium,</b> which is normally broken down by trypsin and other proteases, then passed in feces.|$|E
2500|$|After birth, a foal's navel is {{dipped in}} {{antiseptic}} to prevent infection, {{it is sometimes}} given an enema to help clear the <b>meconium</b> from its digestive tract, and the newborn is monitored {{to ensure that it}} stands and nurses without difficulty. [...] While most horse births happen without complications, many owners have first aid supplies prepared and a veterinarian on call in case of a birthing emergency. [...] People who supervise foaling should also watch the mare to be sure that she passes the placenta in a timely fashion, and that it is complete with no fragments remaining in the uterus, where retained fetal membranes could cause a serious inflammatory condition (endometritis) and/or infection. [...] If the placenta is not removed from the stall after it is passed, a mare will often eat it, an instinct from the wild, where blood would attract predators.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of cystic fibrosis are salty-tasting skin, poor growth, and poor weight gain despite normal food intake, accumulation of thick, sticky mucus, frequent chest infections, and coughing or shortness of breath. Males can be infertile due to congenital absence of the vas deferens. Symptoms often appear in infancy and childhood, such as bowel obstruction due to <b>meconium</b> ileus in newborn babies. As the children grow, they [...] exercise to release mucus in the alveoli. Ciliated epithelial cells in the person have a mutated protein that leads to abnormally viscous mucus production. The poor growth in children typically presents as an inability to gain weight or height {{at the same rate as}} their peers, and is occasionally not diagnosed until investigation is initiated for poor growth. The causes of growth failure are multifactorial and include chronic lung infection, poor absorption of nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract, and increased metabolic demand due to chronic illness.|$|E
2500|$|The Hemipepsis cocoon is a brown silk structure. It is {{slightly}} wider {{at the end}} from which the wasp will emerge. The inner wall is varnished, {{but there is no}} inner cocoon. [...] It takes several hours to complete, {{and at the end of}} it, the grub evacuates its alimentary canal; this <b>meconium,</b> or first stool, becomes a hardened mass at the end of the cocoon. The grub is much smaller than it was at the end of feeding because it has expended so much body content on spinning the cocoon and voiding its alimentary canal. The cocoon turns a greasy amber yellow from the original silky gray. The time of hatching is dependent on the season. A cocoon formed early in the summer may hatch the same summer, however a late summer or autumn brood may remain in cocoon form until the following spring or summer. Once the grub reaches pupa stage, the grub lies extended and quiet. The head capsule splits along the midline and a glassy, whitish pupa forces its way out of the discarded, shriveling larval skin. The pupa turns creamy yellow, with gray-blue large compound eyes showing through the thin integument. One can also see the antenna, stubby wing pads, and back spines.|$|E
2500|$|Cocaine {{use during}} {{pregnancy}} can be discovered {{by asking the}} mother, but sometimes women will not admit to having used drugs. Mothers may lie for fear of prosecution or having their children taken away, but {{even when they are}} willing to tell the truth their memories may not be very accurate. It may also not be possible to be sure of the purity of the drug they have taken. More reliable methods for detecting cocaine exposure involve testing the newborn's hair or <b>meconium</b> (the infant's earliest stool). Hair analysis, however, can give false positives for cocaine exposure, and a newborn may not have enough hair to test. The newborn's urine can be tested for cocaine and metabolites, but it must be collected as soon as possible after birth. It is not known how long after exposure the markers will still show up in a newborn's urine. [...] The mother's urine can also be tested for drugs, but it cannot detect drugs used too far in the past or determine how much or how often the drugs were used. Tests cannot generally detect cocaine use over a week prior to sample collection. Mothers are more honest about cocaine use when their urine is also tested, but many users still deny it. Both maternal and neonatal urine tests can give false negatives.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lifecycle}} of a V. rufa colony {{begins in}} the fall as queens [...] "leave their home colony and, after fertilization, enter over-wintering sites. In early spring the queens emerge from hibernation {{to look for a}} nesting cavity. The nest is usually constructed underground in an abandoned rodent burrow or similar cavity, more rarely in cavities above ground (hollow stumps, wall cavities, and bird boxes), under moss, in dense bushes, under eaves of houses or in attics. The queen commences the process by building the [...] "queen nest" [...] and helping to raise the first workers, such that these workers can begin to forage, engage in [...] "nest-building and brood rearing activities," [...] rather than the queen. In the meantime, the queen can lay eggs. The queens and workers overlap in foraging for at least two days in [...] "one colony and three days in another." [...] The burden of feeding the larvae and enlarging the nest is on the workers. Colony expansion continue rapidly, with thousands of workers being produced in a large nest in approximately a 9-week period. Eggs that are laid in the cells hatch to become larvae. When the last larval stage is near its end, [...] "the gut contents are evacuated to form the <b>meconium</b> {{at the bottom of the}} cell." [...] The larva spins a cocoon, thereby entering the pupal stage.|$|E
2500|$|Newborns {{have very}} {{immature}} and small [...] digestive systems, and colostrum delivers its nutrients {{in a very}} concentrated low-volume form. It has a mild laxative effect, encouraging {{the passing of the}} baby's first stool, which is called <b>meconium.</b> [...] This clears excess bilirubin, a waste-product of dead red blood cells, which is produced in large quantities at birth due to blood volume reduction from the infant's body and helps prevent jaundice. Colostrum is known to contain immune cells (as lymphocytes) and many antibodies such as IgA, [...] IgG, and IgM. [...] These are some of the components of the adaptive immune system. [...] In preterm infants some IgA may be absorbed through the intestinal epithelium and enter the blood stream though there is very little uptake in full term babies. [...] This is due to the early [...] "closure" [...] of the intestinal epithelium to large molecule uptake in humans unlike the case in cattle which continue to uptake immunoglobulin from milk shortly after birth. [...] Other immune components of colostrum include the major components of the innate immune system, such as lactoferrin, lysozyme, lactoperoxidase, complement, and proline-rich polypeptides (PRP). A number of cytokines (small messenger peptides that control the functioning of the immune system) are found in colostrum as well, including interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, chemokines, and others. Colostrum also contains a number of growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factors I (IGF-1), and II, transforming growth factors alpha, beta 1 and beta 2, fibroblast growth factors, epidermal growth factor, granulocyte-macrophage-stimulating growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and colony-stimulating factor-1.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meconium</b> ileus {{should be}} {{distinguished}} from <b>meconium</b> plug syndrome, in which a tenacious mass of mucus prevents the <b>meconium</b> from passing {{and there is no}} risk of intestinal perforation. <b>Meconium</b> ileus has a significant risk of intestinal perforation. In barium enema, <b>meconium</b> plug syndrome rather shows normal or dilated colon as compared to micro-colon in <b>meconium</b> ileus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meconium</b> {{aspiration}} syndrome (MAS) {{also known}} as neonatal aspiration of <b>meconium</b> is a medical condition affecting newborn infants. It occurs when <b>meconium</b> is present in their lungs during or before delivery. <b>Meconium</b> is the first stool of an infant, composed of materials ingested during the time the infant spends in the uterus.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the time}} that the amniotic fluid is stained with <b>meconium</b> it will be {{homogeneously}} distributed throughout the fluid making it brown. This indicates that the fetus passed the <b>meconium</b> some time ago such that sufficient mixing occurred as to establish the homogeneous mixture. Terminal <b>meconium</b> occurs when the fetus passes the <b>meconium</b> a short enough time before birth/caesarean section that the amniotic fluid remains clear, but individual clumps of <b>meconium</b> are in the fluid.|$|E
50|$|The <b>meconium</b> {{sometimes}} becomes thickened and congested in the intestines, {{a condition}} known as <b>meconium</b> ileus. <b>Meconium</b> ileus {{is often the}} first sign of cystic fibrosis. In cystic fibrosis, the <b>meconium</b> can form a bituminous black-green mechanical obstruction in a segment of the ileum. Beyond this there may be a few separate grey-white globular pellets. Below this level, the bowel is a narrow and empty micro-colon. Above the level of the obstruction, there are several loops of hypertrophied bowel distended with fluid. No <b>meconium</b> is passed, and abdominal distension and vomiting appear soon after birth. About 20% of cases of cystic fibrosis present with <b>meconium</b> ileus, while approximately 20% of one series of cases of <b>meconium</b> ileus did not have cystic fibrosis. The presence of <b>meconium</b> ileus is not related to the severity of the cystic fibrosis. The obstruction can be relieved {{in a number of different}} ways.|$|E
50|$|Fetal {{distress}} during labor causes intestinal contractions, {{as well as}} {{relaxation of}} the anal sphincter, which allows <b>meconium</b> to pass into the amniotic fluid and contaminate the amniotic fluid. <b>Meconium</b> passage into the amniotic fluid occurs in about 5-20 percent of all births and {{is more common in}} overdue births. Of the cases where <b>meconium</b> is found in the amniotic fluid, <b>meconium</b> aspiration syndrome develops less than 5 percent of the time. Amniotic fluid is normally clear, but becomes greenish if it is tinted with <b>meconium.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Meconium</b> {{peritonitis}} {{refers to}} rupture of the bowel prior to birth, resulting in fetal stool (<b>meconium)</b> escaping {{into the surrounding}} space (peritoneum) leading to inflammation (peritonitis). Despite the bowel rupture, many infants born after <b>meconium</b> peritonitis in utero have normal bowels and have no further issues.|$|E
50|$|A low {{obstruction}} {{is suspected}} on plain film, but needs {{follow up with}} a gastrografin enema, which itself can be therapeutic. The differential for low obstruction is ileal atresia, <b>meconium</b> ileus, <b>meconium</b> plug syndrome and Hirschsprung disease. In cases of <b>meconium</b> ileus or ileal atresia, the colon distal to the obstruction is hypoplastic, usually less than 1 cm in caliber, as development of normal colonic caliber in utero {{is due to the}} passage of <b>meconium,</b> which does not occur in either of these conditions. When diffusely small caliber is seen, it is referred to as microcolon. Radiographs in <b>meconium</b> ileus classically demonstrate a bubbly appearance in the right lower quadrant due to a combination of ingested air and <b>meconium.</b> If, on contrast enema, reflux into the dilated distal small bowel loops can be achieved, the study is both diagnostic and therapeutic, as the ionic contrast medium can dissolve the <b>meconium</b> to allow passage of enteric content into the unused colon.|$|E

50|$|<b>Meconium</b> is {{a sticky}} {{substance}} that usually {{makes up the}} child’s first bowel movement. If the fetus is stressed before or during delivery, the <b>meconium</b> may be released and may mix with the amniotic fluid. If it gets into the child’s airways or lungs, it can cause <b>meconium</b> aspiration syndrome. Serious cases may result in pneumonia or a collapsed lung.|$|E
50|$|Investigations into reproductive-associated microbiomes began around 1885 by Theodor Escherich. He {{wrote that}} <b>meconium</b> from the newborn {{was free of}} bacteria. This was {{interpreted}} as the uterine environment was sterile. Other investigations used sterile diapers for <b>meconium</b> collection. No bacteria were able to be cultured from the samples. Bacteria were detected and were directly proportional to the time between birth and the passage of <b>meconium.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Meconium</b> is {{normally}} {{retained in the}} infant's bowel until after birth, but sometimes it is expelled into the amniotic fluid (also called [...] "amniotic liquor") prior to birth or during labor and delivery. The stained amniotic fluid (called [...] "meconium liquor" [...] or [...] "meconium stained liquor") is recognised by medical staff {{that this may be}} a sign of fetal distress. Some post-dates pregnancies (where the woman is more than 40 weeks pregnant) may also have <b>meconium</b> stained liquor without fetal distress. Medical staff may aspirate the <b>meconium</b> from the nose and mouth of a newborn immediately after delivery in the event the baby shows signs of respiratory distress to decrease the risk of <b>meconium</b> aspiration syndrome.|$|E

Using <b>meconium,</b> a Canadian {{research}} group at the Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, showed that by measuring a by-product of alcohol (FAEE) they could objectively detect babies exposed to excessive maternal drinking of alcohol in pregnancy. [...] In the USA, the results of <b>meconium</b> testing may be used by child protective services and other law enforcement agencies to determine the eligibility of the parents to keep the newborn.|$|E
