25|$|The Arrow <b>Model</b> <b>F</b> or the Arrow Sport V-8 was a two-seat low-wing braced {{monoplane}} aircraft {{built in}} the United States between 1934 and 1938. It was built originally to a request by the US Bureau of Air Commerce to investigate the feasibility of using automobile engines to power aircraft. Accordingly, the <b>Model</b> <b>F</b> was fitted with a modified Ford V8 engine. Like the Arrow Sport before it, the <b>Model</b> <b>F</b> seated its pilot and passenger side-by-side in an open cockpit and was marketed for $1500.|$|E

25|$|The Fordson Model N {{replaced}} the Fordson <b>Model</b> <b>F.</b> It was an improved {{variant of the}} F. Production of the Model N started in Cork in 1927. Production of the Fordson Model N was transferred from Cork to Dagenham in 1933. The Model N featured a 27 HP engine, standard rear fenders (mudguards), a higher voltage ignition system, and optional pneumatic tires. In 1935 power take-off (PTO) was available as an option on the Model N.|$|E
25|$|The Model M was {{designed}} to be more cost effective than the <b>Model</b> <b>F</b> keyboards it replaced. Production of Model M's began in 1985; they were often bundled with new IBM computers. They were produced at IBM plants in Lexington; Greenock, Scotland and Guadalajara, Mexico. The most common Model M variant is the part number 1391401, the US English layout keyboard of the IBM PS/2. Until around 1993, most Model M's included a sturdy, coiled, detachable cable, with either an AT (pre-1987) or PS/2 connector, in 5- and 10-foot lengths (1.5 and 3 metres). From about 1994 onwards, flat non-detachable cables were used to reduce manufacturing costs; however, IBM retained its 101-key layout, never implementing the Microsoft Windows keys common on other keyboards from that time. Unicomp later designed a 104-key Model M with Windows keys.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the Framework for {{building}} Failure Prediction <b>Models</b> (<b>F</b> 2 PM), a Machine Learning-based Framework to build models for predicting the Remaining Time to Failure (RTTF) of {{applications in the}} presence of software anomalies. F 2 PM uses measurements of a number of system features {{in order to create a}} knowledge base, which is then used to build prediction <b>models.</b> <b>F</b> 2 PM is application-independent, i. e. It solely exploits measurements of system-level features. Thus, it can be used in differentiated contexts, without the need for any manual modification or intervention to the running applications. To generate optimized <b>models,</b> <b>F</b> 2 PM can perform a feature selection to identify, among all the measured system features, which have a major impact in the prediction of the RTTF. This allows to produce different models, which use different set of input features. Generated models can be compared by the user by using a set of metrics produced by F 2 PM, which are related to the model prediction accuracy, as well as to the model building time. We also present experimental results of a successful application of F 2 PM, using the standard TPC-W e-commerce benchmark...|$|R

2500|$|In 1914, the Curtiss Aeroplane Company {{developed}} its Model K, {{an enlarged}} development of its successful <b>Model</b> <b>F</b> flying boat. [...] It was a three-bay biplane {{powered by a}} 150hp (112kW) Curtiss V-X engine mounted in a pusher configuration between the wings.

2500|$|The Fordson <b>Model</b> <b>F</b> was {{not without}} flaws it shared with other brands.

2500|$|Under {{the same}} {{assumptions}} {{as for a}} standard logit (<b>model</b> <b>F),</b> the probability for a ranking of the alternatives {{is a product of}} standard logits. The model is called [...] "exploded logit" [...] because the choice situation that is usually represented as one logit formula for the chosen alternative is expanded ("exploded") to have a separate logit formula for each ranked alternative. The exploded logit model is the product of standard logit models with the choice set decreasing as each alternative is ranked and leaves the set of available choices in the subsequent choice.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper <b>models</b> <b>F</b> 0 curves with {{discrete}} cosine transform (DCT) representations on both syllable-level {{tone and}} phrase-level intonation for Chinese Mandarin speech. Decision trees growing with maximum likelihood (ML) and stopping with minimum description length (MDL) {{are used to}} cluster very rich context-dependent DCT models into generalized ones to predict unseen contexts in test robustly. Additionally, we propose to generate Mandarin tone contours by jointly optimizing F 0 contours of syllable and phrase in ML sense. Experimental results on speaker-dependent continuous and speakerindependent isolated speech corpora show that the proposed approach can be able to generate F 0 contour with high h correlation coefficients of 0. 92 and 0. 82 respectively, measured ured between the original and generated F 0.
