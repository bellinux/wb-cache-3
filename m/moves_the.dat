5|$|Once the arc is struck, the welder <b>moves</b> <b>the</b> torch in a {{small circle}} to create a welding pool, the size of which depends {{on the size of}} the {{electrode}} and the amount of current. While maintaining a constant separation between the electrode and the workpiece, the operator then <b>moves</b> <b>the</b> torch back slightly and tilts it backward about 10–15 degrees from vertical. Filler metal is added manually to the front end of the weld pool as it is needed.|$|E

5|$|In {{commemoration}} of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom, a novelty pancake machine {{was built by}} The Happy Egg Company in February 2013 that involved a complex series of steps to automatically produce pancakes from scratch. The machine {{involves the use of}} a freshly laid egg from a hen that rolls onto a turntable, which then <b>moves</b> <b>the</b> egg to an area where it is automatically cracked and mixed with other ingredients. After this point, the mixture is poured into a griddle, flipped to cook the other side, and then flipped onto a plate.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{displayed}} on a black-and-white television screen, and the tanks are controlled by two joysticks each. Pushing both joysticks <b>moves</b> <b>the</b> player's tank forward, and pulling them both back causes the tank to stop. Pulling them in different directions or amounts causes the tank to turn in place or while moving, respectively. A button {{on the top of}} the right joystick fires a shell.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{seen from}} a {{top-down}} perspective, and focuses on sword combat. The player <b>moves</b> <b>the</b> hero through the game world, which is divided into several areas; as the player enters one, enemy characters start to appear there. Among the areas in the game world, there are dungeons that the player needs to get through. These usually consist {{of a number of}} rooms divided across three to four floors; in order to navigate their way through a dungeon, the player needs to break walls, unlock doors, and sometimes press down buttons and break pots.|$|E
50|$|In this diagram, with Black to <b>move,</b> <b>the</b> black queen is {{skewered}} by White's bishop. To avoid {{capture of}} the queen, Black must <b>move</b> <b>the</b> queen, and on <b>the</b> next <b>move,</b> White can capture the rook. This is a relative skewer; Black is likely to <b>move</b> <b>the</b> queen, which is more valuable than the rook—but the choice is still available.|$|R

First, <b>move</b> <b>the</b> Pawn in front of the Queen forward; then <b>move</b> <b>the</b> Queen to the blank square the pawn has just vacated, so <b>the</b> Queen <b>moves</b> two squares.|$|R
5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the throttle levers to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform a go-around, he <b>moves</b> <b>the</b> thrust levers forward to a positive position again and that will produce forward thrust, enabling the pilot to execute a go-around maneuver.|$|E
5|$|Tiller {{effect is}} the {{expression}} {{used to describe}} how handlebars that extend far behind the steering axis (head tube) act like a tiller on a boat, in that one <b>moves</b> <b>the</b> bars to the right in order to turn the front wheel to the left, and vice versa. This situation is commonly found on cruiser bicycles, some recumbents, and some motorcycles. It can be troublesome when it limits the ability to steer because of interference or the limits of arm reach.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements {{in which a}} horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and training of the horse, and terrain and footing. The proportions and length of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse <b>moves.</b> <b>The</b> angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E

5|$|After birth, {{the mother}} cleans the cubs, and can then {{recognize}} each by its smell. At first, she spends 60% to 90% {{of her time}} with the cubs. After the first week, the mother starts spending more time outside the nest, returning every few hours to nurse and groom the cubs. She <b>moves</b> <b>the</b> young frequently among several nests, all of which she keeps clean. The cubs start to open their eyes at about 18 days of age. By about 90 days, they have achieved full adult fur and coloring, and begin to venture out of the nest. They also start eating solid foods at this point, weaning at around six to eight months of age. The cubs stay with their mother until the next litter is born in the following summer. Males rarely help raise the young, and only if they live in pairs or in small groups.|$|E
5|$|After {{the pilot}} docks with {{a space station}} or lands on a planet, the screen and its {{interface}} change to a rendition of the area he is visiting.

Freelancers economy consists of buying and selling spacecraft, their armaments and components, and commodities. Certain goods are considered contraband in some systems, {{and they have to}} be smuggled past police patrols to their buyers. Computer-controlled characters (non-player characters or NPCs) in certain locations on the planets or stations offer quests and jobs.|$|E

5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or <b>moves</b> <b>the</b> team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E
5|$|Around the planisphere <b>moves</b> <b>the</b> rete, a {{web-like}} metal cutout {{representing the}} zodiac, which {{also features a}} Julian calendar dial. Above the rete, a display indicates {{the day of the}} week. Because leap days are not supported by the clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each leap year on 29 February. A moon dial circles the inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the moon phase. The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the retes calendar dial. The larger one circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence {{has several}} {{functions}} in different taxa. Haddock et al. (2010) list as {{more or less}} definite functions in marine organisms the following: defensive functions of startle, counterillumination (camouflage), misdirection (smoke screen), distractive body parts, burglar alarm (making predators easier for higher predators to see), and warning to deter settlers; offensive functions of lure, stun or confuse prey, illuminate prey, and mate attraction/recognition. It is much easier for researchers to detect that a species is able to produce light than to analyse the chemical mechanisms or to prove what function the light serves. In some cases the function is unknown, as with species in three families of earthworm (Oligochaeta), such as Diplocardia longa where the coelomic fluid produces light when the animal <b>moves.</b> <b>The</b> following functions are reasonably well established in the named organisms.|$|E
