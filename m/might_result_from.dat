5|$|The moths migrate in {{response}} {{to changes in the}} host plants. Chrysiridia larvae defoliate the whole plant, and even eat the flowers and fruit, and thus have a considerable negative impact on the reproduction and survival of seedlings. The plants probably react by changing their nutrient and secondary compound levels, becoming toxic to the larvae and causing high mortality. Omphalea populations that are not damaged by moths {{for long periods of time}} have lower toxicity. These factors cause mass increases in local population, followed by sudden crashes. The population crashes <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> increased larval mortality, but are more likely caused by the emigration of the adult moths. Through semiochemicals, the plant may recruit hymenopteran parasitoids as a protection, hence playing a role in the population dynamics of the moth.|$|E

25|$|The {{morphology}} and kinematics of lenticular galaxies each, to a degree, {{suggest a}} mode of galaxy formation. Their disk-like, possibly dusty, appearance suggests they come from faded spiral galaxies, whose arm features disappeared. Alternatively, as lenticular galaxies {{are likely to be}} more luminous than spiral galaxies, which suggests that they are not merely the faded remnants of spiral galaxies. Rather, lenticular galaxies <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> galaxy merger, which increase the total stellar mass and give the newly merged galaxy its disk-like, arm-less appearance.|$|E
25|$|Another {{description}} {{applies to}} the Hui people of Yunnan and Northwestern China, whose origin <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> the convergence of Mongol, Turkic, Iranian or other Central Asian settlers who were recruited by the Yuan Dynasty either as officials (the semu), who formed the second-highest stratum in the Yuan ethnic hierarchy (after the Mongols but above Chinese) or artisans. A proportion of the ancestral nomad or military ethnic groups were originally Nestorian Christians, many of whom later converted to Islam under the Ming and Qing Dynasties.|$|E

25|$|Some {{soft drinks}} contain {{measurable}} amounts of alcohol. In some older preparations, this resulted from natural fermentation {{used to build}} the carbonation. In the United States, soft drinks (as well as other beverages such as non-alcoholic beer) are allowed by law to contain up to 0.5% alcohol by volume. Modern drinks introduce carbon dioxide for carbonation, {{but there is some}} speculation that alcohol <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> fermentation of sugars in a non-sterile environment. A small amount of alcohol is introduced in some soft drinks where alcohol is used in the preparation of the flavoring extracts such as vanilla extract.|$|E
25|$|Physical process {{models of}} {{complete}} drainage basins {{are even more}} complex. Although many processes are well understood at a point or for a small area, others are poorly understood at all scales, and process interactions under normal or extreme climatic conditions may be unknown. Basin models typically combine land-surface process components (to estimate how much rainfall or snowmelt reaches a channel) {{with a series of}} reach models. For example, a basin model can calculate the runoff hydrograph that <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> a 100-year storm, although the recurrence interval of a storm is rarely equal to that of the associated flood. Basin models are commonly used in flood forecasting and warning, as well as in analysis of the effects of land use change and climate change.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1950s, {{a number}} of writers and social {{commentators}} have speculated in some depth about {{the social and cultural}} changes that <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> the advent of commercially affordable additive manufacturing technology. Amongst the more notable ideas to have emerged from these inquiries has been the suggestion that, as more and more 3D printers start to enter people's homes, the conventional relationship between the home and the workplace might get further eroded. Likewise, it has also been suggested that, as it becomes easier for businesses to transmit designs for new objects around the globe, so the need for high-speed freight services might also become less. Finally, given the ease with which certain objects can now be replicated, {{it remains to be seen}} whether changes will be made to current copyright legislation so as to protect intellectual property rights with the new technology widely available.|$|E

25|$|Arcuate and radial lineaments that <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> tectonic {{adjustments}} of the Mercurian crust, following {{excavation of}} very large multiring impact basins {{such as the}} one postulated under Borealis Planitia (Boyce and Grolier, 1977), were not unambiguously identified in the Borealis region. On one hand, some ridges {{on the surface of the}} smooth plains material in Borealis Planitia may be of structural (internal) origin; this type of ridge elsewhere on Mercury has been ascribed to compression and a slight shortening of the crust (Melosh, 1977; Melosh and Dzurisin, 1978). On the other hand, the wrinklelike sinuous ridge along the northeast border of the Goethe Basin, together with the outward-facing concentric scarps along its periphery, may represent the fronts of lava flows that are associated with the development of a structural moat between the basin fill and the wall. The latter interpretation supports the view that impact craters and basins on Mercury, as on the Moon (Schultz, 1977) and Mars, “have played a dominant role in controlling the surface expression of igneous activity” (Schultz and Glicken, 1979, p. 8033). Slow, long-lasting isostatic adjustment of the basin floor may have continued well after the emplacement of the basin fill, a structural situation similar to that of crater Posidonius on the Moon (Schaber and others, 1977, Schultz, 1977).|$|E

500|$|Adams {{returned}} to Boston in 1779 {{to attend a}} state constitutional convention. The Massachusetts General Court had proposed a new constitution the previous year, but voters rejected it, and so a convention was held to try again. Adams was appointed to a three-man drafting committee with his cousin John Adams and James Bowdoin. They drafted the Massachusetts Constitution, which was amended by the convention and approved by voters in 1780. The new constitution established a republican form of government, with annual elections and a separation of powers. It reflected Adams's belief that [...] "a state is never free except when each citizen is bound by no law whatever {{that he has not}} approved of, either directly, or through his representatives". By modern standards, the new constitution was not [...] "democratic"; Adams, like most of his peers, believed that only free males who owned property should be allowed to vote, and that the senate and the governor served to balance any excesses that <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> majority rule.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the tomb}} was clearly {{disturbed}} in antiquity (see below), and although its contents {{have been described}} as disorded and chaotic, (Kegan Paul, 1990) p. 43 Martha Bell argued that this disarray was more apparent than real. Her reconstruction of the layout of the tomb indicates an orderly and deliberate arrangement of artefacts, and she suggests that the impression of chaos might be due to the collapse of wooden objects caused by falling plaster and stone. The [...] "cemented" [...] chips and stains in the corridor indicate that water entered the tomb along the corridor ceiling, but the amount of water might not have been great, and most damage could have been caused by increased humidity rather than direct contact with water. Bell also suggested that the moisture under the mummy might have resulted from rainfall shortly after the tomb's opening in 1907. Other damage to wooden objects <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> an insect attack.|$|E
2500|$|Bergmann's rule {{establishes}} {{that among}} endothermic animals {{of the same}} species, body size increases with latitude. [...] Studies have tested whether this rule also applies to social insects. [...] L. acervorum workers were counted {{in a sample of}} colonies from Erlangen and Karelia. [...] The worker size was significantly larger in the Karelian population, with the average thorax length being 1.15mm ± 0.07mm. [...] The average thorax length from the Erlangen population was 1.08 ± 0.05mm. [...] As evidenced, the workers from Karelia were on average 10% larger than the workers from Erlangen. The results suggest that larger body sizes in L. acervorum from boreal habitats <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> selection for increased fasting endurance. [...] Larger workers had more fat than small workers, and would survive longer in colder environments. [...] Leptothorax acervorum might extend their survival time in areas with long winters and unpredictable climate by storing more reserves. [...] Thus, the body size of workers of this holarctic ant increases with latitude.|$|E

2500|$|Two Russian men she met {{commented on}} her general {{disdain for the}} male sex; irritated by their {{assumption}} that since she was always falling in love, she would return their affections if they flirted with her, Clairmont joked {{in a letter to}} Mary Shelley that perhaps she should fall in love with both of them at once and prove them wrong. She returned to England in 1828, but remained there only a short while before departing for Dresden, where she was employed as a companion and housekeeper. Scholar Bradford A.

From these contradictions I must conclude that the telegram disavowing Hoyos {who, on July 5/6 at Berlin, had spoken unofficially of Austria's partitioning of Serbia} was intended for the gallery, and that the Austrian Government is harboring plans which it sees fit to conceal from us, in order to assure itself in all events of German support and to avoid the refusal which <b>might</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> a frank statement." ...|$|E

30|$|Iron {{plays an}} {{important}} role in cells since it is essential in many processes such as oxygen storage and transport, photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and DNA synthesis. Importantly, cells have developed mechanisms to store the toxic iron ions which are not required for immediate metabolism and make them into a nontoxic form. As a protein sequestrating iron, the ferritin protein was measured in the present study. The level of ferritin protein was significantly induced by the SPIO nanoclusters in HepG 2 and NIH 3 T 3 cells, which was considered to be a response to keep iron hemostasis and cell survival [34, 35], while we did not observe ferritin expression in Raw 264.7 cells, which <b>might</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>from</b> any other cell defense systems, such as glutathione [36] or autophagy [37], to protect the cells from iron overload (Fig.  7). Nevertheless, these results indicate that ferritin protein might play a protective role when SPIO nanoclusters label cells.|$|R
