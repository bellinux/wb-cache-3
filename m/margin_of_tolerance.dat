For this reason, some allowance, or minimum difference, between the PDs {{of the internal}} and external threads has to generally be provided for, to eliminate the possibility of deviations from the ideal thread form causing interference and to expedite hand assembly up to the length of engagement. Such allowances, or fundamental deviations, as ISO standards call them, are provided for in various degrees in corresponding classes of fit for ranges of thread sizes. At one extreme, no allowance is provided by a class, but the maximum PD of the external thread is specified to be the same as the minimum PD of the internal thread, within specified tolerances, ensuring that the two can be assembled, with some looseness of fit still possible due to the <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance.</b> A class called interference fit may even provide for negative allowances, where the PD of the screw is greater than the PD of the nut by at least the amount of the allowance.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig. 1, the system {{analyzes}} IoT environmental sensors and power consumption analyzers, {{embedded in a}} SCADA system. In the case of environmental sensors, the system confronts the current values with the predefined rules, which indicate the ranges of values of each alarm level. These rules are also context dependent, since the read values may be normal under certain conditions (e.g., weather conditions and number of people). Each sensor can have particular rules depending on its location (e.g., a temperature sensor in a servers room has alarm triggers for lower temperatures than normal rooms, because the room must be kept cool). In relation to the consumption analyzers, the system confronts the current values with the consumption profile present in the data history for the context in matter. This profile allows to know the minimum and maximum consumption expected in this context, with a small <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> in order to ignore small variations that normally occur on a daily basis.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Convergence of {{resource}} allocation algorithms is well {{covered in the}} literature as convergence to a steady state is important due to stability and performance. However, research is lacking {{when it comes to}} the propagation of change that occur in a network due to new nodes arriving or old nodes leaving or updating their allocation. As change can propagate through the network in a manner similar to how domino pieces falls, we call this propagation of change the domino effect. In this paper we investigate how change at one node can affect other nodes for a simple power control algorithm. We provide analytical results from a deterministic network as well as a Poisson distributed network through percolation theory and provide simulation results that highlight some aspects of the domino effect. The difficulty of mitigating this domino effect lies in the fact that to avoid it, one needs to have a <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> for changes in the network. However, a high margin leads to poor system performance in a steady-state and therefore one has to consider a trade-off between performance and propagation of change. I...|$|E
40|$|A set of {{statistical}} indicators fit for air quality model evaluation is {{selected based on}} experience and literature: The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), the bias (Bias), the standard Deviation (SD) and the correlation factor (R) are selected. Among these the RMSE is proposed as the key one for {{the description of the}} model skill. Model Performance Criteria (MPC) to investigate whether a model results are ‘good enough’ for a given application are calculated based on the observation uncertainty (U). The basic concept is to allow for model results a similar <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> (in terms of uncertainty) as for observations. U is pollutant, concentration level and station dependent, therefore the proposed MPC are normalized by U. Some existing composite diagrams are adapted to visualize model performance in terms of the proposed MPC and are illustrated in a real modeling application. The Target diagram, used to visualize the RMSE, is adapted with a new normalization on its axis, while complementary diagrams are proposed. In this first application the dependence of U on concentrations level and station is ignored, and an assumption on the pollutant dependent relative error is made. The advantages of this new approach are finally described. JRC. H. 2 -Air and Climat...|$|E

40|$|In general, {{air quality}} is {{determined}} from {{the concentrations of}} pollutants in ambient air. Air quality criteria (limit and target values, <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerances,</b> upper and lower assessment thresholds) {{are based on the}} current legislative framework.

The article aims at applying suitable GIS tools in the assessment process of air quality in the Košice agglomeration for the selected period 2008 - 2010.

A significant part of this paper was devoted to the problems of putting a layer of nanotubes on the surface of an aluminum alloy. Obtaining a layer of nanotubes of a very narrow <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> was a difficult technological problem to overcome. A standard process of growing a layer of nanotubes leads to a corrosion damage of the side surface of pistons; therefore, new technologies were developed allowing for obtaining a permanent layer of nanotubes less than 5 microns thick.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the Human Rights Diplomacy (HRD) between the European Union (EU) and China and how it changed {{as a result of}} a two-way socialisation process. Through a conceptual inquiry, I show that in-built dilemmas of HRD legitimise two opposing beliefs in the appropriate role of values in diplomacy. A principled promotion of internal views of human rights (human rights script) or a pragmatic approach stressing the values of cooperation and peace (diplomacy script). Tracing EU-China HRD interactions in bilateral discourse and policy, I demonstrate how EU scripts have undergone a non-strategic and unintended transition in this continuum from demanding results (human rights script) to favouring cooperation with China (diplomacy script). To account for this change, I draw on interviews with diplomats, process-tracing, and document analysis to posit that the EU became ‘entrapped’ in a process-focused dialogue. This has been accompanied by a ‘foreign policy learning’ process through which the EU established a wider <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> for normative pluralism. After tactically learning to ‘speak human rights’ until 1995, I argue that China’s strategic and persistent counter-human rights diplomacy have created an environment placing the EU at the receiving end of normative influence. By showing how in engaging with China, the EU as a traditional human rights promoter modified its beliefs on appropriate HRD, I contribute to a broader literature on the impact (or the lack thereof) of Western human rights promotion in China. More broadly, in a world increasingly shaped by non-hegemonic normative relationships, this dissertation seeks to advance development of a paradigm of two-way socialisation processes to capture the dynamics of contemporary renegotiations of the role of values in diplomacy. My findings intend to stimulate rather than settle debates on whether the ‘values of diplomacy’ constitute an adequate and sufficient response to a fading Western monopoly of normative powerhood. published_or_final_versionModern Languages and CulturesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

In 2007 Storey Gallery commissioned the artist team Snæbjörnsdóttir/Wilson to develop a project investigating the various and complex relationships between human and non-human animals in shared and contested spaces. Working primarily {{in the city of}} Lancaster and the surrounding area, with a variety of individuals, businesses and organisations, the artists burrowed around the ever-shifting <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance,</b> gathering anecdotes and stories of human/animal cohabitation, encroachment and symbiotic partnerships. In addition, they toured around the UK with a mobile radio unit, visiting people’s homes, country fairs, and town centres, documenting the multiplicity of people’s feelings towards animals-in-proximity. The conversations were recorded and aired live on Radio Animal, an online radio station created by Snæbjörnsdóttir/Wilson, dedicated to their discourse around human/animal relations. For millennia, humans have been making divisions between themselves and other animals. By building settlements, towns and cities, they created shelter and insulation from wild animals. However, animals have always been attracted to concentrations of human population because of the opportunities these provide for habitat and food. For some humans, the presence of these creatures – pigeons, starlings, rats, mice, foxes, and all manner of insects - constitutes a threat, a kind of leakage. It highlights the fragility of our insulation from the ‘wild’, its unpredictability, and the seeming chaos of ‘nature’. The exhibition Uncertainty in the City: Pests, Pets, and Prey explores this animal infringement through the use of sound, sculpture, text, video, and photography. It builds a picture of human ambivalence towards animals – <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> and intolerance, <b>of</b> fear and loathing, of affection, conflict, and admiration - {{and at the same time}} it explores more broadly our own duplicity in relation to ideas of the ‘other’.

At the same time a few other aspects of the problem are envisaged, namely, the necessity of evaluating the probable intake of the additives, short of which the acceptable daily intake concept fails to acquire practical significance. © 1973 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.
