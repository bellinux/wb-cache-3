40|$|<b>Machining</b> <b>forces</b> can {{nowadays}} {{be measured}} by using 3 D dynamometers, which are usually very expensive devices and hardly available {{for most of the}} CNC machine-tools users. On the other hand, modern CNC controllers have nowadays the ability to display and save many outputs within the machining process, such as the currents or even the torques at the shaft's level for the feed motors on each axis. These outputs can be used for estimating the <b>machining</b> <b>forces,</b> but it is to be noticed that the above-mentioned currents and torques are proportional with the overall resistant forces, which includes not only technological forces, but also friction, inertial and pre-tensioning forces. This paper presents an approach for estimating the <b>machining</b> <b>forces</b> during a milling process, by using the outputs stored in the CNC controller and separating the effects of technological forces from the other forces involved in the process. The separation was made by running two sets of experiments, one set for dry-run regime and the other one for machining regime...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 62 - 66. Micro milling {{is widely}} used in precision manufacturing industry which is suitable for producing micro scale parts having three dimensional surfaces made from engineering materials. High material removal rate is its main advantage over other micro manufacturing technologies such as lithography, micro EDM, laser ablation etc. Modeling of micro milling process is essential to maximize material removal rate and to obtain desired surface quality {{at the end of}} the process. The first step in predicting the performance of micro milling process is an accurate model for <b>machining</b> <b>forces.</b> <b>Machining</b> <b>forces</b> are directly related to machine tool characteristics where the process is performed. The spindle and the micro milling tool affects the <b>machining</b> <b>forces.</b> In this thesis, the influence of runout of the spindle system on micro milling forces is investigated. Two different spindle systems with different levels of runout are considered and necessary modifications are introduced to model the trajectory of the tool center for better prediction of process outputs in the presence of runout. A modified mechanistic force modeling technique has been used to model meso/micro scale milling forces. Detailed micro milling experiments have been performed to calculate the cutting and edge force coefficients for micro end mills having diameters of 2, 0. 6, and 0. 4 mm while machining titanium alloy Ti 6 AL 4 V. Good agreements have been observed between the predicted and measured forces. It is found that statically measured runout values do not translate into dynamic machining conditions due to <b>machining</b> <b>forces</b> acting on the end mill. Kanlı, MuammerM. S...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In present study, neural {{networks}} have been employed {{for studying the}} ultrasonic vibration-assisted turning (UAT) process and for predicting the <b>machining</b> <b>force</b> and workpiece's surface roughness. Extensive experiments were carried out using different values of UAT parameters such as vibration amplitude, depth of cut, feed rate and cutting speed. The tests were implemented {{on the basis of}} full factorial design of experiments for three different levels of each UAT parameter. The <b>machining</b> <b>force</b> and workpiece's surface roughness were measured as the responses of the experiments and were subsequently modeled with the aid of back propagation multilayer perceptron neural network for 1. 1191 steel. The nonlinear relation existing between the aforementioned UAT parameters and the <b>machining</b> <b>force</b> and workpiec's surface roughness could effectively be modeled by the developed networks and the responses error could be kept less than ten percent. This was verified by further experiments different from those carried out for developing the network...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for {{the determination of}} the optimal machining parameters (spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut) in ball-end milling process of carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRP). In this case, considering the <b>machining</b> <b>force</b> and surface roughness as the constrains, maximum material removal rate is created through coupling response surface method (RSM) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Many experiments on CFRP were conducted to obtain <b>machining</b> <b>force</b> and surface Roughness values, and then analysis of variance was performed. In order to predict constrains values, RSM was selected to create mathematical relation between machining parameters and constrains. The material removal rate constituted the main function for PSO and <b>machining</b> <b>force,</b> and also surface roughness were applied to the input function of PSO. In this study, the function was optimized by PSO code, and the optimum parameters were obtained. Finally, the results of PSO were tested experimentally and compared with numerical results...|$|R

A machinability study {{has been made in}} the simulated oral clinical machining of LDGC with a dental handpiece and diamond burs, regarding the diamond tool wear and chip control, <b>machining</b> <b>forces</b> and energy, surface finish and integrity. <b>Machining</b> <b>forces,</b> speeds and energy in in vitro dental adjusting of LDGC were measured by a high-speed data acquisition and force sensor system. Machined LDGC surfaces were assessed using three-dimensional non-contact chromatic confocal optical profilometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Diamond bur morphology and LDGC chip shapes were also examined using SEM. Minimum tool wear but significant LDGC chip accumulations were found. <b>Machining</b> <b>forces</b> and energy significantly depended on machining conditions (p< 0. 05) and were significantly higher than other glass ceramics (p< 0. 05). Machining speeds dropped more rapidly with increased removal rates than other glass ceramics (p< 0. 05). Two material machinability indices associated with the hardness, Young’s modulus and fracture toughness were derived based on the normal force-removal rate relations, which ranked LDGC the most difficult to machine among glass ceramics. Surface roughness for machined LDGC was comparable for other glass ceramics. The removal mechanisms of LDGC were dominated by penetration-induced brittle fracture and shear-induced plastic deformation. Unlike most other glass ceramics, distinct intergranular and transgranular fractures of lithium disilicate crystals were found in LDGC.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringAs {{the use of}} {{composites}} increases, {{more problems}} arise with processing and manufacturing {{of this type of}} material {{in order to make it}} a more durable and reliable for today’s applications. One of the most important problems in the cutting of composites is the poor quality of the machined surface and unknown status of the <b>machining</b> <b>forces.</b> Knowing the status of forces during the final machining process helps reduce such defects as delamination and fiber-matrix debonding. This research attempted to develop a fully theoretical model for edge trimming of composites for fiber orientations greater than 90 degrees. The energy method was used as the approach, and the <b>machining</b> <b>forces</b> were compared to the experimental results. A series of experiments were conducted to validate the theoretical foundations. Composite coupons with different fiber orientations and tool rake angles were prepared for the machining experiments, and the cutting forces were measured using a four-component dynamometer. In addition, a finite element model (FEM) was built to model the depth of damage along the fibers. The theoretical depth of damage compared to the FEM analysis showed that they were in good agreement. The parameters affecting the <b>machining</b> <b>forces</b> of composites can be divided into three categories: tool geometry, material properties, and machining conditions. The effect of all of these parameters is reflected in the formula. In addition to the thrust and cutting forces, the depth of damage along the fibers can be calculated. It was concluded that the material properties and machining conditions, more than the geometry of an orthogonal cutting tool, are more influential in affecting the processing and manufacturing of composite materials...|$|E

This study presents a mechanistic cutting force simulation model for ball end milling processes, using ray casting and voxel representation methods used in 3 D computer graphics field. Using this method, instantaneous uncut chip cross sectional areas can be extracted, {{which can be}} used in cutting pressure coefficient extraction and machining simulation including <b>machining</b> <b>forces</b> and geometry of the workpiece. The major advantage of the proposed scheme is that it can simulate milling processes with arbitrary cutting tool geometry on a workpiece with complex geometry, using an algorithm with constant time complexity. A series of cutting experiments were carried out to validate the model. A dynamic simulation has also been incorporated in the model. A multi-degree of freedom nonlinear structural dynamic method is used to model the vibration. The dynamic model is validated through experiments with a chatter detection strategy. The model efficiently simulate and chatter and tool deflection resulting from vibration due to cutting forces. Industrial application of the model and impact to the business aspect, are also described. ...|$|E
