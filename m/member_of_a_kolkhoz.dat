5000|$|A sovkhoz (совхо́з, {{abbreviated}} from советское хозяйство, [...] "Soviet farm"), typically {{translated as}} state farm, is a state-owned farm. The term {{originated in the}} Soviet Union, hence the name. The term is still in use in some post-Soviet states. It is usually contrasted with <b>kolkhoz,</b> which is <b>a</b> collective-owned farm. Unlike the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>kolkhoz,</b> which were called [...] "kolkhozniks" [...] (колхозники), the workers <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sovkhoz were officially called [...] "sovkhoz workers" [...] (работники совхозов) and rarely (and then only colloquially) [...] "sovkhozniki".|$|R

5000|$|As a {{collective}} farm, <b>a</b> <b>kolkhoz</b> was legally organized as a production cooperative.

50|$|Jalal Garyaghdi {{was born}} on June 2, 1914, in Shusha. He was keen on {{painting}} and modeling in school years. After graduating from the secondary school, {{he was sent to}} Baku and entered Azerbaijan State College of Arts. Such eminent Russian realist artists as Gerasimov, Pridatok and Kosichkin taught at that school at the time. The latter had a great {{role in the development of}} Garyaghdi's interest in landscape painting. While studying at the college, he attended the studios of Yelizaveta Tripolskaya and Pinhas Sabsai. After graduating from college in Baku, he entered the Tbilisi State Academy of Arts, where he was admitted in the class <b>of</b> <b>a</b> talented sculptor and pedagogue professor Iakob Nikoladze (1976-1951), in 1934. Nikoladze's teaching system was based on thorough and attentive study of landscape. He helped Garyaghdi develop the skill of seeing nature and giving it sharp plastic forms. Results of Nikoladze's system are reflected in earlier works of Garyaghdi. Even during his education, he made <b>a</b> bass-relief <b>of</b> Alexander Pushkin timed to the poet's anniversary in 1937. After returning to Baku, Jalal Garyaghdi started working independently. The bas-relief portrait of Shota Rustaveli and sculptural figure of young Stalin were among his works created in that period. Two-metre tall sculpture <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>kolkhoz</b> farmer man, which was used in the design of the Gagajukh-chab pipe (<b>a</b> line <b>of</b> Samur-Davachi canal) along with <b>a</b> monumental statue <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>kolkhoz</b> farmer woman by Yelizaveta Tripolskaya and bas-reliefs of Pinhas Sabsai, was one of Garyaghdi's first monumental works.|$|R
50|$|Vohnja (Fonal) manor has {{a history}} going back to at least 1504, when the estate was owned by the van der Heyde family. Later, in 1629 {{during the time of}} Swedish rule in Estonia, it is {{recorded}} to have belonged to the Oxenstierna family. Later it belonged to different Baltic German families, the last of which was Tiesenhausen. The family acquired the estate in 1837 and it stayed in the family until the land reform that followed the Estonian Declaration of Independence in 1919.
