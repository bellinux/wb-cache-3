40|$|Pollution of {{soil and}} feed on the area of Celje, Jesenice, Mežica and Žirovski Vrh {{represent}} {{an important source of}} intake of contaminants into the bodies of animals and humans. The purpose of study was to assess the level of contamination of the soil and feed with potentially toxic metals and radioactive isotopes. At each site 2 - 7 samples were collected. Sample was analyzed using three different methods: XRF, AAS and VLG, by which elements and radionuclides in maize, grass and soil were determined. In soil from all locations, except Škofja Loka (control location), critical value of at least one potentially toxic metal was exceeded. Even in feed the majority of nutrients exceeds recommended values, or even the <b>maximum</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>levels,</b> which makes it potentially dangerous for cattle. Concentrations of molybdenum and cadmium in feed are so high that the cattle can potentially suffer from molybdenosis or overall decline in capability. Humans are exposed to contaminants via the consumption of beef and milk. Since the calculated values of cadmium in cattle liver and kidney highly exceed the <b>maximum</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>levels,</b> these organs are not suitable for consumption. The specific activity of radionuclides in feed in contaminated areas is significantly higher than in Škofja Loka, therefore greater radiation dose can be expected than the one received by cattle due to the natural radiation in environment. Elevated levels of radionuclides in the feed are also the reason that the calculated specific activity of radionuclides in cow's milk and beef on all collected areas exceed world reference values...|$|R

When these compounds were used in combination, the doses of tartaric acid necessary to reach a suitable pH were reduced.

In {{a first step in}} the risk evaluation process as proposed by the European Union, the individual food consumption data were multiplied with the <b>maximum</b> <b>permitted</b> use <b>levels</b> for benzoates per food group. The median (interquartile range) estimated daily intake is, respectively, 2. 0 (1. 0 - 3. 2) mg/kg bw, 1. 7 (1. 1 - 2. 7) mg/kg bw and 1. 92 (1. 3 - 3. 0) mg/kg bw for preschool children, adolescents and adult women. In all age groups, the greatest potential contributor to the total estimated benzoate intake was the group of non-alcoholic flavoured drinks. At respectively the 92 nd percentile (children), the 97 th percentile (adolescents) and the 94 th percentile (women), the accepted daily intake (ADI) of 5 mg/kg bw/day is exceeded slightly.

Ochratoxin A has teratogenic, carcinogenic, hepatotoxic and especially nephrotoxic effects on human and animals. According to the dietary recommendations in Iran, consumption of soft drinks is decreasing, while the consumption of nutritive beverages such as non alcoholic beer, is increasing. Therefore, this study was carried out to evaluate the content of Ochratoxin A in 70 malt beverage samples (35 local and 35 imported) which were collected randomly from supermarkets of Tabriz in Iran during July to September 2006. These samples were analyzed for levels of Ochratoxin A by ELISA technique. Results were compared with the European proposed maximum limit (2 ppb), for Ochratoxin A in beer. In general, all of the local and imported samples were contaminated with Ochratoxin A but the levels of contamination were under the <b>maximum</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>levels.</b> The mean Ochratoxin A concentrations in local and imported samples were 96. 04 Â± 126. 13 and 60. 71 Â± 47. 82 ng L- 1 , respectively that the difference was not statistically significant (p> 0. 05).

The classification of European soil types into soil groups with significantly different soil-to-plant transfer of radiocaesium, and the allocation of a transfer value to each soil group provide the greatest uncertainties within this approach.
