40|$|The VKM Panel {{for plant}} {{protection}} products considered Frupica SC in a meeting on 25. 11. 2010, and found the active ingredient problematic with regard to carcinogenic effects and possible genotoxicity. M 11 is a metabolite of <b>mepanipyrim</b> which is the active ingredient the plant protection product Frupica SC. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority has asked the applicant for further assessment of the genotoxic potential of the metabolite M 11. The applicant has submitted a rat liver in vivo Comet assay of the metabolite, and the panel has been requested to consider if the genotoxic properties of <b>mepanipyrim</b> and the metabolite M 11 is adequately documented. The metabolite M 11 caused positive findings in in vitro studies for bacterial mutation and chromosomal aberrations. Three in vivo studies (Micronucleus, unscheduled DNA synthesis and Comet assay) did not show evidence of genotoxicity. Based on the documentation available, VKMs Panel on Plant Protection Products concludes that <b>mepanipyrim</b> and the metabolite M 11 {{should not be considered}} genotoxic in vivo. The lack of demonstrated in vivo genotoxicity makes it likely that <b>mepanipyrim</b> induces liver tumors in rats and mice by a mechanism that involves a threshold below which tumors are not expected to develop. This conclusion is strengthened by the finding of a promoter-like behavior of <b>mepanipyrim</b> for induction of gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase positive foci in rat liver...|$|E
40|$|The fate of five {{fungicide}} residues (azoxystrobin, fluazinam, kresoxim-methyl, <b>mepanipyrim,</b> and tetraconazole) from vine to {{wine was}} studied, {{to evaluate the}} decay ratio and study {{the influence of the}} technological process. The disappearance rates on grapes were described as pseudo-first-order kinetics (r between 0. 96 and 0. 99) and half-life (t(1 / 2)) in the range of 4. 3 - 15. 2 days. After winemaking, fluazinam, <b>mepanipyrim,</b> and tetraconazole had negligible residues in all samples. This was due to fermentation in the case of fluazinam and <b>mepanipyrim</b> and to removal during the formation of must in the case of tetraconazole. The residue level of azoxystrobin was higher in the wine obtained by vinification without maceration than with maceration. Azoxystrobin was the only active ingredient found in both grapes and wine.

The persistence of this active substance has been demonstrated in soil, surface and ground waters, and in water destined to human uses. Degradation processes were carried out in aqueous solutions by means of UV light, Ozone (O 3), UV/O 3, and heterogeneous photocatalysis using TiO 2 and Pilkington Active Blue glass. The experiments were performed through a solar simulator (Suntest CPS) furnished with a xenon lamp. The identification and quantification of <b>mepanipyrim</b> residues and its degradation products were achieved by using liquid chromatography/DAD coupled with mass spectrometry (LC/DAD-MS). The efficiencies of the different oxidation methods were compared. Independently of the oxidation process assessed, the decomposition of <b>mepanipyrim</b> always followed pseudo first order kinetics, and new oxidation by-products were identified compared to literature. A large difference in the production of derivatives was observed between degradation mechanism of ozonation and heterogeneous photocatalysis using Pilkington Active Blue glas.

40|$|Advanced {{oxidation}} processes (AOPs) {{have been}} proved as an innovative and promising alternative route {{for the treatment}} of wastewater containing recalcitrant organic compounds such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, surfactants, colouring matters and endocrine disrupting chemicals. Some of these compounds pose severe problems in biological treatment systems due to their resistance to biodegradation, and often exert toxic effects on microbial processes [1]. Among AOPs technologies, heterogeneous photocatalysis with semiconductors was the most popular and effective widely employed method for water purification and wastewater treatment [2]. This study examines the photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) towards removal of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from water. Model compounds including a widely used analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen, along with <b>mepanipyrim,</b> which is a common fungicide frequently used in the agricultural activities have been selected as case study. Two experiments were carried out using TiO 2 as (i) dispersed powder; (ii) TiO 2 immobilized on the surface of a commercial coated glass. The scanning electron analysis for the TiO 2 coated active glass was also accomplished (Fig. 1). A cooled solar simulator furnished with a xenon lamp 1, 500 W total power, 500 W/m 2 irradiance, in the wavelength range 290 - 800 nm was used for sample irradiation at 25 °C constant temperature. Kinetics of each photoreaction was determined, and the identification of the photoproducts was performed using liquid chromatography coupled with Fourier-Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (LC-FTICR MS). The overall results suggest that active thin layer of TiO 2 immobilized on glass surface can avoid the recovery problems related to the use of TiO 2 powder in heterogeneous photo-catalysis and may be a promising tool towards protecting the environment from emerging contaminants such as ibuprofen and <b>mepanipyrim</b> [3]...|$|E

A well-known commercial product Pilkington Active™ Blue glass has been tested as immobilized TiO 2 system. Experiments were performed in batch mode at laboratory scale and results were compared in terms of disappearance kinetics. Transformation products (TPs) were identified by Surveyor LC system coupled to a hybrid LTQ-FTICR (7 -Tesla) mass spectrometer (MS). Simple mechanisms of degradation for different AOPs were proposed. New by-products formed during the degradation processes were identified. Since primarily hydroxy derivatives were identified in aqueous suspensions, the mechanism of degradation was probably based on hydroxyl radical attack. The greatest difference {{in the quality of}} transformation products was observed between the heterogeneous photocatalysis using suspended TiO 2 and Pilkington Active™ Blue glass system.

40|$|Pesticides {{are among}} the most widely used {{chemicals}} in the world. Because of the widespread use of agricultural chemicals in food production, people are exposed to low levels of pesticide residues through their diets. Scientists do not yet have a total understanding of the health effects of these pesticide residues. This work aims to determine differences in terms of pesticide residue content in Portuguese strawberries grown using different agriculture practices. The Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe sample preparation method was conducted and shown to have good performance for multiclass pesticides extraction in strawberries. The screening of 25 pesticides residue was performed by gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. In quantitative validation, acceptable performances were achieved with recoveries of 70 – 120 and < 12 % residual standard deviation for 25 pesticides. Good linearity was obtained for all the target compounds, with highly satisfactory repeatability. The limits of detection were in the range of 0. 1 – 28 μg/kg. The method was applied to analyze strawberry samples from organic and integrated pest management (IPM) practices harvested in 2009 – 2010.

Within this group of contaminants, Emerging Contaminants are mostly unregulated compounds that may be candidates for future regulation. In this work the application of different solar driven oxidation processes: photolysis, solar titanium dioxide photocatalysis (TiO 2), solar photo-Fenton using peroxymonosulfate as oxidant (PMS/Fe(II)) are studied as tertiary treatments for the remediation of micropollutants spiked in real municipal {{wastewater treatment plants}} effluents at pilot plant scale. The examined pollutants were a multicomponent solution at low concentration level (10 µg L− 1 at maximum 1 mg L- 1) of herbicides and pharmaceutical compounds: sulcotrione, <b>mepanipyrim,</b> 2 -methyl- 4 -chlorophenoxyacetic acid, ibuprofen and diclofenac. A solar panel pilot plant was used for the photocatalytic experiments. The process was mainly evaluated by a fast and reliable analytical method based on a HPLC system. Solar titanium dioxide (0. 7 gr L- 1) and photo-Fenton process using low iron and peroxymonosulfate doses ([Fe(II) ] = 100 µM; [PMS] = 200 µM) were proved to be an efficient methods for the elimination of these compounds with relatively high degradation rates. Independently of the oxidation method assessed, the photocatalytic degradation of multicomponent mixture of emerging contaminants with solar advanced processes followed apparent first-order kinetics.

In this respect, it is advisable to strengthen existing technologies for the decontamination of water, {{with the aim of}} enhance the degradation methods for recalcitrant organic compounds. [1] In our previous study, we have demonstrated that the application of advanced oxidation processes promises to be a profitable expedient for the rapid degradation and detoxification of persistent herbicides as imazethapyr. [2] The capabilities of the oxidation processes to degrade organic pollutants in water and the variety of derivatives formed is illustrated here by the case of <b>Mepanipyrim</b> [N-(4 -methyl- 6 -prop- 1 -ynylpyrimidin- 2 -yl) aniline], a widely used pyrimidinic fungicide.

Comparisons between different oxidation techniques can provide useful information on the mechanisms of these processes, and are of particular concern in the assessment of the most efficient experimental conditions for the destruction of organic pollutants. The advanced oxidation methods compared were ozonation (without application of any initiator), UV-photolysis and UV-O 3 coupled treatment. Kinetics of reactions were determined.

En primer lugar se ha validado la metodología analítica para la determinación de los fungicidas en uva y vino, mediante extracción multirresiduos QuEChERS con acetonitrilo y análisis por HPLC-MS/MS (triple cuadrupolo). Alcanzando un límite de cuantificación de 0, 01 ppm, una linealidad de respuesta (R 2 > 0, 998) y exactitud (70 - 110 %) y precisión con SD 0, 998) and an {{accuracy}} (70 - 110 %) and precision with SD< 20 %. In the wines made from grapes {{treated in the}} field under GAP, the LMR established for grapes were not surpassed. In the Tempranillo varieties under CPA treatments, kresoxim-metyl and metrafenone slightly exceeded the el LMR (1. 48 and 0. 84 versus 1 and 0. 5 ppm, respectively). In the wines fortified in the winery with fenhexamid, <b>mepanipyrim</b> and cyazofamid, the LMR were not exceeded. The presence of fungicide residues in the Tempranillo wines had no significant effect on their antioxidant activity. In the Graciano wines, boscalid+kresoxim-methyl and metrafenone presented significant differences in their antioxidant capacity. Residues of boscalid+kresoxim-methyl, fenhexamid and cyazofamid reduce the total polyphenols (Folin-Ciocalteu index) in Tempranillo. In contrast, metrafenone slightly increases it in Graciano. The most notable phenolic fraction in Tempranillo and Graciano is the antocianos (70. 45 and 77. 50 % respectively), followed by the hidroxicinnamic derivatives (18. 31 and 13. 64 %) and flavonols (14. 62 and 9. 95 %). The stilbenes in Graciano wines show slightly higher percentages than in Tempranillo (6. 34 versus 4. 98 %). The in vitro bioavailability of the fungicides in Graciano wine shows a positive matrix effect with respect to Tempranillo. Dialysis percentages range from 6. 1 % for kresoxim-metil in Tempranillo to 36. 6 % for boscalid in Graciano. <b>Mepanipyrim</b> in Tempranillo and boscalid in Graciano present the greatest bioavailability. It is confirmed that the clarification has a slight positive effect on bioavailability. In wines made from grapes treated under CPA, the dialyzation percentages of boscalid and kresoxim-methyl stood between 21 and 31 %, while metrafenone did not present dialyzation. No dialyzation occurred for cyazofamid added to the must. It {{has been shown that}} fungicide residues affect the bioavailability of both the phenolic fraction and the antioxidant activity, but no clear differences were found in the dialyzation of the phenolic fraction for either wine. The stilbenes were the phenolic compounds that showed the highest percentage of dialyzation (50 %). The total polyphenol content after the in vitro digestion of wine fell on average by 10 % with respect to the initial content in Tempranillo treated in the field and by more than 18 % in the case of cyazofamid added prior to vinification. The results were similar for Graciano, except in the treatments with the boscalid and kresoxim-methyl mix, where the bioavailability of the polyphenols increased by up to 25 %. The presence of the fungicides studied affects the bioavailability of the antioxidant activity of the Tempranillo wines, but not that of the Graciano ones. Finally, it has been shown that, in general, for all the pesticides studied the in vitro bioavailability does not exceed 37 % dialyzation with respect to the initial concentration present in the wine, which indicates a clear safety margin in toxicological terms...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pesticides {{are used}} to control pests and {{diseases}} in modern agriculture but unfortunately their residues {{can be found on}} agricultural crops, and in the human’s dietary. Although the best way to decrease the risk associated with the presence of pesticides on agro-food is following organic farming techniques, most farmers may not avoid the use of chemicals in pest management strategies. A good approach to the problem should therefore guarantee good agricultural yields and low pesticide residues allowing the use of environmental safety pesticides on crops, so joining consumer’s safeness with farmer’s necessity. Results: The behaviour of various pesticides used in IPM strategies on grapes and tomatoes were studied. All the analytical methods showed good recoveries, and good separation of the molecules. Repeatability and intermediate precision showed good results, and LODs and LOQs were far below the MRLs set by EU for these pesticides in tomatoes and grapes. The analysis of pesticide residues on tomatoes showed that cv. with little berries accounted for higher residue levels than cv. with big berries. They also showed an high persistence of azoxystrobin, cyproconazole, cyprodinil, penconazole, tolclofos-methyl, <b>mepanipyrim,</b> pyrimethanil, famoxadone fenamidone, fenhexamid, iprodione, and a rapid degradation of triadimenol, cymoxanil, iprovalicarb, fenarimol, and fludioxonil. On grapes, the behaviour in field and the transfer to wine during winemaking of iprovalicarb, indoxacarb, and boscalid, was studied. The residue levels found in grapes were far below the MRLs set for grapes in EU, accounting at harvest time 0. 81, 0. 43, and 4. 23 mg/kg for iprovalicarb, indoxacarb, and boscalid, respectively. The residue levels in the samples treated with boscalid may have residual problems (due to an accumulation effect) if repeated field treatments will be performed. Winemaking experiments showed a complete transfer of all pesticide from grapes to the must, while in wine the residues were low or negligible due to the adsorbing effect of lees and pomace. The clarification experiments showed a good removal of pesticide residues from the wine media, for all pesticides. The data obtained in two years survey of pesticide residues on wines following IPM strategies, showed residues less than maximum residue limits (MRLs). The most pesticides present a residue absent, some (benalaxyl, metalaxyl, iprovalicarb, penconazole, cymoxanil and thiophanate-metyl) showed a residual below the minimum limit of detection (LOD). No residues were found above the LOQ (0, 01 mg/kg). Conclusions: The obtained data showed the possibility to get tomatoes and wine at "zero residue" or, at least, with residues below the limit of quantification (LOQ). The data collected on tomato have also shown the difference in initial deposition of pesticide joined {{to the size of the}} berries in order to obtain products with lower pesticide residues, paying more attention to chemical treatments for the defense of cultivars with small berries. ...|$|E
