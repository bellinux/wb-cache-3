40|$|Introduction The {{extent to}} which we can {{represent}} musical information in computers, {{in a way that}} matches our mental images, {{is one of the most}} intriguing and compelling questions in music research. Leman (1993) distinguishes three kinds of musical representation: 1. Acoustical, i. e. based on the physical properties of sound (e. g., sonograms, spectrograms). 2. Subsymbolic, i. e. based on the known behaviour of the human hearing system and how the human brain processes auditory information (e. g., auditory models). 3. Symbolic, i. e. based on the manipulation of symbols (e. g., Common <b>Music</b> <b>Notation).</b> Our <b>research</b> focuses on the mapping between a symbolic (or abstract) system (in this case a colour model) and the perceptual dimensions of musical sounds. The postulate here is that it is possible to devise a visual approach to sound design based on human cognitive associations between auditory and visual percepts. Empirically derived auditory-visual associations can contribute to th...|$|R
40|$|New {{things are}} {{often viewed as}} being better and more {{advanced}} than older counterparts; however, new does not denote superior. <b>Music</b> <b>notation</b> serves as one example of an innovation that is both lauded and derided. Early forms of <b>music</b> <b>notation</b> appear vague and ambiguous according to modern standards. But when combined with oral traditions, early <b>music</b> <b>notation</b> contained all the information required for a successful performance. Most facts pertaining to the notation of each period are clear, but multiple interpretations of early notation exist. The objective {{of this research is}} to critically analyze key periods of Western <b>music</b> <b>notation</b> to formulate a model for the evaluation of early <b>notation.</b> The <b>research</b> methodology consists of engaging primary and secondary sources from historical documents. These sources include scores, early musical treatises, and contemporary interpretations. The concluded model asserts that early <b>music</b> <b>notation</b> seems insufficient, imprecise, and indefinite when compared to contemporary forms, but early notation cannot be removed from the context it served and evaluated through the scope of modern requirements. From the origin of neumes in the ninth century to the rhythmic developments of the Ars Nova period in the fourteenth century, the evolution of <b>music</b> <b>notation</b> progressed as series of innovations that worked alongside oral traditions to meet the musical demands of each period...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} design and {{implementation}} of an object-oriented toolkit for <b>music</b> <b>notation.</b> It considers whether object-oriented technology provides features that are desirable for representing <b>music</b> <b>notation.</b> The ability to sympathetically represent the conventions of <b>music</b> <b>notation</b> provides software tools that are flexible to use, and easily extended to represent less common features of <b>music</b> <b>notation.</b> The design and implementation of an object-oriented class hierarchy that captures the structural and semantic relationships of <b>music</b> <b>notation</b> symbols is described. Functions that search for symbols, and update symbol positions are also implemented. Traditional context-sensitive and spatial relationships between music symbols may be maintained, or extended to provide notational features found in modern music. MIDI functionality includes the ability to play <b>music</b> <b>notation</b> and to allow step-recording of MIDI events. The toolkit {{has been designed to}} simplify the creation of applications that make use of music notation; example applications are created to demonstrate its capabilities.

5000|$|Over {{the past}} three centuries, {{hundreds}} of <b>music</b> <b>notation</b> systems have been proposed as alternatives to traditional western <b>music</b> <b>notation.</b> Many of these systems seek to improve upon traditional notation by using a [...] "chromatic staff" [...] in which each of the 12 pitch classes has its own unique place on the staff. Examples are the Ailler-Brennink notation, Jacques-Daniel Rochat's Dodeka system, Tom Reed's Twinline notation, Russell Ambrose's Ambrose Piano Tabs, Paul Morris' Clairnote, John Keller's Express Stave, and Jos√© A. Sotorrio's Bilinear <b>Music</b> <b>Notation.</b> These notation systems do not {{require the use of}} standard key signatures, accidentals, or clef signs. They also represent interval relationships more consistently and accurately than traditional <b>notation.</b> The <b>Music</b> <b>Notation</b> Project (formerly known as the <b>Music</b> <b>Notation</b> Modernization Association) has a website with information on many of these notation systems.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} trace the {{development}} of a <b>notation</b> <b>research</b> experiment aimed at developing a scoring system for silence. Silence has kinetic roles in social exchanges: quietude, reflective pauses, withdrawal, displays of consent or dissent, reception and interpretation. But how can we score something not present, yet also not absent? Is there a positive notation for this critical issue of performance, of silence in the voice, other than merely the courtesies of extended rests, or blanks in the score? The reader will see inscriptions that oscillate between pictures and writing, and between visual and auditory, exemplifying those capacities of drawing to operate in the spaces between languages.

40|$|Around 2000, {{many people}} {{realized}} that XML technology {{could be a}} great way to finally create a successful interchange format for <b>music</b> <b>notation</b> and digital sheet music applications. In the past, adoption of <b>music</b> <b>notation</b> interchange formats had suffered from both technical and social problems. Previous efforts like SMDL and NIFF never met their goals of becoming a standard <b>music</b> <b>notation</b> interchange format, even with the ISO 10743 seal of approval for SMDL. The major technical problem was to design a format that was complete enough for both commercial and academic use, while usable enough to be approachable for developers. The major social problem was how to get the format adopted by the market leaders in <b>music</b> <b>notation</b> editing, both of whom were inclined to keep to their proprietary formats. MusicXML overcame these technical and social problems to become the first successful interchange standard designed for <b>music</b> <b>notation</b> applications.

30|$|Indian {{classical}} music, {{including its}} two varieties, Carnatic and Hindustani music, has a rich music tradition and enjoys {{a wide audience}} from {{various parts of the}} world. The Carnatic music which is more popular in South India still continues to be uninfluenced by other music traditions {{and is one of the}} purest forms of Indian music. Like other music traditions, Carnatic music also has developed its musicography, out of which, a notation system called Sargam is most commonly practiced. This paper deals with development of a music representation or encoding system for the Sargam notation scheme which enables easy <b>music</b> <b>notation</b> storage, publishing, and retrieval using computers. This work follows a novel idea of developing a Unicode-based encoding logic and allows storage and easy retrieval of <b>music</b> <b>notation</b> files in a computer.
