We climbed up to about 200 metres, when suddenly two Thunderbolts appeared behind us and instantly shot down Günther Kirchner's plane. I saw him jettison canopy and catapult but his parachute did not deploy. I was very lucky that the Thunderbolts did not press on with another attack.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the third}} day of the trial, Hunt asked Anthony whether she had {{anything}} to say. She responded with [...] "the most famous speech {{in the history of the}} agitation for woman suffrage", according to Ann D. Gordon, a historian of the women's movement. Repeatedly ignoring the judge's order to stop talking and sit down, she protested what she called [...] "this high-handed outrage upon <b>my</b> citizen's <b>rights</b> ... you have trampled under foot every vital principle of our government. <b>My</b> natural <b>rights,</b> <b>my</b> civil <b>rights,</b> <b>my</b> political <b>rights,</b> <b>my</b> judicial <b>rights,</b> are all alike ignored." ...|$|R

25|$|Walter Lowrie reminds {{the reader}} that Kierkegaard has said, 'With <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand I held out the Edifying Discourses, with my left the {{aesthetic}} works-and all grasped with the right hand what I held in my left.’ This would pair right and left as Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions and Stages on Life’s Way, then Three Discourses in Various Spirits with A Literary Review; and The Lilies of the Field and the Birds of the Air with Either/Or, 2nd edition. He indicates a plan to Kierkegaard's writing.|$|E
25|$|A {{line from}} Shakespeare has {{sometimes}} been taken to mean that he was deaf in one ear: Come on <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand, for this ear is deaf. No classical source mentions hearing impairment in connection with Caesar. The playwright may have been making metaphorical use of a passage in Plutarch that does not refer to deafness at all, but rather to a gesture Alexander of Macedon customarily made. By covering his ear, Alexander indicated that he had turned his attention from an accusation in order to hear the defence.|$|E
25|$|In the {{standard}} variant used outside of Scotland, the shield is quartered, depicting {{in the first}} and fourth quarters the three passant guardant lions of England; in the second, the rampant lion and double tressure flory-counterflory of Scotland; and in the third, a harp for Ireland. The crest is a statant guardant lion wearing the St Edward's Crown, himself on another representation of that crown. The dexter supporter is a likewise crowned English lion; the sinister, a Scottish unicorn. According to legend a free unicorn was considered a very dangerous beast; therefore the heraldic unicorn is chained, as were both supporting unicorns in the royal coat of arms of Scotland. In the greenery below, a thistle, Tudor rose and shamrock are depicted, representing Scotland, England and Ireland respectively. This armorial achievement comprises the motto of English monarchs, Dieu et mon Droit (God and <b>my</b> <b>Right),</b> which has descended to the present royal family as well as the Garter circlet which surrounds the shield, inscribed with the Order's motto, Honi soit qui mal y pense (Shame on he who thinks evil).|$|E

500|$|The verse {{may be one}} of few English nursery rhymes to have ancient origins. The Babylonian prayer [...] "Shamash before me, {{behind me}} Sin, Nergal at <b>my</b> <b>right,</b> Ninib at my left", is echoed by the medieval Jewish prayer: [...] "In the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, may Michael be at <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand; Gabriel at my left; Uriel before me; Raphael behind me and the Shekhinah of God be above my head" [...] which is used as a prayer before sleep. A Christian version has been found for Germany {{at the end of the}} Medieval period. However, the first known record of the lyrics in English is from Thomas Ady's {{witchcraft}} treatise A Candle in the Dark, or, a treatise concerning the nature of witches and witchcraft (1656), which tells of a woman in Essex who claimed to have lived in the reign of Mary I (r. 1553-8) and who was alive in his time and blessed herself every night with the [...] "popish charm": ...|$|E

500|$|After {{retirement}} from first-class cricket {{at the end}} of the 1960 season in England, McCool returned to Australia, taking up market gardening with a specialty in rare blooms at Umina Beach on the Central Coast of New South Wales. He continued playing club cricket in the Newcastle competition for Belmont until rheumatism forced him to retire from all forms of cricket aged 55: [...] "Rheumatism in <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand made it embarrassing for me to continue.

500|$|During the Seven Days Battles that {{followed}} in late June, Longstreet had operational command of {{nearly half of}} Lee's army15 brigadesas it drove McClellan back down the Peninsula. Longstreet performed aggressively and well in his new, larger command, particularly at Gaines' Mill and Glendale. Lee's army in general suffered from weak performances by Longstreet's peers, including, uncharacteristically, Stonewall Jackson, {{and was unable to}} destroy the Union Army. Moxley Sorrel wrote of Longstreet's confidence and calmness in battle: [...] "He was like a rock in steadiness when sometimes in battle the world seemed flying to pieces." [...] Gen. Lee said, [...] "Longstreet was the staff in <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand." [...] He had been established as Lee's principal lieutenant.|$|E
500|$|From {{the start}} of the war until early 1862, when {{responsibility}} was passed to the War Department, Seward was in charge of determining who should be detained without charges or trial. Approximately 800 men and a few women, believed to be Southern sympathizers or spies, were detained, usually at the initiation of local officials. [...] Once Seward was informed, he would often order that the prisoner be transferred to federal authorities. Seward was reported to have boasted to Lord Lyons that [...] "I can touch a bell on <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand, and order the arrest of a citizen... and no power on earth, except that of the President, can release them.

She called [...] "this high-handed outrage upon my citizen's rights", saying, [...] "... you have trampled under foot every vital principle of our government. <b>My</b> natural <b>rights,</b> <b>my</b> civil <b>rights,</b> <b>my</b> political <b>rights,</b> <b>my</b> judicial <b>rights,</b> are all alike ignored."

500|$|This episode reintroduces and {{resolves}} Veronica's rape, introduced {{earlier in}} the season. However, it had been largely ignored until {{this point in the}} series. The episode was the third and final episode of the series directed by Marcos Siega, after [...] "Drinking the Kool-Aid" [...] and [...] "Mars vs. Mars". In addition, the episode marks regular writer Diane Ruggiero's sixth writing credit for the show. After the episode aired, Rob Thomas called the episode [...] "our high-water mark". Commenting on Ruggiero writing the episode, he stated, [...] "She was really <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand writing the series, and it felt good to have someone who knew the voices as well as I did.

I play the melody with <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand and then harmonize it with my left.

When Villa was four, his chances of becoming a footballer were put in jeopardy when he suffered a fracture to the femur in his right leg, but he made a complete recovery. Due to the injury, {{he and his father}} worked on strengthening his left leg and Villa ultimately became ambidextrous. He recalls his father being consistently supportive: [...] "He would be there throwing me the ball over and over, making me kick it with my left leg when <b>my</b> <b>right</b> was in plaster after breaking it, I was four.
