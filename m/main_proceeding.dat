40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} content and feasibility {{of a set}} of harmonized choice of law rules (HICOL Rules) that would apply in insolvency proceedings. It contemplates a main insolvency proceeding opened in a debtor’s center of main interests (“COMI”) and the existence of (or possibility of opening) one or more non-main (or secondary) proceedings. It also contemplates the possibility that an insolvency representative in a main or non-main proceeding may seek and be granted recognition in another state under the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (codified as Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U. S.) Under HICOL Rules, as to any given issue of insolvency law and as it may relate to any particular asset, the same rule of insolvency law would apply regardless of whether the matter is addressed by the court in a debtor’s <b>main</b> <b>proceeding,</b> in a non-main proceeding, or in another forum. HICOL Rules could accommodate the application in a <b>main</b> <b>proceeding</b> of the insolvency law of a jurisdiction other than the COMI (virtual territorialism) and the application in a non-main proceeding of the insolvency law of the COMI (virtual universalism). The HICOL Rules proposed here would embrace the baseline rule that the insolvency law of the COMI applies to a debtor and its assets, wherever located. However, the HICOL Rules would respect appropriate local interests by applying the insolvency law of another jurisdiction to certain assets located in that jurisdiction. In general, under these HICOL Rules the non-COMI insolvency law would apply only to assets related to an establishment of the debtor located outside the COMI. However, even as to those establishment-related assets, the reorganization or rehabilitation provisions of the COMI insolvency law would apply. Finally, in addition to its focus on establishment-related assets as a general proxy for the identification of local interests, the paper offers some tentative suggestions relating to other issues that comprehensive HICOL Rules should address. These include the additional (and sensitive) issues concerning in rem rights, such as security interests and real property (immovables), setoff, reciprocal (i. e., executory) contracts, and employment contacts...|$|E
40|$|The European Parliament, after {{a lengthy}} debate, has {{eventually}} approved a reform of Regulation 1346 / 2000 on cross-border insolvency proceedings (hereinafter, the ‘Insolvency Regulation Recast’), which provides for significant innovations of the original Regulation, such as a EU-wide register of insolvencies and a new proceeding for insolvencies of corporate groups. The fundamental logic of the Regulation, however, does not change: the Recast does not harmonise insolvency rules at EU level and its goal is still selecting competent venues and applicable insolvency regimes. In many respects, the reform simply codifies CJEU’s case law, {{with the aim of}} increasing legal certainty. The Insolvency Regulation Recast is however innovative regarding the definition of COMI, by repealing the causality relation between criterions of ‘permanence’ and ‘ascertainability’. Eventually, the Recast aims at better coor- dinating secondary proceedings and main proceedings; in this regard, it introduces ‘synthetic secondary proceedings’, whereby the insolvency practitioner of a <b>main</b> <b>proceeding</b> undertakes to respect other Member States distributional criterions {{in order to avoid the}} opening of a secondary proceeding. The real impact of these innovations is however uncertain. ...|$|E

40|$|The European Union Insolvency Regulation (the EU Regulation) is a {{giant step}} forward in {{promoting}} international cooperation among EU countries for cross-border insolvency proceedings. It adopts a modified universalist solution to cross-border proceedings insofar as they are located within the EU. However, experience has shown that it needs improvement to work effectively. A venue battle now rages between courts of several European countries over which country 2 ̆ 7 s courts will administer particular cross-border proceedings and how the center of main interest is to be determined for this purpose. This Article begins with a detailed examination of the two principal cases where conflicts have arisen, Eurofood and Daisytek. Eurofood is a subsidiary of Parmalat, which has produced the largest invsolvency case in European history. The Irish and Italian courts have both opened main insolvency proceedings for the Eurofood subsidiary, and the controversy is now pending before the European Court of Justice (ECJ). For the Daisytek French subsidiary, both English and French courts have opened main insolvency cases, and an appeal is pending before the French Cour de Cassation, where the Ministry of Justice is expected to recommend submission to the ECJ. Two very important substantive modifications would vastly improve the EU Regulation. First. the EU Regulation needs {{to provide for the}} filing in the same country (thereby permitting the filing in the same court) of members of a corporate group that are economically integrated. It is very difficult (if at all possible) to recognize a corporate empire when its insolvency proceedings are distributed among a number of countries. Second, the EU Regulation needs to clarify the definition of 2 ̆ 2 center of main interest 2 ̆ 2 (CoMI) and to specify what a court should consider in making the CoMI decision. A court should weigh the following factors: (1) the location of operations and management decisions for the corporation; (2) the location of the 2 ̆ 2 nerve center 2 ̆ 2 or place of principal decision-making for the corporation; and (3) the expectations of creditors, such as suppliers and financiers, as to the CoMI decision in the event that the company foes into an insolvency proceeding. This Article also argues for three kinds of procedural improvements: (1) decoupling the decision on whether a proceeding is a <b>main</b> <b>proceeding</b> from the decision opening the proceeding itself, to give an opportunity to the parties in interest to be heard on the subject of whether a proceeding is a main proceeding; (2) defining what constitutes a 2 ̆ 2 judgment opening insolvency proceedings, 2 ̆ 2 to specify what steps qualify under this term in those countries where an opening order or judgment is not a typical part of the insolvency process; (3) adopting procedures to recognize the due process rights of foreign estate administrators, foreign creditors, and other parties in interest in a cross-border insolvency proceeding...|$|E
