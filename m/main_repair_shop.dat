This will be the <b>main</b> <b>repair</b> <b>shop</b> for the electric multiple unit cars, with 13 car spots on three tracks, overhead cranes and floor lifts to allow easy removal of major car components, and a DC Power system. The new facility will also include support shops to store, repair and maintain the major components, with a parts storage area. There will be a second floor which will contain offices and amenities/facilities for Metro-North employees.

50|$|In mid-April 1945, {{after the}} end of the {{fighting}} in Vienna, a large part of the factory was dismantled and transported to the Soviet Union. In addition to machinery, raw materials were also spirited away, reportedly 800 wagon loads. In spite of that, at the end of October the first locomotive built after the war, a D 42, stood in front of the factory shed. In addition to the construction of new locomotives, the general inspection of ÖStB locomotives was the main task of the factory due to the destruction of the neighbouring <b>main</b> <b>repair</b> <b>shop</b> at Floridsdorf.|$|E
50|$|The first railway repair {{workshop}} {{was opened}} in Oppum as the Königliche Eisenbahn-Haupt-Reparaturwerkstatt Oppum, ("Royal Railway <b>Main</b> <b>Repair</b> <b>Shop,</b> Oppum"). Today, the Intercity-Express maintenance facility in Krefeld is a state-of-the-art facility {{for the maintenance}} of Deutsche Bahn rolling stock. A few thousand employees are employed there. ICE and electric multiple units used for regional transport are overhauled (all components of the vehicles are inspected, renewed or repaired) there. This includes servicing major items such as air conditioners, bogies and wheelsets, but also smaller parts such as shock absorbers. Several million Euros were invested in the modernisation of the plant in economic and environmental terms.|$|E

50|$|The {{management}} of Group C - locomotive repair - also fell to a Reichsbahn inspector. He had {{the role of}} a mechanical foreman and was usually a deputy to the shedmaster. Several master tradesmen reported to him, {{depending on the size of}} the Betriebswerk. This group comprised several gangs of tradesmen (up to 30 employees) who in turn were led by various subordinate foremen. The Deutsche Reichsbahn also called this group the Abteilung Triebfahrzeug-Unterhaltung (locomotive maintenance department). Group C was responsible for carrying out repair and maintenance jobs, transferring damaged rolling stock to the <b>main</b> <b>repair</b> <b>shops,</b> ordering spare parts and materials including {{management of}} the spare parts store, monitoring new vehicle systems, keeping the breakdown train ready and recovering broken down vehicles.|$|R

50|$|The {{marshalling}} yard takes up {{an area of}} 280 hectares, has a length of 7,000 metres and a maximum width of 700 metres. When it opened it had a total track length of 300 kilometres and there were six signal boxes, 825 sets of points, 100 home, 115 distant and 688 shunting signals. As a two-sided shunting facility, Maschen has two train formation yards. The north-south system has a set of 48 departure sidings {{and a set of}} 16 reception sidings; the south-north system consists of a set of 64 departure sidings and a set of 17 reception sidings. Both systems are supplemented by storage and marshalling sidings. In addition, there is an eight-road <b>main</b> <b>repair</b> <b>shop</b> for the repair of goods wagons and an engine shed for the maintenance of electric and diesel-driven goods train locomotives with a two-road inspection hall and numerous open-air storage sidings.Two signal boxes are responsible for the yard, one for each system. Separate signal boxes that had been built for the marshalling sidings were closed again in 1983.|$|E
5000|$|Group D had {{a special}} role within the Betriebswerk and not every depot had such a department. Smaller Betriebswerke {{allocated}} these tasks to a master tradesman's gang in group C, that had a maximum of 40 staff. Both the DB and the DR during the 1950s established larger D groups at independent locations, known as Betriebswagenwerke or wagon depots. Where {{this was not the}} case, Group D was headed by another inspector to whom, {{depending on the size of}} the depot, up to three wagon foremen (Wagenmeister) reported. This group was responsible for checking reports of damage, repairing damage and defects, supervising the shunting foremen at stations, clearing up operational irregularities, refilling gas and disinfection facilities for wagons, cleaning, lighting and heating of wagons, maintenance and repair jobs, dispatching wagons to the <b>main</b> <b>repair</b> <b>shops,</b> ordering spare parts and materials for wagons, including the management of the spare parts and monitoring new systems on wagons.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, {{the last}} of over two {{thousand}} steam locomotives was built and carriage building finished in 1962, but the works was modernised {{with the addition of}} a diesel locomotive <b>repair</b> <b>shop.</b> Under BREL, new diesel shunters and 25 kV electric locomotives have been built, plus Class 56 and Class 58 diesel-electric locomotives. In July 2003 'The Plant' celebrated its 150th anniversary, with an open weekend; a link to the picture gallery for the weekend can be found below.

50|$|The {{railroad}} industry led {{the early}} {{strength of the}} economy. The Santa Fe Train Depot (still extant), with its unique architecture, serves as a visible reminder of the city's dependence on the train. During the early 20th century, the Rock Island Railroad and the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad both had depots in the city. Shawnee's major employer was the Rock Island Railroad, which had located its <b>main</b> southwestern <b>repair</b> <b>shops</b> in the city in 1896. After nearly 40 years, the railroad moved its shops to El Reno in 1937, but two major buildings remain. The Santa Fe Railroad also had <b>repair</b> <b>shops</b> {{just south of the}} city. By 2000 only a large concrete tower remained, and it was demolished that year. Some of the roundhouse buildings are now used by the city for storage and technical repair.|$|R

At these local <b>repair</b> <b>shops,</b> customers arrive with broken, but repairable, items. Customers go to the nearest open <b>repair</b> <b>shop.</b> Since they want to leave as soon as possible, an inventory of working items is kept at the <b>repair</b> <b>shops.</b> A customer immediately receives a working item from stock, provided that the stock is not empty. If a stockout occurs, the customer has to wait for a working item. The broken items are <b>repaired</b> in the <b>shop</b> and then put in stock. Sometimes, however, a broken item cannot be fixed at the local <b>repair</b> <b>shop,</b> {{and it has to be}} sent to a central <b>repair</b> <b>shop.</b> At the central <b>repair</b> <b>shop</b> the same policy with inventory and repair is used.

We analyse the security within the <b>repair</b> <b>shop</b> by applying a reduced version of the threat, vulnerability, and risk analysis (TVRA) method defined by ETSI. First, a system description of the <b>repair</b> <b>shop</b> is given. Security objectives and assets are then identified, followed by the threat and vulnerability analysis. Possible countermeasures are derived and we outline and discuss one possible approach for addressing the security in the <b>repair</b> <b>shop.</b> We find {{that many of the}} identified vulnerabilities can directly be mitigated by countermeasures and, to our surprise, we find that the handling of authentication keys is critical and may affect vehicles outside the <b>repair</b> <b>shop</b> as well.

Finally, we suggest that <b>repair</b> <b>shop</b> security should mainly be addressed at the link layer.
