With the help of these records, and by observing the times and heights of the <b>maximum</b> <b>rise</b> of a particular flood at the stations on the various tributaries, the time of arrival and height of the top of the flood at any station on the main river can be predicted with remarkable accuracy two or more days beforehand. By communicating these particulars about a high flood to places on the lower river, weir-keepers are enabled to fully open the movable weirs beforehand to permit the passage of the flood, and riparian inhabitants receive timely warning of the impending inundation.|$|E

Subsequently, this compound (still in the form of its racemate) was studied more thoroughly by Chen and co-workers, who confirmed its pressor activity, but observed that it was about one-half as potent as phenylethanolamine after i.v. administration in a cat preparation: a total dose of 5 x 10−6 M (or ~ 1 mg of the HCl salt) caused a <b>maximum</b> <b>rise</b> in blood pressure of 26 mm Hg. Additional experiments by these investigators showed that racemic N-methylphenylethanolamine also caused mydriasis in the rabbit eye (instillation of a drop of 0.05 M/L solution producing about 5 x as much dilation as the same dose of phenylethanolamine), inhibition of isolated rabbit intestine strips, and contraction of isolated guinea pig uterus.

5000|$|A {{high water}} mark is a point that {{represents}} the <b>maximum</b> <b>rise</b> of {{a body of water}} over land. Such a mark is often the result of a flood, but {{high water mark}}s may reflect an all-time high, an annual high (highest level to which water rose that year) or the high point for some other division of time. Knowledge of the high water mark for an area is useful in managing the development of that area, particularly in making preparations for flood surges. High water marks from floods have been measured for planning purposes since at least {{as far back as the}} civilizations of ancient Egypt. It is a common practice to create a physical marker indicating one or more of the highest water marks for an area, usually with a line at the level to which the water rose, and a notation of the date on which this high water mark was set. This may be a free-standing flood level sign or other marker, or it may be affixed to a building or other structure that was standing at the time of the flood that set the mark.|$|E

In the present article the zones of wave amplification in the bay are found. The first one is located near the wave running-up on the beach (in front of the bay entrance) and the other one – in the middle part of the sea basin. Wave propagation in these zones is accompanied both by significant rise and considerable fall of the sea level. Narrowing of the bay entrance and increase of the entering wave length result in decrease of the sea level <b>maximum</b> <b>rises</b> and falls. The Feodosiya Gulf in the Black Sea is considered as a real basin. In general the dynamics of the waves in the gulf is similar to wave dynamics in the model bay.

Price inflation is measured by annual Consumer Price Inflation (CPI), earnings growth by the Average Earnings index. Both as measured to September of the previous year. This resulted in a 2.7% increase for 2014, but Altmann pointed out that the RPI had risen by around 3%, so the old measure would have been more beneficial.

40|$|Measurements {{made from}} carotid pulse tracings and phonocardiograms are helpful in the {{prediction}} of severe aortic stenosis in young patients. In the elderly, however, analysis of the carotid pulse tracing and, in particular, its <b>maximum</b> rate of <b>rise</b> has proved unreliable because the range of normal values for this age group has not been established. Consequently, we studied 44 young normal and 44 older normal subjects, 15 older patients with systolic hypertension, and 36 older patients with significant aortic stenosis. Measurements obtained from the carotid pulse included the left ventricular ejection time, upstroke time, half-rise time, and the <b>maximum</b> rate of <b>rise.</b> The peak of the systolic murmur in aortic stenosis was measured phonocardiographically from the Q wave of the simultaneously recorded electrocardiogram (QP interval). The results confirm that the <b>maximum</b> rate of <b>rise</b> of the carotid pulse of normal older subjects is much more rapid than that of young subjects. Among elderly patients with aortic stenosis, the <b>maximum</b> rate of <b>rise</b> falls {{within the range of}} the normal young. Measurement of the half-rise time is imprecise, and there is considerable overlap with the normal. This is also true of left ventricular ejection time. The upstroke time is unreliable because of wave distortion produced by the arteriosclerotic vascular bed. The two most valuable and easily recorded measurements are the <b>maximum</b> rate of <b>rise</b> and the QP interval. A <b>maximum</b> rate of <b>rise</b> of more than 1000 mmHg/s and a QP interval of less than 220 ms argue strongly against the diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis.

This study aimed to compare current different diagnostic criteria for ACLF and to determine predictors of the progression into post-enrollment EASL-CLIF ACLF from ACLF at enrollment defined by APASL alone or by both APASL and CMA but not by EASL-CLIF Consortium. We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 394 eligible cirrhotic patients fulfilling at least APASL criteria for ACLF at enrollment. Patient survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and subsequently compared by log-rank test. Independent predictors of disease progression were determined using univariate analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis. The 90 -day mortality rate was 13. 1 % in patients with ACLF at enrollment defined by APASL alone, 25. 3 % in patients with ACLF at enrollment defined by both APASL and CMA but not EASL-CLIF Consortium, and 59. 3 % in patients with ACLF at enrollment defined by EASL-CLIF Consortium in addition to APASL.

Simulations for two series of anticipated transients phics. without scram (ATWS) events have been carried out for a small, hypothetical, research reactor based on the High Flux Australian Reador HIFAR using the RELAPS/MOD 3. Z computer program. The first series simulated the ATWS events associated with pump transients and the second series simulated the ATWS events associated with heat exchanger transients. In the first series, two cases were simulated: (1) the non-availability of one of the two primary pumps and (2) the non-availability of one pump and 50 % operation of the other pimp. In the second series, three cases were simulated: (1) the non-availability of one of the three heat enchanters (2) the non-availability of two of the three heat enchanters and (3) the non-availability of all the three heat enchanters. To carry out the above simulations, modifications were incorporated to the critical heat flux (CHF) correlations of the RELAP program to account for the annular geometry of the fuel elements. The results of the simulated plump transients indicated that the mass flow rate would decrease to 270 Kg/s in the first transient and to 133 Kg/s in transient 2.
