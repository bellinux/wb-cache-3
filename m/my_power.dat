5|$|I did it {{deliberately}} {{and with}} all <b>my</b> <b>power,</b> because I felt that by nothing but the sacrifice of human life would the nation be brought to realise the horrible torture our women face! If I had succeeded I am sure that forcible feeding could not in all conscience have been resorted to again.|$|E
25|$|I will do {{everything}} in <b>my</b> <b>power</b> to pass a better Philippines to the next generation.|$|E
25|$|I {{am doing}} {{everything}} in <b>my</b> <b>power</b> {{to discourage the}} use of gases and other chemicals in any war between nations. While, unfortunately, the defensive necessities of the United States call for study {{of the use of}} chemicals in warfare, I do not want the Government of the United States to do anything to aggrandize or make permanent any special bureau of the Army or the Navy engaged in these studies. I hope the time will come when the Chemical Warfare Service can be entirely abolished.|$|E
60|$|I {{saw that}} he did not believe in <b>my</b> <b>powers,</b> and became all the more {{determined}} to succeed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, Jessie, I have {{exhausted}} all <b>my</b> <b>powers</b> of persuasion. I {{leave it}} entirely to yourself {{to do as}} you think best." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I Sing the Body Electric, Especially When <b>my</b> <b>Power's</b> Out" [...] is {{a poem by}} American poet Andrea Gibson (from {{the album}} Flower Boy).|$|R
25|$|The {{only means}} {{which have been}} placed in <b>my</b> <b>power</b> of 'raising the wages of colliers' has been by endeavouring to beat down all those {{restrictions}} upon trade which tend to reduce the price to be obtained for the product of their labour, & to lower as much as may be the taxes on the commodities which they may require for use or for consumption. Beyond this I look to the forethought not yet so widely diffused in this country as in Scotland, & in some foreign lands; & I need not remind you that in order to facilitate its exercise the Government have been empowered by Legislation to become through the Dept. of the P.O. the receivers & guardians of savings.|$|E
25|$|Looking at {{that picture}} today makes me cringe. It {{was done in}} the worst {{possible}} taste. Back then I was too immature to see that. Shame on me—I should have done everything in <b>my</b> <b>power</b> to stop it. The record company came up with the idea, I think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom we had just supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' trying to do a more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! You should do something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first. Virgin Killer is none other than the demon of our time, the less compassionate side of the societies we live in today—brutally trampling upon {{the heart and soul of}} innocence.|$|E
25|$|I {{will say}} {{to you and to}} the colored race that men who bore arms and {{followed}} the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in <b>my</b> <b>power</b> to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'll {{persuade him}} to come!" [...] I said with confidence--thinking [...] "it would take all <b>my</b> <b>powers</b> of persuasion to keep him away!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 100. <b>My</b> <b>powers</b> are zero. To my {{consciousness}} {{there is almost}} no association of memory with objective visual impressions. I recollect the breakfast-table, but do not see it.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is well; {{and here}} is my {{authority}} to receive it from you. Gentlemen, will you have the kindness to see that <b>my</b> <b>powers</b> are regular and authentic?" ...|$|R
500|$|At his {{confirmation}} hearings in 2017, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch recalled being moved by reading Sumner's gravestone {{as a law}} student at Harvard. Gorsuch closed his opening statement by reading a portion of Sumner's epitaph and adding [...] "hose words stick with me. I keep them on my desk. They serve {{for me as a}} daily reminder of the law's integrity, that a useful life can be led in its service, of the hard work it takes, and an encouragement to good habits when I fail and when I falter. At the end of it all, I can ask for nothing more than to be described as he was. And if confirmed, I pledge to you that I will do everything in <b>my</b> <b>power</b> to be that man." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the midst}} of our short {{conversation}} of yesterday, & still more pleasant than short, you expressed a wish to receive a sketch in prose of the thing we desired. I am sure your kindness renders it a duty incumbent on me in return, to afford you every facility in <b>my</b> <b>power.</b> I therefore inclose two scribbles with which I would not otherwise have troubled you. That in small writing is the production of my daughter in her eleventh year, & is strictly modelled, as ar as [...] her infant talents would allow, on Dibdin's song. This may answer {{the purpose of a}} prose sketch. The other is written by a young man of twenty. It is rather unintelligible: but the two first two stanzas may afford you a hint respecting the first two designs.|$|E
500|$|The {{basis for}} this order of battle is a return {{prepared}} by General Washington on August 3. [...] It encompasses all of the units stationed in the New York area, not only {{those involved in the}} battle. [...] The total provided is a listing of all troops, not just those listed as ready for duty. [...] A substantial number of troops were sick during July and August. [...] For example, General William Heath, writing in his memoirs, recorded that about 10,000 men were sick on August 8, and Washington reported on September 2 having fewer than 20,000 men present and fit for duty. [...] Later returns were apparently impossible: Washington wrote to Congress on August 26 that [...] "he shifting and changing which the regiments have undergone of late has prevented their making proper returns, and of course puts it out of <b>my</b> <b>power</b> to transmit a general one of the army." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{it would}} {{put an end to}} Joscelind! If you can't work round to it, what's the good of being--you?" [...] And with this tribute to <b>my</b> <b>powers</b> he took his departure.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold him tight, Mak," [...] he cried, {{after several}} futile {{attempts}} to mount. [...] "I was always good at leap-frog when a schoolboy; see if I don't bring <b>my</b> <b>powers</b> into play now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I seem to {{have gone}} into this {{business}} with too much precipitation," [...] he reflected, with a deadly sigh. [...] "I fear it seems too ramified for a person of <b>my</b> <b>powers</b> of mind." ...|$|R
500|$|Press {{framing of}} Reagan changed {{from that of}} just helpmate and {{protector}} to someone with hidden power. As {{the image of her}} as a political interloper grew, she sought to explicitly deny that she was the power behind the throne. At the end of her time as First Lady, however, she said that her husband had not been well-served by his staff. She acknowledged her role in reaction in influencing him on personnel decisions, saying [...] "In no way do I apologize for it." [...] She wrote in her memoirs, [...] "I don't think I was as bad, or as extreme in <b>my</b> <b>power</b> or my weakness, as I was depicted," [...] but went on, [...] "However the first lady fits in, she has a unique and important role to play in looking after her husband. And it's only natural that she'll let him know what she thinks. I always did that for Ronnie, and I always will." ...|$|E
500|$|Seacole visited Nightingale at the Barrack Hospital in Scutari, {{where she}} asked for a bed for the night, because she {{intended}} to travel to Balaclava {{the next day to}} join her business partner. In her memoirs, she reported that her meeting with Nightingale was friendly, with Nightingale asking [...] "What do you want, Mrs. Seacole? Anything we can do for you? If it lies in <b>my</b> <b>power,</b> I shall be very happy." [...] Seacole told her of her [...] "dread of the night journey by caique" [...] and the improbability of being able to find the Hollander in the dark. A bed was then found for her and breakfast sent her in the morning, with a [...] "kind message" [...] from Mrs. Bracebridge, Nightingale's helper. A footnote in the memoir states that Seacole subsequently [...] "saw much of Miss Nightingale at Balaclava," [...] but no further meetings are recorded in the text.|$|E
500|$|Questlove was the [...] "musical powerhouse" [...] behind {{several of}} the Soulquarians' {{projects}} during the late 1990s and early 2000s, including Voodoo and Things Fall Apart. In a 2002 interview, he told critic Jim DeRogatis {{about his role in}} recording Voodoo and being a part of the Soulquarians, stating [...] "I tried to do all in <b>my</b> <b>power</b> that I could to bring people together – to bring Common to Electric Lady, have him record here whenever so that he could record with some of these other artists. You'd just come into [...] A Room, you don't even know who has a session, but you call me: 'Who's down there?' 'Common's in there today'. So you come down, you order some food, sit down and bulls—, watch a movie, and then it's, 'Let's play something'. And I say, 'Who wants this ?' And it would be, 'I want it!' 'No, I want it!'". Questlove has referred to the recording experience at the studio as a [...] "left-of-center black music renaissance".|$|E
6000|$|Max. Yes! here he is! I can endure {{no longer}} [...] To creep on tiptoe round this house, and lurk [...] In ambush for a {{favourable}} moment. [...] This loitering, this suspense exceeds <b>my</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{for your}} sister, don't {{talk to me}} about her. I don't care two straws about your sister. You must excuse me, Major Grantly, but Lady Hartletop is really too big for <b>my</b> <b>powers</b> of vision." ...|$|R
60|$|LUBIN. Are you? [Looking at him pleasantly] Yes: {{of course}} you are. I never forget a face. But [with an arch turn of his eyes to Savvy] your pretty niece engaged all <b>my</b> <b>powers</b> of vision.|$|R
500|$|Sullivan {{wished to}} produce further serious works with Gilbert. He had collaborated {{with no other}} {{librettist}} since 1875. But Gilbert felt that the reaction to The Yeomen of the Guard had [...] "not been so convincing as to warrant us in assuming that the public want something more earnest still." [...] He proposed instead that Sullivan should go ahead with his plan to write a grand opera, but should continue also to compose comic works for the Savoy. Sullivan was not immediately persuaded. He replied, [...] "I have lost the liking for writing comic opera, and entertain very grave doubts as to <b>my</b> <b>power</b> of doing it." [...] Nevertheless, Sullivan soon commissioned a grand opera libretto from Julian Sturgis (who was recommended by Gilbert), while suggesting to Gilbert that he revive an old idea for an opera set in colourful Venice. The comic opera was completed first: The Gondoliers (1889) was a piece described by Gervase Hughes as a pinnacle of Sullivan's achievement. [...] It was the last great Gilbert and Sullivan success.|$|E
500|$|During the June 1964 National Governors' Conference, 13 of 16 Republican {{governors}} present {{were opposed}} to Goldwater; their leaders were Jim Rhodes of Ohio, Nelson Rockefeller of New York (whose own campaign had just stalled out with a loss to Goldwater in the California primary), William Scranton of Pennsylvania, and Romney. [...] In an unusual Sunday press conference, Romney declared, [...] "If [...] views deviate as indicated from the heritage of our party, I will do everything within <b>my</b> <b>power</b> {{to keep him from}} becoming the party's presidential nominee." [...] Romney had, however, previously vowed to Michigan voters that he would not run for president in 1964. [...] Detroit newspapers indicated they would not support him in any such bid, and Romney quickly decided to honor his pledge {{to stay out of the}} contest. [...] Scranton entered instead, but Goldwater prevailed decisively at the 1964 Republican National Convention. [...] Romney's name was entered into nomination as a favorite son by U.S. Representative Gerald Ford of Michigan (who had not wanted to choose between candidates during the primary campaign) and he received the votes of 41delegates in the roll call (40 of Michigan's 48 and one from Kansas).|$|E
500|$|Boulton {{helped found}} the New Street Theatre in 1774, and later wrote that having a theatre {{encouraged}} well-to-do visitors to come to Birmingham, and {{to spend more money}} than they would have otherwise. [...] Boulton attempted to have the theatre recognised as a patent theatre with a Royal Patent, entitled to present serious drama; he failed in 1779 but succeeded in 1807. [...] He also supported Birmingham's Oratorio Choral Society, and collaborated with button maker and amateur musical promoter Joseph Moore to put on a series of private concerts in 1799. [...] He maintained a pew at St Paul's Church, Birmingham, a centre of musical excellence. [...] When performances of the Messiah were organised at Westminster Abbey in 1784 in the (incorrect) belief it was the centennial of Handel's birth and the (correct) belief that it was the 25thanniversary of his death, Boulton attended and wrote, [...] "I scarcely know which was grandest, the sounds or the scene. [...] Both was transcendibly fine that it is not in <b>my</b> <b>power</b> of words to describe. [...] In the grand Halleluja my soul almost ascended from my body." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well,” he returned, “I {{guess you}} know, and if I could let you fix me we’d {{probably}} have some big times. But I seem to strike opportunities—well, {{in excess of}} <b>my</b> <b>powers.</b> I don’t seem able to respond.” ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{received}} {{this in the}} same manner as before, from which it appeared that nothing I wrote could surprise her. Her belief in <b>my</b> <b>powers</b> was quite boundless. Father was inclined to ask, [...] "What's the good of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{they chose}} {{me to be}} the {{servitor}} of the noble lady is beyond <b>my</b> <b>powers</b> to discover. Our Lady of Loretto! I am not the person to be sent for, when the state wishes to part two lovers!" ...|$|R
500|$|By now {{desperate for}} some {{profitable}} activity, Morrell made some money by displaying Dako and Monday to a fascinated public. The only maritime opportunity available {{was to take}} a cargo to Cádiz, which he was obliged to accept. [...] He left Manila on January 13, 1831, taking his captives with him. When Antarctic reached Cádiz five months later the port was under quarantine and closed. He was forced to discharge the cargo in Bordeaux, where Dako and Monday, rumored in the town to be cannibals, again attracted great curiosity. [...] Antarctic finally reached New York on August 27, 1831; [...] despite his lack of commercial success, Morrell remained upbeat about future prospects in the Pacific. [...] "I could, with only a modest share of patronage... open a new avenue of trade more lucrative than any that our country has ever yet enjoyed, and further, {{it would be in}} <b>my</b> <b>power,</b> and mine alone, to secure the monopoly for any term I pleased." [...] In the final paragraph of his account of the Morrell records that his wife's father, her aunt and her aunt's child had all died during his absence, as had one of Morrell's cousins and her husband.|$|E
500|$|Peel (presumably one of {{the liberal}} proprietors with {{excellent}} regulations who assured his support) introduced his Bill in 1802. [...] In doing so Peel {{said that he was}} convinced of the existence of gross mismanagement in his own factories, and having no time to set them in order himself, was getting an Act of Parliament passed to do it for him [...] but (given his dealings with the Manchester Board of Health) this may well have been a pleasantry, rather than the whole truth[...] [...] In 1816 Peel introduced a further Factory Bill; his explanation to the consequent Select Committee of the need for further legislation included this account of the origins of the 1802 Act: The house in which I have a concern gave employment at one time to near one thousand children of this description. [...] Having other pursuits, it was not often in <b>my</b> <b>power</b> to visit the factories, but whenever such visits were made, I was struck with the uniform appearance of bad health, and, in many cases, stinted growth of the children; the hours of labour were regulated by the interest of the overseer, whose remuneration depending on the quantity of the work done, he was often induced to make the poor children work excessive hours, and to stop their complaints by trifling bribes ...|$|E
500|$|Williams {{declared}} {{his intention to}} stand for election on 15 May 1860, one day after Müller. In his written submission to Convocation, he emphasised his suitability for appointment {{in the light of}} Boden's missionary wishes. After giving details of his life and career, particularly his experience in Sanskrit obtained at Haileybury, he stated that for the past 14 years [...] "the one idea of my life has been to make myself thoroughly conversant with Sanskrit, and by every means in <b>my</b> <b>power</b> to facilitate the study of its literature." [...] He assured voters that, if elected, [...] "my utmost energies shall be devoted to the one object which its Founder had in view;—namely The promotion of a more general and critical knowledge of the Sanskrit language, as a means of enabling Englishmen to proceed in the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian religion. Unlike Müller, he regarded the study of Sanskrit [...] "as chiefly a means to the missionary conversion of the Hindus rather than as an end in itself", as Dowling puts it. In this way, Dowling says, he could attempt to deflect attention from his [...] "modest abilities in classical Sanskrit" [...] when compared to Müller's [...] "internationally acknowledged achievements". Moreover, the appeal to Boden's original intentions came during a period when Convocation tended to pay little attention to the expressed wishes of benefactors.|$|E
6000|$|... "By <b>my</b> <b>powers</b> as a mortal," [...] she said, marveling {{even then}} at the strange speech, [...] "I command you to become a brave and gallant youth--handsome, strong, fearless! And such shall you remain for the space of one year." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>powers</b> as a {{linguist}} may not {{perhaps be}} above the average, nevertheless I confess {{to a considerable}} facility in the acquisition of languages. Russian I already knew very well, having, as before intimated, spent a considerable time in St. Petersburg.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! You want my advice?" [...] Westover {{still felt}} {{physically}} incapable of the indignation which he strongly imagined. [...] "I don't {{know what to}} say to you, Durgin. You transcend <b>my</b> <b>powers.</b> Are you able to see this whole thing yourself?" ...|$|R
