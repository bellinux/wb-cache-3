25|$|Nobel laureate {{economist}} Milton Friedman, {{author of}} A Monetary History of the United States, {{on the other}} hand, blamed this prolonged economic crisis on {{the imposition of a}} new gold standard, part of which he referred to by its traditional name, The Crime of 1873. This forced shift into a currency whose supply was limited by nature, unable to expand with demand, caused a series of economic and monetary contractions that plagued the entire period of the Long Depression. Murray Rothbard, in his book History of <b>Money</b> <b>and</b> <b>Banking</b> of the United States, argues that the long depression was only a misunderstood recession since real wages and production were actually increasing throughout the period. Like Friedman, he attributes falling prices to the resumption of a deflationary gold standard in the U.S. after the Civil War.|$|E
