5|$|Additional live {{specimens}} {{recovered in}} 2010 and 2011 from Oregon were all found deep inside caves. Except {{for a single}} juvenile specimen recovered from the understory debris of old growth redwood forests of northwest California, none have been found outside the caves. This specimen has different markings than T. marchingtoni and <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> new undescribed species.|$|E
5|$|The Asian subspecies, the {{relatively}} large intermedius also differs in structure and voice, and <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> distinct species.

5|$|Another sauropod of the Nemegt-Formation, Nemegtosaurus, {{is known}} {{only from a}} skull. Opisthocoelicaudia, on the other hand, lacks both the skull and neck, precluding a direct {{comparison}} and leading to suspicions that it <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> synonym of Nemegtosaurus. According to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the oldest name has priority over younger synonyms – if Opisthocoelicaudia would {{be shown to be}} a synonym of Nemegtosaurus, the name Nemegtosaurus would remain valid while Opisthocoelicaudia would become invalid.|$|E

5|$|Dinheirosaurus is a genus of diplodocid sauropod dinosaur that {{is known}} from fossils {{uncovered}} in modern-day Portugal. It <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> species of Supersaurus. The only species is Dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis, first described by José Bonaparte and Octávio Mateus in 1999 for vertebrae and some other material from the Lourinhã Formation. Although the precise age of the formation is not known, it can be dated around the early Tithonian of the Late Jurassic.|$|E
5|$|Interestingly, {{although}} the centrum of Hatzegopteryx {{is much more}} robust than Arambourgiania, their ratios of bone radius to bone thickness (R/t) are roughly the same (9.45 for Hatzegopteryx and 9.9 for Arambourgiania). This <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> compromise between increasing bending strength and buckling strength; higher R/t ratios lead to improved bending strength, but weaker buckling strength. To compensate for this, Hatzegopteryx shows {{a number of other}} adaptations to improve buckling strength, namely the distinctive internal structures of the bones and the large articular joints of the vertebrae, the latter of which helps to distribute stress.|$|E

5|$|Potamon fluviatile is at {{the western}} {{distributional}} limit of the genus Potamon.

The populations of P.fluviatile on the Peloponnese, Kefalonia, and Zakynthos <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> separate, cryptic species, and the population from the Peloponnese was described in 2010 as P.pelops.|$|E
5|$|Another 2016 {{study used}} laser-stimulated {{fluorescence}} imaging {{to analyze the}} internal structure of the bristles. The highly cornified bristles are arranged in tight clusters of three to six individual bristles, with each bristle being filled with pulp. The authors considered the bristles as being homologous to the quills of Tianyulong, the elongated broad filamentous feathers (EBFFs) of Beipiaosaurus, and possibly the feathers of birds as well. Similar bristles are found in extant birds such as the horned screamer; these structures differ from feathers in {{that they do not}} develop from a follicle, but both arise from discrete cell populations. A darkened soft-tissue structure was also found near the jugal horn; this <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> keratinous sheath or a skin flap.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy IV, {{the player}} {{controls}} a large {{cast of characters}} and completes quests to advance the story. Characters move and interact with people and enemies on a field map, which <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> variety of settings, such as towers, caves, and forests. Travel between areas occurs on a world map. The player can use towns to replenish strength, buy equipment, and discover clues about their next destination. Conversely, the player fights monsters at random intervals on the world map and in dungeons. In battle, the player has the option to fight, use magic or an item, retreat, change character positions, parry, or pause. Certain characters have special abilities. The game {{was the first in}} the series to allow the player to control up to five characters in their party; previous games had limited the party to four.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the mention of several colours, authors such as Walter Rothschild claimed that the Gelderland journal {{described}} the bird as entirely blue-grey, and it was restored this way in Rothschild's 1907 book Extinct Birds. Later examination of the journal by Julian Hume has revealed only {{a description of the}} dodo. He suggested that the distinctively drawn facial mask <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> separate colour. The head was evidently blue, and in 2007, Hume suggested the beak may have been red, {{and the rest of the}} plumage greyish or blackish, which also occurs in other members of Psittaculini.|$|E
5|$|Most {{commonly}} known from western North America, the species was reported growing on sandy soil in Natal Dunes State Park {{in the northeastern}} Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte in 2008. The fruit bodies {{were associated with the}} roots of the native tree species Eugenia brasiliensis. Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for this disjunct distribution: the species may have been present before the Americas separated; it may have been introduced to Brazil by human activity, and subsequently adapted to the environment there; or the North and South American populations <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> cryptic species complex—appearing morphologically similar but genetically distinct. The Brazilian population has not been compared genetically with North American specimens.|$|E
5|$|Representations of lions {{date back}} to the early Upper Paleolithic. The lioness-headed ivory carving from Vogelherd cave in the Swabian Alb in southwestern Germany, dubbed Löwenmensch (lion-human) in German. The {{sculpture}} has been determined to be at least 32,000years old from the Aurignacian culture, but it may date to as early as 40,000 years ago. The sculpture has been interpreted as anthropomorphic, giving human characteristics to an animal, however, it also <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> deity. Two lions were depicted mating in the Chamber of Felines in 15,000-year-old Paleolithic cave paintings in the Lascaux caves. Cave lions also are depicted in the Chauvet Cave, discovered in 1994; this has been dated at 32,000years of age, though it may be of similar or younger age to Lascaux.|$|E

However, if we are prepared to admit (though we should not do) this method of reasoning as valid, I'll {{show that the}} analogy between life and information to the effect that artificial mind <b>may</b> <b>represents</b> <b>an</b> expected advance in the life evolution in Universe seems suggest some type of reductionism of life to information, but biology respectively chemistry or physics are not reductionist, contrary to what seems to be suggested by the analogy between life and information...|$|R
5|$|The {{geometry}} of a back country ski {{depends on its}} purpose—skis suited for forested areas where loose powder can predominate may be shorter and wider than those selected for open, exposed areas where compacted snow may prevail. Sidecut on Telemark skis promotes turning in forest and rugged terrain. Width and short length aid turning in loose and deep snow. Longer, narrower and more rigid skis with sharp edges are suited for snow that has been compacted by wind or freeze-thaw. Touring ski design <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> general-purpose compromise among these different ski conditions, plus being acceptable for use in groomed tracks. Traction may come from a textured or waxed grip zone, as with classic skis, or from ski skins, which are applied to the ski bottom for long, steep ascents and have hairs or mechanical texture that prevents sliding backwards.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} other red-pored, bluing boletes {{that could be}} {{confused}} with S.amygdalinus. The poisonous European species Rubroboletus satanas and its North American counterpart R.eastwoodiae have lighter colored caps and a reticulate pattern on the stipe. B.subvelutipes is a highly variable species from eastern North America that includes red in its range of cap colors, and has a fuzzy coating of hairs near the base of its stipe; it <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> group of species. Another similar species is B.luridiformis, found in North America and Northern Europe under both broadleaf trees and conifers. Unlike S.amygdalinus, however, B.luridiformis has a dark brown to nearly blackish-brown cap, and a yellow stipe with a dense covering of red pruina (dots).|$|E
5|$|At Copán ritual offerings were {{deposited}} {{around the}} city's stelae {{until at least}} 1000, which may represent the offerings of a surviving elite that still remembered its ancestors, or {{may be due to}} highland Maya still regarding the city as a place of pilgrimage long after it had fallen into ruin. A small number of sculpted stelae once stood at Cerro Quiac in the Guatemalan Highlands, and are presumed to have been erected by Mam Maya in the 13th or 14th century. At Lamanai in Belize, Classic period stelae were repositioned upon two small Postclassic platforms dating to the 15th or 16th century. At La Milpa, also in Belize, at around the time of Spanish contact in the late 16th century a tiny remnant Maya population started to make offerings of Conquest-period pottery to stelae, perhaps in an effort to invoke the ancestors to help resist the Spanish onslaught. A plain stela in Twin Pyramid Group R at Tikal was removed by the local inhabitants some time during the Postclassic; its accompanying altar was also moved but abandoned some distance from its original location. Some plain stelae were raised at Topoxté in the Petén Lakes region of Guatemala in the Postclassic; these were perhaps covered in stucco and painted. This <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> revival of the katun-ending ceremonies that occurred in the Classic Period, and reflected ties with the northern Yucatán.|$|E

5|$|Ceratopsia {{appears to}} have {{originated}} in Asia, as all of the earliest members are found there. Fragmentary remains, including teeth, which appear to be neoceratopsian, are found in North America from the Albian stage (112 to 100 million years ago), indicating that the group had dispersed across {{what is now the}} Bering Strait {{by the middle of the}} Cretaceous Period. Almost all leptoceratopsids are North American, aside from Udanoceratops, which <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> separate dispersal event, back into Asia. Ceratopsids and their immediate ancestors, such as Zuniceratops, were unknown outside of western North America, and were presumed endemic to that continent. The traditional view that ceratopsoids originated in North America was called into question by the 2009 discovery of better specimens of the dubious Asian form Turanoceratops, which confirmed it as a ceratopsid. It is unknown whether this indicates ceratopsids actually originated in Asia, or if the Turanoceratops immigrated from North America.|$|E
5|$|Exactly {{who owned}} the Hoxne Hoard, and their reasons for burying it, are not known, and {{probably}} never will be. However, the hoard itself and its context provide some important clues. The hoard evidently was buried carefully, some distance from any buildings. The hoard very likely represents {{only a portion of}} the precious-metal wealth of the person, or people, who owned it; many common types of jewellery are missing, as are large tableware items such as those found in the Mildenhall Treasure. It is unlikely that anyone would have possessed the rich gold and silver items found in the Hoxne Hoard without owning items in those other categories. Whoever owned the hoard also would have had wealth in the form of land, livestock, buildings, furniture, and clothing. At most, the Hoxne Hoard represents a moderate portion of the wealth of someone rich; conversely, it <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> minuscule fraction of the wealth of a family that was incredibly wealthy.|$|E
5|$|One {{specimen}} {{discovered at}} the Cifelli #2 quarry, a right dentary catalogued as CEUM 34447, is unusual {{compared to other}} Eolambia specimens, including both adults and juveniles. While the ratio between the mid-point depth and overall length of the dentaries in other individuals generally ranges from 0.19 to 0.24, the same value in CEUM 34447 is 0.31, making it unusually deep. The dentary also does not deepen substantially at the front end, and thus lacks one of the distinguishing traits of Eolambia dentaries. However, the other distinguishing trait, which is {{the expansion of the}} front end of the coronoid process, is present in the specimen. Although it is possible that this individual represents an unusual Eolambia specimen, McDonald and colleagues cautioned that it <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> distinct hadrosauroid that differs in the morphology of the dentary from Eolambia (albeit one that is not suggested by any of the other materials at the quarry). Thus, they regarded it as an indeterminate basal hadrosauroid.|$|E
