Using this powder, single crystals {{can be grown}} from the melt, solution, or vapor phase (e.g. with the Bridgman–Stockbarger technique). Melt growth results in the worst crystalline quality with a mosaic spread in the X-ray reflection of about 1°. The best crystals are obtained from the liquid phase, but the growth is impracticably slow – several months for a 5–10mm crystal. Growth from the vapor phase is a reasonable compromise in terms of speed and quality. Adamantane is sublimed in a quartz tube placed in a furnace, which is equipped with several heaters maintaining a certain temperature gradient (about 10°C/cm for adamantane) along the tube.

Even during the current Pu'u 'Ō'ō-Kupaianaha eruption (1983 -present), a surge in supply occurred from 2003 - 2007. This surge was accompanied by summit inflation, increased CO 2 emissions, and finally culminated in a dike intrusion and surface eruption.

5000|$|Zone melting (or zone {{refining}} or floating zone process or travelling <b>melting</b> <b>zone)</b> {{is a group}} of similar methods of purifying crystals, in which a narrow region of a crystal is melted, and this molten zone is moved along the crystal.

The impurities concentrate in the melt, and are moved to one end of the ingot. Zone refining was invented by John Desmond Bernal and further developed by William Gardner Pfann in Bell Labs as a method to prepare high purity materials, mainly semiconductors, for manufacturing transistors.

From a suite of 45 steady-state numerical experiments, we derive complete scaling laws for the total rate of melting M and the height H and width W of the topographic swell as functions of the lithospheric thickness zl and the plume's maximum potential temperature θi, thermal buoyancy flux B, and minimum viscosity ηp. Assuming 1500 °C<θi< 1600 °C, the observed values of M, H and W can only be matched if zl≤ 89 km, 2200 kg s− 1 ≤B≤ 3500 kg s− 1, and ηp≥ 5 × 1017 Pas. We study a reference Hawaiian model satisfying these constraints. The depletion anomaly is narrower than the thermal anomaly, and carries 24 % of the total (thermal plus depletion) buoyancy flux. Its buoyancy contributes 350 m of the uplift along the swell axis, and reduces the geoid/topography ratio by 16 % relative to a model without depletion buoyancy. All the material that melts comes from the hottest central part of the plume, and no direct melting of the asthenosphere or lithosphere occurs.
