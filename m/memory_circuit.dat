40|$|Abstract—Exponential {{increase}} in leakage power {{has emerged as}} a major barrier to technology scaling. Existing circuit techniques for leakage reduction either suffer from reduced effectiveness at nanometer technologies or affect performance and gate-oxide reliability. In this paper, we propose application of a specific carbon nanotube (CNT) -based nano-electromechanical switch as a leakage-control structure in logic and <b>memory</b> <b>circuits.</b> In case of <b>memory</b> <b>circuits,</b> we demonstrate that the proposed hybridization can be employed to reduce both cell leakage and bitline leakage, thereby improving the read noise margin as well. Due to the unique electromechanical properties of CNTs, these switches have high current-carrying capacity, extremely low leakage current, and low operating voltages. Moreover, they can act as nonvolatile memory elements, which can be exploited for data retention of important registers and latches during power down. Simulation results for a set of benchmark circuits show that we can obtain sev-eral orders of magnitude improvement in leakage saving in logic circuits at iso-performance compared to existing multi-threshold CMOS technique. In <b>memory</b> <b>circuits,</b> simulations show 19 reduction in standby leakage and 55 reduction in bitline leakage compared with the best existing techniques.

Both logic and <b>memory</b> <b>circuits</b> have seen their performance impacted due to these variations.

For logic circuits, general statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) techniques have emerged to calculate the probability density function (PDF) of the circuit delay.

5000|$|Frequently, {{secondary}} to thiamine deficiency and subsequent cytotoxic edema in Wernicke's encephalopathy, patients will have marked degeneration of the mamillary bodies. Thiamine (vitamin B1) {{is an essential}} coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism and is also a regulator of osmotic gradient. Its deficiency may cause swelling of the intracellular space and local disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Brain tissue is very sensitive to changes in electrolytes and pressure and edema can be cytotoxic. In Wernicke's this occurs specifically in the mammillary bodies, medial thalami, tectal plate, and periaqueductal areas. Sufferers may also exhibit a dislike for sunlight and so may wish to stay indoors with the lights off. The mechanism of this degeneration is unknown, but it supports the current neurological theory that the mammillary bodies {{play a role in}} various [...] "memory circuits" [...] within the brain.
