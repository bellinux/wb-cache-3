5|$|Connecticut {{took over}} {{at their own}} 32-yard line and, after {{throwing}} only twopasses in the first threequarters, completed threepasses over 10yards apiece to <b>move</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> field. On a 2nd-and-5 from the Buffalo 15-yard line, Tyler Lorenzen scored his second rushing touchdown of the game. UConn's lead was extended to 31–20 with less than fiveminutes left in the game.|$|E
5|$|The French van, pounded by British {{fire from}} both sides, {{had begun to}} surrender, and the victorious British ships {{continued}} to <b>move</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> line, bringing Brueys's 118-gun flagship Orient under constant heavy fire. Orient caught fire under this bombardment, and later exploded. Nelson briefly came on deck to direct the battle, but returned to the surgeon after watching the destruction of Orient.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} Clarke to the ODI {{team for the}} Pakistan series also saw White <b>move</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> order again, {{although}} batting at number five, he made his second international century in the first match, scoring 105 from 88 balls to help drive Australia to victory. White continued to perform well with the bat in the series, making a half-century in the second match and making decent totals {{in a number of}} the other games as Australia swept the series 5–0.|$|E

5|$|Most fish move by {{alternately}} contracting paired sets {{of muscles}} {{on either side}} of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that <b>move</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is applied to the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's fins function like an airplane's flaps. Fins also increase the tail's surface area, increasing speed. The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water. Since body tissue is denser than water, fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fish have an internal organ called a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases.|$|E
5|$|Receiving {{the ball}} at their own 8-yard line {{following}} a penalty on the kickoff return, Buffalo began to <b>move</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> field, with Drew Willy completing a 38-yard pass to wideout Brett Hamlin and a 29-yard pass to Naaman Roosevelt. On 3rd-and-4 from the Connecticut 19-yard line, Willy completed a ten-yard pass to James Starks, giving the Bulls a 1st-and-goal. Starks rushed for fouryards on firstdown; on seconddown, Willy threw an incomplete pass intended for Roosevelt. On 3rd-and-goal from the Husky 5-yard line, Willy attempted a pass that was deflected and intercepted by UConn safety Dahna Deleston, who returned the ball 100yards for the game-sealing touchdown. UConn won the game 38–20.|$|E
5|$|In Villers-Bocage, A Company of the 1/7th Queen's {{secured the}} area around the railway station and B and C {{companies}} occupied {{the east side of the}} town. German infantry had entered the town and house-to-house fighting began. Two German tanks were damaged and driven off, but the 1/7th Queen's infantry companies became mingled and were ordered to fall back to reorganise. A Company was ordered back to the railway station, C Company was assigned the north-eastern edge of the town and D Company the south-eastern edge. B Company was placed in reserve and the battalion anti-tank guns were distributed along the front line. At the town square an ambush was laid by the 4th CLY. A Sherman Firefly, several Cromwells, a 6-pounder anti-tank gun and infantry of the 1/7th Queen's with PIATs, waited for German tanks to <b>move</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> main street. To the west of the town, the Germans attacked the 1/5th Queen's near Livry and lost a tank.|$|E

5|$|Since so {{many new}} sets had to be created, the {{production}} commenced filming with location photography. Four days were spent in the Titan Missile Museum, south of Tucson, Arizona—the disarmed nuclear missile was fitted with a fiberglass capsule shell to stand in for the Phoenixs booster and command module. The old missile silo provided a large set that the budget would have prohibited building from scratch, but the small size created difficulties. Each camera move was planned in advance to work around areas where the lighting would be added, and electricians and grips donned rock-climbing harnesses to <b>move</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> shaft and attach the lights. To give greater dimension to the rocket and lend the missile a futuristic appearance, Leonetti chose to offset the missile's metallic surface with complementary colors. Using different-colored gels made the rocket appear longer than it actually was; to complete the effect, shots from the Phoenixs nose downwards and from the engines up were filmed with a 30mm lens to lengthen the missile.|$|E
5|$|Moreau had an {{opportunity}} to smash one of the enemy forces, but he moved slowly. Saint-Cyr started from Oberkirch on 2 July. The next day his wing moved in an easterly direction, seizing enemy positions at Oppenau, on the Kniebis Mountain and at Freudenstadt. This deep thrust completely separated Fröhlich {{from the rest of the}} Army of the Upper Rhine. Latour and Sztáray tried to hold a position behind the Murg River but Desaix attacked them in the Battle of Rastatt on 5 July. To assist in this operation, Moreau directed Saint-Cyr to <b>move</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Murg valley. On the same day as Rastatt, Taponier's division captured Gernsbach. At Rastatt, the French employed 19,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry to spar with 6,000 Austrians led by Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg and Johann Mészáros von Szoboszló. The French turned both Austrian flanks, forcing their enemies to pull back east toward Ettlingen. Casualties on both sides were light. The Austrians lost 200 men and three guns captured. At Ettlingen Latour found the archduke's leading elements, with the main body still a few days distant. The Austrians were in a vulnerable situation but Moreau delayed for three days at Rastatt, allowing Charles to bring up 25 battalions and 39 squadrons.|$|E

25|$|Note {{that these}} passivized {{sentences}} get progressively more ungrammatical in English as they <b>move</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> accessibility hierarchy; the last two, in particular, are so ungrammatical {{as to be}} almost unparsable by English speakers. However, those languages with severe restrictions on which roles can be relativized are precisely those that can passivize almost any position, and hence the last two sentences would be normal in these languages.|$|E

25|$|When swimming, {{the waves}} become larger as they <b>move</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> snake's body, and the wave travels {{backwards}} {{faster than the}} snake moves forwards. Thrust is generated by pushing their body against the water, resulting in the observed slip. In spite of overall similarities, {{studies show that the}} pattern of muscle activation is different in aquatic versus terrestrial lateral undulation, which justifies calling them separate modes. All snakes can laterally undulate forward (with backward-moving waves), but only sea snakes have been observed reversing the motion (moving backwards with forward-moving waves).|$|E

25|$|While battles raged at the {{passes on}} South Mountain, Jackson had methodically {{positioned}} his artillery around Harpers Ferry. This included four Parrott rifles {{to the summit}} of Maryland Heights, a task that required 200 men wrestling the ropes of each gun. Although Jackson wanted all of his guns to open fire simultaneously, Walker on Loudoun Heights grew impatient and began an ineffectual bombardment with five guns shortly after 1 p.m. Jackson ordered A.P. Hill to <b>move</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{west bank of the}} Shenandoah in preparation for a flank attack on the Federal left the next morning.|$|E
25|$|Vaughan captained England in 51 Tests between 2003 and 2008, winning 26 (a {{national}} record) {{and losing}} 11; England won all seven home Tests of the 2004 summer under Vaughan, and {{the pinnacle of}} his captaincy career came with a 2–1 victory in the 2005 Ashes, England's first Ashes victory since 1986/87. However, a recurring knee injury, his decision to <b>move</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> batting order to accommodate other openers (Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook) and the pressures of captaincy took their toll on Vaughan's batting during {{the latter part of}} his career: in Tests he averaged 50.95 when not captain, and 36.02 as captain. Vaughan announced his retirement from first-class cricket on 30 June 2009.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Leftwich was sacked {{from behind and}} fumbled the ball. Ronde Barber picked up the ball, and ran 41 yards for Tampa Bay's second touchdown. On Atlanta's next drive, Warrick Dunn fumbled at the 45-yard line. Atlanta {{challenged}} the ruling, and the call on the field was overturned and ruled an incomplete pass. The following play, Roddy White fumbled, and Brian Kelly recovered for Tampa Bay. He lateraled to Cato June, who then lost the ball. Despite an instant replay challenge by Tampa Bay, the ruling on the field was upheld. Atlanta, however, was unable to <b>move</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> field, and Tampa Bay took a 14–0 lead into halftime.|$|E

25|$|For both Jupiter and Saturn, {{transport}} of plasma {{from the inner}} to the outer parts of the magnetosphere {{is thought to be}} related to interchange instability. In the case of Saturn, magnetic flux tubes loaded with cold, waterrich plasma interchange with flux tubes filled with hot plasma arriving from the outer magnetosphere. The instability is driven by centrifugal force exerted by the plasma on the magnetic field. The cold plasma is eventually removed from the magnetosphere by plasmoids formed when the magnetic field reconnects in the magnetotail. The plasmoids <b>move</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> tail and escape from the magnetosphere. The reconnection or substorm process is thought to be {{under the control of the}} solar wind and Saturn's largest moon Titan, which orbits near the outer boundary of the magnetosphere.|$|E
25|$|The two Allied columns {{advanced}} towards Djebel Abiod and Beja, {{under attack}} from the Luftwaffe, which had local air superiority, because Allied aircraft had to fly from distant bases in Algeria. On the northern road, the leading elements of the 36th Brigade made rapid progress until 17 November, when they met a mixed force of 17 tanks, 400 paratroops and self-propelled guns at Djebel Abiod. The British knocked out eleven tanks but having no tank support, were held up for nine days. The Allied columns concentrated at Djebel Abiod and Beja, preparing for an assault on 24 November. The 36th Brigade (Brigadier A.L. Kent-Lemon) was to advance from Djebel Abiod towards Mateur and 11th Brigade was to <b>move</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> valley of the river Merjerda, to take Majaz al Bab (also Medjez el Bab or Medjez) and thence to Tebourba, Djedeida and Tunis.|$|E
25|$|During the {{fighting}} on Maryland Heights, the other Confederate columns arrived and were astonished {{to see that}} critical positions {{to the west and}} south of town were not defended. Jackson methodically positioned his artillery around Harpers Ferry and ordered Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill to <b>move</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> west bank of the Shenandoah River in preparation for a flank attack on the Federal left the next morning. By the morning of September 15, Jackson had positioned nearly 50 guns on Maryland Heights and at the base of Loudoun Heights. He began a fierce artillery barrage from all sides and ordered an infantry assault. Miles realized that the situation was hopeless and agreed with his subordinates to raise the white flag of surrender. Before he could surrender personally, he was mortally wounded by an artillery shell and died the next day. After processing more than 12,000 Union prisoners, Jackson's men then rushed to Sharpsburg, Maryland, to rejoin Lee for the Battle of Antietam.|$|E
