2500|$|In August, {{after almost}} 18 months abroad, the {{battalion}} was withdrawn back to Australia for rest and reorganisation on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland. At {{this time the}} battalion had an authorised strength of 803 personnel and was organised into five companies: one headquarters company and four rifle companies (designated 'A' to 'D'). Headquarters company consisted of six platoons, numbered 1 to 6, fulfilling different support functions including signals, mortar, <b>medium</b> <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire</b> support, anti-tank, pioneer and transport. Each of the rifle companies consisted of three platoons, numbered consecutively throughout the battalion from 7 Platoon to 18 Platoon. Their stay in Australia proved short for the 15th Brigade as in April 1945 they received orders to rejoin the 3rd Division which {{was at the time}} on Bougainville as part of the II Corps; the Australians having taken over responsibility for the island from the Americans in November 1944. Following fighting around Slater's Knoll the 15th Brigade moved forward and relieved the 7th Brigade in the southern sector of the island and shortly afterwards resumed the advance along the axis of the Buin Road, crossing the Hongorai, Hari and Mobiai rivers before being relieved on 1 July by the 29th Brigade. [...] During this time the 57th/60th took part in the Battle of the Hongorai River, as well as the advance to the Mivo, undertaking a diversionary drive along the Commando Road on the left flank of the brigade's main effort.|$|E

As the 16th HLI had crept forward before the lift of the bombardment, <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire</b> had begun from the trenches and the château. The men rose to charge when the bombardment lifted and a great volume of <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire</b> met them, from emplacements which were invisible to the artillery observers watching the attack. The infantry were stopped at the wire and found that every gap was covered by a machine-gun.
