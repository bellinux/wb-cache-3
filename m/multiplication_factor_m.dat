5000|$|An {{avalanche}} photodiode (APD) {{is a highly}} sensitive semiconductor electronic device that exploits the photoelectric effect to convert light to electricity. APDs {{can be thought of}} as photodetectors that provide a built-in first stage of gain through avalanche multiplication. From a functional standpoint, they can be regarded as the semiconductor analog to photomultipliers. By applying a high reverse bias voltage (typically 100-200 V in silicon), APDs show an internal current gain effect (around 100) due to impact ionization (avalanche effect). However, some silicon APDs employ alternative doping and beveling techniques compared to traditional APDs that allow greater voltage to be applied (> 1500 V) before breakdown is reached and hence a greater operating gain (> 1000). In general, the higher the reverse voltage, the higher the gain.

5000|$|High-velocity {{electrons}} often {{collide with}} neutral atoms inelastically, sometimes ionizing them. In a chain-reaction — or an 'electron avalanche' — additional electrons recently {{separated from their}} positive ions by the strong potential gradient, cause a large cloud of electrons and positive ions to be momentarily generated by just a single initial electron. However, free electrons are easily captured by neutral oxygen or water vapor molecules (so-called electronegative gases), forming negative ions. In air at STP, free electrons exist for only about 11 nanoseconds before being captured. Captured electrons are effectively removed from play — {{they can no longer}} contribute to the avalanche process. If electrons are being created at a rate greater than they are being lost to capture, their number rapidly multiplies, a process characterized by exponential growth. The degree of multiplication that this process can provide is huge, up to several million-fold depending on the situation. The <b>multiplication</b> <b>factor</b> <b>M</b> is given by ...|$|E

In this work, data on the positive temperature dependence of the electron impact ionization coefficient n in In 0 : 53 Ga 0 : 47 As at medium-low electric fields are reported for the first time. The increase of n with temperature is opposite to the behavior normally observed in most semiconductors.

In addition to fundamental facts in pn-junction theory, the book covers mainly the important processes of power structures. It describes the emitter efficiency and function of microleaks (shunts). the p +p and n + n junctions, and in particular the recent theory of the pin, pvn and p 1 tn junctions, whose role appears to be decisive for the forward mode not only of diode structures but also of more complex ones.

40|$|Absract Aim - The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{establish}} the correlation between length of ulna with height of a person in various age groups and in both sexes. The study also intended to compare the two basic parameters used globally for such correlations, namely <b>multiplication</b> <b>factor</b> (<b>M.</b> F.) and regression equation; and try to comment on the efficacy of one formula over the other. Introduction- Height of an individual has evoked great interest since ancient time. The subject as a whole has been dealt with in different ways to predict the human stature. In ancient times, physicians & surgeons like Charak & Sushruta 1 were well acquainted with the relation of different parts of body with height. According to Charak, the height of an average man should be 84 -anguls, thigh- 21 anguls, forearm - 15 anguls & arm- 16 anguls. Dwarfism and gigantism, both resulting from hormonal dysfunction, are examples of variations in normal body height. Method & material - In the present study 504 individuals were studied. Study ranged across the age groups from 8 years to 22 years. Equal participation of males and females was ensured. Thus, 252 males (50 %) and 252 females (50 %) were included in the study. Observation – On an average the M. F. for male is between 6. 05 – 6. 76 for right ulna and 6. 08 - 6. 79 for left ulna. Discussion- It was observed that height estimation using M. F. is much simpler, easy and less time consuming; yet enough efficient; as compared to using regression equation.   Coclusions- 1 -M. F. is more applicable in medico-legal cases where one may be confronted with a single or fragmented bone, and person’s height needs to be ascertained. 2 - Regression equation is applicable in sample study of large population.   Key words: ulna, multiplication factor, regression equation</p...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{communications}} {{is expanding}} into new {{applications such as}} infrared wireless communications; therefore, designing high performance circuits has gained considerable importance. In this dissertation a wide dynamic-range variable-gain transimpedance amplifier (TIA) is introduced. It adopts a regulated cascode (RGC) amplifier and an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) as the feed forward gain element to control gain and improve the overload of the optical receiver. A fully-differential variable-gain TIA in a 0. 35 ?m CMOS technology is realized. It provides a bit error rate (BER) less than 10 - 12 for an input current from 6 ?A- 3 mA at 3. 3 V power supply. For the transimpedance gain variation, from 0. 1 k?? to 3 k??, - 3 dB bandwidth is higher than 1. 7 GHz for a 0. 6 pF photodiode capacitance. The power dissipations for the highest and the lowest gains are 8. 2 mW and 24. 9 mW respectively. A new technique for designing uniform multistage amplifiers (MA) for high frequency applications is introduced. The proposed method uses the multi-peak bandwidth enhancement technique while it employs identical, simple and inductorless stages. It has several advantages, such as tunability of bandwidth and decreased sensitivity of amplifier stages, to process variations. While all stages of the proposed MA topology are identical, the gain-bandwidth product can be extended several times. Two six-stage amplifiers in a TSMC 0. 35 ?m CMOS process were designed using the proposed topology. Measurements show that the gain can be varied for the first one between 16 dB and 44 dB within the 0. 7 - 3. 2 GHz bandwidth and for the second one between 13 dB and 44 dB within a 1. 9 - 3. 7 GHz bandwidth with less than 5. 2 nV/?Hz noise. Although the second amplifier has a higher gain bandwidth product, it consumes more power and occupies a wider area. A technique for capacitance multiplication is utilized to design a tunable loop filter. Current and voltage mode techniques are combined to increase the <b>multiplication</b> <b>factor</b> (<b>M).</b> At a high input dynamic range, M is adjustable and the capacitance multiplier performs linearly at high frequencies. Drain-source voltages of paired transistors are equalized to improve matching in the current mirrors. Measurement of a prototype loop filter IC in a 0. 5 ?m CMOS technology shows 50 ?A current consumption for M= 50. Where 80 pF capacitance is employed, the capacitance multiplier realizes an effective capacitance varying from 1. 22 nF up to 8. 5 nF...|$|E
