40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were {{to determine the effects of}} drying and wetting (DW) cycles on soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralisation and on the priming effect (PE) induced by the addition of 13 C-labelled wheat straw to long-term no-tillage (NT) and conventional-tillage (CT) soils. We observed that the SOC <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> in rewetted soils was greater than that in soils that were kept at constant water content. The proportion of CO 2 derived from the straw declined dramatically during the first 10 days. The priming direction was first positive, and then became slightly negative. The PE was higher under DW cycles than under constant water content. There was no significant effect of the tillage system on the SOC <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> or PE. The data indicate that the DW cycles had a significant effect on the SOC <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> and on the PE, demonstrating a positive combined effect between wheat straw and moisture fluctuations.

40|$|The {{formulation}} of a correct N fertilisation advice, besides a measurement of N-min {{at the start}} of the growing period, mainly depends on the possibility to predict the N mineralisation out of soil organic matter. This study aimed to model the N mineralisation of greenhouse soils, using both easily available and easily measurable parameters. Two laboratory incubation experiments were set up. The first incubation experiment allowed to deduct a zero-order model, N-t = kt, in which N-t = N mineralised [kg N ha(- 1) ], k = N <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> constant [kg N ha(- 1) day(- 1) ] and t = time [days], whereas the temperature dependence of the N <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> constant was deduced out of the second incubation experiment. The N <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> constant further depends on the N mineralisation potential of the soil and on the 'soil's age', i. e. being the time the soil has been glass-covered, eventually leading to the following simple N mineralisation model: N-t = (- 9. 965 + 0. 104 N-KCl + 0. 336 T + 0. 095 O) t, with N-KCl = N-min in a hot KCl-extract (100 degreesC) [kg N ha(- 1) ], T = temperature [degreesC] and O = soil's age [years]. Though the via the model calculated (k(mod)) and experimentally obtained (k(exp)) N <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> constants were closely related and a linear relationship was found k(mod) = 0. 872 k(exp) (R- 2 = 0. 719, alpha< 0. 01), further research is necessary to evaluate this model in-situ.

40|$|A soil {{community}} {{food web}} model {{was used to}} improve the understanding of what factors govern the mineralisation of nutrients and carbon and the decay of dead organic matter. The model derives the rates of C and N mineralisation by organisms by splitting their uptake rate of food resources into a rate at which faeces or prey remains are added to detritus, a rate at which elements are incorporated into biomass, and a rate at which elements are released by organisms as inorganic compounds. The functioning of soil organisms in the mineralisation of C and N was modelled in the soil horizon of a Scots pine forest. The organic horizon was divided into three distinct layers, representing successive stages of decay, i. e. litter, fragmented litter, and humus. Each of the layers had a different, quantitative, biota composition. For each layer the annual C and N <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates</b> were simulated and compared to observed C and N <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates</b> from organic matter in stratified litterbags. Simulated C and N mineralisation was relatively close to measured losses of C and N, but the fit was not perfect. Discrepancies between the observed and predicted <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates</b> are {{discussed in terms of}} variation in model parameter values of those organisms that showed the highest contribution to <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates.</b> The measured, and by the model predicted, significant decrease in <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates</b> down the profile was not explained by the biomass of the primary decomposers and only partly by the total food web biomass. Modelling results indicated that indirect effects of soil fauna, due to trophic interactions with their resources, are an important explanatory factor. In addition, the analyses suggest that community food web structure {{is an important factor in}} the regulation of nutrient mineralisation.

The soil organic carbon, water contents and <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates</b> of soil samples from the 0 – 5 cm layer were higher in the native forest than in the Douglas fir plantation. During incubation, a temperature-dependent shift in the δ 13 C of respired CO 2 was observed, suggesting that different carbon compounds were mineralised at different temperatures. The initial size of the WEOC pool was not affected by forest type. The WEOC pool size of samples from the native forest did not change consistently over time whereas it decreased significantly in samples from the Douglas plantation, irrespective of soil temperature. No clear changes in the δ 13 C values of the WEOC were observed, irrespective of soil origin.

Currently, mangrove forests receive increasing quantities of exogenous nutrients due to coastal development. The present paper quantifies the effects of nutrient loading on microbial growth <b>rates</b> and the <b>mineralisation</b> of soil organic carbon (SOC) in two mangrove soils contrasting in carbon content. An increase in SOC <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates</b> {{would lead to the}} loss of historically sequestered carbon and an enhanced CO 2 release from these mangrove soils. In an incubation experiment we enriched soils from Avicennia and Rhizophora mangrove forests bordering the Red Sea with different combinations of nitrogen, phosphorus and glucose to mimic the effects of wastewater influx. We measured microbial growth rates as well as carbon <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates</b> in the natural situation and after enrichment. The results show that microbial growth is energy limited in both soils, with nitrogen as a secondary limitation. Nitrogen amendment increased the rate at which labile organic carbon was decomposed, while it decreased SOC <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates.</b> Such an inhibitory effect on SOC mineralisation was not found for phosphorus enrichment.

30|$|MSH 1 beads {{were capable}} of {{initiating}} BAM mineralisation in all the tested bioaugmentation scenarios. Earlier work by Sørensen et al. (2007) shows that MSH 1 -free cells perform better at mineralising high concentrations of BAM than at a low concentration of BAM, when evaluated based on the percentage of added 14 C-BAM mineralised to 14 CO 2. This {{is in line with}} the present study’s findings, showing a general stimulation of the mineralisation extent when MSH 1 beads are used at a high concentration of BAM (5  mg L− 1) compared to the lower BAM concentration. The remaining part of the 14 C-labelled BAM not mineralised to 14 CO 2 is likely incorporated into biomass as described previously by Sørensen et al. (2007). It was interesting, however, that the initial <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> of BAM was similar or, more frequently, even higher when MSH 1 beads were challenged with high BAM concentrations in sand, buffer or soil. The initial <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> could be a crucial parameter in field remediation, as the flow rate of the passing water would determine the contact time between the degraders and BAM. Based on these evaluation criteria, further optimisation of the beads would appear relevant, especially when dealing with high BAM concentrations.|$|E

This study sought to understand how the decomposition of organic carbon varies within the soil pore network and to determine the relative importance of local environmental properties relative to biological properties as controlling factors. This was achieved by sterilising samples of soil and reinoculating them with axenic bacterial suspensions using the matric potential to target different locations in the pore network. Carbon mineralisation curves were described with two-compartment first-order models to distinguish CO 2 derived from the labile organic carbon released during sterilisation from CO 2 derived from organic C unaffected by sterilisation. The data indicated that the size of the labile pool of organic C, possibly of microbial origin, varied as a function of location in the pore network but that the organic carbon unaffected by sterilisation did not. The <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> of the labile C varied with the bacterial type inoculated, but the <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> of the organic C unaffected by sterilisation was insensitive to bacterial type.

Information on decomposition characteristics is needed for sound management of organic resources. Measurement of C and N <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates</b> and dry matter digestibility using current laboratory methods is both time-consuming and costly. This study tested near infrared (wavelengths from 1. 0 to 2. 5 µm) reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) for rapid prediction of C and N <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates</b> and in vitro dry matter digestibility for a diverse range of organic resources (n = 32).

40|$|The Earth’s surface {{contains}} of 71 % {{oceans and}} {{a large part of}} the global carbon cycle takes place in the oceans. In the aquatic environment, the sediment-water interface plays an important role for the mineralisation of organic material. One factor that can affect the mineralisation is resuspension. Resuspension cause mixing of surface sediments and bottom water and result in a redistribution of the sediment when it settles again. Resuspension also increases the transport of oxygen into the sediment, reduces the diffusive boundary layer surrounding particles, and enhance the nutrient uptake. Resuspension can be induced by both wave action and bottom currents and is a common physical process in both shallow coastal areas and in the deep ocean. Human impacts, such as dredging and trawling, can also cause resuspension. The effect of resuspension on mineralisation of organic material was studied in two experiments ex situ during December to April 2004 / 2005. The aim for Experiment 1 was to investigate how the intensity of the resuspension event affects the degradation rate. The aim for Experiment 2 was to investigate how different concentrations of resuspended sediment affect the degradation rate of organic matter. Sediment samples were collected in December and late March at a marine field station, Askö, Sweden. Sediment and bottom water were transferred to and incubated in sealed bottles. For Experiment 1, resuspension was created in bottles with a specially designed rotary table, creating different intensity of water movements. In Experiment 2, bottles with different concentrations of sediment were put on an ordinary rotary table. The mineralisation rates were in both experiments monitored by daily sampling of sediment-water slurry, and analysed for total inorganic carbon by a gas chromatography with a thermal detector, GC-TCD. Results from Experiment 1 did not show any clear patterns regarding inorganic carbon formation. Experiment 2 did show clear patterns for two of six replicates of mineralisation of organic material. For these replicates the <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> were low according to previous studies. However, the sediment concentration seems to not affect the <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate.</b> For both experiments, valuable information on how to better design experiments to investigate the importance of resuspension and the effect of mineralisation of organic material was yielded. Hence, further studies are needed to continue the investigation of the importance of resuspension for the <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> of organic material, and its impacts on the nutrient fluxes in the oceans...|$|E

To determine rates of both independent and preferential growth of ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes on organic and inorganic nitrogen, strains of Hebeloma were grown on nutrient agar media containing either NH 4 + or glutamic acid as the sole source of nitrogen, on both single medium and split plate Petri dishes. Growth rates on the split plate Petri dishes, where the fungi had access to both nitrogen sources, were generally greater than on the single medium dishes. Growth on glutamic acid was at least equal to, and usually greater than, that on NH 4 +. In some cases growth on NH 4 + alone appeared severely inhibited, a condition that was partially alleviated by access to glutamic acid on the split plates Petri dishes. This highlights a potential pitfall of single nitrogen source growth studies. The greater growth of most strains on glutamic acid suggests an adaptation to organic nitrogen utilisation in these strains.

40|$|Nitrogen {{fertilisation}} of {{arable land}} is strictly regulated in Belgium and other European countries by the nitrate directive. Farmers are challenged to adjust fertilisation rates {{in order to}} obtain good crop yields with a minimal release of nitrogen to the environment. Recommended nitrogen fertilisation rates are a. o. estimated from mineral N stocks in the soil and the expected N <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates</b> from soil organic matter, crop residues from the previous growing season, fertilising crops and planned organic fertilisations. These <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates</b> are often average values valid for average weather conditions. However, N <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates</b> and losses differ within and between the years since temperature and precipitation are important influencing factors. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} more accurate methods to estimate the nitrogen dynamics in the soil during the year. This will make it possible to balance nitrogen gift with crop needs and environmental objectives. Several models, predicting nitrogen dynamics in the soil, have been developed. Most of these models have the major disadvantage that they need detailed data which are often not available to the farmer. Therefore, the Louis Bolk Institute and Wageningen University, both located in the Netherlands, developed a practice oriented model called NDICEA. The most important advantages of NDICEA are that the required input parameters are easily available for the farmers and that it uses actual weather data. Several validation exercises in the Netherlands showed that this model predicts the mineral nitrogen dynamics on parcel level quite accurately during the year. The main objective of this study was to validate NDICEA for Belgian conditions. To investigate this some adjustments were made to the soil parameters and eight agricultural fields with different soil textures were monitored between August 2008 and March 2009. Comparing predictions of the adapted NDICEA model to mineral nitrogen measurements in the field revealed 84 % agreement for the 0 - 30 cm soil layer and 73 % for the 30 - 90 cm soil layer, accepting an error of 20 kg N/ha.

Thirty-two soils were collected from different climatic regions of southern Australia, varying in soil type, land use and agronomic management history.

C mineralisation (C min) model fitting was {{used to describe the}} amount of mineralisable C (Co 90 h) and the proportional <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> (k). Compared to constantly moist soils, 13 soils showed increases in both Co 90 h and k, indicating that DRW increased the amount of mineralisable C and the rate at which C was mineralised over the 90 -h period. In 17 soils, k was increased but not Co 90 h, showing an increase in C <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> but no change in the amount of mineralisable C. Two soils showed a reduction in k with no change in Co 90 h, possibly due to low C contents and small microbial biomass. Only one soil exhibited no change in either Co 90 h or k. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the magnitude of the increase in mineralisable C in response to the DRW event (∆Co 90 h[*]=[*]Co 90 h DRW[*]−[*]Co 90 h moist) was primarily explained by clay content (39 %); however, inclusion of nine soil physio-chemical properties explained more of the variation in ∆Co 90 h than any of the properties alone.

The influence of Pt deposits had on the photooxidation of these compounds was also studied. The photoactivity was found {{to depend on the}} nature of the parent substance and its level of hydroxylation. The presence of additional hydroxyl functional groups on butanedioic acid accelerated the diacid disappearance rate but decreased the overall <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate.</b> Accelerated diacid disappearance was attributed to increased parent organic adsorption via enhanced bonding between the extra OH groups and the TiO 2 surface. The slower mineralisation rates were ascribed to the additional hydroxyl groups altering or enhancing intermediate formation to produce more recalcitrant intermediates (e. g. ethanoic acid). In contrast, no consistent relationship was found between the additional hydroxyl group number and <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> for the alcohols. Hydroxyl addition to propanol was proposed to not significantly alter its adsorption mode on TiO 2 leading to similar disappearance rates for the alcohols. Differences in mineralisation rates were observed and thought to be dominated by differences in degradation rates of the generated intermediates. Pt/TiO 2 displayed a higher photoactivity than bare TiO 2 for both organic groups. Similar intermediates were formed irrespective of the Pt presence with its function as an electron sink primarily responsible for the enhancement. The Pt deposits also displayed a thermal (dark) catalytic effect for oxidising formic acid. Its dark catalysis was augmented by pre-irradiating the Pt/TiO 2 with UV light. Pre-irradiation was suspected to enhance electron accumulation in the Pt deposits, in turn facilitating oxygen dissociation which then enhanced formic acid oxidation. The pre- irradiation effect decayed with time but could be readily recovered by re- irradiating the Pt/TiO 2. This dark catalytic effect may further contribute to the overall Pt/TiO 2 photoactivity as formic acid is a commonly generated intermediate from photocatalysis...|$|E

Treatments were investigated at different amendment concentrations. From initial studies, the incapability of the endogenous soil microorganisms to mineralise diuron was confirmed. However, after the inorganic amendment was applied, {{with the aim}} of supplying essential nutrients for soil flora activation, a 5 % of diuron mineralisation was reached after 150 days, concluding that the soil has a potential capacity to mineralise the herbicide through biostimulation-assisted natural attenuation. Diuron mineralisation was improved using a HPBCD solution at a very low concentration of only 10 times the diuron equimolar concentration in soil. This molecule is able to form diuron inclusion complexes, which provokes an increasing in its hydrosolubility, and hence, in the amount of the herbicide in the soil solution. With this strategy, a higher amount of diuron molecules will be more bioaccesible for the soil microorganisms.

We performed a tracer experiment in which lyophilised 13 C-labelled cyanobacteria were added to sediments of two intertidal beaches (Tyskehytte and Breoyane) at Kongsfjorden (Spitsbergen) with contrasting sediment properties, benthic metabolic rates and meiobenthic communities. Tyskehytte was characterised by coarse sands on an exposed beach and Breoyane by medium sands on a relatively sheltered beach. Organic matter addition stimulated benthic metabolism in the coarser sediment but not in the finer one. Correspondingly, the added carbon was metabolised faster in the coarser sediment, respiration being its major short-term fate. Faster mineralisation of organic matter in coarser sediments was probably linked to a better availability to microbes and fauna in deeper sediment strata, resulting from a higher sediment porosity and a faster penetration of (labelled) organic matter to deeper sediment layers. Overall, organic matter <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates</b> at both beaches compared favourably with those in temperate sediments. All major meiofauna taxa incorporated the added carbon source on both beaches, but specific uptake was substantially higher in the coarser sediment than in the finer one. Oligochaetes accounted for the largest share of meiobenthic carbon uptake. Despite a very high specific uptake, meiofaunal consumption accounted for but a small portion (13 C-mineralisation. Thus our results do not support the hypothesis that meiofauna have a comparatively larger role in Arctic sandy beaches impoverished in macrofauna. However, more research including analyses on different spatial and temporal scales is needed before generalisations can be made...|$|R
40|$|Benthic {{activity}} was examined at three stations (18 m water depth) {{in the northwestern}} Adriatic Sea. Carbon <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates,</b> as based on sediment oxygen consumption rates, ranged from 54 to 89 g C m(- 2) y(- 1). The relatively high carbon <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates,</b> large macrofaunal biomass (9 to 16 g C m(- 2)) and macrofaunal production (11 to 19 g C m(- 2) y(- 1)) provide evidence of high organic-matter input and intense benthic-pelagic coupling. This is further supported by the high dominance of the suspension-feeding bivalve Corbula gibba, which accounts for 52 to 63 % of the total annual macrofaunal biomass production. Although the infaunal distribution of total macrofauna showed {{a sharp decline in}} densities and biomass with depth into the sediment, different patterns within the dominant taxa were observed. Whilst the bivalve Corbula gibba and the amphipod Ampelisca sp. were restricted to the surface layer, other species such as the dominant bivalve Mysella sp. and the gastropod Hyala sp. were not confined to a specific depth level and the majority of the populations occurred deeper than 5 cm into the sediment. Bioturbation, based on the occurrence of macrofauna, extended to at least 20 cm. Nematodes and foraminifera together formed 80 to 90 % of the meiofaunal community in the upper 5 cm of the sediment. Annual mean densities ranged from 3. 40 to 6. 07 x 10 (6) ind. m(- 2). Maximum abundance of meiofauna was not encountered at the station where maximum macrofaunal {{activity was}} recorded, and this could reflect the negative effect of biological interaction on meiofaunal densities in areas that have a high food supply.

40|$|The {{short-term}} decomposition {{dynamics of}} Ulva rigida C. Agardh by a natural bacterial consortium were {{studied in the}} laboratory using a 14 C radio-tracer technique. Following an initial rapid loss of approximately 15 % of the particulate organic carbon (POC) by leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), there was an exponential loss of POC and an accompanying increase in the labelling of the inorganic carbon (IC) pool. However, losses of labelled POC were significantly greater than the summed accumulation of radiolabel in the IC and DOC pools {{over the course of}} the experiments. We propose that this discrepancy may be due to the production of volatile organic compounds (VOC) during decomposition, which were stripped from the medium during the extraction of IC, by acidification and sparging with helium, but were not retained by the KOH traps for IC. The compatible solute dimethylsulphonioproprionate (DMSP) which is accumulated to high concentrations by Ulva spp. and is metabolised by bacteria to volatile dimethylsulphide (DMS) and potentially methane, could be one of the major sources of VOCs during our incubations. Modelled decomposition rates based on the loss of label from the particulate fraction were high, with calculated half times of 8. 1 and 7. 6 days. However, these rates greatly overestimate true <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates,</b> since only approximately 50 % of the label lost from the POC pool was recovered as IC. Overall these data indicate that previously determined decomposition rates based on loss of dry weight of macroagal biomasses would also greatly overestimate carbon <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates</b> and hence the oxygen demand for this mineralisation. This aspect may be particularly important for environmental management or modelling of bloom impacted environments, since the most severe impacts of macroalgal blooms are mediated by the hypoxic or anoxic conditions induced when the blooms collapse and hence are strictly related to the oxygen demand for mineralisation of the macroalgal biomasses...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{empirical}} model {{was developed for}} estimation of net mineralisation of pig and cattle slurry nitrogen (N) in arable soils under cool and moist climate conditions during the initial 5 years after spring application. The model {{is based on a}} Danish 3 -year field experiment with measurements of N uptake in spring barley and ryegrass catch crops, supplemented with data from the literature on the temporal release of organic residues in soil. The model estimates a faster <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> for organic N in pig slurry compared with cattle slurry, and the description includes an initial N immobilisation phase for both manure types. The model estimates a cumulated net mineralisation of 71 % and 51 % of organic N in pig and cattle slurry respectively after 5 years. These estimates are in accordance with some other mineralisation studies and studies of the effects of manure residual N in other North European countries...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{composition}} and properties of a biomixture {{used in a}} biobed are decisive for pesticide sorption and degradation. This study was performed to investigate the capability of compost-based substrates in mixtures with citrus peel and vine branch straw and peat-based substrates in mixtures with soil and vine branch straw at different levels in order to degrade isoproturon and bentazone. RESULTS: Dissipation and mineralisation rates of both pesticides were determined, and metabolic activity was followed as respiration. Compost-based substrates showed faster pesticide dissipation {{in the presence of}} lignocellulosic materials, as in garden compost and vine branch straw. The increasing content of vine branch straw in peat-based substrates does not seem to affect dissipation of the parent compounds. Low <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> was observed in all treatments. CONCLUSION: Higher pesticide degradation was observed in the lignocellulosic substrates, probably because of the development of lignin-degrading microorganisms which have shown to be robust and are able to degrade recalcitrant pesticides...|$|E
40|$|The aim {{of organic}} {{agriculture}} {{is to produce}} food of high nutritional quality in sufficient quantity. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of organic and conventional growing systems on (i) total amounts and supply of N taken up or applied to plants during a five year crop cycle period and (ii) crops total dry matter (DM) yield obtained during same period. The total DM yields from the organic treatments were 25 – 33 % smaller than from the conventional treatments. The ratio of N output/N input was significantly the smallest in the organic treatment with cattle manure, where only 37 % of all supplied N was used by plants during the crop cycle period. The organic fertiliser with faster <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rate</b> and splitting the application of organic N during crop cycle period would be more appropriate to supply sufficient quantities of N during rapid plant growth and to obtain higher crop yields in organic farming systems. ...|$|E

PM showed a significant negative priming effect over the incubation period. These results have implications for production agriculture in temperate regions where application and incorporation of bio-resources traditionally occurs in autumn and spring when soil and air temperatures are relatively low.

40|$|In the {{application}} of biosolids to land for agricultural purposes, the supply of plant-available nitrogen (PAN) should match the crop requirements. This ensures that the crop yield is maximised while minimising the environmental risk from over-application. In Victoria, the amount to be applied is usually calculated according to the State EPA guidelines using the nitrogen limited biosolids application rates (NLBAR). These guidelines specify the <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates</b> {{to be used in}} the NLBAR calculation for different types of biosolids. However, these rates have not been validated for Victorian soils and agricultural production systems. To test the veracity of these rates, this study quantified the amount of PAN for two different biosolids (anaerobically digested biosolids, ANDB; and aerobically digested biosolids, ADB) added to two types of soils, a sandy loam at Lara and a clay loam at the Melton Recycled Water Plant, Surbiton Park, Melton. The PAN was calculated by determining the N fertiliser equivalence of the biosolids. To achieve this, two field calibration plots were prepared, one for the biosolids and one for urea as the N fertiliser. Biosolids were applied based on total N at six rates (0, 68, 136, 204, 340 and 510 kg N ha– 1); urea was applied at six rates (0, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 280 kg N ha– 1). Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) was planted 1 day after {{the application}} of biosolids and harvested after 120 days. The calculated amount of mineralisable organic N in ANDB was estimated to be 41 % and 39 % when applied to the clay loam and sandy loam soils, respectively; for ADB, it was 12 % and 9 %, respectively. These values indicate that the organic N <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates</b> provided in the EPA Victoria guidelines (15 % for ANDB and 25 % for ADB) might not always be applicable. Also of note is that the values obtained for the each of the biosolids appear to be independent of the soil type...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} oxygen on the {{degradation}} of sedimentary organic matter has been determined for 6 subtidal stations and 3 intertidal stations in the North Sea area. The stations were selected to cover a range of organic matter lability and sediment texture (and hence concentrations of organic matter). Slurry incubations revealed that at low <b>mineralisation</b> <b>rates,</b> aerobic <b>mineralisation</b> is significantly faster than anaerobic mineralisation, irrespective of the degree of lability of organic matter. A complementary incubation experiment with sediment rich in organic carbon mixed with varying proportions of organically poor sediments confirmed the enhanced aerobic mineralisation at low mineralisation levels. It is proposed that oxygen-enhanced degradation occurs at low mineralisation levels at which bacterial biomass production becomes limiting.
