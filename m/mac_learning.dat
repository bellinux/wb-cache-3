40|$|This paper {{presents}} an end-to-end architecture, called VSITE, for seamless integration of cloud resources into an enterprise’s intranet at layer 2. VSITE allows a cloud provider {{to carve out}} its resources to serve multiple enterprises simultaneously while maintaining isolation and security. Resources (allocated to an enterprise) in the cloud provider appears “internal ” to the enterprise. VSITE achieves this abstraction {{through the use of}} VPN technologies, the assignment of different VLANs to different enterprises, and the encoding of enterprise IDs in MAC addresses. Unlike traditional layer 2 VPN technology such as VPLS, VSITE suppresses layer 2 <b>MAC</b> <b>learning</b> related broadcast traffic. VSITE makes use of location IP (represents location area) for scalable migration support. The MAC or IP address of a VM is not visible in data center core. VSITE has built in security mechanisms to prevent enterprises from attacking one another. Thus, VSITE is scalable, secure and efficient, and it facilitates common data center operation such as VM migration. Because VSITE extends enterprise network at layer 2, this offers transparency to most existing applications and {{presents an}} easy migration path for an enterprise to leverage cloud computing resources. 1...|$|E

40|$|A Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) {{is used to}} {{interconnect}} systems across a wide-area or metropolitan-area network, making it appear that {{they are on a}} private LAN. The systems that are interconnected may themselves be LAN switches. If, however, they are IP hosts or IP routers, certain simplifications to the operation of the VPLS are possible. We call this simplified type of VPLS an "IP-only LAN Service " (IPLS). In an IPLS, as in a VPLS, LAN interfaces are run in promiscuous mode, and frames are forwarded based on their destination Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. However, the maintenance of the MAC forwarding tables is done via signaling, rather than via the <b>MAC</b> address <b>learning</b> procedures specified in the IEEE’s "Media Access Control (MAC) Bridges". This document specifies the protocol extensions and procedures for support of the IPLS service.
