40|$|Diploid {{cells of}} the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae become {{committed}} to recombination at meiotic levels without becoming committed to the <b>meiotic</b> <b>disjunction</b> of chromosomes. These two events of the meiotic process can be separated by removing cells from a meiosis-inducing medium and returning them to a medium that promotes vegetative cell division. Cells removed at an appropriate time remain diploid, revert to mitosis, and display recombination with meiotic-like frequencies. Those removed after this time {{are committed to the}} completion of meiosis. Diploids of three conditional sporulation-deficient mutants (spo 1 - 1, spo 2 - 1, and spo 3 - 1) have been examined for recombination at restrictive temperatures. All exhibit commitment to recombination without commitment to <b>meiotic</b> <b>disjunction</b> as in the wild type. Cells of spo 1 - 1 /spo 1 - 1 do not replicate the spindle pole body for meiosis I; thus, recombination ability can be acquired by cells that do not proceed beyond this cytological stage...|$|E

The patient {{had a number}} of clinical signs of Turner's syndrome and her karyotype was 45,X,t(1; 2) (q 32;q 2) mat. Though it is speculated that the altered structure of a chromosome may influence <b>meiotic</b> <b>disjunction</b> of a non-homologous chromosome, our case suggests that there may be no relationship between the two chromosomal abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|Errors in meiotic {{recombination}} and its sequelae {{are one of}} {{the fundamental}} causes of newborn morbidity and mortality and results in a significant burden on public health. Current dogma regarding mechanisms of human meiosis states that recombination must occur in order for chromosomes to segregate properly. Recently, investigators have reported a positive correlation between reduced or absent recombination on chromosome 21 and a reduced genome-wide recombination rate. Although recombination rates vary among individuals, successful disjunction is not inextricably tied to recombination rate, and successful <b>meiotic</b> <b>disjunction</b> can occur in the absence of recombination. In addition to individual variation, recombination rates vary between genders and among different species. To better explore relationships between nondisjunction, disjunction and recombination, studies of an animal model with inherently lower genome-wide rates of recombination are useful. This project assesses the role of meiotic recombination in disjunction and nondisjunction based on studies of humans and Monodelphis domestica. Understanding the mechanisms that influence correct chromosomal segregation during meiosis could lead to methods of prophylaxis that could reduce the occurrence of such errors, and subsequently reduce newborn morbidity and mortality...|$|E
40|$|In Caenorhabditis elegans, {{exogenous}} dsRNA can elicit systemic RNAi, {{a process}} that requires the function of many genes. Considering that the activities {{of many of these}} genes are also required for normal development, it is surprising that exposure to high concentrations of dsRNA does not elicit adverse consequences to animals. Here, we report inducible phenotypes in attenuated C. elegans strains reared in environments that include nonspecific dsRNA and elevated temperature. Under these conditions, chromosome integrity is compromised in RNAi-defective strains harboring mutations in rsd- 2 or rsd- 6. Specifically, rsd- 2 mutants display defects in transposon silencing, while <b>meiotic</b> chromosome <b>disjunction</b> is affected in rsd- 6 mutants. RSD- 2 proteins localize to multiple cellular compartments, including the nucleolus and cytoplasmic compartments that, in part, are congruent with calreticulin and HAF- 6. We considered that the RNAi defects in rsd- 2 mutants might have relevance to membrane-associated functions; however, endomembrane compartmentalization and endocytosis/exocytosis markers in rsd- 2 and rsd- 6 mutants appear normal. The mutants also possess environmentally sensitive defects in cell-autonomous RNAi elicited from transgene-delivered dsRNAs. Thus, the ultimate functions of rsd- 2 and rsd- 6 in systemic RNAi are remarkably complex and environmentally responsive...|$|R
40|$|We {{explored}} {{the behavior of}} meiotic chromosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by examining the effects of chromosomal rearrangements on recombination and disjunction. Chromosome III derivatives in which the entire left arm or the entire right arm was deleted (telocentric) segregated with fidelity from a normal chromosome III. Recombination between either of these two deletion chromosomes and the intact chromosome also appeared normal. In a strain containing a right arm telocentric, a left arm telocentric and one normal chromosome both telocentrics disjoined from the normal chromosome. Homology on one arm was sufficient for proper recombination and segregation of these chromosomes. In strains containing two normal chromosomes and one telocentric chromosome the two normal chromosomes preferentially disjoined. In a few cases however, the two normal chromosomes cosegregated. Recombination between the two normal chromosomes or between one normal chromosome and the deletion chromosome increased the probability that they would disjoin, although cosegregation of recombinants was observed. A chromosome III derivative which contained a large centromeric deletion and an insertion of the centromere from chromosome V into a nonhomologous position segregated with fidelity from a normal chromosome III. These studies demonstrate {{that it is not}} pairing of the centromeres, but pairing and recombination along the arms of the homologs that directs <b>meiotic</b> chromosome <b>disjunction...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} a female-specific <b>meiotic</b> mutation, altered <b>disjunction</b> (ald: 361), are described. Although ald females show normal levels of meiotic exchange, sex- and 4 th-chromosome {{nondisjunction}} occurs at an elevated level. A {{large proportion of the}} nondisjunction events is the result of nonhomologous disjunction of the sex and 4 th chromosomes. These nonhomologous disjunction events, and probably all nondisjunction events occurring in ald females, are the result of two anomalies in chromosome behavior: (1) X chromosomes derived from exchange tetrads undergo nonhomologous disjunction and (2) the 4 th chromosomes nonhomologously disjoin from larger chromosomes. There is at best a marginal effect of ald on the meiotic behavior of chromosomes 2 or 3. The results suggest that the ald+ gene product acts to prevent the participation of exchange X chromosomes and all 4 th chromosomes in nonhomologous disjunction events. The possible role of ald+ in current models of the disjunction process is considered...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the meiotic recombination characteristics of artificial chromosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our experiments were carried out using minichromosome derivatives of yeast chromosome III and yeast artificial chromosomes composed primarily of bacteriophage λ DNA. Tetrad analysis revealed that the artificial chromosomes exhibit very low levels of meiotic recombination. However, when a 12. 5 -kbp fragment from yeast chromosome VIII was inserted into the right arm of the artificial chromosome, recombination within that arm mimicked the recombination characteristics of the fragment in its natural context including the ability of crossovers to ensure <b>meiotic</b> <b>disjunction.</b> Both crossing over and gene conversion (within the ARG 4 gene contained within the fragment) were measured in the experiments. Similarly, a 55 -kbp region from chromosome III carried on a minichromosome showed crossover behavior indistinguishable from that seen when it is carried on chromosome III. We discuss the notion that, in yeast, meiotic recombination behavior is determined locally by small chromosomal regions that function free {{of the influence of}} the chromosome as a whole...|$|E
40|$|Oenothera villaricae Dietrich and Oe. picensis Dietrich, {{complete}} translocation heterozygotes, {{are fully}} interfertile, {{giving rise to}} six discrete classes of true­ breeding hybrids from a reciprocal cross. Associated with each parent and hybrid is a characteristic ab 01 tive non­ staining pollen fraction easily distinguished from fully developed pollen under the light microscope. Pollen abortion {{has been associated with}} translocation rings in other angiosperm species, and may characterize such sys­ tems. The abortive pollen fraction is significantly differ­ ent between reciprocal Oenothera hybrids, however (P 3 ̆c 0. 001), indicative of partial cytoplasmic control. Pol­ len abortion is most severe in the F 1 hybrid generation, and ameliorates with successive generations of hybrid self-fertilization. Three-way analysis of variance shows significant effects on pollen stainability (a measure of the non-abortive fraction) for nucleus, cytoplasm and selfed hybrid generation, individually or in combinations. This result suggests a combined nucleocytoplasmic basis for the pollen abortion. Correlated with the observation of in­ creased pollen abortion in Oenothera hybrids are meiotic findings of broken chromosome rings (chains, univa­ lents), asymmetric anaphase chromosome distributions and trinucleate tetrads. To test the hypothesis that such anomalous meiotic events {{play a role in the}} mechanism of pollen abortion, <b>meiotic</b> <b>disjunction</b> frequency was de­ termined for each parent, F 1 and F 9 selfed hybrid acces­ sions. Three-way analysis of variance shows levels of sig­ nificance comparable to those noted for pollen stainabili­ ty (...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that cdc 13 causes meiotic arrest of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{following}} DNA replication by a RAD 9 -dependent mechanism. In the present work, we have further investigated the implicit effects of chromosomal lesions on progression through meiosis by exposing yeast cells to X-irradiation at various times during sporulation. We find that exposure of RAD 9 cells to X-irradiation early in meiosis prevents sporulation, arresting the cells at a stage prior to premeiotic DNA replication. rad 9 meiotic cells are much less responsive to X-irradiation damage, completing sporulation after treatment with doses sufficient to cause arrest of RAD 9 strains. These findings thereby reveal a RAD 9 -dependent checkpoint function in meiosis that is distinct from the G(2) arrest previously shown to result from cdc 13 dysfunction. Analysis of the spores that continued to be produced by either RAD 9 or rad 9 cultures that were X-irradiated in later stages of sporulation revealed most spores to be viable, even after exposure to radiation doses sufficient to kill most vegetative cells. This finding demonstrates that the lesions induced by X-irradiation at later times fail to trigger the checkpoint function revealed by cdc 13 arrest and suggests that the lesions {{may be subject to}} repair by serving as intermediates in the recombination process. Strains mutant for chromosomal synapsis and recombination, and therefore defective in <b>meiotic</b> <b>disjunction,</b> were tested for evidence that X-ray-induced lesions might alleviate inviability by promoting recombination. Enhancement of spore viability when spo 11 (but not hop 1) diploids were X-irradiated during meiosis indicates that induced lesions may partially substitute for SPO 11 -dependent functions that are required for the initiation of recombination...|$|E
40|$|We have {{employed}} {{a system that}} utilizes homologous pairs of human DNA-derived yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) as marker chromosomes to assess the specific role (s) of conserved centromere DNA elements (CDEI, CDEII and CDEIII) in <b>meiotic</b> chromosome <b>disjunction</b> fidelity. Thirteen different centromere (CEN) mutations were tested for their effects on meiotic centromere function. YACs containing a wild-type CEN DNA sequence segregate with high fidelity in meiosis I (99 % normal segregation) and in meiosis II (96 % normal segregation). YACs containing a 31 -bp deletion mutation in centromere DNA element II (CDEIIδ 31) in either a heterocentric (mutant/wild type), homocentric (mutant/mutant) or monosomic (mutant/ [...] ) YAC pair configuration exhibited high levels (16 - 28 %) of precocious sister-chromatid segregation (PSS) and increased levels (1 - 6 %) of nondisjunction meiosis I (NDI). YACs containing this mutation also exhibit high levels (21 %) of meiosis II nondisjunction. Interestingly, significant alterations in homolog recombination frequency were observed in the exceptional PSS class of tetrads, suggesting unusual interactions between prematurely separated sister chromatids and their homologous nonsister chromatids. We also have assessed the meiotic segregation effects of rare gene conversion events occurring at sites located immediately adjacent to or distantly from the centromere region. Proximal gene conversion events were associated with extremely high levels (60 %) of meiosis I segregation errors (including both PSS and NDI), whereas distal events had no apparent effect. Taken together, our results indicate a critical role for CDEII in meiosis and underscore the importance of maintaining sister-chromatid cohesion for proper recombination in meiotic prophase and for proper disjunction in meiosis I...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to isolate structural chromosome mutations causing "semi"-sterility which can be used for genetic control of the onion fly Hylemya antiqua (Meigen). For the induction, X-rays or fast neutrons were applied in different doses on males and females. "Semi"-sterile families were screened cytologically for translocations and inversions. It appeared that high doses 0. 5 krad of X-rays) tended to yield complex rearrangements which present difficulties in practical programs, in addition to the useful less complicated rearrangements. They also produce more genetic background damage than lower doses (0 - 5 krad), which still yield acceptable numbers of uncomplicated rearrangements and therefore are advised for a genetic control program. Because of strongly reduced fecundity of irradiated females these are less suitable for induction of rearrangements than males, although older females because of higher fecundity give better results than young females. Fast neutrons on young males were useful and a low dose of 0. 25 krad appeared {{to be as good as}} 1. 0 krad. Seventeen different translocations and two pericentric inversions were observed. Most "breakpoints" are located on the longer chromosome arms. Inversion heterozygous males were as fertile as the control which confirms their achiasmate meiosis. Eight translocation stocks were sibcrossed. In five of these, translocation homozygotes were found as larvae and in three out of these five even as adults. The occurrence of duplication/deficiency (from adjacent I orientation) larvae in the five stocks mentioned was remarkable. From experiments with an X-linked translocation it was concluded that the acrocentric chromosomes are the sex-chromosomes. The alternate and adjacent I orientation frequencies in translocation heterozygotes (X-linked) were shown to be equal in each sex, while no adjacent II was found. In this translocation <b>meiotic</b> numerical non- <b>disjunction</b> occurred in 18. 7 % of the tranlocation heterozygous females but in 2. 0 % of the males. This difference is probably a consequence of the difference in meiotic behaviour between the sexes. A good relationship was found between the degree of chromosomal unbalance and the frequency of late embryonic lethals (brown eggs) which was used as a graduator in the selection for "semi"-sterility. Adult fertile translocation trisomics and adult sterile tertiary trisomics were obtained (both sexes) after <b>meiotic</b> numerical non- <b>disjunction.</b> In translocation trisomic males the X-, Y- and translocated (extra) X-chromosome were shown to disjoin at random. In females the two normal X-chromosomes almost (95 %) preferentially disjoin, while the translocated X-chromosome goes to either one of the poles. Primary trisomic males (XXY) and females (XXX) were obtained from testcrossed translocation trisomic parents. XXY males produced four types of gametes XY, X, Y and XX in equal numbers. XXX females only gave XX and X gametes in an equal number. Succesfull attempts to obtain homozygotes for this X-linked translocation are reported. The theoretical background of genetic insect control is discussed...|$|R
40|$|We have {{followed}} sex and second chromosome disjunction, {{and the effects}} of these chromosomes on sperm function, in four genotypes: wild-type males, males deficient for the Y-linked crystal locus, males with an X chromosome heterochromatic deficiency that deletes all X–Y pairing sites, and males with both deficiencies. Both mutant situations provoke chromosome misbehavior, but the disjunctional defects are quite different. Deficiency of the X heterochromatin, consonant with the lack of pairing sites, mostly disrupts X–Y disjunction with a decidedly second-level effect on major autosome behavior. Deleting crystal, consonant with the cytological picture of postpairing chromatin-condensation problems, disrupts sex and autosome disjunction equally. Even when the mutant-induced nondisjunction has very different mechanics, however, and even more importantly, even in the wild type, there is strong, and similar, meiotic drive. The presence of <b>meiotic</b> drive when <b>disjunction</b> is disrupted by distinctly different mechanisms supports the notion that drive is a normal cellular response to meiotic problems rather than a direct effect of particular mutants. Most surprisingly, in both wild-type and crystal-deficient males the Y chromosome moves to the opposite pole from a pair of nondisjoined second chromosomes nearly 100 % of the time. This nonhomologous interaction is, however, absent when the X heterochromatin is deleted. The nonhomologous disjunction of the sex and second chromosomes may be the genetic consequence of the chromosomal compartmentalization seen by deconvolution microscopy, and the absence of Y– 2 disjunction when the X heterochromatin is deleted suggests that XY pairing itself, or a previously unrecognized heterochromatic function, is prerequisite to this macrostructural organization of the chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that translocations, and perhaps other chromosome rearrangements, disturb <b>meiotic</b> <b>disjunction</b> of uninvolved chromosome pairs and predispose to trisomic offspring. If so, then one would expect an excess of translocations not involving chromosome 21 among the parents of regular trisomic Down's syndrome patients. Such translocations have been reported, but mostly as anecdotal single case reports or very small series. In an attempt to collect a larger series, a collaborative study of regular Down's syndrome families was made in southern England. This was retrospective, and covered periods of 7 to 10 years since 1970. The number of regular trisomy families investigated was 1454. Only 945 of the 2908 parents were karyotyped, and 10 balanced reciprocal translocations not involving chromosome 21 were identified, together with one Robertsonian (13 q 14 q). Expressing these as percentages of the parents tested (945), prevalences are as follows: reciprocals 1. 06 %, Robertsonians 0. 11 %, and all translocations 1. 16 %. Expressed as percentages of the total parents (2908), tested and untested, the prevalences are 0. 34 %, 0. 03 %, and 0. 37 % respectively. The 'true' prevalences, that is what would have been found had all parents been tested, must lie between these two sets of figures. The prevalence of reciprocal translocations exceeds that found for consecutive banded newborn infants, which is 0. 16 %, and this excess may reflect a real interchromosomal effect. Robertsonian translocations in the banded newborn series are at a frequency of 0. 11 %, identical to that found in the tested parents of regular trisomics. Interpretation of these figures is critically dependent upon the real prevalence of translocations among the newborn, estimates of which increase as technical methods are improving...|$|E
40|$|Biochemical markers are {{reliable}} {{indicators of}} sperm maturity and function. The major hallmark among biochemical markers is the 70 kDa heat shock protein, the HspA 2. It {{proved to be}} very useful in assessment of sperm immaturity and fertilization potential. Expression of HspA 2 is developmentally regulated, having a characteristic dual wave expression pattern. The first peak is in the round spermatocytes, the second a major peak is expressed in the elongating spermatids. Concerning the function of HspA 2, {{it is part of}} the synaptonemal complex and supports the meiosis in round spermatocytes; abnormal expression therefore may cause meiosis defects, disomies. In the elongation phase HspA 2 as chaperone protein facilitates assembly, folding and transport of different proteins among them protamins, DNA repair enzymes and proteins necessary for membrane remodeling. The low expression of HspA 2 resulted in different forms of arrested nuclear and cytoplasmic maturities, like persistent histones, DNA chain brakes and surplus cytoplasm. Previous studies on HspA 2 theory found correlation between different attributes of cellular immaturity in the semen samples. Other researches studied relationship between meiotic defects and various cellular immaturity forms in semen samples, and there was also strong correlation between them. These studies validate the HspA 2 theory, but the intracellular relationship between the HspA 2 related defects remained unclear. My concern in this thesis was to find intracellular correlation between different HspA 2 related defects such as nuclear and cellular immaturity attributes and meiotic nondisjunction. To test supposed co-occurrence of abnormalities double probing technique of individual spermatozoa has been developed. In the first experiment by consecutive AB and FISH probing we found that arrested nucleoprotein replacement and <b>meiotic</b> non <b>disjunction</b> are related within individual spermatozoa. This study validates our hypothesis on the central role of HspA 2 in the spermatogenesis. In another study AB staining was combined with CK immunostaining, ISNT, and caspase- 3 immunocytochemistry. Data of this study proved that different attributes of arrested maturity in the nuclear and cellular compartment, persistent histones, surplus cytoplasm and DNA chain bakes are related in the same cell, moreover the degree of abnormalities were also conforming (kappa= 0. 8). The apoptotic activity was also related to immaturity. These facts support the theory that HspA 2 has central role in the spermatogenesis. However in low proportion there is heterogeneity in staining pattern. This is important for two reasons; first it proves that sperm after the defected maturation step may follow its changes in several pathways. Second the arrested spermiogenesis can not be examined correctly just by one biochemical probe only. In the third study detailed morphometrical evaluation of the sperm head and tail was carried out in order to find differences between native, non decondensed spermatozoa with haploid and disomic set. Meanwhile there was significant difference in morphometric parameters such as head area, head area and the short axis between haploid and aneuploid cells by objective morphometry, disomic sperm heads were larger, but the by evaluation of distribution data were inconsistent, there was also a substantial (70...|$|R
