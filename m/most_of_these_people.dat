5|$|At {{the end of}} 1941 and the {{beginning}} of 1942, approximately 7,000 Jewish women, children and old men were brought to the camp, along with a further 500 Jewish men and 292 Romani women and children. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were from the outlying Serbian towns, primarily Niš, Smederevo and Šabac. Women and children were placed in makeshift barracks that were barely heated, and whose windows were shattered due to German bombing raids carried out during the invasion of Yugoslavia. Originally constructed as fair pavilions, the largest of these barracks held up to 5,000 prisoners. Inmates suffered during numerous influenza epidemics, slept on wet straw or bare floorboards, and were provided with inadequate amounts of food. Starvation was widespread, and Jewish inmates appealed unsuccessfully to Serbian authorities for more food to be provided to the camp. Consequently, a high number of detainees, especially children, died in late 1941 and early 1942, with many inmates freezing to death in one of the coldest winters on record. The Romani inmates were kept in far more miserable conditions than their Jewish counterparts. They also slept on straw in an unheated hall, but were kept separate from non-Romani prisoners. The majority of Romani inmates were released after six weeks of detention. Most Jewish inmates remained detained, with the exception of ten Jewish women who were married to Christian men.|$|E

It also initiated a Canadian component of the Trade Union Educational League (TUEL) which quickly became an organic part of the labour movement with active groups in 16 of 60 labour councils and in mining and logging camps. By 1925 party membership stood at around 4,500 people, composed mainly of miners and lumber workers, and of railway, farm, and garment workers. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> came from immigrant communities like Finns and Ukrainians.|$|E
25|$|As {{the years}} passed, the Oregon Trail became a heavily used {{corridor}} from the Missouri River to the Columbia River. Offshoots {{of the trail}} continued to grow as gold and silver discoveries, farming, lumbering, ranching, and business opportunities resulted in much more traffic to many areas. Traffic became two-directional as towns were established along the trail. By 1870 {{the population in the}} states served by the Oregon Trail and its offshoots increased by about 350,000 over their 1860 census levels.

25|$|The {{first record}} of the Dunfermline lodge was {{established}} in 1716 with the signatures of 214 members. At this time the membership was composed {{of a majority of}} gardeners by trade, but also numerous artisans and two members of the local aristocracy. Rapidly, the membership grew and the social level rose—to the point that the professional gardeners no longer formed the majority of new members—but the recruitment remained local. In 1721, 101 new members of all social statuses were admitted into the lodge, from gardeners and butchers to the Duke of Atholl. The following years saw a fairly large number of aristocrats initiated in Free Gardening in the Dunfermline lodge, even while they remain {{on the edge of the}} Haddington lodge, which remains mainly active. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> possess famous gardens. Starting from 1736, the date of the creation of the (Masonic) Grand Lodge of Scotland, this tendency ceased and there were no more initiations of aristocrats in the Dunfermline lodge.|$|E

50|$|Several centuries {{after the}} end of the First Age, the Númenóreans began {{expanding}} their power back to the coasts of Middle-earth itself, establishing trading posts and forts from the Blue Mountains in the north to the Haven of Umbar in the south. There they came into contact with the languages of the local coastal peoples. It was soon realized that these languages were (mostly) closely related to the Taliska language which had stood at the basis of Adûnaic itself. As such the coastal peoples and Númenóreans themselves adopted each other's languages relatively quickly. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> were indeed <b>of</b> related kin to the Edain and would later form <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the population of Gondor and Arnor.|$|R

The Indian industrialist Vijay Mallya organised special flights, including a few chartered ones, to transport film actors, politicians and businessmen to Johannesburg; <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> supported India. Some South African airlines also extended their support to India. The air tickets from Mumbai to Johannesburg were completely sold out immediately after India entered the Super Sixes stage. Although most journalists and analysts favoured Australia, former Pakistan captain Imran Khan believed India were favourites. Former Australia cricketer Greg Chappell complimented Brett Lee: he said, except for Lee, no Australian bowler {{was a serious}} threat to the Indian batsmen, and also remarked that the [...] "duel" [...] between Lee and Tendulkar would be crucial.|$|E
500|$|A 2001 survey {{reported}} by Dr. Axel Hoffman showed that an Antoinist healer had received 216 patients {{over a period}} of twenty days, that the reasons to consultate were related to physical (47%), psychological (19%), sentimental (13%) and professional (13%) issues, and that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> also consulted a doctor. The Antoinist healing process does not include a doctrinal teaching nor a psychological manipulation. It does not necessarily imply the end of the problem or illness, and can be divided into three phases: the relief provided by the healer through listening and intercession with God, then acceptance of the problem which requires the recognition of one's responsibilities, and finally the inner peace that results. Whether immediate or gradual, healings are never considered as miracles in the religion because they are supposed to occur inevitably when all necessary conditions, including the faith of the patient, are met. Even after several consultations, the consultant does not necessarily become a follower. Several sociologists deemed the Antoinist healing as [...] "exorcist" [...] as well as [...] "adorcist".|$|E

50|$|As {{the empire}} grew older, new tribes arrived into Germania cisrhenana, and these regions started {{to become more}} independent. By {{the time of the}} {{collapse}} of the empire's central power in Gaul, there is little doubt about the fact that all or <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> were unified in their use of Germanic languages or dialects. The cisrhenane Germani eventually ceased to be restricted to a band of occupation near the border, and all Roman provinces west of the Rhine were eventually conquered by Germanic tribes, speaking Germanic languages: the Franks (Germania inferior and northern France), the Alemanni (Germania superior), the Burgundians (southeast France), the Visigoths (southwest France and Catalonia), and so on including even Germanic overlords as far away from the Rhine as Galicia, Andalucia, and Tunisia.|$|R

Afterwards, many of these people were driven from their natural territories, but most of the tribes of Maine continued, unchanged, until the American Revolution. Before this point, however, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were considered separate nations.

2500|$|As {{with other}} social movements, {{there is also}} {{conflict}} within and between LGBT movements, especially about strategies for change and debates over exactly who represents the constituency of these movements, and this also applies to changing education. There is debate over what extent lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersexed people, and others share common interests and a need to work together. [...] Leaders of the lesbian and gay movement of the 1970s, 80s and 90s often attempted to hide masculine lesbians, feminine gay men, transgender people, and bisexuals from the public eye, creating internal divisions within LGBT communities. Roffee and Waling (2016) discovered that LGBTIQ people experience microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours from other people within the LGBTIQ community. This is due to misconceptions and conflicting views as to what entails [...] "LGBTIQ". For example, transgender people found that {{other members of the}} community were not understanding to their own, individual, specific needs and would instead make ignorant assumptions, and this can cause health risks. [...] Additionally, bisexual people found that lesbian or gay people were not understanding or appreciative of the bisexual sexuality. Evidently, even though <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> would say that they stand for the same values as the majority of the community, there are still remaining inconsistencies even within the LGBTIQ community.|$|E

50|$|During the Postclassical Era, Africa {{was both}} {{culturally}} and politically {{affected by the}} introduction of Islam and the Arabic empires. This was especially true in the north, the Sudan region, and the east coast. However, this conversion was not complete nor uniform among different areas, and the low-level classes hardly changed their beliefs at all. Prior to the migration and conquest of Muslims into Africa, much of the continent was dominated by diverse societies of varying sizes and complexities. These were ruled by kings or councils of elders who would control their constituents in a variety <b>of</b> ways. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> practiced spiritual, animistic religions.
