50|$|A <b>media</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>address</b> (MAC address) of a {{computer}} is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications at the data link layer of a network segment. MAC addresses are used as a network address for most IEEE 802 network technologies, including Ethernet and Wi-Fi.

50|$|In IEEE 802 {{networks}} such as Ethernet, token ring, and IEEE 802.11, and in FDDI, each frame {{includes a}} destination <b>Media</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> <b>address</b> (MAC address). In non-promiscuous mode, when a NIC receives a frame, it normally drops it unless {{the frame is}} addressed to that NIC's MAC address or is a broadcast or multicast frame. In promiscuous mode, however, the NIC allows all frames through, thus allowing the computer to read frames intended for other machines or network devices.|$|E
50|$|A VNIC is a pseudo network {{interface}} that is configured {{on top of}} a system's physical network adapter, also called a {{network interface}} (NIC). A physical interface can have more than one VNIC. Each VNIC operates like and appears to the system as a physical NIC. The individual VNIC is assigned a <b>media</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>address</b> (MAC address), which can be configured to a value other than the default MAC address assigned to the physical NIC. You can use the resource control features of Crossbow to allocate separate bandwidths to the individual VNICs. Moreover, you can configure a virtual machine, such as an exclusive IP zone or xVM domain {{on top of a}} VNIC.|$|E
50|$|The term message {{integrity}} code (MIC) is frequently substituted for the term MAC, especially in communications, where the acronym MAC traditionally stands for <b>Media</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> <b>address.</b> However, some authors use MIC {{to refer to}} a message digest, which is different from a MAC -- a message digest does not use secret keys. This lack of security means that any message digest intended for use gauging {{message integrity}} should be encrypted or otherwise be protected against tampering. Message digest algorithms are created such that a given message will always produce the same message digest assuming the same algorithm is used to generate both. Conversely, MAC algorithms are designed to produce matching MACs only if the same message, secret key and initialization vector are input to the same algorithm. Message digests do not use secret keys and, when taken on their own, are therefore a much less reliable gauge of message integrity than MACs. Because MACs use secret keys, they do not necessarily need to be encrypted to provide the same level of assurance.|$|E

In his testimony, Brown {{claimed that the}} growth of technology {{and the ability to}} claim anonymity has [...] "enabled child pornography to become a worldwide epidemic" [...] and made it more difficult for law enforcement to identify and prosecute child predators. Brown further reasoned that an Internet Service Provider (ISP) could retain client records for a limited span of time, ranging from a couple hours, days, or weeks, and that a lack of uniformity across ISPs [...] "significantly hinders law enforcement's ability to identify predators when they come across child pornography." [...] He then provided an actual account of when his county received a cybertip from the NCMEC involving an individual who posted that they were exposing themselves to a toddler. The only information he claimed law enforcement possessed was the IP address that was accessing a YAHOO Chat room through an nTelos wireless connection. During the investigation, law enforcement discovered that the ISP only retained the <b>Media</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>address</b> and IP history for 30 days, a limit that foreclosed their opportunity to access investigative material.|$|E

In a similar way, the proposed paper, Enhanced Object Tracking Using Davinci Processors, will also possess major challenge for emerging computer vision technology. The Continuously Adaptive Mean Shift [CAMSHIFT] Algorithm used here {{is based on the}} Mean Shift Algorithm for object tracking for a perceptual user interface. The main aim of this proposal is to determine the effectiveness of the CAMSHIFT Algorithm as a general purpose object tracking approach in the case where a small portion of image is assumed as region of interest. Then the object within the corresponding region of interest is tracked using CAMSHIFT algorithm. The algorithm performs well mainly on moving objects in video sequences and it is robust to changes in shape of the moving object. The Digital Video Development Platform [DM 6437 EVM] is used to obtain the video from the camera and will use the Ethernet <b>media</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>address</b> and video processing back end drivers for the real time transmission of the video captured.

40|$|AbstractAirport {{security}} screening, and {{the amount}} of time it costs travelers, has been a persistent concern to travelers, airport authorities, and airlines – particularly in recent years where changes in perceived threats have resulted in changes in security procedures that have caused great uncertainty relating to security transit times. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the factors influencing travelers' security transit times, determinants of security transit times are studied by using anonymous Bluetooth <b>media</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>address</b> matching to determine the actual security travel times of individual passengers at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. These transit-time data are then analyzed using a random-parameters hazard-based duration model to statistically explore the factors that affect airport security transit times. The estimation results reveal, as expected, that a wide variety of factors affect security transit times including the number of enplaning seats (reflecting flight schedules), weather conditions, day of week, as well as obvious variables such as traveler volume and the number of open security lanes. The detailed statistical findings show that current security procedures are reactive instead of proactive, and that substantial reductions in security transit times could be attained by optimizing security operations using a statistical model such as the one estimated in this paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{switching}} function was primarily entrusted to Layer 2 of the OSI model, i. e. the Data Link Layer. A Layer 2 switch performs forwarding decisions {{by analyzing the}} MAC (<b>Media</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control)</b> <b>address</b> of the destination segment in the frame. The Layer 2 switch checks for the destination address and transmits the packet to the appropriate segment if the address is present in its table of known destinations. If the entry for that address is not present, the switch then forwards the packet to all segments except the one on which it came from. This is known as flooding. When it gets a reply from the destination segment, it learns {{the location of the}} new address and adds it to its table of known destinations. As number of users are increasing on the network, the speed and the bandwidth of the network is being stretched to its limits. Earlier, switching was primarily entrusted to Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model, but now there are switches that operate at Layer 3 (Network Layer), Layer 4 (Transport Layer) and Layer 5 (Session Layer) of the OSI model.

Unfortunately, some users of IoT systems that are controlled by a mobile application do not have a high level of data protection to respond in case the device is lost, stolen, or used by one of the owner’s friends or family members. The problem studied in this research is how to apply one of access control methods an IoT system whether they are stored locally on a sensor or on a cloud.

40|$|In various situations, {{there is}} a need to {{estimate}} the number of active Wi-Fi enabled devices, like smartphones, within a specific area. This thesis offers one possible approach to accomplish this task. It focuses on estimating the number of devices in a certain area based on monitoring and processing Wi-Fi metadata, which includes a received signal strength indicator. To accomplish this goal, four sensing devices are placed at the corners of a rectangular area. These sensing devices observe and record local data traffic, along with the received signal strength associated with each packet. For each sensing device, two types of frontends are considered, namely directional and isotropic antennas. Each sensing device retrieves the received signal strength indicators and the <b>media</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>addresses</b> from the 802. 11 frames packets transmitted by nearby active wireless devices. The estimator takes the received signal strength indicators as input and infers the number of active Wi-Fi devices inside the area of interest.

Overall performance is used to compare and contrast the systems implemented with directional antennas and isotropic antennas, respectively. Theoretical and experimental results both hint at performance improvements when using directional antennas, when compared to standard isotropic antennas...|$|R

Time stamping is one of the ways to prevent the information by keep tracking time creation of the document. Based on the existing research, there are several techniques that implemented time stamping method for a document. In this study, implementing time stamping method for medical record system is the main objective. The integrity of patient medical data is important and therefore the medical record need a mechanism that can verify the record from unauthorized manipulation. The components that included in this proposed time stamping method are MAC (<b>Media</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control)</b> <b>Address</b> and hash function (SHA 512). Besides that, this proposed method also provides a link between a record to another record. That link is produced by including hash value of previous record to the time stamp. This proposed method introduced several functionalities for the medical record. The first functionality is to trace creation time of each record, by recording of the time when the document was time-stamped. The second functionality is to trace who is the creator of the record. The third functionality is to trace which computing device that has been used to create the record by examining the MAC Address. And the last functionality is to prevent the possibility of unauthorized document was put between the documents that already stored in the database by implementing linking hash value. Thus by implement this proposed method, the sensitive information of medical record can be prevented from updated and manipulation by unauthorized people...|$|E

With the rapid development of new technological enhancements, {{there has been a}} shift in the way organizations and employees carry out their business. It is this rapid change from the traditional way of doing office work and/or business that has necessitated the adoption of new practices such as BYOD. To this effect then, corporates are faced with new security and privacy challenges in today’s mobile environment one among many being Identification, Authentication, Authorization and Access Control of the users. The research aimed to delve into the factors such as Mobile Device Security Models and Architectures, and current solutions that are being implemented when adopting BYOD whilst considering their strengths and weakness. This analysis of strengths and weakness is what showed that the current solutions are mainly device, data and/or application-centric and have not taken into consideration that illegitimate access to corporate systems can be made via the use of legitimate device and application by unauthorized users. The proposed device identity and user authentication management system is a strong hybrid of the device identity and user authentication solutions that sought to have an augmented solution there by having security in depth in the BYOD environment. The solution used the combination of the unique <b>Media</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> <b>address</b> and the device owners’ personal phone numbers which were concatenated for identification and authentication of the user device and its respective owner whereas an access control register was used for access authorization thereafter.

This new approach offers a number of advantages over more conventional methods, including lower costs of hardware and software, the volume of data that can be collected over time, and ease of implementation. A fundamental component that may affect the quantity and the quality of the travel time samples collected with a Bluetooth-based system is the antenna type utilized. Antenna characteristics such as polarization and gain must be matched to specific application environments to optimize the performance of a Bluetooth reader unit. However, experimental data that focuses on antenna characterization as it relates to the use of Bluetooth technology to assess the performance of transportation facilities is lacking. In this study, five different types of antennas were characterized to assess their suitability to support a Bluetooth-based travel time data collection system. The results indicate that vertically polarized antennas with gains between 9 dBi and 12 dBi are good candidates for travel time data collection. Also, different antenna types are better suited to different uses of the Bluetooth-based system. If the main focus is the collection of travel time data, then an antenna with a lower sampling rate may provide more accurate travel time samples...|$|R
