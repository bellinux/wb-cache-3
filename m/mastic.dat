25|$|Chewing gum in {{many forms}} has existed since the Neolithic period. 6,000-year-old chewing gum made from birch bark tar, with tooth imprints, {{has been found in}} Kierikki in Finland. The tar from which the gums were made is {{believed}} to have antiseptic properties and other medicinal benefits. It is chemically similar to petroleum tar and is in this way different from most other early gum. The Aztec, as well as the ancient Maya before them, used chicle, a natural tree gum, as a base for making a gum-like substance and to stick objects together in everyday use. Forms of chewing gums were also chewed in Ancient Greece. The Ancient Greeks chewed <b>mastic</b> gum, made from the resin of the <b>mastic</b> tree. <b>Mastic</b> gum, like birch bark tar, has antiseptic properties and {{is believed to have been}} used to maintain oral health.

40|$|The {{properties}} of <b>mastics</b> are {{fundamental to the}} performance of many types of hot mix in current use. Whilst some fillers appear chemically inert in <b>mastics,</b> others are considered as chemically active. The way these different types of filler affect <b>mastics</b> and mixes was investigated. Limestone and hydrated lime fillers were incorporated into two binders- 100 penetration paving grade and an EVA polymer modified binder based on the same bitumen. The resultant <b>mastics</b> were assessed using several test procedures, on the bitumen, on the <b>mastics</b> and some on hot mix samples. The tests included rheology, Cantabro and net adsorption. The effect of short-term ageing of the binder was also investigated. The results showed the greatest effect was due to filler volume concentration whilst the short-term ageing caused substantially less change. With the materials studied, {{there was no evidence of}} significant hardening due to a chemical reaction between the active filler and the polymer modified binder...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Micromechanical {{models have}} been {{directly}} used to predict the effective complex modulus of asphalt <b>mastics</b> from the mechanical properties of their constituents. Because the micromechanics models traditionally employed {{have been based on}} elastic theory, the viscoelastic effects of binders have not been considered. Moreover, due to the unique features of asphalt <b>mastics</b> such as high concentration and irregular shape of filler particles, some micromechanical models may not be suitable. A comprehensive investigation of four existing micromechanical methods is conducted considering viscoelastic effects. It is observed that the self-consistent model well predicts the experimental results without introducing any calibration; whereas the Mori-Tanaka model and the generalized self-consistent model, which have been widely used for asphalt materials, significantly underestimate the complex Young’s modulus. Assuming binders to be incompressible and fillers to be rigid, the dilute model and the self-consistent model provide the same prediction, but they considerably overestimate the complex Young’s modulus. The analyses suggest that these conventional assumptions are invalid for asphalt <b>mastics</b> at low temperatures and high frequencies. In addition, contradictory to the assumption of the previous elastic model, it is found that the phase angle of binders produces considerable effects on the absolute value of the complex modulus of <b>mastics...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of finishes applied to polyester fibers on the properties of asphalt binders and <b>mastics.</b> Asphalt binders were mixed with finishes that were extracted from the fibers, and <b>mastics</b> were also made with binder and fibers (with and without finish) to isolate the effects of the finish. The results indicated that crude source plays a significant role in how the fiber finish affects the binders and <b>mastics.</b> Additionally different finishes had different effects on binder properties. The major finding of this study is that different polyester fibers, even from the same manufacturer, may not necessarily perform the same in an asphalt mixture. It is important to use fibers that are compatible with the particular asphalt binder that is being used because of the significance of the binder source on the interaction between the finish and the binder...|$|R

500|$|As lord of Chios, Martino and Benedetto {{fought with}} {{distinction}} against the Turkish pirates, who made their {{appearance in the}} Aegean {{in the early years}} of the 14th century. In 1304, the capture of Ephesus by the emirate of Menteshe had sparked the Genoese occupation of Chios, and raids against the Aegean islands intensified over the next years. The Emirate of Aydin soon emerged as the chief Turkish maritime emirate, especially under the leadership of Umur Bey, while the Zaccaria, along with the Knights Hospitaller of Rhodes, became the two main Latin antagonists of the Turkish pirates. The Zaccaria are reported to have maintained a thousand infantry, a hundred horsemen and a couple of galleys on constant alert. In 1317, they lost the citadel of Smyrna on the Anatolian coast to the Aydinids, but continued to hold on to the lower city until 1329, when Umur Bey captured it. [...] In 1319, however, Martino Zaccaria participated with seven ships in a Hospitaller fleet that scored a crushing victory over an Aydinid fleet from Ephesus. By the end of his rule on Chios, Martino is said to have taken captive or slain more than 10,000 Turks, and received an annual tribute in order not to attack them. His constant efforts against the Turkish pirates earned him great praise by contemporary Latin writers, who wrote that if not for his vigilance, [...] "neither man, nor woman, nor dog, nor cat, nor any live animal could have remained in any of the neighbouring islands". Martino also intervened to stop the slave trade carried out by the Genoese of Alexandria, for which he was praised by Pope John XXII.
