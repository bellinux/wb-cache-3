5|$|A serious {{industrial}} disaster was {{the dumping}} of mercury compounds into Minamata Bay, Japan. It {{is estimated that}} over 3,000 people suffered various deformities, severe mercury poisoning symptoms or death from {{what became known as}} <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals can degrade air, water, {{and soil}} quality, and {{subsequently}} cause health issues in plants, animals, and people, {{when they become}} concentrated {{as a result of}} industrial activities. Common sources of heavy metals in this context include mining and industrial wastes; vehicle emissions; lead-acid batteries; fertilisers; paints; and treated timber; aging water supply infrastructure; and microplastics floating in the world's oceans. Recent examples of heavy metal contamination and health risks include the occurrence of <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease,</b> in Japan (1932–1968; lawsuits ongoing as of 2016); the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil, and high levels of lead in drinking water supplied to the residents of Flint, Michigan, in the north-east of the United States.|$|E
40|$|Both {{animal and}} {{vegetable}} life depend for their existence on appropriate amounts of various trace elements, albelt in very small amounts. This paper lists {{some of these}} trace elements and the ailments in which they play an important role. The elements discussed are gold, platinum, copper, lead, zinc, aluminum, silica, mercury, cadmium, selenium, arsenic, and iodine. The diseases involved range from multiple sclerosis, various cancers, arthritis, goitre, Down's Syndrome, and mental retardation. Less well known are Keshan, Alzheimer's, Itai-Itai, and <b>Minamata</b> <b>diseases.</b> Of particular interest {{in the latter part}} of the twentieth century is the discovery that serious deficiencies of either copper or zinc in the diet of animals may break down their immune defence mechanisms.

5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
5|$|Balaji Sadasivan {{was born}} on 11 July 1955 in Singapore, the son of Indian immigrants. A student at Raffles Institution, Siglap Secondary School (1969–1971) and National Junior College (1972–1973), he {{subsequently}} studied medicine at the University of Singapore. In his second year, he won an essay competition organised by the World Health Organization (WHO) and received the opportunity to attend a healthcare workshop in Minamata, Japan, where he learned about the devastating effects of <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease,</b> a neurological syndrome caused by severe mercury poisoning. This led him to specialise in neurosurgery later on, which was not a popular discipline at the time. In 1979, Sadasivan graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S.), {{and two years later}} embarked on further studies at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (F.R.C.S.) in 1984. He trained at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, between 1985 and 1990, obtaining a diploma from the American Board of Neurology Surgery and becoming a fellow at Harvard University in 1990. He also worked at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a teaching affiliate of Harvard, and at the Children's Hospital Boston in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1997, he obtained a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B. (Hons.)) from the University of London.|$|E
25|$|A second {{outbreak}} of <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> occurred in Niigata Prefecture in 1965. The original <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> and Niigata <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> are considered {{two of the}} four big pollution diseases of Japan.|$|E

25|$|The {{deception}} {{was successful}} {{and almost all}} parties involved in <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> were duped into believing that the factory's wastewater had been made safe from December 1959 onward. This widespread assumption meant that doctors were not expecting new patients to appear, resulting in numerous problems {{in the years to}} follow, as the pollution continued. In most people's minds, the issue of <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> had been resolved.|$|E
25|$|By 2007, a {{total of}} 2,668 people were {{certified}} as <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> patients, 639 of whom are alive today.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> {{attracted}} global {{attention in}} 1972 during the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm. The official report {{presented to the}} Conference by the Japanese government {{did not mention the}} disease at all; this lack of honesty resulted in a second report being put together by Japanese citizens. <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> patients were sent to Stockholm to hand in the citizens' report. Evidence of the misery caused by heavy environmental pollution revealed the downside of Japan's post-war rapid economic development to global public.|$|E
25|$|Ontario <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> is a {{neurological}} syndrome caused by severe mercury poisoning. It {{occurred in the}} Canadian province of Ontario, in 1970, and severely affected two First Nation communities in Northwestern Ontario following consumption of local fish contaminated with mercury, and one First Nation in Southern Ontario due to illegal disposal of industrial chemical waste. The disease was named after the infamous case of severe mercury poisoning in the fishing community of Minamata, Japan, which became known as <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> because it devastated only {{the residents of the}} community.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{environmental}} protests did result in Japan becoming more democratized, {{it did not}} completely rid Japan {{of the system that}} first suppressed the fishermen and victims of <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first {{patient with}} {{previously}} unseen neurological symptoms {{was reported in}} Minamata in 1956. In 1959, a researcher from Kumamoto University suspected that an organomercury compound could be the cause. However, paths of transformation of inorganic to organic mercury were unknown or uncertain {{at that time and}} so the effluent from Chisso was not identified as the sought source. It took 9 more years until the government officially acknowledged mercury-containing effluent from local acetaldehyde chemical plants to be the cause of <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease.</b> Since then, victims of the <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> have been compensated by Chisso and both local and national governments thanks to won lawsuits and official relief programmes.|$|E
25|$|Minamata {{is known}} due to <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease,</b> a {{neurological}} disorder caused by mercury poisoning. The disease {{was discovered in}} 1956. A local chemical plant was blamed for causing the disease by emitting untreated wastewater to the Minamata Bay.|$|E
25|$|Chisso {{failed to}} co-operate with the {{investigation}} team from Kumamoto University. It withheld information on its industrial processes, leaving researchers to speculate what products the factory was producing and by what methods. The Chisso factory's hospital director, Hajime Hosokawa, established a laboratory in the research division of the plant {{to carry out his}} own experiments into <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> in July 1959. Food to which factory wastewater had been added was fed to healthy cats. Seventy-eight days into the experiment, cat 400 exhibited symptoms of <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> and pathological examinations confirmed a diagnosis of organic mercury poisoning. The company did not reveal these significant results to the investigators and ordered Hosokawa to stop his research.|$|E
25|$|A {{memorial}} service {{was held at}} the <b>Minamata</b> <b>Disease</b> Municipal Museum on 1 May 2006 to mark 50 years since the official discovery of the disease. Despite bad weather, the service was attended by over 600 people, including Chisso chairman Shunkichi Goto and Environment Minister Yuriko Koike.|$|E
25|$|While {{the struggles}} of the {{arbitration}} and litigation groups against Chisso were continuing, {{a new group of}} <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> sufferers emerged. To qualify for compensation under the 1959 agreement, patients had to be officially recognised by various ad hoc certification committees according to their symptoms. However, in an effort to limit the liability and financial burden on the company, these committees were sticking to a rigid interpretation of <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease.</b> They required that patients must exhibit all symptoms of Hunter-Russell syndrome – the standard diagnosis of organic mercury poisoning at the time – which originated from an industrial accident in the United Kingdom in 1940. The committee certified only patients exhibiting explicit symptoms of the British syndrome, rather than basing their diagnosis on the disease in Japan. This resulted in many applicants being rejected by the committee, leaving them confused and frustrated.|$|E
25|$|Through the {{evolution}} of public sentiments, the victims and environmental protesters were able to acquire standing and proceed more effectively in their cause. The involvement of the press also aided the process of democratization because it caused more people {{to become aware of}} the facts of <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> and the pollution that caused it.|$|E
25|$|During the {{investigation}} {{by researchers at}} Kumamoto University, the causal substance had {{been identified as a}} heavy metal and it was widely presumed that the Chisso plant was the source of the contamination. Chisso was coming under closer scrutiny and to deflect criticism, the wastewater output route was changed. Chisso knew of the environmental damage caused by its wastewater and was well aware that it was the prime suspect in the <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> investigation. Despite this, from September 1958, instead of discharging its waste into Hyakken Harbour (the focus of investigation and source of original contamination), it discharged wastewater directly into Minamata River. The immediate effect was the death of fish {{at the mouth of the}} river, and from that point on, new <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> victims began to appear in other fishing villages up and down the coast of the Shiranui Sea, as the pollution spread over an even greater area.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> {{broke out}} again in 1965, this time {{along the banks}} of the Agano River in Niigata Prefecture. The polluting factory (owned by Showa Denko) {{employed}} a chemical process using a mercury catalyst very similar to that used by Chisso in Minamata. As in Minamata, from the autumn of 1964 to the spring of 1965, cats living {{along the banks of}} the Agano River had been seen to go mad and die. Before long, patients appeared with identical symptoms to patients living on the Shiranui Sea, and the outbreak was made public on 12 June 1965. Researchers from the Kumamoto University Research Group and Hajime Hosokawa (who had retired from Chisso in 1962) used their experience from Minamata and applied it to the Niigata outbreak. In September 1966, a report was issued proving Showa Denko's pollution to be the cause of this second <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
25|$|As of March 2001, 2,265 {{victims had}} been officially {{recognised}} as having <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> (1,784 {{of whom had}} died) and over 10,000 had received financial compensation from Chisso. By 2004, Chisso Corporation had paid $86 million in compensation, {{and in the same}} year was ordered to clean up its contamination. On March 29, 2010, a settlement was reached to compensate as-yet uncertified victims.|$|E
25|$|As of March 2001, 2,265 {{victims have}} been officially {{certified}} (1,784 {{of whom have}} died) and over 10,000 people have received financial compensation from Chisso, although they are not recognised as official victims. The issue of quantifying the impact of <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> is complicated, as a full epidemiological study has never been conducted and patients were recognised only if they voluntarily applied to a certification council to seek financial compensation. Many victims of <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> faced discrimination and ostracism from the local community if they came {{out into the open}} about their symptoms. Some people feared the disease to be contagious, and many local people were fiercely loyal to Chisso, depending on the company for their livelihoods. In this atmosphere, sufferers were reluctant to come forward and seek certification. Despite these factors, over 17,000 people have applied to the council for certification. Also, in recognising an applicant as a <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> sufferer, the certification council qualified that patient to receive financial compensation from Chisso. For that reason, the council has always been under immense pressure to reject claimants and minimise the financial burden placed on Chisso. Rather than being a council of medical recognition, the decisions of the council were always affected by the economic and political factors surrounding Minamata and the Chisso corporation. Furthermore, compensation of the victims led to continued strife in the community, including unfounded accusations that {{some of the people who}} sought compensation did not actually suffer from the disease. More properly, the impact should be called a criminal 'poisoning', not a clinical 'disease'. These forms of obfuscation are commonly experienced by 'environmental victims' in many countries.|$|E
25|$|Local {{doctors and}} medical {{officials}} had noticed {{for a long}} time an abnormally high frequency of cerebral palsy and other infantile disorders in the Minamata area. In 1961, a number of medical professionals including Masazumi Harada (later to receive an honour from the United Nations for his body of work on <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease)</b> set about re-examining children diagnosed with cerebral palsy. The symptoms of the children closely mirrored those of adult <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> patients, but many of their mothers did not exhibit symptoms. The fact that these children had been born after the initial outbreak and had never been fed contaminated fish also led their mothers to believe they were not victims. At the time the medical establishment believed the placenta would protect the foetus from toxins in the bloodstream, which is indeed the case with most chemicals. What was not known at the time was that exactly the opposite is the case with methylmercury: the placenta removes it from the mother's bloodstream and concentrates the chemical in the foetus.|$|E
25|$|Photographic {{documentation}} of Minamata {{started in the}} early 1960s. One photographer who arrived in 1960 was Shisei Kuwabara, straight from university and photo school, who had his photographs published in Weekly Asahi as early as May 1960. The first exhibition of his photographs of Minamata {{was held in the}} Fuji Photo Salon in Tokyo in 1962, and the first of his book-length anthologies, <b>Minamata</b> <b>Disease,</b> was published in Japan in 1965. He has returned to Minamata many times since.|$|E
25|$|However, a {{dramatic}} photographic essay by W. Eugene Smith brought world attention to <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease.</b> His Japanese wife {{and he lived}} in Minamata from 1971 to 1973. The most famous and striking photo of the essay, Tomoko Uemura in Her Bath (1972) shows Ryoko Uemura, holding her severely deformed daughter, Tomoko, in a Japanese bath chamber. Tomoko was poisoned by methylmercury while still in the womb. The photo was very widely published. It was posed by Smith with the co-operation of Ryoko and Tomoko to dramatically illustrate {{the consequences of the}} disease. It has subsequently been withdrawn from circulation at the request of Tomoko's family, so does not appear in recent anthologies of Smith's works. Smith and his wife were extremely dedicated to the cause of the victims of <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease,</b> closely documenting their struggle for recognition and right to compensation. Smith was himself attacked and seriously injured by Chisso employees in an incident in Goi, Ichihara city, near Tokyo on January 7, 1972, in an attempt to stop the photographer from further revealing the issue to the world. The 54-year-old Smith survived the attack, but his sight in one eye deteriorated and his health never fully recovered before his death in 1978.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{people in the}} Grassy Narrows and Whitedog First Nations populations started to suffer {{symptoms}} of mercury poisoning. Several Japanese doctors who {{had been involved in}} studying <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> in Japan travelled to Canada to investigate the mercury poisoning in these people. Blood mercury levels were above 100ppb in a significant number of individuals and above 200ppb in several others. Symptoms included sensory disturbances, such as narrowing of the visual field, and impaired hearing, abnormal eye movements, tremor, ataxia (impaired balance), and dysarthria (poor articulation of speech).|$|E
25|$|Outbreaks of {{methylmercury}} poisoning occurred {{in several places}} in Japan during the 1950s due to industrial discharges of mercury into rivers and coastal waters. The best-known instances were in Minamata and Niigata. In Minamata alone, more than 600 people died due to {{what became known as}} <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease.</b> More than 21,000 people filed claims with the Japanese government, of which almost 3000 became certified as having the disease. In 22 documented cases, pregnant women who consumed contaminated fish showed mild or no symptoms but gave birth to infants with severe developmental disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Mercury {{poisoning}} {{is a type}} {{of metal}} poisoning due to mercury exposure. Symptoms depend upon the type, dose, method, and duration of exposure. They may include muscle weakness, poor coordination, numbness in the hands and feet, skin rashes, anxiety, memory problems, trouble speaking, trouble hearing, or trouble seeing. High level exposure to methylmercury is known as <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease.</b> Methylmercury exposure in children may result in acrodynia (pink's disease) in which the skin becomes pink and peels. Long-term complications may include kidney problems and decreased intelligence. The effects of long-term low-dose exposure to methylmercury is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Most {{congenital}} {{patients are}} now in their forties and fifties and their health is deteriorating. Their parents, who are often their only source of care, are into their seventies or eighties or already deceased. Often these patients find themselves tied to their own homes and the care of their family, effectively isolated from the local community. Some welfare facilities for patients do exist. One notable example is , a vocational training centre for congenital patients {{as well as other}} disabled people in the Minamata area. Hot House members are also involved in raising awareness of <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease,</b> often attending conferences and seminars as well as making regular visits to elementary schools throughout Kumamoto Prefecture.|$|E
25|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. This is because mercury is stored in the muscle tissues of fish, and when a predatory fish eats another fish, it assumes the entire body burden of mercury in the consumed fish. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. The first occurrence of widespread mercury poisoning in humans occurred this way in Minamata, Japan, now called <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
25|$|The second {{goal is to}} have {{safe and}} {{reliable}} production in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. The emphasis in this project is on local food production to reduce food mileage. Local agriculture produces mostly rice, mandarins and local salad onions. After the <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease</b> scandal local farmers wanted to show that their products were safe, so they changed their way of production by: not using pesticides anymore, use 70% less fertilizer and instead started using a special fertilizer from Chisso. In the 2011 environmental report the local production was stable for the last 10 years and the advice was to promote local production. Fishing was not possible from 1970 till 1997, because the bay was closed with a net to prevent the catching of contaminated fish. During this period fishers were compensated by the local government. When the nets were removed sardine catching started to flourish and there now are full-time and part-time fishers, who combine fishing with other jobs.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, severe mercury poisoning, called Ontario <b>Minamata</b> <b>disease,</b> was {{discovered}} among Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation and Wabaseemoong Independent Nations people, who lived near Dryden, Ontario. There was extensive mercury pollution caused by Dryden Chemicals Company's waste water effluent in the Wabigoon-English River system. Because local fish {{were no longer}} safe to eat, the Ontario provincial government closed the commercial fisheries run by the First Nation people and ordered them to stop eating local fish. Previously it had made {{up the majority of}} their diet. In addition to the acute mercury poisoning in northwestern Ontario, Aamjiwnaang First Nation people near Sarnia, Ontario, experienced a wide range of chemical effects, including severe mercury poisoning. They suffered low birth rates, skewed birth-gender ratio, and health effects among the population. This led to legislation and eventually the Indian Health Transfer Policy that provided a framework for the assumption of control of health services by First Nations people, and set forth a developmental approach to transfer centred on the concept of self-determination in health. Through this process, the decision to enter into transfer discussions with Health Canada rests with each community. Once involved in transfer, communities are able to take control of health programme responsibilities at a pace determined by their individual circumstances and health management capabilities.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, hair {{samples from}} 1,137 Taiji {{residents}} were tested for mercury by the National Institute for <b>Minamata</b> <b>Disease.</b> [...] The average amount of methyl mercury {{found in the}} hair samples was 11.0 parts per million for men and 6.63 ppm for women, compared {{with an average of}} 2.47 ppm for men and 1.64 ppm for women in tests conducted in 14 other locations in Japan. [...] One hundred eighty-two Taiji residents showing extremely high mercury levels underwent further medical testing to check for symptoms of mercury poisoning. [...] None of the Taiji residents displayed any of the traditional symptoms of mercury poisoning, according to the Institute.|$|E
