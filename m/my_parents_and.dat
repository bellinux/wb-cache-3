25|$|I {{remember}} {{going out to}} bat at 5pm and Andy Roberts had just taken the second new ball. I had a really close lbw decision when I had scored about five. I knew I'd hit it but I didn't know that Robin Bailhache, the umpire, knew that I hit it. But thankfully he gave me not out. I went into lunch {{the next day at}} 99 not out and I was so happy to get a century with <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> friends watching.|$|E

I found that by keeping to myself I got on OK. I don't know why." [...] When Williams was nine, her family moved to San Diego, California. She became interested in acting {{at an early age}} when she saw a local production of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.|$|E
500|$|Miliband is of Jewish heritage—the first Jewish {{leader of}} the Labour Party—and {{describes}} himself as a Jewish atheist. After marrying Thornton in a civil ceremony on 27 May 2011, he paid tribute to his Jewish heritage by following the tradition of breaking a glass. In 2012, Miliband wrote, [...] "Like many others from Holocaust families, I have a paradoxical relationship with this history. On one level I feel intimately connected with it – this happened to <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> grandparents. On another, it feels like a totally different world." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Live to Tell" [...] {{portrays the}} {{complexity}} of deceit and mistrust. The song is also about childhood scars and had an extreme emotional pitch. According to the book The Heart of Rock & Soul by Dave Marsh, the archetype of songs like [...] "Live to Tell" [...] is The Platters' song [...] "The Great Pretender". In an interview about the song, Madonna said, [...] "I thought about my relationship with <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> the lying that went on. The song is about being strong, and questioning whether you can be that strong but ultimately surviving." ...|$|E

At the age of sixteen, after he starting working at the radio station full-time, he unofficially dropped out of high school. Dahl later explained, [...] "I convinced <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> the school that I would do an independent work-study thing. I never got around to it." [...] At the age of eighteen, he obtained his GED and briefly married a woman he met after she called him on-air to request Suzanne, a song by Leonard Cohen which told a tale of a troubled relationship. Dahl later explained his short-lived marriage by commenting, [...] "I should have paid more attention to that song." ...|$|E
500|$|The band's {{debut album}} {{warranted}} a Parental Advisory label {{because of the}} album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song [...] "Daddy" [...] was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: [...] "When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really {{like to talk about}} that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it..." [...] "Kill You" [...] was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother. Follow the Leader marked the first album where the majority of the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like [...] "Justin" [...] and [...] "Pretty" [...] written about incidents occurring during adulthood.|$|E

2500|$|In 1902, early {{literary}} ambitions led to {{the publication}} of two stories [...] "The Legend of the Bean" [...] and [...] "The Sacrifice of the White Dog" [...] in {{a publication of the}} Episcopal Church Mission to the Oneidas. In 1903, Kellogg said, [...] "Perhaps it seems strange to an outsider, for I know the ideas that prevail in regards to Indian life, but to do something great when I grew up was impressed upon me from my cradle from <b>my</b> <b>parents,</b> <b>and</b> I've no other ambition and I have known no other ambition.” ...|$|E

2500|$|On 30 August 1961, Diana was baptised at St. Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham. She {{had three}} siblings: Sarah, Jane, and Charles. Her infant brother, John, died {{shortly after his}} birth one year before Diana was born. The desire for an heir added strain to the Spencers' marriage, and Lady Althorp was {{reportedly}} sent to Harley Street clinics in London to {{determine the cause of}} the [...] "problem". The experience was described as [...] "humiliating" [...] by Diana's younger brother, Charles: [...] "It was a dreadful time for <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> probably the root of their divorce because I don't think they ever got over it." [...] Diana grew up in Park House, situated on the Sandringham estate. The Spencers leased the house from its owner, Queen Elizabeth II. The Royal Family frequently holidayed at the neighbouring Sandringham House, and Diana played with Princes Andrew and Edward as a child.|$|E
2500|$|Reviewers wrote, and Miller later confirmed, that a {{recurring}} theme in the lyrics of Real Nighttime was life after college, which Miller paired with the intuition that [...] "freedom had a strong aspect of being bad news." [...] The song [...] "24" [...] placed the narrator at the cusp of a quarter-life crisis, as a self-conscious young adult whose mixed feelings established that he [...] "doesn't know where he fits, or to how to live on his own, in a post-collegiate milieu." [...] The theme continued with allusions to finding one's own direction and leaving the nest, as in [...] "Curse of the Frontier Land" [...] ("A year ago we called this a good time"), and [...] "I Mean It This Time" [...] ("Give me all the gin I need, for I may not be this strong when I call <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> tell them they've been wrong.") ...|$|E

2500|$|The cast of V {{features}} {{a number of}} actors from other science-fiction series, including Lost, Firefly and Smallville. Peters has stated that the casting of so many actors from a science-fiction background was coincidental, explaining: [...] "Obviously, we went for the best actors we could possibly find. It's a nice bonus {{that a lot of}} these folks have appeared in genre shows in the past, but it was not designed that way. We also wanted to make sure that as we moved forward, we honoured and respected the characters and the themes that the (original) show envisioned, while introducing brand new characters and brand new themes that make sense in a post-9/11 world." [...] Mitchell was a fan of the original series as a child, recalling: [...] "I liked the escape of it; I liked the entertainment of it. It was a fun night for me. I was allowed to watch an hour of television with <b>my</b> <b>parents,</b> <b>and</b> we made a kind of celebration of it. I hope that other teenagers will do that with their parents with this show." [...] Mitchell's role in V sees her play an FBI agent with traits traditionally assigned to males. She commented: [...] "I like playing a traditional hero. I don't think I've ever done it before. Sigourney Weaver said she always chooses male roles because they are meatier." [...] Mitchell characterizes Erica as having [...] "a little bit of a hero complex", but [...] "her joy and her love and her true affection is with her son, and the fact that he is in imminent danger (makes it) fun to play." ...|$|E
