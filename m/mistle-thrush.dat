60|$|The {{characteristic}} {{species of}} this part of the down country, comprising the parish of Winterbourne Bishop, are the pewit, magpie, turtledove, <b>mistle-thrush,</b> and starling. The pewit is universal on the hills, but will inevitably be driven away from all that portion of Salisbury Plain used for military purposes. The <b>mistle-thrush</b> becomes common in summer after its early breeding season is ended, when the birds in small flocks resort to the downs, where they continue until cold weather drives them away to the shelter of the wooded, low country.|$|E
6000|$|There was no ravens' breeding-place {{very near}} Winterbourne Bishop. Caleb had [...] "never heared tell of a nestie"; {{but he had}} once seen the nest of another species which is {{supposed}} never to breed in this country. He was a small boy at the time, when one day an old shepherd of the place going out from the village saw Caleb, and calling to him said, [...] "You're the boy that likes birds; if you'll come with me, I'll show 'ee what no man ever seed afore"; and Caleb, fired with curiosity, followed him away to a distance from home, out from the downs, {{into the woods and}} to a place where he had never been, where there were bracken and heath with birch and thorn-trees scattered about. On cautiously approaching a clump of birches they saw a big, thrush-like bird fly out of a large nest about ten feet from the ground, and settle on a tree close by, where it was joined by its mate. The old man pointed out that it was a felt or fieldfare, a thrush nearly as big as the <b>mistle-thrush</b> but different in colour, and he said that it was a bird that came to England in flocks in winter from no man knows where, far off in the north, and always went away before breeding-time. This was the only felt he had ever seen breeding in this country, and he [...] "didn't believe that no man had ever seed such a thing before." [...] He would not climb the tree to see the eggs, or even go very near it, for fear of disturbing the birds.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Phoradendron mucronatum and P. microphyllum are {{plants that}} found in {{tropical}} and subtropical areas, used in traditional medicine and popularly known as <b>mistle-thrush.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the chemical constituents of different leaf extracts from P. mucronatum and P. microphyllum and assess cytotoxic activity against strains from a human tumour cells. Extracts obtained with hexane, dichloromethane, chloroform and ethyl acetate from the leaves were analysed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and the cytotoxicity was assessed by the MTT method (bromide (3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide)). The tested human tumour cells were NCI-H 292 (human pulmonar mucoepidermoid carcinoma), MCF- 7 (human breast adenocarcinoma) and HEp- 2 (epidermoid carcinoma of the larynx). Analysis by GC/MS of the extracts from leaves of P. microphyllum and P. mucronatum detected 51 different compounds, such as alkaloids, diterpenes, triterpenes, sterols, alcohols, aldehydes, fatty acids and hydrocarbons. In the cytotoxic evaluation, hexane and ethyl acetate extracts from the leaves P. microphyllum inhibited cell growth of NCI-H 292 strains (72. 97 %) and HEp- 2 (87. 53 %), respectively. The extracts of P. mucronatum species showed an inhibitory effect towards NCI-H 292 (83. 19 %/hexane), MCF- 7 (88. 69 %/dichloromethane) and HEp- 2 (93. 40 %/hexane). The extracts showed cytotoxic activity against the tested strains, especially the P. mucronatum, which presented the highest percentages of inhibition of cell growth...|$|E
