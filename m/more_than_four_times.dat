Likewise, Romanian military capability declined {{because of a}} lack of fuel as well as training.

He was given an eight-week suspended sentence on 9 December 2010.|$|E

Unlike in similar historical situations, none of the junta members stood for election.

25|$|The song {{structure}} {{consists of}} four pushups, singing the chorus and verse through four times. In each chorus the melody is introduced or led off by the lead singer whose is then seconded by another singer who begins to vary the melody {{before the end of}} the leader's first line. They are then joined by the entire chorus for the rest of the pushup. Three down strokes or hard beats mark the end of the chorus and beginning of the verse, and during these drummers will alter their dancing such as by hopping low like fancy dancers. An increase in tempo and volume on the last five beats marks the end of the final verse. The dancing stops on the final beat and then a tail, or coda, finishes the song with a shortened chorus. Sometimes a drum group will sing the song <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>times,</b> particularly when the song feels good and the singers seize the moment for an extra pushup or two (or more), or when a dancer blows a whistle or passes his staff or fan over the drum to signal that the song is to be continued four extra pushups while he prays.|$|E
