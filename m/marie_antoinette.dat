5|$|In 1798, Tsar Paul I of Russia offered Louis {{the use of}} Jelgava Palace in Courland (now Latvia). Paul I also {{guaranteed}} Louis's {{safety and}} bestowed upon him a generous pension, however, the tsar later disregarded this allowance. Marie-Thérèse finally joined Louis XVIII at Jelgava in 1799. In the winter of 1798–1799, Louis XVIII wrote a biography of <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette</b> titled Réflexions Historiques sur <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette.</b> He attempted to recreate the court life of Versailles at Jelgava, where many old courtiers lived, re-establishing all the court ceremonies, including the lever and coucher (ceremonies that accompanied waking and bedding, respectively).|$|E
5|$|In autumn 1783, Pitt, Wilberforce and Edward Eliot (later {{to become}} Pitt's brother-in-law), {{travelled}} to France for a six-week holiday together. After a difficult start in Rheims, where their presence aroused police suspicion {{that they were}} English spies, they visited Paris, meeting Benjamin Franklin, General Lafayette, <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette</b> and Louis XVI, and joined the French court at Fontainebleau.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May 1778, Dr. Lassonne, Marie Antoinette's private physician, {{confirmed}} her pregnancy. On 19 December 1778, the Queen {{gave birth}} to a daughter, who was named Marie-Thérèse Charlotte de France and given the honorific title Madame Royale. The birth of a girl came as a relief to the Count of Provence, who kept his position as heir to Louis XVI, since Salic Law excluded women from acceding to the throne of France. However, Louis Stanislas did not remain heir to the throne much longer. On 22 October 1781, <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette</b> {{gave birth to}} the Dauphin Louis Joseph. Louis Stanislas and his brother, the Count of Artois, served as godfathers by proxy for Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, the queen's brother. When <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette</b> gave birth to her second son, Louis Charles, in March 1785, Louis Stanislas slid further down the line of succession.|$|E

5|$|From 1789 until 1792, {{when the}} French royal court {{resided in the}} Tuileries, the {{apartment}} of {{the ground floor of}} the Pavillon de Flore housed the office of the princesse de Lamballe, being {{side by side with the}} apartment of queen <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette</b> in the ground floor of the main building of the Tuileries, while the first floor of the Pavillon housed the apartment of Madame Elisabeth.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} a bridge, {{they reached the}} gardens {{in front of the}} palace, and Moberly noticed a lady sketching on the grass who looked at them. She later described what she saw in great detail: the lady was wearing a light summer dress, on her head was a shady white hat, and she had lots of fair hair. Moberly thought she was a tourist at first, but the dress appeared to be old-fashioned. Moberly came to believe that the lady was <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette.</b> Jourdain, however, did not see the lady.|$|E
5|$|In 1841, Beauregard married <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette</b> Laure Villeré (March 22, 1823 – March 21, 1850), the {{daughter}} of Jules Villeré, a sugar cane planter in Plaquemines Parish {{and a member of}} one of the most prominent French Creole families in southern Louisiana. Marie's paternal grandfather was Jacques Villeré, the second governor of Louisiana. She was described as having blue eyes and fair skin. The couple had three children: Judge René Toutant (1843–1910), Henri Toutant (1845–1915), and Laure (1850–1884). Marie died in March 1850, while giving birth to Laure.|$|E

5|$|In April 1770, Maria Theresa's {{youngest}} daughter, Maria Antonia, married Louis, Dauphin of France, {{by proxy}} in Vienna. Maria Antonia's education was neglected, {{and when the}} French showed an interest in her, her mother went about educating her {{as best she could}} about the court of Versailles and the French. Maria Theresa kept up a fortnightly correspondence with Maria Antonia, now called <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette,</b> in which she often reproached her for laziness and frivolity and scolded her for failing to conceive a child.|$|E
5|$|King Louis XV of France {{stayed in}} the palace from 5 to 10October 1744. Maria Josepha of Saxony, Dauphine of France, spent two nights in the palace from 27 to 29January 1747. Queen <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette</b> spent her first night on French soil there on 7 to 8May 1770. In 1805, 1806, and 1809 Emperor Napoleon spent several nights in the palace; his wife, Empress Josephine stayed for longer periods, from September 1805 until January 1806 (Battle of Austerlitz), and from May until July 1809 (Battles of Aspern-Essling and of Battle of Wagram).|$|E
5|$|Maria Theresa was {{not just}} {{critical}} of <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette.</b> She disliked Leopold's reserve and often blamed him for being cold. She criticised Maria Carolina for her political activities, Ferdinand for his lack of organisation, and Maria Amalia for her poor French and haughtiness. The only child she did not constantly scold was Maria Christina, who enjoyed her mother's complete confidence, though she failed to please her mother in one aspect – she did not produce any surviving children.|$|E

5|$|The Palais Rohan (Rohan Palace) in Strasbourg is {{the former}} {{residence}} of the prince-bishops and cardinals of the House of Rohan, an ancient French noble family originally from Brittany. It is a major architectural, historical, and cultural landmark in the city. It was built next to Strasbourg Cathedral in the 1730s, from designs by Robert de Cotte, and is considered a masterpiece of French Baroque architecture. Since its completion in 1742, the palace has hosted a number of French monarchs such as Louis XV, <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette,</b> Napoleon and Joséphine, and Charles X.|$|E
5|$|The crowd {{traveled}} {{the distance from}} Paris to Versailles in about six hours. Among their makeshift weaponry they dragged along several cannons taken from the Hôtel de Ville. Boisterous and energetic, they recruited (or impressed into service) more and more followers as they surged out of Paris in the autumn rain. In their ambiguous but always aggressive poissard slang, they chattered enthusiastically about bringing the king back home. Less affectionately, they spoke of the queen, <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette,</b> and many had no restraint in calling for her death.|$|E

5|$|As {{the rhetoric}} grew more strident, however, the other monarchies started to view events with alarm. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791, he {{considered}} the situation surrounding his sister, the French Queen <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette,</b> and her children, with greater and greater alarm. In August 1791, in consultation with French émigré nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pilnitz, in which they declared {{the interest of the}} monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family.|$|E
5|$|Class distinction, however, became linked as {{the fashion}} of female homoeroticism passed. Tribades were {{simultaneously}} considered members of the lower class trying to ruin virtuous women, and representatives of an aristocracy corrupt with debauchery. Satirical writers began to suggest that political rivals (or more often, their wives) engaged in tribadism in order to harm their reputations. Queen Anne was rumored to have a passionate relationship with Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, her closest adviser and confidante. When Churchill was ousted as the queen's favorite, she purportedly spread allegations of the queen having affairs with her bedchamberwomen. <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette</b> was also the subject of such speculation for some months between 1795 and 1796.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Louis Stanislas was not {{infatuated}} with his wife, he boasted that the two enjoyed vigorous conjugal relations– but such declarations were held in low esteem by courtiers at Versailles. He also proclaimed his wife to be pregnant merely to spite Louis Auguste and his wife <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette,</b> {{who had not yet}} consummated their marriage. The Dauphin and Louis Stanislas did not enjoy a harmonious relationship and often quarrelled, as did their wives. Louis Stanislas did impregnate his wife in 1774, having conquered his aversion. However, the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. A second pregnancy in 1781 also miscarried, and the marriage remained childless.|$|E

5|$|The ancestral {{origins of}} the Maine Coon are unknown — there are only {{speculation}} and folk tales. One such folk tale involves <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette,</b> the Queen of France, who was executed in 1793. The story goes that before her death, Antoinette attempted to escape France {{with the help of}} Captain Samuel Clough. She loaded Clough's ship with her most prized possessions, including six of her favorite Turkish Angora cats. Although she did not make it to the United States, her pets safely reached the shores of Wiscasset, Maine, where they bred with other short-haired breeds and developed into the modern breed of the Maine Coon.|$|E
5|$|The {{suggestion}} {{has also}} been made that Jack and Jill represent Louis XVI of France, who was deposed and beheaded in 1793 (lost his crown), and his Queen <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette</b> (who came tumbling after), a theory made difficult {{by the fact that}} the earliest printing of the rhyme pre-dates those events. There is also a local belief that the rhyme records events in the village of Kilmersdon in Somerset in 1697 when a local spinster became pregnant; the putative father is said to have died from a rock fall and the woman died in childbirth soon after.|$|E
5|$|They {{visited the}} Trianon gardens again on several occasions, but {{were unable to}} trace the path they took.

During their research, they thought they recognised the man by the kiosk as the Comte de Vaudreuil, a friend of <b>Marie</b> <b>Antoinette,</b> who herself had been thought to have been seen by Moberly.|$|E
