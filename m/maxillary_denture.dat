40|$|Background and objectives: The {{fracture}} of acrylic <b>maxillary</b> complete <b>dentures</b> is a commonly seen clinical problem which usually occurs due to heavy occlusal forces or accidental damage. The {{objectives of the}} study were to measure the impact strength of <b>maxillary</b> complete <b>dentures</b> fabricated with high impact acrylic resin and to evaluate the effect of woven E-glass fiber and silane treated glass fiber reinforcement on the impact strength of the <b>Maxillary</b> complete <b>dentures.</b> Methods:One commercially available heat cured acrylic resin (Trevalon HI) was selected. Preimpregnated woven E-glass fibers (Stick Net) and Silane treated glass fibers were used to reinforce ten <b>maxillary</b> complete <b>dentures</b> each. Ten unreinforced complete dentures served as the control group. The impact strength in Joules of the dentures were measured with a falling-weight impact test. Results: The mean impact strength of the control dentures was 75. 22 +/- 10. 392 J at crack initiation, and 84. 62 +/- 11. 495 J at complete fracture. The mean impact strength of dentures reinforced with preimpregnated woven E-glass fibers was 165. 91 +/- 12. 929 J at crack initiation, and 187. 06 +/- 17. 972 J at complete fracture. The mean impact strength of dentures reinforced with silane treated glass fibers was 112. 30 +/- 8. 709 J at crack initiation, and at complete fracture was 126. 43 +/- 8. 709 J.

Material/Methods: Two <b>maxillary</b> complete <b>dentures</b> are made for each patient (total number of patients is 30) using both technologies. The magnitude of dislodging force is measured by a dynamometer. Results: Mean ± standard deviation for conventional cuvette technique is 17, 53 N ± 12, 11 N. Mean ± standard deviation for injection molding technique is 20, 73 N ± 13, 89 N. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed statistically significant differences in results achieved by conventional cuvette technique and injection molding technology.

40|$|Candida albicans is {{considered}} the most important Candida species able to cause oral infections in denture wearers. In recent years, Candida dubliniensis {{has emerged as a}} pathogenic yeast in humans. The close phenotypic similarities of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis have led to the misidentification of these species. In this work, our aim was to verify through PCR the presence of C. dubliniensis in palate and <b>maxillary</b> <b>denture</b> samples from 112 denture wearers presenting with or without denture-related stomatitis (DRS). C. dubliniensis was isolated at low rates from both palate (5. 3 % and 10. 7 %) and <b>maxillary</b> <b>denture</b> (5. 3 % and 8. 9 %) samples from wearers regardless of the presence of the disease. However, when C. dubliniensis was detected in individuals with DRS, it was always associated with C. albicans.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} surgical and prosthetic care and aftercare of maxillary overdentures supported by six endosseous implants and a milled bar mesostructure with Ceka attachments. Materials and Methods: Thirty-nine consecutive patients with an edentulous maxilla who reported problems wearing a conventional <b>maxillary</b> <b>denture</b> were treated with an overdenture supported by six endosseous implants and a milled bar mesostructure (solid bar with position Ceka attachments). Prosthetic and surgical care and aftercare were scored from the first visit until 10 years after the augmentation of the maxilla. Patient satisfaction was assessed at the end of follow-up. Results: On the basis of problems patients experienced with wearing their conventional dentures, three groups of patients were distinguished: patients with lack of retention of their conventional <b>maxillary</b> <b>denture</b> related to anatomic problems (n = 24), patients with gagging problems (n = 9), and patients not tolerating a conventional <b>maxillary</b> <b>denture</b> due to subjective problems not related to an anatomic substratum (n = 6). The need for care and aftercare was comparable between the three groups. The overall 10 -year implant survival rate was 86. 1 %. Loss of implants occurred mostly during the first year after placement. Surgical aftercare predominately consisted of care related to the removal and replacement of implants (ie, reaugmentation, replacement of implants, and abutment connection). Prosthetic aftercare consisted mainly of routine inspections, oral hygiene care, and activation or replacement of Ceka attachments. Finally, all patients functioned well with their overdentures and remained satisfied throughout the study. Conclusion. Irrespective of the mentioned underlying reasons for not functioning with a conventional <b>maxillary</b> <b>denture,</b> an implant-retained maxillary overdenture, opposed by either an implant-retained mandibular overdenture or natural dentition, was shown to be an effective, predictable, and reliable treatment option that did not need much aftercare other than adjustments of the Ceka attachments.

40|$|It is the {{responsibility}} of the dentist to fabricate a denture that is fully functional and perfectly esthetic. One prime oral function that has always been overlooked in this regard is speech.

Phonetics, esthetics, function and comfort form the foundation of a successful prosthodontic treatment. Accurate approximation of palatal contours of a <b>maxillary</b> complete <b>denture</b> to a patient′s tongue can improve speech intelligibility, if other factors such as tooth position, occlusal plane and occlusal vertical dimension are satisfactory.

To determine whether gradual increase in load or different posterior teeth positions in <b>maxillary</b> <b>denture</b> would influence the pattern of stress. Two groups of maxillary dentures were fabricated with different posterior teeth positions (Group I with teeth on the crest of the ridge; Group II with buccal to the crest of the ridge.) using casts prepared from prefabricated edentulous molds, with 5 dentures in each group. Two strain gauges were cemented on to the midline of each denture, one on the anterior palatal area and other on the posterior palatal area. The dentures were loaded from 0 to 110  N in steps of 10  N, and the strains induced were measured. Differences of the stress magnitudes between the 2 groups were statistically analyzed using Mann–Whitney U test. The anterior palatal area of the <b>maxillary</b> <b>denture</b> was dominated by a tensile stress, which was greater in the group II than in group I. The posterior palatal area was dominated by compressive stress but the outer placement of the maxillary teeth caused a significant decrease in the compressive stress.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{investigated}} how ribbed design features, including palatal rugae, {{may be used}} to significantly improve the structural performance of a <b>maxillary</b> <b>denture</b> under load. Materials and Methods: A computer-aided design model of a generic <b>maxillary</b> <b>denture,</b> incorporating various rib features, was created and imported into a finite element analysis program. The denture and ribbed features were assigned the material properties of standard denture acrylic resin, and load was applied in two different ways: the first simulating a three-point flexural bend of the posterior section and the second simulating loading of the entire palatal region. To investigate the combined use of ribbing and reinforcement, the same simulations were repeated with the ribbed features having a Young modulus two orders of magnitude greater than denture acrylic resin. For a prescribed load, total displacements of tracking nodes were compared to those of a control denture (without ribbing) to assess relative denture rigidity. Results: When subjected to flexural loading, an increase in rib depth was seen to result in a reduction of both the transverse displacement of the last molar and vertical displacement at the centerline. However, ribbed features assigned the material properties of denture acrylic resin require a depth that may impose on speech and bolus propulsion before significant improvements are observed. Conclusion: The use of ribbed features, when made from a significantly stiffer material (eg, fiber-reinforced polymer) and designed to mimic palatal rugae, offer an acceptable method of providing significant improvements in rigidity to a <b>maxillary</b> <b>denture</b> under flexural load...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{angulation}} of {{maxillary bone}} as the maxillary bone resorption occurs from a buccal to palatal direction, bucco-lingually tilted implant placement {{is more likely}} especially in the posterior maxilla.

Dentures with photosensitizers were left in the dark for 30 min (pre-irradiation time) and then irradiated with blue LED light at 37. 5 J/cm(2) (26 min). Denture samples were taken with sterile cotton swab before (left side surfaces) and after (right side surfaces) PDT. All microbial material was diluted and plated on selective media for Candida spp., Staphylococcus mutans spp., streptococci and a non-selective media. After incubation (48 h/ 37 A degrees C), the number of colony-forming units (cfu/ml) was counted. Microorganisms grown on selective media were identified using biochemical methods before and after PDT. The data were submitted to McNemar and Kruskal-Wallis tests (alpha = 0. 05). No growth after PDT was observed in 60, 53, 47, and 40 % of dentures from P 100 G, P 50 G, P 100 S, and P 50 S groups, respectively.

Twelve patients (4 women and 8 men) received {{a new set of}} conventional dentures, due to insufficient dentures. In nine patients (2 women and 7 men), the existing dentures were adjusted by means of relining or rebasing. All patients received implant-supported dentures on two retentive anchors. In total, 42 implants were inserted in the anterior maxilla. The participants rated their satisfaction on their existing conventional dentures, 2  months after insertion of new conventional dentures and 2  months after insertion of implant-supported dentures. Thereby, patients responded to questionnaires capturing the oral health impact profile (OHIP) using visual analog scales. Seven domains (functional limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical, psychological and social disability and handicap) were assessed. Higher scores implied poorer patient satisfaction. In addition, the questionnaire involved the evaluation of cleaning ability, general satisfaction, speech, comfort, esthetics, stability, and chewing ability. Higher scores implied higher patient satisfaction. RESULTS Patient satisfaction significantly increased for implant-supported dentures compared with old dentures in all seven OHIP subgroups, as well as for cleaning ability, general satisfaction, ability to speak, comfort, esthetics, and stability (P <  0. 05). The comparison of new conventional dentures and implant-supported dentures revealed a statistically significantly increased satisfaction for functional limitation (difference of 33. 2  mm), psychological discomfort (difference of 36. 7  mm), physical disability (difference of 36. 3  mm), and social disability (difference of 23. 5  mm), (P <  0. 05).

Replicas of the <b>maxillary</b> complete <b>dentures</b> of all the participants were made using scanning resin. The denture replicas were scanned using cone-beam computed tomography, and 3 -dimensional finite-element models were constructed (dentures, mucosa, and jig). The tensile site was located 5 mm anterior from the central point of the denture’s posterior border, and the loading site was located at the central point of the central incisor edge and the right first premolar buccal cusp. The load was 10 N and perpendicular to the occlusal plane. One-way ANOVA was calculated to determine any differences in the maximum principal stress value among the 3 sites. The Games-Howell test for multiple comparisons was applied to determine which sites were different. A Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to determine any correlation between the retention force and maximum principal stress at measurement posterior site, and a Pearson correlation coefficient was used at the central incisor edge and premolar buccal cusp (all α=. 05). Comparative investigations of the association between the maximum principal stress generated and the denture retention force were carried out. ResultsThe stress distribution of the maximum principal stress at each measurement point was similar for each participant. The maximum principal stress at the posterior site measurement was significantly higher than measurements at the incisor edge and posterior buccal cusp (P<. 01). The maximum principal stress the posterior and incisor edge sites were found to be correlated (P<. 05). ConclusionsThis study results suggest that although more factors need to be considered, a 3 -dimensional finite-element analysis may be used to estimate the retention force of <b>maxillary</b> complete <b>dentures...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the effect of a denture {{adhesive}} (DA) on patient satisfaction and kinesiographic parameters of complete denture wearers by a cross-over study. Fifty edentulous patients received a set of new complete dentures. After an adaptation period, the participants were enrolled in the trial and randomized to receive a sequence of treatment protocols: Protocol 1 - DA use during the first 15 days, followed by no DA for the next 15 days; Protocol 2 - no DA during the first 15 days, followed by use of DA for the next 15 days. Outcomes were assessed after 15 days of each sequence of treatment. A questionnaire was used to assess the patients ´ satisfaction. A kinesiograph was used to record mandible movements and patterns of <b>maxillary</b> complete <b>denture</b> movement during chewing. The Wilcoxon test (α= 0. 05) and a paired sample t-test (α= 0. 05) were used to compare satisfaction levels and kinesiographic data, respectively. Use of DA improved the overall level of patient satisfaction (p< 0. 001). The kinesiographic recordings revealed a significant increase (1. 7 mm) in vertical mandible movements (p< 0. 001) during chewing and a lower (0. 3 mm) vertical intrusion of the <b>maxillary</b> complete <b>dentures</b> (p= 0. 002) during chewing after using the DA. Use of DA in complete denture wearers improved the patients ´ satisfaction and altered mandible movements, with increases in vertical movements during chewing and less intrusion of <b>maxillary</b> complete <b>dentures...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{preservation}} of esthetics and occlusal vertical dimension {{is critical in}} patients with existing full-arch tooth-retained fixed prostheses. This clinical report describes the provision of a <b>maxillary</b> immediate complete <b>denture</b> in a patient with a maxillary full-arch fixed dental prosthesis over nonviable teeth. The existing fixed dental prosthesis {{was used in the}} fabrication of the <b>maxillary</b> immediate complete <b>denture</b> to preserve esthetics. The technique involved recording and {{preservation of}} the occlusal vertical dimension and occlusion of the existing prosthesis. The technique is simple, quick, cost-effective and less challenging clinically and technically...|$|R
