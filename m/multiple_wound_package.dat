40|$|Random winding {{is widely}} used for the {{preparation}} of yarn packages used {{in a variety of}} textile processes. Ribboning caused by overwinding of yarn turns at certain places within the package is a basic problem encountered in this process. Standard random winders incorporate some means of ribbon breaking, which strictly speaking have limited effectiveness. The research reported in thesis was undertaken to realise a random winder capable of detecting the occurrence of ribboning, and taking the ribbon breaking action at these precise times, and thereby achieve 'active' ribbon breaking. Such a winder was realised by the addition of suitable transducers to a standard random winder, which could be controlled by a PC. Winding trials carried out using this equipment established the effectiveness of the concept and also the greater freedom from ribboning the method achieved in comparison with other available methods. Unwinding trials carried out by suitably modifying the winder for measuring yarn unwinding tension were also used to establish the effectiveness of active ribbon breaking. Preliminary experiments carried out on the above apparatus showed the possibility of constructing a Angle of Double Traverse (ADT) diagram on the VDU of the PC during winding operations, which could serve as a useful aid to follow the progress of the winding operation. It was very useful for showing the occurrence of major and minor ribboning in the <b>wound</b> <b>package,</b> and also for visually indicating the effectiveness of the ribbon breaking procedures. The diagram was of further use in studying the nature of package driving by the grooved drum. The case of driving a deformable body such as a yarn package on a comparatively non-deformable grooved drum is important for understanding how the package rotates without any obvious slipping. By varying the winding conditions, it was in fact shown that some measurable slip occurs, and these relationships were experimentally established. Computer simulation is useful to determine the stresses within a <b>wound</b> <b>package,</b> particularly as these cannot be measured using conventional techniques. The results of such a simulation carried out on a random <b>wound</b> <b>package</b> and the comparison of the results with those obtained for a precision <b>wound</b> <b>package</b> are also presented...|$|R
30|$|In {{cases of}} {{multiple}} gunshot lesions, we found autopsy {{to be somewhat}} better for detecting external <b>wounds,</b> <b>multiple</b> entry <b>wounds,</b> wound channels, direction of injury, heart lesions with hemopericardium, and lung lacerations, {{all of which are}} directly inspected during autopsy. PMCT does not show the lesions with the same resolution as can be obtained with the naked eye. Lathrop and Nolte (2016) stated that trajectories were more challenging to assess with <b>multiple</b> <b>wounds,</b> with only 44 – 58 % correctly identified due to the difficulty in adequately describing the trajectories, and not advisable to supplant autopsy with PMCT.|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of war wounds {{are caused by}} antipersonnel fragments from munitions such as mortars and bomblets. Modern munitions aim to incapacitate soldiers with <b>multiple</b> <b>wounds</b> from very small fragments of low available kinetic energy. Many of these fragments may be stopped by helmets and body armour and {{this has led to}} a predominance of <b>multiple</b> <b>wounds</b> to limbs in those casualties requiring surgery. The development of an appropriate management strategy for these <b>multiple</b> <b>wounds</b> requires knowledge of the contamination and extent of soft tissue injury; conservative management may be appropriate. The extent of skin and muscle damage associated with a small fragment wound, the way in which these wounds may progress without intervention and their colonisation by bacteria has been determined in an experimental animal model. Results from 12 animals are presented. There was a very small (approximately 1 mm) margin of nonviable skin around the entrance wound. The amount of devitalised muscle in the wound tract was a few hundred milligrams. Some muscles peripheral to the wound track also showed signs of damage 1 h after wounding, but this improved over 24 h; the proportion of fragmented muscle fibres in the tissue around the track decreased as time went on. There was no clinical sign or bacteriological evidence of the track becoming infected up to 24 h after wounding. This preliminary work suggests that, in the absence of infection, the amount of muscle damage caused by small fragment wounds begins to resolve in the first 24 h after injury, even without surgical intervention...|$|R

A task force was organized in July 1980 to probe the Sunday slashings, and Watts was placed under sporadic surveillance; a November court order permitted officers to plant a homing device in his car.|$|R

50|$|Rifles and {{shotguns}} {{are commonly}} used for hunting and often to defend a home or place of business. Usually, large game are hunted with rifles (although shotguns can be used, particularly with slugs), while birds are hunted with shotguns. Shotguns are sometimes preferred for defending a home or business due to their wide impact area, <b>multiple</b> <b>wound</b> tracks (when using buckshot), shorter range, and reduced penetration of walls (when using lighter shot), which significantly reduces the likelihood of unintended harm, although the handgun is also common.|$|R
50|$|The Indochina Media Memorial Foundation (IMMF) {{was founded}} in 1991 by British {{photographer}} Tim Page, who survived <b>multiple</b> <b>wounds</b> while covering the Vietnam War. The foundation {{was set up to}} honor the memory of the more than 320 journalists from all sides who died while covering the conflicts in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia from 1945 to 1975. Its other main aim was to assist colleagues in a region that was emerging from decades of war, poverty and isolation-remembering the dead by helping the living.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, the hit {{potential}} of a defensive shotgun is often overstated. The typical defensive shot is taken at very close ranges, at which the shot charge expands {{no more than a}} few centimeters. [...] This means the shotgun must still be aimed at the target with some care. Balancing this is the fact that shot spreads further upon entering the target, and the <b>multiple</b> <b>wound</b> channels of a defensive load are far more likely to produce a disabling wound than a rifle or handgun.|$|R
40|$|Aims: Osteomyelitis worsens the {{prognosis}} in the diabetic foot, but predisposing factors remain largely undefined, In a prospectively followed cohort we assessed {{risk factors for}} developing osteomyelitis. Methods: We enrolled consecutive persons with diabetes who presented to a managed-care diabetes disease management program. The patients underwent standardized assessments. We monitored for all foot complications, defined infections by criteria consistent with international Working Group guidelines, and defined osteomyelitis as a positive culture from a bone specimen. Results: 1666 persons were enrolled, 50 % male, mean age 69 years. Over a mean of 27. 2 months of follow-up, 151 patients developed foot infections, 30 (19. 9 %) of which involved bone. Independent risk factors for osteomyelitis were: wounds that extended to bone or joint (relative risk [RR] = 23. 1), previous history of a wound prior to enrollment (RR= 2. 2), and recurrent or <b>multiple</b> <b>wounds</b> {{during the study period}} (RR = 1. 9). Conclusions: In this study population, managed in a specialized diabetic foot care center, the results suggest that independent risk factors for developing osteomyelitis are deep, recurrent and <b>multiple</b> <b>wounds.</b> These results may help clinicians target their efforts at diagnosing foot osteomyelitis to the highest risk patients.
