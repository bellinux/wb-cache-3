40|$|The {{behavior}} of a ferromagnetic core is analyzed, when the windings (wound on the core) are contemporarily fed by a sinusoidal voltage and a direct current. After the theoretical analysis of the problem, an analytical/ numerical study is carried out on a mono-phase transformer, using a simple circuital model, which takes into account iron non linearity; two typical cases are considered, of a mono-phase transformer which feeds <b>a</b> <b>converter</b> (<b>d.</b> c. current is in secondary winding) and of a transformer fed by <b>a</b> <b>converter</b> (<b>d.</b> c. current in primary winding). Finally, some suggestions are given about two design features, very important in presence of <b>a</b> <b>d.</b> c. component: the use of additional air gap and, for a three phase transformer, the type of winding connection (wye or delta) ...|$|R

50|$|The CDI was {{designed}} to interpret a signal from a VOR, LDA, or ILS receiver. These receivers output a signal composed of two AC voltages. When used with <b>a</b> VOR, <b>a</b> <b>converter</b> decodes this signal, and, by determining the desired heading or radial from a resolver connected to the OBS knob, provides a 150mV control signal to drive the CDI needle left or right. Most older units and some newer ones integrate <b>a</b> <b>converter</b> with the CDI. CDI units with <b>an</b> internal <b>converter</b> are not compatible with GPS units. More modern units are driven by <b>a</b> <b>converter</b> that is standalone or integrated with the radio. The resolver position {{is sent to the}} converter which outputs the control signal to drive the CDI. For digital units, the desired position of the needle is transmitted via a serial ARINC 429 signal from the radio or GPS unit, allowing the CDI design to be independent of the receiver and by multiple receiver types.|$|R
