The noisy pixel is replaced by <b>modified</b> winsorized <b>mean</b> of the unsymmetrical trimmed array. The non noisy pixel is left unaltered. The proposed algorithm eliminates the salt and pepper noise by preserving fine details of an image even at high noise densities. The proposed algorithm shows excellent results quantitatively and qualitatively when compared to existing and recently filters. The proposed algorithm is tested against different images of varying details, which gives higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Image Enhancement Factor (IEF), Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM) and low Mean square error(MSE). The information preserving capability is evaluated using Pratt's FOM, which yielded very good result even at high noise densities.

40|$|The use of eddy flux of {{thickness}} between density surfaces {{has become}} a familiar starting point in oceanographic studies of adiabatic eddy effects on the mean density distribution. In this study, a dynamical analogy with the density thickness flux approach is explored to reexamine the theory of nonzonal wave–mean flow interaction in two-dimensional horizontal flows. By analogy with the density thickness flux, the flux of thickness between potential vorticity (PV) surfaces {{is used as a}} starting point for a residual circulation formulation for nonzonal mean flows. Mean equations for barotropic PV dynamics are derived in which a <b>modified</b> <b>mean</b> velocity with an eddy-induced component advects a <b>modified</b> <b>mean</b> PV that also has an eddy-induced component. For smallamplitude eddies, the results are analogous to recent results of McDougall and McIntosh derived for stratified flow. The dynamical implications of this approach are then examined. The <b>modified</b> <b>mean</b> PV equation provides a decomposition of the eddy forcing of the mean flow into contributions from wave transience, wave dissipation, and wave-induced mass redistribution between PV contours. If the mean flow is along the mean PV contours, the contribution from wave-induced mass redistribution is ‘‘workless’ ’ in Plumb’s sense that it is equivalent to an eddy-induced stress that is perpendicular to the mean flow. This contribution is also associated with the convergence along the mean streamlines of a modified PV flux that is equal to the difference between the PV flux and the rotational PV flux term identified by Illari and Marshall. The cross-stream component of the modified PV flux is related to wave transience and dissipation. 1...|$|E

40|$|Intrusion {{detection}} systems (IDS) have a {{vital role}} in protecting computer networks and information systems. In this thesis we applied an SPC monitoring concept to a certain type of traffic data in order to detect a network intrusion. We developed a general SPC intrusion detection approach and described it and the source and the preparation of data used in this thesis. We extracted sample data sets that represent various situations, calculated event intensities for each situation, and stored these sample data sets in the data repository for use in future research. A regular batch mean chart was used to remove the sample datas inherent 60 -second cycles. However, this proved too slow in detecting a signal because the regular batch mean chart only monitored the statistic {{at the end of the}} batch. To gain faster results, a <b>modified</b> batch <b>mean</b> (MBM) chart was developed that met this goal. Subsequently, we developed the <b>Modified</b> Batch <b>Mean</b> Shewhart chart, the <b>Modified</b> Batch <b>Mean</b> Cusum chart, and the <b>Modified</b> Batch <b>Mean</b> EWMA chart and analyzed the performances of each one on simulated data. The simulation studies showed that the MBM charts perform especially well with large signals ?the type of signal typically associated with a DOS intrusion. The MBM Charts can be applied two ways: by using actual control limits or by using robust control limits. The actual control limits must be determined by simulation, but the robust control limits require nothing more than the use of the recommended limits. The robust MBM Shewhart chart was developed based on choosing appropriate values based on batch size. The robust MBM Cusum chart and robust MBM EWMA chart were developed on choosing appropriate values of charting parameters. Ph. D.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the implications for}} eddy parameterisations of expressing {{them in terms of}} the quasi-Stokes velocity. Another definition of low-passed time averaged mean density (the <b>modified</b> <b>mean)</b> must be used, which is the inversion of the mean depth of a given isopycnal. This definition naturally yields lighter (denser) fluid at the surface (floor) than the Eulerian mean, since fluid with these densities occasionally occurs at these locations. The difference between the two means is second-order in perturbation amplitude, and so small, in the fluid interior (where formulae to connect the two exist). Near horizontal boundaries, the differences become first order, and so more severe. Existing formulae for quasi-Stokes velocities and streamfunction also break down here. It is shown that the low-passed time mean potential energy in a closed box is incorrectly computed from <b>modified</b> <b>mean</b> density, the error term involving averaged quadratic variability. The layer in which the largest differences occur between the two mean densities is the vertical excursion of a mean isopycnal across a deformation radius, at most about 20 m thick. Most climate models would have difficulty in resolving such a layer. We show here that extant parameterisations appear to reproduce the Eulerian, and not <b>modified</b> <b>mean,</b> density field and so do not yield a narrow layer at surface and floor either. Both these features make the quasi-Stokes streamfunction appear to be non-zero right up to rigid boundaries. It is thus unclear whether more accurate results would be obtained by leaving the streamfunction non-zero on the boundary – which is smooth and resolvable – or by permitting a delta-function in the horizontal quasi-Stokes velocity by forcing the streamfunction to become zero exactly at the boundary (which it formally must be), but at the cost of small and unresolvable features in the solution. This paper then uses linear stability theory and diagnosed values from eddy-resolving models, to ask the question: if climate models cannot or do not resolve the difference between Eulerian and <b>modified</b> <b>mean</b> density, what are the relevant surface and floor quasi-Stokes streamfunction conditions, and what are their effects on the density fields? The linear Eady problem is used as a special case to investigate this, since terms can be explicitly computed. A variety of eddy parameterisations is employed for a channel problem, and the time-mean density is compared with that from an eddy-resolving calculation. Curiously, although most of the parameterisations employed are formally valid only in terms of the modified density, they all reproduce only the Eulerian mean density successfully. This is despite the existence of (numerical) delta-functions near the surface. The parameterisations were only successful if the vertical component of the quasi-Stokes velocity was required to vanish at top and bottom. A simple parameterisation of Eulerian density fluxes was, however, just as accurate and avoids delta-function behaviour completely...|$|E
