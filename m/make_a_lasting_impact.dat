A financial scandal resulted in the Football Association suspending Maley and seventeen players in 1906, leaving Harry Newbould with the task of assembling a makeshift side at short notice. In 1912 Ernest Mangnall joined City from local rivals Manchester United, but was unable to replicate the success he had enjoyed with the Reds. Upon Mangnall's departure in 1924 the roles of secretary and manager were separated, with David Ashworth appointed manager and Wilf Wild as secretary. This arrangement continued during Peter Hodge's time as manager, though the roles merged again when Wild became manager in 1932. Wild became the club's longest serving manager, winning the FA Cup and League Championship during his fourteen-year tenure. By the time Sam Cowan replaced Wild the roles of secretary and manager were separated permanently. Cowan lasted only one season, and was replaced by Jock Thomson. He gained promotion, but did not <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>lasting</b> <b>impact</b> at the top level.|$|E

40|$|Wearable {{computing}} {{applications are}} becoming increasingly present in our lives. Of the many wearable computing applications, wearable health monitoring may have the most potential to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>lasting</b> positive <b>impact.</b> The ability to remotely monitor physiological signals such as respiration, motion, and temperature has benefits for populations such as elderly citizens, fitness professionals, and soldiers in the battlefield. To fully integrate wearable networks into a user's daily life, these systems must be minimally invasive and minimally intrusive. At the same time, such wearable networks require multiple sensors and electronic components to be mounted on the body. Unfortunately, typical off-the-shelf components of this nature are heavy, bulky, and don't integrate well with the human form. Thus, {{it is critical to}} figure out how best to minimize the physical and mental burden that these systems place on the user. To address these problems, we propose a new method of designing wearable health monitoring networks by combining electrically conductive fabrics and power-line communication technology. Electrically conductive fabrics are useful in that they feel and behave like normally worn clothing but also have the ability to transmit data and power. (cont.) To fully exploit the conductive fabric as a transmission medium, we also use power-line communication technology. Power-line communication allows for simultaneous power and data transmission over a shared medium. The use of these two technologies will allow us to significantly reduce the amount of metal cabling on the body and to reduce overall system bulk and weight. With this project, we design the DC-PLC system that will act as the physical layer of the architecture. Next, we construct a prototype body area network, and derive analytical models for predicting garment electrostatic and electro-dynamic properties using Maxwell's equations, and verify using empirical data and finite-element analysis. Finally, we will determine relevant rules and guidelines for the design and construction of such garments. by Eric R. Wade. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|In this week’s podcast, Kevin Cahill, Executive Director of The W. Edwards Deming Institute® and David Langford, CEO of Langford Learning, Inc., {{introduce}} The Deming in Education Initiative. Kevin and David share how The Deming in Education Initiative was conceived, {{the impact}} of the Deming Philosophy on education, and where the Initiative is going in the future. The initiative first began many years ago when David joined the Deming Institute Advisory Board to help with their efforts to apply the Deming philosophy in education. But the roots of Deming in Education go even further back. As David explains, improving education was “a great love” of Dr. Deming, as an educator who taught at NY University for 40 years. Many of Dr. Deming’s theories and teachings are directly focused on the education system. After working with Dr. Deming from 1986 to 1993, David began implementing the concepts in his own education system, finding that students easily took to the new approach. Over the last 25 years, David has seen the Deming teachings <b>make</b> <b>a</b> profound and <b>lasting</b> <b>impact</b> on improving school culture and the learning process in the US and around the world. It is the only philosophy that improves all aspects of the education system. That impact has inspired Kevin, David and The Deming Institute to commit a deeper focus on developing a long term, sustainable, systems approach to improving education for all students, through The Deming in Education Initiative.

40|$|The {{conversion}} efficiency of a solar panel {{is the most}} important lever in the cost of electricity it produces. For photovoltaics to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> significant and <b>lasting</b> <b>impact</b> as <b>a</b> renewable energy resource, the electricity costs have to decrease, and the {{conversion efficiency}} therefore has to increase. The field of nanophotonics aims to understand and manipulate the interaction of light and matter at the nanoscale. Since this interaction {{is at the heart of}} the photovoltaic energy conversion process, it is only natural that nanophotonics can play an important role in achieving high efficiencies. This thesis brings together experimental and theoretical contributions aimed at deepening the understanding of how nanophotonics can enhance photovoltaic conversion efficiencies. In particular, we focus on the photovoltage that a nanoscale solar cell can generate, both in the ideal case and with practical limitations. We study a number of nanophotonic mechanisms that can enhance the efficiency of a photovoltaic device: spectrum splitting, metal-semiconductor core-shell nanowires, directivity in absorption, and escape probability enhancements. We also present a new experimental technique to measure quantitatively the absorption cross section of a single nanostructure. Using our new experimental technique, we characterize the limits and performance losses of a nanoscale photovoltaic device in detail. Overall, this thesis provides new fundamental insights into nanoscale photovoltaics. Our findings strengthen the role of nanophotonics in photovoltaics, and may also be applied in other optoelectronic devices such as light emitting diodes...|$|R
40|$|Recent government-backed {{programs}} such as Race to the Top and No Child Left Behind have increased competition in schools {{in an effort to}} improve student and teacher performance. However, these programs have not had as drastic an impact as many had hoped, and the United States continues to toil {{in the middle of the}} pack educationally when compared with the rest of the world. As many students have continued to struggle in school, many different ideas have been introduced into different levels of the education system in an attempt to raise scores and boost performance. One such idea is competency-based education (CBE), which is an alternative to the traditional time-based system of public education. Rather than receiving a diploma for completing four years of high school, CBE focuses on individualization for students. Semester-long and year-long classes are replaced with a list of competencies in which students must demonstrate mastery in order to earn their diplomas. As with any other educational concept, there is just as much criticism toward CBE as there is praise. Through a literature review, I aim to describe the benefits and drawbacks of the CBE system. I lay out the advantages CBE has that the current education system lacks while simultaneously pointing out potential flaws. In addition, student and teacher survey results from a local high school are analyzed to help determine the pros and cons of the current education system. The analysis aims to overview both students 2 ̆ 7 and teachers 2 ̆ 7 receptiveness to a possible shift toward CBE.

40|$|Many voices {{over the}} last decade have called for reform in special {{education}} in American public schools. As the number of those receiving services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”) has grown, scholars and pundits have increasingly argued that the system not only is failing {{to meet the needs of}} many children with disabilities, but in some cases is actively causing harm to those it is intended to serve. Over the <b>last</b> several years, <b>an</b> increasing number of state legislatures have proposed or have passed laws that give children with disabilities public money to attend a private school. Rather than trying to fix the perceived deficiencies within the existing system, these states instead facilitate the exit of unhappy parents and students from public schools altogether.
