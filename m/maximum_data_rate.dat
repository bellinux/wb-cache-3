40|$|Routing, {{subchannel}} scheduling, {{and power}} allocation are generally treated as separate problems in relay-enhanced OFDMA-based cellular networks. They are mostly modeled using non-linear constraints to maximize either sum rate or minimum rate. Although separation of problems simplifies modeling, {{it can lead}} to suboptimal solutions which can degrades network efficiency (i. e., low sum rate or low minimum rate). Also, models that include non-linear constraints generally belong to the NP-hard class. In this study, we jointly optimize routing, subchannel scheduling, and power allocation in relay-enhanced OFDMA-based cellular networks through a novel Linear Programming (LP) framework employing discrete power levels. Our framework is comprised of LP models for the following problems: Sum Rate Maximization (SRM), Max-Min Fairness (MMF), and Joint Sum Rate Maximization and Max-Min Fairness (JSRM 3 F). We investigate the trade-offs in sum rate maximization and max-min fairness in terms of achievable <b>maximum</b> <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> and subchannel sharing by numerical evaluations of the LP models. We show that <b>maximum</b> <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> obtained with discrete power allocation are near-optimal even with a few discrete power levels. We provide upper bounds for joint maximization of sum rate and minimum rate. Furthermore, {{the results of this study}} reveal that fairness has a significant impact on subchannel sharing...|$|R
