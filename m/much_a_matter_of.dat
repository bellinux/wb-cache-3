5|$|The vitriolic {{campaign}} of Richard Wagner against Meyerbeer {{was to a}} great extent responsible for the decline of Meyerbeer's popularity after his death in 1864. This campaign was as <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> personal spite as of racism – Wagner had learnt a great deal from Meyerbeer and indeed Wagner's early opera Rienzi (1842) was facetiously called by Hans von Bülow 'Meyerbeer's best opera'. Meyerbeer supported the young Wagner, both financially and in helping to obtain the premiere productions of both Rienzi and The Flying Dutchman at Dresden.|$|E

25|$|Scrapple is {{typically}} made of hog offal, {{such as the}} head, heart, liver, and other trimmings, which are boiled with any bones attached (often the entire head), to make a broth. Once cooked, bones and fat are removed, the meat is reserved, and (dry) cornmeal is boiled in the broth to make a mush. The meat, finely minced, is returned to the pot and seasonings, typically sage, thyme, savory, black pepper, and others are added. The mush is formed into loaves and allowed to cool thoroughly until set. The proportions and seasoning are very <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> {{the region and the}} cook's taste.|$|E

500|$|Other {{nightjar}} species {{occur in}} parts of the breeding and wintering ranges. The red-necked nightjar breeds in Iberia and northwest Africa; it is larger, greyer and longer winged than the European nightjar, and has a broad buff collar and more conspicuous white markings on the wings and tail. Wintering European nightjars in Africa may overlap with the related rufous-cheeked and sombre nightjars. Both have a more prominent buff hind-neck collar and more spotting on the wing coverts. The sombre nightjar is also much darker than its European cousin. Given their nocturnal habits, cryptic plumage and difficulty of observation, nightjar observation [...] "is as <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> fortune as effort or knowledge".|$|E
500|$|In his 1936 speech when {{presented}} with the RIBA's Royal Gold Medal, Holden defined his position: [...] "It was not so <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> creating a new style, as of discarding those incrustations which counted for style... surface embroidery empty of structural significance". His method was to focus on [...] "those more permanent basic factors of architecture, the plan, and the planes and masses arising out of the plan." [...] He described his ideal building as one [...] "which takes naturally and inevitably the form controlled by the plan and the purpose and the materials. A building which provides opportunities for the exercise and skill and pleasure in work {{not only to the}} designer but also for the many craftsmen employed and the occupants of the building." ...|$|E
500|$|From infancy Robert Dudley {{grew up as}} a Protestant. Presumably {{conforming}} {{in public}} under Mary Tudor, he was counted among the [...] "heretics" [...] by Philip II's agent before Elizabeth's accession. He immediately became a major patron to former Edwardian clerics and returning exiles. Meanwhile, he also helped some of Mary's former servants and maintained Catholic contacts. From 1561 he advocated and supported the Huguenot cause, and the French ambassador described him as [...] "totally of the Calvinist religion" [...] in 1568. After the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572 this trait in him became more pronounced, and he continued as the chief patron of English Puritans and a champion of international Calvinism. On the other hand, in his household, Leicester employed Catholics like Sir Christopher Blount, who held a position of trust and of whom he was personally fond. The Earl's patronage of and reliance on individuals was as <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> old family loyalties or personal relationships as of religious allegiances.|$|E

40|$|From {{the point}} at which a learner commits to {{undertaking}} a course of study, and conceivably some time before, that learner holds an intention to study. This paper offers a theory which explains how that intention to study is strengthened or weakened as a course of study progresses. It suggests that it is <b>much</b> less <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> learners deciding to persist with or depart from a course of study and <b>much</b> more <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> continuing upon <b>a</b> course of action embarked upon – of maintaining an intention – by its temporal integration into the structure of their daily lives. The theory of temporal integration explains the process enabling learners to engage in the learning experience and how for some students, the intention to learn is weakened {{to the extent that they}} leave the course, most often by default...|$|R

It argues that Ellis’ work on female sexual inversion was <b>much</b> less <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> stigmatising lesbians, than of negotiating specific medical debates about sex, and sexual inverts and women’s role in society...|$|R
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from September 24, 1910. It states: [...] "Life in a country town is often tedious and tiresome, and {{were it not for}} the little dinners and teas the townsfolk are constantly given, existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed. So the time honored get-togethers of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar; they are just as <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> necessity and as such have come to stay. The Gales thought well of this established feature. They made it a joyous occasion for themselves as well as their guests. They were hardly an overly wealthy family, and their table was never notable for an oversupply of the good things of life, but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time." ...|$|E
500|$|Jerry Coyne, {{writing in}} Nature, {{described}} {{the book as}} for the interested lay reader, and called it [...] "a paean to recent advances in developmental genetics, and what they may {{tell us about the}} evolutionary process." [...] For him, the centrepiece was [...] "the unexpected discovery that the genes that control the body plans of all bilateral animals, including worms, insects, frogs and humans, are largely identical. These are the 'homeobox' (Hox) genes". He called Carroll a leader in the field and an [...] "adept communicator", but admits to [...] "feeling uncomfortable" [...] when Carroll sets out his personal vision of the field [...] "without admitting that large parts of that vision remain controversial." [...] Coyne pointed out that the idea that the [...] "'regulatory gene' is the locus of evolution" [...] dates back to Roy Britten and colleagues around 1970, but was still weakly supported by observation or experiment. He granted that chimps and humans are almost 99% identical at DNA level, but points out that [...] "humans and chimps have different amino-acid sequences in at least 55% of their proteins, a figure that rises to 95% for humans and mice. Thus we can't exclude protein-sequence evolution as an important reason why we lack whiskers and tails." [...] He also noted that nearly half of human protein-coding genes do not have homologues in fruit flies, so one could argue the opposite of Carroll's thesis and claim that [...] "evolution of form is very <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> teaching old genes to make new genes." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{children}} of the Russian exiles often married Han Chinese, and the resulting children were always known in Manchukuo as [...] "mixed water" [...] people, who were shunned by both the Russian and Chinese communities. Chinese accounts, both {{at the time and}} later, tended to portray the Russians living in Manchuria as all prostitutes and thieves, and almost always ignored the contributions made by middle-class Russians to community life. Mindful of the way that Americans and most Europeans enjoyed extraterritorial rights in China at the time, accounts in Chinese literature about the Russians living in Manchukuo and their [...] "mixed water" [...] {{children of}}ten display a certain schadenfreude recounting how the Russians in Manchukuo usually lived in poverty on the margins of Manchukuo society with the local Chinese more economically successful. The South Korean historian Bong Inyoung noted when it came to writing about the [...] "mixed water" [...] people, Chinese writers tended to treat them as not entirely Chinese, {{but on the other hand}} were willing to accept these people as Chinese provided that would totally embrace Chinese culture by renouncing their Russian heritage, thus making Chineseness as <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> culture as of race.|$|E

60|$|Leland {{closed his}} lips a little tighter, {{for it was}} borne in upon him that Jimmy Denham had not spoken without a purpose, and he {{realised}} {{that he might be}} listened to if he craved permission to offer himself as a suitor for his sister's hand. Jimmy, however, was too adroit to dwell upon the subject, and, changing it abruptly, led Leland into a discussion of hammerless guns. Still, both he and Eveline Annersly realised that he had said enough, which in most cases is a good deal better than too <b>much.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> fact, his words had stirred Leland to the rashest plunge he had ever made in his life, though during most of it he had usually taken the boldest course, holding his wheat on a falling market and sowing in times of black depression when the prudent held their hand.|$|R

5000|$|Tariffs {{were the}} main source of revenue for the federal {{government}} from 1789 to 1914.

Whigs and Republicans favored higher tariffs to protect and encourage American industry and industrial workers. Since the early 20th century, however, U.S. tariffs have been very low and have been <b>much</b> less <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> partisan debate.|$|R
