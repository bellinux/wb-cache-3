5|$|In 2005, radar data {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} large quantities of water ice at the poles and at mid-latitudes. The Mars rover Spirit sampled chemical compounds containing water molecules in March 2007. The Phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow Martian soil on July 31, 2008. On September 28, 2015, NASA announced the presence of briny flowing salt water on the <b>Martian</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{proposed}} that carbonate globules found in meteorite ALH84001, which {{is thought to have}} originated from Mars, could be fossilized microbes extant on Mars when the meteorite was blasted from the <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> by a meteor strike some 15 million years ago. This proposal has been met with skepticism, and an exclusively inorganic origin for the shapes has been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Mars is {{approximately}} half {{the diameter of}} Earth with a surface area only slightly less than the total area of Earth's dry land. Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange appearance of the <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> is caused by iron(III) oxide, or rust. It can look like butterscotch; other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on the minerals present.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{ideas have}} been {{advanced}} {{to explain the}} streaks. Some involve water, or even the growth of organisms. [...] The generally accepted explanation for the streaks {{is that they are}} formed from the avalanching of a thin layer of bright dust that is covering a darker surface. Bright dust settles on all <b>Martian</b> <b>surfaces</b> after a period of time.|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{effects on}} {{essential}} {{systems and processes}} necessary to provide a viable environment for {{living and working in}} Space for extended durations will affect the way in which such systems are designed and implemented. The effects of reduced gravity environment of a spacecraft in planetary orbit or in transit, the absence of an atmosphere on the Moon, the dusty lunar and <b>Martian</b> <b>surfaces</b> and their topography, or large temperature shifts between day and night on planetary surfaces, will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{is made of}} the consequences of the interaction of high-voltage spacecraft systems designed for use in orbit or on the lunar and <b>Martian</b> <b>surfaces</b> with such environmental components as electrically charged dust, low pressure atmospheres, ionospheric plasmas and neutral gas species, and chemically reactive species. An account is given of plausible means for obtaining the requisite data and developing priorities for the study of each of the identified interactions. Attention is given to the computational tools whose development is required for the simulation and quantification of risk factors for the various likely interactions...|$|R
5|$|The current {{understanding}} of planetary habitability—the {{ability of a}} world to develop environmental conditions favorable {{to the emergence of}} life—favors planets that have liquid water on their surface. Most often this requires the orbit of a planet to lie within the habitable zone, which for the Sun extends from just beyond Venus to about the semi-major axis of Mars. During perihelion, Mars dips inside this region, but Mars's thin (low-pressure) atmosphere prevents liquid water from existing over large regions for extended periods. The past flow of liquid water demonstrates the planet's potential for habitability. Recent evidence has suggested that any water on the <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> may have been too salty and acidic to support regular terrestrial life.|$|E
5|$|Using {{data from}} Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, {{scientists}} have found widespread deposits of chloride minerals. Evidence suggests that the deposits were formed from the evaporation of mineral enriched waters. The research suggests that lakes may have been scattered over {{large areas of the}} <b>Martian</b> <b>surface.</b> Usually chlorides are the last minerals to come out of solution. Carbonates, sulfates, and silica should precipitate out ahead of them. Sulfates and silica have been found by the Mars Rovers on the surface. Places with chloride minerals may have once held various life forms. Furthermore, such areas could preserve traces of ancient life.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when the}} marine {{catches up with}} Campbell in the central {{computer}} processing sector of the base, Campbell is mortally wounded and only has enough strength to say that Kelly has taken Campbell's BFG 9000 weapon before expiring. Kelly then begins to taunt the marine in a demonic voice. The marine eventually faces off with Kelly in the central computer core, revealing Kelly as a cybernetic human grafted onto a tank-like base. The marine is able to kill Kelly and takes the BFG 9000 before proceeding deeper under the <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> to Site 3, the archaeological dig site where the Soul Cube was unearthed. At the primary excavation site, the marine discovers the Hellmouth, defended by Hell's mightiest warrior, the Cyberdemon. Using the Soul Cube, the marine defeats the Cyberdemon in combat, and the Soul Cube then seals the Hellmouth. The ending cut scene shows the reinforcements from Earth arriving at the base to discover the carnage. They find the marine alive, but discover that Swann has died. They are, however, unable to locate Betruger, who in the final scene is shown in Hell, reincarnated as a dragon-like demon.|$|E
40|$|Basic design {{reference}} requirements {{pertinent to}} EVA equipment on lunar and <b>martian</b> <b>surfaces</b> are provided. Environmental factors affecting surface EVA are analyzed including gravity, dust, atmospheric conditions, thermal gradients, lightning conditions, and radiation effects, and activities associated with surface EVA are outlined. Environmental and activity effects on EVA equipment are assessed, and {{emphasis is placed}} on planetary surface portable life support systems (PLSS), suit development, protection from micrometeoroids, dust, and radiation, food and water supplies, and the extravehicular mobility-unit thermal-control system. Environmental and activity impacts on PLSS design are studied, with focus on base self-sufficiency and reduction in resupply logistics...|$|R
40|$|Consideration {{is given}} to the {{relations}} between the physical properties of the surface materials at Viking landing sites, the physical properties of other <b>Martian</b> <b>surfaces</b> inferred from radar observations from earth and thermal observations from orbit, and the geological processes that formed the materials and shaped the surfaces. The radar and thermal remote-sensing signatures of the landing site surface materials are estimated and compared with the thermal and radar measurements for the entire planet. It is shown that the surface materials at the landing sites are good analogs for the materials in most of the Martian equatorial regions...|$|R
30|$|Note {{that with}} an {{estimated}} age of 1  Gy as reported by Quantin et al. (2004 b), Melas Chasma {{would be the most}} ancient of the three landslides, while Coprates Labes and Ophir Labes would date to 400 and 150  My, respectively. However, because the CTX and HRSC imagery indicates that Coprates Labes has run on top of the landslide deposit of Ophir Labes, it must be more recent. We deduce that, although dating with crater counting has provided fundamental clues on the age of <b>Martian</b> <b>surfaces</b> (Neukum et al. 2001), the application to small surfaces may be problematic and should be taken with care (e.g., Kerr 2006).|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of reduced gravitational forces (in space {{and on the}} lunar or <b>Martian</b> <b>surfaces)</b> on manufacturing processes must be understood for effective fabrication and repair of structures and replacement parts during long duration space missions. The electron beam freeform fabrication (EBF 3) process uses an electron beam and wire to fabricate metallic structures. The process efficiencies of the electron beam and the solid wire feedstock make the EBF 3 process attractive for use in-space. This paper will describe the suitability of the EBF 3 process in the space environment and will highlight preliminary testing of the EBF 3 process in a zero-gravity environment...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} an automated system for cataloging impact craters using the MOLA 128 pixels/degree {{digital elevation model}} of Mars. Craters are detected by a two-step algorithm that first identifies round and symmetric topographic depressions as crater candidates and then selects craters using a machine-learning technique. The system is robust with respect to surface types; craters are identified with similar accuracy from all different types of <b>martian</b> <b>surfaces</b> without adjusting input parameters. By using a large training set in its final selection step, the system produces virtually no false detections. Finally, the system provides a seamless integration of crater detection with its characterization. Of particular interest {{is the ability of}} our algorithm to calculate crater depths. The system is described and its application is demonstrated on eight large sites representing all major types of <b>martian</b> <b>surfaces.</b> An evaluation of its performance and prospects for its utilization for global surveys are given by means of detailed comparison of obtained results to the manually-derived Catalog of Large Martian Impact Craters. We use the results from the test sites to construct local depth–diameter relationships based on a large number of craters. In general, obtained relationships are in agreement with what was inferred on the basis of manual measurements. However, we have found that, in Terra Cimmeria, the depth/diameter ratio has an abrupt decrease at 38 °S regardless of crater size. If shallowing of craters is attributed to presence of sub-surface ice, a sudden change in its spatial distribution is suggested by our findings. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{word space}} in space {{architecture}} {{is referring to}} the outer space definition, which is from English outer and space. Outer {{can be defined as}} [...] "situated on or toward the outside; external; exterior" [...] and originated around 1350-1400 in Middle English. [...] Space is [...] "an area, extent, expanse, lapse of time," [...] the aphetic of Old French espace dating to 1300. Espace is from Latin spatium, [...] "room, area, distance, stretch of time," [...] and is of uncertain origin. [...] In space architecture, speaking of outer space usually means the region of the universe outside Earth's atmosphere, as opposed to outside the atmospheres of all terrestrial bodies. This allows the term to include such domains as the lunar and <b>Martian</b> <b>surfaces.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Martian terrains are {{represented}} {{as a series of}} drainage basins, regardless of the historical presence or absence of actual fluid flow. A statistical analysis of each drainage network, computationally extracted from an underlying topography based on the MOLA data, yields a network descriptor, a compact, numerical characterization of a network. These descriptors are used to compare different <b>martian</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Altogether, 386 drainage networks, representing all major epochs and geological units, were extracted and analyzed. We have found that our approach can distinguish morphologically different terrains, but only in a statistical sense. In particular, the method could be used to measure the degree of surface cratering and thus the age of the surface. In addition, for surfaces that are not heavily cratered the method is capable of distinguishing between different geological units...|$|R
40|$|Future {{targeted}} exploration {{missions to}} the lunar or <b>Martian</b> <b>surfaces</b> will need an intelligent landing sensor {{system that can}} detect hazards and guide the lander to a safe site identified during the descent. Lidar-based approaches enjoy many advantages over competing hazard detection technologies, such as active illumination and high spatial resolution. A technical overview of the Lidar-based Autonomous Planetary landing System (LAPS) operational concept and design reference mission is provided. The effects of motion on the imaging capabilities of the sensor, and the consequent need for compensation, are detailed. Recent full-scale static tests using the ALHAT target at NASA Langley {{have been used to}} validate the imaging performance model of the lidar sensor. Based on the validated model, the flight baseline should be able to resolve features down to 2 cm depth and 12 cm width. 1...|$|R
40|$|A radar-echo {{model for}} Mars based on 12. 6 continuous-wave radio {{transmissions}} backscattered {{from the planet}} is developed. Mars' surface is divided into radar map units {{that are based on}} generalized geologic map units, and the radar map units are further subdivided using thermal inertias because the geologic units are insufficient to account for the quasi-specular echoes. The most important of the model's 118 radar-scattering units are characterized. Analyses of the observations and the model show that {{there are at least two}} populations of <b>martian</b> <b>surfaces</b> with distinct radar properties: the cratered uplands and northern low plains, and volcanoes and fields of lava flows. It is concluded that there are two dominant populations of surfaces that have distinct echo properties and that there is general agreement between the quasi-specular echo reflectivities of the present model and those of many other radar observations of Mars...|$|R
25|$|On 4 March 2015, the ISRO {{reported}} that MOM's methane sensors were functioning normally and are studying Mars' albedo, the reflectivity of the planet's surface. The Mars Colour Camera was also returning new {{images of the}} <b>Martian</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of canal-like features was definitively disproved in the 1960s by NASA's Mariner missions. Mariner 4, 6, and 7, and the Mariner 9 orbiter (1972), did not capture images of canals but instead showed a cratered <b>Martian</b> <b>surface.</b> Today, the surface markings {{taken to be}} canals are regarded as an optical illusion.|$|E
40|$|A {{synthesis}} of a diverse suite of observations of H 2 O-related landforms that are possible Mars analogs from terrestrial polar regions (Devon Island in the Arctic; the Dry Valleys of Antarctica) {{put into question}} any requirement for extended episode(s) of warm and wet climate in Mars past. Geologically transient episodes of localized H 2 O cycling, forced by exogenic impacts, enhanced endogenic heat flow, and/or orbit-driven short-term local environmental change under an otherwise cold, low pressure (= 10 (exp 2) mbar) global climate, may be sufficient {{to account for the}} <b>martian</b> <b>surface's</b> exposed record of aqueous activity. A Mars that was only sometimes locally warm and wet while remaining climatically cold throughout its history is consistent with results (difficulties) encountered in modeling efforts attempting to support warm martian climate hypotheses. Possible analogs from terrestrial cold climate regions for the recent gully features on Mars also illustrate how transient localized aqueous activity might, under specific circumstances, also occur on Mars under the present frigid global climatic regime...|$|R
40|$|A {{time series}} of {{calibrated}} bolometric albedo maps of Mars is presented which establish accurate values of surface bolometric albedo and demonstrate {{changes in the}} bolometric appearance of specific regions with time of year and atmospheric conditions. The maps were constructed from Viking infrared thermal mapping data and provide global coverage at latitudes between - 60 and + 60 deg at 1 x 1 deg spatial resolution for a period spanning a Martian year and including the global dust storms of 1977. During dust-free periods, the bolometric albedo maps {{are found to be}} similar to classical earth-based visual albedo maps. A distinctly bimodal distribution of bolometric surface albedos is obtained even during the dust storms, with typical Lambert albedos of 0. 27 and 0. 16 for the bright and dark <b>Martian</b> <b>surfaces,</b> respectively. Atmospheric effects including dust storms are found to influence strongly apparent surface albedos, especially for dark areas, while neither bright nor dark regions show measurable long-term variations of bolometric albedo during clear periods...|$|R
50|$|For many years, various {{scientists}} {{have suggested that}} some <b>Martian</b> <b>surfaces</b> look like periglacial regions on Earth. By analogy with these terrestrial features, {{it has been argued}} for many years that these are regions of permafrost. This would suggest that frozen water lies right beneath the surface. A common feature in the higher latitudes, patterned ground, can occur in a number of shapes, including stripes and polygons. On the Earth, these shapes are caused by the freezing and thawing of soil. There are other types of evidence for large amounts of frozen water under the surface of Mars, such as terrain softening, which rounds sharp topographical features. Theoretical calculations and analysis have tended to bear out the possibility that these are features are formed by the effects of ground ice. Evidence from Mars Odyssey's Gamma Ray Spectrometer and direct measurements with the Phoenix lander have corroborated that many of these features are intimately associated with the presence of ground ice.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} meteorites {{thought to have}} {{originated}} from Mars have been catalogued from around the world, including the Nakhlites.

25|$|Much of the <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> {{is deeply}} covered by dust {{as fine as}} talcum powder. The global {{predominance}} of dust obscures the underlying bedrock, making spectroscopic identification of primary minerals impossible from orbit over {{many areas of the}} planet. The red/orange appearance of the dust is caused by iron(III) oxide (nanophase Fe2O3) and the iron(III) oxide-hydroxide mineral goethite.|$|E

40|$|High voltage systems {{designed}} for use on the lunar and <b>Martian</b> <b>surfaces</b> or in orbit will interact with environmental components such as electrically charged dust, low pressure atmospheres, ionospheric plasmas and neutrals, and chemically reactive species. As the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI) advances {{from the realm of}} feasibility study to that of conceptual design, guidelines will be required to ensure that these effects are properly accounted for. A first step in providing such guidelines is the prioritization of interactions for each of the space or surface environments that will be encountered. For those issues that are identified as high priority, the state of environmental knowledge, emphasizing essential data, must be determined. This report describes possible means of obtaining such information, including ground tests, modeling and analysis, and flight experiments. The development of computational tools which will enable engineers to simulate and thereby quantify the interactions will be especially considered. Our analysis is drawn from various study and workshop activities undertaken within the last two years...|$|R
40|$|For {{efficient}} and effective operations on Lunar and/or <b>Martian</b> <b>surfaces,</b> {{it will be necessary}} to develop robots with the ability to successfully perform extended missions of exploration and complex tasks of construction without imposing a large workload on astronauts or requiring high bandwidth, rapid turn-around communications with a ground station. For long-range exploration covering distances of hundreds of kilometers while performing experiments and collecting scientific data along the way, robot vehicle speeds of 2 to 5 meters per second will be required. For construction of habitat and base facilities on lunar or planetary surfaces, ultra-light machines with the capability to lift and position large heavy structures and to manipulate parts and tools will be required. To control such machines in performing complex tasks of exploration or construction, a software architecture is required that can integrate sensing, perception, world modeling, planning, and control into a cognitive system that can understand its situation and behave appropriately under a wide variety of complex situations.

40|$|Automated {{tools for}} {{knowledge}} discovery are frequently invoked in databases where objects already group into some known (i. e., external) classification scheme. In {{the context of}} unsupervised learning or clustering, such tools delve inside large databases looking for alternative classification schemes that are meaningful and novel. An assessment of the information gained with new clusters can be effected {{by looking at the}} degree of separation between each new cluster and its most similar class. Our approach models each cluster and class as a multivariate Gaussian distribution and estimates their degree of separation through an information theoretic measure (i. e., through relative entropy or Kullback Leibler distance). The inherently large computational cost of this step is alleviated by first projecting all data over the single dimension that best separates both distributions (using Fisher’s Linear Discriminant). We test our algorithm on a dataset of <b>Martian</b> <b>surfaces</b> using the traditional division into geological units as external classes and the new, hydrology-inspired, automatically performed division as novel clusters. We find the new partitioning constitutes a formally meaningful classification that deviates substantially from the traditional classification...|$|R
