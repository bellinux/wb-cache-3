25|$|In the mid-to-late 1980s, Gerhard Lengeling and Chris Adam {{developed}} a <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencer</b> {{program for the}} Atari ST platform called Creator. When musical notation capabilities were added, this became Notator, and later Notator SL. For simplicity these three are collectively referred to as Notator.|$|E
25|$|Logic Pro is {{a digital}} audio {{workstation}} and <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencer</b> software application for the macOS platform. It was originally {{created in the}} early 1990s as Notator Logic, or Logic, by German software developer C-Lab, later Emagic. It became an Apple product, eventually known as Logic Pro, after Apple bought Emagic in 2002. It is the 2nd most popular digital audio workstation (DAW) {{according to a survey}} conducted in 2015.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} ways to create techno, but the {{majority}} will depend upon the use of loop-based step sequencing as a compositional method. Techno musicians, or producers, rather than employing traditional compositional techniques, may work in an improvisatory fashion, often treating the electronic music studio as one large instrument. The collection of devices found in a typical studio will include units that are capable of producing many different sounds and effects. Studio production equipment is generally synchronized using a hardware- or computer-based <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencer,</b> enabling the producer to combine in one arrangement the sequenced output of many devices. A typical approach to using this type of technology compositionally is to overdub successive layers of material while continuously looping a single measure or sequence of measures. This process will usually continue until a suitable multi-track arrangement has been produced.|$|E
50|$|Akai also {{produced}} several Digital <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencers</b> and digital synthesizers {{such as the}} MPC range (Music Production Center), a line of integrated drum machines, <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencers,</b> samplers and direct-to-disk recorders that resemble drum machines.|$|R
5000|$|Today {{the term}} [...] "sequencer" [...] {{is often used}} to {{describe}} software. However, hardware sequencers still exist. Workstation keyboards have their own proprietary built-in <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencers.</b> Drum machines and some older synthesizers have their own step sequencer built in. There are still also standalone hardware <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencers,</b> although the market demand for those has diminished greatly due to the greater feature set of their software counterparts.|$|R

500|$|Wild Guns {{was heavily}} {{influenced}} by Dynamite Duke and Blood Bros. during development. The space western setting was largely influenced by the space western manga Cobra. The screen shaking and mirage-like effects that occur after explosions were influenced by the film RoboCop 3. When composing the music for Wild Guns, Hiroyuki Iwatsuki drew upon {{the influence of a}} western soundtrack [...] "Best Of" [...] CD that Natsume had provided him. He enjoyed listening to the CD both during and after development. The game's music was created using PC-98s, a Roland W-30 keyboard, and a <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencer.</b> Some sounds came from the Roland Sound Canvas series.|$|E
500|$|Rahman {{composed}} [...] "Jai Ho" [...] using Logic Pro, {{a digital}} audio workstation and <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencer</b> software application created by Apple Inc. At {{the time of}} the song's production, Rahman had been using the software for almost 12 years. For [...] "Jai Ho", Rahman made extensive use of Logic instruments, including the EXS24, which comprises the EVP88 electric piano and ES2 synth mixed with a few plugins, such as the Channel EQ, Bitcrusher and Guitar Amp Pro. The bassline and the [...] "trancey, arpeggiated" [...] musical line used ES2 presets. For the [...] "long chorus vocals" [...] in the song, Rahman created a [...] "robotic, stair-stepping pitch-bend effect" [...] with Logic's Pitch Correction plugin to achieve the [...] "exaggerated tuning effect".|$|E
2500|$|Logic Pro is {{a hybrid}} 32 / 64 bit digital audio {{workstation}} and <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencer</b> software application for the Mac OS X platform. Originally created by German software developer Emagic, Logic Pro became an Apple product when Apple bought Emagic in 2002. Logic Pro provides software instruments, synthesizers, audio effects and recording facilities for music synthesis. It also supports Apple Loops [...] royalty-free professionally recorded instrument loops. Audio effects include distortions, dynamics processors, equalization filters, and delays. The Space Designer plugin simulates the acoustics of audio played in different environments, such as rooms of varying size, or producing the echoes {{that might be}} heard on high mountains. Logic Pro can work with MIDI keyboards and control surfaces for input and processing, and for MIDI output. It features real-time scoring in musical notation, supporting guitar tablature, chord abbreviations and drum notation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sequencer</b> {{technology}} predates <b>MIDI.</b> Analog <b>sequencers</b> use CV/Gate {{signals to}} control pre-MIDI analog synthesizers. <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencers</b> typically are operated by transport features modeled after those of tape decks. They {{are capable of}} recording MIDI performances, and arranging them into individual tracks along a multitrack recording concept. Music workstations combine controller keyboards with an internal sound generator and a sequencer. These {{can be used to}} build complete arrangements and play them back using their own internal sounds, and function as self-contained music production studios. They commonly include file storage and transfer capabilities.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{on-board}} <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencers</b> {{began to appear}} more frequently on professional synthesizers. The Korg M1 (released 1988) was the first widely known and popular music workstation, and became the world's best-selling digital keyboard synthesizer of all time. During its six-year production period, more than 250,000 units were sold.|$|R

2500|$|An {{arpeggiator}} (arp) is {{a feature}} available on several synthesizers that automatically steps through {{a sequence of}} notes based on an input chord, thus creating an arpeggio. [...] The notes can often be transmitted to a <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencer</b> for recording and further editing. [...] An arpeggiator may have controls for speed, range, and order in which the notes play; upwards, downwards, or in a random order. [...] More advanced arpeggiators allow the user to step through a pre-programmed complex sequence of notes, or play several arpeggios at once. [...] Some allow a pattern sustained after releasing keys: in this way, a sequence of arpeggio patterns may be built up over time by pressing several keys one after the other. Arpeggiators are also commonly found in software sequencers. [...] Some arpeggiators/sequencers expand features into a full phrase sequencer, which allows the user to trigger complex, multi-track blocks of sequenced data from a keyboard or input device, typically synchronized with the tempo of the master clock.|$|E
5000|$|The PadKontrol is {{commonly}} used for controlling virtual drum instruments in a <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencer</b> (such as ezdrummer or BFD). Additionally, the PadKontrol {{can be used to}} control a software sampler (Kontakt, for example) or can be used to control values within a <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencer.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{frequent}} {{application of}} quantization {{in this context}} lies within MIDI application software or hardware. <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencers</b> typically include quantization in their manifest of edit commands. In this case, the dimensions of this timing grid are set beforehand. When one instructs the music application to quantize a certain group of MIDI notes in a song, the program moves each note to the closest point on the timing grid.|$|R

2500|$|Its main rivals at {{the time}} {{included}} Performer, Vision & Steinberg 16. [...] Most <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencers</b> presented a song as a linear set of tracks; however, Notator and Vision were pattern-based sequencers: songs were built by recording patterns (which might represent for example Intro, Verse, Chorus, Middle-8, Outro) with up to 16 tracks each, then assembling an Arrangement of these patterns, with up to 4 patterns playing simultaneously {{at any one time}} in the song. This more closely resembled working principles of hardware sequencers of the 1970s and 1980s.|$|R

50|$|The MC-8 was {{the first}} in the Microcomposer family of sequencers, {{including}} the Roland MC-4 Microcomposer and Roland MC-202. The Roland MC-8 {{had a significant impact on}} electronic music, with the MC-8 and its descendants having more of an impact on electronic music production in the 1970s and 1980s than any other family of sequencers. CV/Gate sequencers such as the MC-8 and MC-4 were eventually succeeded by <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencers</b> in the 1980s. The Microcomposer series continued with grooveboxes, including the Roland MC-202 (1983), MC-303 (1996), MC-505 (1998), MC-09 (1999), MC-307 (1999), MC-909 (2002) and MC-808 (2006).|$|R

50|$|Hex {{is a free}} {{software}} <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencer,</b> which uses a generalized keyboard {{in place of the}} standard piano keyboard. Lanes are extended from the keys and MIDI notes can be drawn into each lane, and edited, with the mouse (as in a standard <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencer</b> like Logic, Reaper, SONAR, etc.). The layout can be sheared to ensure that the vertical height of each key (and note lane) is proportional to its pitch height—regardless of the tuning used. A wide variety of isomorphic layouts are possible, including Bosanquet and Wicki.|$|E
5000|$|A tempo map {{is a part}} of a MIDI file. Musical events {{occur as}} a {{succession}} of events in time, whose speed is tempo. Music also organizes these according to a framework called meter, by partitioning time into patterns of [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "weak" [...] beats. MIDI's tempo map specifies the speed at which a file's events are transmitted within this framework: their tempo. If a file plays at a fixed tempo, its map is a horizontal line (e.g., measures 38 and 39 in this part of a <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencer’s</b> display of the end of J.S. Bach’s prelude #8 from Book I of the Well-tempered Clavier): ...|$|R
5000|$|In MIDI, the {{instrument}} sound or [...] "program" [...] {{for each of}} the 16 possible MIDI channels is selected with the Program Change message, which has a Program Number parameter. The following table shows which instrument sound corresponds to each of the 128 possible Program Numbers for GM only. There are 128 program numbers. The numbers can be displayed as values 1 to 128, or, alternatively, as 0 to 127. The 0 to 127 numbering is usually only used internally by the synthesizer; the vast majority of MIDI devices, digital audio workstations and professional <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencers</b> display these Program Numbers as shown in the table (1-128).|$|R
