Johnston made an appearance at the city-centre Woolworths store in his home town of Carlisle to celebrate the album launch on 1 October, and spoke to reporters for the local paper The Cumberland News, saying [...] "I am really grateful to <b>my</b> <b>local</b> supporters and it is great to take part in my first signing here in Carlisle."

500|$|His {{contract}} was terminated {{by mutual consent}} with a year to run on 16 June 2008 and he joined Wycombe later that day. On joining Wycombe, Mousinho said [...] "It's been <b>my</b> <b>local</b> club since I was quite young so I've been down here {{a few times and}} it was the lure of that, plus the chance to work with Peter Taylor, that made me jump at the chance". He made his debut for Wycombe in a 1–1 draw against Morecambe, and scored his first goal for the club shortly after in a 2–0 away victory over Chester City. Shortly after this, Wycombe triggered a one–year extension clause in his contract, subsequently keeping him at the club until 2010. Mousinho scored his second goal of the season in Wycombe's 3–3 draw against his former employers, Brentford, netting in the first–half of the game with a volley. Two weeks later, he provided the assist for John Akinde's goal in the club's 1–1 draw with Barnet. He played a total of 38 times in all competitions during his first season with the club, scoring twice as Wycombe earned promotion to League One after finishing in the third and final automatic promotion place. The following season, he played a further 41 games for the club, scoring once in a 5–2 home defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion, but Wycombe were relegated {{at the end of the}} season. During his two years at Wycombe, he played a total of 79 times for the club, scoring three goals.|$|E

2500|$|Drummer Tony Williams was {{an early}} influence. [...] "The first drummer I ever saw, where I got to feel the impact up close, was Tony Williams", Blackman said. [...] "When I was 16, Tony came to <b>my</b> <b>local</b> drum store with a bassist and did a [...] clinic that left a {{powerful}} impression on me. And that's what I thought drumming should be: drummers should {{have a lot of}} impact and a great sound, without being limited to a conventional role in the band—the drums should speak just as freely as anybody." [...] Blackman says that the way that Williams used all four limbs to attack the drums strongly influenced her. [...] "I just love and loved everything about Tony", says Blackman. [...] "To me, not only was he a master technician, a master drummer, the innovator of the age, but also, he was a sound innovator. He had so many things that elevated the sound and the level of skill required to play this kind of music." [...] But although Blackman is sometimes referred to as a disciple of Tony Williams, she follows her own path. [...] "On the one hand, it doesn't bother me at all to be associated and in line with a master of the instrument like that – Okay, I might not be where I want to be, but I'm on the right track", says Blackman. [...] "On the other hand, I don't plan on being a clone. What I'm doing is always looking to expound on something that he's done, or push the music in a different way".|$|E

6000|$|And as I {{came into}} the cloud of London I met {{a friend of mine}} who {{actually}} is in a bank, and submitted these suggestions in rhyme to him for use among his colleagues. But he was not very hopeful about the matter. It was not (he assured me) that he underrated the verses, or in any sense lamented their lack of polish. No; it was rather, he felt, an indefinable something in the very atmosphere of the society in which we live that makes it spiritually difficult to sing in banks. And I think he must be right; though the matter is very mysterious. I may observe here that I think there must be some mistake in the calculations of the Socialists. They put down all our distress, not to a moral tone, but to the chaos of private enterprise. Now, banks are private; but post-offices are Socialistic: therefore I naturally expected that the post-office would fall into the collectivist idea of a chorus. Judge of my surprise when the lady in <b>my</b> <b>local</b> post-office (whom I urged to sing) dismissed the idea with far more coldness than the bank clerk had done. She seemed indeed, to be in a considerably greater state of depression than he.

Then, as I could afford it, I'd rise a little, and give first-class non-partisan reports of local political affairs; that would fetch the next largest class, the ward politicians of all parties. I'd lay for the local religious world, after that;--religion comes right after politics in the popular mind, and it interests the women like murder: I'd give the minutest religious intelligence, and not only that, but the religious gossip, and the religious scandal. Then I'd go in for fashion and society,--that comes next. I'd have the most reliable and thorough-going financial reports that money could buy. When I'd got <b>my</b> <b>local</b> ground perfectly covered, I'd begin to ramify. Every fellow that could spell, in any part of the country, should understand that, if he sent me an account of a suicide, or an elopement, or a murder, or an accident, he should be well paid for it; and I'd rise on the same scale through all the departments. I'd add art criticisms, dramatic and sporting news, and book reviews, more for the looks of the thing than for anything else; they don't any of 'em appeal to a large class. I'd get my paper into such a shape that people of every kind and degree would have to say, no matter what particular objection was made to it, 'Yes, that's so; but it's the best newspaper in the world, and we can't get along without it.'" ...|$|E

My Visitor was charming, intelligent, kind, all visibly a great master of the question; but he prescribed me a remedy, to begin its action directly he had left, that simply and at a short notice sent me down into hell, where I lay sizzling (never such a sizzle before) for three days, and has since followed it up with another under the dire effect of which I languish even as I now write....

6000|$|... "Thy will be done" [...] is a {{petition}} {{which can be}} offered up in two quite distinct senses. In the one, it {{is an expression of}} resignation to the Father's afflictive dispensations; in the other, the heartfelt desire to work out the revealed will of God in all the many-sided aspects of life. In the first sense, when sorrow or death has entered our door, our first impulse, if we are Christians, is to give evidence of, and expression to, our resignation by recognizing the will of God. Hence Mr. Ruskin interposes: [...] "Are you so sure that it was the will of God that your child should die, or that you should have got into that trouble?" [...] I look in <b>my</b> <b>local</b> paper in the column of deaths, and see in a neighbouring large town how extraordinary a proportion of deaths are those of children. I have taken occasional cemetery duty in one of the busiest centres of industry in Yorkshire, and was shocked at the large numbers of funerals in white. Am I to believe it was the will of God that so many young children should perish, especially as I look to my own beautiful parish, with its sweet sea and mountain breezes mingled, where the deaths of children are comparatively rare? and am I not forced to believe that, even without the assistance of destitution--neglect and overcrowding, and [...] "quieting mixtures" [...] and ardent spirits, and kicks and blows have filled most of those little graves? I fear that the will of Satan is here being accomplished vastly to his satisfaction. And seldom does the Government do more than touch the fringe of these monstrous evils. Of course they say [...] "We cannot interfere," [...] or [...] "Legislation in these matters is impracticable." [...] But can we not all remember when it was just as certain that free trade in food was impracticable? but who does not see that it is saving us from famine this dark year 1879?--that compulsory education was revolutionary and full of unimaginable perils to the country, and yet who are so glad as the poor themselves, now that it has been carried into effect? It used to be thought that if people chose to kill themselves with unwholesome open drains before their doors, there was no power able to prevent them. But we are wiser now. Legislators have generally been, or chosen to appear, like cowards till the time for action came, very late, and then they were decided enough. Now let us hope that a way may be found to save infant life from premature extinction by wholesale.|$|E
