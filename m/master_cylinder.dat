25|$|In {{position}} one, {{the valve}} is open; {{pressure from the}} <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> is passed right through to the brake.|$|E
25|$|In {{position}} two, {{the valve}} blocks the line, isolating that brake from the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This prevents {{the pressure from}} rising further should the driver push the brake pedal harder.|$|E
25|$|For example, the Rambler Classic was {{equipped}} with a standard tandem <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> in 1962 that provided stopping ability {{even if there was}} a failure in the brake system. Only Cadillac also included this safety feature six years before U.S. safety regulations required it on all cars.|$|E
50|$|Radial <b>master</b> <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Disc brakes were used. Rear discs were mounted inboard of the hub carrier. Twin <b>master</b> <b>cylinders</b> with {{adjustable}} ratio balance bar {{were also}} included.|$|R
50|$|Brakes were {{hydraulic}} {{and assisted}} by the Rolls-Royce mechanical servo with 11 in drums and suspension was independent coils {{at the front}} and semi-elliptic springs at the rear. Twin brake <b>master</b> <b>cylinders</b> were incorporated from April 1956.|$|R
25|$|The 1967 {{model year}} {{required}} new safety equipment. A new energy-absorbing steering column {{was accompanied by}} an energy-absorbing steering wheel, padded instrument panel, non-protruding control knobs, and four-way emergency flashers. A shoulder belt option was also featured, and the brake <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> was now a dual reservoir unit with a backup hydraulic circuit.|$|E
25|$|For 1967 all Fords {{featured}} a large, padded hub {{in the center}} of the plastic steering wheel, along with an energy-absorbing steering column (introduced late into the 1967 model year), padded interior surfaces, recessed controls on the instrument panel, and front outboard shoulder belt anchors. Another safety related change was the introduction of the dual brake <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> used on all subsequent Galaxies (and other Ford models).|$|E
25|$|In 1920 the French {{automobile}} and aircraft pioneer Gabriel Voisin experimented with systems that modulated the hydraulic braking pressure on his aircraft brakes {{to reduce the}} risk of tire slippage. These systems use a flywheel and valve attached to a hydraulic line that feeds the brake cylinders. The flywheel is attached to a drum that runs at the same speed as the wheel. In normal braking, the drum and flywheel should spin at the same speed. However, when a wheel slows down, then the drum would do the same, leaving the flywheel spinning at a faster rate. This causes the valve to open, allowing a small amount of brake fluid to bypass the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> into a local reservoir, lowering the pressure on the cylinder and releasing the brakes. The use of the drum and flywheel meant the valve only opened when the wheel was turning. In testing, a 30% improvement in braking performance was noted, because the pilots immediately applied full brakes instead of slowly increasing pressure in order to find the skid point. An additional benefit was the elimination of burned or burst tires.|$|E
50|$|The {{ladder frame}} was retained, with the {{aluminum}} body supported by hoops. Lockheed twin-shoe disc brakes became standard, coupled to two <b>master</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The suspension was Fiat 500 {{transverse leaf spring}} independent suspension, used at front and rear.|$|R
50|$|The {{monocoque}} chassis {{extends from}} the front bulkhead to the rearmost engine-transmission mount. The actual chassis projects forwards {{as far as the}} front suspension location, but the pedals, <b>master</b> <b>cylinders,</b> radiator, and so on are hung on outriggers built on to the monocoque.|$|R
50|$|The Monster's {{brake system}} {{components}} including <b>master</b> <b>cylinders</b> and discs are supplied by Brembo. The front has 320 mm floating dual discs and radially mounted 4 piston Brembo p4.32 calipers. The 245 mm rear solid disc have a two-piston p34 caliper. Anti-lock braking system (ABS) is optional.|$|R
2500|$|Some older designs, {{like the}} AMP and Mountain Cycles brakes, use a cable from lever to caliper, {{then use a}} <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{integrated}} into the piston. Some Santana tandem bicycles used a cable from lever to a <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> mounted near the head tube, with a hydraulic line to the rear wheel caliper. Such [...] "hybrid" [...] designs allow the leverage of a hydraulic system while allowing use of cable brake levers, but may be heavier and can suffer from grit intrusion in the standard cable.|$|E
2500|$|... 1981 models {{saw only}} minor revisions. Styling was {{unchanged}} {{other than the}} grille which remained egg crate style but now had larger sections. Refinements included redesigned front disc brakes for less drag and a translucent plastic <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> reservoir. The cruise control became equipped with a resume feature, while wire wheel covers had locking bolts to secure them in place. This was {{the last year for}} the Delco GM 40-channel CB radio built into the AM/FM radio option.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968 Oldsmobile {{continued}} to produce five well appointed 98 body styles. Standard equipment included: dual <b>master</b> <b>cylinder,</b> four way flasher, energy-absorbing steering column, back-up lights, side marker lights, seat belts, cross-flow radiator, rear armrest ashtrays, power brakes, electric clock, special moldings, shoulder belts, Deluxe steering wheel, power steering, carpeted trunk and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission. Upholstery was cloth, vinyl or leather. Standard tire size was 8.85 x 14inches. Engine displacement was increased to the Rocket [...] V8 with 365 horsepower. Ninety-Eight production was in Lansing.|$|E
25|$|Drive train, {{front and}} rear suspension, brakes, radiators, <b>master</b> <b>cylinders,</b> trunnions, {{steering}} columns, power steering pumps, engines, transmissions, brake drums and rotors are interchangeable with 1965 and 1966 Ambassadors and Classics. Some parts are even interchangeable back to 1958 and earlier, while other components were used by AMC into the 1970s.|$|R
2500|$|Brakes used a two-circuit {{hydraulic}} system (two fluid distributors and two <b>master</b> <b>cylinders,</b> {{one for the}} front {{and one for the}} rear), Lockheed-type duplex brakes [...] drums all round. An equaliser was fitted, which could avoid overbraking by changing the distribution of braking force between the front and rear brakes during driving.|$|R
2500|$|The cars use {{disc brakes}} {{supplied}} by AP Racing {{on the front}} and rear, with the <b>master</b> <b>cylinders</b> provided by AP Racing or former control brake supplier Alcon. The front discs have a diameter of [...] and a six-piston caliper, while the rear discs are [...] diameter and have a four-piston caliper.|$|R
2500|$|For {{disc brakes}} with a {{hydraulic}} system, high-performance calipers usually use {{two or three}} pistons per side; lower-cost and lower-performance calipers often have only one per side. Using more pistons allows a larger piston area and thus increased leverage with a given <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Also, pistons may be of several sizes so pad force can be controlled {{across the face of}} the pad, especially when the pad is long and narrow. [...] A long narrow pad may be desired to increase pad area and thus reduce the frequency of pad changes. [...] In contrast, a single large piston may be heavier.|$|E
2500|$|The dual-reservoir brake <b>master</b> <b>cylinder,</b> with {{separate}} {{front and rear}} hydraulic systems, was introduced in 1962, six years ahead of the Federal requirement. [...] The first fully automatic heater-air conditioning system also appeared, as did the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission; it would become the GM standard model for several decades. [...] From the late 1960s, Cadillac offered a fiber-optic warning system to alert the driver to failed light bulbs. The use of extensive bright-work on the exterior and interior also decreased each year after 1959. By the 1966 model year, even the rear bumpers ceased to be all chrome – large portions were painted, including the headlight bezels.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the years}} the type of wax used in {{cylinders}} was improved and hardened so that cylinders could be played with good quality over 100 times. In 1902 Edison Records launched a line of improved hard wax cylinders marketed as [...] "Edison Gold Molded Records". [...] The major development of this line of cylinders is that Edison had developed a process that allowed a mold to be made from a <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> which then permitted the production of several hundred cylinders to be made from the mold. The impressive mention of gold referred only to the extremely thin gold coating deposited onto the master wax cylinder to make it electrically conductive, {{the first step in}} creating the metal mold.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} replaces traditional components {{such as the}} pumps, hoses, fluids, {{belts and}} vacuum servos and <b>master</b> <b>cylinders</b> with electronic sensors and actuators. Drive-by-wire technology in automotive industry replaces the traditional mechanical and hydraulic control systems with electronic control systems using electromechanical actuators and human-machine interfaces such as pedal and steering feel emulators.|$|R
50|$|Brake fluids {{must not}} corrode the metals used inside {{components}} such as calipers, wheel <b>cylinders,</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinders</b> and ABS control valves. They must also protect against corrosion as moisture enters the system. Additives (corrosion inhibitors) {{are added to}} the base fluid to accomplish this. Silicone is less corrosive to paintwork unlike glycol-ether based DOT fluids.|$|R
50|$|The cars use {{disc brakes}} {{supplied}} by AP Racing {{on the front}} and rear, with the <b>master</b> <b>cylinders</b> provided by AP Racing or former control brake supplier Alcon. The front discs have a diameter of 395 mm and a six-piston caliper, while the rear discs are 355 mm diameter and have a four-piston caliper.|$|R
2500|$|In 1967, the Corvair {{line was}} trimmed to the 500 and Monza Hardtop Coupes and Hardtop Sedans, and the Monza Convertible. This model {{year was the}} first with a {{collapsible}} steering column. A dual circuit <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> with warning light, nylon reinforced brake hoses, stronger steel (instead of aluminum) door hinges, [...] "mushroomed" [...] instrument panel knobs and a vinyl-edged day/night mirror were all made standard equipment. Bucket seats in Monza models were now of the same [...] "Astro" [...] style as those on the new-for-1967 Camaro, featuring a new-thin-shell design. [...] Chevrolet introduced a [...] engine warranty on all Chevrolet models including the Corvair. Chevrolet was still actively marketing the Corvair in 1967, including color print ads and an [...] "I Love My Corvair" [...] bumper sticker campaign by dealers, but production and sales continued to fall off drastically. Only 27,253 copies were built.|$|E
2500|$|The Skyline GT-R 'N1' model (identified by {{the model}} code suffix [...] "ZN"), was {{introduced}} on 19 July 1991, and designed for home-market N1 racing {{with a total}} of 245 units eventually produced (118 of these are 'N1', 64 are 'V·Spec N1', and 63 are 'V·Spec II N1' - see below explanation of 'V.spec'). The most notable change was in the engine, which was upgraded to the R32-N1 specification. Building on the 'Nismo' car's specification, it was also lightened by the removal of the ABS, and rear wiper, but for 'N1' the air conditioning, sound system, and boot carpet were also deleted, and distinctive light-weight headlights were fitted. 'N1' cars also had reinforcing for the brake <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> and additional brake cooling ducts under the car. All 'N1' cars were delivered with a thin layer of colour code 326 [...] "Crystal White" [...] paint.|$|E
2500|$|The 1967 models {{received}} a facelift. Large wraparound taillamps {{went into a}} new rear end with standard backup lights. [...] "What you'll see inside," [...] claimed the sales brochure for the 1967 Chevelle, [...] "will probably bring on a severe compulsion to go driving." [...] Front disc brakes were available on all models, and a new dual <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> brake system incorporated a warning light. [...] Chevrolet also added 14" [...] wheels and a three speed automatic transmission to their line of transmissions. New safety equipment became standard, including a collapsible steering column. The SS396 continued as its own series with both sport coupe and convertible body styles. The 375-horsepower 396-cubic-inch V8 was dropped from the options list {{until late in the}} model year and returned with 612 being sold. Seven transmissions were available: two manual three-speeds, two manual four-speeds, an overdrive three-speed, and two automatics. The manual-shift feature of the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission was featured. Options included Superlift air shock absorbers, Strato-ease headrests, and special instrumentation.|$|E
50|$|The {{process is}} {{performed}} by forcing clean, bubble-free brake fluid {{through the entire}} system, usually from the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder(s)</b> to the calipers of disc brakes (or the wheel cylinders of drum brakes), but in certain cases in the opposite direction. A brake bleed screw is normally mounted at the highest point on each cylinder or caliper.|$|R
50|$|Braking is {{achieved}} by a disc brake mounted on the rear axle. Front disc brakes are used in most shifter kart classes and are increasingly popular in other classes; however, certain classes do not allow them. Shifter karts have dual <b>master</b> <b>cylinders,</b> one for the front {{and one for the}} rear and are adjustable to allow for front/ rear bias changes.|$|R
50|$|The {{rear-wheel drive}} Type 175, 178 and 180 chassis is {{considerably}} {{more sophisticated than}} its 135 predecessor, the front suspension being independent with pivoting horizontal cylinders that contained a powerful coil-spring and hydraulic shock absorber in an oil-bath Dubonnet. The rear was by de Dion, with semi-elliptical springs. Brakes were hydraulic type made by Lockheed. The brake-drums were deeply finned cast-iron, actuated by dual <b>master</b> <b>cylinders</b> with a balance-bar drums all around.|$|R
2500|$|The Valiant was {{completely}} redesigned for 1967 model {{year and the}} station wagons, hardtops, and convertibles were dropped. Buyers who wanted a Valiant-type hardtop coupe or convertible could choose a similarly-styled Barracuda, which was still based on the Valiant with a slightly sportier style. [...] The new Valiant model range included 2- and 4-door sedans on a newly lengthened [...] wheelbase. The design was straightforward and rectilinear. The body sides were mildly sculptured with a tapering lower feature line that widened toward the wheels. The new fenders had a vertical slab look. The grille was vertically split and subdivided horizontally. Vertical taillights were segmented and had a fanned-out look. Horsepower rating for the [...] Slant-6 engine was raised from [...] to [...] by installation of the slightly bigger camshaft introduced on the 225 in 1965, together with Carter BBS and Holley 1920 carburetors using the larger [...] throttle bore previously reserved for the 225, rather than the smaller [...] carburetors formerly used on the 170 engine. [...] Federally-mandated safety equipment was provided on all 1967s, including a new dual-chamber brake <b>master</b> <b>cylinder,</b> energy-absorbing steering column, wheel, and instrument panel controls; shoulder belt mountings for outboard front passengers, a new 4-way hazard flasher, and, for 1970, lane-change directional signals were included.|$|E
2500|$|Four-wheel {{disc brakes}} were also {{introduced}} in 1965. The brakes had a four-piston design with two-piece calipers and cooling fins for the rotors. Pads were in frequent {{contact with the}} rotors, but the resulting drag was negligible and did not affect fuel economy. Further, the light touching kept the rotors clean and did not diminish pad life, which was, in fact, quite high: a projected [...] for the front brakes and about twice that distance for the rear binders. Total swept area for the new system was , a notable advance on the [...] of the previous all-drum system. Per pending federal regulation, {{there was also a}} dual <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> with separate fluid reservoirs (only on models with power brakes for 1965) for the front and rear lines. Road testers rightly applauded the all-disc brakes. Testers found that repeated stops from [...] produced no deterioration in braking efficiency, and even the most sudden stops were rock-stable. The drum brakes remained available, however, as a $64.50 credit option, but only 316 of the 23,562 Corvettes built that year came with drums. A side exhaust system appeared as an option as did a telescopic steering wheel. Also available were alloy spinner rims, at US$322 a set.|$|E
5000|$|If {{bleeding}} brakes {{because of}} <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> replacement the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> is usually [...] "bench bled" [...] before installation. Typically by securing {{it on the}} bench, filling it with fluid, connecting fittings and hoses to route fluid from the outlet ports on the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> back to its reservoir, and repeatedly depressing the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> plunger until bubbles are no longer seen coming from the hoses.|$|E
50|$|Steering was worm and sector with Hardy disc.Brakes used a two-circuit {{hydraulic}} system (two fluid distributors and two <b>master</b> <b>cylinders,</b> {{one for the}} front {{and one for the}} rear), Lockheed-type duplex brakes 17 x 2 in drums all round. An equaliser was fitted, which could avoid overbraking by changing the distribution of braking force between the front and rear brakes during driving.5.50-18 racing crossply tyres were mounted on Alfa Romeo 18-inch Rudge-type wire wheels.|$|R
40|$|Brake-by-wire {{represents}} {{the replacement of}} traditional brake components such as pumps, hoses, fluids, brake boosters, and <b>master</b> <b>cylinders</b> by electronic sensors and actuators. The different design of these brake concepts poses new challenges for the automotive industry with regard to availability and fallback levels in comparison to standard conventional brake systems. This contribution focuses {{on the development of}} appropriate fallback level concepts. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) techniques and field trials will be used to investigate the performance and the usability of such systems...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{hydraulic}} brake system, the driver applies force by a mechanical link from the {{pedal to the}} <b>master</b> brake <b>cylinder.</b> In turn the <b>master</b> brake <b>cylinder</b> develops hydraulic pressure in the wheels. In contrast, the electro-hydraulic brake SBC provides the brakes with a brake fluid supply from the hydraulic high-pressure reservoir, which is sufficient for several braking events. A piston pump driven by an electric motor supplies a controlled brake fluid pressure between 140 and 160 Bar in the gas diaphragm reservoir.|$|R
