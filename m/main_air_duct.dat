40|$|Abstract. CFD {{technique}} is often employed to simulate and optimize air duct design, but the corresponding experiment validation in metro vehicle is rare. By taking an independent metro vehicle duct as research object in this paper, supply air through air duct is simulated and {{compared with the}} actual test results from the angle of supply air velocity at each outlet and supply air volume through several outlets of air duct. The {{results show that the}} relative deviation of simulation and test value of air velocity at most of the outlets are within or near ± 20 %, which is acceptable for the engineering applications. Moreover, the ratio of supply air volume through several outlets to the corresponding total supply air volume through <b>main</b> <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> or flat duct in the case of simulation is consistent with {{that in the case of}} experiment. It can be concluded that numerical simulation method is effective and reliable in air duct optimization design of metro vehicle...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this program was the {{characterization}} of the soils beneath the <b>main</b> <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> connecting the exhaust plenums with the Fan House. The air plenums experienced water intrusion during BGRR operations and after shutdown. The water intrusions were attributed to rainwater leaks into degraded parts {{of the system and}} to internal cooling water system leaks. As part of the overall characterization efforts, a state-of-the-art gaseous perfluorocarbon tracer technology was utilized to characterize leak pathways from the ducts. This in turn suggests what soil regions under or adjacent to the ductwork should be emphasized in the characterization process. Knowledge of where gaseous tracers leak from the ducts yields a conservative picture of where water transport, out of or into, the ducts might have occurred...|$|R
40|$|In a VAV (variable air volume) system, the {{set point}} of the static {{pressure}} (usually measured at 213 downstream of the <b>main</b> supply <b>air</b> <b>duct)</b> is maintained by modulating the fan speed or inlet guide vane position. The set {{point of the}} static pressure is often set at a constant value, which is adequate to provide design flow to each room. This method consumes more fan power than necessary under partial load conditions. The fan speed or inlet guide vane can also be controlled based on the maximum damper position of the terminal boxes. This method is called air volume control logic. Under this control logic, terminal box airflow requirements are met with reduced static pressure. Fan power consumption is minimized. However, the actual system performance also depends on other factors, such as inaccurate temperature or flow sensors, faulty control valves, unbalanced loads, etc. This paper discusses the existing air volume control logic, its reliability and an improved air volume control logic...|$|R

40|$|In {{the process}} of design, {{development}} and certification of a turbo-prop Light Transport Aircraft (LTA), an important aspect is to establish the installed performance of the engine before carrying out actual flight tests. In this context, it is relevant to study and analyse behaviour of the engine air intake performance before commencing actual flight tests. CFD analysis of flow {{in and around the}} nacelle and engine <b>air</b> intake <b>duct</b> was carried out using two RANS based models, S-A and SST k-omega using the commercial software ANSYS Fluent. Special emphasis was laid on developing a good quality mesh for the computational domain with a finer boundary layer mesh along the wall and by maintaining a higher density mesh at critical areas. Ram air recovery and mass flow rate of <b>main</b> <b>air</b> intake <b>duct</b> has been established from the results obtained. The results obtained from the CFD study have shown that the inlet system pressure loss and ram air recovery are within limits prescribed by the engine original equipment manufacturer.

40|$|The Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor is {{currently}} on an accelerated decommissioning schedule with a completion date projected for 2005. The accelerated schedule combines characterization with removal actions for the various systems and structures. A major project issue involves characterization of the soils beneath contaminated Below Grade <b>Ducts</b> (BGD), the <b>main</b> <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> connecting the exhaust plenums with the Fan House. The air plenums experienced water intrusion during BGRR operations and after shutdown. The water intrusions were attributed to rainwater leaks into degraded parts of the system, and to internal cooling water system leaks. If the characterization could provide enough information to show that soil contamination surrounding the BGD is either below cleanup guidelines or is very localized and can be ''surgically removed'' at a reasonable cost, the ducts may be decontaminated and left in place. This will provide significant savings compared to breaking up the 170 -ft. long concrete duct, shipping the projected 9, 000 m{sup 3 } of waste off-site and disposing of it in an approved site. The focus of this Department of Energy Accelerated Site Technology Deployment (DOE ASTD) project {{was to determine the}} extent (location, type, and level) of soil contamination surrounding the BGD. A suite of innovative characterization tools was used to complete the characterization of the soil surrounding the BGD in a cost-effective and timely fashion and in a manner acceptable to the stakeholders. A state-of-the-art perfluorocarbon tracer (PFT) technology was used to screen the BGD for existing leak pathways and thus focus the characterization on potential contamination ''hot spots. '' Once pathways were identified, the sampling and analysis plan was designed to emphasize the leaking areas of the duct and perform only confirmatory checks in areas shown to be leak-free. A small-footprint Geoprobe{reg_sign} was used obtain core samples and allowed sampling in areas surrounding the BGD that were difficult to access. Two novel, field-deployed, radiological analysis systems (ISOCS and BetaScint{trademark}) were used to analyze the core samples and a three-dimensional (3 -D) visualization system facilitated data analysis/interpretation for the stakeholders. All of the technologies performed as well or better than expected and the characterization could not have been completed in the same time or at the same cost without using this approach. A total of 904 BGD soil samples were taken, evaluated, and modeled. Results indicated that contamination was primarily located in discrete areas near several expansion joints and underground structures (bustles), but that much of the soil beneath and surrounding the BGD was clean of any radiological contamination. One-year project cost savings are calculated to be $ 1, 254 K. Life cycle cost savings, resulting from {{reduction in the number of}} samples and the cost of sample analysis, are estimated to be $ 2, 162 K. When added to potential cost savings associated with decontaminating and leaving the BGD in place ($ 7. 1 to 8. 1 M), far greater overall savings may be realized...|$|R
40|$|Background: High-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> is the {{government}} program to supply electricity needs. However, in practice, obstacles {{have been identified in}} the form of rejection from the community due to the outstanding issues that high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> have an impact on health. Aim: This research aims to analysis the magnitude of electromagnetic wave radiation of high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> construction on health. Methods: The study was conducted by measuring electromagnetic wave radiation prior to high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> (150 kV) construction and predicting the amount of radiation generated after this operation and its impact on health. Result: The field measurement result showed that the highest strength of magnetic field in the absence of construction and operation activity of high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> 150 kV was 0. 00085 mT and the highest electric field was 0. 004241251 V/m. The results of the magnetic field strength analysis showed that the highest strength of magnetic field and electric field when the high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> is completed and operated was magnetic field of 0. 00415 mT and electric field of 38. 4 V/m. The value was far lower than the standard limits recommended by IRPA / INIRC, WHO 1990 and SNI 04 - 6950 - 2003. The allowed electric field strength is 5 kV / m and the allowed magnetic field strength is 0. 1 mT. Conclusion: Electromagnetic wave radiation of High-Voltage <b>Air</b> <b>Ducts</b> is not exceeded the allowed limit, so it will not cause a direct risk to health. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{underground}} <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> along peripheral {{walls of}} a building are a remediation method, which principle is to enable an air flow along the moist building structure’s surface to allow a sufficient evaporation of moisture from the structure. This measure reduces the water transport (rising moisture) into the higher parts of the wall where the high water content in masonry is undesirable. Presently, underground <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> are designed as masonry structures, which durability in contact with ground moisture is limited.
