In single-particle tracking, the individual molecule must be both bright and sparse {{enough to be}} tracked from one video to the other. Correlation spectroscopy analyzes the intensity fluctuations resulting from migration of fluorescent objects {{into and out of}} a small volume at the focus of a laser. In photomarking, a fluorescent protein can be dequenched in a subcellular area with the use of intense local illumination and the fate of the <b>marked</b> <b>molecule</b> can be imaged directly.

The bifurcations are organized by 13 dierent singularities, six of which are relative equilibria, and seven degenerate critical orbits. The bare molecules for the ten types of isoenergy surfaces have been determined earlier, but important information about the connection between admissible coordinate systems at dierent bifurcations has been missing so far. This gap is lled with the computation of <b>marked</b> <b>molecules,</b> based on a new method which uses molecules corresponding to loops around singular points in the bifurcation diagram.

The theoretical results are applicable in particular {{to the analysis of}} fluorescence correlation spectroscopy of <b>marked</b> <b>molecules</b> in biological systems.

40|$|The {{radionuclide}} {{purity of}} a radiopharmaceutical product is usually measured by gamma-ray spectrometry with various measurement geometries. The {{importance of this}} test is that the radionuclide impurities, if present, result {{in an increase in}} the radiation dose to the patient without contributing to diagnostic information and in some cases may also interfere with the <b>marking</b> <b>molecules</b> and affect the proper conduct of diagnostic examination. In this work, gamma-ray spectrometry is used to determine the amounts of impurities by adopting as measurement geometry the same bottle containing eluted or prepared radiopharmaceuticals. In addition to high-purity germanium semiconductor detectors, the usefulness of NaI(Tl) and LaBr 3 (Ce) scintillators in routine operation is also examined.

40|$|Relationships between {{statistical}} {{properties of}} Eulerian velocity (in a fixed reference frame) and Lagrangian velocity (i. e. {{the velocity of}} <b>marked</b> <b>molecules)</b> are examined for the case of diffusion in velocity fields described by random space functions. Assuming a constant diffusion co-efficient and a divergence-free homogeneous Eulerian random field, we give simple proofs of the statistical homogeneity of the Lagrangian ve-locity field and of the equality between the Lagrangian and Eulerian one-point marginal probability densities. Further, we analyze numerical simulations using velocity fields generated with a classical randomiza-tion method. The numerical Eulerian velocity is homogeneous within a reasonably small confidence interval. Surprisingly, at early times the Lagrangian mean velocity still depends on {{the starting point of}} the tra-jectory and shows small oscillations which, however, are well beyond the confidence interval for the Eulerian mean velocity. We demonstrate that the lack of strict statistical homogeneity of the Lagrangian velocity in-duces a dependence of the second moment of the ensemble averaged con-centration on the initial concentration distribution. At large times, the simulated Lagrangian mean velocity tends to the Eulerian mean velocity and the second moment of the mean concentration loses the memory of the initial conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose to}} combine image {{registration}} and volumetric reconstruction from a monocular {{video of a}} draining off Hele-Shaw cell filled with water. A Hele-Shaw cell is a tank whose depth is small (e. g. 1 mm) {{compared to the other}} dimensions (e. g. 400 × 800 mm 2). We use a technique known as molecular tagging which consists in marking by photobleaching a pattern in the fluid and then tracking its deformations. The evolu-tion of the pattern is filmed with a camera whose principal axis coincides with the depth of the cell. The velocity of the fluid along this direction is not constant. Consequently, tracking the pattern cannot be achieved with classical methods because what is observed is the integration of the <b>marked</b> <b>molecules</b> over the entire depth of the cell. The proposed approach is built on top of classical direct image registration in which we incorporate a volumetric image formation model. It allows us to accurately measure the motion and the velocity profiles for the entire volume (including the depth of the cell) which is some-thing usually hard to achieve. The results we obtain are consistent with the theoretical hydrodynamic behaviour for this flow which is known as the laminar Poiseuille flow. ...|$|R

40|$|Labeling by isotopic {{exchange}} reactions {{is one of}} the conventional techniques for preparing <b>marked</b> <b>molecules.</b> The use of heterogeneous exchange reactions has the advantage that the labeled product can be separated more easily from the labeled starting material than in homogeneous systems. Fast heterogeneous exchange reactions can also be carried out in a dynamic system by means of gas chromatographic reaction columns. Some years ago we have shown $^{(1), (2) }$ l that labeling of alkyl bromides with bromine- 82 can be readily achieved when carrier-free radio bromine ions were adsorbed on a gas chromatographic adsorbent and the inactive alkyl bromide, injected into the carrier gas, was passed through the adsorbent at elevated temperatures. This method has been extended by us to non-isotopic element exchange reactions on gas chromatographic columns, thus leading to carrier-free labeled alkyl halides when an additional separation column was placed behind the reaction column. This technique is simple and fast since it combines preparation and purification of the labeled compound, and we have used it among others to prepare fluorine- 18 labeled alkyl fluorides. In addition a halogen-tritium element exchange can lead to specifically tritium-labeled alkanes $^{(3) }$. Recently Elias$^{(4) }$ has also shown that iodine- 131 tagged alkyl iodides can be prepared via {{isotopic exchange}} reactions on gas chromatographic columns using iodine- 131 labeled potassium iodide as stationary phase on an adsorbent...|$|R

40|$|Fluorescent {{proteins}} (FPs) {{are widely}} used in biochemistry, biology and biophysics. For quantitative analysis of gene expression FPs are often used as <b>marking</b> <b>molecules.</b> Therefore, sufficient knowledge of maturation times and their affecting factors is of high interest. Here, we investigate the maturation process of the FPs GFP and mCherry expressed by the three closely related Escherichia coli strains of the Colicin E 2 system, a model system for colicinogenic interaction. One strain, the C strain produces Colicin, a toxin to which the S strain is sensitive, and against which the R strain is resistant. Under the growth conditions used in this study, the S and R strain have similar growth rates, {{as opposed to the}} C strain whose growth rate is significantly reduced due to the toxin production. In combination with theoretical modelling we studied the maturation kinetics of the two FPs in these strains and could confirm an exponential and sigmoidal maturation kinetic for GFP and mCherry, respectively. Our subsequent quantitative experimental analysis revealed a high variance in maturation times independent of the strain studied. In addition, we determined strain dependent maturation times and maturation behaviour. Firstly, FPs expressed by the S and R strain mature on similar average time-scales as opposed to FPs expressed by the C strain. Secondly, dependencies of maturation time with growth conditions are most pronounced in the GFP expressing C strain: Doubling the growth rate of this C strain results in an increased maturation time by a factor of 1. 4. As maturation times can vary even between closely related strains, our data emphasize the importance of profound knowledge of individual strains' maturation times for accurate interpretation of gene expression data...|$|R

Pex 5 p is the Peroxisomal Targeting Signal 1 (PTS 1) receptor and Pex 8 p is an intraperoxisomal protein. Both proteins are essential for PTS 1 protein import and {{have been shown to}} physically interact. We used FCS to analyze the molecular role of this interaction. FCS is a very sensitive technique that allows analysis of dynamic processes of fluorescently <b>marked</b> <b>molecules</b> at equilibrium in a very tiny volume. We used this technique to determine the oligomeric state of both peroxins and to analyze binding of Pex 5 p to PTS 1 peptides and Pex 8 p. HpPex 5 p and HpPex 8 p were overproduced in Escherichia coli, purified by affinity chromatography, and, when required, labeled with the fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 488. FCS measurements revealed that the oligomeric state of HpPex 5 p varied, ranging from monomers at slightly acidic pH to tetramers at neutral pH. HpPex 8 p formed monomers at all pH values tested. Using fluorescein-labeled PTS 1 peptide and unlabeled HpPex 5 p, we established that PTS 1 peptide only bound to tetrameric HpPex 5 p. Upon addition of HpPex 8 p, a heterodimeric complex was formed consisting of one HpPex 8 p and one HpPex 5 p molecule. This process was paralleled by dissociation of PTS 1 peptide from HpPex 5 p, indicating that Pex 8 p may {{play an important role in}} cargo release from the PTS 1 receptor. Our data show that FCS is a powerful technique to explore dynamic physical interactions that occur between peroxins during peroxisomal matrix protein import. ...|$|R
