5|$|Engineering, {{which had}} been taught since 1903, became a {{separate}} school in 1939. In athletics, Duke hosted and competed in the only Rose Bowl ever played outside California in Wallace Wade Stadium in 1942. During World War II, Duke was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that {{took part in the}} V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. In 1963 the Board of Trustees officially desegregated the undergraduate college. Increased activism on campus during the 1960s prompted Martin Luther King Jr. to speak at the University in November 1964 on the progress of the Civil Rights Movement. Following Douglas Knight's resignation from the office of university president, Terry Sanford, the former governor of North Carolina, was elected president of the university in 1969, propelling The Fuqua School of Business' opening, the William R. Perkins library completion, and the founding of the Institute of Policy Sciences and Public Affairs (now the Sanford School of Public Policy). The separate Woman's College merged back with Trinity as the liberal arts college {{for both men and women}} in 1972. Beginning in the 1970s, Duke administrators began a long-term effort to strengthen Duke's reputation both nationally and internationally. Interdisciplinary work was emphasized, as was recruiting <b>minority</b> <b>faculty</b> and students. During this time it also became the birthplace of the first Physician Assistant degree program in the United States. Duke University Hospital was finished in 1980 and the student union building was fully constructed two years later. In 1986 the men's soccer team captured Duke's first National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championship, and the men's basketball team followed shortly thereafter with championships in 1991 and 1992, then again in 2001, 2010, and 2015.|$|E

In 2011 – 2012, despite {{comprising}} 35 % of the US population, minorities comprised 20 % {{of applicants}} to and 15 % of enrolled students in accredited physical therapist education programs.

Little information is available for psychologists who are interested in increasing competence in working with linguistic <b>minorities.</b> <b>Faculty</b> members and graduate students at Indiana University of Pennsylvania were surveyed to determine if training in the areas of Spanish language and working with Latino popu-lations would benefit the university community.

2500|$|In {{response}} to the strategic plan, an Academic Strategic Plan was drafted by Provost Martha Potvin and the deans of the university's colleges in late 2012. The academic plan put maintaining MSU's research funding and activity as its top goal. Other top goals included expanding enrollment by 15 percent by 2019 (to 16,000 students), enhancing research even further, and improving community service by faculty and staff. To achieve the research goal, the plan called for {{increasing the number of}} graduate students by 20 percent, increasing the number of doctoral students by 43 percent, and renovating lab space. Other goals in the plan included improving faculty salaries, improving financial aid to students, enhancing career guidance and counseling to graduating students, hiring more <b>minority</b> <b>faculty</b> (including Native Americans), renovating classrooms, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent, and reducing landfill waste by 25 percent. But comments on the draft academic plan said MSU had no plan to pay for the additional faculty, classrooms, and laboratories that a greatly expanded student body would require. Potvin said the university would pay for them by [...] "prioritizing". A member of the Board of Regents said the plan did not take into account initiatives by the regents or legislature, such as improving the time to graduation (as of 2012 between five and six years).|$|E

40|$|When {{it comes}} to faculty development, {{institutions}} seem to suffer a personality split. While our work as educators is focused on developing either the young or the uninitiated with whom faculty {{spend a great deal}} of time mentoring, leading, encouraging, and counseling, our attitudes toward our colleagues often are grounded in a cult of individualism that can curtail intellectual exchange and even push individuals to seek their professional sustenance outside the home institution. While a department exerts effort to orient new full-time faculty, that effort may not go beyond an introduction to the mechanics of the department and of the institution. While it is certainly necessary to understand the seasonal rhythms and processes of the workplace, acculturation that does not progress beyond mechanics will not encourage the development of a community of teacher/scholars. Nor does a cursory introduction give much recognition to the evolving developmental needs of mature faculty members or to the idiosyncratic situation of women and <b>minorities.</b> <b>Faculty</b> development is, in fact, a complex task and a responsibility most effectively led and encouraged by a department’s chair.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} minority recruitment and growth at two-year {{community colleges in}} the Northeast United States. Two major research questions were formulated to guide the investigation: (1) What factors do community college presidents identify as {{having an impact on}} recruiting <b>minority</b> administrators and <b>faculty</b> members? and (2) What strategies do community college presidents use to recruit <b>minority</b> administrators and <b>faculty</b> members? In addition to the two research questions, profiles of <b>minority</b> administrators and <b>faculty</b> members employed at two-year community colleges in the Northeast United States and the community college presidents participating in the study were developed. This paper particularly targets Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaskan Natives as ethnic/racial groups that are often subjected to differential treatment. Fifty-six community college presidents in the Northeast United States participated in this study. Findings include: (1) 64 % of the presidents were white/Caucasian and had Ph.
