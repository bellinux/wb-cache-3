5|$|From 18211846, the {{district}} attorney would have been appointed; thereafter, the office was elected. <b>Martindale</b> was {{the district}} attorney of Genesee County from 18421844 and again from 18471849. Thus, <b>Martindale</b> himself filed the complaints in People ex rel. Blacksmith v. Tracy and People ex rel. Waldron v. Soper, and his successor, Seth Wakeman (18501855) filed the complaint in New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble. Although <b>Martindale</b> was district attorney when the complaint in Tracy was filed, he lost the election and attempted to litigate the mandamus issue as a private attorney.|$|E

5|$|Still in January, <b>Martindale</b> {{applied to}} the Supreme Court for mandamus, and the court issued an {{alternative}} mandamus (essentially, an order to show cause why peremptory mandamus should not issue) on March 6, 1845, which was served March 25. On April 19, the deadline was extended to the first Tuesday in June. Before the Supreme Court, <b>Martindale</b> was joined by New York Attorney General John Van Buren and opposed by A. Taber and J. L. Brown.|$|E

5|$|Ian Richardson {{was booked}} {{within a minute}} {{of the second half}} {{starting}} for bringing down Kiwomya. Notts County started to come back into the game; <b>Martindale</b> headed wide, Agana and Richardson both had shots blocked during a goalmouth scramble and Tony Battersby had a shot saved over the crossbar by Jonathan Gould, as County tried to equalise during a 20-minute spell of pressure. Between County's chances, Stallard had the opportunity to double City's lead when he capitalised on a slip from Strodder, but Ward saved his effort. However, City went on to double their advantage on 75 minutes. Ormondroyd, who had replaced the injured Hamilton, flicked on a long pass from Richard Huxford with his first touch. His header went across goal to Stallard who volleyed home. Two minutes after the goal, <b>Martindale</b> fired wide for County after a pass from Agana, and with time running out Finnan's long-range shot was deflected for a corner, but from the resulting set-piece, Richardson shot over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|The two {{aboriginal}} title {{cases involving}} indigenous litigants {{to reach the}} Taney Court both involved the Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians and the Tonawanda Reservation, both argued by John H. <b>Martindale</b> (first as the district attorney of Genesee County, New York, then in private practice), and both originated in the New York state courts.|$|E

5|$|During the {{previous}} winter, England had played Australia in the controversial Bodyline series {{in which the}} English bowlers were accused of bowling {{the ball on the}} line of leg stump. The deliveries were often short-pitched with four or five fielders close by on the leg side waiting to catch deflections off the bat. The tactics were difficult for batsmen to counter and were designed to be intimidatory. In the 1933 English season, Bodyline was a sensitive subject. There had already been controversy in the tourists' match against the MCC, during which Constantine and Manny <b>Martindale,</b> another West Indian fast bowler, were criticised in the press for bowling short. Frustrated by a slow pitch which he believed was intended to neutralise his fast bowlers, Grant had ordered Constantine to bowl Bodyline against Yorkshire, and decided to repeat the tactics in the second Test. The West Indies scored 375, of which Constantine made 31. When England replied, several batsmen were discomfited by the Bodyline bowling; Wally Hammond was struck on the chin and retired hurt. Constantine and <b>Martindale</b> bowled up to four short deliveries each over so that the ball rose to head height; occasionally they bowled around the wicket.|$|E
5|$|The {{suit was}} {{originally}} brought by John Blacksmith in 1846. Represented by lawyer John H. <b>Martindale,</b> Blacksmith sued Joseph Fellows and Robert Kendle, {{agents of the}} Land Company, for the torts of assault and battery and trespass, quare clausum fregit, with the sawmill as the locus in quo. Blacksmith's wife and Ely S. Parker (Blacksmith's successor as sachem of the Wolf Clan), together the administrators of Blacksmith's estate, succeeded Blacksmith as plaintiffs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of Mellenville, NY217 intersects with CR9 (Mellenville Road), with NY217 serving as CR9's {{southern}} terminus. NY217 then heads southeast, crossing Claverack Creek and passing Mellenville Union Cemetery to the north {{as well as the}} adjacent Claverack Town Park. The route turns eastward and meets the northern terminus of Roxbury Road as it enters the village of Philmont. Within Philmont, NY217 follows Main Street through {{the center of}} the densely populated village. At an intersection with Maple Street, the highway comes within view of Summit Lake, a small water body in the center of Philmont. Past the lake, NY217 turns northeast once more and intersects with CR11 (<b>Martindale</b> Road) as it leaves the village.|$|E

5|$|The plaintiffs' lawyer John H. <b>Martindale</b> (future New York Attorney General) also {{represented}} {{the interests of}} the Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians in three companion cases in the New York state courts. The third such case, New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble (1858), also reached the Supreme Court, which held that state nonintercourse acts (U.S. state laws prohibiting non-Indians from acquiring Indian lands) are not preempted by the Commerce Clause, the federal Nonintercourse Act, or federal treaties. Ely S. Parker, one of the administrators of the Blacksmith estate, went on to draft the surrender at Appomattox and to become the first indigenous Commissioner of Indian Affairs.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1934–35, Leyland toured the West Indies with an MCC team which lost the four-Test series 2–1. The English batsmen were {{overwhelmed}} by the pace bowlers of the West Indies team, and some MCC players complained that Learie Constantine, Manny <b>Martindale</b> and Leslie Hylton intimidated the visiting batsmen with short-pitched bowling. Leyland played three Tests but scored only 36 runs in six innings. More successful in other first-class games, he scored 347 runs at 21.68 overall, and took 11 wickets. He scored 1,815 runs {{at an average of}} 38.61 in 1935 and took 32 wickets at 25.46. He played in four of the five Tests against South Africa—he missed the third with lumbago—to score 342 runs at 57.00. In the first and fourth Tests, he hit fifties, and in the final match scored 161 runs in 130 minutes, batting quickly throughout. However, England could not force a win, and having lost the second Test, were beaten 1–0 in the series.|$|E

[...] Slant Magazine critic Scott Von Doviak observed that, [...] "Justified's rich vein of gallows humor, convincing sense of place, and twisty hillbilly-noir narratives are all selling points, but it's Olyphant's devilish grin that seals the deal." ...|$|R
