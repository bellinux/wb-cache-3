30|$|When {{tracking}} multiple targets with mobile sensors, {{the approach}} in [3] proposed an active sensing model, whereas the target-sensor association {{is based on}} a nearest neighbor rule which heavily relies on the accuracy of the state estimator while a central processing center is required. The scheme in [18] tackled the problem of <b>moving</b> <b>sensors</b> using a flock control law where all sensors are utilized, while the targets are some of the <b>moving</b> <b>sensors</b> whose position is known. The approach in [19] is utilizing clustering and neural networks to move sensors under the assumption that target locations are available. The scheme in [20] designs a Kalman filtering approach with gradient descent-based kinematic rules under the assumption that it is known which targets every sensor observes bypassing in that way the essential sensor-to-target association step. These schemes involve movement of all sensors at every time instant leading to resource-demanding algorithms that do not exploit spatial locality of the field targets.|$|E

40|$|The motion {{counter and}} trigger module is a module {{which must be}} able to {{determine}} coordinates of a mobile unit according to <b>moving</b> <b>sensors,</b> and to send a serial stream when the mobile unit has reached a determined distance. More precisely, a trigger is generated when the distance has been reached, and consequently a stream is built up and sent through a serial line. Basically, the stream contains calculated coordinates values. This module must be implemented on a hardware-platform composed basically of a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) and a processor. The processor is responsible for fetching the correct instruction for the FPGA processes execution. The <b>moving</b> <b>sensors</b> are incremental encoder wheels, which signals have to be analysed by the FPGA. However, sensors lines mustn 't be directly connected to the hardware-platform connector which is directly linked to the FPGA pins, because there is no voltage security and the FPGA can be destroyed. Therefore a voltage interface has to be developped in order to protect inputs and outputs of the FPGA pins with external elements. Then a VHDL program has to be implemented into the FPGA in order to carry out the motion counter and trigger module. A motion counter module generates the coordinates values, and it has two operation modes: The first one is to calculate coordinates according to <b>moving</b> <b>sensors</b> information, and the second one is to generate emulated coordinates. A trigger module generates a trigger each time a determined distance has been reached, and then a stream can be built up and sent through a serial line. Moreover, a receiver module gets back the serial stream, and stores the deserialized stream data into SRAM. (In this way, a control of sent stream data can be done). A practical case where this motion counter and trigger module is required is a moving unit which need to perform a measurement every ten centimeters. A trigger is generated each time the moving unit has reached ten centimeters, then a stream is sent, and the reception of this stream by an other module initiates a new trigger where measurements can be performed, and data of this measurement could be stored with the corresponding coordinates...|$|E
