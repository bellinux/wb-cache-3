5|$|It {{is thought}} {{that this type of}} {{atmosphere}} loss may be common to all planets orbiting Sun-like stars closer than around 0.1 AU. HD 209458 b will not evaporate entirely, although it may have lost up to about 7% of its mass over its estimated lifetime of 5 billion years. It may be possible that the planet's magnetic field <b>may</b> <b>prevent</b> this loss, because the exosphere would become ionized by the star, and the magnetic field would contain the ions from loss.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 2007, Kurt Jellinek responded on the Slackers website {{by stating}} that the article was sensationalist and misleading. Jellinek said that, of the 44 units the chain had, five were sold on eBay for $399.99, {{with a couple of}} units still in stock, and 35 were held for {{specific}} customers and sold at the MSRP. The remainder were given away. Some sites believe this may violate Nintendo's enforcement of the Wii's $249 retail price, and <b>may</b> <b>prevent</b> the store from receiving future products from Nintendo. Nintendo has refused to comment on the issue.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{in females}} where {{ulceration}} is correlated to the menstrual cycle or to birth control pills, progestogen or {{a change in}} birth control may be beneficial. Use of nicotine replacement therapy {{for people who have}} developed oral ulceration after stopping smoking has also been reported. Starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition. Trauma can be reduced by avoiding rough or sharp foodstuffs and by brushing teeth with care. If sodium lauryl sulfate is suspected to be the cause, avoidance of products containing this chemical may be useful and prevent recurrence in some individuals. Similarly patch testing may indicate that food allergy is responsible, and the diet modified accordingly. If investigations reveal deficiency states, correction of the deficiency may result in resolution of the ulceration. For example, {{there is some evidence that}} vitamin B12 supplementation <b>may</b> <b>prevent</b> recurrence in some individuals.|$|E

5|$|Screening for {{hypothyroidism}} {{is performed}} in the newborn period in many countries, generally using TSH. This {{has led to the}} early identification of many cases and thus the prevention of developmental delay. It is the most widely used newborn screening test worldwide. While TSH-based screening will identify the most common causes, the addition of T4 testing is required to pick up the rarer central causes of neonatal hypothyroidism. If T4 determination is included in the screening done at birth, this will identify cases of congenital hypothyroidism of central origin in 1:16,000 to 1:160,000 children. Considering that these children usually have other pituitary hormone deficiencies, early identification of these cases <b>may</b> <b>prevent</b> complications.|$|E
5|$|To {{conserve}} energy, heterothermic bats during long migrations may {{go into a}} torpid state while roosting in the daytime, {{and flying}} at night. Unlike migratory birds which fly {{during the day and}} feed during the night, nocturnal bats have a conflict between traveling and eating. Using torpor, bats can save around 90% of energy that they would have spent trying to keep their body temperature at a normal level; thereby reducing the need to feed. It also decreases the duration of migration, which <b>may</b> <b>prevent</b> them from spending too much time in unfamiliar places, and decrease predation. Pregnant individuals of some species may not use torpor.|$|E
5|$|On October 28, Persis Khambatta {{was hired}} to portray Ilia. She had been {{required}} to wear a bald cap for her screen test, although {{at this point the}} character also wore elaborate headgear in some footage. Roddenberry was insistent on this as a character attribute, but others such as Eisner hated the idea of a bald female character. His notes said that while a bald female character would be an interesting addition, it <b>may</b> <b>prevent</b> the audience from feeling at ease with Ilia and so the style may need to be given to a different character entirely. The auditions by this time were not held under the pretence that they were to play a part in a television series, but were openly talking about Star Trek becoming a feature film. The casting for Willard Decker had been delayed, both because of a slight delay in the production but also because the writers were no longer sure that the character was needed at all. This was despite auditions being conducted {{at the same time that}} Gautreaux was cast as Xon, during which, in his second audition with Barrett, he also read lines against ten actors competing for the role of Decker.|$|E

5|$|Phimosis is the {{inability}} to retract the foreskin over the glans penis. At birth, the foreskin cannot be retracted due to adhesions between the foreskin and glans, and this is considered normal (physiological phimosis). Over time the foreskin naturally separates from the glans, {{and a majority of}} boys are able to retract the foreskin by age three. Less than one percent are still having problems at age 18. If {{the inability}} to do so becomes problematic (pathological phimosis) circumcision is a treatment option. This pathological phimosis may be due to scarring from the skin disease balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), repeated episodes of balanoposthitis or forced retraction of the foreskin. Steroid creams are also a reasonable option and <b>may</b> <b>prevent</b> the need for surgery including in those with mild BXO. The procedure may also be used to prevent the development of phimosis. Phimosis is also a complication that can result from circumcision.|$|E
5|$|While a small {{minority}} of cockroaches are associated with human habitats and viewed as repugnant by many people, a few species are of conservation concern. The Lord Howe Island wood-feeding cockroach (Panesthia lata) is listed as endangered by the New South Wales Scientific Committee, but the cockroach may be extinct on Lord Howe Island itself. The introduction of rats, the spread of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) and fires are possible reasons for their scarcity. Two species are currently listed as endangered and critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, Delosia ornata and Nocticola gerlachi. Both cockroaches have a restricted distribution and are threatened by habitat loss and rising sea levels. Only 600 Delosia ornata adults and 300 nymphs are known to exist, and these are threatened by a hotel development. No action has been taken to save the two cockroach species, but protecting their natural habitats <b>may</b> <b>prevent</b> their extinction. In the former Soviet Union, cockroach populations have been declining at an alarming rate; this may be exaggerated, or the phenomenon may be temporary or cyclic. One species of roach, Simandoa conserfariam is considered extinct in the wild.|$|E
