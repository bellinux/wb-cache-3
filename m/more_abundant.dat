5|$|Iridium {{is one of}} {{the nine}} least {{abundant}} stable elements in Earth's crust, having an average mass fraction of 0.001ppm in crustal rock; gold is 40 times <b>more</b> <b>abundant,</b> platinum is 10 times <b>more</b> <b>abundant,</b> and silver and mercury are 80 times <b>more</b> <b>abundant.</b> Tellurium is about as abundant as iridium. In contrast to its low abundance in crustal rock, iridium is relatively common in meteorites, with concentrations of 0.5ppm or more. The overall concentration of iridium on Earth is thought to be much higher than what is observed in crustal rocks, but because of the density and siderophilic ("iron-loving") character of iridium, it descended below the crust and into Earth's core when the planet was still molten.|$|E

5|$|Rubidium is {{approximately}} as abundant as zinc and <b>more</b> <b>abundant</b> than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, zinnwaldite, and lepidolite, {{although none of}} these contain only rubidium and no other alkali metals. Caesium is <b>more</b> <b>abundant</b> than some commonly known elements, such as antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, but is much less abundant than rubidium.|$|E
40|$|Spotted fever is {{recognized}} worldwide as a reemerging public health problem. In Campinas region, state of São Paulo, the transmission area has expanded {{and the number}} of positive cases has increased in the lastest years. In these region most cases are usually related to the increased number of capybaras, which are one of the main primary hosts for the tick Amblyomma cajennense. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the seasonal dynamic of larvaes, nymphs and adults of Amblyomma species in a gallery forest. From November 2000 to October 2002 free-living ticks were collected using carbon dioxid traps. Larvae of Amblyomma spp were abundant during almost all months. Nymphs of Amblyomma spp occurred during the whole year and were <b>more</b> <b>abundants</b> from July to December. Adults of A. cajennense were <b>more</b> <b>abundants</b> during the spring-summer months. Adults of A. dubitatum showed higher populational peaks from August to February...|$|R

5|$|Sponges are <b>more</b> <b>abundant</b> {{but less}} diverse in {{temperate}} waters than in tropical waters, possibly because organisms that prey on sponges are <b>more</b> <b>abundant</b> in tropical waters. Glass sponges {{are the most}} common in polar waters and in the depths of temperate and tropical seas, as their very porous construction enables them to extract food from these resource-poor waters with the minimum of effort. Demosponges and calcareous sponges are abundant and diverse in shallower non-polar waters.|$|E

5|$|Locusts are the {{swarming}} {{phase of}} certain species of short-horned grasshoppers {{in the family}} Acrididae. These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances become <b>more</b> <b>abundant</b> and change their behaviour and habits, becoming gregarious.|$|E
5|$|A 1996, {{researchers}} {{showed that}} the black-throated blue warbler prefers to reside in hardwood forests with higher shrub densities where food is <b>more</b> <b>abundant</b> compared to lower shrub density plots. Within these high shrub density habitats, {{not only is there}} a higher density of warblers, but the population age average is also older, being composed of males and females who are at least two years of age.|$|E
5|$|Although {{rubidium}} is <b>more</b> <b>abundant</b> in Earth's crust than caesium, {{the limited}} applications {{and the lack}} of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year. Several methods are available for separating potassium, rubidium, and caesium. The fractional crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2·12H2O yields after 30 subsequent steps pure rubidium alum. Two other methods are reported, the chlorostannate process and the ferrocyanide process.|$|E

30|$|Importantly, we do {{not know}} if hares in Glacier NP show the high interannual {{variation}} that has been observed in time series of some other southern range snowshoe hare populations (Hodges 2000 b). If hares in Glacier NP show high variation in density through time, it is possible that our sampling happened to fall during a period of overall low densities. We expect that the major patterns in mature forest habitat use that we observed would remain true, but we might well see more habitats used when hares are <b>more</b> generally <b>abundant.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The form of Salvia reptans {{commonly}} {{grown in}} gardens {{is unusual in}} that it produces numerous lax or decumbent stems. The other form, which is native to western Texas and is not cultivated, grows upright to 3 feet in height. The variety S. reptans var. glabra also grows wild in Texas. In horticulture, Salvia reptans reaches 3 feet wide or <b>more</b> with <b>abundant</b> thin, black stems. The stems can make a groundcover. The narrow mistletoe-green leaves are sparse. The [...]5 inch flowers have blue corollas in dark calyces.|$|R
5|$|Amanita exitialis {{is similar}} to A.bisporigera, a species {{originally}} described by George Francis Atkinson from the United States. In comparison to A.exitialis, A.bisporigera differs by its lower placement of the ring on the stem, smaller spores (typically 8–9.5 by 7–8.5µm), and different structure of the volva. American specimens of A.bisporigera have <b>more</b> <b>abundant</b> inflated cells than that of A.exitialis. Two other white Asian species, A.oberwinklerana and A.subjunquillea var. alba also resemble A.exitialis, but are four-spored.|$|E
5|$|Carex binervis has an oceanic distribution, {{occurring}} only {{in areas}} of high rainfall, from Finland and Norway, through the British Isles, Germany, Belgium and France, to Spain and Portugal.

50|$|The results {{they found}} {{do not support}} IFD {{predictions}} and some take this outcome to mean that the current model is too simple. Animal behaviorists have proposed a modification to the model that denotes an ultimate outcome of a population always having more individuals on the least profitable site and less on the <b>more</b> resource <b>abundant</b> site. Knowledge of the competitive interactions, effects of travel between sites, number of animals in population, perceptual abilities of these animals, and the relative and absolute resource availability on each patch is required to accurately predict the distribution of a foraging population.|$|R

Such coastal groups were <b>more</b> <b>abundant</b> in pre-whaling days.|$|E
5|$|Luminous {{infrared}} galaxies or LIRGs are galaxies with luminosities, {{the measurement}} of brightness, above 1011 L☉. LIRGs are <b>more</b> <b>abundant</b> than starburst galaxies, Seyfert galaxies and quasi-stellar objects at comparable total luminosity. Infrared galaxies emit more energy in the infrared than at all other wavelengths combined. A LIRG's luminosity is 100 billion times that of our Sun.|$|E

40|$|Preliminary version, {{please do}} not {{circulate}} This paper investigates the determinants of the voting behavior of US representatives on immigration policy in the period 1970 - 2006. Our findings suggest that representatives from <b>more</b> skilled labor <b>abundant</b> districts are <b>more</b> likely to support an open immigration policy towards the unskilled, while representatives from <b>more</b> unskilled labor <b>abundant</b> districts {{are less likely to}} do so. Our evidence is robust to the introduction of additional economic controls, which capture the size of the welfare state and to a wealth of other ideological and non economic characteristics of the district. This paper thus represents the natural counterpart, in a democratic government setting like the one of the United States, to the findings of the literature on individual attitudes towards immigration, which has also highlighted the crucial importance of the labor market/economic channel in explaining individual preferences towards immigration...|$|R
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} silver {{is composed}} of two stable isotopes, 107Ag and 109Ag, with 107Ag being slightly <b>more</b> <b>abundant</b> (51.839% natural abundance). This almost equal abundance is rare in the periodic table. The atomic weight is 107.8682(2) u; this value is very important because {{of the importance of}} silver compounds, particularly halides, in gravimetric analysis. Both isotopes of silver are produced in stars via the s-process (slow neutron capture), as well as in supernovas via the r-process (rapid neutron capture).|$|E
5|$|Potassium is {{the eighth}} or ninth most common element by mass (0.2%) {{in the human}} body, so that a 60kg adult {{contains}} {{a total of about}} 120g of potassium.

They do suggest, however, that members of the genus were formerly more widespread.|$|E
5000|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that some special interest groups lobby for less immigration for their own group and more immigration for other groups since they see effects of immigration, such as increased labor competition, as detrimental when affecting their own group but beneficial when impacting other groups. A 2010 European study suggested that [...] "employers {{are more likely to}} be pro-immigration than employees, provided that immigrants are thought to compete with employees who are already in the country. Or else, when immigrants are thought to compete with employers rather than employees, employers {{are more likely to be}} anti-immigration than employees." [...] A 2011 study examining the voting of US representatives on migration policy suggests that [...] "representatives from <b>more</b> skilled labor <b>abundant</b> districts are <b>more</b> likely to support an open immigration policy towards the unskilled, whereas the opposite is true for representatives from <b>more</b> unskilled labor <b>abundant</b> districts." ...|$|R
