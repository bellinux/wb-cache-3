5|$|Air {{conditioning}} – Ambulances {{are often}} {{fitted with a}} separate air conditioning system to serve the working area from that which serves the cab. This helps to <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> appropriate temperature for any patients being treated, but may also feature additional features such as filtering against airborne pathogens.|$|E
5|$|BBRC aims to <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> {{accurate}} {{database of}} {{the occurrence of}} rare taxa in Britain, in order to enable individuals or organisations to assess the current status of, and any changes in, the patterns of occurrence and distribution of these taxa in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to hydrostatic equilibrium, {{the interior of}} a stable star will also <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> energy balance of thermal equilibrium. There is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior that results in a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior. The outgoing flux of energy leaving any layer within the star will exactly match the incoming flux from below.|$|E

5|$|Moult is {{prolonged}} in all tubenoses, since they must <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> ability to fly. Northern populations start replacing their plumage after those further south, reflecting the later start to their breeding season. Birds in a Welsh colony commenced moulting in early August, while populations in northern Spain and the Balearics started in early July and mid-June respectively. Breeding birds moult later than non-breeders.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Godfrey put Fleming {{in charge}} of Operation Goldeneye between 1941 and 1942; Goldeneye was a plan to <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> {{intelligence}} framework in Spain {{in the event of}} a German takeover of the territory. Fleming's plan involved maintaining communication with Gibraltar and launching sabotage operations against the Nazis. In 1941 he liaised with Donovan over American involvement in a measure intended to ensure that the Germans did not dominate the seaways.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{make their}} homes within holes in various {{mangrove}} trees and <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> arboreal existence whereas the young are strictly terrestrial {{for the first}} year of their lives. As the Utila iguana cannot successfully lay its eggs in the mangrove swamps, the gravid females are forced to migrate to nearby sandy beaches in order to bury their clutches of eggs so they can incubate in the hot sun. After digging their nest burrows and laying their eggs, the females abandon the nests and return to the mangroves. Sixty to seventy-four days later the hatchlings emerge and move back to the swamps.|$|E

5|$|Although figs flower asynchronously as a population, in {{most species}} {{flowering}} is synchronised within an individual. Newly emerged female wasps must {{move away from}} their natal tree {{in order to find}} figs in which to lay their eggs. This is to the advantage of the fig, since it prevents self-pollination. In Florida, individual F. aurea trees flower and fruit asynchronously. Within-tree asynchrony in flowering is likely to raise the probability of self-pollination, but it may be an adaptation that allows the species to <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> adequate population of wasps at low population densities or in strongly seasonal climates.|$|E
5|$|An air-cuticle {{multilayer}} in {{the scales}} creates optical interference. Each scale contains cuticle layers with randomly located blocks of cuticle that {{hold them in}} place and <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> air gap between them. The layers and air gaps are narrower than the wavelength of visible light. The structure varies from one layer at the proximal end of each scale, to about six layers at the distal end. This multilayer structure strongly reflects certain wavelengths of light, which {{are determined by the}} thicknesses of the layers and the angle at which the light hits the scale.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1990, Chicago Bridge & Iron and Wormald International {{had both}} sold their shares in ASC. The shares were bought up by Kockums and the Australian Industry Development Corporation, with some of Kockums' shares then sold to James Hardie Industries to <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> Australian {{majority}} ownership of the company. On 5 April 2000, the shares in ASC held by Kockums were bought out and the company was nationalised, despite a trend {{at the time to}} privatise government-owned companies. At the end of 2003, a contract to maintain the Collins class worth $3.5billion over 25years was awarded to ASC.|$|E

The Library of Virginia in Richmond, Virginia also maintains microforms of {{issues of the}} Virginia Argus dating from 1852, 1853, 1856, 1857, and 1859.|$|E
5|$|For acute {{cases in}} the leg, the ACCP {{recommended}} a parenteral anticoagulant (such as LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin) {{for at least five}} days and a VKA, the oral anticoagulant, the same day. LMWH and fondaparinux are suggested over unfractionated heparin, but both are retained in those with compromised kidney function, unlike unfractionated heparin. The VKA is generally taken for a minimum of three months to <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> international normalized ratio of 2.0–3.0, with 2.5 as the target. The benefit of taking a VKA declines as the duration of treatment extends, and the risk of bleeding increases with age.|$|E
5|$|Frank Elgyn (Michael Wincott), the Betty captain, is Sabra Hillard's lover. Elgyn has {{an illegal}} {{partnership}} with General Martin Perez {{in which he}} delivers materials off the books to expedite the Auriga research and other activities. Elgyn delivers a shipment of humans in cryostasis, which are used as incubators for the Aliens. Elgyn and Perez <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> understanding {{that there will be}} no disruptive activity aboard the station. This agreement is later compromised by Call by her contact with Ripley 8. Shortly after the Aliens escape captivity, Elgyn is killed when one of them pulls him through floor grates and impales him.|$|E

5|$|Males of fly {{species such}} as Cuterebra, many hover flies, bee flies (Bombyliidae) and fruit flies (Tephritidae) {{maintain}} territories within which they engage in aerial pursuit to drive away intruding males and other species. While these territories may be held by individual males, some species form leks with many males aggregating in displays. Some flies <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> airspace and still others form dense swarms that maintain a stationary location with respect to landmarks. Many flies mate in flight while swarming.|$|E
5|$|Obesity is most {{commonly}} {{caused by a}} combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental disorder. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts due to the energy required to <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> increased body mass.|$|E

Quarterback Todd Reesing was the key contributor to the Kansas aerial attack, completing 20of his 37passes for 227yards and just one interception. The only other Kansas player to record passing yards was running back Brandon McAnderson, who threw a 22-yard first-down pass during a fake punt. Though under pressure {{for much of the}} game—Reesing was sacked four times—Kansas continued to <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> effective pass attack throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|Once he {{returned}} to Nigeria, Achebe was promoted at the NBS {{to the position of}} Director of External Broadcasting. One of his first duties was to help create the Voice of Nigeria network. The station broadcast its first transmission on New Year's Day 1962, and worked to <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> objective perspective during the turbulent era immediately following independence. This objectivity was put to the test when Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa {{declared a state of emergency}} in the Western Region, responding to a series of conflicts between officials of varying parties. Achebe became saddened by the evidence of corruption and silencing of political opposition.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the terms}} of the Treaty of Versailles, which had been in place since the end of World War I, stated that Germany was not allowed to <b>maintain</b> <b>an</b> air force.
