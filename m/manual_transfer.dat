40|$|This article {{approaches}} {{the option of}} logging lifting activities by nurses in patient care. Practical problems in nursing limit the use of direct observation and measurements to assess exposure to lifting in real life settings. Indications were found that logs registering the frequency of manual handling could be an option in nursing. The development of a log is accounted for and its use during an intervention, introducing 40 patient hoists in home care, is described. The exposure to manual handling was reduced significantly in the intervention group (average number of patient transfers per nurse/week (ptn/w) 35 - 21). The control group remained stable (ptn/w 24 - 24). The reduction of exposure was only {{partly due to the}} hoists substituting <b>manual</b> <b>transfers,</b> suggesting the presence of an eliminating effect. Possible explanations indicating that the hoists were partly responsible for this are: 1. The patients' relatives could now perform the transfers with the hoists; 2. Hoists combine several <b>manual</b> <b>transfers</b> into one mechanical transfer; 3. Hoists require only one operator for <b>manual</b> <b>transfers</b> that require two nurses; The log pointed to unpredicted elimination effects in addition to the substitution effects, and provided detailed information for evaluating the intervention. Relevance to industry: Assessment of exposure to manual handling, using a frequency-oriented log, appears to provide relevant information for designing back pain prevention policies in nursing. Insight is given into the effects fo an intervention using hoists. With some adaptions, the log could monitor ergonomic policies in nursing practice on a routine basis. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the release at the source and potential for exposure to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in an industrial pilot plant. Various operations had been investigated: cleaning of the gas phase reactor, filling bins with MWCNTs powder, hot compounding of MWCNT-containing polymer composites and dry cutting of the composites into mm-sized pellets. In addition, <b>manual</b> <b>transferring</b> and sieving of MWCNTs have been examined with the intention of investigating a worst case potential exposure scenario. The activities were operated in normal conditions, with the exception of the simulation of the worst case scenario of <b>manual</b> <b>transferring</b> and weighing for which extreme precautionary principles were adopted. Background conditions were determined in parallel. Overall particle concentration levels, size distributions were not significantly different for the reactor cleanout and filling bins operations from the background aerosol that could be attributed to the outside air that fed the workplace atmosphere. The hot compounding and dry cutting processes resulted in particle concentration levels and size distributions significantly different from the background. Besides polymer fragments and carbonaceous aggregates, few possible polymer fragments containing MWCNTs were observed on EM micrographs of aerosol samples collected close to the source. The results obtained during the <b>manual</b> <b>transferring</b> and sieving as a worst case potential exposure scenario demonstrate an association between the activity and the increase of the particle concentration and the modification of the size distribution. EM micrographs indicated that MWCNTs existed mainly as bundles whose size ranged from approximately a few 100 nm to 10 µm...|$|R

During the <b>manual</b> <b>transfer</b> of powder dyes from bulk containers to smaller process containers, significant amounts of dust can be generated. Worker exposure to dye dust through breathing or skin contact can result in asthma, eczema, and severe allergic reactions. Certain dyes may also be carcinogens.

A vertical air shower pushes airborne dust out of the breathing zone of the worker until the dust is captured and exhausted.
