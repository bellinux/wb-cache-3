5|$|By early February {{the program}} coding {{switched}} from legal pads to the PDP-10 and a preliminary version {{was completed by}} March 1975. Gates and Allen had {{been in contact with}} Roberts and MITS and the older looking Paul Allen would travel to Albuquerque in March. MITS needed <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get a computer with 7k bytes of memory working, and they needed <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get the software finished. When Allen arrived at MITS it took a day to get the software running; Allen remembers this being caused by computer memory problems while Roberts remembers the delay was due to software problems.|$|E
5|$|During the {{shooting}} in the wind tunnel Craig and Kurylenko wore wind-resistant contact lenses that enabled them to open their eyes as they fell. For safety and comfort, they only shot for 30 seconds at a time. Forster wished he had <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> work on the free-fall scene.|$|E

5|$|NeXT {{computers}} were first released on the retail market in 1990, for $9,999. NeXT's original investor Ross Perot {{resigned from the}} board of directors in June 1991 to dedicate <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> Perot Systems, a Plano, Texas-based systems integrator.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, 2006, Gates {{announced}} {{that over the}} next two years he would transition out of his day-to-day role to dedicate <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed Ray Ozzie in charge of day-to-day management and Craig Mundie in charge of long-term product strategy.|$|E

5|$|The {{issue of}} the double burden is {{exacerbated}} in Asian countries due to the large cultural norm of women doing care work held by both men and women. In many developed countries, women drop out of work when they have children {{in order to have}} <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> take care of them.|$|E
5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> care for the nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|After Gemini 7, Kraft {{stepped back}} from his work at Mission Control, {{allowing}} other flight directors {{to take charge of}} the remaining missions so that he could devote <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> planning for the Apollo program. He served on two review boards at North American Aviation, the contractor responsible for the Apollo capsule. Yet Kraft still felt pangs at not being {{at the center of the}} action, particularly after the emergency re-entry of Gemini 8. Both astronauts and mission controllers had made the right decisions, but, as Kraft confessed to Robert Gilruth, he found himself wishing that he had been the one on the spot.|$|E

5|$|After several {{damaging}} air attacks, {{the naval}} surface combatants from both America and Japan {{withdrew from the}} battle area without either side securing a clear victory. However, the U.S. and its allies gained tactical and strategic advantage. Japan's losses were greater and included dozens of aircraft and their experienced aircrews. Also, Japanese reinforcements intended for Guadalcanal were delayed and eventually delivered by warships rather than transport ships, giving the Allies <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> prepare for the Japanese counteroffensive and preventing the Japanese from landing heavy artillery, ammunition, and other supplies.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{construction}} and reconstruction work resumed on the A3 motorway. The battle damage {{was the first}} to be addressed, along with removal of the trenches excavated in the flyover embankments. Similarly, unexploded ordnance and minefields left around the motorway had to be removed by minesweepers. The motorway pavement was seriously deteriorated, as evidenced by extensive ruts and cracks incurred during the four-year wartime period. Unlike repairs made to the viaducts and flyovers, mine clearance and pavement reconstruction took considerably <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> perform.|$|E
5|$|At the Nintendo Media Conference at E3 2007, it was {{announced}} by Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé that Super Smash Bros.

However, just 2 months before its anticipated December release, the development team asked for <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> work on the game. During the Nintendo Conference on October 10, 2007, Nintendo Co., Ltd. president Iwata announced the delay.|$|E

5|$|Besides meditation, Luang Pu Sodh {{promoted}} {{the study of}} Buddhism as well. In this combination {{he was one of}} the pioneers in Thai Buddhism. In 1939, Luang Pu Sodh set up a Pali Institute at Wat Paknam, which is said to have cost 2.5 million baht. Luang Pu Sodh financed the building through the production of amulets, which is common in Thai Buddhism. The kitchen which he built was the fulfillment of an intention which he had since his first years at Wat Pho, when he experienced difficulty in finding food. It also resulted in monks having <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> study the Dhamma.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} years of the 20th century, Boyce had become a multi-millionaire and had taken a step back from his {{businesses}} to pursue his interests in civic affairs, devoting <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> traveling and participating in expeditions. In 1909, he embarked on a two-month trip to Europe and a large photographic expedition to Africa with photographer George R. Lawrence and cartoonist John T. McCutcheon. Over the next two decades, Boyce led expeditions to South America, Europe, and North Africa, where he visited the newly discovered tomb of King Tutankhamun.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{patterns}} of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well. The three body scatter spike is an example. This {{is the result}} of energy from the radar hitting hail and being deflected to the ground, where they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar. The energy took <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> go from the hail to the ground and back, as opposed to the energy that went direct from the hail to the radar, and the echo is further away from the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path, forming a cone of weaker reflectivities.|$|E

5|$|Chiang {{ran into}} stiff {{opposition}} from his officers, including the powerful Chief of Staff of the Military Affairs Commission He Yingqin, the Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi, {{the head of}} the Fifth War Zone Li Zongren, and his German advisor Alexander von Falkenhausen. They argued that the Chinese Army needed <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> recover from its losses at Shanghai, and pointed out that Nanking was highly indefensible topographically. The mostly gently sloping terrain in front of Nanking would make it easy for the attackers to advance on the city, while the Yangtze River behind Nanking would cut off the defenders' retreat.|$|E
5|$|Closed-circuit: A second rebreather {{containing}} one or {{more independent}} diving cylinders for its gas supply. Using another rebreather as a bail-out is possible but uncommon. Although the long duration of rebreathers seems compelling for bail-out, rebreathers are relatively bulky, complex, vulnerable to damage and require <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> start breathing from, than easy-to-use, instantly available, robust and reliable open-circuit equipment.|$|E
5|$|Constantine met {{his future}} wife, Norma Agatha Cox, in 1921. She had little {{interest}} in cricket and, although their relationship developed during the early 1920s, she resented that he gave <b>more</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> cricket than he did to her. However, the relationship lasted and she began to take more of an interest in his sporting achievements. They were married on 25 July 1927; their only child, Gloria, was born in April 1928. Throughout their marriage, his wife motivated him to continue his efforts to further his career and they remained close. Norma died two months after her husband in 1971.|$|E
