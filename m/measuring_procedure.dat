5000|$|Arabic {{poetry is}} {{categorized}} into two main types, rhymed or measured, and prose, {{with the former}} greatly preceding the latter. The rhymed poetry falls within fifteen different meters collected and explained by al-Farahidi in The Science of ‘Arud. Al-Akhfash, a student of al-Farahidi, later added one more meter to make them sixteen. The meters of the rhythmical poetry are known in Arabic as [...] "seas" [...] (buḥūr). The measuring unit of seas is known as [...] "taf‘īlah", and every sea contains {{a certain number of}} taf'ilas which the poet has to observe in every verse (bayt) of the poem. The <b>measuring</b> <b>procedure</b> of a poem is very rigorous. Sometimes adding or removing a consonant or a vowel can shift the bayt from one meter to another. Also, in rhymed poetry, every bayt has to end with the same rhyme (qāfiyah) throughout the poem.|$|E

He quit the latter in 1935 (after the Night of the Long Knives). Little else is known about his political involvement during this period because his name {{does not appear in}} the 200,000-page records recovered from the Nazi Party Chancellery. He gained the Dr. med. degree in 1938. During his studies he was also an assistant at the Institute of Colloid Research at Frankfurt under Raphael Eduard Liesegang. In 1937 Knöll started cooperating with Jenaer Glaswerk Schott and Gen. which developed all-glass bacterial filters. He developed an accurate <b>measuring</b> <b>procedure</b> for checking the filters. In return the company offered him the opportunity to establish and manage its bacterial lab - a full-time job Knöll began in November 1938. At the glass works he established a still existing collection of defined strains of different microorganisms as basis for filter checking.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze and}} compare the angular {{deviations}} for an optical beam reflected by and transmitted through a dielectric triangular prism. The analytic expressions derived for the angular deviations hold for arbitrary incidence angles. For incidence approaching {{the internal and external}} Brewster angles, the angular deviations transverse magnetic waves present the same behavior leading to the well-known giant Goos-Haenchen angular shift. For incidence near the critical angle a new region of large shift is seen both for transverse magnetic and transverse electric waves. While a direct <b>measuring</b> <b>procedure</b> is better {{in the vicinity of the}} Brewster region, a weak measurement breaks off the giant Goos-Haenchen effect, preserving the amplification in the critical region. We discuss under which conditions it is possible to optimize the amplification and we also determine when a weak measurement is preferred to a direct <b>measuring</b> <b>procedure.</b> Comment: 28 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

40|$|A new {{technique}} for near-surface electromagnetic measurements {{is currently being}} developed [Radic, 1994], {{which is based on}} purely magnetic measurements up to the MHz frequency range. Up to a factor the vertical derivatives of the horizontal magnetical fields can be used to replace the electrical fields in plane-wave methods. These derivatives are difficult to determine at low frequencies, but are large enough to be measured in the frequency range considered. Three-dimensional modeling - mainly based on the well-known code of Mackie et al. [1993] - was used to answer several questions concerning this technique. As the derivative is to be determined in a vertical hole, the <b>measuring</b> <b>procedure</b> itself may introduce a distortion of the fields. It was shown that this effect is significant and has {{to be taken into account}} in the design of the sensor and/or the <b>measuring</b> <b>procedure.</b> Other modeling projects included: (1) the resolution of the method as compared with more traditional techniques [...] ...|$|E
