[...] Largely unimpressed by the exhibition as a whole, Smith wrote that [...] "the painting that <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sense</b> is Waiting for the Barbarians, in which a Minotaur, or a man dressed as one, is taken to a small stage, like Christ before the people, while another burns at the stake."

50|$|James had {{a strong}} opinion about these schools of thought. He was, by nature, a pragmatist and thus took the view that one should use {{whatever}} parts of theories <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sense</b> and can be proven. Therefore, he recommended breaking apart spiritualism and associationism and using the parts of them that <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sense.</b> James believed that each person has a soul, which exists in a spiritual universe, and leads a person to perform the behaviors {{they do in the}} physical world. James was influenced by Emanuel Swedenborg, who first introduced him to this idea. James stated that, although it does appear that humans use associations to move from one event to the next, this cannot be done without this soul tying everything together. For, after an association has been made, it is the person who decides which part of it to focus on, and therefore determines in which direction following associations will lead. Associationism is too simple in that it does not account for decision-making of future behaviors, and memory of what worked well and what did not. Spiritualism, however, does not demonstrate actual physical representations for how associations occur. James combined the views of spiritualism and associationism to create his own way of thinking.|$|R

50|$|Constraint theory {{stipulates}} {{that the concept}} that results from an attempt at conceptual combination is controlled by three constraints known as diagnosticity, plausibility and informativeness. Diagnosticity refers to the a complex concept's possession of the defining properties of its component simple concepts. Because such properties are diagnostic of the component concepts, {{at least some of}} them should be diagnostic of the higher-order representations constructed from those concepts. Plausibility refers to consistency with existing knowledge and prior experience. It is based on the assumption that a complex concept should be reasonably relevant to the context in which it is used. This assumption <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sense</b> in a practical, linguistic context, particularly when a speaker is catering to the understanding of the listener. Informativeness is the property of having more meaning or properties than any individual component. If a complex concept were not distinguishable from any given component, it would be identical to that component. Because nothing can logically be both a component of something and the totality of something simultaneously, a complex concept must at least be the sum of its parts. Many argue that the interaction among component concepts should allow a complex concept to be greater than that sum. If multiple possible ways to structure or interpret a complex concept exist, the one which best satisfies or most satisfies these constraints is the one which will be used. The paradigm upon which constraint theory is based is computational, and therefore views the mind as a processor which operates on the basis of standard problem-solving protocols (i.e. algorithms and heuristics).|$|E
50|$|According {{to ancient}} Greek poets, Memnon's father Tithonus was {{snatched}} away from Troy by {{the goddess of}} dawn Eos and {{was taken to the}} ends of the earth on the coast of Oceanus. This literally means he was carried by the east wind and was driven to the western ends of the earth beyond the Ocean or Pillars of Hercules. According to Hesiod Eos bore to Tithonus bronzed armed Memnon, the King of the Ethiopians and lordly Emathion. Zephyrus, god of the west wind, like Memnon was also the first-born son of Eos (east wind) by another father Astraeus, making him the brother of Memnon. According to Quintus Smyrnaeus, Memnon said himself that he was raised by the Hesperides on the coast of Oceanus. Memnon dwelling on the western Ocean and his father being driven there would make him the son of dawn (the east) as in the son of Troy rather than the son of eastern Asia as earlier scholars have proposed based on their opinion. Hesiod makes it clear that the son of Dawn (east) originally means west, making Memnon a colonist (son) from the east and king of the west. And this actually <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sense,</b> because as Eos the Dawn Goddess rises from the east before her father Hyperion (the sun) she journeys to the western ends of the earth were she and her father the Sun God sleeps. To the knowledge of the Greeks the farthest west ended at the land of Atlas towards the Hesperides on the African coast south of the Atlantic Ocean. There is a statue of Memnon west of Luxor in Egypt known today as the Colossi of Memnon. According to the ancient Greek historians this statue of Memnon made a sound at morning time that meant Memnon was speaking to his mother Dawn as she rises in the east while he dwells in the west, making him the son of dawn (east) and ruler of the west.|$|E

One potential shortcoming of this form of representation is interunion conflict associated with ongoing competition between unions trying to attract each other's members in the same bargaining units. However, interview evidence collected from union executives in New Zealand, where non-majority, non-exclusive representation already exists, suggests that such conflict is normally limited. Focusing representation on areas that <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sense</b> (for both unions and workers) and following union federation protocols, when conflicts occur, have both contributed to the overall low conflict level.
