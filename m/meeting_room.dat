5|$|Mary Tudor, {{daughter}} of Catherine of Aragon and Henry VIII, spent 19 months at Ludlow overseeing the Council of the Marches between 1525 and 1528, {{along with her}} entourage of servants, advisors, and guardians. The relatively small sum of £5 was spent restoring the castle before her arrival. The council's wide ranging role was reinforced in legislation in 1534, and its purpose was further elaborated in the Act of Union of 1543; some presidents, such as Bishop Rowland Lee, used its harsher powers extensively to execute local criminals, but later presidents typically preferred to punish with the pillory, whipping or imprisonment in the castle. The Great Chamber itself {{was used as the}} council's <b>meeting</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
5|$|Salem Chapel {{stands on}} land {{which had been}} part of the old Napoleonic Barrack Ground. Hence the name for the nearby Waterloo Road. The land was {{auctioned}} in 1839, and in the following year the purchaser, a Mr George Gould, himself a Baptist, sold two plots fronting the London Road for the erection of a Baptist Chapel. The land was purchased and fenced for the sum of £300 which was raised by way of a mortgage. The original <b>meeting</b> <b>room,</b> (now the Church Parlour) was built and opened in July 1840. The present chapel was completed and opened in 1847.|$|E
5|$|The {{chapter house}} has 40sedilia lining its walls, {{and may have}} {{originally}} provided seating for more when it was the <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> for the abbey community. In 1714 it was refurbished to become a library, and its floor was raised by about 1m (3ft). Its east end was damaged in the Bristol riots of 1831, requiring considerable restoration, {{and at that time}} or later the library furnishings were removed. In 1832, when the floor was lowered again, a Saxon stone panel depicting the Harrowing of Hell was found underneath. The discovery of the stone provides strong evidence that there was a church or shrine on the site before Robert Fitzharding founded the Abbey in 1140.|$|E

The client represents the governmental paper {{interests of the}} branch's entire surrounding county, and it is mentioned that taking him on could mean Dunder-Mifflin {{will not have to}} close one of its branches – a threat that had been looming for the past year. Jan is initially disgusted with Michael's antics (which began with Michael changing the meeting location from a hotel <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> to Chili's without permission) and refusal to talk business, but discovers {{at the end of the}} day that there is a method to his madness when the client bonds with Michael, allowing him to close the deal. Afterwards, in the parking lot, Michael and the recently divorced Jan kiss and leave together.|$|E
5|$|The most {{decorated}} room in {{the building}} is the Sala Nobile (Noble Hall) on the first floor, which was originally a courthall, and which is now used as a <b>meeting</b> <b>room.</b> Here the judge and the nominated College of Advocates sat on a bench, which itself was a platform, wearing typical silk gown clothing of the period. The advocates on the bench were nominated and removed {{at the discretion of}} the Grand Master. When Malta was a British colony a similar short lived system was adopted, on 14 August 1832, known as the King's Counsel. The bench consisted of the Advocates of the King, and survived seven years. This room has coats-of-arms of the Castellani depicted on the upper side of the walls. There are 105 coats-of-arms, belonging to the Castellani from 1609 to the last in 1798, after which the position was abolished.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} wooden {{church building}} was moved again in 1909 and extended in 1928 {{for use as}} a community hall. It had a kitchen extension added in 1955 and a kindergarten room in 1958. The split paling cladding was replaced with weatherboards in the 1900s. The roof was replaced with iron, probably in 1914 when the brick church was also re-roofed in iron. The interior paling lining of the old wooden church was covered with pine sheeting in the late 1930s. This building {{has been used as a}} church for seven years, more than sixty years as a <b>meeting</b> <b>room</b> and community centre and more than seventy years as a day and Sunday school. After the school moved to a new building in 1929 the old building remained in use as a Sunday school.|$|E
