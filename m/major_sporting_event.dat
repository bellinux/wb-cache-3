40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{economic}} impact assessment of six <b>major</b> <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> held in the UK in 1997. <b>Major</b> <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> are now regarded by many cities as a significant part of their tourism strategy. However, staging a <b>major</b> <b>sports</b> <b>event</b> normally involves the host city making a contribution to the costs. Whether such a contribution is justified depends on the economic benefits generated in the local economy. The results reported in this paper indicate the wide variability in such benefits as well as the difficulty sometimes encountered in predicting what these benefits will be prior to the staging of the event. An attempt is made to develop a typology of <b>major</b> <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> in terms of their potential to generate significant economic impact...|$|R

25|$|IBM has a {{valuable}} brand {{as a result}} of over 100 years of operations and marketing campaigns. Since 1996, IBM has been the exclusive technology partner for the Masters Tournament, one of the four major championships in professional golf, with IBM creating the first Masters.org (1996), the first course cam (1998), the first iPhone app with live streaming (2009), and first-ever live 4K Ultra High Definition feed in the United States for a <b>major</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>event</b> (2016). As a result, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty became the third female member of the Master's governing body, the Augusta National Golf Club. IBM is also a major sponsor in professional tennis, with engagements at the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, the Australian Open, and the French Open. The company also sponsored the Olympic Games from 1960-2000, and the National Football League from 2003-2012.|$|E

[...] She competed in the women's giant slalom on 18 February. In her first run, she finished in 69th place with a time of one minute and 35.27 seconds. Her second run and placement was improved; joint 61st place with a time of one minute and 34.52 seconds. This gave her the overall position of 62nd in a combined time of three minutes and 9.79 seconds, just ahead of Turkish skier Tuğba Daşdemir Kocaağa (three minutes and 9.8 seconds), but behind Triin Tobi from Estonia (three minutes and 9.17 seconds).

500|$|After a brief stint with {{a sports}} website, which Pollack once termed his “reverse MBA,” {{he was hired}} as the Managing Director of Broadcasting and New Media for NASCAR Digital Entertainment. NASCAR had {{recently}} consolidated its media rights and the brand reoriented the way it presented itself to consumer product and global media companies. Pollack helped develop NASCAR's television partnerships with Fox, FX, NBC and TNT and it was under his guidance that NASCAR grew into a <b>major</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>event.</b> At the time, it rose to the “second-most-watched sports franchise on cable TV, behind football." [...] Pollack also encouraged NASCAR to use advanced media and technologies. One of his central innovations was to create an immersive experience for viewers at home. He helped developed the cable TV program, NASCAR iN Car, which involved mounting cameras that could capture the race from inside the cars. Pollack won two Emmy Awards, as a result: the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Achievement in Interactive Television Programming and a Sports Emmy for Outstanding Innovative Technical Achievement. He {{was also the first}} to receive the Billboard Digital Entertainment Award for the best interactive television programming.|$|E
500|$|The game on May 1 in Philadelphia {{became a}} moment of peace in the rivalry during {{the top of the}} ninth inning. Mets' Daniel Murphy was batting as a pinch-hitter against Phillies' {{reliever}} Ryan Madson when the fans started chanting [...] "U-S-A!" [...] The Phillies didn't know the reason for the chants, but in the Mets' dugout, bench coach Ken Oberkfell told Manager Terry Collins that al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the September 11 attacks, had been killed by United States special operations forces in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Shane Victorino later told the Phillies the news. However, when asked how they learned about it during an on-air telephone call with Mike and Mike in the Morning on ESPN Radio the next day, he said that a trainer in the dugout broke the news. Ryan Howard called the news [...] "an uplifting moment," [...] while Victorino said it was [...] "a special moment...for families...who...lost their loved ones...(on) 9/11" [...] and [...] "a big day in American history." [...] On the Mets' side, David Wright called it [...] "just an incredible moment and...you kind of come together...for a common cause", while Collins said that the Mets 21, 14-inning win behind Ronny Paulino's game-winning RBI double in his Mets debut was [...] "a good win for us, and obviously a huge win for America tonight", but felt they [...] "could have finished the game two hours ago and celebrated a little bit of it." [...] Mike Lopresti of USA Today called the game between the rivals [...] "a perfect fit" [...] when the news broke, while Adam Rubin of ESPNNewYork.com called the peace in the rivalry [...] "fitting" [...] for a Mets fan, and said that it drew parallels to their 32 win over rival Atlanta Braves on September 21, 2001 in the first <b>major</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>event</b> in New York City since the attacks.|$|E
