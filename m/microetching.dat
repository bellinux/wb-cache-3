The relevance of this approach is studied in X-band by comparing numerically and experimentally the performance of a frequency-tunable coplanar waveguide stub resonator before and after KTN <b>microetching.</b> The experimental data demonstrate a large loss reduction (by a factor 3. 3), while keeping a high-frequency tunability (47 %) under a moderate biasing static electric field (80 kV/cm).

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this {{in-vitro}} study was to evaluate the effects of three different surface preparation methods on the shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets bonded to zirconia and determine the most appropriate method. Methods: 45 zirconia and 30 leucite-reinforced porcelain mandibular premolar crowns were divided into 5 groups and received the following surface preparations: 37 % phosphoric acid and non-hydrolyzed silane, 4 % hydrofluoric acid and hydrolyzed silane, <b>microetch</b> with 50 μ Al 2 O 3 particles. A universal adhesive primer containing MDP was applied and the brackets were bonded with a bis-GMA composite resin. Shear bond strength (SBS) at bond failure and ARI score were recorded. Results: There was {{a statistically significant difference}} among the studied groups for the SBS. The highest mean SBS (11. 03 MPA) was recorded for the zirconia/microetch group, and the lowest SBS (3. 49 MPa) for the zirconia/phosphoric acid group. The leucite-reinforced porcelain/ hydrofluoric acid group had significantly more fractures than any other debond pattern. The zirconia/hydrofluoric acid group was the only one with a SBS (8. 08 MPa) that fell within the recommended range of 6 - 8 MPa. This group also had a favorable debond pattern with most composite remaining on the bracket. Conclusions: Important consideration should be given to the surface preparation of porcelain and zirconia prior to bonding orthodontic attachments. Phosphoric acid etch is not an adequate surface preparation when bonding to zirconia. Hydrofluoric acid is not suitable when bonding to leucite-reinforced porcelain, as it is associated with a higher rate of surface fracture. <b>Microetch</b> with 50 μ Al 2 O 3 particles in combination with an MDP containing universal adhesive primer provided optimal mean shear bond strength, along with favorable debond patterns when bonding to zirconia. Hydrofluoric acid etch in combination with a silane and a universal primer containing MDP provided acceptable shear bond strength to zirconia. This protocol was not significantly different from zirconia prepared with <b>microetch</b> and either method can be successfully employed...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the mean {{retentive}} strength of <b>microetched</b> orthodontic bands cemented to extracted human third molars with a modified composite, a resin-modified glass ionomer cement, and a conventional glass ionomer cement. The mode of band failure and amount of cement remaining on the tooth at deband were also assessed. Finally, survival time of bands with each cement was assessed with simulated mechanical stress in a ball mill. Ninety banded specimens were used to assess retentive strength, and another 30 banded specimens were used to assess survival time. The mean retentive strength of the modified composite (0. 415 MPa) was significantly less than that of either the resin-modified (1. 715 MPa) or the conventional glass ionomer cement (1. 454 MPa; P . 05).

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study {{is made of}} the effects of dimple and finishing material of copper alloy lead frame on interface adhesion with epoxy molding compound. The surface plating materials studied include copper alloy, <b>microetched</b> copper, Ag, black oxide coating, Ni, Pd/Ni and Au/Ni plating. Special emphasis was placed on the effects of various stages in manufacturing processes, including post mold cure, thermal cycling, IR reflow and temperature and humidity storage, on the changes in interface adhesion. The interface bond strength was measured using the lead pull test. The lead frame surface was characterized using various techniques, such as;atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ellipsometry, Raman spectroscopy and contact angle measurements, to correlate the measured interface bond strength with the surface characteristics of various natures. It was confirmed that dimples etched on the lead frame surface offered several mechanical anchoring mechanisms and much improved interface bond with moulding compound. The interface bond strength and the number of dimples exhibited roughly a linear relationship. The black oxide and Pd coated surfaces were shown to provide the strongest interface adhesion, with the highest wettability amongst various surface finishes studied.

40|$|Diffractive optics {{fabrication}} {{is performed}} by two complementary processing methods {{that rely on}} the photoablation of materials by ultrashort UV laser pulses. The spatially selective ablation of materials permits the direct <b>microetching</b> of high-quality surface-relief patterns. In addition, the direct, spatially selective transfer of the ablated material onto planar and nonplanar receiving substrates provides a complementary microprinting operation. The radiation from the ultrashort pulsed excimer laser results in superior quality at relatively low-energy density levels, owing to the short absorption length and minimal thermal-diffusion effects. Computer-generated holographic structures are produced by both modes of operation.

Surprisingly with this laser, <b>microetching</b> can also be achieved on glass, despite the low absorption of this material at this wavelength.

An optimum laser fluence is found to be that which melts the sulphide particles without significant melting of the steel matrix or causing overlap of the characteristics halo formed by the out-flowing liquid from the sulphides. The geometric similarity of the sulphide inclusions is maintained and its spatial extent is amplified about 10 times. This brings sub-micron sulphide particles into optical resolution range.

40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} the shear bond strengths of buccal tubes {{and to determine}} the sites of failure. Method: Four orthodontic buccal tubes were selected: A, American Orthodontics; B, 3 M Unitek - small base; C, 3 M Unitek large base; D, Hangzhou Dentop. Twenty buccal tubes from each group were bonded to the buccal surfaces of lower right first molars with the some light-cured composite resin. The buccal tubes were debonded with a universal testing machine and the data analysed. The amount of adhesive remaining on the teeth after debonding was classified with the modified adhesive remnant index (ARI). Results: The groups ranked from the highest to lowest bond strength (MPa) were: B, A, D and C. The bond strengths of the buccal tubes, except Groups A and B, were significantly different (p < 0. 05). The majority of the buccal tubes 163 per cent) had modified ARI scores of 1 and 2 and 25 per cent of the tubes had scores of 4 and 5. After debonding, no adhesive remained on 40 per cent of the teeth in Groups B and D. Conclusions: The shear bond strengths of the buccal tubes fell below the value considered to be clinically acceptable. There were no differences between the shear bond strengths of the buccal tubes with photoetched and <b>microetched</b> bases. The buccal tubes with the largest base failed prematurely, possibly because the unsupported bonding pad flexed during debonding. (Aust Orthod J 2010; 26 : 184 - 188...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{process for}} the fabrication of random arrays of silicon nanotips has been demonstrated to be feasible. Relative to other such processes, this process offers advantages of low cost and simplicity. Moreover, this process can readily be combined with other processes used to fabricate integrated circuits and other monolithic silicon structures. Arrays of silicon nanotips are subjects {{of research and development}} efforts directed toward utilizing them as field emitters in flat-panel displays, vacuum microelectronics, and microwave devices. Other silicon-nanotip-fabrication processes developed thus far predominantly include lithography, etching, and/or elaborate deposition steps followed by oxide sharpening steps and are both process intensive as well as expensive. In addition to being cheaper and simpler, the present process can efficiently produce silicon nanotips that range in height from a few microns to several tens of microns and are distributed over large areas. The process mentioned here can be summarized as consisting of (1) the growth of micro-etch masks on a silicon substrate, followed by (2) etching away of the masks, along with some of the substrate, to make an array of sharp tips. In the first step of the process, a cleaned silicon substrate is subjected to reactive ion etching (RIE) in a certain mixture of oxygen and carbon tetrafluoride under radio-frequency excitation. This process step results in the growth of fluorine based compounds in the form of stumps randomly distributed on the substrate. These stumps are known in the art as polymer RIE grass. The dimensions of these stumps are of the order of hundreds of nanometers, the exact values depending on process time and gas composition. The areal density of the stumps decreases with increasing process time as they grow and merge with neighboring stumps. These stumps constitute the micro-etch masks for the next step of the process. In the second step of the process, the substrate covered with the <b>microetch</b> masks is subjected to deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) process, which consists of cycles of reactive ion etching alternating with passivation (the Bosch process). The gas used in the etching substeps is sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6); the gas used in the passivation substeps is octafluorocyclobutane (C 4 F 8). The portions of the substrate directly under the RIE grass stubs are etched more slowly than are the portions between the stubs. Hence, what remains {{at the end of the}} process, after the stubs and parts of the substrate have been etched away, are silicon spikes where the stubs were (see figure). In a variation of the process, one starts with a silicon or silicon-on-insulator substrate with the intent to etch through the full thickness of the substrate. That is to say, one chooses the thickness so that the DRIE step releases individual nanotips. Such individual silicon nanotips may have utility as microscopic probes in biomedical applications...|$|R

30|$|CSBS {{provides}} more realistic and valuable information (compared to SSBS) about the material’s long-term {{performance in the}} clinical situation. In other words, CSBS {{could be used as}} a more reliable predictive indicator of bond strength in the oral environment [20 – 23]. In the present study, the staircase method was used to determine CSBS. In this method, the data are concentrated around the mean stress; hence, the number of specimens is smaller than that required with other techniques. Subsequently, this method is less time consuming [31]. In spite of the relatively low magnitude of the cyclic loads, this method could lead to microcracks and structural failure, a phenomena commonly known as fatigue [23, 31]. Several factors could affect fatigue, such as stress concentration, corrosion, temperature, overload, microstructure, and residual stresses [19]. In the current study, the utilization of either surface bur treatment or <b>microetching</b> provided comparable CSBS values. Accordingly, the bonded brackets could withstand the stresses of mastication and orthodontic appliances (fatigue resistance) at the same level.|$|E

Better {{methods are}} needed to evaluate the microstructural evolution of the weld. However, conventional Al reagents (e. g., Keller’s and Kroll’s) do not elucidate the microstructure satisfactorily, specifically regarding grain size and morphology within the weld region. APPROACH—We developed innovative etchants for metallographic observations for optical microscopy. RESULTS—The macrostructure and microstructure of A 6082 -T 6 BFSW welds were clearly demonstrated by optical microscopy analysis. The <b>microetching</b> results demonstrated different microstructures of the Stir Zone (S. Z) distinct from the Base Metal (B.

Furthermore, thermomechanical recrystallization was observed by the morphological flow of the grain distortion in HAZ and TMAZ. The etchants also clearly show the polycrystalline structure, microflow patterns, and the incoherent interface around inclusion defects.

Two potential-sweep ranges,- 0. 4 to 0. 9 (I) and 0 to 0. 9 (II) V versus SCE, and four solutions, acidic (A, 0. 20 mol/L H 2 SO 4 + 0. 10 mol/L Na 2 -SO 4; B, 0. 10 mol/L H 2 SO 4 + 0. 20 mol/L Na 2 SO 4), neutral (C, 0. 10 mol/L PBS + 0. 20 mol/L Na 2 SO 4, pH 7. 2), and alkaline (D, 0. 20 mol/L NaOH + 0. 20 mol/L Na 2 SO 4) aqueous solutions, were selected for PoPD growth. The pH increase for the polymerization solution increased the molar percentage of polyaniline-like chains in PoPD, as quantified from the current peaks at 0. 6 V versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) for the oxidation of-NH 2 groups in as-prepared PoPD (grown from solutions C and D) during their redox switching in 0. 10 mol/L aqueous H 2 SO 4 for the first time. The unusual PQCI responses observed at negative potentials (potential range I) in the first several potential cycles during the cyclic voltammetric growth of PoPD in acidic and neutral solutions have been reasonably explained as being due to the precipitation/dissolution of the poorly soluble phenazinehydrine charge-transfer complexes developed during redox switching o...|$|E
