50|$|Weeks later, Dusty {{found two}} guys in Metro attacking Lucy Montgomery. He saved her life, but Lucy's father Craig wasn't so {{grateful}} after <b>Molly</b> <b>said</b> those guys were probably {{the same ones}} who wanted the money from Dusty. When Dusty found out Lucy was leaving town, he went to her to ask if she could remember anything about those guys, but Lucy denied, saying she had no clear memory. Dusty let her go, but then he {{caught a glimpse of}} her limo driver and realized it was the same guy who attacked her. He chased the limo and pulled Lucy out of the car. They hid in a wooden cabin until the attackers found them again. They managed to escape and this time, they found an abandoned place where they hid out for weeks. Although they were first antagonistic towards each other, as Lucy was a spoiled 18-year-old, and Dusty a criminal 30 something, they grew closer, as both saved each other's lives several times. After Lucy could go back to Oakdale safely, they started a relationship, against wishes from Lucy's family. A few months later, Dusty was approached by an old friend, Dominic Ramsey, who planned to set up a boxing match in Oakdale's Gym. Dusty found the perfect candidate in Aaron Snyder, but what Dusty, Lucy and Aaron didn't know was Dom's boxer, Rafael, was ordered to fight with loaded gloves. When Rafi gave Aaron the final punch, Aaron slipped into a coma and was paralyzed. After finding out the secret, Dusty went after Dom, who said to leave him alone or he would come after Lucy. Then, Lucy and Rafael were taken by Dominic and they disappeared {{from the face of the}} earth. After weeks, Dusty finally found out where they were: an abandoned mineshaft in the mountains. Dusty found them and brought them home safely. Lucy was unsure what to do with her future next, after she slept with Rafael in the mine. Dusty, in the meantime, realized he wanted to be with Lucy no matter what and bought an engagement ring. When he was about to propose, Lucy told him she was going back to Montega, and going to college. Though it broke Dusty's heart, he understood and he let her leave Oakdale.|$|E
