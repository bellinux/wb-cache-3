In 1987, Shiller, Nancy Kaszak, and Gerald Pechenuk challenged Orbach. Kaszak was a lawyer, a former {{vice president of the}} , a Mayor Harold Washington appointee to the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, a leader of the Lakeview Citizens' Council, and president of Citizens United for Baseball in Sunshine (CUBS), which opposed night baseball at Wrigley Field. Newfeld co-chaired Kaszak's campaign. Pechenuk was a consultant for Lyndon LaRouche Jr. for 12 years, and was treasurer of LaRouche-supported Sheila Jones's mayoral campaign. Shiller challenged Pechenuk's nominating petitions.|$|E
500|$|Finally, on May 19, Giuliani held what The New York Times again {{described}} as [...] "an emotional, riveting news conference" [...] that [...] "reached {{a new level}} of introspection" [...] to announce that he was dropping out of the senate race: [...] "This is not the right time for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for office. If it were six months ago or it were a year from now or the timing were a little different, maybe it would be different. But it isn't different and that's the way life is." [...] He added that, [...] "I used to think the core of me was in politics, probably. It isn't. When you feel your mortality and your humanity you realize that, that the core of you is first of all being {{able to take care of}} your health." [...] He said that he would instead devote the remainder of his mayoralty trying to overcome the hostile relations he had with many of the city's minority groups.|$|E
2500|$|... "During a White House dinner," [...] Welles {{recalled}} in a 1983 conversation {{with his friend}} Roger Hill, [...] "when I was campaigning for Roosevelt, in a toast, with considerable tongue in cheek, he said, 'Orson, you and I are the two greatest actors alive today.' In private that evening, and on several other occasions, he urged <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for a Senate seat either in California or Wisconsin. He wasn't alone." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{might as}} well have {{struggled}} with a bear, or reasoned with a lunatic. The only resource left <b>me</b> was <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>to</b> a lattice and warn his intended victim of the fate which awaited him.|$|R
2500|$|The {{restrictions}} {{contained in}} contracts and regulations considerably cramped the entrepreneurial style of Zong, who complained of limits the control structure placed on him. [...] "Most {{of the decisions}} had {{to be approved by}} Danone board members at board meetings once every quarter. How you want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the business under such conditions?" [...] The greater maturity in the company has made Zong feel he needs his foreign partner less.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding Oliveri's backing vocal contributions, Homme noted: [...] "Nick and I {{have been}} friends since a couple weeks after {{everything}} went down in 2004. People don't know that, {{and it would be}} awkward for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> around making sure everyone knew it. Nick recorded his new record at my studio, and then he was going to drop off some records and he said, 'Hey, need anyone to sing backup?' And I was like, 'Actually, yeah, come on in.' That's a nice thing. It was easy. It's nice to know someone since you were a little kid, and still know them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the week}} prior to announcing his candidacy, Colbert {{appeared}} {{on a number of}} talk shows to promote his book I Am America (And So Can You). [...] During these interviews, he parodied potential candidates' standard approach to a White House run, giving broad and generally unprompted hints towards a campaign on shows like Larry King Live. [...] "A lot of people see this book as testing the waters for a run for political office," [...] he told King in an October 14, 2007 interview. On the same day, Colbert took over The New York Times opinion columnist Maureen Dowd's column, which he used to engage in similar speculation: [...] "I know why you want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>run,</b> and I hear your clamor...Nevertheless, I am not ready to announce yet – even though it's clear that the voters are desperate for a white, male, middle-aged, Jesus-trumpeting alternative." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Showed me an order, {{signed by}} a person I won't name," [...] the captain went on, {{lowering}} his voice, [...] "requesting <b>me</b> <b>to</b> practically <b>run</b> the ship according to his directions--making him a kind of Almighty boss." ...|$|R

6000|$|Ida was magnificent; Ida {{kissed her}} on the forehead. [...] "That's just what I thought likely; it made <b>me</b> decide <b>to</b> <b>run</b> down. I fancied that in spite of your {{scramble}} you'd wait to cross, and it added to the reason I have for seeing you." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2011 and 2012, Plunkett {{struggled}} with form and played just three Championship matches for Durham. In October 2012, Plunkett signed {{to play for}} Yorkshire. He stated, [...] "At this stage of my career, I believe that a fresh challenge would benefit me and I feel this is required to help me reach my goal of representing my country again". In his first season at Yorkshire, Plunkett played in 12 of the club's 16 matches in the County Championship, managing to take 36 wickets. He credits Jason Gillespie, Yorkshire's coach and former Australia international fast bowler, with helping him regain his confidence and felt that his problems had been exacerbated by over-coaching. In an interview in June 2014 Plunkett explained [...] "Different coaches told me different things and when you're a youngster you're like a sponge and {{take a lot of}} things in.... When I came to Yorkshire, Jason Gillespie just told <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> it and bowl quick. And when I did that I backed myself, bowled in my good areas and started picking up wickets." [...] Under the tutelage of Yorkshire coach and former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie, Plunkett's fortunes improved and he was awarded his county cap in 2013. The following year, Plunkett was recalled to the England Test team.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first few}} seconds {{are the most}} crucial and {{controversial}} of the disaster. Survivors insist that a female official immediately stood up and shouted: [...] "Students sit down; don’t move. Let the leaders walk out first (...) [...] " [...] (Note: In Chinese, the order: 让领导先走 has since became a popular internet catch phrase, meaning the government officials have priority over ordinary folks in times of emergency). She has since been identified in online articles as Kuang Li (况丽), who was vice-director of the state petroleum company’s local education centre, though {{there has been no}} official confirmation of this. [...] The teachers obeyed, and the children remain seated. [...] By the time the about 20 Communist Party officials had filed out through the only opened emergency exit, when all the other exits remained locked, it was too late. Teachers hurried the pupils out of their seats to other exits, only to find that the emergency exit doors were locked, and no one seem to care enough to get them opened. [...] Parents and survivors alleged that Kuang took refuge in a ladies’ cloakroom that could have sheltered 30 people and barred the doors behind her. [...] A 10-year-old boy said [...] "My teacher asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> out of the theatre, but when I stood up the hall was smothered in smoke and fire. The power then cut out. People could see nothing. The place was full of crying and shouting." ...|$|E

5000|$|Vacationing in Mexico, Massino {{immediately}} {{met with}} each of the Bonanno capos to tell them {{he did not know what}} happened to Sciascia and theorized it was a bad drug deal. However, in private, Massino reportedly remarked [...] "It served him right for telling <b>me</b> how <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the family." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Get {{men that}} are honest," [...] Billy said. [...] "That's the whole trouble. Not that I stand for socialism. I don't.

6000|$|... "No, no," [...] she {{answered}} laughingly, [...] "I care not for sleep. What is sleep? it {{is a little}} death--voilà tout. But for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> walk, <b>to</b> <b>run,</b> <b>to</b> breathe the air--that is to live. I was not tired, and so all night I have explored these fells of Yorkshire." ...|$|R

5000|$|Asked in 2010 about a {{possible}} conflict of interest, Sidney Harman said: [...] "We’ve been married for over 30 years.

60|$|Lau. Indeed, papa, now I'll {{tell you}} how it was. I was {{sometime}} taken with a sudden giddiness, and Humphrey seeing <b>me</b> beginning <b>to</b> totter, <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> my assistance, quite frightened, poor fellow, and took me in his arms.|$|R
60|$|I replied it {{certainly}} could not. The subject did not admit of a doubt. He thanked <b>me</b> and <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> his mother's again--and back again.|$|R
