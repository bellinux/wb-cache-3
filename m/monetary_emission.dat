40|$|The {{article is}} aimed at {{studying}} the preconditions for introduction, the main problems and prospects for implementation of the inflation targeting regime in Ukraine. In 2014, the country got into a crisis that affected at once the currency market, the banking system and the real sector, resulting in devaluations, bank failures, decreasing GDP, growing prices. One of {{the responses to the}} financial challenges was the transition to inflationary targeting, which led to a slowdown in inflation in 2016 - 2017. Goals of an inflation targeting are both price growth and international reserves. Achieving these goals implies a policy of «expensive money», exclusive smoothing by interventions of excessive fluctuations, lack of fiscal dominance, prudent fiscal policies, and elimination of quasi-fiscal imbalances. The risks of current monetary policy are the slow implementation of reforms, which can stop external lending, «pre-election» increases in social spending, debt burden growth, and the escalation of hostilities in the east of the country. Further actions by the State should include: minimization of <b>monetary</b> <b>emissions,</b> further reduction of the interest rate, providing the positive level of rates by the National Bank of Ukraine in terms of inflation, increased use of compulsory reservation of the funds involved, restriction of sales of domestic bonds and the NBU certificates to banks...|$|R

We show that the level of equilibrium depends on the rate of discount. We give conditions to guarantee uniqueness of the equilibrium. We demonstrate that the unique equilibrium is either a classical « saddle point » or a « source point »; that the introduction of money in the utility and production function is sufficient to produce multiple stationary equilibria; and that the initial stock of money appears as an important economic control variable. Therefore, the initial amount of the <b>monetary</b> <b>emission</b> issued by the central bank becomes essential for the long run economic equilibrium properties. economic growth, money, multiple equilibria. ...|$|E

40|$|Fiscal Framework for Economic Stability”. (Friedman 1948) In that piece, he {{put forward}} {{what he thought}} was a new {{proposal}} according to which the government would run a balanced budget only at full employment, with deficits in recession and surpluses in economic booms. There was nothing too controversial about that—indeed, this view of the proper fiscal stance was incorporated into just about all post-war orthodox thought. In recent years, however, at least some economists have been supporting persistent budget surpluses. Indeed, in America over the past decade, the Democrats (led by President Clinton) decided to become fiscally responsible and have advocated permanent budget surpluses come what may. But what was unusual was Friedman’s “proposal ” to finance budget deficits through money creation. Surpluses would destroy money. He thus proposed to combine monetary policy and fiscal policy, using the budget to control <b>monetary</b> <b>emission</b> in a countercyclical manner.

It is demonstrated that, if adequate measures are not taken, one may expect a surge of inflation around {{the end of this year}} that may also mark the start of stagflation as there are no sufficient grounds to expect the re-start of the dynamic growth of the world economy by that time. On the other hand, as the experience of the 1970 s and the 1980 s indicates, the stagflation consequences can only be eliminated with great difficulties and at a rather high cost, because the combination of low levels of economic growth and employment with high inflation leads to a sharp decline in consumption, aggravating the economic depression. In order to mitigate the inflationary consequences of the explosive growth of money (and, first of all, US dollar) supply it is necessary to take urgently the world <b>monetary</b> <b>emission</b> under control.

It considers both the different methods of managing credit and investments, and the transformation of the banking sector which emerged in the aftermath of unification of Italy and the transfer of the capital to Florence. Marco Cini uses as a case study the Banca Nazionale Toscana, established shortly after unification (1857). He examines, on the one hand, the relationships with the important Tuscan landowners and the Florentine financial system, which came to be associated with forms of speculation, especially in the construction field, when the capital was moved to Florence. On the other hand, he explores the theme of <b>monetary</b> <b>emission</b> and relationships with the issuing banks and the new state power. Simone Fagioli examines the activities of two private banks, Banco Fenzi and Banco Schmitz & Turri, using previously unpublished archive material.

40|$|The {{price of}} {{emission}} permits is deemed {{too low to}} mitigate climate change. In three studies, policy approaches to pricing carbon in a market setting are examined. First, the emission permit market is analyzed comparatively to how the ethanol mandate impacted prices in the corn market. This leads {{to the realization that}} the marketization of carbon is more like a currency than a physical commodity. The next study examines emission permits as a <b>monetary</b> policy tool. <b>Emissions</b> correlate GDP output, thus central banks can use emission permits as forward guidance, as a means to optimize the price for climate change mitigation, and as an alternative to interest rates. Opinions of thought leaders are used to question the acceptability of emission permits as a monetary policy tool. The final study is an ethical analysis using deontology, utilitarianism and virtue ethics within a pragmatic philosophical context, analyzing carbon as a monetary policy tool. In order for carbon as a monetary policy tool to be considered ethically acceptable, it must satisfy the temporal, spatial and institutional dilemmas of climate change articulated in Stephen Gardiner’s Perfect Moral Storm. Under this ethical standard, it is found that using carbon as a monetary policy tool can help address these concerns, but not solve them alone.

40|$|The {{emission}} of pollutants from energy use has effects on both local air quality and the global climate, but the price of energy does not reflect these externalities. This study aims to analyze the effect that internalizing these externalities {{in the cost of}} energy would have on the US energy system, emissions, and human health. In this study, we model different policy scenarios in which fees are added to emissions related to generation and use of energy. The fees are based on values of damages estimated in the literature and are applied to upstream and combustion emissions related to electricity generation, industrial energy use, transportation energy use, residential energy use, and commercial energy use. The energy sources and emissions are modeled through 2055 in five-year time steps. The emissions in 2045 are incorporated into a continental-scale atmospheric chemistry and transport model, CMAQ, to determine the change in air quality due to different emissions reduction scenarios. A benefit analysis tool, BenMAP, is used with the air quality results to determine the <b>monetary</b> benefit of <b>emissions</b> reductions related to the improved air quality. We apply fees to emissions associated with health impacts, climate change, and a combination of both. We find that the fees we consider lead to reductions in targeted emissions as well as co-reducing non-targeted emissions. For fees on the electric sector alone, health impacting pollutant (HIP) emissions reductions are achieved mainly through control devices while Greenhouse Gas (GHG) fees are addressed through changes in generation technologies. When sector specific fees are added, reductions come mainly from the industrial and electricity generation sectors, and are achieved through a mix of energy efficiency, increased use of renewables, and control devices. Air quality is improved in almost all areas of the country with fees, including when only GHG fees are applied. Air quality tends to improve more in regions with larger emissions reductions, especially for PM 2. 5...|$|R
40|$|Lately, in {{political}} and economic circles, a fierce debate {{on the need for}} additional <b>monetary</b> <b>emission</b> in Russia. The debate continues to this day. A number of economists and entrepreneurs are convinced of the need for cash injection into our economy to stimulate economic growth. They claim that lack of money hinders economic growth, because the lack of financial resources is hampering investment. At the same time criticized the Central Bank for a set them high key interest rate today at 10 %, which hampers not only investment in the real sector of the economy, but the current actual production. After all, profitability in most sectors of the real economy below 10 %. Other economists, including the Government of the Russian Federation and the Central Bank of the country, hold the opposite point of view.

40|$|URL] EMU or the {{question}} of central banks' independence raise questions centered on the privilege of minting money. In this perspective, it seems important to study Neochartalism, {{in so far as}} it extends the analysis initiated by Knapp, and investigates specifically the links between money and the State. This text is a critical analysis, based on both historical and theoretical arguments. Neochartalism first assumes that there is a link between fiscal policy and the collective acceptability of money. However, as argued by Aglietta and Orlean, focusing exclusively on the power of the State to impose taxes does not seems sufficient to appraise all of this phenomenon's characteristics. When Neochartalists focus on the way money is integrated into the economy, they again establish a link between fiscal policy and <b>monetary</b> <b>emission.</b> Nevertheless, the analysis of our modern systems of payments shows {{that it is difficult to}} consider that the State can initiate the process of money creation. Within our current banking and monetary economies, money seems to be created by the banks rather than by the State. La dollarisation de certaines économies, la création de l'euro ou la question de l'indépendance des banques centrales soulèvent des interrogations centrées sur le privilège de « battre monnaie ». A cet égard, la thèse néo-chartaliste, qui développe l'analyse initiée par Knapp, mérite une attention toute particulière, puisqu'elle aborde spécifiquement les liens entre monnaie et État. Nous en proposons dans ce texte une lecture critique, basée sur des éléments historiques et théoriques. L'approche néo-chartaliste suppose tout d'abord un lien entre fiscalité et acceptabilité collective de la monnaie. Or, en s'appuyant notamment sur les travaux d'Aglietta et Orléan, il apparaît que le seul recours à l'État n'est pas suffisant pour appréhender dans toute sa complexité ce problème. Lorsqu'ils s'intéressent aux phénomènes d'intégration de la monnaie dans l'économie, les néo-chartalistes établissent de nouveau un lien entre fiscalité et émission monétaire. Toutefois, l'analyse du système des paiements actuel montre qu'il est délicat de conférer à l'État un rôle moteur en matière de création monétaire. Au sein de nos économies monétaires et bancaires, la monnaie semble ainsi bien plus une créature des banques que de l'État...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuing}} {{growth of}} freight transportation has placed significant stress on U. S. and European transportation networks. The dominance of trucking {{as the main}} mode of domestic general cargo transportation has caused environmental and societal problems, such as traffic congestion, air pollution, highway accidents, noise, and increased energy consumption. Using inland and coastal waterways, short sea shipping (SSS) can alleviate these problems. SSS can provide efficient door-to-door transportation {{as part of an}} intermodal system, where ships perform the long-haul and trucks the short haul cargo collection and distribution. This dissertation examines the economic feasibility of SSS. The environmental and societal advantages of SSS over competing modes are translated into lower external costs. External costs or externalities are the hidden costs not reflected in transportation prices. This non-inclusion is considered a market failure by economists. Estimating their monetary value is a challenging task. There is an inherent subjectivity, imprecision, and vagueness in current external cost valuation methods. This dissertation addresses this vagueness and imprecision of externalities using fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic treats subjectivity with mathematical rigor. Several factors that determine the impact level of transportation externalities are modeled as fuzzy input variables. The outputs are the damage costs of major air pollutants and the external costs of traffic congestion. A fuzzy inference system can provide site-specific monetary estimation for these externalities under defined conditions, instead of average values. The results show that SSS has great potential for further improving its environmental performance by lowering ship emissions at ports, where most of its external costs occur, by implementing procedures, such as “cold ironing. ” The dissertation assesses the feasibility and competitiveness of SSS, in comparison to the all-truck mode, in two realistic cases of prospective short sea operations along the U. S. East Coast. SSS is highly competitive, due to its significant energy efficiencies. Furthermore, its environmental performance, in terms of <b>monetary</b> impact of <b>emissions</b> is superior, due to location. Combining the internal costs with the external cost estimates, the two case studies demonstrate the fair pricing principle in freight transportation, where prices are based on the full social cost of a transportation mode...|$|R
40|$|Regulating carbon {{markets in}} order to fight the {{effects of climate change}} has in recent years become an {{integral}} part of many economies around the world. Ensuring that policymakers implement market-based climate change legislation according to international best practice is an essential part to guarantee that a carbon market system operates smoothly within a country’s economy. There are many opportunities that exist in South Africa towards developing a lucrative carbon market; however, the information to implement such a system is hard to come by and complex to analyse. This dissertation will aim to shed some light on this relatively new field of the law as it will provide an overview of international best practice within the carbon market sphere. Furthermore, this dissertation will examine the legal nature of a carbon credit; analyse international instruments regulating carbon markets and discuss existing South African policies and legislation related to climate change and carbon markets. This will lead to the ultimate objective of this dissertation: to propose a possible framework for the regulation of a South African carbon market based upon international best practice. This dissertation revealed the imperative need for South African policymakers to implement legislation to conform to international best practice within carbon markets. In this regard the dissertation also revealed that the infrastructure to regulate such a market already exists within South Africa. Only subtle changes to these infrastructure systems will be required in order for to accommodate a functioning carbon market. The study revealed that the only way to convince entities around the world to emit fewer emissions and to contribute towards the fight against climate change is to attach a <b>monetary</b> value to <b>emissions.</b> Associating a price to carbon is the only way to sanction entities that produce emissions and compensate entities that mitigate emissions. A carbon tax coupled with a carbon offset mechanism, as opposed to a emissions trading scheme, would be the best option with regards to establishing a South African carbon policy. This will ensure a fair playing field, as carbon tax liable entities would be held responsible to pay the same fixed price per ton of carbon that they emit. Coupling the carbon tax with a carbon offset mechanism, trading with carbon credits, will incentivise companies to invest in “greener” technologies and to emit fewer emissions. This dissertation revealed that international best practice in the carbon market sphere, still poses significant difficulties such as price volatility associated with carbon credits; validation and verification inconsistencies within the different carbon standards; and supply and demand fluctuations. These difficulties where highlighted in this dissertation and solutions relating to these difficulties were discussed. The time has come for South Africa to enter the carbon market sphere, whether it be through the introduction of a carbon tax or otherwise. This dissertation illustrates that the infrastructure and stakeholders associated to a South African carbon market needs to be developed. If, when and how the government will actually implement such a carbon market system, remains a question to be answered...|$|R
