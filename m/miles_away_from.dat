5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1918 the cathedral {{was in danger of}} an attack by the Turks. Prior to the May 1918 Battle of Sardarabad, which took place just <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the cathedral, the {{civilian}} and military leadership of Armenia suggested Catholicos Gevorg (George) V to leave for Byurakan for security purposes, but he refused. The Armenian forces eventually repelled the Turkish offensive and set the foundation of the First Republic of Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{locations}} either were real, or were filmed {{with the use}} of stand-ins. The gate for the Area 51 set was filmed at a fence on the San Bernardino county line, one hundred and twenty <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Los Angeles. The restaurant that the characters visit, the Little A'Le'Inn, is an actual cafe off Highway 375 in Rachel, Nevada. The inside, however, was an elaborate set, as the original is much too small.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Georgetown's Floyd and North Carolina's Worthy also drew some {{attention from the}} media.

Worthy commented that his family lives around two to three <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Floyd's. It was noted that the two would likely not interact much while playing as they did not play the same position.|$|E

According to the 2000 Census 53,840 people or 27% of the population identified themselves Armenian in Glendale. Glendale also home to the highest percentage of people born in Armenia. Other than Glendale and Los Angeles proper, significant Armenian populations reside in Burbank (8,312), Pasadena (4,400), Montebello (2,736), Altadena (2,134), La Crescenta-Montrose (1,382). The Armenian Genocide Martyrs Monument, the oldest and largest Armenian Genocide memorial in the US, is located in Montebello.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad and the Muslims {{buried the}} {{dead on the}} battlefield, {{returning}} home that evening. The Meccans retired for the evening {{at a place called}} Hamra al-Asad, a few <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Medina. The next morning, Muhammad sent out a small force to harass the Meccan army on their way home. According to Watt, this was because Muhammad realized that a show of force was required to speed the Meccans away from Medinan territory. The Meccans, not wanting to be perceived as being chased away, remained nearby for a few days before leaving.|$|E

The lodge was first made nationally famous later that year when actress Clara Bow cancelled checks owed to the casino worth $13,000; she claimed that she had believed that the chips she was using while playing blackjack were worth 50 cents when they were actually valued at $100.|$|E
5|$|The Crosby Garrett Helmet is {{a copper}} alloy Roman cavalry helmet {{dating from the}} late 2nd or early 3rd century AD. It was found by an unnamed metal detectorist near Crosby Garrett in Cumbria, England, in May 2010. Later {{investigations}} found that a Romano-British farming settlement had occupied {{the site where the}} helmet was discovered, which was located a few <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> a Roman road and a Roman army fort. It is possible that the owner of the helmet was a local inhabitant who had served with the Roman cavalry.|$|E
5|$|The {{airfield}} is very {{isolated in}} northwest Utah, {{sitting in the}} middle of a vast wasteland <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> any major population center. It is probably for this reason, and the dry hot climate, that much of the airfield remains today. Still-extant facilities include the vast runway system, numerous ramps, taxiways, dispersal pads, and most of the original hangars (including the Enola Gay B-29 hangar). Most of the hospital complex and many barracks remain, as does a chow hall, chapel, swimming pool and many other World War II-era buildings.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{the injury}} was still {{believed}} to be minor and Cloutier volunteered to continue playing in lieu of backup Mathieu Garon also being sidelined with a broken finger. When {{the pain in his}} hip quickly got worse, Cloutier appealed to team management. He saw a specialist who diagnosed him with a torn hip labrum and told him the injury could put his career in jeopardy. He was subsequently flown to Colorado for surgery on January 12, 2007. Cloutier remained in Colorado for ongoing treatment and was lodged by the organization in a motel 31 <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the clinic. The Kings' original insistence that he play and his subsequent lodging proved to be a contentious issue for Cloutier.|$|E
5|$|On June 22, showers {{increased}} {{associated with}} a tropical wave several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> land. Three days later, deep convection became more concentrated, and the system became a tropical depression. It intensified into Tropical Storm Carlos as banding features increased and the outflow became better defined. As it moved west, convection diminished as Carlos moved into cooler water. Shortly thereafter, increased wind shear took its toll on Carlos as the low-level center became exposed from the deep convection. Carlos weakened into a depression early on June 27, and dissipated June 28. However, a swirl of clouds remained {{for a couple of}} days. Except for Socorro Island, which the system passed close to, Carlos never threatened land. No indications of casualties or damage were reported.|$|E

Elinor stays at her side until she recovers, and the sisters return home. Colonel Brandon and Marianne begin spending time together, as Marianne has a new appreciation for him. She admits to Elinor that even if Willoughby had chosen her, she was no longer convinced that love would have been enough to make him happy.|$|E

5|$|Other {{aspects of}} the excise law also caused concern. The law {{required}} all stills to be registered, and those cited for failure to pay the tax had to appear in distant Federal, rather than local courts. The only Federal courthouse was in Philadelphia, some 300 <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the small frontier settlement of Pittsburgh. From the beginning, the Federal government had little success in collecting the whiskey tax along the frontier. Many small western distillers simply refused to pay the tax. Federal revenue officers and local residents who assisted them bore {{the brunt of the}} protester's ire. Tax rebels harassed several whiskey tax collectors and threatened or beat those who offered them office space or housing. As a result, many western counties never had a resident Federal tax official.|$|E
5|$|The assault at Zeebrugge a few <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Ostend {{was more}} {{successful}} and the blocking {{of the major}} channel did cause some consternation amongst the German forces in Bruges. The larger raiders could no longer leave the port, but smaller ships, including most submarines, were still able to traverse via Ostend. In addition, within hours a narrow channel had also been carved through Zeebrugge too, although British intelligence did not realise this for several weeks. The defeat at Ostend did not entirely dampen the exuberant British media and public reaction to Zeebrugge, but in the Admiralty {{and particularly in the}} Allied Naval and Marine Forces the failure to completely neutralise Bruges rankled.|$|E
5|$|The script {{demanded a}} dry location: an {{agricultural}} village {{where it had}} not rained in several years. To depict the 1890s era, the crew also required a village which lacked electricity, communication and automobiles. Kutch faced the same problems {{at that time and}} hence the village of Kunariya, located a few <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Bhuj, was chosen. During the filming of Lagaan, it did not rain at all in the region. However, a week after the shoot finished, it rained heavily bringing relief to Bhuj, which had a lean monsoon the previous year. The typical old Kutch hamlet was built by the local people four months before the arrival of the crew. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake devastated this region and displaced many locals. The crew, including the English, contributed to their cause by donating , with further contributions during the year.|$|E
