40|$|Many {{countries}} adopted specific {{tax laws}} {{with regard to}} the inheritance of family businesses. Tax exemptions result from the belief that the burden of the inheritance tax might force family-owned companies to shut down the business. This is especially presumed when a company is facing <b>a</b> sudden death <b>of</b> its ceo.

In this paper we test how fragile Flemish family businesses are at the <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>forced</b> transfer <b>of</b> the family firm, using survey data and accounting records for 273 family-owned companies. The ability to pay inheritance taxes is proxied by the liquid assets and the available and tax-free reserves.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of biomechanical loading in the musculoskeletal {{system of the}} pregnant women is particularly interesting since {{they are subject to}} morphological, physiological and hormonal changes, which may lead to adaptations in gait. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the effect of the increased mass in the trunk associated to pregnancy on the lower limb and pelvis, during walking, on temporal-distance parameters, joint range <b>of</b> motion and <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> by comparing <b>a</b> pregnant women group to a non-pregnant group, and to this group while carrying a 5 kg additional load located in the abdomen and breasts during walking, to understand which gait adaptations may be more related with the increased trunk mass, or if may be more associated with other factors such as the girth of the thigh. The subjects performed a previous 12 min training adaption to the added load. To calculate ankle, knee and hip joint angles and <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> <b>a</b> three-dimensional biomechanical model was developed. The inverse dynamics method was used to estimate net joint <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> force. The increased mass of the anterior trunk associated with second trimester of pregnancy may influence some gait variables such as the left step time, left and right stance times, double limb support time, maximum hip extension, maximum pelvic right obliquity, pelvic obliquity range of motion, maximum transversal left rotation and peak hip flexion <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> force. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Background. Conservative {{treatment}} for osteoarthritis often involves educating {{the patient in}} methods of decreasing the load transmitted through the diseased joint. The use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cane is one such method and the correct placement of the cane with respect to an abnormal knee joint is crucial. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare effects on knee <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> force of contralateral versus ipsilateral cane usage in female subjects with osteoarthritic knees. Methods. <b>A</b> convenience sample <b>of</b> 14 subjects volunteered for this study. Subjects walked over force platforms while ground reaction force and three-dimensional kinematic data were captured using a Vicon 370 System. The subjects were tested walking: (a) unaided, (b) with ipsilateral cane, and (c) with contralateral cane. Inverse dynamics were employed to calculate temporal-spatial, kinematic and kinetic variables. Dependent variables included hip and knee frontal plane and sagittal plane <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> force, walking speed, cadence and stride length. Repeated measures ANOVA assessed differences among walking conditions. Findings. Subjects walked significantly faster in the unaided gait condition owing to a higher cadence. Ipsilateral cane use resulted in significantly larger hip (versus contralateral P = 0. 018; versus unaided P = 0. 036) and knee (versus contralateral P = 0. 043; versus unaided P = 0. 030) frontal plane peak moments during gait. Contralateral cane placement was associated with the smallest peak knee abductor (P = < 0. 001) and flexor (P = < 0. 001) moments. Knee deformity (varus or valgus) did not have any significant effect on any variable possibly due to small sample size. Interpretation. The results suggest that as is the case for the hip contralateral cane placement is the most efficacious for persons with knee osteoarthritis. In fact, no cane use may be preferable to ipsilateral cane usage as the latter resulted in the highest knee <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> <b>a</b> situation which may exacerbate pain and deformity.

In root torque, the center of rotation is at the incisal edge or at the bracket with a 12 : 1 moment to force ratio. Torque can be produced by using rectangular wire or using torquing auxiliaries.

Rehabilitation robots that {{are equipped with}} sensors are able to quantify the extent of muscle force impairment and to monitor a patient {{during the process of}} neurorehabilitation with sensitive and objective assessment methods. In this article, we provide an overview of fundamental aspects of muscle function and how the corresponding variables can be quantified by means of meaningful robotic assessments that are primarily oriented towards upper limb neurorehabilitation. We discuss new concepts for the assessment of muscle function, and present an overview of the currently available systems for upper limb measurements.
