40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} hotspot stresses in multiplanar tubular XT-joints {{has been conducted}} in which 180 finite element analyses were performed. The study covers {{a wide range of}} joint geometries under various combinations of axial forces. The results of the analyses are presented as a set of equations expressing the stress concentration factor {{as a function of the}} relevant geometric parameters for various combinations of axial forces. A typical full-size steel multiplanar XT-joint was selected for experimental testing to verify the numerical analyses. A comparison is also made between the results obtained for multiplanar tubular XT-joints and those of the corresponding uniplanar T- and X-joints. It is found that, when all the braces of the multiplanar XT-joints are loaded simultaneously, the <b>multiplanar</b> <b>effect</b> is significant. When the out-of-plane braces are not loaded, the <b>multiplanar</b> <b>effect</b> is insignificant for small Î² value when the comparison in made between the multiplanar XT-joints with uniplanar T-joints. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, 20 multiplanar DX-joints (double X) with {{in-plane}} braces and out-of-plane braces {{subjected to}} various combination of axial loads were analyzed. The <b>multiplanar</b> <b>effect</b> of loaded and unloaded out-of-plane braces and the load-interaction of multiplanar DX-joints were investigated. The influence of geometric parameters on the stress concentration factors of the joints was also studied. The results {{obtained from the}} analyses of multiplanar DX-joints are {{compared with those of}} the corresponding uniplanar X-joints. It is found that, when the out-of-plane braces are not loaded, the <b>multiplanar</b> <b>effect</b> is not significant when the brace diameter is much smaller than the chord diameter. When the out-of-plane braces are loaded, the hot spot stresses are found to be lower or higher than the values predicted based on uniplanar joints. The deviation can be as much as 87 % or 94 %, respectively, depending on the combination of the load conditions and geometrical parameters. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
