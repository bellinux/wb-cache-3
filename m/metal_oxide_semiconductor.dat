Currently, when the demand for energy is increasing, the manufacture of cheap and durable solar cells is an essential requirement.

40|$|Solution {{processed}} <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>semiconductors</b> {{have attracted}} intensive {{attention in the}} last several decades and have emerged as a promising candidate for the application of thin film transistor (TFT) due to their nature of transparency, flexibility, high mobility, simple processing technique and potential low manufacturing cost. However, <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> thin film fabricated by solution process usually requires a high temperature (over 300 ï¿½C), which is above the glass transition temperature of some conventional polymer substrates. In order to fabricate the flexible electronic device on polymer substrates, it is necessary to find a facile approach to lower the fabrication temperature and minimize defects in <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> thin film. In this thesis, the electrical properties dependency on temperature is discussed and an UV-assisted annealing method incorporating Deep ultraviolet (DUV) -decomposable additives is demonstrated, which can effectively improve electrical properties solution processed <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>semiconductors</b> processed at temperature as low as 220 ï¿½C. By studying a widely used indium oxide (In 2 O 3) TFT as a model system, it is worth noted that compared with the sample without UV treatment, the linear mobility and saturation mobility of UV-annealing sample are improved by 56 % and 40 % respectively. Meanwhile, the subthreshold swing is decreased by 32 %, indicating UV-treated device could turn on and off more efficiently. In addition to pure In 2 O 3 film, the similar phenomena have also been observed in indium oxide based Indium-Gallium-Zinc Oxide (IGZO) system.

30|$|Much {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} fabricating high-efficiency photocatalytic materials, {{which is one of the}} most potential routes to mitigating environmental pollution [1]. Among them, <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>semiconductors,</b> such as ZnO and TiO 2, have attracted much attention owing to their high efficiency in the degradation of wide-ranged pollutants in which electron–hole pairs are generated under irradiation and degrade the pollutants absorbed on the surface of the photocatalytic materials [2 – 5]. Most of the <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>semiconductors</b> have large band gaps, for example, 3.2 [*]eV for ZnO [6] and 3.0 [*]eV for TiO 2 [7], which are in the range of an UV spectrum. For this kind of materials, it is hard to generate electron–hole pairs under visible light irradiation because of the low photo energy, which therefore leads to lower photocatalytic efficiency and limits their large-scale applications. Therefore, in recent years, great efforts have been devoted to develop new photocatalytic materials with high efficiency under visible light irradiation.|$|R
