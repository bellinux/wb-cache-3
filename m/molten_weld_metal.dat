40|$|Abstract. The paper {{concerns}} with welding of copper to stainless steel. Technically pure Cu and AISI 304 {{austenitic stainless steel}} with the thickness of 2. 0 mm were suggested as experimental metals. TruDisk 8002 laser with the wavelength of 1. 03 µm and a maximum power of 8. 0 kW was used for production of dissimilar metal welds. Laser power from the range of 2. 3 to 2. 9 kW and welding speed from 35 to 50 mm/s were used for welding dissimilar metals. Focal position was direct {{on the surface of}} welded metals. Helium with flow rate of 17 l/min was used for shielding of <b>molten</b> <b>weld</b> <b>metal.</b> Light microscopy, EDX microanalysis and micro hardness measurements across copper- fusion zone- stainless steel interface were performed in order to study the properties of the weld joints...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to develop a}} simple model which could be used to study {{residual}} stress. The mechanism that results in residual stresses in the welding process starts with the deposition of <b>molten</b> <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> which heats the immediately adjacent material. After solidification of weld material, normal thermal shrinkage is resisted by the adjacent, cooler material. When the thermal strain exceeds the elastic strain corresponding to the yield point stress, the stress level is limited by this value, which decreases with increasing temperature. Cooling then causes elastic unloading which is restrained by the adjoining material. Permanent plastic strain occurs, and tension is caused in the region immediately adjacent to the weld material. Compression arises in the metal farther from the weld in order to maintain overall static equilibrium. Subsequent repair welds may add to the level of residual stresses. The level of residual stress is related to the onset of fracture during welding. Thus, it is of great importance to be able to predict the level of residual stresses remaining after a weld procedure, and to determine the factors, such as weld speed, temperature, direction, and number of passes, which may affect the magnitude of remaining residual stress. It was hoped to use traditional analytical modeling techniques so that {{it would be easier to}} comprehend the effect of these variables on the resulting stress. This approach was chosen in place of finite element methods so as to facilitate the understanding of the physical processes. The accuracy of the results was checked with some existing experimental studies giving residual stress levels found from x-ray diffraction measurements...|$|E
40|$|Laser welding {{has been}} {{increasingly}} utilized to manufacture {{a variety of}} components thanks to its high quality and speed. For components with complex shapes, the welding position needs be continuously adjusted during laser welding, which makes it necessary to know {{the effects of the}} welding position {{on the quality of the}} laser welds. In this paper, the weld quality under two (flat and horizontal) welding positions were studied comparatively in the laser welding of Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy, in terms of weld profiles, process porosity, and static tensile strengths. Results show that the flat welding position led to better weld profiles, less process porosity than that of the horizontal welding position, which resulted from the different actions of gravity on the <b>molten</b> <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> and the different escape routes for pores under different welding positions. Although undercuts showed no association with the fracture positions and tensile strengths of the welds, too much porosity in horizontal laser welds led to significant decreases in the strengths and specific elongations of welds. Higher laser powers and travel speeds were recommended, for both flat and horizontal welding positions, to reduce weld porosity and improve mechanical properties...|$|R

The mechanical properties of the <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy were used {{to carry out the}} fractography investigation of the impacted specimens. In the 5 % Cr steel <b>weld</b> <b>metal,</b> it was found that M 7 C 3 and M 2 C started to precipitate during tempering at 500 °C. M 23 C 6 precipitated out from 600 °C. The composition of the precipitates also changed according to the tempering temperature. The development of microstructure during tempering was discussed. The microstructure of three 9 % Cr steel <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> consisted of lath martensite, some retained. delta. -ferrite and precipitates. The predominant precipitates were M 23 C 6. In <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> containing V and Nb, MC and M 2 C were present. The failure mode of the impacted <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> was quasi-cleavage. Non- metallic inclusions were found to be the nucleation sites for cleavage cracks during impact. The cleavage stress of the <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> was determined {{by the size of the}} inclusions and the size of martensite packets or recrystallized ferrite grains (in the case that the quantity of recrystallized ferrite was high). The impact toughness of the <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> depended on the yield stress and fracture stress of the materials. The microstructure of three varieties of 12 % Cr steel <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> consisted also of martensite, retained. delta. -ferrite and precipitates.

40|$|Hydrogen induced cold {{cracking}} in weldments {{is the most}} serious problem limiting the use of high strength low alloy steel in the structural industry. Improvement of the weldability of structural steel has significantly reduced the risk of {{cold cracking}} in the heat affected zone. Consequently, the avoidance of <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> cold cracking becomes a major task since the risk of hydrogen induced cold cracking in the HAZ is greatly diminished in modem low carbon steels. Hydrogen induced cold cracking in <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> is caused by the complex interaction of the diffusible hydrogen content, residual stress and susceptible microstructure. Depending on the joint geometry which induces stresses, cold cracking in <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> can be of two types with respect to the welding direction: longitudinal cracking which is parallel to the welding direction, and transverse cracking which is perpendicular to the welding direction. Weld deposits for high strength low alloy steels can be susceptible to transverse cold cracking. The investigation described in this thesis involved the use of the gapped bead-on-plate (G-BOP) test to examine the effect of shielding gas mixture and preheat temperature on <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> transverse cold cracking behaviour in a flux cored arc welded BIS 812 EMA quenched and tempered steel. The minimum yield stress of BIS 812 EMA steel 1 s 690 MPa. The consumable used in welding was a low hydrogen flux cored wire. Literature relevant to the characteristics of <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> cold cracking has been reviewed, with emphasis on the factors affecting hydrogen induced cold cracking. The process of flux cored arc welding, the weld thermal cycle and the properties of <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> have been examined. The main types of cold cracking and relevant weldability tests have been discussed. Two different Ar-C 02 shielding gas mixtures (Ar- 5 %C 02 and Ar- 20 %C 02) and five different preheat temperatures (20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, 80 °C and 100 °C) were used at an aim heat input of 1. 7 kJ/mm to investigate the effect of welding conditions on the transverse cold cracking behaviour of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited on BIS 812 EMA steel. The microstructures, hardness values and fracture surfaces of the <b>weld</b> <b>metals,</b> have been examined in detail using optical and electron microscopy and microhardness testing. The characteristics of non-metallic inclusions in the <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> have been determined using scanning electron microscopy and automatic image analysis. The continuous cooling transformation diagrams of the base <b>metal</b> and the <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> have been developed using dilatometry and microstructural observation. Additionally, precipitation hardening by alloy carbides has been studied by tempering of <b>weld</b> <b>metals.</b> It was found that, below a critical preheat temperature, <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> transverse cracks developed in the self restrained G-BOP test at least five minutes after welding and initiated below 150 °C, confirming that the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> transverse cracking was cold cracking. Shielding with Ar- 20 %C 02 mixture resulted in significantly lower susceptibility to transverse cold cracking than shielding with Ar- 5 %C 02 mixture. However, the microstructures of the <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> deposited with the two different Ar-C 02 shielding gas mixtures were similar and mainly consisted of acicular ferrite and bainitic ferrite. Comparing the two <b>weld</b> <b>metals,</b> the higher oxygen potential of the Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture caused reduction of hardenability elements such as carbon, boron, manganese and silicon in the weld metal; and the higher oxygen absorption during welding resulted in a higher non-metallic inclusion volume fraction and a slightly larger mean particle size and number of particles per unit volume. These factors led to phase transformation during cooling at higher temperature in <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02, a slightly coarser microstructure with more bainitic ferrite, and a significantly lower hardness than the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02. In addition, the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture had a lower diffusible hydrogen level and less nitrogen in solid solution. These characteristics combined with the lower hardness value of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> are considered to be the main factors contributing to the lower susceptibility to transverse cold cracking in the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 compared with Ar- 5 %C 02 under the same welding conditions. Three types of fracture morphologies were found {{to be associated with the}} <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> transverse cold cracking: microvoid coalescence (MVC) fracture, quasi-cleavage (QC) fracture and intergranular (IG) fracture. IG was more prevalent in the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02 shielding gas mixture while MVC dominated in the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02. These trends are consistent with the difference in <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> hardness (strength). The susceptibility to <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> transverse cold cracking, based on the G-BOP test, decreased with increasing preheat temperature for both shielding gas mixtures. No cracking was observed for the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture for a preheat of 40 °C, but a preheat of 100 °C was required for crack-free welding using Ar- 5 %C 02 shielding gas mixture. However, it is concluded that the finer microstructure of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02 is capable of both higher strength and lower cold cracking susceptibility than the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 provided the hardnesses are similar and below a critical level of about 290 HV...|$|R

Moreover, KIH value of high toughness <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> (KIH value is about 90 MPa√m) was higher than that of low toughness (KIH value is about 70 MPa√m) at RT. However, KIH value of low toughness <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> was the similar level (KIH value is about 110 MPa√m) of high toughness <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> at 150 ̊C...|$|R
40|$|Department of Nuclear EngineeringIn {{the primary}} coolant {{system of the}} {{pressurized}} water reactor, austenitic Ni-base <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> are deposited on low-alloy steel to form dissimilar <b>metal</b> <b>weld</b> joints. An example is the weld joint between head penetration nozzle (austenitic Ni-base alloy) and reactor pressure vessel (low-alloy steel). Leakage issues from Alloy 82 / 182 Ni-base <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> have frequently been reported since 2000. In addition, the cumulative number of cracked welds increased with the operation time of the pressurized water reactors. Recently, the Ni-base <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> was replaced from Alloy 82 / 182 (about 15 wt. ...|$|R

These diagrams will assist welding engineers, welding metallurgists and welding-consumables designers in industry as well as those investigating steel <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> phase transformation kinetics...|$|R
50|$|The {{dilution}} in welding {{terms is}} defined as the weight of the base metal melted divided by the total weight of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal.</b> For example, if we have a dilution of 0.40, the fraction of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> that came from the consumable electrode is 0.60.|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic {{inspections}} of {{austenitic stainless steel}} <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> are particularly difficult because of the dendritic structure and anisotropy of the material. The acoustic properties of stainless steel <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> are discussed. Data on frequency spectra and variations in longitudinal and shear velocities with wave-propagation direction are presented. The difference in detectability of artificial reflectors using shear waves of varying polarization is presented, and it is demonstrated that, in some cases, horizontally polarized shear waves can detect a reflector in the <b>weld</b> <b>metal,</b> whereas the traditional vertically polarized shear waves cannot...|$|R
30|$|Corrosion is also {{promoted}} by the pitting action and the ionisation tendency between the copper and aluminium, which consequently results in a smaller contact surface area. The small contact area between the metals leads to loosened {{connection between the two}} metals and produces noise during the arcing (Solacity, 2011). In a friction-stir welded joint, galvanic corrosion occurs at the interface region of the weld due to the high-temperature gradient, which results in degradation of the joint properties. In addition, high-temperature corrosion can occur due to significant difference in the chemical composition of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal.</b> When the dissimilar <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> operates at high temperatures, oxidation occurs due to the variation in the composition of the <b>weld</b> <b>metals.</b> This oxidation leads to notches in the <b>weld</b> <b>metal,</b> which act as stress raisers (Joseph 2006).|$|R

In order to achieve the required high strength and toughness to match those of the parent pipe, girth <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> have to rely mostly on their composition. The aim {{of the present study}} was to characterise the influence of the consumable chemistry and moisture content, and the welding parameters on the composition of <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> produced by E 8010 and E 9010 shielded metal arc (SMA) cellulosic consumables. The alloying compounds in the consumable coating were isolated using a caustic soda solution, analysed with electron backscattered diffraction and identified as a variety of oxides. Making use of a mechanised SMA welding machine, the effect on <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> alloying element contents of the welding conditions was evaluated. Smaller welding arc voltages and lower consumable coating moisture content produced <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> with richer chemistry. The element transfer mechanisms from the consumable coating to the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> are also discussed. N. Coniglio, V. Linton and E. Gambo...|$|R
40|$|The {{variation}} of the Mn-depleted zone (MDZ) around the inclusion during multi-pass welding of Ti-containing high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steel was investigated by taking {{the changes in the}} impact toughness and microstructure into account. As-deposited <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> specimens were prepared by single-pass, bead-in-groove welding, and reheated <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> specimens were obtained by a thermal simulation technique. Two types of chemical compositions were prepared, mainly by controlling the Ti content in order to form two types of phases at inclusion/matrix interface: spinel and ilmenite. When the reheating thermal cycle is applied to the as-deposited <b>weld</b> <b>metal,</b> the MDZ depth varied depending on the inclusion surface phase; this could be explained by the competition of the homogenization effect and the dissolution effect, which occurred near the inclusion/matrix interface. In order to enhance the chemical driving force for intragranular nucleation in both as-deposited <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> and reheated <b>weld</b> <b>metal,</b> the formation of ilmenite phase is recommended.
