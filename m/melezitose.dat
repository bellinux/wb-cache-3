Reaction mechanisms are elucidated by heat treatment of pure <b>melezitose</b> and trehalulose with subsequent analysis of the resultant reaction products. The rate of thermochemical degradation in the case of trehalulose is of sufficient magnitude that its concentration on the cotton surface may be substantially decreased under controlled conditions of heat and time. The rate of degradation of <b>melezitose</b> is nearly an order of magnitude smaller, and its concentration on the cotton surface is not substantially affected under similar conditions.

40|$|To {{meet their}} {{carbohydrate}} requirements, adult parasitoids exploit {{a broad range}} of sugar resources, including floral and extrafloral nectar and honeydew. Although honeydew might be the predominant sugar source, especially in agricultural systems, it often is nutritionally inferior to sugar sources like nectar. Given its broad availability, it may be expected that sugar-feeding insects have evolved specialized adaptations to deal with this typically inferior sugar source. This would apply especially to organisms that have a close association with honeydew producers. Here, we hypothesized that parasitoids of honeydew-producing insects should show a pronounced response to sugars, such as fructose, sucrose, <b>melezitose,</b> and trehalose, {{and to a lesser extent}} glucose. To test this hypothesis, we investigated sugar consumption, feeding behavior and survival of the aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi on several sugars (equiweight solutions). Our results show that A. ervi adults consumed typical honeydew sugars (sucrose, fructose, trehalose, and <b>melezitose)</b> the most, while consuming considerably less glucose or melibiose. Rhamnose, which does not occur in aphid honeydew, was not, or was only marginally, consumed. When different sugars were provided at the same time, A. ervi adults preferred sucrose or fructose over glucose or <b>melezitose.</b> Furthermore, pre-exposure to sucrose or fructose significantly reduced subsequent intake of glucose, suggesting an acquired distaste for glucose after being previously exposed to highly preferred sugars such as sucrose and fructose. Altogether, this study shows that A. ervi adults prefer sugars (fructose, <b>melezitose,</b> trehalose, and sucrose) that are overrepresented in aphid honeydew and show a lower preference to one (glucose) that is underrepresented in honeydew...|$|E

40|$|Although much {{research}} has been conducted on blood-meal acquisition in adult female black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae), the same cannot be said for sugarmeals. Both sexes feed on sugar which provides energy for flight and it has been commonly held that nectar is the major carbohydrate source. This thesis addresses the question of whether a non-floral carbohydrate source, specifically homopteran honeydew, is ingested by male and female black flies. Black flies reared in the laboratory have been observed to readily ingest freshly excreted and older (dry) honeydew when presented with honeydew coated tamarack branches. Field work was conducted in Algonquin Park, Ontario {{in the spring and summer}} of 1993. Three separate studies were designed to test whether homopteran honeydew is an important carbohydrate source for black flies and whether flies from different habitats utilize different sugar sources. The sugars <b>melezitose</b> and / or stachyose are known to occur in a variety of homopteran honeydews and therefore were used as indicators of honeydew feeding by black flies. In the first study, black flies were collected with insect nets from a stand of Larix larcina heavily infested with honeydew - producing homopterans (Adelges lariciatus). Six black fly species were captured: Simulium venustum, S. rostra tum, S. vittatum, Stegopterna mutata, S. aureum and S. quebecense. Samples of honeydew and individual black flies were tested using thin layer chromatography (T. L. C.) with fructose, glucose, sucrose, turanose, <b>melezitose,</b> raffinose and stachyose as standards. All sugars except turanose and <b>melezitose</b> were found in the adelgid honeydew samples. Since the sugar <b>melezitose</b> was absent from ~ honeydew samples, stachyose was used to indicate that black flies were feeding from this particular honeydew source. Of the 201 black flies tested, 194 contained sugars which occurred in 16 combinations. Stachyose combinations excluding <b>melezitose,</b> present in 45. 9 % of flies, were used to indicate that black flies had been feeding on the adelgid honeydew. In the second study, black flies were collected in the morning and evening on 8 collection dates, using a vehicle mounted insect net. The crops and midguts of 10 male and 10 female Simulium venustum were dissected on each sample date. In total the gut contents of 320 individual flies were analysed by T. L. C. The sugars identified from these flies were present in the following proportions: fructose (100. 0 %), glucose (100. 0 %), sucrose/turanose (50. 4 %), <b>melezitose</b> (30. 3 %), raffinose (18. 8 %) and stachyose (8. 7 %). These sugars occurred in fourteen different combinations. It is argued that the presence of <b>melezitose</b> and / or stachyose indicates that black flies had fed on homopteran honeydew. Significantly more female flies (40. 0 %) than male flies (27. 5 %) had fed on honeydew. In the third study, adult black flies were sampled by sweep netting vegetation in four habitats in the morning and evening on 8 collection dates. The habitats are as follows: (1) Davies Bog, (2) Abandoned Air Field (dominated by blueberries, Vaccinium spp.), (3) Deciduous Habitat and (4) Coniferous Habitat. Sugars in the crops and midguts of female flies were tested by T. L. C. and, for S. venustum, it was found that significantly fewer flies (18. 8 %) from the Air Field contained honeydew than from the other three sites (Davies Bog, 34. 4 %; Deciduous Habitat, 36. 2 %; Coniferous Habitat, 25. 0 %). Of the 1287 black flies tested individually by T. L. C. 441 (34. 3 %) contained <b>melezitose</b> and / or stachyose sugars indicating that this proportion of the population were feeding from Homopteran honeydew.

40|$|Many aphids {{are known}} {{to engage in a}} trophic {{mutualism}} with ants, whereby the aphids secrete sugary rich honeydew which is collected by the ants for food, and the ants, in exchange, protect the aphids against natural enemies. Previous results, however, suggest that the production of some of the honeydew sugars, such as the ant-attractant trisaccharide <b>melezitose,</b> may induce an indirect cost to the aphids. This led us to believe that large differences {{in the nature of the}} secreted honeydew might exist, due to some clones capitalizing more or less on their mutualistic interaction with ants, or due to some ‘‘cheater’’ clones foregoing the production of particular sugars, instead taking advantage of the ant-attracting effect of other non sugar-deficient clones, co-occurring on the same plant. Here we present data on clonal variation in the composition of honeydew of the black bean aphid Aphis fabae which confirm this prediction. In particular, our results show that there was large interclone variation in the amount of glucose, <b>melezitose</b> and total sugar produced. The variation in the production of <b>melezitose,</b> however, showed particularly large differences, with 54 % (7 out of 13) of the clones screened being virtually deficient for the production of this sugar, irrespective of whether the aphid colonies were ant-tended or not. The consequences of this finding in the context of the evolution and maintenance of the ant–aphid mutualism, as well as the adaptive benefits of oligosaccharide synthesis in aphids and other insects are discussed. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Honeydew is the {{keystone}} on which ant-aphid mutualism is built. The present study investigates how each sugar identified in Aphis fabae Scopoli honeydew acts upon the feeding and the laying of a recruitment trail by scouts of the aphidtending ant Lasius niger Linnaeus, and thus may enhance collective exploitation by the ant mutualists. The feeding preferences shown by L. niger for honeydew sugars are: <b>melezitose</b> = sucrose = raffinose > glucose = fructose > maltose = trehalose = melibiose = xylose. Although feeding {{is a prerequisite}} to the launching of trail recruitment, the reverse is not necessarily true: not all ingested sugar solutions elicit a trail-laying behaviour among fed scouts. Trail mark laying is only triggered by raffinose, sucrose or <b>melezitose,</b> with the latter sugar being specific to honeydew. By comparing gustatory and recruitment responses of ant foragers to sugar food sources, the present study clarifies the role of honeydew composition both {{as a source of}} energy and as a mediator in ant-aphid interactions. Lasius niger feeding preferences can be related to the physiological suitability of each sugar (i. e. their detection by gustatory receptors as well as their ability to be digested and converted into energy). Regarding recruitment, the aphid-synthesized oligosaccharide (<b>melezitose)</b> could be used by ant scouts as a cue indicative of a long-lasting productive resource that is worthy of collective exploitation and defence against competitors or aphid predators. © 2010 The Authors.

However, the atypical isolates differ from C. tropicalis by their inability to ferment sucrose or <b>melezitose</b> and from the sucrose-negative variants by their inability to assimilate inulin and their varied utilization of other carbon substrates...|$|E
40|$|The AGT 1 {{permease}} is a K-glucoside-H symporter {{responsible for}} the active transport of maltose, trehalose, maltotriose, K-methylglucoside, <b>melezitose</b> and sucrose. In wild-type {{as well as in}} MAL constitutive strains, K-methylglucoside seemed to be the best inducer of transport activity, while trehalose had no inducing effect. Based on the initial rates of transport it seems that the sugar preferentially transported by this permease is trehalose, followed by sucrose. z 1999 Federation of Europea...|$|E
40|$|Members of {{the genus}} Bifidobacterium are {{commonly}} found in the gastrointestinal tracts of mammals, including humans, where their growth is presumed {{to be dependent on}} various diet- and/or host-derived carbohydrates. To understand transcriptional control of bifidobacterial carbohydrate metabolism, we investigated two genetic carbohydrate utilization clusters dedicated to the metabolism of raffinose-type sugars and <b>melezitose.</b> Transcriptomic and gene inactivation approaches revealed that the raffinose utilization system is positively regulated by an activator protein, designated RafR. The gene cluster associated with <b>melezitose</b> metabolism was shown to be subject to direct negative control by a LacI-type transcriptional regulator, designated MelR 1, in addition to apparent indirect negative control by means of a second LacI-type regulator, MelR 2. In silico analysis, DNA-protein interaction, and primer extension studies revealed the MelR 1 and MelR 2 operator sequences, each of which is positioned just upstream of or overlapping the correspondingly regulated promoter sequences. Similar analyses identified the RafR binding operator sequence located upstream of the rafB promoter. This study indicates that transcriptional control of gene clusters involved in carbohydrate metabolism in bifidobacteria is subject to conserved regulatory systems, representing either positive or negative control...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 215 typical strains of Candida albicans were studied {{for their ability}} to {{assimilate}} 11 carbon compounds. All isolates assimilated lactic acid, ribitol, succinic acid, methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside. None of the isolates assimilated cellobiose and salicin; 1. 9 % of the isolates assimilated L-arabinose. Citric acid, glycerol, and L-sorbose were assimilated by greater than 97 % of the isolates, whereas <b>melezitose</b> was assimilated by 81 % of the isolates. Assimilation results depended on duration of incubation, temperature, and methodology...|$|E
