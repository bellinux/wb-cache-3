500|$|... "Hair" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Gaga and RedOne, {{and the name}} of the song was revealed through an interview with Vogue magazine in February 2011. On The Graham Norton Show, Gaga explained the origin of the song, which involves the analogy of her hair with freedom, and how that is the only part of her body she can change without anyone judging her. According to a press listening in February, [...] "Hair" [...] draws inspiration from Pat Benatar's '80s classic [...] "We Belong", while thematically focusing on empowering lyrics similar to those of [...] "Born This Way". Gaga elaborated on the song's inspiration further with a video posted on her Twitter account: [...] "When I was a kid, I used to always come down the stairs of my parents' house, and they would say, 'Go back upstairs and brush your hair, change your clothes, you can't go out wearing that', and I felt like it was stifling my identity... <b>My</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> my glory. It was the only thing that I could change about myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the video, Jackson shows {{a sexual}} {{attraction}} towards the dancing woman—played by Sybil Azur. Jackson caresses her ankle, calf, knee and thigh, {{and at one}} stage looks up her dress. The woman is then seen opening a flick knife as the pair engage in a final courtship dance. The video closes {{in the same manner}} it began, with the switchblade impaling the spray painted image. The music video won the Brazilian TVZ Video Award: Best International Music Video of the Year. Interviewed on her experience during the video one of the dancers, Carmit Bachar (of The Pussycat Dolls) noted, [...] "I was called in by Vincent Paterson for 'Blood on the Dance Floor'. It was to have a Latin feel, some sort of mambo. I arrived wearing a little salsa dress, fish nets, heels, and <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> up in a kind of bun with a flower. I was 'camera ready'. I showed up with the whole outfit. It's not that producers can't see what they like, or the potential in somebody, but what I do helps them to see their vision more".|$|E
500|$|Michell {{attempted}} {{to be as}} faithful to the novel as possible, in particular avoiding what he felt was the polished, artificial feel of other period dramas set in the 19th-century. The director explained, [...] "I was desperately {{trying to make it}} feel like it could be happening in the next room. I tried to make it something which is absolutely about real people and not about dressing or hairstyles or carpet". Consequently, because he felt the realistic look of the age would make the film more dramatic, Michell chose to depict the actors without make-up, and disallowed them from looking too hygienic. Root commented about the film's natural look in an interview, [...] "I basically didn't wear any makeup , and <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> obviously set in a very unflattering way... I suppose the lighting was quite harsh, as well. None of us looked good". She said in a separate interview, [...] "I wanted to make Anne Elliot a somewhat plain woman who was not really miserable but had found a way to be content somehow, and yet emotions are buzzing around her all the time". Root believed the film's realistic depiction of the age was a key aspect of its appeal.|$|E

2500|$|The taping {{was done}} in {{sequence}} and there were rarely any retakes because the producers were strict. Priscilla Barnes once said, [...] "Our bosses were very, very controlling. If <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> too blonde, I'd get called up in the office." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1913, Pound was {{contacted}} by the widow of the recently deceased Orientalist Ernest Fenollosa, who while in Japan had collected word-by-word translations and notes for 150 classical Chinese poems that fit in closely with this program. Chinese grammar offers different expressive possibilities from English grammar, a point that Pound subsequently made much of. For example, in Chinese, {{the first line of}} Li Po's (called [...] "Rihaku" [...] by Fenollosa's Japanese informants) poem [...] is a spare, direct juxtaposition of 5 characters that appear in Fenollosa's notes as mistress [...] hair [...] first [...] cover [...] browIn his resulting 1915 Cathay, Pound rendered this in simple English as While <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> still cut straight across my forehead ...|$|E
2500|$|Nick was not {{away from}} Walford for long. In 1991, he {{returned}} with a heroin addiction but Dot initially shunned him and ignored his pleas for help. It was only after discovering Charlie had died that Nick was her only family left and was determined to reform him. Discussing the storyline, Altman has said: [...] "I found the heroin addiction quite exhausting actually, because I grew a really thick beard and <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> always really filthy. When I was shooting those scenes I met {{with a guy who}} was an addict, and he told me things that you go through, like you can’t relax when you’re trying to come off it. You can‘t sleep so you drink loads of alcohol to try and kill the pain. The clock barely seems to move. For me as an actor, they really let me go as far as I could on that. We had letters as well from people saying how it‘s put them off heroin for life, so I guess we did a good job." [...] As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go cold turkey with the help of Pete Beale. During this period, The Queen Victoria landlord Eddie Royle is murdered. The murder was the key storyline of the show during the autumn of 1991. The episode Eddie was murdered was written by Tony McHale, it finished with a cliffhanger featuring Clyde Tavernier in the gardens standing over Eddie's body and holding a knife, which Nick witnessed from his bedroom window. Nick tells the police what he saw, leading to Clyde going on the run with the help of Michelle Fowler. Joe Wallace eventually came forward, saying he saw Nick out on the square on the night of Eddie’s murder, having escaped his room and climbed down a drain pipe. Nick confesses to Dot that he was responsible but insists that it was an accident. Nick is subsequently arrested and charged with Eddie’s murder and he stands trial in January 1993. A week's worth of episodes were devoted to the trial, and were all written by Tony Jordan. To present the story of Nick's trial the programme-makers themselves had to review the evidence and watch the episodes leading up to the death of Eddie. In the end, although it was clear that Nick was responsible for stabbing Eddie, it was not clear that it was murder and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Altman summarised: [...] "Through having a really good defence and lying his head off once again, he got away with murder".|$|E
