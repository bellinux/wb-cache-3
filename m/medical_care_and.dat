5|$|About {{one percent}} of people who receive {{treatment}} for MTBI need surgery for a brain injury. Observation to monitor for worsening condition {{is an important part of}} treatment. Health care providers recommend that those suffering from concussion return for further <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> evaluation 24 to 72hours after the concussive event if the symptoms worsen. Athletes, especially intercollegiate or professional, are typically followed closely by team athletic trainers during this period but others may not have access to this level of health care and may be sent home with minimal monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Life in a workhouse was {{intended}} to be harsh, to deter the able-bodied poor and to ensure that only the truly destitute would apply. But in areas such as the provision of free <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education for children, neither of which was available to the poor in England living outside workhouses until the early 20th century, workhouse inmates were advantaged over the general population, a dilemma that the Poor Law authorities never managed to reconcile.|$|E
40|$|ELSIのSは『社会的』との意味である。しかしながら，医療や医学での社会的問題とは如何なる側面を指すのかはあまり明らかではない。第Ⅱ報では倫理という概念について議論したが，本稿では『社会的』とは如何なる概念であるかを考える。今回，医療・医学の進歩と市民社会の成立という新機軸(今までには存在しなかった新しい方法や状況) を比較しつつ考察する。どうやらELSIの社会とは，辞書的な社会とはややニュアンスを異にした概念であるようだ。また，市民社会にはそれを支える社会規範より上位に立つ基本的な哲学(本稿では人権尊重と経済的自由主義を取り上げる) が存在するが，医療・医学でのELSIには未だそれに比肩するほどの成熟は見られない。S of ELSI is the meanig of "social". However, it is {{not clear}} what "social" means in <b>medical</b> <b>cares</b> <b>and</b> medicine. We argued about the concept of ethics in the second report. In this reoport we argued about "social". And in this report we {{compared}} the progression of <b>medical</b> <b>cares</b> <b>and</b> medicine with the formation of civilian society, which are both, what we call innovation. "Social" of ELSI seems to be the concept that differs from lexical "social" in a nuance a little somehow or other. In addition, there are basic philosophies (I took up respects of human rights and economic liberalism in this report) in civilian society to support itself, which are in higher rank than in social norms, but ELSI in <b>medical</b> <b>cares</b> <b>and</b> medicine has been immature...|$|R

5|$|Many {{buildings}} did {{not hold}} up to the shaking of the earthquake and those that did collapse often lacked any survival space, but lack of effective <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> poor planning {{also contributed to the}} substantial scope of the disaster. Buildings that didn't collapse featured well-maintained masonry and skeletal components that were joined together adequately in a way that allowed for the building to resist seismic waves. Most bridges and tunnels and other public infrastructure withstood the earthquake but hospitals did not fare well. Most collapsed, killing two-thirds of the doctors, destroying equipment and medicine, and reducing the capacity to handle the critical medical needs in the region.|$|E

5|$|A harsh anti-union clampdown {{followed}} the Haymarket incident. There {{was a massive}} outpouring of community and business support for the police and many thousands of dollars were donated to funds for their <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> to assist their efforts. The entire labor and immigrant community, particularly Germans and Bohemians, came under suspicion. Police raids were carried out on homes and offices of suspected anarchists. Scores of suspects, many only remotely related to the Haymarket affair, were arrested. Casting legal requirements such as search warrants aside, Chicago police squads subjected the labor activists of Chicago to an eight-week shakedown, ransacking their meeting halls and places of business. The emphasis was on the speakers at the Haymarket rally and the newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung. A small group of anarchists were discovered to {{have been engaged in}} making bombs on the same day as the incident, including round ones like the one used in Haymarket Square.|$|E

Each of the band members sings, and all but one also play acoustic guitar. In addition, the band makes use of traditional instruments like the kabosy guitar and sodina flute. While the band is acclaimed for its large catalog of hits, with over 300 songs composed since 1972, its members are also admired for their commitment to live the message of solidarity for national development that features in most of their music. Each band member has gone on to cultivate a primary career in addition to his participation in Mahaleo in areas ranging from <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> sociology to farming and politics. The band has collectively launched two development initiatives, in addition to numerous other activities managed by individual members of the group.|$|E

5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of the bite; the majority of cases do not require <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and routine analgesics. Hospital assessment is recommended if simple analgesia does not resolve local pain or clinical features of systemic envenoming occur. In more severe bites, Redback antivenom can be given. Redback antivenom can also cross-neutralise katipo venom, and it is used to treat envenoming from Latrodectus katipo in New Zealand. It is available from most major New Zealand hospitals. Antivenom will usually relieve symptoms of systemic envenoming and is indicated in anyone suffering symptoms consistent with Latrodectus envenoming. Unlike some other antivenoms, it is not limited to patients with signs of severe, systemic envenoming. Particular indications for using antivenom are local then generalised pain, sweating or hypertension. However, good evidence to support the effectiveness of widow spider antivenoms is lacking and studies have cast some doubt on antivenoms efficacy in latrodectism. Pain relief agents, such as parenteral opiates, or benzodiazepines may be required as adjunct agents.|$|E
