This volcanism is indicated by the presence of a bentonite layer between the <b>Middle</b> <b>and</b> Upper Reptile Horizons.

The lower <b>Middle</b> <b>and</b> Lower Reptile Horizons also include the mixosaurian Phalarodon cf. fraasi, the primitive ichthyosaur Xinminosaurus catactes, the placodont Placodus inexpectatus, the nothosaurs Lariosaurus hongguoensis and Nothosaurus yangjuanensis, and the archosaur Qianosuchus mixtus, alongside bivalves and saurichthyid fish.|$|E
