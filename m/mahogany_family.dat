5000|$|Azadirachta is a genus of {{two species}} of trees in the <b>mahogany</b> (Meliaceae) <b>family.</b> Numerous species have been {{proposed}} for the genus but only two are currently recognized, Azadirachta excelsa and the economically important tree Azadirachta indica.

40|$|AbstractDrug {{resistance}} to human infectious diseases caused by pathogens lead to premature deaths through out the world. Plants are sources for {{wide variety of}} drugs used for treating various diseases. Systematic screening of medicinal plants for the search of new antimicrobial drug candidates that can inhibit the growth of pathogens or kill with no toxicity to host is being continued by many laboratories. Here we review the phytochemical investigations and biological activities of Meliaceae. The <b>mahogany</b> (Meliaceae) is <b>family</b> of timber trees with rich source for limonoids. So far, amongst the different members of Meliaceae, Azadirachta indica and Melia dubia {{have been identified as}} the potential plant systems possessing a vast array of biologically active compounds which are chemically diverse and structurally complex. Despite biological activities on different taxa of Meliaceae have been carried out, the information of antibacterial and antifungal activity is a meager with exception to Azadirachta indica. Together we provide new insights of Meliaceae members demonstrating as a potential source as antimicrobial agents using in vitro studies...|$|R
5000|$|Frontera Corozal {{is located}} in the Lacandon Jungle where it borders the Usumacinta River and the {{northern}} edge of the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve. The surrounding ecosystem is perennial tropical rainforest with plant species such as palms, oak, cedar, <b>mahogany,</b> Platymiscium (legume <b>family),</b> sapodilla (Manilkara zapota), rubber trees, pine, cypress, romerillo (a type of conifer), Montezuma cypress, manchineel, ficus and guarumbo (Cecropia) [...] Wildlife species include wild boar, bats, deer, skunks, pumas, turtles and various types of snakes and birds. However, the rainforest area has been badly damaged due to overexploitation and clearing. In early 2011, over 600 communal farmers from the area entered into an agreement with the government to conserve the environment on their lands in exchange for payment under the Reducción de Emisiones por Deforestación y Degradación Evitada plus (REDD+) plan. The communal land owners created seven reserves on their lands. In exchange, each member of the communal organization received 2,000 pesos as a first payment, brought personally by the state’s governor, Juan Sabines Guerrero. The agreement calls for monthly payments as well as assistance in creating tourism opportunities and groves of palm oil trees on non reserve lands.|$|R
