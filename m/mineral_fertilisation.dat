By this work, we evaluated the effects of humic acids from Leonardite and NPK <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilisation</b> on As mobility and availability to carrot plants grown for 60 days in a volcanic soil irrigated with As-contaminated water e representing the most common scenario occurring in As-affected Italian areas. As expected, the irrigation with As-contaminated water caused a serious toxic effect on plant growth and photosynthetic rate; {{the highest rate of}} As also inhibited soil enzymatic activity. In contrast, the organic and <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilisation</b> alleviated, at least partially, the toxicity of As, essentially by stimulating plant growth and promoting nutrient uptake. The mobility of As in the volcanic soil and thus its phytoavailability were differently affected by the organic and mineral fertilisers; the application of humic acids mitigated the availability of the contaminant, likely by its partial immobilisation on humic acid sorption sites e thus raising up the intrinsic anionic sorption capacity of the volcanic soil; the <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilisation</b> enhanced the mobility of As in soil, probably due to competition of P for the anionic sorption sites of the soil variable-charge minerals, very affine to available P.

40|$|To reduce (P) {{surpluses}} on {{dairy farms}} {{and thereby the}} risk of P losses to natural waters we studied different management alternatives by a nutrient balance model described in the companion paper. The strategies evaluated mitigating the P surpluses were: <b>mineral</b> P <b>fertilisation,</b> dietary <b>mineral</b> P supplementation, replacement rate, animal density, production level, feeding intensity, dietary P concentration and nutrient efficiency in crop production. Responses to several interventions (e. g. <b>mineral</b> P <b>fertilisation,</b> purchased feed P, replacement rate) {{were similar to those}} observed in Finnish field studies. Reducing or completely giving up the use of purchased mineral P fertilisers was the most efficient measure to reduce P surplus. The slope between the amount of mineral fertilisers and P surplus was 0. 98 - 0. 99 (in the field data 1. 0). Increased animal density resulted in a greater P surplus, but the slope between P input from purchased feed and surplus was considerably smaller (0. 65) than that of P fertilisation. Increasing milk yield with improved genetic potential of the cows would have minimal effects on P surplus per unit of product, but it would increase P surplus per hectare. When the intensity of energy and protein feeding was increased, P surplus rose markedly both per unit of product and hectare. This is (1) due to increased dietary P concentration and (2) due to smaller marginal production responses than those calculated from feeding standards. Reducing dietary P concentration by constraining P excess per kg milk in least-cost ration formulation improved P efficiency in milk production and dairy farming system. However, feed cost increased as low P energy (sugar-beet pulp) and protein (soybean meal) supplements are more expensive than cereal grains or rapeseed feeds. Improving the nutrient use efficiency in crop production had a strong influence in the whole-farm efficiency and P surplus. The modelling results showed that Finnish dairy farms have a great potential to improve P efficiency and reduce P losses to the environment, even by increasing production intensity (milk/ha). It is concluded that the most cost-effective scenario to mitigate P surpluses at a dairy farm would be to reduce or give up the use of mineral P as fertilisers and supplements, and to improve the use of present soil P reserves.

However in the new context of agriculture, the development of forage legumes constitutes one of the pillars for future {{livestock farming}} systems with high environmental and economical performances. Yield benefits of grass-clover mixtures are equivalent fertiliser N inputs of 150 to 350 kg/ha, and productive grass-clover mixtures can fix 100 to 380 kg N per hectare symbiotically from the atmosphere.

However, in some long-term experiments, a lack of response to soil C input levels has been observed as a consequence of saturation phenomena and/or interactions between C input and fertilisation. This paper analyses the outcomes of a long-term experiment in north-eastern Italy that started in 1966 and is still ongoing, where residue incorporation is compared with residue removal, over a range of <b>mineral</b> N <b>fertilisations.</b> A general decrease of SOC content was observed in the first 10 years of the experiment, followed by an approach to a steady state. However, SOC content differed markedly according to residue management and, in plots with residue incorporation, to N fertilisation.

The measured data were then simulated with Century, a model based on first-order decomposition kinetic, to evaluate if the data could be interpreted by this kind of decomposition process.

However, substantial amounts of N can be lost from legume-grass leys prior to or after incorporation as green manure (GM). Here we report N 2 O emissions from a field experiment in SE Norway exploring different green manure management strategies: mulching versus removal of grass-clover herbage during a whole growing season and replacement as biogas residue to a subsequent barley crop. Grass-clover ley had small but significantly higher N 2 O emissions as compared with a non-fertilized cereal reference during the year of green manure (GM) production in 2009. Mulching of herbage induced significantly more N 2 O emission (+ 0. 37 kg N 2 O-N ha − 1) throughout the growing season than removing herbage. In spring 2010 all plots were ploughed (with and without GM) and sown with barley, resulting in generally higher N 2 O emissions than during the previous year. Application of biogas residue (110 kg N ha − 1) before sowing did not increase emissions neither when applied to previous ley plots nor when applied to previously unfertilized cereal plots. Ley management (mulching vs. removing biomass in 2009) had no effect on N 2 O emissions during barley production in 2010.

Using flow-proportional water sampling, various options for mitigating subsurface P leaching losses (and N leaching) were examined in 28 experimental plots on a flat, tile-drained site with 60 % marine clay. Two crop rotations and unfertilised fallow were monitored {{for a total of}} six years. In addition to topsoil management practices (different forms of tillage, structural liming and <b>mineral</b> P <b>fertilisation),</b> local spatial variations in subsurface transport were determined within the experimental area. Mean total P (TotP) leaching losses after conventional autumn ploughing and inverting the soil to a depth of 23 cm were 0. 79 kgha− 1 year− 1, with 87 % occurring as particulate P (PP), and the corresponding mean total N leaching losses were 27 kgha− 1 year− 1, with 91 % occurring as nitrate. The coefficient of variation in TotP leaching both in spring before the experiment started (64 %) and during the six-year experiment (60 %) was higher than the coefficient of variation in P-soil status (20 %), or drainage (25 %), illustrating the importance of local-scale subsurface transport in this cracking clay. However, TotP and PP leaching losses were significantly (pr>F F< 0. 001) lower from unfertilised fallow than from other treatments and was not significantly lower after shallow autumn tillage than after conventionally ploughing, whereas PP losses tended to be higher. Infiltration measurements with tension infiltrometers revealed a high variation in saturated hydraulic conductivity within plots. In view of the generally high PP losses, efforts to combat eutrophication of the nearby Baltic Sea should concentrate on soil structure improvements, while extensive tillage and totally omitting P fertilisation of cracking soils with moderate soil P status appears to be inefficient mitigation options...|$|R

Because of the time required for implementation of the experiment and meteorological conditions, the irrigation factor was not tested for spinach (1999) and wheat (2000) cultivations. The two experimental factors were three fertilisation levels, with comparison to a reference without any mineral nitrogen supply, and irrigation with or without wastewater. These factors were assessed for their impacts on crop yields and mineral nitrogen residues in the soil after harvest. The three vegetable cultivations of bean, carrot and broad bean were irrigated and systematically presented statistically higher yields with wastewater irrigation supply than without. The fertilisation factor also significantly improved all the yields, or protein rate for cereal cultivation, except for carrot and broad bean where differences were not significant, even for the zero fertilisation rate.

Lambs were slaughtered at an average weight and age of 35. 3 kg and 156 days in the O treatment, respectively, and 35. 2 kg and 155 days in the C treatment, respectively. Sensory evaluation indicated that loin chops from the O treatment had a higher level of abnormal fat odour compared with the C treatment. Carcasses from the O treatment had a softer subcutaneous fat one among 3 years (2007) compared to the C treatment. These results are probably due to a higher proportion of white clover in the diet. Organically reared lambs did offer the slight advantage of muscle fatty acid containing a higher level of stearic acid, which may have positive effects in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in humans. This may be the result of a higher rumen bio-hydrogenation of C 18 : 3 n- 3 due to differences in the botanical composition between the O and the C pasture. Production system had no effect on the colour characteristics of the meat and subcutaneous fat, except lightness of subcutaneous dorsal fat, which was slightly higher in the O lambs. There were no differences between O and C lambs in terms of colour stability and lipid oxidation of the meat during the 6 -day refrigerated storage under gas-permeable fil...|$|R

Few studies have examined how botanical complexity of sown swards affects cow performance. A 2 -year experiment was conducted to determine how sward botanical complexity, from a monoculture of ryegrass to multi-species swards (MSS) (grasses-legumes-forb), affect pasture chemical composition and nutritive value, pasture dry matter (DM) intake, milk production and milk solids production of grazing dairy cows. Five sward species: perennial ryegrass (L as Lolium), white clover and red clover (both referred to as T as Trifolium because they were always sown together), chicory (C as Cichorium) and tall fescue (F as Festuca) were assigned to four grazing treatments by combining one (L), three (LT), four (LTC) or five (LTCF) species. Hereafter, the LT swards are called mixed swards as a single combination of ryegrass and clovers, whereas LTC and LTCF swards are called MSS as a combination of at least four species from three botanical families. The experimental area (8. 7 ha) was divided into four block replicates with a <b>mineral</b> nitrogen <b>fertilisation</b> of 75 kg N/ha per year for each treatment. In total, 13 grazing rotations were carried out by applying the same grazing calendar and the same pasture allowance of 19 kg DM/cow per day above 4 cm for all treatments. Clover represented 20 % of DM for mixed and MSS swards; chicory represented 30 % of DM for MSS and tall fescue represented 10 % of DM for LTCF swards. Higher milk production (+ 1. 1 kg/day) and milk solids production (+ 0. 08 kg/day) were observed for mixed swards than for ryegrass swards. Pasture nutritive value and pasture DM intake were unaffected by the inclusion of clover. Pasture DM, organic matter and NDF concentrations were lower for MSS than for mixed swards. Higher milk production (+ 0. 8 kg/day), milk solids production (+ 0. 04 kg/day) and pasture DM intake (+ 1. 5 kg DM/day) were observed for MSS than for mixed swards. These positive effects of MSS were observed for all seasons, but particularly during summer where chicory proportion was the highest. In conclusion, advantages of grazing MSS on cow performance were due to the cumulative effect of improved pasture nutritive value and increased pasture DM intake that raised milk production and milk solids production...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{results of a}} study on the effect of a {{reduction}} in the number of ploughings in a crop rotation on the seed weed bank in the soil are presented. The study was carried out in the second and fourth year of a crop rotation (potato- spring wheat- pea- winter wheat). A {{reduction in the number of}} ploughings to three in the crop rotation decreased weed infestation of the plough layer, whereas when only one ploughing was made there was clearly more weed diaspores in the soil than after plough tillage. In the first period of the study, the <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilisation</b> level did not differentiate the weed seed bank in the soil, whereas after the end of the rotation its significant increase was noted as a result of more intensive fertilisation. In all the experimental treatments, diaspores of Chenopodium album, Viola arvensis, Galinsoga sp. and Apera spica-venti occurred in greatest numbers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a tiered approach for addressing nutrient fate at various scales that {{makes use of}} readily available data at EU level. A {{statistical approach is used}} as a screening tool to identify catchments where nutrient losses are the highest. In a subsequent tier, a physically-based model is used to identify the major processes and pathways controlling and contributing to nutrient losses, while the farm scale model EPIC is used to elaborate appropriate farming practices to reduce pollution load without endangering the farm economic sustainability. The in-tegrated framework, and in particular tiers 1 and 3, was applied for the whole Italian territory. Tier 1 ap-proach highlighted the Po catchment as an area with high nutrient losses mostly linked to agricultural activities. The EPIC model was then applied to the Pavia region within the Po valley to evaluate the impact of a shifting from a fully <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilisation</b> strategy towards a split applica-tion in time of manure and mineral fertiliser.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the Scabiosa ochroleuca suitability for growth on heavy metals contaminated substrate obtained as a result of Zn–Pb ores exploitation and their processing. Three variants of cultivation were tested in vegetative hall conditions: post-flotation wastes (control), wastes enriched with either <b>mineral</b> <b>fertilisation</b> or with sewage sludge. The possibility of future direct use of the studied species on post-flotation settling pond was determined on the basis of biometric measurements and analysis efficiency of photosynthetic apparatus, that is, pigments content and chlorophyll a fluorescence. The results showed that untreated wastes negatively influenced on plants morphological and physiological status. On the contrary, the application of sewage sludge improved growth and development of cream scabious. Thus, not only the selection of proper plant material, tolerant to toxic levels of heavy metals and other hostile conditions, but also the waste treatment are crucial when metalliferous areas are to be reclaimed...|$|E
40|$|Among green {{technologies}} {{addressed to}} metal pollution, phytoextraction has received increasing attention {{in recent years}} as an alternative to physical and chemical methods of decontamination. Since 1998, as part of an Italian multidisciplinary research team on phytoremediation, we have been carrying out several agronomic investigations with field crops in agricultural soil and pyrite waste, both markedly contaminated by heavy metals. Phytoextraction was rarely an efficient process, requiring a long time even to remove merely the bioavailable metal fraction, but the great metal stock in roots suggests exploring the effectiveness of long-term in planta stabilisation. Poor above-ground productivity was the main factor constraining metal removals, especially in wastes. Without assisting the process, only zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn) and copper (Cu) were harvested by the canopy in substantial amounts, with an estimated maximum of ~ 8 kg of metals from an hectare base with rapeseed in the agricultural soil and only 0. 33 kg with fodder radish in pyrite waste. Root growth was a key trait in species and genotype selection, in view of the close relationship between root length and metal uptake. The auxins, humic acids and chelators tested on the model plant fodder radish generally increased metal concentrations in plant tissues, but reduced growth and removals. It is currently concluded that phytoremediation efficiency with crop species may be improved through increased productivity by suitable soil management, involving <b>mineral</b> and organic <b>fertilisation,</b> contaminant dilution, soil capping, and metal immobilisation with inorganics and biochar. © T.

40|$|Agriculture {{is facing}} {{increasing}} pressures to produce food that meets specific market and/or nutrition requirements, while using inputs {{in such a}} way that can ensure economic and environmental goals more efficiently. Two field experiments were conducted in 2013 and 2014 at the Royal Agricultural University’s Harnhill’ Manor Farm, Cirencester, UK to evaluate the influence of selected cultivation techniques, N fertilisation and undersowing legumes on spring wheat growth and development. To explore, in particular, the yield components contributing to grain yield and quality, as well as weed pressure influences together with changes in soil mineral N (SMN) content. Cultivation techniques included conventional tillage (CT), high intensity non-inversion tillage (HINiT) and low intensity non-inversion tillage (LINiT); <b>mineral</b> N <b>fertilisation</b> rates of 0, 70, 140 and 210 kg N ha- 1 and two undersown legume species, black medic and white clover, plus no undersowing treatment. The performance of the management practices was strongly influenced by the weather. In 2013, under dry weather conditions, LINiT seems to be a suitable alternative to CT, while N fertilisation did not encourage greater grain yield. In 2014, CT appears to be a more reliable practice, while the application of up to 140 kg N ha- 1 seemed to be enough to increase grain yield. Dry weather conditions at the time of broadcasting did not allow the undersowing species to be fully established, resulting in no effects on weed control and crop growth. In 2013, the initial poor plant establishment and slow crop growth under LINiT was compensated for by the soils ability to retain moisture, and thereby reducing crop water stress during the dry periods. This finally resulted in statistically similar grain yield to CT. In 2014 when water was not a limiting factor, poor plant establishment and crop growth, low SMN content and high weed pressure under LINiT resulted in lower grain yield than CT. In both years, HINiT resulted in low SMN content and high weed pressure resulting in poor grain yield. Across experiments, HINiT and LINiT saved energy-use and production costs, but CT could be more energy-use efficient and have high economic return if higher grain yield is assured. N fertilisation significantly promoted wheat growth, although under dry conditions with higher residual soil N, the N fertilisation did not increase yield. Under low SMN level applying up to 140 kg N ha- 1 increased grain yield produced, but N fertilisation is energy consuming and its use does not always ensure a higher economic return...|$|R
40|$|Organic inputs {{can help}} {{maintain}} soil fertility by improving {{chemical and biological}} soil properties. The effects of 40 years of organic, <b>mineral</b> and mixed <b>fertilisations</b> on soil organic properties were evaluated in a continuous maize system. The following properties were analysed: total organic carbon (TOC), humic carbon (HC) and its molecular weight distribution, HC/TOC and the hormone—(auxin and gibberellin-like) activities of the humic substances and their effects on two key enzymes (nitrate reductase (NR) and glutamine synthetase (GS)) involved in nitrate assimilation in maize seedlings. Farmyard manure fertilisation sustained TOC in the top layers while mineral treatments alone or mixed with organic exhibited a minor influence on the organic matter evolution: over 40 years the average TOC depletion was 23 % with liquid manure and mixed fertilisations, 43 % with mineral fertilisers alone and 51 % in the control. The different treatments also influenced the HC molecular complexity. Farmyard fertilisations improved the production of humus {{with a high degree}} of policondensation, a fraction usually linked to soil fertility; the absence of organic fertiliser inputs determined the opposite, with a higher percentage of non-complex and light-weight humus. The hormone-like and biochemical activities of humus substances were evident with the organic and mixed fertilisations. The humus extracted by the soil treated with farmyard manure exhibited the best gibberellin-like activity and the highest increases of NR (+ 42 %) and GS (+ 49 %) activities with respect to the control. The other treatments showed intermediate stimulations as in the case of mixed fertilisations (NR + 22 % and GS + 24 %), or no activities as in the case of mineral inputs...|$|R
