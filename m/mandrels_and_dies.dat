Swaging is a major advance over filing as the operation is faster, more precise and greatly extends the working life of a saw.|$|R

Therefore reliable predictions of the amount of wear and its distribution in dies are important factors for the die manufacturer[1].

5000|$|A spiral die is {{the most}} complex {{of the three major}} blown film die types. The polymer melt is evenly {{distributed}} into several feed tubes, which wind around a central mandrel. Each of these feed tubes is connected to the space between the <b>mandrel</b> <b>and</b> outer <b>die</b> walls; the feed tubes gradually diminish in diameter as they spiral around the mandrel. At the same time, the space between the <b>mandrel</b> <b>and</b> outer <b>die</b> walls is increased. This allows the polymer melt to layer and blend, resulting in a uniform melt profile free of weld lines. This die design produces the most uniform films, but is also the most expensive. Air pressure is introduced through the extrusion die so that after the polymer melt leaves the lip of the die, it expands in circumference. The tubing is also drawn along its length faster than it is being extruded. This leads to thinning of the film as it is expanded in both the draw (or machine) direction, and in the transverse (or hoop) direction. The ratio of the blown diameter to the extruded diameter is known as the blow-up ratio, and affects the resulting physical properties of the film, such as stiffness and strength. Film thickness and blow-up ratio can be varied by altering the take-up rate of the rollers, the internal pressure in the blown tube, and the melt extrusion rate.|$|R
5000|$|Tube forming dies {{allow for}} {{continuous}} extrusion of thick walled (relative to blown film extrusion) tubes and [...] pipes. [...] The dies themselves are {{almost identical to}} those used in blown film extrusion; the only major difference is {{the gap between the}} inner <b>mandrel</b> <b>and</b> outer <b>die</b> wall. Once the polymer melt is extruded from the die, it is pulled away by take-up rollers. Cooling is accomplished through the use of water baths, or a large number of cooling fans. After cooling, the tube is either wound onto large spools (if flexible), or cut into pre-set lengths and stacked (if stiff).|$|R

5000|$|Rotary draw bending (RDB) is {{a precise}} technology, since it bends using tooling or [...] "die sets" [...] {{which have a}} {{constant}} center line radius (CLR), alternatively indicated as Mean Bending Radius (Rm). Rotary draw benders can be programmable to store multiple bend jobs {{with varying degrees of}} bending. Often a positioning index table (IDX) is attached to the bender allowing the operator to reproduce complex bends which can have multiple bends and differing planes.Rotary draw benders are the most popular machines for use in bending tube, pipe and solids for applications like: handrails, frames, motor vehicle roll cages, handles, lines and much more. Rotary draw benders create aesthetically pleasing bends when the right tooling is matched to the application.CNC rotary draw bending machines can be very complex and use sophisticated tooling to produce severe bends with high quality requirements.The complete tooling is required only for high-precision bending of difficult-to-bend tubes with relatively large OD/t (diameter/thickness) ratio and relatively small ratio between the mean bending radius Rm and OD. The use of axial boosting either on the tube free end or on the pressure die is useful to prevent excessive thinning and collapse of the extrados of the tube. The mandrel, with or without ball with spherical links, is mostly used to prevent wrinkles and ovalization. For relatively easy bending processes (that is, as the difficulty factor BF decreases), the tooling can be progressively simplified, eliminating the need for the axial assist, the <b>mandrel,</b> <b>and</b> the wiper <b>die</b> (which mostly prevents wrinkling). Furthermore, in some particular cases, the standard tooling must be modified in order to meet specific requirements of the products.|$|R

5000|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of blind rivets, installation of a solid rivet typically required access to both sides of the assembly: a rivet hammer {{on one side and a}} bucking bar on the other side. In 1916, Royal Navy reservist and engineer Hamilton Neil Wylie filed a patent for an [...] "improved means of closing tubular rivets" [...] (granted May 1917).

40|$|Abstract. Tube bending is {{a complex}} process with multi-factor {{coupling}} effect and multiple defects occurring. The wall thinning, {{as one of the}} important defects in tube bending, determines the bending quality. In this study, taking thin-walled 6061 -T 4 Al-alloy tube with Φ 50. 8 ×t 0. 889 ×R 101. 6 mm (outer diameter D × wall thickness t × bending radius R) as the objective, the significance of processing parameters on the wall thinning degree is studied using the orthogonal test under ABAQUS/Explicit platform. The results show that: 1) the bending radius, the clearance between the tube <b>and</b> the pressure <b>die,</b> the friction between the tube <b>and</b> the pressure <b>die,</b> the clearance between the tube <b>and</b> the pressure <b>die,</b> the clearance between the tube <b>and</b> the <b>mandrel</b> <b>and</b> the friction between the tube <b>and</b> the <b>mandrel</b> affect the wall thinning significantly, while the coefficient of boost velocity, the number of mandrel balls, the friction between the tube <b>and</b> the wiper <b>die,</b> the <b>mandrel</b> extension length <b>and</b> the friction between the tube <b>and</b> the bending <b>die</b> have little effect on the wall thinning degree...|$|R
