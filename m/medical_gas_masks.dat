50|$|The {{personal}} stories {{of how the}} First World War affected the lives of individuals of many nationalities are told through the many objects on display, interactive installations and lifelike characters within the larger picture of the Great War. The displays include <b>medical</b> equipment, <b>gas</b> <b>masks,</b> and a mule and munitions wagon exhibit. Themes {{of the consequences of}} war, how we look into our past, and how and why we remember are explored.|$|R
2500|$|Most civilians {{learned how}} to use <b>gas</b> <b>masks</b> through the civil defense department, but {{children}} received most <b>gas</b> <b>mask</b> education in school drills. Schools would implement <b>gas</b> <b>mask</b> education and training after the outbreak of a war. Schools would harshly enforce the compulsory carrying of <b>gas</b> <b>masks</b> at all times. Gas mask and air raid drills were closely related and children would be made to wear <b>gas</b> <b>masks</b> in everyday activities, including gymnastics. The wearing of <b>gas</b> <b>masks</b> in the classrooms were especially difficult for teachers as they had trouble distinguishing one child from another. The <b>gas</b> <b>masks</b> became as uniform as the students' uniforms. Other civilians learned {{the use of a}} <b>gas</b> <b>mask</b> through posters, pamphlets, and radio lectures, but children learned through cartoons and rhymes such as [...] "coughs and sneezes spread diseases".|$|R
50|$|The <b>gas</b> <b>mask</b> is a mask used {{to protect}} the user from inhaling {{airborne}} pollutants and toxic <b>gases.</b> The <b>mask</b> forms a sealed cover over the nose and mouth, but may also cover the eyes and other vulnerable soft tissues of the face. Some <b>gas</b> <b>masks</b> are also respirators, though the word <b>gas</b> <b>mask</b> {{is often used to}} refer to military equipment (e.g. field protective mask). The user of the <b>gas</b> <b>mask</b> is not protected from gas that the skin can absorb. Most <b>gas</b> <b>mask</b> filters will last around 24 hours in a nuclear biological chemical (NBC) situation.|$|R

50|$|In September 1917, the USAAS {{was joined}} by 150 <b>gas</b> <b>mask</b> instructors. They {{established}} a separate school for training <b>gas</b> <b>mask</b> instructors who would instruct soldiers about using the masks in France.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>gas</b> <b>mask</b> is worn {{over the}} face to protect the wearer from inhaling [...] "airborne pollutants" [...] and toxic <b>gases.</b> The <b>mask</b> forms a sealed cover over the nose and mouth, but may also cover the eyes and other {{vulnerable}} soft tissues of the face. Airborne toxic materials may be gaseous or particulate. Many <b>gas</b> <b>masks</b> include protection from both types. During riots where tear gas or CS-gas is employed by riot police, <b>gas</b> <b>masks</b> are commonly used by police and rioters alike.|$|R
50|$|His Sikh beliefs require him to {{keep his}} facial hair which {{prevents}} the use of regular military <b>gas</b> <b>masks,</b> so Sajjan invented his own <b>gas</b> <b>mask</b> that worked with his beard, and patented it in 1996.|$|R
25|$|The modern <b>gas</b> <b>mask</b> was {{developed}} in 1944 by the US Army Chemical Warfare Service. It was made of plastic and rubber-like material that greatly reduced the weight and bulk, compared to World War I <b>gas</b> <b>masks</b> and fitted the user's face more snugly and comfortably. The main improvement was replacing the separate filter canister connected with a hose by a filter canister screwed {{on the side of}} the <b>gas</b> <b>mask,</b> that could be replaced easily. Also, it had replaceable plastic lenses, much helping vision.|$|R
50|$|The PMK <b>gas</b> <b>mask</b> {{represents}} {{a family of}} <b>gas</b> <b>masks</b> used by the Soviet armed forces, and later by {{the armed forces of}} the Russian Federation. It can be distinguished from its civilian counterpart, the GP-7, by its rounded triangular lenses, versus the GP-7's circular lenses.|$|R

25|$|American chemist and {{inventor}} James Bert Garner {{is credited}} by American sources with {{the invention of}} the <b>gas</b> <b>mask</b> in April 1915. Reading a newspaper article describing a gas attack on British forces which he thought had employed chlorine gas, Garner remembered experiments he had performed while teaching at the University of Chicago, thus he set about creating the first <b>gas</b> <b>mask,</b> which he tested on two of his associates in a gas filled chamber. Following the success of the test, he provided the results to the British government. Also in World War I, since dogs were frequently used on the front lines, a special type of <b>gas</b> <b>mask</b> was developed that dogs were trained to wear. Other <b>gas</b> <b>masks</b> were developed during World War I and the time following for horses in the various mounted units that operated near the front lines. In America thousands of <b>gas</b> <b>masks</b> were produced for American as well as Allied troops. Mine Safety Appliances was a chief producer. This mask was later used widely in industry.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{visually}} spectacular parts of the performance involved a mostly nude female performer wearing a metal plate over her groin and a <b>gas</b> <b>mask</b> over her face. Another member of the troupe, also wearing a <b>gas</b> <b>mask,</b> would use a metal sander against the plate to create a shower of sparks from her groin {{in time to the}} riff of the music. The <b>gas</b> <b>masks</b> protected the performers' eyes from the ingots. This was sometimes done with the female performer upside down, or sometimes with her standing with an additional metal plate on her head.|$|R
