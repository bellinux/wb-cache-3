5|$|By the 1961 Formula One season, the Lotus and Ferrari {{teams had}} {{developed}} the <b>mid-engined</b> approach further than Cooper. Brabham had a poor season, scoring only four points, and—having run {{his own private}} Coopers in non-championship events during 1961—left the company in 1962 to drive for his own team: the Brabham Racing Organisation, using cars built by Motor Racing Developments. The team was based at Chessington, England and held the British nationality.|$|E
5|$|In September 1958 VAT, {{together}} with other Finnish companies, participated in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair. The vehicles shown were one Vanaja VAK lorry and a <b>mid-engined</b> VLK550 bus chassis. Due to the AEC engines the Vanaja's did not raise interest among the potential Greek customers, as relations between the UK and Greece were bad at the time. The lorry was finally sold in Greece but the bus chassis returned to Finland and was sold to a bus operator which built a tourist bus body on it.|$|E
5|$|The Brabham {{team was}} founded by Jack Brabham and Ron Tauranac, who met in 1951 while both were {{successfully}} building and racing cars in their native Australia. Brabham was the more successful driver {{and went to the}} United Kingdom in 1955 to further his racing career. There he started driving for the Cooper Car Company works team and by 1958 had progressed with them to Formula One, the highest category of open-wheel racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motor sport's world governing body. In 1959 and 1960, Brabham won the Formula One World Drivers' Championship in Cooper's revolutionary <b>mid-engined</b> cars.|$|E
5|$|VAT {{delivered}} {{its first}} <b>mid-engined</b> bus chassis to Ajokki Oy coach works in April 1958. It was {{powered by a}} horizontally mounted 164-hp AEC diesel engine. The end customer was bus operator Väinö Paunu Oy, which also participated in the development work. In 1960, VAT introduced the VLK500 chassis with air suspension and dual-circuit air brakes. VAT returned to building rear-engined buses in 1966–67, but sales did not reach {{the level of the}} mid- and front-engined models. The company conducted a number of experiments with the construction; one example was a bus with a frameless structure in which the beams were replaced by a lighter solution.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{earliest}} <b>mid-engined</b> four-wheel-drive cars were the various road-legal rally cars made for Group B homologation, such as the Ford RS200 made from 1984 to 1986. In 1989, niche maker Panther Westwinds created a <b>mid-engined</b> four-wheel-drive, the Panther Solo 2.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{technological}} development, Bugatti's re-introduction of <b>mid-engined</b> cars (following Ferdinand Porsche's pioneering Auto Unions of the 1930s), occurred with the Type 251, which was unsuccessful. Australian Jack Brabham, world champion during , , and , soon proved the <b>mid-engined</b> design's superiority. By , all regular competitors had switched to <b>mid-engined</b> cars. The Ferguson P99, a four-wheel drive design, {{was the last}} front-engined F1 car to enter a world championship race. It was entered in the 1961 British Grand Prix, the only front-engined car to compete that year.|$|E
25|$|The first “modern” <b>mid-engined</b> {{sports car}} design.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mid-engined</b> {{revolution}} rendered another potentially revolutionary car obsolete. The front-engined {{four-wheel drive}} Ferguson P99 raced in British Formula One races in , winning the non-Championship Oulton Park International Gold Cup under heavy rain. But {{the car was}} too heavy and complex compared to {{the new breed of}} <b>mid-engined</b> machines.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>mid-engined</b> {{car with}} central driving {{position}} (albeit Lancia deposited a patent for a central driven design in 1934).|$|E
25|$|The Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4 is a <b>mid-engined</b> sports car, {{designed}} and developed in Germany by the Volkswagen Group and manufactured in Molsheim, France, by Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S., {{named after the}} racing driver Pierre Veyron.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{automatic}} gear box, front <b>mid-engined</b> arrangement, and its driving characteristics, some commentators classify the SLR McLaren as a GT, whose rivals would include vehicles {{such as the}} Aston Martin DBS V12 and Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano.|$|E
25|$|During , Lotus {{introduced}} {{a car with}} an aluminium-sheet monocoque chassis instead of the traditional space-frame design. This {{proved to be the}} greatest technological breakthrough since the introduction of <b>mid-engined</b> cars. During , Lotus painted Imperial Tobacco livery on their cars, thus introducing sponsorship to the sport.|$|E
25|$|Several non-championship races {{known as}} the Donington Grand Prix were held at Donington Park in 1937 and 1938, where the German Mercedes and Auto Unions {{dominated}} the proceedings. Drivers such as German Bernd Rosemeyer and Italian Tazio Nuvolari won this race (both driving <b>mid-engined</b> Auto Union cars).|$|E
25|$|The Metro 6R4 rally car was {{developed}} by Williams in 1984 on commission from Rover. The rally car was a MG Metro with a completely new V6 engine (<b>mid-engined)</b> and four-wheel drive, developed to the international Group B rallying regulations. Williams developed the car in just six months.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s {{were not}} a good period for luxury car {{manufacturers}} and Derek Hurlock went searching for a totally new smaller car. <b>Mid-engined</b> designs were in fashion {{at the time and}} in 1972 the Diablo, a prototype with an Austin Maxi engine and transaxle, was built by privateers Peter Bohanna and Robin Stables.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 Tony Rudd, who {{had arrived}} at Lotus the {{previous}} year, proposed two new model development projects. The first, Project M50, resulted in the 1974 Elite. The second, Project M70, meant to develop a successor to the Europa which, like the Europa, {{was to be a}} two-door fixed-head <b>mid-engined</b> coupé.|$|E
25|$|By late 1972, Volkswagen {{had decided}} to cancel the nearly {{finished}} , a project for a <b>mid-engined</b> car to replace the Beetle, and to focus on front-wheel-drive, water-cooled cars. Rudolf Leiding, recently made head of Volkswagen, cited noise, heat, and servicing problems with the mid-engine layout, {{as well as the}} difficulty of making it a station wagon.|$|E
25|$|The Alpine {{factory in}} Dieppe {{continued}} to expand; in the 1980s they built the special R5 Turbo cars, following the rear engined formula {{they have always}} used. They built all Clio Williams and RenaultSport Spiders. The factory put its Alpine badges on the early batches of the <b>mid-engined</b> Clio series one Clio V6. The Clio Series 2 was also assembled there with more recent RenaultSport Clio 172 and RenaultSport Clio 182s.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, the Lotus team ran the Lotus 25 {{powered by}} the new Coventry-Climax FWMV V8 engine. The car had an {{aluminium}} sheet monocoque chassis instead of the traditional spaceframe design. This {{proved to be the}} greatest technological breakthrough since the introduction of <b>mid-engined</b> cars, but the Lotus was unreliable at first. Jim Clark finished second that year leaving the title to Graham Hill and his new V8 powered BRM.|$|E
25|$|Coventry Climax {{were late}} in {{producing}} the smaller 1.5-litre engine {{required for the}} 1961 season and the Cooper-Climaxes were outclassed by new <b>mid-engined</b> cars from Porsche, Lotus, and championship-winners Ferrari. Brabham scored only three points and finished 11th in the championship. He had a little more success in the non-championship Formula One races, where he ran his own private Coopers and took three victories at Snetterton (26 March), Brussels (9 April), and Aintree (22 April).|$|E
25|$|In October 1999, Bugatti {{unveiled}} a fourth concept {{car at the}} Tokyo Motor Show. The EB 18/4 Veyron was a <b>mid-engined</b> supercar styled in-house {{under the direction of}} Hartmut Warkuß. In 2000 a modified version, the EB 16/4 Veyron, was displayed at motor shows in Detroit, Geneva, and Paris. Rather than the three-bank W-18 of the four previous concepts, the EB 16/4 featured the four-bank W16 engine architecture installed in every production example of the Bugatti Veyron.|$|E
25|$|Next {{came the}} 1984 Fiero. This {{was a major}} {{departure}} from anything Pontiac had produced in the past. A two-seat, <b>mid-engined</b> coupe, the Fiero was targeted straight at the same market that Semon Knudsen had been aiming for in the late 1950s: the young, affluent buyer who wanted sporting performance at a reasonable price. The Fiero was also an instant success and was partially responsible for Pontiac seeing its first increase in sales in four years.|$|E
25|$|The Pontiac Fiero is a <b>mid-engined</b> {{sports car}} built by Pontiac from 1983 to 1988. The Fiero was {{designed}} by George Milidrag and Hulki Aldikacti as a sports car. The Fiero was the first two-seater Pontiac since the 1926 to 1938 coupes, and also {{the first and only}} mass-produced mid-engine sports car by a U.S. manufacturer. Many technologies incorporated in the Fiero design such as plastic body panels were radical for their time. Other features included hidden headlamps and, initially, integrated stereo speakers within the driver and passenger headrests.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{taking the}} title with Schnitzer, Ertl {{switched}} to Zakspeed {{for the next}} two seasons. 1979 started off promising with a win in the opening round at Zolder, then followed it up with a third in Hockenheim in the next race. Although he would win once more at Mainz-Finthen, the season turned miserable with six non-finishes or non-starts out of 11 races, in Zakspeed’s Ford Capri Turbo. Meanwhile, Zakspeed also developed a <b>mid-engined</b> Lotus Europa for the 1000km Nürburgring. That also did not finish the race. The following season was like the previous one, when Ertl continued to be unlucky: 8 poles, 4 wins and 6 retirements.|$|E
25|$|Rover took a {{controlling}} interest in Alvis in 1965 and a Rover-designed <b>mid-engined</b> V8 coupé prototype named the P6BS was rumoured {{to be the}} new Alvis model but with the takeover by British Leyland this too was shelved. By the time the TF 21 was launched in 1966, (available, like its predecessors in both saloon and drophead form and with either manual or automatic gearbox), the model was beginning to show its age despite a top speed of 127mph – the fastest Alvis ever produced. With only 109 sold and with political troubles aplenty in the UK car manufacturing business at that time, production finally ceased in 1967.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1970s, while Lamborghini {{was under}} the {{management}} of Georges-Henri Rossetti, Lamborghini entered into an agreement with BMW to develop, then manufacture 400 cars for BMW {{in order to meet}} Group 4 homologation requirements. BMW lacked experience developing a <b>mid-engined</b> vehicle and believed that Lamborghini's experience in that area would make Lamborghini an ideal choice of partner. Due to Lamborghini's shaky finances, Lamborghini fell behind schedule developing the car's structure and running gear. When Lamborghini failed to deliver working prototypes on time, BMW took the program in house, finishing development without Lamborghini. BMW contracted with Baur to produce the car, which BMW named the M1, delivering the first vehicle in October 1978.|$|E
25|$|In fact, it was {{not until}} the Indianapolis 500 was removed from the Formula One {{calendar}} that European entries made their return. In 1963, technical innovator Colin Chapman brought his Team Lotus to Indianapolis for the first time, attracted by the large monetary prizes, far bigger than the usual at a European event. Racing a <b>mid-engined</b> car, Scotsman Jim Clark was second in his first attempt in 1963, dominating in 1964 until suffering suspension failure on lap 47, and completely dominating the race in 1965, a victory which also interrupted the success of the Offy, and giving the 4.2 litre Ford V8 its first success at the race. The following year, 1966, saw another British win, this time Graham Hill in a Lola-Ford.|$|E
25|$|The Soviets {{developed}} successful group aerial fighting tactics for the Bell {{fighters and}} scored {{a surprising number}} of aerial victories over a variety of German aircraft. Low ceilings, short missions, good radios, a sealed and warm cockpit and ruggedness contributed to their effectiveness. To pilots who had once flown the tricky Polikarpov I-16, the aerodynamic quirks of the <b>mid-engined</b> aircraft were unimportant. In the Far East, P-63 and P-39 aircraft were used in the Soviet invasion of Manchukuo and northern Korea. In the Pacific theatre, the Kingcobras flew escort, close air support and ground attack missions. The Soviet P-63s achieved their first air victory on 15 August 1945, when Lejtenant I. F. Miroshnichenko from 17th IAP/190 IAD, shot down a Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa IJAAS fighter off the coast of North Korea.|$|E
25|$|The even-{{numbered}} {{years were}} at Silverstone {{and the odd}} numbered and 1962 were at Aintree. 1956 saw Fangio win in a Ferrari, and 1957 returned to see Moss win again in a Vanwall; he took over his ill teammate Tony Brooks's car and stormed through the field to take victory. This was the first Grand Prix victory for a British-built car- Formula One would soon be mostly made up of British teams. 1958 was when Peter Collins won in a Ferrari and Bernie Ecclestone was entered in a Connaught but his car was driven by Jack Fairman; and 1959 and 1960 saw Australian Jack Brabham win in a <b>mid-engined</b> Cooper. The last race at Aintree was in 1962, when Briton Jim Clark won his first of 5 British Grands Prix; Aintree was later decommissioned in 1964.|$|E
25|$|Brabham was a Royal Australian Air Force flight {{mechanic}} {{and ran a}} small engineering workshop before he started racing midget cars in 1948. His successes with midgets in Australian and New Zealand road racing events led to his going to Britain to further his racing career. There he {{became part of the}} Cooper Car Company's racing team, building as well as racing cars. He contributed to the design of the <b>mid-engined</b> cars that Cooper introduced to Formula One and the Indianapolis 500, and won the Formula One world championship in 1959 and 1960. In 1962 he established his own Brabham marque with fellow Australian Ron Tauranac, which in the 1960s became the largest manufacturer of customer racing cars in the world. In the 1966 Formula One season Brabham became the first – and still the only – man to win the Formula One world championship driving one of his own cars. He was the last surviving World Champion of the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|As Honda {{entered into}} {{automobile}} manufacturing {{in the late}} 1960s, where Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota and Nissan had been making cars since before WWII, it appears that Honda instilled a sense of doing things a little differently than its Japanese competitors. Its mainstay products, like the Accord and Civic (with the exception of its USA-market 1993–97 Passport {{which was part of}} a vehicle exchange program with Isuzu (part of the Subaru-Isuzu joint venture)), have always employed front-wheel-drive powertrain implementation, which is currently a long held Honda tradition. Honda also installed new technologies into their products, first as optional equipment, then later standard, like anti lock brakes, speed sensitive power steering, and multi-port fuel injection in the early 1980s. This desire {{to be the first to}} try new approaches is evident with the creation of the first Japanese luxury chain Acura, and was also evident with the all aluminum, <b>mid-engined</b> sports car, the Honda NSX, which also introduced variable valve timing technology, Honda calls VTEC.|$|E
25|$|The Murciélago is an all-wheel drive, <b>mid-engined</b> supersports car. With an angular {{design and}} an {{exceptionally}} low slung body, {{the highest point}} of the roof is just under 4 feet above the ground. One of the vehicle's most distinguishing features are its scissor doors. which lends to the extreme image. First-generation Murciélagos, produced between 2001 and 2006, were powered by a Lamborghini V12 that traces its roots back to the company's beginnings in the 1960s. The rear differential is integrated with the engine itself, with a viscous coupling center differential providing drive to the front wheels. Power is delivered through a 6-speed manual transmission. The Murciélago suspension uses an independent double-wishbone design, and bodywork features carbon fiber, steel and aluminum parts. The rear spoiler and the active air intakes integrated into the car's shoulders are electromechanically controlled, deploying automatically only at high speeds {{in an effort to}} maximize both aerodynamic and cooling efficiency.|$|E
25|$|In , in {{an attempt}} to curb speeds, Formula One was {{downgraded}} to 1.5-litre, non-supercharged engines (essentially the then-current Formula Two rules), a formula which would remain for the next five years. Forced induction was still an option, but limited to 750cc and no one seriously considered the option, as supercharging had proven limiting to fuel consumption. Ferrari could have used its already proven V6 powered <b>mid-engined</b> Formula 2 cars, but preferred to go one step forward by designing a very sophisticated car powered by a 120° V6, which was their first ever rear-mid engined car, the 156. The considerably more powerful and efficient engine Ferrari had led to the Maranello outfit dominating the 1961 season as the British teams scrambled {{to come up with a}} suitable engine. American Phil Hill won the 1961 title in a works Ferrari. His teammate, Wolfgang von Trips of Germany, died along with 14 spectators in a horrific crash on the first lap of the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Vincent Tesoriero, a race {{promoter}} {{and former}} Bathurst 1000 competitor, {{looked at the}} decline of Group A touring cars in Australia and saw an opportunity to run a 12-hour endurance race for Series Production cars at Mount Panorama. Tesoriero secured long time Bathurst 1000 sponsor James Hardie as a sponsor for the event in late 1990, leaving limited time to launch and organise the event for the Easter weekend in 1991. The race regulations {{were based on the}} Group 3E Series Production Car rules then in use in the Australian Production Car Championship for naturally aspirated four- and six-cylinder passenger sedans, but also allowed turbocharged and V8-engined cars which had been outlawed from the Production Car Championship in 1990. Despite the short deadline, twenty-four cars were entered for the first race, spread over six different classes based on engine capacity and sporting specification. Exotic <b>mid-engined</b> sports cars and GT cars were not eligible to enter.|$|E
25|$|Fred Dixon and Tony Rolt {{considered}} {{the possibility of using}} 4WD in circuit racing, and with Harry Ferguson keen to promote the transmission systems of his Ferguson tractor firm work began on the P99 in 1960. With a 50–50 torque distribution front to rear the car, Claude Hill's design was built to have an even weight distribution over both axles, which along with the position of the gearbox necessitated a front-engined design despite Cooper's and Lotus's overwhelming recent success with <b>mid-engined</b> cars. Just as the project was nearing completion it was dealt something of a body blow by the governing body's decision {{to reduce the size of}} F1 engines by 40% for , making the extra weight of the 4WD transmission a much bigger penalty. Nevertheless the team persevered and fitted a standard 1.5-litre Climax 4-cylinder engine, mounted at a slant to make room for the front driveshaft. In addition the driving position was moved slightly off-centre to accommodate the gearbox and rear driveshaft to the driver's left hand side.|$|E
500|$|The bus model {{numbering}} {{changed for}} the last time in 1966; the front-engined VLB became LE6, the <b>mid-engined</b> VLK was changed to LK6 and the rear-engined VLT became LT6. The three-digit numbers on the bonnet sides of the last Vanaja lorries [...] indicate the engine displacement in cubic inches. They are not model numbers, although they are often incorrectly referred to as such.|$|E
