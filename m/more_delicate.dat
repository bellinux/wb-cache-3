5|$|Between 2007 and 2012 {{an average}} of 30,000 {{visitors}} came to the tower each year, with non-English speaking visitors making up a high proportion. The architecture of the tower has made it a challenging site to operate as a tourist attraction; the fluctuating heat and humidity, and capacity constraints, have prevented it being adapted to house <b>more</b> <b>delicate</b> historical artefacts or accommodate additional visitor numbers.|$|E
5|$|Mantises can be loosely {{categorized}} as being macropterous (long-winged), brachypterous (short-winged), micropterous (vestigial-winged), or apterous (wingless). If not wingless, a mantis has {{two sets of}} wings: the outer wings, or tegmina, are usually narrow and leathery. They function as camouflage and as a shield for the hind wings, which are clearer and <b>more</b> <b>delicate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Monotype created several titling designs {{based on}} Renaissance {{printing}} {{that could be}} considered complementary to Bembo: Bembo Titling (based directly on Bembo's capitals, but <b>more</b> <b>delicate</b> to suit a larger text size) and the more geometric Felix Titling in 1934, inspired by humanist capitals drawn by Felice Feliciano in 1463. In the hot metal type era Monotype also issued a titling version of Centaur, which was often used by Penguin; Monotype's digitisations of Centaur do not include it.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the regularity, exponential stability of solutions and existence of universal attractor in H 4 for a nonlinear one-dimensional compressible Navier–Stokes equations describing a motion of heat-conductive viscous real gas in a bounded domain Ω=(0, 1). Some new ideas and <b>more</b> <b>delicated</b> estimates are introduced to prove these results...|$|R

5000|$|... “Oberlängen”: Double-height capitals {{and letters}} with ascenders, making the lower-case look even <b>more</b> small and <b>delicate</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Riesling {{was first}} planted in New Zealand in the 1970s and has {{flourished in the}} {{relatively}} cool climate of the Marlborough area and for late harvests in the Nelson region. In comparison to Australian Riesling, New Zealand produces lighter and <b>more</b> <b>delicate</b> wines that range from sweet to dry. Home of cool climate wines, Central Otago, has recently emerged as another area producing terroir driven wines.|$|E
5|$|The cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum, {{and spinal}} cord {{are covered by}} three {{membranes}} called meninges. The membranes are the tough dura mater; the middle arachnoid mater and the <b>more</b> <b>delicate</b> inner pia mater. Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space, which contains the cerebrospinal fluid. In the cerebral cortex, close to the basement membrane of the pia mater, is a limiting membrane called the glia limitans; this is the outermost membrane of the cortex.|$|E
5|$|Well-known {{and easily}} recognisable, the Australian magpie is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species. The pied butcherbird has a similar build and plumage, but has white underparts unlike the former species' black underparts. The magpie-lark is a much smaller and <b>more</b> <b>delicate</b> bird with complex and very different banded black and white plumage. Currawong species have predominantly dark plumage and heavier bills.|$|E
5000|$|Puerto Fino, made around El Puerto de Santa María. The cooler climate {{near the}} sea {{results in a}} thicker layer of flor and a <b>more</b> acidic and <b>delicate</b> flavour than Jerez Fino.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} {{frequently}} {{confused with the}} related species Aloe ferox, Aloe africana and Aloe excelsa. However it has <b>more</b> thin <b>delicate</b> leaves and trunk than these robust arborescent aloe species. In its multi-branched form, it can also look similar to the smaller multi-branched Aloe arborescens. The French Aloe's flowers are different from all of these other species though, and the spiral leaf-growth is also distinctive.|$|R
60|$|Alida {{could not}} object to this liberality, though she was not without a secret opinion that the gifts were no <b>more</b> than <b>delicate</b> and well-concealed offerings to herself. The effect of this {{suspicion}} was two-fold; it caused the maiden to become more reserved in the expression of her tastes, though it in no degree lessened her confidence in, and admiration of, the wayward and remarkable trader.|$|R
5|$|As {{his works}} have sold since the 2010s, Invader adopted a new {{strategy}} to avoid them being removed. In late 2015, Invader planned a series of art pieces in New York City, putting out a call on social media for building owners who {{would be willing to}} host his mosaics legally. In addition, he has chosen sites with architectural features restricting access. Also, his works may be larger and use <b>more</b> <b>delicate</b> tiles so that they cannot be removed undamaged.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{a liberal}} agitation, pro-Greek and {{inspired}} {{by what was}} then happening in that country, began to develop in France. The longer France waited, the <b>more</b> <b>delicate</b> her position vis-à-vis Metternich became. The ultra-royalist government thus decided to accelerate events. A land expedition was proposed to Great Britain, which refused to intervene directly. Meanwhile, Russia had declared war against the Ottoman Empire and its military victories were unsettling for London, which {{did not wish to}} see the Tsarist empire extend too far south. Thus Great Britain did not oppose an intervention by France alone.|$|E
5|$|French typefounders of the 16th century assiduously {{examined}} Manutius's work (and, it is thought, De Aetna in particular) as {{a source}} of inspiration. This examination extended to in some cases copying his first 'M' shown in De Aetna which had no serif pointing out of the letter at top right, a design considered very eccentric. (It has been suggested {{to be the result of}} defective casting, especially since Manutius' later fonts do not show it.) The Griffo font was only cut in a single size, so French punchcutters made modified versions of the design to suit different sizes, with a <b>more</b> <b>delicate</b> structure at larger sizes.|$|E
50|$|Nearly 400 wounded {{were treated}} in the first days, the most seriously wounded {{evacuated}} by sea to England. The two surgery teams, poorly equipped as they were, also performed <b>more</b> than 43 <b>delicate</b> operations.|$|R
60|$|Albert, who well {{knew that}} the King's mode of thinking, where the fair sex was concerned, was far <b>more</b> gay than <b>delicate,</b> endeavoured {{to put a stop}} to the present topic by a grave answer.|$|R
50|$|Dichroic {{filters are}} {{particularly}} suited for precise scientific work, since their exact colour range {{can be controlled}} by the thickness and sequence of the coatings. They are usually much <b>more</b> expensive and <b>delicate</b> than absorption filters.|$|R
5|$|The blacknose shark {{has never}} been implicated in an attack on humans. However, caution should be {{exercised}} if it begins to perform a threat display. This species {{is regarded as a}} game fish and offers a respectable fight on light tackle (a <b>more</b> <b>delicate</b> fishing line). It is also of regional commercial importance, being taken intentionally and as bycatch via gillnets and surface longlines across its range, most significantly off southwestern Florida, Venezuela, and Brazil; the meat is sold dried and salted. Large numbers of blacknose sharks are also caught incidentally by shrimp trawlers, which may pose a greater threat to its population, as many of the sharks taken are immature.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{were often}} first sketched by Oliver, before {{she moved to}} {{construction}} in three dimensions. When preparing commissions, she would draw on the ideas of clients or {{the nature of the}} site. For large works she created maquettes (or models), sometimes in plasticine, on other occasions using copper wire or, in the case of her 2002 sculpture Globe, wood and metal. Oliver would produce the <b>more</b> <b>delicate</b> works herself. Many were created by crafting and joining wire to create abstract forms. These were built around moulds, twisting the metal into place with pliers, before severing it with wirecutters. Joins were soldered or brazed (though in some pieces, the wire was woven). In Web (2002), copper pieces were sewn together using wire.|$|E
5|$|The {{subspecies}} Oryzomys couesi pinicola {{was described}} in 1932 from a pine ridge in western British Honduras (now Belize); it is smaller and darker than nominate couesi, which also occurs in Belize, and has a <b>more</b> <b>delicate</b> skull. In 1901, Merriam described the Oryzomys of the island of Cozumel as a separate species, Oryzomys cozumelae, and Goldman kept it as such because of its large size, dark fur, and long tail. In 1965, however, Knox Jones and Timothy Lawlor judged the differences between cozumelae and mainland couesi trivial and found that cozumelae was inside the range of variation of mainland Oryzomys populations; accordingly, they demoted the island form to a subspecies. Mark Engstrom and colleagues, writing in 1989, reaffirmed this conclusion. For an island form, this population is highly genetically variable. In its Cytb sequence data, it falls among populations of nominate couesi. Oryzomys couesi is also found on Turneffe Atoll {{off the coast of}} Belize and Roatán off Honduras.|$|E
60|$|For {{compassion}} a {{human heart}} suffices; but for full and adequate sympathy with joy an angel's only. And ever remember, that the <b>more</b> exquisite and <b>delicate</b> a flower of joy, the tenderer {{must be the}} hand that plucks it.|$|R
50|$|Display typefaces {{intended}} to be used at large sizes, such as on signs and posters, vary in x-height. Many have high x-heights to be read clearly from a distance. This, though, is not universally the case: some display typefaces such as Cochin intended for publicity uses have low x-heights, {{to give them a}} <b>more</b> elegant, <b>delicate</b> appearance. Many sans-serif designs that are intended for display text have high x-heights, such as Helvetica or, more extremely, Impact.|$|R
30|$|The size of {{the bottle}} shows the {{expected}} inverse and strong relation with price, with larger bottles that are paid less than smaller ones. We also showed that, in this market segment, olive oils with intense flavorings worth significantly <b>more</b> than <b>delicate</b> oils. This is coherent with a demand for high-quality EVOOs {{to be used as}} a raw condiment rather than for cooking, as for such uses an intense flavor is usually more appreciated than a more neutral taste.|$|R
5|$|While Bembo Book is {{considered}} the superior digitisation, the original continues to offer the advantages of two extra weights (semi- and extra-bold) and infant styles with simplified a and g characters resembling handwriting; its lighter appearance may also be of use on printing equipment with greater ink spread. Cross-licensing has meant that it is sold by a range of vendors, often at very low prices. As an example of this, Fontsite obtained the rights to resell a derivative of the original digitisation, using the alternative name Borgia and Bergamo, upgrading it by additional OpenType features such as small capitals and historical alternative characters. Neither version includes digitisations of the larger size versions of Bembo, which had a <b>more</b> <b>delicate</b> and elegant design.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} half of the century several castles were maintained, or brought back into {{military}} use. During the Irish War of Independence Dublin Castle remained the centre of the British administration, military and intelligence operations in Ireland until the transfer of power and the castle to the Irish Free State in 1922. During the Second World War the Tower of London was used to hold and execute suspected spies, and was used to briefly detain Rudolf Hess, Adolf Hitler's deputy, in 1941. Edinburgh Castle was used as a prisoner of war facility, while Windsor Castle was stripped of <b>more</b> <b>delicate</b> royal treasures and used to guard the British royal family from the dangers of the Blitz. Some coastal castles were used to support naval operations: Dover Castle's medieval fortifications used as basis for defences across the Dover Strait; Pitreavie Castle in Scotland was used to support the Royal Navy; and Carrickfergus Castle in Ireland was used as a coastal defence base. Some castles, such as Cambridge and Pevensey, were brought into local defence plans in case of a German invasion. A handful of these castles retained a military role after the war; Dover was used as a nuclear war command centre into the 1950s, while Pitreavie was used by NATO until the turn of the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|The same {{techniques}} {{are used to}} paint {{the various types of}} porcelain and earthenware, both underglaze and overglaze, but different pigments are used due to the different body characteristics and firing temperatures. Generally earthenware painting uses bolder, simpler designs, while china painting may be finer and <b>more</b> <b>delicate.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, {{there are}} men who are born good just as others are born witty. What I mean is his nature. No simpler, <b>more</b> {{scrupulously}} <b>delicate</b> soul had ever lived in such a—a—comfortable envelope. How we used to laugh at Davidson’s fine scruples! In short, he’s thoroughly humane, and I don’t imagine there can be much of any other sort of goodness that counts on this earth. And as he’s that with a shade of particular refinement, I may well call him a ‘really good man.’” ...|$|R
5000|$|Bassist Brian Cook {{said that}} Memorial is more [...] "polarizing" [...] between heavy and soft parts than {{previous}} efforts, {{and that the}} [...] "heavy parts are much more blown out and exaggerated while the pretty moments are far <b>more</b> restrained, <b>delicate,</b> and atmospheric." [...] Cook also described the album as being darker and more somber than previous efforts. Inspired by Pink Floyds 1977 album Animals, Memorials album structure features the similarly composed intro/outro songs [...] "Memoriam" [...] and [...] "Memorial" [...] to make the album start and end in the same place.|$|R
5000|$|Originally called Leichte Stücke (Easy Pieces), {{the section}} titles were only added after the {{completion}} of the composition, and Schumann described them as [...] "nothing <b>more</b> than <b>delicate</b> hints for execution and interpretation". Timothy D. Taylor, however, has discussed the choice of titles for this work {{in the context of the}} changing situation of music culturally and economically, stating that the final movement, entitled Der Dichter spricht (The Poet Speaks), marked a realisation among composers that, due to the decline of patronage structures in the 19th century, their musical works must take on new meanings.|$|R
25|$|Duck {{foie gras}} is the {{slightly}} cheaper and, since {{a change of}} production methods in the 1950s to battery, {{by far the most}} common kind, particularly in the US. The taste of duck foie gras {{is often referred to as}} musky with a subtle bitterness. Goose foie gras is noted for being less gamey and smoother, with a <b>more</b> <b>delicate</b> flavor.|$|E
25|$|Savigny is {{the third}} biggest {{appellation}} by production in the Côte de Beaune, with around 100,000 cases of mostly red wine. The 22 Premier Crus come in two styles, <b>more</b> <b>delicate</b> on the south facing clay soils to the north, rounder and more forward on the east facing gravel to the south. The vineyards cover 544 ha of which 141.5 ha is Premier Cru.|$|E
25|$|Plains-dwelling {{tinamous}} have higher-pitched, <b>more</b> <b>delicate</b> voices. They {{can also}} be less melodic, sometimes resembling the chirps of crickets. Forest species tend to have deep, loud calls, suitable for penetrating the vegetation. The male highland tinamou can be heard several kilometres distant through dense forest. When calling, a tinamou extends its neck vertically, tilts its head at an angle, and opens its bill wide. A bird, when flushed, will utter a sharp trill.|$|E
60|$|As {{time passed}} on, Jane became <b>more</b> weakly and <b>delicate</b> while Barbara grew up very handsome, {{and full of}} life and spirit, but fonder of her sister than ever, and always coming home from her parties and gaieties, as if telling Jane about them was {{the best part of}} all.|$|R
5000|$|... {{denotes the}} rising {{factorial}} {{power in the}} notation of D. E. Knuth and the number Bn are the Bernoulli number. The series is one of alternating terms and the function quickly tends to minus infinity for increasingly negative values of x. Positive values of x are <b>more</b> interesting and <b>delicate.</b>|$|R
50|$|Torii Kiyonobu II and Kiyomasu II, {{the second}} {{generation}} of the school, saw it to its climax. Both artists were active from the 1720s to the 1760s, and consolidated the bolder style of Kiyonobu with the <b>more</b> graceful, <b>delicate</b> style of Kiyomasu. They helped develop the Torii style away from the early, primitive forms of Moronobu and into something that formed {{a key part of}} the mainstream style of ukiyo-e. They also, however, experimented with the use of urushi-e, using lacquer for deeper, bolder lines, and brass or other metal dust to add a sparkle to their works.|$|R
