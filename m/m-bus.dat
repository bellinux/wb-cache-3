50|$|<b>M-Bus</b> (Meter-Bus) is a European {{standard}} (EN 13757-2 {{physical and}} link layer, EN 13757-3 application layer) for the remote reading of gas or electricity meters. <b>M-Bus</b> is also usable for {{other types of}} consumption meters. The <b>M-Bus</b> interface is made for communication on two wires, making it very cost effective. A radio variant of <b>M-Bus</b> (Wireless <b>M-Bus)</b> is also specified in EN 13757-4.|$|E
50|$|Other {{applications}} for the <b>M-Bus</b> such as alarm systems, flexible illumination installations, heating control, etc. are suitable.|$|E
50|$|Since the <b>M-Bus</b> {{is not a}} network, and {{therefore}} does not - among other things - need a transport or session layer, the levels four to six of the OSI model are empty. Therefore, only the physical, the data link, the network and the application layer are provided with functions.|$|E
50|$|Since no {{bus system}} was {{available}} for the requirements of meter reading, the <b>M-Bus</b> was developed by Professor Dr. Horst Ziegler of the University of Paderborn in cooperation with Texas Instruments Deutschland GmbH and Techem GmbH.

50|$|The <b>M-Bus</b> was {{developed}} to fill {{the need for a}} system for the networking and remote reading of utility meters, for example to measure the consumption of gas or water in the home. This bus fulfills the special requirements of remotely powered or battery-driven systems, including consumer utility meters. When interrogated, the meters deliver the data they have collected to a common master, such as a hand-held computer, connected at periodic intervals to read all utility meters of a building. An alternative method of collecting data centrally is to transmit meter readings via a modem.|$|E
50|$|The 8061 had an interruptible-burst-mode 11-wire 8-bit memory {{interface}} bus {{called the}} <b>M-Bus.</b> This bus required a program counter and a data address register in each memory device.

The instruction stream could be interrupted to read or write data bytes and words using the memory's data address register while retaining the memory's program counter copy - allowing resumption of reading the instruction stream without having to re-send a program address after each data access.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{discusses the}} concept of drivers implemented {{within the context of}} the REMPLI (Real-Time Energy Management over Power line and Internet, see section 1. 8.) network. The process image approach and the tunnelling approach are presented and reasoning is given why the tunnelling approach is preferred. Each of the drivers implemented is associated with a specific metering protocol. This document further discusses the general architecture of such a driver structure. The generic software architecture serves as a framework for integrating serial communication based metering protocols over packet-orientated remote networks and meters, by tunnelling the protocol data units to the remote meters. Principally each Protocol Driver consists of three parts, one part situated at the Application Server, one at the Access Point and one at the Node. This document then gives a description of the general driver structure within the REMPLI network and briefly explains the functions of all the modules contained within the driver structure. An example is used to show how these modules, which make up the software architecture of the Protocol Driver, are used to send an application generated request from the Application Server to the Metering Equipment and sending the response back from the remote Metering Equipment to the Application Server. This dissertation further discusses the need for address translation within the REMPLI network and the need to restrict access to meters by using these addresses and an access control list. This document also discusses the need for a “Keep-alive” signalling scheme, if supported by the underlying protocol and gives a general concept as to how it should be implemented. The role of an Optimization Module is also discussed for low bandwidth networks by means of an <b>M-Bus</b> example. Finally the <b>M-Bus</b> protocol driver implementation is discussed. The results achieved are presented, showing that the driver architecture can successfully be used to tunnel the <b>M-Bus</b> protocol to remote meters, provided the underlying network conforms to the quality of service requirements determined by the implemented metering protocol. The work proposed in this document started off as part of the REMPLI project by the REMPLI team but was completed independently.
