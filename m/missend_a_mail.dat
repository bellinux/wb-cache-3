50|$|LMTP is {{designed}} {{as an alternative}} to normal SMTP for situations where the receiving side does not have <b>a</b> <b>mail</b> queue, such as <b>a</b> <b>mail</b> storage server acting as <b>a</b> <b>Mail</b> Delivery Agent (MDA). <b>Mail</b> queues are <b>an</b> inherent requisite of SMTP. In situations in which mail queues are not possible, LMTP is desirable, since <b>a</b> <b>mail</b> storage server should manage only its mail store without having to allocate more storage for <b>a</b> <b>mail</b> queue. This is not possible with SMTP when there are multiple recipients for <b>a</b> <b>mail</b> message. SMTP can only indicate successful delivery or failure for all or none of the recipients, creating the need for a separate queue to handle the failed recipients. LMTP, on the other hand, can indicate success or failure to the client for each recipient, allowing the client to handle the queueing instead. The client in this case would typically be <b>an</b> Internet-facing <b>mail</b> gateway. LMTP is not intended for use over wide area networks. In other words, the Message transfer agent (MTA) still handles all outgoing mail, including the mail stream from the LMTP, to another mail server located somewhere on the Internet.|$|R
