He released two more EPs—Kaleidoscope Dream: Water Preview on July 31 and Air Preview on September 11— to digital retailers. In an interview for The Village Voice, Miguel said that the strategy allowed listeners to absorb the songs at his desired pace and called it [...] "a great {{way for me to}} reconnect with <b>my</b> <b>peers</b> ... the people that I hang out with—that go to the same shows, listen to the same music, read the same blogs, same magazines." ...|$|E

It was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler, {{the director of the}} previous single's video, [...] "Unfaithful". In an interview with Corey Moss of MTV, Rihanna explained the concept behind the inspiration for the video, saying, [...] "We just wanted to reconnect with <b>my</b> <b>peers,</b> let them know I'm still a teen, I still have friends– but to make something provocative. The '' and 'Unfaithful' [...] were so out there, so we pulled it back a little bit. I'm chilling with my girls some." [...] The singer continued to talk about the choreographic content, saying, [...] "I'm dancing , like technical dance, which was a challenge... It usually takes years to learn, but we got it done in a few days. And it was beautifully shot." [...] The video was released to download via iTunes on September 18, 2006 in Ireland and September 20, 2006 in the United States.|$|E

[...] She faced {{criticism}} {{from her parents}} over her decision to marry and start a large family so young. [...] She also felt snubbed by her peers, {{at a time when}} the feminist movement was blooming and educated women were establishing careers. [...] She later said, [...] "My parents were questioning my choices, <b>my</b> <b>peers</b> were. But [...] I was pretty resolute, pretty confident in what I was doing." [...] She taught early morning seminary to them and other children while her husband worked, first in business, then in politics. [...] She wanted to go on for a master's degree, perhaps in art history, but first taking care of her children, and later her health issues, forestalled that. [...] She was active in the local PTA and with the League of Women Voters. [...] With a friend, she held local cooking classes for a brief period. [...] Naturally athletic, she began playing tennis and became one of the best players around the local country clubs.|$|E

She told Marie Claire: [...] "I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of <b>my</b> <b>peers</b> is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think you become more relatable when you're vulnerable." [...] Kristen Wiig commented that [...] "as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record." [...] According to Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, [...] "being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet." [...] The New York Times labeled her [...] "the most potent pop star of the day – her hits are relatable with just a hint of experimentation". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent [...] "clichés". Throughout her career, Perry has co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Selena Gomez & the Scene, Jessie James, Kelly Clarkson, Lesley Roy, Britney Spears, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj.|$|E

40|$|My {{research}} {{provides an}} account of evaluating my mentoring practice using an Action Research design complemented by a mixed methods approach and the Hermann Whole Brain® Model (Herrmann, 1995). I explored how I can transform my mentoring practice using the principles of Whole Brain® thinking and how I can contribute to enriching the professional development of academic staff. My research has proceeded from an innovative idea and existing practice as an asset-based approach (Du Toit, 2009). By utilising an Action Research design my research articulates the construction of my understanding of mentoring of other academic staff in their professional practice. I followed a constructivist approach as used by Piaget (1952, 1970) that is considered an appropriate epistemological underpinning of Action Research. My research design shows thinking style flexibility as an action researcher in that I have drawn on each quadrant of the Whole Brain® Theory as developed by Herrmann (1995). This enabled me to construct meaning with <b>my</b> <b>peer</b> mentees through the assessing of practice-based evidence, engagement and reflection. As my goal in mentoring is to assist in developing independent reflexive practitioners, I have chosen to use the constructs contribute to and catalyse to express my awareness that responsibility for professional development remains with the individual and that a mentor {{is not the only}} source of professional development {{in the context of a}} Private Higher Education Institution. I have found that <b>my</b> <b>peer</b> mentees have differing thinking style preferences and varying professional experiences that required of me to engage with each in distinct ways to support the development of their professional practices. I position Whole Brain® Mentoring as a practice of mentoring that utilises multiple strategies for professional learning, both formal and non-formal, to engage the thinking preferences and disinclinations of mentees to catalyse the professional development of both the mentor and mentees. Many of <b>my</b> <b>peer</b> mentees perceive themselves as mentors, both of students and, in some cases, of other academic staff (our peers) as well. There is evidence that I utilise multiple strategies to facilitate professional learning and contribute to the professional development of peer mentees and that they have contributed to mine. My research provides evidence that I have become a more reflective practitioner, able to transform my Whole Brain® Mentoring Practice.

Not since 1967 had any player finished the regular season first in average, home runs, and runs batted in. Thomas had recorded 32 home runs at the All-Star break, and was contending for the honor when the strike occurred. Pressed by the media to comment on his accomplishments—and his future—Thomas downplayed his own significance, telling the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: [...] "I'm not into being known as the best by fans or the media. I care how I'm perceived by <b>my</b> <b>peers.</b> I can settle for the label 'one of the best' because that means you're considered an elite player." ...|$|E
