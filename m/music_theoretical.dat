50|$|Any {{discussion}} of ancient Greek <b>music,</b> <b>theoretical,</b> philosophical or aesthetic, {{is fraught with}} two problems: there are few examples of written music, and there are many, sometimes fragmentary, theoretical and philosophical accounts. This article provides an overview that includes examples {{of different kinds of}} classification while also trying to show the broader form evolving from the simple tetrachord to system as a whole.|$|E

40|$|International {{audience}} This presentation covers {{questions of}} how the relationship between mathematics and <b>theoretical</b> <b>music</b> throughout western history shaped modern comprehension of critical notions such as “ratio” and “proportion”; exploring the educational potentiality of such a comprehension. In order to do that, it will be consider a procedure taken by Erasmus of Höritz, a Bohemian mathematician and music theorist who emerged in the early 16 th century as a German humanists very articulate with musical matters. In order to divide the tone, Erasmus preferred to use a numerical method to approach the geometrical mean, although his procedure did not recognize itself as an approximation of the true real number value of the geometric mean. The Early Modern Period saw the growing use of geometry as an instrument for solving structural problems in <b>theoretical</b> <b>music,</b> a change not independently from those occurred in the conception of ratio/number {{in the context of}} <b>theoretical</b> <b>music.</b> In the context of recovery of interest in Greek sources, Erasmus communicated to musical readers an important fruit of such a revival and was likely the first in the Renaissance to apply explicitly Euclidean geometry to solve problems in <b>theoretical</b> <b>music.</b>  </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{automatic}} {{extraction of}} musical structure from audio {{is an important}} aspect for many music information retrieval (MIR) systems. The criteria on which structural elements in music are defined in MIR systems is often not clearly stated but typically stem from (<b>music)</b> <b>theoretical</b> or signal-based properties. In many cases, however, perceptual-based criteria are the most relevant and systems need to be trained on or modeled after the perception of structural elements in music. Here, we investigate the perception of structural boundaries to Western popular music and examine the musical cues responsible for their perception. We make links to <b>music</b> <b>theoretical</b> descriptions of structural boundaries and to computational methods for extracting structure. The methods and data presented here are useful for developing and training systems for the automatic extraction of musical structure as it is perceived by listeners...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel method for detecting harmonic boundaries in musical audio signals. These boundaries are very useful for chord analysis because they define temporal chord limits. This harmonic change driven (event driven) analysis of musical audio signals {{is a better}} basis for a following chord analysis than the traditionally frame based only concept. The method itself works with circular pitch spaces (CPS). CPSs summarize high level aspects of the audio signal like semantic and <b>music</b> <b>theoretical</b> relationships. Using CPSs entails good results in detecting harmonic changes...|$|E

40|$|Implicit {{learning}} is a core process for the acquisition of a complex, rule-based environment from mere interaction, such as motor action, skill acquisition, or language. A body of evidence suggests that implicit knowledge governs music acquisition and perception in nonmusicians and musicians, and that both expert and nonexpert participants acquire complex melodic, harmonic, and other features from mere exposure. While current findings and computational modeling largely support the learning of chunks, some results indicate learning of more complex structures. Despite the body of evidence, more research is required to support the cross-cultural validity of implicit learning and to show that core and more complex <b>music</b> <b>theoretical</b> features are acquired implicitly...|$|E
40|$|Rhythmic and metric ambiguities in Brahms ' {{compositions}} {{have been}} dis-cussed in various <b>music</b> <b>theoretical</b> approaches.

The report on the application of this method to the Second and Third Symphonies demonstrates surprising insights into the metric organiza-tion of these compositions. Furthermore it illustrates the contribution to the precise description of metric peculiarities {{in the works of}} Brahms gained by the inner metric analysis. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for synthesizing a novel soundtrack from an {{existing}} musical piece while preserving its structure and continuity from a <b>music</b> <b>theoretical</b> point of view. Existing approaches analyze a musical piece for possible cut points that allow the resynthesis of a novel soundtrack by lining up the source segments according to specified rules but fail to maintain musically correct song progression. Introducing the alignment of rhythmic and harmonic structures during transition point detection, we employ beat tracking as the analysis core component and take the human sound perception into account. Automatic segment rearrangement is improved by employing a novel belief propagation approach that enables user-defined constraints for the output soundtrack, allowing video editors or dance choreographers to tailor a soundtrack to their specific demands...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} ambient {{music in}} a comparative perspective. Taking the 1950 s as a mirror time axis, I suggest comparing Erik Satie’s ideas on Furniture music (1920 s) to Brian Eno’s notions of ambient music (1970 s onwards). Satie is considered {{as the father of}} ambient music as he was among the first people aware of the interconnection of music and ambient sounds. Music that Brian Eno creates almost thirty years later has deep roots in Satie’s concept of implementation of ambiental music, which means that the music “should last and represent the environment” (Brian Eno, “Ambient Music”, 2014). Ambiental <b>music’s</b> <b>theoretical</b> foundations can be compared to American Minimalist and environmental art. Consideration of the audio perception phenomena is also very important for understanding and Adorno’s interpretation of the term regressive listening that will be explored later in this paper. This is an attempt to study the artistic side of ambient music, which has a wide scope of applications beyond the art sphere. In this respect, I will try to state the differences between ambient music as an art intermission in our everyday life and ambient music as a control device over human behavior...|$|R
