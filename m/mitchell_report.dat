Clemens pleaded not guilty, but proceedings were complicated by prosecutorial misconduct, leading to a mistrial. The verdict from his second trial came in June 2012.

500|$|Eligible for {{induction}} {{into the}} Baseball Hall of Fame {{for the first}} time in 2011, speculation abounded that some baseball writers initially refrained from voting for Bagwell on the premise that he used performance-enhancing drugs, since most of his playing career took place during what is commonly referred to as [...] "the steroid era." [...] In spite of the speculation, no concrete evidence has surfaced linking him to the use of performance-enhancing drugs; the closest to evidence that exists is a report that surfaced that he disclosed use of androstenedione to a Houston Chronicle reporter in 1998. [...] At that time, neither the FDA nor MLB had banned its use, which apparently had already become widespread around the game. [...] Bagwell has not been connected with any of the 104 positive samples in the 2003 survey tests that were leaked. [...] Neither was he summoned for interview nor among the 89 players named in the <b>Mitchell</b> <b>Report</b> released in 2007.|$|E
