Of Trichomycterus venulosus only two specimens have been found, and it is thought the species is extinct in the rivers of the Eastern Hills, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the introduction of trout.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{or not a}} {{bystander}} intervenes <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{with their}} familiarity of the environment where the emergency occurs.

25|$|At {{very low}} doses, doxepin has not shown {{discontinuation}} or withdrawal effects nor rebound insomnia. Sustained effectiveness without apparent tolerance was demonstrated in clinical studies {{of up to}} 12weeks duration. This {{appears to be in}} contrast to over-the-counter antihistamines like diphenhydramine and doxylamine and all other first-generation antihistamines, which are associated with rapid development of tolerance and dependence (by day 3 or 4 of continuous dosing) and loss of hypnotic effectiveness. It is for this reason that, unlike doxepin, they are not recommended for the chronic management of insomnia and are advised for only short-term treatment (i.e., 1week). It is not entirely clear why doxepin and first-generation antihistamines are different in this regard, but {{it has been suggested that}} it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the lack of selectivity for the H1 receptor of the latter or <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the use of optimal doses. Unlike very-low-dose doxepin, most first-generation antihistamines also have marked anticholinergic activity as well as associated side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and confusion. This is particularly true in older people, and antihistamines with concomitant anticholinergic effects are not recommended in adults over the age of 65. Anticholinergic activity notably may interfere with the sleep-promoting effects of H1 receptor blockade.|$|E

25|$|The pre-parade segment {{today may}} include mass-displays, choir {{performances}}, school band displays, sky-diving displays, and other light-hearted performances {{to entertain the}} crowd prior to the parade proper, with the added positive effect of encouraging parade-attendees to be seated earlier. Initially introduced on an ad-hoc basis as an informal filler, it has since became {{an integral part of}} the parade particularly when live television coverage was extended to this segment in recent years.

500|$|What {{is known}} is that, on 6 April 1636, the 19-year-old Wright was apprenticed to George Jamesone, an Edinburgh {{portrait}} painter of some repute. The Edinburgh Register of Apprentices records him as [...] "Michaell, son to James W(right), tailor, citizen of London". The {{reasons for this}} move to Scotland are unclear, but <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with familial connections (his parents may have been London Scots) or the advent of plague in London. During his apprenticeship, Wright {{is likely to have}} lodged at the High Street tenement near the Netherbow Gate that served as Jameson's workplace. The apprenticeship was contracted for five years, but may have been curtailed by Jameson's imprisonment in late 1639. There is no record of any independent work by Wright from this period (his earliest known painting being a small portrait of Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury, painted in the early 1640s during his time in Rome).|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Witherspoon {{starred in}} Vanity Fair, {{adapted from the}} 19th-century classic novel Vanity Fair and {{directed}} by Mira Nair. Her character, Becky Sharp, is a poor woman with a ruthless determination to find fortune and establish herself a position in society. Witherspoon was carefully costumed to conceal that during the filming {{she was pregnant with}} her second child. This pregnancy was not a hindrance to her work as Witherspoon believed the gestation had in fact helped her portrayal of Sharp's character: [...] "I love the luminosity that pregnancy brings, I love the fleshiness, I love the ample bosom—it gave me much more to play with", she said. The film and Witherspoon's portrayal of Sharp received mixed reviews, as The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Nair's cast is splendid. Witherspoon does justice to the juicy role by giving the part more buoyancy than naughtiness." [...] At the same time, The Charlotte Observer called her work [...] "an excellent performance that's soft around the edges" [...] and the Los Angeles Times concluded that Becky is [...] "a role Reese Witherspoon was born to play". However, LA Weekly wrote [...] " [...] ends up conveying so little of what’s at once appalling and perversely attractive about the would-be mistress of Vanity Fair" [...] and states that it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Witherspoon's vanity, [...] "with an Oscar-less young star’s need to be loved more than anyone could conceivably love the “real” Becky Sharp.". Others have stated she was miscast.|$|E

2500|$|Additional {{scrutiny}} {{into the}} vague injuries and insults <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{with a simple}} matter of Montresor's pride and not any specific words from Fortunato. Montresor comes from an established family. His house had once been noble and respected, but has fallen slightly in status. Fortunato, as his name would seem to indicate, has been blessed with good fortune and wealth and is, therefore, viewed as unrefined by Montresor; however, this lack of refinement has not stopped Fortunato from surpassing Montresor in society, which could very well be the [...] "insult" [...] motive for Montresor's revenge.|$|E

2500|$|The {{usage of}} -ko (...) has changed {{significantly}} over the years: {{prior to the}} Meiji Restoration (1868), it was reserved {{for members of the}} imperial family. Following the restoration, it became popular and was overwhelmingly common in the Taishō and early Shōwa era. The suffix -ko increased in popularity after the mid-20th century. Around the year 2006, due to the citizenry mimicking naming habits of popular entertainers, the suffix -ko was declining in popularity. At the same time, names of western origin, written in kana, were becoming increasingly popular for naming of girls. By 2004 there was a trend of using hiragana instead of kanji in naming girls. Molly Hakes, author of The Everything Conversational Japanese Book: Basic Instruction For Speaking This Fascinating Language In Any Setting, said that this <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with using hiragana out of cultural pride, since hiragana is Japan's indigenous writing form, or out of not assigning a meaning to a girl's name so that others do not have a particular expectation of her.|$|E

2500|$|Wavefront-guided LASIK is a {{variation}} of LASIK surgery in which, rather than applying a simple correction of only long/short-sightedness and astigmatism (only lower order aberrations as in traditional LASIK), an ophthalmologist applies a spatially varying correction, guiding the computer-controlled excimer laser with measurements from a wavefront sensor. The goal is to achieve a more optically perfect eye, though the final result still depends on the physician's success at predicting changes that occur during healing and other factors that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the regularity/irregularity of the cornea and the axis of any residual astigmatism. Another important factor is whether the excimer laser can correctly register eye position in 3 dimensions, and to track the eye in all the possible directions of eye movement. If a wavefront guided treatment is performed with less than perfect registration and tracking, pre-existing aberrations can be worsened. In older patients, scattering from microscopic particles (cataract or incipient cataract) {{may play a role}} that outweighs any benefit from wavefront correction. Therefore, patients expecting so-called [...] "super vision" [...] from such procedures may be disappointed.|$|E
2500|$|Arthur C. Parker, Secretary of the Society of American Indians from 1911 to 1915, {{regarded}} McKenzie as the [...] "father of the movement." [...] McKenzie {{respected the}} Society's mantra of [...] "for Indians and by Indians" [...] and understood Indians' distrust of Whites. McKenzie downplayed {{his role as}} [...] "Local Representative" [...] for the Society and worked behind the scenes. He wrote to Parker, [...] "Whatever I may say is subject to two suspicions: First that my race prevents me understanding the situation. Second, that I may have some ulterior motive." [...] "I am always embarrassed by {{doubt in my mind}} as to whether I shall act and speak, or whether I shall contribute most by silence. Everyone who says anything to me tells me to proceed and that the Indians have confidence in me and I am glad and believe that is so, even though doubtful as to what extent that confidence involves action." [...] While Parker was determined that the Society should be run by Indians, it did not diminish his desire for McKenzie's counsel and assistance in managing the organization. In short time, Parker was overwhelmed with the volume of Society work and contemplated resigning. McKenzie exhorted him to stay with the Society, noting [...] "it is not impossible that you are the only man who can save the situation and that you <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it by constant correspondence, keeping all in touch one with the other, and keeping all satisfied that equal justice is being arranged for." [...] Parker teamed with McKenzie to manage the Society and navigate politics. Responsibilities included publications, planning conferences, drafting and lobbying legislation and membership services.|$|E
2500|$|India {{continues}} to assert its sovereignty or rights {{over the entire}} region of Kashmir, while Pakistan maintains {{that it is a}} disputed territory. Pakistan argues that the status quo cannot be considered as a solution and further insists on a UN-sponsored plebiscite. Unofficially, the Pakistani leadership has indicated that {{they would be willing to}} accept alternatives such as a demilitarised Kashmir, if sovereignty of Azad Kashmir was to be extended over the Kashmir valley, or the [...] "Chenab" [...] formula, by which India would retain parts of Kashmir on its side of the Chenab river, and Pakistan the other sideeffectively re-partitioning Kashmir on communal lines. The problem with the proposal is that the population of the Pakistan-administered portion of Kashmir is for the most part ethnically, linguistically, and culturally different from the Valley of Kashmir, a part of Indian-administered Kashmir. Partition based on the Chenab formula is opposed by some Kashmiri politicians, although others, including Sajjad Lone, have suggested that the non-Muslim part of Jammu and Kashmir be separated from Kashmir and handed to India. Some political analysts say that the Pakistan state policy shift and mellowing of its aggressive stance <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with its total failure in the Kargil War and the subsequent 9/11 attacks. These events put pressure on Pakistan to alter its position on terrorism. Many neutral parties to the dispute have noted that the UN resolution on Kashmir is no longer relevant.
