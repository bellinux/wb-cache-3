5|$|Cannon Building: 1-9 Broadway, on {{the south}} side of Monument Square. This 1835 {{collaboration}} by Alexander Jackson Davis and Ithiel Town got a <b>mansard</b> <b>roof</b> after an 1870 fire. Today it is used as an extended-stay hotel and office space.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, {{the hotel}} {{received}} extensive repairs in 1951. This {{consisted of a}} whole new set of top floors, while the <b>mansard</b> <b>roof</b> of the upper floors of the hotel was rebuilt in a plain neo-Georgian white brick.|$|E

5|$|Another of the property's buildings, {{commonly}} called the carriage house, never {{lived up to}} its popular name. The building never housed any carriages; it was, in fact, built to house automobiles. The southern section of the carriage house was constructed sometime between 1908 and 1912 and features a <b>mansard</b> <b>roof.</b> The building is sheathed in stucco and presently houses a collection of antique carriages and sleighs as well as a barbed wire history museum.|$|E
5|$|As Toronto's suburbs {{began to}} {{encroach}} on the family's {{property in the}} late-1800s, Jesse's wife, Elizabeth, began subdividing the lot in 1893. A second storey in Second Empire style {{was added to the}} home in 1900, with a <b>mansard</b> <b>roof,</b> while maintaining the original veranda. The house was built to the east of the old frame home, which was demolished in 1913. Elizabeth continued to live in the home until her death in 1918.|$|E
5|$|The {{house today}} appears an {{assemblage}} of several architectural styles popular during the Victorian era. While the overall design and air {{could be described as}} Italianate, also present in the same entrance facade are examples of high Victorian Gothic, such as an Italianate seigneurial tower confused in design with a campanile tower. This tower complete with a glazed loggia is crowned by a French-style <b>mansard</b> <b>roof</b> with oversized chimneys masquerading as Renaissance ornament. The centrepiece of the same facade is a porte-cochère designed in a heavy neoclassical style.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{supervision}} of foreign architects, namely the German C. Sandreczki, the Boromphiman Throne Hall became the most modern building within the Grand Palace; {{it was also the}} first to be designed to accommodate carriages and motorcars. The exterior walls are embellished with pilasters and elaborate plaster designs. The triangular and semi-circular pediments are decorated with stuccoed floral motifs. The palace's distinctive <b>Mansard</b> <b>roof</b> is covered in dark grey slate tiles. On the façade of the building, the main and central pediment show the emblem of the crown prince.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the {{original}} mansion began in April 1879, George O. Garnsey, a Chicago architect, designed the Ellwood Mansion for DeKalb barbed wire entrepreneur Isaac Ellwood. At the time, Garnsey had designed other structures in DeKalb and Sycamore. By November 1879 the Ellwood family occupied the home. Newspaper accounts of the day put the cost somewhere between US$40,000 and $50,000. The original Ellwood House {{had a number of}} elements common to Victorian designed homes and combined several styles. Its <b>mansard</b> <b>roof</b> remains one of the home's most striking features. In addition, the home still incorporates Gothic columns, pitched gables, and a cast iron roof cresting with a trefoil design.|$|E
5|$|The palace is {{structured}} {{around a large}} and paved courtyard. It has a trapezoidal plan, and the land falls away toward the river Ill. To compensate for the slope, the riverside (southern) façade of the main wing has four floors (including the <b>Mansard</b> <b>roof),</b> while the courtyard (northern) façade has three floors. The half-buried floor corresponds to the basement and now houses the archaeological museum (see below, Museums). The riverside façade is thus both the highest and the widest of the palace. The terrace before it, facing the quai des Bateliers, is closed at both ends by elaborate wrought-iron gates adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan.|$|E

5|$|As {{the postwar}} years yielded to the Gilded Age, Troy's {{prosperity}} continued. The wealth created by its industries built {{some of the}} city's most notable Victorian buildings. Frederick Clarke Withers designed First Street's Rice Building in 1871, a five-story flatiron-shaped building representative of his Victorian Gothic style. The Cannon Building got a contemporary <b>mansard</b> <b>roof</b> after two fires. Cummings' 1870 Congregation Berith Sholom Temple on Third Street is among the oldest synagogue buildings still standing in the United States, the oldest Reform synagogue in New York, {{and one of the}} most significant religious buildings in the district from this period. In 1875, George B. Post won a competition to build a new home for the Troy Savings Bank, with an upstairs auditorium. While his building was in the Renaissance Revival style of the time, its forms and decorations anticipated his later work in the Beaux-Arts vein.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the Allied bombing {{campaign}} and fierce {{fighting in the}} Battle of Berlin caused severe damage; the roof was almost completely destroyed as were the statues above the rear entrance, and there was substantial water damage. In {{the first phase of}} reconstruction in 1951, the statue of the goddess of Fortuna was removed, and is assumed to have been smelted in 1962. The remaining statues, urns, and other carvings on the exterior were removed in 1976–77 due to rain damage. It was completely refurbished in the 1990s and exterior restoration required replacement of some 180 sculptural elements, including the allegorical figures of the virtues, giant vases, window embrasures and one of the columns. The original <b>mansard</b> <b>roof</b> was reconstructed in 1998–99.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Willamette {{renamed the}} {{building}} {{in honor of the}} Reverend Alvan (Alvin) F. Waller who was instrumental in getting the hall built. Then on December 17, 1919, another fire swept through Waller Hall while school was on break for Christmas. This second fire completely gutted the five-story building, but the exterior walls remained intact. The <b>Mansard</b> <b>roof</b> and square tower were destroyed in the fire. The university rebuilt the hall the following year, and used the original plans that included the round cupola but omitted the Mansard style roof and the square tower topping the structure. Architect Fred A. Legge oversaw the rebuilding and re-design of the hall. A campaign launched in 1920 by the university was set to raise $100,000 to be used for the reconstruction of Waller, plus completing the new Lausanne Hall and adding a central heating plant.|$|E

5|$|Several hôtels particuliers (large townhouses) {{date from}} the Renaissance. Most of them have oriel windows that are {{characteristic}} of German Renaissance architecture. The grandest of these hôtels belonged to the Ebersmunster abbey {{and it has a}} large three-story granary. The Ziegler house has a beautiful oriel that shows the interest of the elite of that time in Antiquity. The oriel partly reflects Vitruvius's architectural legacy and displays the portraits of four key figures of Antiquity. Baroque architecture is visible on some later hôtels dating from the 17th and 18th century. French classical architecture and its main feature, the <b>mansard</b> <b>roof,</b> were largely employed in the 18th century. To reduce costs, buildings were still built with timber framing, but as this technique was considered too Germanic and rustic, they were often covered with a rendering imitating stone.|$|E
5|$|The Altes Stadthaus is {{arranged}} around two rectangular internal courtyards. The main section, which faces Mühlheimer Platz, has a <b>mansard</b> <b>roof</b> and is framed by four-storey turrets. The main entrance {{is at the}} southwest corner of Bottlerplatz, and the building bridges Windeckstraße, with two low arched openings. Bestelmayer's building was intended to be the nucleus of future development in the centre of Bonn. However, the only other construction there was the tax office on the corner of Mülheimer Platz and Münsterstraße, built in 1937, and some further building on Bottlerplatz. After the Neues Stadthaus—the new city administration building—was built, the main floor of the section of Altes Stadthaus facing Mühlheimer Platz was rebuilt to house the library. In the course of this restructuring, the two courtyards were roofed over and several interior walls replaced with columns. The east wing of the building was demolished {{to make way for a}} C department store.|$|E
5|$|The Blackstone is a 22-floor {{rectangular}} {{structure and}} its structural steel frame is cased in tile and plaster fireproofing. On the exterior {{south and east}} (front) elevations is a one-story base of pink granite, with high arched openings; it supports the red brick- and terra cotta-trimmed building shaft. Above the granite base are four stories of white, glazed terra cotta. The large windows of {{the second and third}} floor, which once poured natural light into the lobby, ballroom, and restaurants, have mostly been covered for a theater. The majority of the building rises as a 12-story shaft of red brick dotted with white, terra cotta window surrounds; above this section is a belt course of terra cotta and two stories of red brick. Above this, the original design included an intermediate terra cotta cornice topped by a cast-iron railing. This has been removed and replaced with red brick and white glazed brick, flush {{with the rest of the}} building. The <b>mansard</b> <b>roof</b> was originally decorated with small spires around the perimeter, and 2 very tall flagpoles.|$|E
5000|$|The Beaux-Arts {{building}} {{features a}} curved judge's bench. A stained glass window features [...] "Justice" [...] holding the scales. Tile floors {{are in the}} Mediterranean style.

5|$|The three-story {{brick house}} {{includes}} a full elevated basement and a <b>mansard</b> <b>roof</b> with steeply pitched gabled dormers. Projecting from the roofline are plain corbeled chimneys and iron gillwork, the original roofing material was slate. The 1879 {{version of the}} Ellwood House featured dormer ornamentation with finial work. The original windows were all double-hung and of modest size, occurring both singly and in pairs while showing a variety of lintel designs. The original front (east) facade appeared much different than it does at present. The front entryway has been completely altered, due to Perry Ellwood's 1911 remodeling. The original entryway featured a one-story stone porch supported with two pilasters and two granite columns. The square projecting porch bay {{was connected to the}} ground via 12 stone stairs. In the southeast corner of the house was a full three-story projecting tower set at a 45° angle {{to the rest of the}} front facade.|$|E
5|$|Renovation {{began in}} 1994 under the {{direction}} of architect Gerhard Spangenberg, with the objective of returning the building so far as possible to its original condition while not ignoring the events of the more recent past. The first priority was the removal of iron girders, particle board, and chipboards. Relics of the GDR period deemed worthy of preservation were placed either in the Museum of German History in the former Prussian arsenal or in the House of History in Bonn. The original murals and reliefs, painted over and enclosed during the GDR period, were then restored. The fountain in the Klosterstraße vestibule was accurately recreated. Four bronze bear sculptures by Ignatius Taschner were returned from the Märkisches Museum and reinstalled on replacement stone columns in the Judenstraße vestibule. Exterior restoration of the building required either restoration or replacement with replicas of some 180 sculptural elements from the tower, including the allegorical figures of the virtues, giant vases, window embrasures, and one of the columns, which had bomb damage and had merely been patched. In addition, the original <b>mansard</b> <b>roof</b> was reconstructed in 1998/99 on the west, main facade facing Jüdenstraße. The technical facilities were also updated, including ventilation equipment, elevators, lighting, and plumbing. It proved impossible to use the tower for offices because it lacked the second exit required by safety regulations. This was later rectified by the addition of office space in the roof cavity.|$|E
