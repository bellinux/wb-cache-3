25|$|An {{assignment}} in the penultimate {{round of the}} third season of The Mole required the four remaining players to draw a rough map of Dunk Island. This assignment was won after contestants Marc Jongebloed and Bob Young submitted a drawing which roughly resembled {{the map of the}} island.

500|$|Emilie de Ravin, an Australian actress, {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Shannon, speaking her dialogue with an American accent. Instead, they offered her the part of Claire; she accepted without reading the script, assuming it would just be a recurring role. While de Ravin had never been pregnant, she was able to learn of the experience from her two older sisters. She found the hot weather conditions in Hawaii difficult, later saying that [...] "in many ways, the filming is actually like the drama. You endure the <b>muggiest</b> weather in the rainforest...

5000|$|Once the {{qualifying}} session completed, Stewart commented, [...] "I {{was watching}} guys' lap times, {{and looking at}} the sheet to seeing what they practiced, and it wasn't as much an increase as what we've seen. I think, obviously, we've had a lot of cloud cover today and cool temperatures here the last couple of days, so I don't think the track changed as much and got as hot during the day as what we typically see here. I think that's the reason that we didn't have the big pick-ups. But you still anticipate that, at night, the guys are going to pick up speed. It just seems like the air's a little <b>muggier</b> right now. I don't know whether that hurt horsepower or even created more drag and kind of evened everything out." ...|$|R

25|$|Central Maui {{consists}} {{primarily of}} Kahului and Wailuku. Kahului is literally {{the center of}} the island, and tends to keep steady, high temperatures throughout the year. The micro-climate in Kahului can be at times <b>muggy,</b> but it usually feels relatively dry and is often very breezy. The Wailuku area is set closer to the West Maui Mountain range. Here, more rainfall will be found throughout the year, and higher humidity levels.|$|E
25|$|Air {{conditioning}} is {{the cooling}} and de-humidification of indoor air for thermal comfort. Using {{a system of}} coils {{as a solution to}} cool and remove moisture from <b>muggy</b> air in a printing plant that was wrinkling magazine pages, Willis Carrier invented and manufactured the world's first mechanical air conditioning unit in 1902. Carrier's invention – encompassing the first system to provide man-made control over temperature, humidity, ventilation and air quality, was first installed as a solution to the quality problems experienced at a Brooklyn printing plant, Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company. Air conditioning not only spawned a company and an industry, but also brought about profound economic, social and cultural changes.|$|E
25|$|Resuming {{in fairly}} <b>muggy,</b> heavy clouded {{conditions}} North and Haddin punished the English attack. North reached his deserved century scoring centuries on both his Test and Ashes debuts. At lunch Australia had reached 577/5. After lunch, Haddin became the destroyer-in-chief, flicking three successive Anderson deliveries to the boundary and {{closed in on}} his second Test ton with booming sixes off the ineffective English attack. When Haddin was finally dismissed, Ponting declared the Australian innings at 674/6, the largest total against England since 1934 and fourth highest in The Ashes series. In the short time before tea England failed miserably to hold on, losing Cook and Bopara. The rain started as tea was taken and play ended for the day with England 219 runs behind and in dire straits to save the match.|$|E
25|$|The race {{begins at}} 6:00 AM (previously 5:00 AM) on Holy Saturday morning, near Mile 2 on Belize's George Price Highway, a {{favorite}} road for cycling events. Recently {{there has been}} a lead-out from inside Belize City at the BTL Park with actual racing beginning on the highway. Cyclists race to the western town of San Ignacio, in the Cayo District, turn there and return to Belize City, finishing at the Marion Jones Sports Complex (formerly the National Stadium) with two laps on the asphalt track (more recently on flat straight portions of Princess Margaret Drive and Marine Parade while the Complex is under renovation). The estimated distance of the Classic is some 142.4 miles. Participation is limited mainly to amateur cyclists of any country, and cyclists from Mexico, Guatemala, Jamaica, the United Kingdom and the United States have participated. In addition to prizes awarded {{at the end of the}} race, station prizes are handed out at strategic points on the road going and coming. These prizes are usually cash donations, farm produce or certificates for trophies, jewelry and other items. Belizeans normally line the roadway to cheer on Belize's representatives in the race. While the cyclists are pushed toward Cayo by southeasterly or even easterly winds, a combination of those same fierce winds and the usual <b>muggy</b> conditions of Belize in the dry season traditionally faces cyclists on the return journey.|$|E
500|$|Dayton's climate {{features}} hot, <b>muggy</b> {{summers and}} cold, dry winters, and is either {{classified as a}} humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), using the [...] isotherm of the original Köppen scheme, or a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa), using the [...] isotherm preferred by some climatologists. Unless otherwise noted, all normal figures quoted within the text below are from the official climatology station, Dayton International Airport, at an elevation of [...] about [...] {{to the north of}} downtown Dayton, which lies within the valley of the Miami River; thus temperatures there are typically cooler than in downtown.|$|E
2500|$|Porto Alegre {{is located}} in the {{subtropical}} zone and thus features a humid subtropical climate (Cfa in Köppen climate classification).

2500|$|Typical of the Deep South, Auburn has a humid {{subtropical}} climate (Köppen Cfa), marked by mild winters, early springs, long, hot, <b>muggy</b> summers, and warm autumns. Due to its position near the Gulf of Mexico, the city receives {{a significant amount}} of rainfall—on average, [...] per yearthough there is a distinct dry season in the late summer and early fall. Severe storm activity - thunderstorms producing damaging winds and/or large hail - is common from the late winter through early summer. There is the risk of tornadoes. Owing to its proximity to the Gulf, Auburn is also subject to fringe effects from tropical storms and hurricanes in the summer and fall. Hurricanes Opal in 1995 and Ivan in 2004 are among two of the most notable tropical systems to affect the Auburn area in recent memory, bringing torrential rains and high winds.|$|E
2500|$|Dubrovnik has a {{borderline}} humid subtropical (Cfa) and Mediterranean climate (Csa) in the Köppen climate classification, {{since only}} one summer month {{has less than}} [...] of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely humid subtropical or Mediterranean.
