50|$|There {{are many}} {{deburring}} processes, {{but the most}} common are mass-finishing, spindle finishing, <b>media</b> <b>blasting,</b> sanding, grinding, wire brushing, abrasive flow machining, electrochemical deburring, electropolishing, thermal energy method, machining, and manual deburring.|$|E
5000|$|The test {{surface is}} cleaned {{to remove any}} dirt, paint, oil, grease or any loose scale that could either keep {{penetrant}} out of a defect, or cause irrelevant or false indications. Cleaning methods may include solvents, alkaline cleaning steps, vapor degreasing, or <b>media</b> <b>blasting.</b> The end goal of this step is a clean surface where any defects present {{are open to the}} surface, dry, and free of contamination. Note that if <b>media</b> <b>blasting</b> is used, it may [...] "work over" [...] small discontinuities in the part, and an etching bath is recommended as a post-blasting treatment.|$|E
50|$|Another {{approach}} is with solid cleaning <b>media</b> (<b>blasting)</b> {{which consists of}} the CO2 dry ice process: For tougher requirements pellets are used while for more sensitive materials or components CO2 in form of snow is applied. One draw back is the high energy consumption required to make dry ice.|$|E
5000|$|Divesting: The {{shell is}} hammered, <b>media</b> <b>blasted,</b> vibrated, waterjeted, or {{chemically}} dissolved (sometimes with liquid nitrogen) {{to release the}} casting. The sprue is cut off and recycled. The casting may then be cleaned up to remove signs of the casting process, usually by grinding.|$|R

This audition was a real <b>media</b> <b>blast,</b> since on the audition day it was his birthday, and many celebrities gave a big support to his singing, while sharing the information through different social networks.|$|R
50|$|Silicon carbide {{grit blast}} medium is brittle, sharp, and {{suitable}} for grinding metals and low-tensile strength, non-metallic materials. Plastic <b>media</b> <b>blast</b> equipment uses plastic abrasives that {{are sensitive to}} substrates such as aluminum, but still suitable for de-coating and surface finishing. Sand blast medium uses high-purity crystals that have low-metal content. Glass bead blast medium contains glass beads of various sizes.|$|R
50|$|Cast {{steel shot}} or steel grit {{is used to}} clean and prepare the surface before coating. Shot {{blasting}} recycles the media and is environmentally friendly. This method of preparation is highly efficient on steel parts such as I-beams, angles, pipes, tubes and large fabricated pieces. Different powder coating applications can require alternative methods of preparation such as abrasive blasting prior to coating. The online consumer market typically offers <b>media</b> <b>blasting</b> services coupled with their coating services at additional costs.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{removing}} flash, known as deflashing, is commonly performed via cutting, breaking, grinding, or tumbling. Some foundries use robot autogrinders to remove this unwanted material. It is very typical for molders {{to have their}} operators trim flash with hand tools at the molding machine between cycles. Many molders and OEMs seek out the use of batch processes including vibratory tumbling, cryogenic deflashing or <b>media</b> <b>blasting</b> to remove unwanted flash from large batches of parts.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{variants}} of the process, using various media; some are highly abrasive, whereas others are milder. The most abrasive are shot blasting (with metal shot) and sandblasting (with sand). Moderately abrasive variants include {{glass bead blasting}} (with glass beads) and <b>media</b> <b>blasting</b> with ground-up plastic stock or walnut shells and corncobs. A mild version is sodablasting (with baking soda). In addition, there are alternatives that are barely abrasive or nonabrasive, such as ice blasting and dry-ice blasting.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum {{blasting}} is {{a method}} that generates very little dust and spill, as the blast tool does dry abrasive blasting and collects used <b>blast</b> <b>media</b> and loosened particles from the surface to be treated, simultaneously. <b>Blast</b> <b>media</b> consumption is relatively low with this method, as the used <b>blast</b> <b>media</b> is automatically separated from dust and loosened particles, and reused several times.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum {{blasting}} is an {{abrasive blasting}} method, {{also referred to}} as dustless blasting or closed loop abrasive blasting. The method is characterized by a blast tool that does abrasive blasting and collects both used <b>blast</b> <b>media,</b> and loosened particles from the surface to be treated, simultaneously. The blast tool is equipped with a blast hose and a suction hose, that both run from the blast tool to a control unit. The control unit supplies the blast tool with pressurized air mixed with <b>blast</b> <b>media,</b> and sucks back dust, loosened particles and used <b>blast</b> <b>media.</b> The control unit continuously separates dust and loosened particles from the used <b>blast</b> <b>media,</b> and sends used <b>blast</b> <b>media</b> back into the pressurized air flow. The dust and loosened particles are collected in a waste bin.|$|R
50|$|Jones {{also told}} the San Francisco Temple staff {{to prepare for}} a <b>media</b> <b>blast.</b> In order to attempt to combat the damage, the Temple sent to various {{newspapers}} the document signed by Stoen claiming that Jones was the father of the child in the custody dispute after Tim Stoen had allegedly directed Jones to engage in sexual relations with Grace Stoen. Herb Caen reprinted the document in his San Francisco Chronicle column.|$|R
50|$|The {{parting line}} must occur {{along the line}} round the {{position}} of maximum dimension when viewed in the draw direction.pyeMany applications (seals, tight running molded parts) that require precision for shape control, call for removal of flashes. Secondary operations are thus employed, in addition to high precision molding dies to remove these flashes. Many molders will repair or even replace the mold tooling so that the flash is reduced to an acceptable tolerance or eliminated altogether. Secondary operations to remove parting line flash include hand trimming, vibratory tumbling, <b>media</b> <b>blasting</b> and cryogenic deflashing.|$|E
50|$|Cryogenic {{deburring}} is a {{cryogenic process}} used to remove burrs and flash from plastic and die cast workpieces. The process works by tumbling and/or abrasively blasting the workpieces at cryogenic temperature levels. The low temperatures (approximately -195 C) are achieved using liquid nitrogen, liquid carbon dioxide, or dry ice. This low temperature brings the material below its embrittlement temperature, which causes the flash or burrs {{to be easily}} removed via tumbling or <b>media</b> <b>blasting.</b> This process {{has been around since}} the 1960s to deflash plastic and rubber. Common materials that are typically cryogenically deburred with blast media include PEEK, nylon, Teflon, Delrin, polypropylene, polycarbonate, acetal, PTFE, PET, HDPE, PVC, ABS and many others.|$|E

40|$|Paint removal is {{a common}} {{maintenance}} requirement for aircraft as well as naval and land vehicles, since external paint gets damaged and loses much of its corrosion protection effectiveness with time. Paint removal is also conducted when metallic aircraft structures are inspected periodically for fatigue cracks and corrosion. The conventional methods of removing paint employed throughout the Canadian Forces mainly include chemical stripping and abrasive <b>media</b> <b>blasting.</b> Chemical stripping {{involves the use of}} hazardous chemicals, which are high in Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) and Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP). Abrasive <b>media</b> <b>blasting</b> typically results in a substantial quantity of solid waste consisting of paint and blast residues. Such waste is subject to control under increasingly stringent environmental and safety regulations and its disposal is costly. The new Atmospheric Plasma (AP) paint removal process purports to be a high chemical energy, low thermal energy (cold plasma process), that should not damage temperature sensitive substructures, such as heat treated aerospace aluminium alloys. Fatigue strength {{is one of the key}} properties in aircraft structures. In order for AP paint stripping to be accepted as an aerospace industry standard paint removal process, it must be thoroughly tested to demonstrate that it does not adversely affect the fatigue properties of the substrate. This paper investigates effect of the paint removal process on fatigue crack growth of 7075 -T 6 and 2024 -T 3 aluminium panels. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of grit {{blasting}} for thermal spray applications is to ensure a strong mechanical bond between the substrate and the coating by the enhanced roughening of the substrate material. This study presents statistically designed experiments that were accomplished to investigate the effect of abrasives on roughness for A 36 / 1020 steel. The experiments were conducted using a Box statistical design of experiment (SDE) approach. Three grit blasting parameters and their effect on the resultant substrate roughness were investigated. These include <b>blast</b> <b>media,</b> <b>blast</b> pressure, and working distance. The substrates were characterized for roughness using surface profilometry. These attributes were correlated with the changes in operating parameters. Twin-Wire Electric Arc (TWEA) coatings of aluminum and zinc/aluminum were deposited on the grit-blasted substrates.

40|$|The United States Air Force has {{developed}} plastic <b>media</b> <b>blasting</b> (PMB) to replace solvent paint stripping of its aircraft. This paint blasting operation generates a waste stream of mainly pulverized plastic, but the stream also contains enough paint pigments {{to make the}} PMB waste RCRA hazardous. A Phase I study identified density separation as the preferred treatment alternative to land disposal of the entire PMB waste stream in a hazardous landfill. This study found density separation to be a less attractive alternative to self-encapsulation, solidification/stabilization (S/S), and low-temperature ashing. Self-encapsulation resulted in a volume decrease but only moderate improvement in Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) performance Solidification/Stabilization (S/S) into cementiaous waste for resulted in excellent TCLP performances, but volume increases. Low-temperature ashing resulted in dramatic volume decreases, but off-gas control is required to contain all the RCRA metals.

40|$|The {{radioactive}} metal wastes {{that are}} generated from nuclear fuel plants and radiochemical laboratories are mainly contaminated by the surface deposition of radioactive isotopes. There are presently several techniques used in removing surface contamination involving {{physical and chemical}} processes. However, there has been very little research done {{in the area of}} soiled, heavily oxidized, and painted metals. Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory have been developing electrochemical procedures for the decontamination of bare and painted metal objects.

This study has been successful in decontaminating projectiles and shrapnel excavated during environmental restoration projects after 40 + years of exposure to the elements. Heavily corroded augers used in sampling activities throughout the area were also successfully decontaminated. This process has demonstrated its effectiveness and offers several advantages over the present metal decontamination practices of <b>media</b> <b>blasting</b> and chemical solvents.

40|$|Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is an {{additive}} manufacturing (AM) process which builds components through melting layers of powdered material together. The surface finish on these manufactured components typically requires additional manual finishing or post-processing. Traditionally, mechanical polishing techniques utilise semi skilled labour and usually requires significant time input resulting in it being an expensive and inefficient process. This paper considers less labour intensive post processing {{techniques such as}} <b>media</b> <b>blasting</b> and tumbling for SLM produced stainless steel 316 L components. In particular, {{the change in the}} surface profile due to the finishing processes employed was the primary issue for investigation. However, changes in the dimensions, geometric features and overall form were also studied. Parameters of the build process (machine operation) that ultimately impact on the final components surface finish or finishing process required, were noted and discussed. It was found that a range of surface roughness and surface finishes can be achieved using the techniques outlined above. It is possible to achieve a good surface finish using some of these techniques, although, it is obvious that these techniques are not solely sufficient for the post processing of stainless steel 316 L components...|$|E

The filters are manually back flushed to prevent clogging. After back flushing, dust is dumped from the dust chamber into the dust collection bag or drum by operation of the bellows valve. The safety and health evaluation during the testing demonstration focused on dust and noise exposure. Dust exposure was found to be minimal, but noise exposure was potentially significant. Further testing for each of these exposures is recommended because the outdoor environment where the testing demonstration took place may cause the results to be inapplicable to indoor settings.
