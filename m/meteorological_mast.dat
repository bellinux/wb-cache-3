50|$|In December 2012, after public consulation, {{the wind}} farm was reduced {{in size from}} 76.4 to 67.5 sq mi to reduce visual impact from coastal areas, with {{the maximum number of}} {{turbines}} cut from 333 to 218, and the maximum turbine height reduced from 210 to 200 m. The reduced wind farm had an estimated maximum capacity of around 1100 MW. Design expectations were for turbines of 5 to 8 MW capacity, foundation design was not finalised, but monopile foundations had been excluded from use in the southern half of the site. The offshore development would also include up to three (33 or 66 kV to 132 or 275 kV AC) offshore substations, and a <b>meteorological</b> <b>mast.</b>|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{installed}} capacity of wind turbines has increased rapidly, thereby raising the takes for wind turbine power performance testing. The current standard for power performance testing, IEC 61400 - 12 - 1, prescribes {{to measure the}} wind speed at hub height using a <b>meteorological</b> <b>mast.</b> This study tested whether Lidar, a remote measurement technology, could improve power performance testing. Potential benefits include mobility of the measurement device and increased insight in wind speed, with measurements up to approximately 200 meter height. A measurement campaign was held at a site with flat terrain by positioning a ZephIR 300 Lidar next to an IEC compliant <b>meteorological</b> <b>mast</b> to measure the power performance of two wind turbines. Wind speed measurements were compliant to Norsewind criteria with a linear regression slope of 0. 989 indicating that the Lidar measured lower wind speeds than the <b>meteorological</b> <b>mast.</b> Three major conclusions were drawn. (I) The difference in wind speed measurement has a large effect on annual energy production estimation (2. 5 % for a Rayleigh function with a mean annual wind speed of 7 m/s), but difference in power performance of two wind turbines was found by either using the <b>meteorological</b> <b>mast</b> or the Lidar. (II) The rotor equivalent wind speed approach reduced scatter in the power curve for the Lidar compared to hub height wind speed, but not compared to hub height wind speed measurement by the <b>meteorological</b> <b>mast.</b> (III) Inner- and inner+outer envelope guaranteed power curve conditions showed a difference in annual energy production of approximately 1 % for a Rayleigh function with a mean annual wind speed of 7 m/s. The most important implications are the following. (I) It is advized to use a Lidar to compare the power performance of multiple wind turbines or {{to use it for}} comparing performance over time, but it is advised not compare power performance measured for one test with a Lidar and for another test using a <b>meteorological</b> <b>mast.</b> (II) For power performance guarantee negotiations Lidar measurements could be included as option for power performance measurement and with REWS calculations the inner envelop conditions could be enlarged, but a different guaranteed power curve than when measured using a <b>meteorological</b> <b>mast</b> might be needed. (III) For flat terrain with grassland and wind turbines of approximately 100 meter hub height, rotor equivalent wind speed and veer calculations are not adding much insight and are not needed for inclusion in the power performance testing, except when used for extending inner envelope conditions...|$|E

Knowledge of the wind conditions at a potential offshore wind farm site is key in reducing investment risk.

A preliminary study in a small wind tunnel identified restrictions on the Reynolds number and terrace step size that are required for attaining adequate high-Reynolds-number boundary-layer characteristics at a scale of 1 : 1500.

40|$|AbstractTurbulence {{characteristics}} of the wind farm inflow {{have a significant impact}} on the energy production and the lifetime of a wind farm. The common approach is to use the <b>meteorological</b> <b>mast</b> measurements to estimate the turbulence intensity (TI) but they are not always available and the turbulence varies over the extent of the wind farm. This paper describes a method to estimate the TI at individual turbine locations by using the rotor effective wind speed calculated via high frequency turbine data. The method is applied to Lillgrund and Horns Rev-I offshore wind farms and the results are compared with TI derived from the <b>meteorological</b> <b>mast,</b> nacelle mounted anemometer on the turbines and estimation based on the standard deviation of power. The results show that the proposed TI estimation method is in the best agreement with the <b>meteorological</b> <b>mast.</b> Therefore, the rotor effective wind speed is shown to be applicable for the TI assessment in real-time wind farm calculations under different operational conditions. Furthermore, the TI in the wake is seen to follow the same trend with the estimated wake deficit which enables to quantify the turbulence in terms of the wake loss locally inside the wind farm...|$|E

40|$|Assessing wind {{conditions}} on complex terrain {{has become a}} hard task as terrain complexity increases. That is why {{there is a need}} to extrapolate in a reliable manner some wind parameters that determine wind farms viability such as annual average wind speed at all hub heights as well as turbulence intensities. The development of these tasks began in the early 90 ´s with the widely used linear model WAsP and WAsP Engineering especially designed for simple terrain with remarkable results on them but not so good on complex orographies. Simultaneously non-linearized Navier Stokes solvers have been rapidly developed in the last decade through CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) codes allowing simulating atmospheric boundary layer flows over steep complex terrain more accurately reducing uncertainties.

40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{is proposed}} for scaling Doppler lidar observations of wind gusts {{to make them}} comparable with those observed at a <b>meteorological</b> <b>mast.</b> Doppler lidars can then be used to measure wind gusts in regions and heights where traditional <b>meteorological</b> <b>mast</b> measurements are not available. This novel method also provides estimates for wind gusts at arbitrary gust durations, including those shorter than the temporal resolution of the Doppler lidar measurements. The input parameters for the scaling method are the measured wind-gust speed {{as well as the}} mean and standard deviation of the horizontal wind speed. The method was tested using WindCube V 2 Doppler lidar measurements taken next to a 100 m high <b>meteorological</b> <b>mast.</b> It is shown that the method can provide realistic Doppler lidar estimates of the gust factor, i. e. the ratio of the wind-gust speed to the mean wind speed. The method reduced the bias in the Doppler lidar gust factors from 0. 07 to 0. 03 and can be improved further to reduce the bias by using a realistic estimate of turbulence. Wind gust measurements are often prone to outliers in the time series, because they represent the maximum of a (moving-averaged) horizontal wind speed. To assure the data quality in this study, we applied a filtering technique based on spike detection to remove possible outliers in the Doppler lidar data. We found that the spike detection-removal method clearly improved the wind-gust measurements, both with and without the scaling method. Spike detection also outperformed the traditional Doppler lidar quality assurance method based on carrier-to-noise ratio, by removing additional unrealistic outliers present in the time serie...|$|E

Easterly wind is investigated at Hövsöre site to study the behaviour of the overland wind shear and wind turning from November 2008 to April 2009. In this study, data are analysed based on average 10 -min wind speeds and wind directions diurnal, monthly and during the whole period of measurements. The results show that first, the wind speed profile of <b>meteorological</b> <b>mast</b> and lidar are in agreement to different stability classes. Second, the wind direction profile changes with height reasonable in all stability conditions except in very unstable and unstable cases.
