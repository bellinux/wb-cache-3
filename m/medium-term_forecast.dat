40|$|Issues of <b>medium-term</b> <b>forecasting</b> of the {{economic}} growth in Bulgaria are considered. Econometric models are used {{for the purpose of}} <b>medium-term</b> <b>forecasting</b> of {{the economic}} growth in this country. The study is organized as follows. In the first section theoretical issues of the modlling and forecasting {{of the economic}} growth in Bulgaria as a country in transition are presented. In particular, the specificities and main patterns of macroeconomic development since the start of transition is described as an undefinite and unfavourable basis for <b>forecasting</b> in <b>medium-term.</b> The quality of statistical data (the time series) in the last over 10 years reflecting the transition economic reality is discussed as well as the nature of the applied models. In the second section <b>medium-term</b> <b>forecasts</b> for Bulgaria's economic growth based mainly on regression analysis are produced. Two alternative scenarios for Bulgaria's accession to the EU are calculated: one that assumes accession in 2007, and another that assumes that the country will not accede to the EU before 2010 (the status quo scenario). A production function is also applied taking into account the theory of endogenous growth. Finally concluding comments are given. ...|$|R

The data period covers {{more than eight}} years of daily observations, January 1991 to March 1999, for the spot exchange rate, 1 - and 3 -month volatility of the DEM/JPY, GBP/DEM, GBP/USD, USD/CHF, USD/DEM and USD/JPY. Comparing {{with the results of}} 'pure' time series models, the reported work investigates whether market implied volatility data can add value in terms of <b>medium-term</b> <b>forecasting</b> accuracy. This is done using data directly available from the marketplace {{in order to avoid the}} potential biases arising from 'backing out' volatility from a specific option pricing model. On the basis of the over 34 000 out-of-sample forecasts produced, evidence tends to indicate that, although no single volatility model emerges as an overall winner in terms of forecasting accuracy, the 'mixed' models incorporating market data for currency volatility perform best most of the time. forecasting accuracy, implied volatility, model combination, volatility models,...|$|R

Evidence is drawn from surveys and interviews with IMF staff, country authorities, {{and representatives of the}} private sector, as well as a quantitative analysis of forecast errors. Results indicate that IMF <b>medium-term</b> <b>forecasts</b> of GDP growth meet basic efficiency standards for about 70 – 80 percent of the member countries. There is no evidence of a systemic or built-in organizational bias specifically caused by the approach used by the IMF to produce <b>medium-term</b> <b>forecasts.</b> Stakeholders have a generally positive view of such forecasts and highly value the Fund’s medium-term analysis based on them. On the other hand, the tendency to overpredict GDP growth (i. e., an optimistic bias), previously found in other studies, exists for several countries in all IMF area departments and regardless of development stage and IMF program participation status.

Then, smaller earthquakes are ‘witnesses’ of the seismogenic process and not ‘actors’ as in the well-known branching model ETAS (Ogata 1989). Several versions of the EEPAS model have been used to generate forecasts of seismicity for the next 3 months. They have been tested at the California CSEP testing center since January 2008.

40|$|Reliable {{medium-term}} forecasts {{are essential}} for forward-looking monetary policy decisionmaking. Traditionally, predictions of the exchange rate tend {{to be linked to}} the equilibrium concept implied by the purchasing power parity (PPP) theory. In particular, the traditional benchmark for exchange rate models is based on a linear adjustment of the exchange rate to the level implied by PPP. In the presence of aggregation effects, transaction costs or uncertainty, however, economic theory predicts that the dynamics of the nominal exchange rate around the equilibrium value implied by PPP are nonlinear. This paper presents some of the shortcomings of the traditional linear exchange rate models and assesses whether alternative nonlinear formulations outperform them for forecasting purposes. We find that the theory of nonlinear adjustment to PPP is supported by the data in a threshold cointegration framework for the monthly EUR/USD exchange rate between 1990 and 2010. Furthermore, sizeable gains in terms of <b>medium-term</b> <b>forecast</b> accuracy can be obtained using nonlinear specifications. exchange rates, purchasing power parity, nonlinearity, threshold models...|$|E

For most of this period, however, it was the University of Bonn who developed and maintained the resulting models, under contract to Eurostat. The model as a whole was called the SPEL/EU-system and consisted of three parts: a base model, a short-term forecast model and a <b>medium-term</b> <b>forecast</b> model. With most of the data in the base model coming directly from Eurostat, it was Eurostat’s eventual aim that it should be able to maintain this base model itself. To this end, development of the agricultural information system (AgrIS) was started in 1999. The AgrIS continues to use the concepts of the SPEL-system. The decision was taken, however, to rewrite the whole system with new software. Eurostat has chosen to develop AgrIS with the Microsoft development tools (Excel in combination with Access).

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} long-term {{trends in}} energy intensity for ten Asian emerging countries {{to test for}} a non-monotonic relationship between energy intensity and income in our sample. We estimate energy demand functions during 1973 1990 using a quadratic function of log income. We find that the long-run coefficient on squared income is negative and significant, indicating a change in trend of energy intensity. We then use our estimates to evaluate a <b>medium-term</b> <b>forecast</b> of energy demand in the Asian countries, using both a log-linear and a quadratic model. We find that in medium to high income countries the quadratic model performs better than the log-linear, with an average error of 9 % against 43 % in 1995. For {{the region as a}} whole, the quadratic model appears more adequate with a forecast error of 16 % against 28 % in 1995.

40|$|Measured {{on average}} for the period 1997 - 2001, real GDP will {{increase}} {{at a rate of}} 2. 4 percent per year, 1 percentage point more than for the preceding five-year period. While exports are currently the driving force behind economic growth, additional stimulus should come from investment in the course of 1998. Because of sluggish growth in household disposable income, private consumption will only pick up gradually and to a limited extent. The forecast decline in the current account deficit from 2 percent (1997) to approximately 1 percent of GDP is largely attributable to an improvement in the trade balance. In 1997, the general government deficit will fall well below the 3 percent target established by the Maastricht Treaty and should decline below 2 percent of GDP {{at the end of the}} projection period.
