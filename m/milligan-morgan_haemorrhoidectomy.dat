40|$|The aim of {{this double}} blind {{randomized}} clinical trial was to compare the short-term and long-term outcomes of stapled haemorrhoidopexy (SH group) performed using a circular stapler {{with that of the}} <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>haemorrhoidectomy</b> (MMH group). A total of 79 consecutive patients with grade III haemorrhoids were randomized into two groups treated with SH (n. 39) and MMH (n. 40). The outcomes of the procedures were evaluated postoperatively and over a follow-up period of minimum 2 years. Patients undergoing the SH procedure showed greater short term advantages than MMH group with reduced pain, shorter length of hospital stay, earlier return to work and high patient satisfaction. Long-term follow-up has indicated more favourable results in MMH group in terms of resumption of symptoms with absence of residual prolapse and risk of recurrence of prolapse. At two years follow-up recurrent prolapse was confirmed in six patients of SH group (13...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> {{excision}} <b>haemorrhoidectomy</b> {{remains a}} very popular treatment modality for third and fourth degree haemorrhoids due to its cost effectiveness and good long-term results. The LigaSure tissue-sealing device is an alternative technique used in haemorrhoidectomy that {{has been shown to}} produce favourable results. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effectiveness of the LigaSure tissue sealing device in comparison with conventional diathermy haemorrhoidectomy. Methods A prospective clinical trial was conducted. Patients with newly diagnosed haemorrhoids requiring haemorrhoidectomy were randomized to either LigaSure haemorrhoidectomy or diathermy haemorrhoidectomy. Surgical technique and postoperative care was standardized. Outcome measures were operative time and bleeding, postoperative pain (measured on a visual analogue scale) and rate of wound healing. Results We randomized 44 patients, 22 to LigaSure and 22 to diathermy; 43 patients were evaluated. They were aged between 19 and 71 years.

40|$|AIM: To {{demonstrate}} {{the value of}} Diosmin (flavonidic fraction) {{in the management of}} post-haemorhoidectomic symptoms. METHODS: Eighty-six consecutive patients with grades III and IV acute mixed hemorrhoids admitted to the Anorectal Surgical Department of First Affiliated Hospital, Xinjiang Medical University from April 2009 to April 2010, were enrolled in this study. An observer-blinded, randomized trial was conducted to compare post-haemorhoidectomic symptoms with use of Diosmin flavonidic fraction vs placebo. Eighty-six patients were randomly allocated to receive Diosmin flavonidic fraction 500 mg for 1 wk (n = 43) or placebo (n = 43). The <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> open <b>haemorrhoidectomy</b> was performed by a standardized diathermy excision method. Pain, bleeding, heaviness, pruritus, wound edema and mucosal discharge were observed after surgery. The postoperative symptoms and hospitalization time were recorded. RESULTS: The mean age of the Diosmin group and controls was 53. 2 and 51. 3 years, respectively. In Diosmin group, haemorrhoid piles were of the third degree in 33 patients and the fourth degree in 10; and in the control group, 29 were of the third degree and 14 were of the fourth degree. There was no statistically significance in age, gender distribution, degree and number of excised haemorrhoid piles, and the mean duration of haemorrhoidal disease between the two groups. There was a statistically significant improvement in pain, heaviness, bleeding, pruritus from baseline to the 8 th week after operation (P < 0. 05). Patients taking Diosmin had a shorter hospitalization stay after surgery (P < 0. 05). There was also a significant improvement on the proctoscopic appearance (P < 0. 001). However, there was no statistical {{difference between the two groups}} in terms of wound mucosal discharge. Two patients experienced minor bleeding at the 8 th week in Diosmin group, and underwent surgery. CONCLUSION: Diosmin is effective in alleviating postoperational symptoms of haemorrhoids. Therefore, it should be considered for the initial treatment after haemorrhoid surgery. However, further prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm the findings of this study...|$|R

Since 1995 an internal sphincterotomy of about 1 cm has been performed at the end of the procedure. The data concerning the complications of these two groups were compared. All the patients received a check-up at one and six months after operation and a telephone questionnaire three years after operation to evalue medium and long term results. Results after one month 507 patients (72. 5 %) did not have any postoperative complication. Only 192 patients (27. 46 %) out of 699 presented postoperative complication and the most frequent one (23. 03 %) was pain. The number of patients who suffered from postoperative pain decreased significantly when performing internal sphincterotomy, going from 28. 8 % down to 10. 45 % (χ 2 : 10, 880; p = 0, 0001); 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 24. 7 to 28. 9 (group A) and 10. 17 to 10. 72 (group B). In 51 cases (7. 29 %) urinary retention was registered. Six cases of bleeding (0. 85 %) were registered. Medium and long term follow up did not show any difference among the two groups. Conclusion internal sphincterotomy: reduces significantly pain only in the first postoperative period, but not in the medium-long term follow up; does not increase the incidence of continence impairment when performed; does not influence the incidence of the other postoperative complications especially as regard medium and long term results. </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether topical application of 0. 2 % glyceryl trinitrate ointment could reduce post-haemorrhoidectomy healing time and pain both at rest and during defecation. Thirty patients with grade III and IV haemorrhoids were included in the study and divided into two groups. All patients underwent <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>haemorrhoidectomy,</b> and anorectal manometry was performed before surgery and after 5 and 30 days. In one group a placebo ointment was applied to the perianal wounds, while in the other group a 0. 2 % glyceryl trinitrate ointment was used. Maximum resting pressure was reduced in the glyceryl trinitrate group and increased in the placebo group after 5 days. Postoperative pain both at rest and during defecation, and the time to healing and return to normal activity were significantly reduced in the glyceryl trinitrate group, whilst analgesic consumption was similar. An elevated incidence of headache was observed In the glyceryl trinitrate group. Topical application of glyceryl trinitrate was effective in reducing postoperative pain and healing time, but the substantial incidence of side effects may limit its extensive use...|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of haemorrhoids has evolved rapidly {{during the past}} few decades. Several new treatments have been proposed with the aim of reducing patients' postoperative pain, time to return to normal life, risk of early and late complications, and recurrence rate. Although conservative treatment based on dietary and lifestyle changes can help the majority of patients, and rubber band ligation and phlebotonic drugs can effectively treat grade I and II haemorrhoids, surgery is required for the most advanced stages. <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>haemorrhoidectomy</b> is considered to be the gold-standard approach for grade IV haemorrhoids. An increasing number of minimally invasive treatment options, including mucopexy with or without mucosal resection and haemorrhoid artery ligation, have now been proposed for the {{management of}} grade III haemorrhoids. These approaches aim to correct the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the aetiology of haemorrhoids. An increased risk of recurrence is the price to pay for these minimally invasive and less painful treatments, but the sparing of the sensitive anoderm and a rapid return to normal life without pain are greatly appreciated by patients. An algorithm for the management of haemorrhoids using evidence-based medicine is also presented her...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess patient dissatisfaction and {{functional}} symptoms following haemorrhoid surgery, aspects of which are seldom covered in other published series. METHOD: A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to 359 consecutive patients (prospective database; 198 men, 161 women; median follow up, 59 [1 - 120] months) who underwent either <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>haemorrhoidectomy</b> (n= 205) or stapled haemorrhoidopexy (n= 154). RESULTS: The response rate was 72 %; 2. 4 % of patients had no opinion, 13. 6 % were dissatisfied, 33. 0 % were satisfied, and 51. 0 % were very satisfied with the treatment. Dissatisfied patients were more likely to be women and more likely to have a long history of constipation and irritable bowel syndrome. The duration of surgery and the rates of pre- and postoperative complications did not differ between groups. Residual bleeding (49 % vs 32 %), prolapse (67 % vs 31 %) and pain (91 % vs 55 %) occurred more frequently in the dissatisfied group compared with the satisfied group (P< 0. 001). Incontinence (4 [0 - 16] vs 1 [0 - 15]; P= 0. 0003) and constipation (19 [1 - 34] vs 8 [0 - 31]; P< 0. 0001) scores were significantly higher in the dissatisfied group compared with satisfied patients. Anal pain was the predominant symptom associated with dissatisfaction in a logistic regression model. CONCLUSION: Persistent pain remains the major long-term factor associated with dissatisfaction after surgery for haemorrhoids...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{postoperative}} evolution {{and the long-term}} efficacy after stapled haemorrhoidopexy (PPH) and <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>haemorrhoidectomy</b> (MM). Methods: In a prospective randomized study, 40 patients requiring surgical treatment for prolapsing haemorrhoids grade II or III were assigned to either MM or PPH (20 each). Postoperative pain, wound healing were evaluated, as well as anal pressures and sphincter anatomy. Mean follow-up is 46 months. Results: Postoperative pain at rest and during defecation was less important after PPH if no resection of external piles or skin tags was associated (P < 0. 0001). Healing time was shorter after PPH (P < 0. 0001). Endoanal ultrasound remained unchanged postoperatively. Resting and squeeze pressures decreased after MM, but not after PPH (P < 0. 01). After a mean follow-up of 46 months (12 - 56), persistent or recurrent symptoms, mostly mild and temporary, were observed after both MM and PPH, in 7 and 11 patients respectively (NS). After PPH, five patients (25 %) complained of recurrent external swelling and/or prolapse (P = 0. 047 vs. MM) requiring redo surgery in four of them, after 10, 13, 14 and 21 months. No redo-surgery was required after MM. Long term patient satisfaction after PPH was not better than after MM. Conclusions: Postoperative pain is less important after PPH. This advantage disappears if any resection {{is associated with the}} stapling. At medium to long-term follow-up, PPH seems to carry a higher risk of symptomatic external haemorrhoidal disease, needing further surgery. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Ligation {{excision}} haemorrhoidectomies {{are usually}} done on inpatient basis. Over the years however, {{there has been}} an increase in the numbers done on outpatient basis. This retrospective review was conducted to evaluate the results of day case haemorrhoidectomy in a developing country. : Forty three consecutive patients, who met the criteria for day case surgery, had ligation excision haemorrhoidectomy, between January 2004 and September 2005 at the Royal Victoria Teaching Hospital (RVTH) Banjul with the intention of same-day discharge from hospital. For each patient, data collected included age, sex, duration of symptoms, degree of haemorrhoids, and duration of rest after the procedure in minutes or hours, whether the patient was discharged same day or needed admission for complications. Local anaesthesia, 1 % lignocaine was used for all the patients. : Forty three patients comprising 28 males (65. 1 %) and 15 females (34. 9 %), with a male female ratio of 1. 87 : 1 underwent planned day case haemorrhoidectomy. Their mean age was 36. 27 +/- 10. 26 years and range was 25 to 56 years. Forty patients (93 %) were discharged on the same day of surgery after a rest period in the day care theatre ranging between 25 minutes and 60 minutes with a mean of 41. 2 +/- 11. 08 minutes. Three (7 %) of the patients required admission, two for acute urinary retention and control of excessive pain and the other 5 days postoperative on account of secondary haemorrhage. Pain control was achieved by oral non steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. There were no deaths and majority of the patients were satisfied with the procedure. : Ligation excision (<b>Milligan-Morgan)</b> <b>haemorrhoidectomy</b> is safe and can be performed successfully on out patient basis, saving inpatient health care costs.

40|$|One hundred haemorrhoid {{patients}} {{were compared with}} 300 matched control persons. Haemorrhoid symptoms and bowel symptoms were studied. Most common symptom of the patients was bleeding (44 %), followed by prolapse (24 %), hygiene problem (14 %), pain (12 %) and itching (5 %). Bowel symptoms, as bloating and evacuation difficulties, possibly related to IBS, were frequent among the patients. 556 {{patients were}} operated upon with <b>Milligan-Morgan</b> <b>haemorrhoidectomy.</b> 418 (81 %) answered a questionnaire on results, and on disturbances in anal continence. Totally 140 (33 %) reported recurrence, and 139 (33 %) patients reported anal incontinence. Forty of the 139 patients associated this to the surgical procedure. Female gender was associated to increased risk of incontinence. The 40 patients who reported incontinence, were invited to undergo ano-rectal manometry, saline infusion test, endo-anal ultrasound, proctoscopy and clinical examination. Altogether 19 patients approved to participate. Matched control subjects and 15 persons previously operated for haemorrhoids, but without symptoms of incontinence, served as two reference groups. Incontinence score and saline infusion test showed significantly poorer continence in the patient group. Endo-anal ultrasound showed injury to the external sphincter in 20 % of the patients. Anal pressure was slightly lower in the patient group, but {{the difference was not}} significant. Totally 225 patients were randomised to Milligan-Morgan or Ferguson haemorrhoidectomy. Primary aim was to study changes in anal continence. Other aims were to study postoperative pain, wound healing, complications, patient satisfaction and recurrence and changes in bowel function. Patients in the Ferguson group reported, slightly quicker wound healing (P= 0. 06). Postoperative pain was equal, as was rate of complications. After one year the Ferguson group reported lower incontinence score, and more satisfied patients. Recurrence rate was equal, 15 - 17 %. Most bowel symptoms were reduced one year after surgery. In conclusion, functional bowel symptoms are common in haemorrhoid patients. Haemorrhoidectomy is associated with risk for incontinence in 5 - 10 % of patients and females are at greater risk. A proportion of the patients who claim postoperative incontinence have physiological signs of sphincter incompetence, and external sphincter injuries are observed in those patients. Ferguson haemorrhoidectomy results in better anal continence and more satisfied patients...|$|E
