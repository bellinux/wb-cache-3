40|$|The {{usage of}} {{databases}} containing 3 D information {{is getting more}} and more importance in various domains like traffic management, urban construction, simulation of safety critical driver assistance systems etc. Nevertheless current approaches do not tap the full potential of such databases. Most of them are set up by hand and do only contain data suitable for one main purpose. In this paper a tool chain approach is presented that combines automatically generation of 3 D landscapes with precise real world data (like cadastral plans, road <b>measurement,</b> <b>aerial</b> photographs, navigation data, etc.) for usage in more than one field of application. This tool chain is developing by the Institute of Transportation Systems within the project called “SimWorld”. SimWorld sets up a database in the domain for transportation research. Therefore it was necessary to focus on road representation in a new and very detailed way. Additionally a representation of urban environment and rural areas including high quality visualization needs to be generated out of this data. A special database schema reflects these both issues. In the following the database design and the tool chain modules will be discussed in comparison to existing approaches and explained in detail. Also the topic of the project outcome and the further development of the Sim-World tool chain will be touched on...|$|E
40|$|The Institute of Transportation Systems of the German Aerospace Center {{recently}} started operating a large-scale research facility called Application Platform for Intelligent Mobility (AIM) {{to support the}} development and evaluation of Intelligent Transport Systems and mobility applications in the urban area of Braunschweig, Germany. The overarching goals are to improve safety for all traffic participants, to increase efficiency of traffic flows, and to protect resources. An {{important part of this}} new research facility is to provide a reference track on a public road surrounding the downtown, which will be equipped with ITS Roadside Stations for Vehicle-to-X (V 2 X) communication and additional sensors (e. g. cameras) for comprehensive data collection. Also communication to a traffic management centre and distribution of data to vulnerable road users and passengers via one of the regular WLAN standards is envisaged. One important purpose of the reference track is the development and efficient field operational test of ITS applications that use V 2 X communication. Before testing new applications or algorithms in a realistic environment it is necessary to evaluate them in a simulation, first. AIM will support this development step by providing a virtual counterpart to the reference track. A large part of Braunschweig is digitally represented {{with the help of a}} GIS database developed by a tool chain called SimWorld Urban. A virtual landscape (as a 3 D model) and a logical road description (using the de facto standard OpenDRIVE) are automatically generated out of real world data (like cadastral plans, road <b>measurement,</b> <b>aerial</b> photographs, navigation data, etc.). By providing a higher level of reality the currently existing gap between simulation and test trial results will be significantly reduced and therefore significantly lowers the risk of conducting potentially expensive field operational tests with immature applications. The paper will explain the concept of this approach and its challenges...|$|E

Exhibiting a characteristic local stratigraphy of permeable advance outwash over the impermeable proglacial lacustrine clay, this bluff {{is located in}} an area of Seattle at high risk from landslides. This project addressed the relationship between the joints observed at this coastal bluff and the coherency of the bluff as a whole, through remote sensing and field <b>measurements.</b> <b>Aerial</b> drone photography taken of the bluff was processed through a photogrammetry software to produce a 3 -dimensional Structure from Motion model, allowing for a digital manipulation and broad examination of the bluff not possible by foot. Stereonet plots produced from these measurements provided insight into patterns of varying joint strike along a horizontal transect of the observed bluff face. Taken together, these two visualizations provided a better picture of the possible chicken-and-egg interaction of the joints and bluff topography; they demonstrated the likelihood that the joint formation at the bluff was most likely to be primarily influenced by the local topography of the bluff over other sources of possible tensional stress in the immediate area...|$|R
30|$|All {{data are}} subject to human error and {{limitations}} {{on their ability to}} accurately and realistically represent nature, based on the spatial scale and precision of measurements taken. According to the USDA NRCS, Soil Survey Division Staff ([1995]), the US General soil map (STATSGO) is made by generalizing more detailed maps and is not suitable for local planning or productivity analyses. Semi-detailed maps like SSURGO, are based on field <b>measurements,</b> <b>aerial</b> photography and visual inspection of landscape features. They are considered suitable for determining differences and similarities in the soil characteristics of land areas greater than approximately 1 ha and can be used for planning on the level of farms and forests. They are also recommended for use in modeling with other environmental datasets representing geology, vegetation, elevation and climate. SSURGO soil maps are not meant to be used in place of onsite sampling for specific locations and uses. Soils grouped into one map unit will {{have a great deal of}} variation in reality, and land use practices will alter soil characteristics from their originally mapped condition (USDA NRCS, Soil Survey Division Staff [1993]). Therefore, it is imperative to make detailed measurements on specific plots for field research studies and monitoring programs.|$|R

40|$|Various geomatic {{measurement}} techniques can be efficiently combined for surveying glacier fronts. Aerial photographs and satellite {{images can be}} used to determine the position of the glacier terminus. If the glacier front is easily accessible, the classic surveys using theodolite or total station, GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) techniques, laser-scanner or close-range photogrammetry are possible. When the accessibility to the glacier front is difficult or impossible, close-range photogrammetry proves to be useful, inexpensive and fast. In this paper, a methodology combining photogrammetric methods and other techniques is applied to determine the calving front position of Johnsons Glacier. Images taken in 2013 with an inexpensive nonmetric digital camera are georeferenced to a global coordinate system by measuring, using GNSS techniques, support points in accessible areas close to the glacier front, from which control points in inaccessible points on the glacier surface near its calving front are determined with theodolite using the direct intersection method. The front position changes of Johnsons Glacier during the period 1957 – 2013, {{as well as those of}} the land-terminating fronts of Argentina, Las Palmas and Sally Rocks lobes of Hurd glacier, are determined from different geomatic techniques such as surface-based GNSS <b>measurements,</b> <b>aerial</b> photogrammetry and satellite optical imagery.

30|$|Changes in {{the extent}} and mass balance of glaciers are {{important}} primarily because of their impact on water resources. Yet, while there is extensive information about glacier area change, less is known about changes in glacier volume and mass, either observed or projected. Within the domain of Northern Eurasia, assessments of changes of glacier mass on a regional scale are available for the Tien-Shan mountain system using Landsat and Corona satellite imagery which provided data on volume change (e.g., Pieczonka and Bolch 2015) and Gravity Recovery Satellite Experiment (GRACE) data (e.g., Farinotti et al. 2015). The latter provides data on changes in ice mass and is therefore directly relevant to the assessment of water resources. Yet for regions other than the Tien-Shan, the uncertainty of measurements using GRACE remains very high and often exceed the measured signal (Jacob et al. 2012). In other regions, changes in the mass and volume of ice are characterized using traditional glaciological surveyors’ pole measurements of mass balance at the benchmark glaciers (World Glacier Monitoring Service 2015). Geodetic mass balance for smaller areas is based on using in situ geodetic <b>measurements,</b> <b>aerial</b> photography and high-resolution satellite imagery (e.g., Shahgedanova et al. 2012), and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) measurements performed both in situ and from the air (e.g., Kutuzov et al. 2015).

40|$|Storglaciären, {{located in}} the Kebnekaise massif in {{northern}} Sweden, {{has a long history}} of glaciological research. Early photo documentations date back to the late 19 th century. Measurements of front position variations and distributed mass balance have been carried out since 1910 and 1945 / 46, respectively. In addition to these in-situ <b>measurements,</b> <b>aerial</b> photographs have been taken at decadal intervals since the beginning of the mass balance monitoring program and were used to produce glaciological maps. Inaccuracies in the maps were a challenge to early attempts to derive glacier volume changes and resulted in major differences when compared to the direct glaciological mass balances. In this study, we reanalyzed dia-positives of the original aerial photographs of 1959, - 69, - 80, - 90 and - 99 based on consistent photogrammetric processing. From the resulting digital elevation models and orthophotos, changes in length, area, and volume of Storglaciären are computed between the survey years, including an assessment of related errors. Between 1959 and 1999, Storglaciären lost an ice volume of 19 &times; 10 6 m 3 , which corresponds to a cumulative ice thickness loss of 5. 69 m and a mean annual loss of 0. 14 m. This ice loss resulted largely from a strong volume loss during the period 1959 – 1980 and was partly compensated during the period 1980 – 1999. As a consequence, the glacier shows a strong retreat in the 1960 s, a slowing in the 1970 s, and pseudo-stationary conditions in the 1980 s and 1990 s...|$|R
40|$|Aquatic reed is an {{important}} indicator for the ecological assessment of freshwater lakes. Monitoring is essential to document its expansion or deterioration and decline. The applicability of Green-LiDAR data for the status assessment of aquatic reed beds of Bavarian freshwater lakes was investigated. The study focused on mapping diagnostic structural parameters of aquatic reed beds by exploring 3 D data provided by the Green-LiDAR system. Field observations were conducted over 14 different areas of interest along 152 cross-sections. The data indicated the morphologic and phenologic traits of aquatic reed, which were used for validation purposes. For the automatic classification of aquatic reed bed spatial extent, density and height, a rule-based algorithm was developed. LiDAR data allowed for the delimitating of the aquatic reed frontline, as well as shoreline, and therefore an accurate quantification of extents (Hausdorff distance = 5. 74 m and RMSE of cross-sections length 0. 69 m). The overall accuracy measured for aquatic reed bed density compared to the simultaneously recorded aerial imagery was 96 % with a Kappa coefficient of 0. 91 and 72 % (Kappa = 0. 5) compared to field measurements. Digital Surface Models (DSM), calculated from point clouds, similarly showed {{a high level of}} agreement in derived heights of flat surfaces (RMSE = 0. 1 m) and showed an adequate agreement of aquatic reed heights with evenly distributed errors (RMSE = 0. 8 m). Compared to field <b>measurements,</b> <b>aerial</b> laser scanning delivered valuable information with no disturbance of the habitat.

Two interpreters employed a method that utilises a stereoscope and sample-point graticule for manual quantified <b>measurements</b> of <b>aerial</b> woody cover. Both interpreters generated highly significant models accounting for 77 and 78 % of deviance. Photoscale {{appears to have a}} consistent effect whereby the signature of woody cover increases as the photoscale decreases from 1 : 25 000 to 1 : 80 000, although the magnitude of this effect was different between interpreters. The results suggest no substantial differences in the shape of models predicting crown cover between Acacia- and Eucalyptus-dominated land types, although the precision of the models was greater for the Acacia (90 – 91 % of residual deviance) than for the Eucalyptus (50 – 56 % of residual deviance) land type. The reduced accuracy in the Eucalyptus land type probably reflects the relatively diffuse crowns of the dominant trees. The models generated for this dataset are within the range of those from other calibration studies employing photography of a range of scales and methodologies. The effect of photoscale is verified between the available studies, but there may also be variations arising from methodological differences or image properties.

The conceptual model illustrates key processes controlling sediment dynamics in the upper Yuba River watershed and was tested and revised using field <b>measurements,</b> <b>aerial</b> photography, and low elevation videography. Field reconnaissance included mass wasting and channel storage inventories, assessment of annual channel change in upland tributaries, and evaluation of the relative importance of sediment sources and transport processes. Hillslope erosion rates throughout the study area are relatively low when compared to more rapidly eroding landscapes such as the Pacific Northwest and notable hillslope sediment sources include highly erodible andesitic mudflows, serpentinized ultramafics, and unvegetated hydraulic mine pits. Mass wasting dominates surface erosion on the hillslopes; however, erosion of stored channel sediment is the primary contributor to annual sediment yield. We used GIS to spatially distribute the components of the conceptual model and created hillslope erosion potential and channel storage models. The GIS models exemplify the conceptual model in that landscapes with low potential evapotranspiration, sparse vegetation, steep slopes, erodible geology and soils, and high road densities display the greatest hillslope erosion potential and channel storage increases with increasing stream order. In-channel storage in upland tributaries impacted by hydraulic mining is an exception. Reworking of stored hydraulic mining sediment in low-order tributaries continues to elevate upper Yuba River sediment yields. Finally, we propose that spatially distributing the components of a conceptual model in a GIS framework provides a guide for developing more detailed sediment budgets or numerical models making it an inexpensive way to develop a roadmap for understanding sediment dynamics at a watershed scale...|$|R
