2500|$|In June 1949, Hardwick {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} while clamming at Church's Beach on Cuttyhunk Island off the coast of Massachusetts. [...] A friend {{reported}} that Hardwick suddenly toppled into the water as they walked along the shore. [...] Shortly after Hardwick's death, sports columnist Grantland Rice wrote a column about Hardwick in which he observed:"Tack Hardwick has been a close friend of mine for 35 years. [...] Of all the college football players I've ever known since 1900, I would say he was top man in the matter of flaming spirit. [...] He loved football with an intensity beyond belief. [...] Tack was a great halfback and a great end. [...] But above all, as a real tribute, he was a greater blocker and a greater tackler. [...] He told <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he would rather block or tackle than carry the ball to a touchdown. … If football had a weakness for Hardwick it was that the game was not quite rough enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|Working with Bing Crosby {{proved to}} be {{problematic}} from the start. Between scenes he barely interacted with leading lady Joan Fontaine, on loan from RKO Radio Pictures, who later recalled, [...] "Crosby wasn't very courteous to me ... There was never the usual costar rapport. I was a star at that time, but he treated me like he'd never heard of me." [...] The singer tended to ignore his director as well. According to Fontaine, [...] "It wasn't that he had anything against Mr. Wilder. He just didn't {{pay much attention to}} him. He told <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he had some trouble understanding his funny accent." [...] Worst of all, Crosby tended to alter his dialogue, saying it [...] "as he felt it at the moment," [...] and Wilder was known for insisting his lines be delivered exactly as written. [...] "Bing Crosby operated for himself, not for the group or the film," [...] Wilder recalled. [...] "He was a big star, the biggest, and he thought he knew what was good for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wolfe has {{an aversion}} to {{physical}} contact, even shaking hands. Early in the first novel Archie explains why there is a gong under his bed that will ring upon any intrusion into or near Wolfe's own bedroom: [...] "Wolfe told <b>me</b> <b>once</b> ... <b>that</b> he really had no cowardice in him, he only had an intense distaste for being touched by anyone …" [...] When Jerome Berin, creator of saucisse minuit, repeatedly taps Wolfe on the knee, Archie grins at [...] "Wolfe, who didn't like being touched, concealing his squirm {{for the sake of}} sausages." [...] In Prisoner's Base, Wolfe speaks coldly as he tells the DA and Inspector Cramer that the despised Lieutenant Rowcliff [...] "put a hand on me. ... I will not have a hand put on me, gentlemen. I like no man's hand on me, and one such as Mr. Rowcliff's, unmerited, I will not have." [...] Wolfe's prejudices make it all the more surprising when, in [...] "Cordially Invited to Meet Death", Archie finds Wolfe in the kitchen with a woman who has solved the problem of preparing corned beef: [...] "Standing beside him, closer to him than I had ever seen any woman or girl of any age tolerated, with her hand slipped between his arm and his bulk, was Maryella." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{you came}} to see <b>me</b> at <b>once.</b> <b>That</b> was nice of you. You're the very person I wanted to see.|$|R

6000|$|... "You've caught <b>me</b> <b>once,</b> and <b>that</b> ought'r do," [...] {{said the}} Captain, with unruffled good-nature. [...] "I tell you, Sally, {{your mother was}} the handsomest gal in Harpswell in them days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You told <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> you are {{conscious}} of leaving your body when in trance," [...] I said. [...] "Do {{you always have}} that sensation?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're right, young man, though you've only see'd <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> I know of. But {{most men}} that see me once {{are apt to}} {{remember}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A hundred dollars, I dare say. Dr. Wilkinson's cook told <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he done {{something}} to a lady's eyes, and asked a thousand dollars for it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You!" [...] She {{shuddered and}} clasped him tightly. [...] "Geoffrey, promise <b>me</b> at <b>once</b> <b>that</b> {{you will not}} go near him," [...] she begged. [...] "Promise me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seems 's if ever' cussid thing piles on to <b>me</b> at <b>once.</b> <b>That</b> corn, the road-tax, and hayin' comin' on, {{and now she}} gits {{her back}} up"---- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then own {{two things}} to me; that you did love <b>me</b> <b>once,</b> and <b>that</b> your husband is unkind to you often enough now to make {{you think of the}} time when you cared for me.' ...|$|R
60|$|But {{you told}} <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> ants would fight and plunder each other's nests. And once we saw two hives of bees {{fighting}} in the air, and falling dead by dozens.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Uncle," [...] {{replied the}} child. [...] "But the Sawhorse never says much. He told <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he can't talk and {{think at the}} same time, so he prefers to think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She told <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> if I {{bought a}} certain little dog, {{it would lead}} to my being everlastingly--you know what. She isn't so squeamish as I am, and said it out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know,' said John, 'no {{one could}} expect it of you. Arthur told <b>me</b> at <b>once</b> <b>that</b> you were free from any shadow of blame, {{and no one}} thinks of imputing any.' ...|$|R
60|$|For {{several moments}} {{she refused to}} speak, but after a time she grew more composed. It was clear to <b>me</b> at <b>once</b> <b>that</b> Mrs. Wilbur was {{responsible}} for the girl's passionate grief.|$|R
60|$|When I said this, I fancied I had {{uttered a}} pretty severe thing. Rupert took it so coolly, however, as to satisfy <b>me</b> at <b>once,</b> <b>that</b> he thought {{differently}} on the subject.|$|R
6000|$|... "And Will's dead, {{and out of}} his troubles, I hope," [...] {{continued}} Uncle John, reflectively. [...] "He wrote <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> {{his wife}} had nearly driven him crazy. Perhaps she murdered him in his sleep--eh, Louise?" ...|$|E
60|$|CHR. He told <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he was {{resolved}} {{to go on}} pilgrimage, as we do now; {{but all of a}} sudden he grew acquainted with one Save-self, and then he became a stranger to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you were}} forever vowing {{that you would}} marry a nobleman, my lady. For you said to <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> I should call you so, and ride in the coach with the coroneted panels when I came home on a visit." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next time}} I saw Ellesworth he told <b>me</b> at <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he {{regarded}} Albania as unable {{to stand by}} itself. So I gave him five dollars on the spot and left him.|$|R
6000|$|... "To keep me waiting here, instead Of telling <b>me</b> at <b>once</b> <b>That</b> {{this was}} not the house!" [...] he said. [...] "There, that'll do--be off to bed! Don't gape like that, you dunce!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} her {{engagement}} to Captain Aylmer makes it unnecessary {{for you to}} suppose that she is in want of any pecuniary assistance. You told <b>me</b> <b>once</b> before <b>that</b> you would feel yourself called upon {{to see that she}} wanted nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mocker did. He {{sang and}} sang, for he clearly loves to sing. When he {{finished}} Peter had another question ready. [...] "Somebody told <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> {{down in the}} South you are the best loved of all the birds. Is that so?" ...|$|E
60|$|GO, dumb-born book, Tell {{her that}} sang <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> song of Lawes; Hadst thou but song As thou hast {{subjects}} known, Then were there cause in thee that should condone Even my faults that heavy upon me lie And build her glories their longevity.|$|E
60|$|CHRIS. He told <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he was {{resolved}} {{to go on}} pilgrimage as we do now; {{but all of a}} sudden he grew acquainted with one Save-self, and then he became a stranger to me, for at that time he gave up going on pilgrimage.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} be {{the middle of the night}} when I was awakened by Lawrence Cavendish. He had a candle in his hand, and the {{agitation}} of his face told <b>me</b> at <b>once</b> <b>that</b> something was seriously wrong.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{endorsing}} {{your own}} statement, and it is, at least, considerably easier {{to believe that}} all is for the best when one is prosperous. You have a wealthy husband, and Helen, who wrote <b>me</b> <b>once,</b> testified <b>that</b> he indulged you in--she said every caprice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are teasing me," [...] she said. [...] "Our dear {{one told}} <b>me</b> <b>once</b> to {{remember}} <b>that</b> men serve always something greater than themselves--the idea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the eyes}} of your misguided profession, statesmen and authors and emigrants and other public charges have no Rights of Privacy," [...] said she.

6000|$|... "He told <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> {{he had no}} friends, and no relations, and no name {{save the}} one which he had made for himself," [...] she said. [...] "I don't know whether he meant that Maddison was not his real name, or whether he meant simply his reputation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{you don't}} tell me, Mr. Porter!" [...] exclaimed the lady, in astonishment. [...] "He told <b>me</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> {{he had lived}} with his folks up to {{the time he was}} about ten years old, and that then his parents had died and he had gone to live with an uncle." ...|$|E
6000|$|Not {{till the}} gay crowd {{had been left}} behind did Honor turn to Phoebe, and say gently, 'My dear, if he is gone off in any foolish way, you had better tell <b>me</b> at <b>once,</b> <b>that</b> {{something}} may be done.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now you {{are about}} to wake up and I must leave you for a while. But this I promise you, my most dear, my beloved, my own, that before you fall asleep again for the last time, you shall see <b>me</b> <b>once</b> more, for <b>that</b> is allowed to me.

Also in the space between, {{although}} you do not see me, you will always feel me near, and I shall be with you. So swear to <b>me</b> <b>once</b> more <b>that</b> you will not grieve." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I don't. You are {{so full of}} {{your plans}} and {{proposals}} that you have not yet told me where you have been or what doing these six years. And you ye never written to <b>me</b> <b>once</b> all <b>that</b> time, shabby fellow. I thought you were dead." ...|$|R
