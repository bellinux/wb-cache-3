50|$|One of the {{simplest}} types of machines used on the show is a <b>miter</b> <b>box.</b> This is used to create square and perpendicular saw cuts, or saw cuts at a specific angle.|$|E
5000|$|Original <b>miter</b> <b>box</b> and saw - The {{original}} was a wood 3 sided {{box with}} 90° and 45° slots for guiding a hand saw into cutting miter cuts into the clamped lumber.|$|E
50|$|Every Christmas, Jenniches' father, a {{mechanic}} with a service station garage and correspondence trade school student, {{gave her a}} power tool as a present. When she moved on to college, she brought the tools with her: sanders, circular saws, <b>miter</b> <b>boxes,</b> drills, and other equipment. Atypical for women at the time, it was Jenniches, not her husband, who supplied mechanical tools for the household.|$|R
50|$|This tool uses a 0° reference. This {{means when}} a board is squared {{off the tool}} reads 0°.The angle derived is {{actually}} a complementary angle. For example a 22.5° angle is actually 67.5°. The sum of the angles equals 90 degrees(22.5° +67.5°= 90°). It is obvious from a visual check that where the instruments displays 22.5° is not 22.5°. Many of the new slide <b>miters</b> and <b>miter</b> <b>boxes</b> display both angles. Some of the new calculators have a 0° and a 90° references to do angular calculations. This can create much confusion if the user does not understand this angular calibration.|$|R
