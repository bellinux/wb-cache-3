5|$|On March 18, {{two days}} before the filing deadline, Nixon filed in both the Republican and Democratic {{primaries}} under California's cross-filing system.

Day advanced the $200 (the current equivalent of $2,230) for Nixon's filing fees, later noting that he had great difficulty being reimbursed.|$|E

He spent three days campaigning in Ontario, then moved west to the major cities of the prairie provinces and British Columbia, before returning to his riding for the final days before the June 10 election. Other CCF leaders took charge of campaigning in Quebec and the Maritimes.|$|E

5|$|The United States has {{operated}} under a two-party system {{for most of}} its history. For elective offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the <b>major</b> <b>party</b> nominees for subsequent general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the major parties have been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, and the Republican Party, founded in 1854. Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate—former president Theodore Roosevelt, running as a Progressive in 1912—has won as much as 20% of the popular vote. The President and Vice-president are elected through the Electoral College system.|$|E

50|$|The TPP {{assumes a}} two-party system, i.e. that after {{distribution}} of votes from less successful candidates, the two remaining candidates will be from the two <b>major</b> <b>parties.</b> However, in some electorates {{this is not the}} case. The two-candidate-preferred vote (TCP) is the result after preferences have been distributed, using instant-runoff voting, to the final two candidates, regardless of which party the candidates represent. For electorates where the two candidates are from the <b>major</b> <b>parties,</b> the TCP is also the TPP. For electorates where these two candidates are not both from the <b>major</b> <b>parties,</b> preferences are notionally distributed to the two <b>major</b> <b>parties</b> to determine the TPP. In this case the TPP differs from the TCP, and is not informative. TPP results above seat-level, such as a national or statewide TPP, are also informative only and have no direct effect on the election outcome.|$|R

The Steelers defense shut out the Redskins in the second quarter while the Steelers scored on a field goal to cut the lead in half.

5|$|When the South {{returned}} to firm Democratic {{control at the}} end of the 1870s, Indiana became a key swing state, one of a few that often decided the outcome of national elections. Five Indiana politicians were vice-presidential nominees on the <b>major</b> <b>party</b> tickets in elections held between 1868 and 1916. Benjamin Harrison, an Indianapolis lawyer and former officer in the Union army, was elected the 23rd president of the United States in 1888.|$|E

Five Hoosier politicians were vice-presidential nominees on the <b>major</b> <b>party</b> tickets held between 1868 and 1916, as the nation's political parties vied for the support of the state's electorate. In 1888, at the height of the state's post-war political influence, former Civil War general Benjamin Harrison was elected president, and served in that capacity from 1889 to 1893.|$|E

5|$|Hancock and the Democrats {{expected}} {{to carry the}} Solid South, {{while much of the}} North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a handful of close states, including New York {{and a few of the}} Midwestern states (national elections in that era were largely decided by closely divided states there). Practical differences between the <b>major</b> <b>party</b> candidates were few, and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of waving the bloody shirt: reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that if they held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate soldiers' pensions out of the federal treasury. With fifteen years having passed since the end of the war, and Union generals at the head of all of the major and minor party tickets, the appeal to wartime loyalties was of diminishing value in exciting the voters.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Chotiner {{served as}} {{campaign}} manager for Knowland. Knowland cross-filed and won both <b>major</b> <b>party</b> primaries, virtually assuring his re-election. The strategist also served as Holt's campaign manager in the California 22nd Congressional district Republican primary. Senator Nixon endorsed Holt over State Senator Jack Tenney, and Chotiner asked Nixon to supply him with Tenney's House Un-American Activities Committee file—the state senator had once had communist leanings, though he had long renounced them. Nixon arranged for Chotiner to get the file, {{which was supposed to}} be for Congressional use only, though he apparently made no public use of the file in the campaign. Holt defeated Tenney in the primary, and {{went on to win the}} general election.|$|E

5|$|Jackson won the Democratic primary with 48% of {{the vote}} to Jones's 39%, with the rest {{of the vote}}s {{scattered}} among the other three candidates. The Republicans nominated Thomas Somer. Since the district was overwhelmingly Democratic, Jackson was the favorite for the December 12, 1995 special election. Jackson won the general election with 76% of the vote; his victory was widely anticipated. Upon his victory, Jackson made it known he would be a liberal voice in opposition to Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich. He took office on December 15, 1995. Jackson was perceived as less charismatic than his father and less credentialed than his predecessor, but his family pedigree was expected to help him politically. In August 1996, Somer withdrew from a rematch leaving Jackson with no <b>major</b> <b>party</b> opposition in the November 1996 general election. As a result, Jackson received 94% of the vote in the general election.|$|E
5|$|The American Civil War altered Indiana's society, politics, and economy, {{beginning}} a population shift to central and northern Indiana, {{and contributed to}} a relative decline {{in the southern part}} of the state. Increased wartime manufacturing and industrial growth in Hoosier cities and towns ushered in a new era of economic prosperity. By the end of the war, Indiana had become less rural state than it previously had been. Indiana's votes were closely split between the parties for several decades after the war, making it one of a few key swing states that often decided national elections. Between 1868 and 1916, five Indiana politicians were vice-presidential nominees on the <b>major</b> <b>party</b> tickets. In 1888 Benjamin Harrison, one of the state's former Civil War generals, was elected president of the United States.|$|E

McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that go with it, while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first <b>major</b> <b>party</b> candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976. The Republican's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead, compared to Obama's.|$|E
