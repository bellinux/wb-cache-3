40|$|Yellow Nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.) {{belongs to}} the family of Cyperaceae. It propagates {{exclusively}} with tubers in the ground. Its abundance has strongly increased in Switzerland in the last two decades. Main reasons for this increase are changing land use and production systems, a difficult herbicide control and a low awareness level among the farmers. The actual invasion is enhanced by unintended dislocation of tubers by machines or crops/crop waste, lack of knowledge of infested fields and missing supporting measures. An obligation to announce infested fields and to control Yellow Nutsedge is currently discussed in Switzerland. Such an obligation would help contractors and buyers of crops to reduce unintended dislocation of tubers. Cleaning up infested plots is quickly expensive and complex. <b>Maleic</b> acid <b>hydrazide</b> is actually used for preventing potato tubers to germinate in stock. We tested Fazor (<b>maleic</b> acid <b>hydrazide)</b> and Asulox (asulam) for its efficacy on preventing germination of Yellow Nutsedge tubers. The results of our pot trial in the greenhouse are clear. The expected efficiency was not observed. Furthermore the complexity of problems with this species in agriculture is discussed and some ideas for a control strategy are given in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Higher plant {{cells have}} a long {{tradition}} of use in the studies on environmental mutagenesis in situ, especially in relation to human health risk determination. The studies on the response of plant and human cells to physical and chemical mutagens showed differences in their sensitivity. The differences in the presence of cell components in plants and humans could influence such response. Additionally, the level of the organization of the employed material could influence DNA-damaging effect: leukocytes are isolated cells and plant [...] an intact organism. To preclude these obstacles, the effects of direct treatment of isolated nuclei with genotoxic agents were determined to compare the sensitivity of plant and human cells. In the present study, we have determined the DNA-damaging effects of two chemical mutagens: <b>maleic</b> acid <b>hydrazide</b> (MH) and N-methyl-N-nitroso-urea (MNU) applied to isolated nuclei of both plant and human cells. In order to compare the sensitivity of the nuclei of Nicotiana tabacum var. xanthi and the nuclei of leukocytes, the acellular Comet assay was carried out.

At the end of the study, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, urea and creatinine levels in blood samples were evaluated. Liver and kidney tissues were taken and examined histopathologically. As a result, alone usages of <b>maleic</b> <b>hydrazide</b> caused liver, kidney toxicity. Toxic effects were clearer in liver; however with ethephon, toxicity was more moderate than <b>maleic</b> <b>hydrazide.</b> In combination, glomerulonephritis were seen in the highest doses.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of three growth retardants on the development and yield of dry bean plants. The treatments were control (water), <b>maleic</b> <b>hydrazide</b> (0. 09 g a. i. L- 1), ethyl-trinexapac (0. 5 g a. i. L- 1) and propiconazole (0. 125 g a. i. L- 1). <b>Maleic</b> <b>hydrazide</b> decreased the plant growth rate, resulting in the height reduction (46 %). It also inhibited the twining shoot development, thus controlling the vigor excess of this genotype which has indeterminate growth. On the other hand, plants which were treated with ethyl-trinexapac and propiconazole showed the higher heights (from 25 to 52 %, respectively), indicating that both compounds provide the plant growth. These compounds also increased the number of pods (48 to 52 %) and grains (47 to 102 %), when compared to the control. However, ethyltrinexapac and <b>maleic</b> <b>hydrazide</b> decreased 50 -grain dry mass (41 to 52 %), indicating changes in the photoassimilate partition among plant structures. This change was evidenced by the correlation coefficient of the biomass allocated between the shoots and grains, which was inversely proportional (r=- 60. 57) and highly significant (p= 0. 0002). It is concluded that <b>maleic</b> <b>hydrazide</b> is an efficient growth inhibitor of dry bean plants.

In the second year, <b>maleic</b> <b>hydrazide</b> (2040 mL ha- 1), n-decanol (10720 mL ha- 1) and butralin (2160 mL ha- 1) were utilised in the same variety. Furthermore, a field experiment was performed to assess the susceptibility of different untopped Virginia tobacco varieties to broomrape. The presence of the weed was recorded as the number of the aboveground broomrape plants per m 2 and after harvest dry weight was determined. <b>Maleic</b> <b>hydrazide</b> proved to be highly effective against the parasitic weed when used at the early flowering stage of the crop, reducing by 95 % and 73 %, on average, the number of broomrape plants with respect to the untreated control, respectively in 1997 and 1998. Rimsulfuron, used 55 days after transplanting, had a satisfactory activity against broomrape (reduction of 50 - 70 %). A double treatment with glyphosate caused a reduction of 100 % of broomrape but it significantly depressed tobacco yield. Flumetralin, n-decanol and butralin did not show any control of broomrape.

40|$|<b>Maleic</b> <b>hydrazide</b> (MH), {{which causes}} {{chromosome}} breakage, inhibition of cell division and retardation of plant growth, inhibits nucleic acid synthesis in corn and pea seedling roots. DNA synthesis in corn roots is affected sooner than RNA synthesis; the lag times for inhibition are 4 hr and 8 — 12 hr respectively. MH inhibits nucleic acid synthesis in the root apices most rapidly, while it acts on the subapical portions {{only after a}} much longer delay and sometimes not at all. Likewise, certain fractions of RNA syndiesis are inhibited preferentially (ribosomal RNA), and others are rela-tively unaffected (transfer RNA). Protein synthesis is not affected {{during the early stages}} of MH treatment; however, it too may be reduced after a long exposure. Since 0. 2 % colchicine does not inhibit DNA synthesis in corn roots within 24 hr, it seems unlikely that MH inhibits DNA synthesis indirectly through an effect on cell division. Although MH may also interfere with solute uptake, there is evidence that it is fairly selective in its action, i. e. it does not inhibit respiration or cell expansion in corn roots. Soon after <b>maleic</b> <b>hydrazide</b> (MH) was found to be an effective plant growth retardant, it was shown to inhibit cell division (1, 2). In fact, this inhibition o...|$|E

The {{results of the present}} study let us conclude that: a) MH adsorption on iron oxides, fibrous clays (S and P) and SAz and STx smectites (high layer charge) occurred on external surfaces being the corresponding desorption quite reversible and b) MH adsorption by smectite SWy (low layer charge) occurred as above but also in the interlamellar space (SWy) and its desorption was not reversible.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{combination}} of the micronucleus test with analysis of the activity of the rRNA genes in mutagen-treated Hordeum vulgare (barley) by <b>maleic</b> <b>hydrazide</b> (MH) cells was performed. Simultaneously fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with 25 S rDNA as probes and an analysis of the transcriptional activity of 35 S rRNA genes with silver staining were performed. The results showed that transcriptional activity is always maintained in the micronuclei although they are eliminated during the next cell cycle. The analysis of the transcriptional activity was extended to barley nuclei. MH influenced the fusion of the nucleoli in barley nuclei. The silver staining enabled detection of the nuclear bodies which arose after MH treatment. The results confirmed the usefulness of cytogenetic techniques in the characterization of micronuclei. Similar analyses can be now extended to other abiotic stresses to study the response of plant cells to the environment...|$|E
40|$|In {{the studies}} which {{are carried out}} for obtaining more productive, {{enduring}} and qualified yield several methods are used. One of these methods is fighting with the agricultural pests using pesticides. Herbicides are a group of pesticides. In the present study, the effects of different concentrations (10 - 2 M, 10 - 3 M, 10 - 4 M and 10 - 5 M) of <b>Maleic</b> <b>Hydrazide</b> (MH) which is an herbicide, on Helianthus annuus L. chromosomes undergoing mitotic and meiotic cell division were investigated. Preparates which were made for meiotic division and mitotic division were stained according to Feulgen squash procedure. With 10 - 2 M concentration of MH was not seen mitotic division stage. At the other MH concentrations various meiotic and mitotic division abnormalities were observed. MH concentrations caused a decrease in mitotic index. It is observed that all concentrations of MH caused important abnormalities according to control...|$|E
40|$|The work of Schmidt and Frolik (1951) and of Beard (1955) {{has shown}} that plants of corn (Zea mays L.) grown from seeds treated with {{appropriate}} doses of X-rays or thermal neutrons are greatly reduced in stature and survival in comparison with control plants, and that pronounced increases in chromosomal abnormalities and pollen sterility also result from seed irradiation. It is reasonable to suspect that these morphological and cytological effects might be associated with changes in the metabolism of the plant. Accordingly, a series of experiments has been conducted in which preparations of normal corn seedlings and preparations of dwarfed seedlings grown from irradiated seeds have been compared with respect to several enzyme activities. Measurements have also been made using seedlings which were stunted by the effects of seed treatment with <b>maleic</b> <b>hydrazide,</b> and other seedlings which were stunted by subjection to lowered temperature during growth...|$|E
