40|$|Background. Asthmatic {{children}} and adolescents attending outpatient clinics often {{have a history of}} pneumonia. Whether respiratory symptoms, lung function, and airway inflammation differ in asthmatic patients with and without a history of pneumonia remains controversial. Aims. To compare clinical, lung functional, and inflammatory variables in asthmatic outpatients with and without a history of pneumonia. Methods. In 190 asthmatic outpatients, aged 6 - 18 years, we assessed respiratory symptoms, lung function (flows, volumes, and pulmonary diffusion capacity, DLCO/VA), and atopic-airway inflammation as measured by the fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO). A previous <b>medical</b> and <b>radiological</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of pneumonia was defined as "recurrent pneumonia" if subjects had at least three pneumonia episodes or two episodes within a year. Results. Of the 190 outpatients studied, 38 (20 %) had a history of pneumonia. These patients had more frequent upper-respiratory symptoms, nighttime awakenings in the past 4 weeks, daily use of inhaled corticosteroids, and lower FENO than the 152 asthmatic children without previous pneumonia (FENO: 20. 6 ppb, 95 % CI: 15. 2 - 28. 0 vs. 31. 1 ppb, 95 % CI: 27. 0 - 35. 8; p <. 05). Of the 38 patients with previous pneumonia, 14 had recurrent pneumonia. Despite comparable lung volumes and flows, they also had lower DLCO/VA than asthmatic children with no recurrent pneumonia and asthmatic children without previous pneumonia (DLCO/VA%: 91. 2 +/- 11. 3 vs. 108. 5 +/- 14. 7 vs. 97. 9 +/- 18. 6, p <. 05). Conclusion. Respiratory assessment in asthmatic {{children and}} adolescents with a history of pneumonia, especially recurrent pneumonia, often discloses symptoms needing corticosteroid therapy, and despite normal lung volumes and flows, mild reductions in the variables reflecting gas diffusion and atopic-airway inflammation (DLCO/VA and FENO). Whether these respiratory abnormalities persist in adulthood remains an open question...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The {{purpose of}} this work is to present the design and {{implementation}} of a secure web framework that allows the creation and application of customized metric systems related to diagnoses based on medical images. The image studies are obtained from a Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS) that was developed at the <b>Medical</b> Informatics and <b>Radiological</b> <b>Diagnosis</b> Centre (IMEDIR Research Centre); the web application is designed with the architectonic design pattern Model View Controller (MVC); and we opted for Java Server Pages (JSP), Servlets and Java DataBase Connectivity (JDBC) as implementation technology and deployment platform. Extensible Mark-Up Language (XML) is used to store the information related to {{the composition of the}} metrics, and to save the results of the application of these metrics to each image. The X-Rays were selected at random and proceed from patients at the Orthopedic Surgery Service of the Juan Canalejo Hospital and the Modelo Hospital at A Coruña. The system was validated by a comparative study, in which we used our tool, as well as an already validated software application, to apply the same metric system to a series of 29 digitalized total hip X-Rays. By testing our framework against previously validated methods, we obtain a measurement method that is not only in concordance with preceding software tools, but presents the advantages of secure access through the web, flexibility in the development of new metric systems, and integration with a PACS...|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite {{being so}} {{important}} for {{diagnosis and treatment of}} diseases affecting pediatric patients, there are still gaps in general practitioners as for the interpretation and / or <b>radiological</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of the diseases that most frequently affect these patients. Objective: To diagnose the learning needs of Medicine Doctors in relation to imaging in Cienfuegos. Methods: A descriptive study was conducted at the Paquito González Cueto University Pediatric Hospital and the Cecilio Ruiz de Zárate Polyclinic in Cienfuegos during the years 2008 and 2009. The study included 20 general practitioners. Survey and participant observation were used to determine the knowledge level on interpreting and / or diagnose of respiratory disorders, <b>radiological</b> <b>diagnosis</b> in acute abdominal pain, diagnostic ultrasound advantages in cases of abdominal tumor, imaging test to be performed for diagnosing {{the most common cause of}} urinary tract infection and indication and interpretation of diagnostic ultrasound of soft tissue.

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this article is to compare the {{similarity}} of initial <b>radiological</b> <b>diagnosis</b> and pathological diagnosis between thoracal and lumbar vertebral bodies and the adequacy and the reliability of open and percutaneous biopsies performed via transpedicular approach in the lesions located in vertebral bodies. Materials and Methods: Thirty-three patients who had undergone transpedicular biopsy for vertebral body lesions were retrospectively evaluated. Seventeen patients were diagnosed by percutaneous transpedicular biopsy (11 in the lumbar vertebrae, 6 in the thoracal vertebrae). Sixteen patients were diagnosed by open transpedicular biopsy (9 in the lumbar vertebrae, 7 in the thoracal vertebrae). Results: The similarity ratio between the initial <b>radiological</b> <b>diagnosis</b> and the final pathological diagnosis was 71. 4 % in the open biopsy and was 69. 2 % in the percutaneous biopsy (P > 0. 05). The similarity ratio between the initial <b>radiological</b> <b>diagnosis</b> and the final pathological diagnosis was 66. 7 % in the lumbar region and was 77. 8 % in the thoracal region (P > 0. 05). For percutaneous biopsy group, the similarity ratio was 72. 7 % in the lumbar region and was 66. 7 % in the thoracal region (P > 0. 05). For open biopsy group, the similarity ratio was 62. 5 % in the lumbar region and 83. 3 % in the thoracal region (P > 0. 05). No complication was observed. Conclusion: Specimen adequacy of open biopsy was higher than percutaneous biopsy.
