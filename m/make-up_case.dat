30|$|During the {{interviews}} {{it became clear}} that stakeholders who took part in {{the interviews}} did not have a clear opinion about protection objectives. The protection objectives were of the form “no one is supposed to get hurt”, “we do not allow any interruption to our services” etc. Additionally, during the interviews the stakeholders raised questions showing that they started to consider these issues more seriously and realized that protection objectives need to be firm and measureable. Further, they had a sense for possible <b>make-up</b> in <b>case</b> there was to be loss of a function but the procedures and potential for make-up was not formalized.|$|R

At the time the first weekend of August was open on the NASCAR schedule. Since the race was not being held on a holiday weekend, track officials decided to reserve Sunday as a <b>make-up</b> date in <b>case</b> of rain on Saturday. In 1994, practice and pole qualifying was held on Thursday. Practice, second round qualifying, and [...] "Happy Hour" [...] final practice were scheduled for Friday. In addition, during the first year, a special [...] "pacing" [...] practice was held where the field followed behind the pace car to measure pit road speed.|$|R
25|$|The ECL commissioners and Rube Foster, {{president}} of the NNL, announced that the World Series would be a best-five-of-nine series. The first four games would be played in the home field of the NNL champion on October 1, 2, 3, and 4, with October 5 and 6 available for <b>make-up</b> games in <b>case</b> of rain. Then the series would move to Philadelphia, the home for Hilldale, on October 8, 9, and 10. On Sunday, October 11, play would move to Jersey City, New Jersey because of blue laws in Philadelphia (though the leagues originally planned {{to play the game}} in New York City), and game nine (if necessary) would be played back in Philadelphia on October 12. Because the parks had to be secured in advance, the teams agreed to play exhibition games on October 10 and 11 if the series ended early. The games in Kansas City would take place at Muehlebach Field, the American Association ballpark, and the games in Philadelphia would take place at the Baker Bowl, the National League park, and the game in Jersey City would take place at the International League park.|$|R
40|$|Texas textile mills {{comprise}} an untold part of {{the modern}} South. The bulk of Texas mills were built between 1890 and 1925, a compressed period of expansion {{in contrast to the}} longer developmental pattern of mills {{in the rest of the}} United States. This compression meant that Texas mill owners benefited from knowledge gained from mill expansion elsewhere, and owners ran their mills along the same lines as the dominant southeastern model. Owners veered from the established pattern when conditions warranted. This case study focuses on three mills in Texas that operated both independently and as a corporation for a total of sixty years. One mill in McKinney dominated the economy of a small town and serves as the primary focus of this paper. A second mill in Waco served a diversified economy in the center of the state; and the third mill, built in Dallas was concentrated in a major city in a highly competitive job market. All three of these mills will illuminate the single greatest difference between Texas mills and mills elsewhere, the composition of the labor force. Women did not dominate the mill labor force in Texas nor did children, except in limited <b>cases,</b> <b>make-up</b> a large portion of the workers. Today mill studies of southern mills have found only scattered textile factories with a preponderance of male employees, but in Texas this was the norm. This study demonstrates the unique features of McKinney's textile mill and its similarities to other mills in Texas and in the southeast...|$|R
