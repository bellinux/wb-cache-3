In the paper, a reliable coupled thermo-mechanical three-dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) model for hot rolling of large rings is developed. The relationship between spread and the equivalent shape parameters of the deformation zone is discussed. Variations of spread with relative reduction Rr during hot rolling of titanium alloy large rings with different sizes are analyzed and compared using FE simulation.

The proposed transmission strategy is referred as Multihop Cooperative Trans-mission Chain (MCTC). The MCTC {{is based on the}} relays of the same message by multiple previous terminals along the route and on their linear combination at the receiver to maximize the multihop diversity. Power allocations among transmitting nodes in the route can be obtained according to the average (not instantaneous) node-to-node attenuation using a recursive power assignement that can be employed locally with minimal signalling exchange among nodes. In this paper the MCTC with selection combining strategy at receivers and power assignement that maximize the <b>minimum</b> <b>spread</b> of received power (min-max strategy) is able to better exploit the multihop diversity.

The data period covers three years of observations, January 1994 -December 1996, sampled at half-hourly intervals.

The hypothesis under examination is whether there is any value-added in estimating <b>minimum</b> <b>spread</b> ratios based on intraday data. Three spread ratios are defined: two ratios calculated from daily data and a third one based on intraday data. Evidence tends to indicate that spread ratios calculated from intraday data exhibit a substantially lower variance {{than the other two}} spread ratio speciications. Thus, it is shown that intraday data, in comparison with daily data, allow for lower hedging costs.

Given two networks N_ 1,N_ 2 with n leaves, m nodes, and e edges, the Robinson-Foulds distance measures the number of clusters of descendant leaves that are not shared by N_ 1 and N_ 2. The fastest known algorithm for computing the Robinson-Foulds distance between those networks runs in O(m(m+e)) time. In this paper, we improve the time complexity to O(n(m + e) / log n) for general networks and O(nm/log n) for general networks with bounded degree, and to optimal O(m+e) time for planar phylogenetic networks and boundedlevel phylogenetic networks. We also introduce the natural concept of theminimum spread of a phylogenetic network and show how the running time of our new algorithm depends on this parameter. As an example, we prove that the <b>minimum</b> <b>spread</b> of a level-k phylogenetic network is at most k + 1, which implies that for two level-k phylogenetic networks, our algorithm runs in O((k + 1) (m + e)) time.

An integer mathematical formulation that combines a multicommodity network flow model with a set partionning model is presented. We solve the corresponding linear relaxation using a column generation scheme. Two branching strategies are tested over benchmark instances available in the Internet. Computational results show the effectiveness of our approach. 1. The Integrated Vehicle and Crew Scheduling Problem The vehicle and the crew scheduling problems are important combinatorial optimization problems that arise in the planning process of mass transit companies. Usually, vehicles are scheduled before the crews. During the vehicle scheduling process one has to optimally link timetabled trips producing vehicle blocks, so that each vehicle block forms a feasible schedule for a vehicle. If vehicles are located at different depots, one has to simultaneously construct the vehicle blocks and assign them to the depots. Then, the problem is NP-Hard. On the crew scheduling problem one has {{to ensure that a}} set of crews covers the set of vehicle blocks at minimum cost. Each vehicle block is split into pieces of work, sequences of timetabled trips and deadhead trips, where a change of driver is not allowed. A crew duty is a combination of pieces of work that respects several constraints such as maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>spread,</b> maximum working time without a break, break duration and a maximum number of changeovers. The vehicle blocks characteristics influence the resulting crew duties and the crew duty set may lead to changes on the original vehicle blocks...|$|E

Stellar limb darkening, I(μ = cosθ), is an {{important}} constraint for microlensing, eclipsing binary, planetary transit, and interferometric observations, but is generally treated as a parameterized curve, such as a linear-plus-square-root law. Many analyses assume limb-darkening coefficients computed from model stellar atmospheres. However, previous studies, using I(μ) from plane- parallel models, have found that fits to the flux-normalized curves pass through a fixed point, a common μ location on the stellar disk, for all values of T eff, log g and wavelength. Aims. We study this fixed μ-point to determine {{if it is a}} property of the model stellar atmospheres or a property of the limb-darkening laws. Furthermore, we use this limb-darkening law as a tool to probe properties of stellar atmospheres for comparison to limb- darkening observations. Methods. Intensities computed with plane-parallel and spherically-symmetric Atlas models (characterized by the three fundamental parameters L, M and R) are used to reexamine the existence of the fixed μ-point for the parametrized curves. Results. We find that the intensities from our spherical models do not have a fixed point, although the curves do have a <b>minimum</b> <b>spread</b> at a μ-value similar to the parametrized curves.

The one-way nesting is one in two tiers: first the NCEPs Regional Spectral Model (RSM) runs with an 80 -km grid mesh forced by the ECHAM 3 atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) outputs; then the RSM runs with a finer grid mesh (20 km) forced by the forecasts generated by the RSM- 80. An ensemble of three realizations is done. Lower boundary conditions over the oceans for both ECHAM and RSM model runs are sea surface temperature forecasts over the tropical oceans. Soil moisture is initialized by ECHAMs inputs. The rainfall forecasts generated by the regional model are {{compared with those of}} the AGCM and observations. It is shown that the regional model at 80 -km resolution improves upon the AGCM rainfall forecast, reducing both seasonal bias and root-mean-square error. On the other hand, the RSM- 20 forecasts presented larger errors, with spa-tial patterns that resemble those of local topography. The better forecast of the position and width of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) over the tropical Atlantic by the RSM- 80 model is one of the principal reasons for better-forecast scores of the RSM- 80 relative to the AGCM.

The scaled emission measure profiles look remarkably similar above ∼ 0. 2 times the virial radius (rVT 200). On the other hand a large scatter is observed in the cluster core properties. We fitted a β–model (with and without excising the central part) to all the ROSAT profiles to quantify the structural variations in the cluster population, unraveling a robust quadratic correlation between the core radius and the slope parameter β. We quantified the shape of each gas density profile by the variation with radius of the logarithmic slope, αn. The bi-weight dispersion of αn among the clusters is less than 20 % for any given scaled radii above x = 0. 2. There is a clear <b>minimum</b> <b>spread</b> at x = 0. 3, which {{is related to the}} existence of a correlation between core radius and β. These ensemble properties are insensitive to the exact treatment of a possible central excess when fitting the profiles. On the other hand the scatter in α n is decreased when the radii are scaled to rVT 200. The regularity we found in the gas profiles at x> 0. 2 supports the existence of a universal underlying dark matter profile, as already predicted by theoretical works. It suggests that non gravitational heating is negligible for clusters with temperature above ∼ 3. 5 keV. Our results are consistent with the classical scaling relation between Mass and Temperature (M ∝ T 3 / 2 (1 + z) − 3 / 2). Accordingly the spread in the scaled mass profiles derived from the hydrostatic isothermal β–model is small.

40|$|From {{escalating}} global {{concern over}} the exhaustion of non-renewable energy sources comes an imperative need {{for the use of}} renewable resources. Biomass pyrolysis has emerged as a very promising renewable alternative for fuel and chemical production. Previous work has shown that the most effective biomass pyrolysis processes require a careful control of temperature and residence times, and downer reactors appear to be the best technology to achieve such goals. Ongoing research at the Institute for Chemicals and Fuels from Alternative Resources (ICFAR) has {{led to the development of}} a new downer reactor design for the pyrolysis of biomass feedstock. However, this process requires a gas-solid separator that achieves a <b>minimum</b> <b>spread</b> of the gas residence time distribution – i. e., as near to plug flow as possible. As a result, a novel integrated gas-solid inertial separator has been designed for implementation in the downer reactor. This new separator combines both primary separation and solids stripping within the same device. This is intended to decrease the product vapor residence time and to reduce the severity of vapor overcracking compared to other fast separation methods. The gas-solid separation section of the new device features a uniflow configuration and a vertical, axial entry with either swirl vanes or a deflector cone. In the current study, various geometry configurations and operating conditions were tested for their effect on separation efficiency and pressure drop. A 70 mm-diameter separator was tested under cold flow modeling conditions using silica sand, glass beads or FCC catalyst particles as solid material. The sand, glass beads and FCC particles had Sauter mean diameters of 200 μm, 63 μm and 43 μm, respectively. Air was used in all cases with a gas inlet velocity varying from 0. 95 to 13 m/s and solid loadings ranging between 0. 075 and 19 wt/wt. The separation length was adjusted from 0. 1 to 2 separator diameters. Initial cold flow experiments using silica sand revealed that the separator performance was influenced greatly by the separator geometry. The measured separation efficiency was greater using flow deflector blades (i. e. swirl vanes) than all tested cone deflectors. Solids recovery in excess of 99. 99 % was achieved. Particle collection efficiency decreased steadily as the separation length increased, but was in general not as strongly affected by solid loadings or gas inlet velocity.

40|$|River {{stage and}} {{discharge}} records {{are essential for}} hydrological and hydraulic analyses. While stage is measured directly, discharge value is calculated from measurements of flow velocity, depth and channel cross-section dimensions. The measurements are affected by random and systematic measurement errors and other inaccuracies, such as approximation of velocity distribution and channel geometry with {{a finite number of}} measurements. Such errors lead to the uncertainty in both, the stage and the discharge values, which propagates into the rating curve established from the measurements. The relationship between stage and discharge is not strictly single valued, but takes a looped form due to unsteady flow in rivers. In {{the first part of this}} research, we use a fuzzy set theory based methodology for consideration of different sources of uncertainty in the stage and discharge measurements and their aggregation into a combined uncertainty. The uncertainty in individual measurements of stage and discharge is represented using triangular fuzzy numbers and their spread is determined according to the ISO – 748 guidelines. The extension principle based fuzzy arithmetic is used for the aggregation of various uncertainties into overall stage discharge measurement uncertainty. In the second part of the research we use fuzzy nonlinear regression for the analysis of the uncertainty in the single valued stage – discharge relationship. The methodology is based upon fuzzy extension principle. All input and output variables as well as the coefficients of the stage - discharge relationship are considered as fuzzy numbers. Two different criteria; the <b>minimum</b> <b>spread</b> and the least absolute deviation are used for the evaluation of output fuzziness. The results of the fuzzy regression analysis lead to a definition of lower and upper uncertainty bounds of the stage – discharge relationship and representation of discharge value as a fuzzy number. The third part of this research considers uncertainties in a looped rating curve with an application of the Jones formula. The Jones formula is based on approximate form of unsteady flow equation, which leads to an additional uncertainty. In order to take into account of the uncertainties due to the use of approximate formula and measurement of discharge values, the parameters of the Jones formula are considered fuzzy numbers. This leads to a fuzzified form of Jones formula. Its spread is determined by a multi-objective genetic algorithm. We used a criterion to minimize the spread of the fuzzified Jones formula so that the measurements points are bounded by the lower and upper bound curves. The study therefore considers individual sources of uncertainty from measurements to the single valued and looped rating curves. The study also shows that the fuzzy set theory provides an appropriate methodology for the analysis of the uncertainties in a nonprobabilistic framework. [URL]...|$|E

Critical conditions are set when the <b>minimum</b> <b>spreading</b> velocity of small perturbations $v^*_-$ along the jet (marginal stability velocity) is zero. Here we identify and describe parametrical regions of high technological relevance, where $v^*_- > 0 $ and the jet flow is always supercritical independently of the dispersed liquid flow rate: within these relatively broad regions, the jet does not undergo the usual dripping-jetting transition, so that either the jet can be made arbitrarily thin (yielding droplets of any imaginably small size), or the issued flow rate can be made arbitrarily small. In this work, we provide illustrative analytical studies of asymptotic cases for both negligible and dominant inertia forces. In this latter case, requiring a non-zero jet surface velocity, axisymmetric perturbation waves ``surf'' downstream for all given wave numbers while the liquid bulk can remain static.
