5|$|Although many natural toxins are {{secondary}} metabolites, these poisons {{also include}} peptides and proteins. An {{example of a}} toxic peptide is alpha-amanitin, which is found in relatives of the death cap mushroom. This is a potent enzyme inhibitor, in this case preventing the RNA polymerase II enzyme from transcribing DNA. The algal toxin <b>microcystin</b> is also a peptide and is an inhibitor of protein phosphatases. This toxin can contaminate water supplies after algal blooms and is a known carcinogen that can also cause acute liver hemorrhage and death at higher doses.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{southern}} sea otter's range has continuously expanded from the remnant {{population of about}} 50 individuals in Big Sur since protection in 1911, however from 2007 to 2010, the otter population and its range contracted and since 2010 has made little progress. As of spring 2010, the northern boundary had moved from about Tunitas Creek to a point 2km southeast of Pigeon Point, and {{the southern}} boundary has moved from approximately Coal Oil Point to Gaviota State Park. Recently, a toxin called <b>microcystin,</b> produced by a type of cyanobacteria (Microcystis), seems to be concentrated in the shellfish the otters eat, poisoning them. Cyanobacteria are found in stagnant freshwater enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus from septic tank and agricultural fertilizer runoff, and may be flushed into the ocean when streamflows are high in the rainy season. A record number of sea otter carcasses were found on California's coastline in 2010, with increased shark attacks an increasing component of the mortality. Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) do not consume relatively fat-poor sea otters but shark-bitten carcasses have increased from 8% in the 1980s to 15% in the 1990s and to 30% in 2010 and 2011.|$|E

40|$|Summary. This paper {{presents}} {{research on}} the concentration of <b>microcystins</b> produced by Microcystis aeruginosa (Kützing, UTEX 2667). The relationship between the production of <b>microcystins,</b> the algae growth {{and the content of}} chlorophyll a was investigated at five temperatures (range 20 - 38 °C) and two light intensities – 8000 lx and 2 x 8000 lx.

Neither of the two light intensities impacted the amount of <b>microcystins.</b> HPLC-DAD quality analysis for determination of <b>microcystins</b> in the algal biomass was performed.

The most studied cyanobacterial toxins belong to a family of cyclic heptapeptide hepatotoxins, called <b>microcystins.</b> The <b>microcystins</b> are stable hydrophilic cyclic heptapeptides with a potential to cause cell damage following cellular uptake via organic anion-transporting proteins (OATP).

40|$|Tese dout., Ciências e Tecnologias do Ambiente, Universidade do Algarve, 2009 PAC/UF was {{investigated}} {{to remove the}} cyanobacterium Microcysis aeruginosa and <b>microcystins,</b> focusing on toxins adsorption onto PAC and the combined effect of the water organic and inorganic matrices, the cells removal and lysis by UF, and PAC contribution to membrane fouling control and <b>microcystins</b> removal by PAC/UF. The fine-grade mesoporous PAC presented high capacity and fast kinetics for <b>microcystins</b> adsorption from ultrapure-water. In model and natural waters, NOM size governed microcystins-NOM competition, and inorganics contribution was crucial. Main competitor was NOM of closer size, hindering <b>microcystins</b> adsorption through a pore-blocking mechanism. Ionic strength induced the competition of larger compounds and diminished the competition of similar-sized compounds. Kinetic models confirmed the competing mechanisms proposed based on kinetic and isotherm data. UF ensured absolute removal of M. aeruginosa single-cells, although lysis was detected, particularly with cell ageing. However, AOM-driven <b>microcystins</b> rejection attenuated/avoided the permeate degradation. While not affecting the reversible fouling, PAC improved the permeate quality and membrane irreversible-fouling, minimising the chemical cleaning.
