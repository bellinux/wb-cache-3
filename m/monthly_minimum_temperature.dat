40|$|Utah Freeze Date Prediction {{utilizing}} {{weather station}} climatology and the Climate Forecast System Model Shih-Yu (Simon) Wang, Marty Booth, and Martin Schroeder Utah Climate Center Abstract As {{of the current}} date, there are no long-range forecasts (beyond 7 days) that can predict the first fall or latest spring freeze dates for a given location. The National Climatic Data Center has a statistical product giving a percentage of how many days in a year reach freezing temperatures and the probabilities that indicate {{the chances of a}} shorter/longer freeze-free season for each National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) weather station. The Utah Climate Center contains a database for each COOP weather station that shows the earliest fall and latest spring freeze dates, the average of these dates in either season, and the shortest, average, and longest freeze-free season duration in days. This research utilizes COOP weather station climatology for Utah and the Maurer et. al. gridded data set. The departures of each year’s <b>monthly</b> average <b>minimum</b> <b>temperature</b> around the average first fall and average latest spring freeze dates from the 40 -year average (1971 - 2010) were calculated from both COOP weather stations in Utah and the closest Maurer et. al. grid point. These departures from the 40 -year average were used to correct the average freeze dates calculated from the Maurer et. al. gridded data set. A statistical model was created that correlates the departures of the average <b>monthly</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> for each year (1971 - 2010) around the average freeze date from the 40 -year average of these <b>monthly</b> average <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> of representative COOP weather stations and the average freeze date for each year. The National Centers for Environmental Predication’s (NCEP) Climate Forecast System (CFS) model output <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> were used for grid points covering Utah to find the departures of their average <b>monthly</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> for each year (1971 - 2010) around the average freeze dates from the 40 -year average of the <b>monthly</b> average <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> for each grid point. A statistical model was created for each COOP weather station and the nearest corresponding CFS grid point to show the correlation of the difference of their <b>monthly</b> average <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> with their 40 -year averages. A predictive tool was developed from the combination of these two statistical models to forecast the first fall freeze date for select locations in the state of Utah...|$|R

Low <b>minimum</b> <b>monthly</b> and low <b>minimum</b> daily <b>temperatures</b> 'explain' {{part of the}} observed winter seasonal peak of deaths. However, a sharp change of temperature over 24 hours, either upwards or downwards, is associated with fewer deaths than occured when little or no change of temperature had been experienced.

Artificial neural network systems, fuzzy logic, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference are used in this field. Daily minimum temperature of the meteorology station of the city of Mashhad, in northeast of Iran, in a 42 -year statistical period, 1966 - 2008, has been received from the Iranian meteorological organization. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is used for modeling and forecasting the <b>monthly</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>temperature.</b> To find appropriate inputs, three approaches, i. e. spectral analysis, correlation coefficient, and the knowledge of experts,are used.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dengue fever (DF) {{outbreaks}} often {{arise from}} imported DF cases in Cairns, Australia. Few studies have incorporated imported DF {{cases in the}} estimation {{of the relationship between}} weather variability and incidence of autochthonous DF. The study aimed to examine the impact of weather variability on autochthonous DF infection after accounting for imported DF cases and then to explore the possibility of developing an empirical forecast system. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDS: Data on weather variables, notified DF cases (including those acquired locally and overseas), and population size in Cairns were supplied by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Queensland Health, and Australian Bureau of Statistics. A time-series negative-binomial hurdle model was used to assess the effects of imported DF cases and weather variability on autochthonous DF incidence. Our results showed that monthly autochthonous DF incidences were significantly associated with monthly imported DF cases (Relative Risk (RR) : 1. 52; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 01 - 2. 28), <b>monthly</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>temperature</b> ((o) C) (RR: 2. 28; 95 % CI: 1. 77 - 2. 93), monthly relative humidity (%) (RR: 1. 21; 95 % CI: 1. 06 - 1. 37), monthly rainfall (mm) (RR: 0. 50; 95 % CI: 0. 31 - 0. 81) and monthly standard deviation of daily relative humidity (%) (RR: 1. 27; 95 % CI: 1. 08 - 1. 50). In the zero hurdle component, the occurrence of monthly autochthonous DF cases was significantly associated with <b>monthly</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>temperature</b> (Odds Ratio (OR) : 1. 64; 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 2. 67). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our research suggested that incidences of monthly autochthonous DF were strongly positively associated with monthly imported DF cases, local minimum temperature and inter-month relative humidity variability in Cairns. Moreover, DF outbreak in Cairns was driven by imported DF cases only under favourable seasons and weather conditions in the study...|$|E

40|$|Background:-: In Ethiopia, malaria is {{seasonal}} and unstable, causing frequent epidemics. It usually {{occurs at}} altitudes 2, 000 m above sea level. For transmission of malaria parasite, climatic factors are important determinants {{as well as}} non-climatic factors that can negate climatic influences. Indeed, there is a scarcity {{of information on the}} correlation between climatic variability and malaria transmission risk in Ethiopia in general and in the study area in particular. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the level of correlation between meteorological variables and malaria cases. Methods:-: Time-series analysis was conducted using data on monthly meteorological variables and monthly total malaria in Jimma town, south west Ethiopia, for the period 2000 - 2009. All the data were entered and analyzed using SPSS- 15 database program. Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis were used to asses association between the variables. Results:-: During last ten years (2000 - 2009), a fluctuating trend of malaria transmission was observed with P. vivax becoming predominant species.

In areas with low station density and low interpolaton quality, weather observations were complemented with pseudo-stations from AgMERRA for temperature (Ruane et al., 2015) and CHIRPS (Funk et al., 2015) for precipitation. The results were aggregated into decadal and 30 -yr climatology data. Future climate data was developed by downscaling CMIP 5 projections from 14 General Circulation Models (GCMs) for all four RCPs (RCP 2. 6, 4. 5, 6. 0 and 8. 5; IPCC, 2013) following the method of Ramirez-Villegas and Jarvis (2010).

40|$|Lyons, Robert E. There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that many plant species are flowering earlier {{in recent years}} and that climate change is a contributing factor. These studies have predominantly used field observations as their data source while an increasing number of reports are utilising herbarium specimens. The current research uniquely combined different data sources in the form of herbarium specimens, field observations and dated photographic images to study plant species response to rising temperatures. An analysis of 28 Greater Philadelphia species, native to Pennsylvania and Delaware Piedmont, and 2539 flowering records from 1840 to 2010 indicated that plants are responding to rising minimum monthly temperatures. On average, these species are flowering 16 days earlier over this 170 year period and 2. 7 days earlier per ??C rise in <b>monthly</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>temperature.</b> Monthly minimum temperatures one or two months prior to flowering correlate with flowering time most significantly.
