40|$|The {{first of}} the two related papers analising and {{explaining}} the origin, manifestations and parodoxical features of the quantum potential (QP) from the non-relativistic and relativistic point of view. QP arises in the quantum Hamiltonian, under various procedures of quantization of the systems whose Hamilton functions are the positive-definite quadratic forms in momenta with coefficients depending on the coordinates in (n-dimensional) configurational space (natural systems). Owing to the Riemannian structure thus introduced in the space, the result of quantization is considered as quantum <b>mecanics</b> (QM) of a particle. Contradiction of QP to the Principles of General Covariance and Equivalence is discussed. It is found that actually the historically first Hilbert space based quantization by E. Schrödinger (1926), after revision in the modern framework of QM, also leads to QP in the form that B. DeWitt had been found 26 years later. Efforts to avoid QP or reduce its drawbacks are discussed. The general conclusion is {{that some form of}} QP and a violation of the principles of general relativity induced by it are apparently inevitable in the non-relativistic QM. It is shown also that Feynman quantization singles out two versions of QP, which both determine two bi-scalar propagators which fix two different algorithms of path integral calculation. In the accompanying paper under the same general title and the subtitle "The Relativistic Point of View", relation of the non-relativistic QP to the quantum theory of the scalar field non-minimally coupled to the curved space-time metric is considered.

El projecte pretén ser una base per a qualsevol que es vulgui iniciar en aquest món, per això després de fer una introducció teòrica es pretén demostrar a nivell físic les possibilitats que ofereix ROS, per això es construirà una plataforma. L'objectiu principal del projecte és el d'oferir una introducció clara i entenedora del que significa ROS i com poder configurar les màquines utilitzades des de zero, de tal manera que el lector pugui començar a utilitzar aquesta eina només amb la lectura d'aquest treball, per tant també pretén ser un tutorial de com es pot aplicar ROS en la robòtica mòbil. Com a objectiu secundari, però també important, es planteja el repte de construir la plataforma mòbil per poder exemplificar de manera real el que s'explica en la part teòrica. Com a tema innovador es vol utilitzar un Leap Motion com {{a control}} remot de la plataforma, i no un joystick o simplement el teclat de l'ordinador. Els resultats del projecte demostren que a diferència de les eines clàssiques utilitzades en robòtica, ROS permet desenvolupar robots de manera senzilla i econòmica i que qualsevol amant de la robòtica pugui construir i programar el seu prototip sense la necessitat d'estar en un laboratori o en un recinte industrial, jaque ROS és un sistema de codi obert, sense la necessitat d'haver de pagar per llicències de programari i que qualsevol pot participar en l'evolució i millora d'aquest sistema. També es demostra que es pot controlar una plataforma mòbil sense la interacció amb sistemes <b>mecànics,</b> simplement amb el moviment de la mà, tot gràcies al Leap Motion.

This part of the project is to develop the power supply for the infrastructure created by David Guerrero in his bachelor thesis. The infrastructure is already designed to receive one engine that will give the power necessary for this to be successfully accomplished. For the engine to work we have to have some energy supply in our system, that energy requirement will originate from a variation of renewable energy technologies.

This enables them to achieve almost infinite variety. As a consequence of the evolution of this primary difference, also some other diferentia related to the operational mode of the social information process change, as communication processes take over the lead in contemporary society: while in traditional societies the information process is built upon past events and experience, in communication society it is built upon expectations, which appoint to the future...|$|E

The study utilized two pretest laboratory sessions and one intervention laboratory session. Measurements included setting different stereo configurations with two Phantom v 9. 1 high-speed cameras to: capture video sequences of a MELFA RV- 2 AJ robot executing a simple 3 D path, and additionally capture video sequences of a planar calibration object, being moved by a person, to calibrate each stereo configuration. Significant improvements were made from pretest to intervention laboratory session on minimizing procedures errors and choosing the best camera capture settings. Cameras intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, stereo relations, and disparity-to-depth matrix were better estimated for the last measurements and the comparison between the obtained sets of 3 D points (3 D path) with the robot's 3 D path proved to be similar.

The purpose of this work {{was to investigate the}} labor conditions of the cyclone and provide the information how to optimize it for a good behavior of the gas which is released during the pyrolysis process. In accordance with the main objective, the modelling provided the knowledge of the temperature distribution over the gas inside the cyclone, the range of velocity values, the path lines of the gas and the trajectory of the heavy particles, for different operational conditions. The CFD computer code FLUENT was used for the three dimensional simulation and Gambit as pre-processor to generate the model and create the mesh. Operational data was used to model the cyclone and the gas in the simulations. The RNG k-ε turbulence model together with wall functions and species characterization was adapted for characterization of the gas behaviour and also the simulation was executed in double precision (ddp) mode. The simulations have pointed out that a good range of values to the boundary conditions principally a good value of mass flow can influence in a positive or negative way the behavior of the gas inside the cyclone. In this work was observed that for the conditions which the cyclone is working the efficiency is not good, the mass flow is too small therefore the cyclone should be small.

Therefore, it allows the surgeon to perform smaller incisions and consequently diminish the risk of infection. An investigation regarding {{the reconstruction of the}} liver surface from a sequence of images obtained from an endoscope video has been done by the Vision Institute of TUHH, in cooperation with the Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. The goal {{of this paper is to}} optimize that reconstruction. Previous works in the institute allowed, using matlab functions, to obtain a first reconstruction. Having the matrices of the transformations between cameras and the reconstructed points in 3 D, the goal is to optimize that using a patch based 3 D reconstruction. The method consists of the construction of a patch for every point and trying to find a good normal for the patch. Some tools are used for the optimization like normal cross correlation that is the similarity function used for obtaining the match of the corresponded 2 D windows in different cameras, and a nonlinear optimization method to look for the best normal who gives the best match between the windows. The main objective is to evaluate this method and draw conclusions about its utility and viability: can this method be used for the optimization in the case of the endoscope video of a liver surface.

Castilla y León is a very suitable region for this type of energy because it is a rural community and located in a plateau in which there are sustained winds. It has obtained information about the current situation of the wind energy in this community and with this information, a research has been done to develop the wind energy in Castilla y León and in this way increase the performance of the energy and get more economic costs. The main advantage is that the wind energy is a renewable source which makes it interesting develop of this energy and the major disadvantage is its availability due to this energy depends on the presence of relatively strong winds, for this reason, alternatives have been researched to make it more productive. Taking advantage of that the wind power is a renewable energy source, a project have been done to study the viability of the replacement of the nuclear power in Spain using wind energy. The obtained results confirm the viability of this energy and the necessity to keep developing this energy because today in Castilla y León and Spain this is the main renewable energy and still it could be more developed y make Spain a country more respectful with the environment.

40|$|This project {{involves}} {{the design and}} construction of a fibre cutter {{which can be used}} to chop different types of fibres in order to produce alternative composite materials. Chopped fibre is needed in the production of composite materials for the automotive industry and other sectors. Bulk Moulding Compound (BMC) and Sheet Moulding Compound (SMC) are the most commonly used processes. The process uses chopped glass fibre to produce light composite materials. Currently, the market offers many alternatives to quickly cut glass fibre. However, these methods cannot be used with alternative fibres which are more difficult to handle, so a new fibre cutter is needed to cut alternative fibres and produce new materials which can offer lighter, and more sustainable reinforcement alternatives than glass fibre. The chosen solution has been the modification of an existing fibreglass chopper gun, which was able to cut glass fibre at different lengths with its cutting wheels, but could not cut other types of fibres. After the adaption of the conceptual design to the existing chopper gun, the gun arrangement was able to cut carbon fibre successfully, and is also capable of cutting some types of coated rayon fibre. In order to prove the usefulness of this new design, the chopper gun has been used to cut carbon fibre to produce alternative BMC materials, where, remarkably, that the cutting process just needed 72 seconds to produce 475 grams of chopped carbon fibre. These alternative BMC materials have been tested and compared with conventional glass fibre BMC compounds, demonstrating superior mechanical properties and lower density.

40|$|This Bachelor Degree Project {{seeks to}} model a direct magneto-rheological damper aided by genetic algorithms. The main {{function}} of the suspension system of a vehicle {{is to ensure that}} all tires are in contact with the pavement, that all vibrations created by the contact of the tires are absorbed and that the suspensions assures safety and comfort to the vehicle’s passengers. There are three different set ups for the suspension system of a vehicle, based in its control system. Passive suspension is designed to function at specific fixed conditions. Active suspension adds actuators in the suspension system, instead of the conventional elements, in order to produce a force for any given situation. The possible set up is semi-active suspension that addresses the problem related with the running costs of active suspension and presents an intermediate design between active and passive suspension. The damper in a semi-active suspension is, according to the latest research lines, the magneto-rheological damper. These dampers have a magneto-rheological fluid inside, which contains a 40 % of suspended ferromagnetic particles in a lubricant solution. These particles are able, when induced with an electric current, to polarize forming a magnetic structure that increases their hysteric resistance. With this magneto rheological phenomena the rigidity of the damper is able to vary at a reduce cost. There are two types of models. The direct model, which will be studied in this bachelor project, aims to predict the magneto rheological damper force by feeding a known current to the damper. The inverse model, on the other hand, estimates the current that needs to be fed to apply a determined force. This bachelor degree project implements a direct model to experimental magneto rheological data aided by Genetic Algorithms. Ingeniería <b>Mecánic...</b>|$|E
40|$|A Artroplastia Total do Tornozelo trata-se de um procedimento cirúrgico que procura dar uma alternativa válida para o tratamento de patologias que levem à substituição da articulação natural do tornozelo. No entanto, este tipo de tratamento não é amplamente aceite como em outras articulações tais com o joelho ou o cotovelo. Devido ao facto de o tornozelo ainda apresentar uma constituição biomecânica diferenciada e este procedimento cirúrgico apresenta uma taxa de sucesso {{inferior}} às demais articulações. Assim, este trabalho tem como princípio, o estudo de uma nova proposta para a articulação do tornozelo, de forma a estudar e prever o comportamento da articulação. Os resultados observados no modelo intacto e no modelo implantado, indicam a possibilidade da ocorrência de stress-shielding e possível fratura na zona posterior e anterior do talus, após uma sobrecarga nestas zonas em detrimento da zona medial. Conclui-se, portanto, que as próteses de tornozelo devem ser alvo de estudos de forma a melhor o funcionamento de forma a replicar o movimento natural desta articulação. Total Ankle Arthroplasty it is {{a surgical}} procedure {{that aims to}} be an alternative {{for the treatment of}} disorders leading to replacement of the natural ankle joint. However, this treatment is not widely accepted as other joints such as the knee or elbow. Due {{to the fact that the}} ankle still presents a differentiated biomechanical constitution and this surgical procedure has a success rate lower than other joints. This work has as a principle, the study of a new proposal for the ankle joint to study the behavior of a new concept when subjected to external loads. The results observed in the intact model and the model implemented, indicate the possibility of the occurrence of stress-shielding and possible fracture of the posterior and anterior zone of talus, After an overload in these zones to the detriment of the medial zone [...] It follows therefore that the ankle prosthesis must be subject to studies to improve designs which better able to replicate the natural motion of the knee joint.

The project is focused on a competition motorbike suitable for the Moto 3 World Championship. We start off by studying {{the evolution of the}} swing-arms and suspension systems that has taken place over the years in the context of motorbikes. The most common and most used swing-arms and suspension systems nowadays and their performance are also studied. In this introduction we expose some suggestions of a swing-arm design, out of these suggestions one is chosen over the others. This chosen design is then developed and upgraded for it to satisfy the requirements of our motorbike. Then a similar process is used for the suspension system where different designs are discussed choosing only one of them. The chosen suspension system is optimized for it to satisfy the requirements imposed by the motorbike. Last, the auxiliary elements that will be needed are calculated and chosen to fit the final design. Ingeniería Técnica en <b>Mecánic...</b>|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} a detailed investigation and {{outcome of the}} research done by Team Thales on “knowledge retention”. The Thales Group has asked to examine the process of capturing valuable knowledge from their employees and provide a way to share it within the company's network of employees. In order to do this, the project team brainstormed and conducted individual studies {{to have a better}} understanding of the problem and its root cause. Moreover, an interim solution was first derived, and after series of meeting sections took place with the project tutor and the representatives from the Thales Group, the team was able to come up with a final solution. A competitor analysis was made to analyse existing solutions and identify their strengths and weaknesses in comparison to the solution the team arrived at. The interim solution is a mind map that serves as a blueprint and guide on issues the team had to pay attention to when considering a solution to the problem. The team identified six areas of interest: Business Critical, Communication, Environment, Risk Management, Security and Sharing. The final solution tackles the problem of knowledge acquisition and sharing through a structural and a technological approach, with special attention to user friendliness and adaptability so as not to increase the burden of the employees in form of additional workload. The structural solution includes a gap period while the technological solution is a tool called "Thales Knowledge Acquisition and Sharing Software" (TKASS). TKASS is a powerful software with a sense of inclusion and all-age group adaptation. It provides features like a secured file sharing tool called "THASTO", User Profile, the Knowledge Community where employees can ask questions and share “lessons learnt” and finally an intelligent wiki, which is smart enough to gather relevant connections and learns to help employees compose a well-detailed report. More about the problem, the studies done and how the team arrived at a final solution are discussed further in the later sections of this report.
