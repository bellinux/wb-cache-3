5|$|Lambertia formosa {{is readily}} grown in {{cultivation}} given a sunny position and fair drainage, though it tolerates {{a range of}} soils and some shade. Its flowers attract birds, especially important as this can provide a source of food year-round. The plant responds well to pruning. Seeds germinate within 25 to 60 days of sowing, and firm young growth <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> cutting material for propagation. Fertilisers generally are not needed, but slow release low-phosphorus fertilisers are tolerated. The species is frost-hardy and grows in temperate to subtropical climates.|$|E
25|$|A group date, {{in which}} the {{bachelor}} {{and a group of}} women participate in an activity. Sometimes the activity {{takes the form of a}} competition, the winner or winners spending more time with the bachelor. The bachelor typically presents a rose to the woman who <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> impression during the group date.|$|E
25|$|Taro (Colocasia esculenta): A {{popular and}} ancient plant {{that has been}} {{harvested}} for at least 30,000 years by indigenous people in New Guinea. There are hundreds of varieties of taro, and the corm of the wetland variety <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> poi, as well as taro starch or flour. The dry-land variety has a crispy texture and used for making taro chips. The smaller American variety is used for stewed dishes.|$|E

25|$|The Y-12 {{plant in}} Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where mass spectrometers called calutrons had enriched uranium for the Manhattan Project, was {{redesigned}} to make secondaries. Fissile U-235 <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> spark plugs because its critical mass is larger, {{especially in the}} cylindrical shape of early thermonuclear secondaries. Early experiments used the two fissile materials in combination, as composite Pu-Oy pits and spark plugs, but for mass production, {{it was easier to}} let the factories specialize: plutonium pits in primaries, uranium spark plugs and pushers in secondaries.|$|E
25|$|Malaitan {{hydrology}} includes {{thousands of}} small springs, rivulets, and streams, characteristic of a young drainage pattern. At higher altitudes waterfalls are common, and in some places canyons have been cut through the limestone. Nearer the coasts, rivers are slower and deeper, and form mangrove swamps of brackish water, along with alluvial deposits of gravel, sand, or mud. The coastal plain is very narrow. Inland soils are of three types, wet black, dry black, and red. The wet black soil, too poorly drained for most horticulture except taro, is found in valleys or {{at the foot of}} slopes. Dry black <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> gardening sites. The red soil, probably laterite, does not absorb runoff and forms a hard crust, and is preferred for settlement sites.|$|E

500|$|Khan {{received}} further {{success in}} 2008, {{starring in the}} Abbas-Mustan thriller Race with an ensemble cast including Anil Kapoor, Akshaye Khanna, Bipasha Basu, Katrina Kaif and Sameera Reddy. The feature was loosely adapted from the 1998 American film Goodbye Lover, {{and became one of}} the biggest box office hits, earning [...] worldwide. CNN-IBN's Rajeev Masand found Khan to be a standout among the ensemble, adding that he has [...] "the least dialogue but the one who <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> impression". This was followed by three projects produced by Yash Raj Films: the action-thriller Tashan, the fantasy-drama Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic, and the animated film Roadside Romeo, all of which were not successful.|$|E
500|$|Three more 2001 {{releases}} featured Zinta, including Abbas-Mustan's romantic drama Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, {{which was}} released after a one-year delay {{due to the}} trial of producer Bharat Shah. This film {{was one of the}} first Bollywood films to address the controversial issue of surrogate childbirth. Zinta played the role of Madhubala, a golden-hearted prostitute hired as a surrogate mother. Initially reluctant to play the part, she eventually accepted it at the directors' persuasion and, to prepare for it, visited several bars and nightclubs at Mumbai's red-light areas to study the lingo and mannerisms of sex-workers. She received a second Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Filmfare Awards for her performance, of which reviewer Sukanya Verma wrote, [...] "Preity Zinta, who clearly has the meatiest part of all, <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of it. Her transformation from the cocky and unabashed prostitute to a sensitive and warm person is amazingly believable." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 she {{appeared}} in Arjun Pandit alongside Sunny Deol, the film was a success {{at the box office}} and Chawla received favorable reviews for her role with shades of grey in the film, a critic while reviewing the film for planet Bollywood wrote [...] "Juhi is great during the climax as already mentioned, her character has several shades, in the first half she is bubbly and fun-loving and later on her character takes a U-turn, her performance shows her versatility and she clearly overshadows the hero in the film, she gives a great performance. Juhi <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of what she is given." [...] The same year she also starred opposite Sanjay Dutt in the adventure film Safari, the film was a flop.

2500|$|Many taquerías in the Mission {{and greater}} San Francisco Bay Area {{specialize}} in Mission burritos. It is typically a large flour tortilla that is wrapped and folded around {{a variety of}} ingredients, served {{in a piece of}} aluminum foil. A food critic for the San Francisco Chronicle counted hundreds of taquerias in the Bay Area, and noted that the question of which taqueria <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> burrito can [...] "encourage fierce loyalty and ferocious debate". New York-based writer Calvin Trillin said that the burrito in San Francisco [...] "has been refined and embellished {{in much the same way}} that the pizza has been refined and embellished in Chicago." [...] Since its commercial availability began in the 1960s, the style has spread widely throughout the United States and Canada.|$|E
2500|$|By May 1996, Sound on Sound was {{reporting}} that {{the popularity of the}} 808 had started to decline, with the rarer TR-909 taking its place as [...] "the dance floor drum machine to use." [...] This is thought to have arisen for a number of reasons: the 909 gives more control over the drum sounds, has better programming and includes MIDI as standard. Sound on Sound reported that the 909 was selling for between £900 and £1100 and noted that the 808 was still collectible, but maximum prices had peaked at about £700 to £800. Such prices have held in the 12 years since the article was published, this can be evidenced by a quick search on eBay. Despite this fascination with retro music technology, according to Derrick May [...] "there is no recipe, there is no keyboard or drum machine which <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> techno, {{or whatever you want to}} call it. There never has been. It was down to the preferences of a few guys. The 808 was our preference. We were using Yamaha drum machines, different percussion machines, whatever." ...|$|E
