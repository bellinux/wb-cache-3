5|$|In William Urban's summary, {{almost all}} {{accounts}} of the battle <b>made</b> <b>before</b> the 1960s were more influenced by romantic legends and nationalistic propaganda than by fact.

5|$|A {{version of}} the game for the Sega Master System and Game Gear was {{developed}} by Aspect. Though based on the original game of the same name, it is a distinct game, with different level designs and a different plot, and this version, unlike the 16-bit release, {{does not have the}} spin dash, which led it to being thought to be <b>made</b> <b>before</b> the Sega Genesis version.|$|E
5|$|Asia Raya {{contributors}} were Japanese or native, {{with the}} latter more active; works by two foreign authors, Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi, were also published in translation. The single most-published writer in Asia Raya was Rosihan Anwar, a recent senior high school graduate, who published seven poems and nine short stories while working for the newspaper. Andjar Asmara, a former film director, published the most serials; both of his serials were based on films he had <b>made</b> <b>before</b> the occupation.|$|E

5|$|Basque {{people were}} the first to hunt right whales commercially, {{beginning}} as early as the 11th century in the Bay of Biscay. They initially sought oil, but as meat preservation technology improved, the animal was also used for food. Basque whalers reached eastern Canada by 1530 and the shores of Todos os Santos Bay (in Bahia, Brazil) by 1602. The last Basque voyages were <b>made</b> <b>before</b> the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). All attempts to revive the trade after the war failed. Basque shore whaling continued sporadically into the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Items of {{jewellery}} <b>made</b> <b>before</b> {{the death}} of Queen Victoria in 1901 are regarded as heirlooms owned by the Queen in right of the Crown and pass from one monarch to the next in perpetuity. Objects made later, including official gifts, can also be added {{to that part of}} the Royal Collection at the sole discretion of the monarch. It is not possible to say how much the collection is worth because the jewels have a rich and unique history, and they will likely never be sold on the open market.|$|E
5|$|Melvin {{therefore}} {{resorted to}} arresting suspects– including juveniles, {{some of them}} regarded as vulnerable– and holding them for days without access to lawyers. Of the 359 people arrested {{in connection with the}} inquiry in 1985 and 1986, just 94 were interviewed {{in the presence of a}} lawyer. Many of the confessions that resulted, whether directly about the murder, or about having taken part in the rioting, were <b>made</b> <b>before</b> the lawyer was given access to the interviewee.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} to England, Coutances was given custody of the abbeys of Wilton and Ramsey, which were being held by King Henry pending the {{election}} of new abbots. He thus acquired the right to collect the abbeys' revenues {{in the name of}} the king, who had the regalian rights to that income. In 1180 Henry sent Coutances to France on another diplomatic mission. In February 1182 Coutances witnessed King Henry II's will, <b>made</b> <b>before</b> the king travelled to Normandy.|$|E

5|$|Portland {{has had two}} {{replicas of}} Philadelphia's {{original}} Liberty Bell. The first replica was purchased in 1962 for $8,000. It arrived in Portland in June 1963, with a damaged base and beam since the sculpture had slipped off its supports. Repairs were <b>made</b> <b>before</b> the replica was paraded through the city on a flatbed truck, then put into storage until Independence Day. The bell was publicly rung {{for the first time}} during holiday celebrations and installed in City Hall's rotunda on May 5, 1964.|$|E

5|$|The {{first draft}} of the game placed a figurehead similar to Kreia {{as the leader of}} a matriarchs ruling 's world, which the player was sent to free. This draft was <b>made</b> <b>before</b> Obsidian had played the , due to LucasArts needing Obsidian to sign a {{contract}} before giving them copies of Knights of the Old Republic, and after they had played it the draft was discarded. However, some of Kreia's characteristics were salvaged, though little else was.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{staff at}} the U.S. animation studio, Film Roman, draws storyboards, designs new characters, backgrounds, props and draws character and background layouts, which in turn become animatics to be screened for the writers at Gracie Films for any changes to be <b>made</b> <b>before</b> the work is shipped overseas. The overseas studios then draw the inbetweens, ink and paint, and render the animation to tape before it is shipped back to the United States to be delivered to Fox {{three to four months}} later.|$|E
5|$|Two {{distinct}} overprints were <b>made,</b> <b>before</b> {{and after}} the formal independence of the state on 6 December 1922. The Provisional Government of Ireland (Rialtas Sealadach na hÉireann) overprints were initially issued on 17 February 1922, with eight low-value and three high-value stamps overprinted by Dollard and four by Thom. This overprint is composed of the four words Rialtas Sealadach na hÉireann and the numeral date 1922 arranged in five lines of seriffed text. The unoverprinted stamps remained valid for postage in Ireland until 31 March 1922.|$|E
