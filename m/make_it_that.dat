5|$|The {{tawny owl}} {{is a member}} of the wood-owl genus Strix, part of the typical owl family Strigidae, which {{contains}} all species of owl other than the barn owls. Within its genus, the tawny owl's closest relatives are Hume's owl, Strix butleri, (formerly considered to be conspecific), the Himalayan owl, Strix nivicolum, (sometimes considered conspecific), its larger northern neighbour, the Ural owl, S. uralensis, and the North American barred owl, S. varia. The Early–Middle Pleistocene Strix intermedia is sometimes considered a paleosubspecies of the tawny owl, which would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> species' immediate ancestor.|$|E
5|$|General Carleton {{arrived in}} Trois-Rivières {{late in the}} action. A {{detachment}} of British forces led by Major Grant had taken control of a bridge over the Rivière-du-Loup, a critical crossing for the Americans retreating along {{the north shore of}} the Saint Lawrence. Carleton ordered Grant to withdraw, allowing most of the Americans to escape, either because {{he did not want to}} deal with large numbers of prisoners or because he wanted to demoralize the Americans further. A significant number of Americans did not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> far, and were captured. These included General Thompson and seventeen of his officers. It was not until June 13 that the British finished rounding up the stragglers. In all, 236 captives were taken. Brendan Morrissey says that about 30 Americans were killed in the battle, while Howard Peckham gives a figure of 50 Americans killed.|$|E
25|$|The pros {{were given}} a points system just like the amateurs. A first in the Main will earn a AA pro 240 points second 200, 160 for third and so on until six place would be worth 40 points. As in the amateur {{divisions}} the pros would earn rider points. The top ten pros would be determined by this points ranking. Additionally the best ten finishes at the nationals plus the Grand Nationals (making it eleven races) would count toward the pros eligibility to contend for the Pro #1 plate. Purse money would be distributed not only among the racers who made the main, but also those who got to the semis or even didn't <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> far, so practically every one got something for racing, {{even if it was}} just a one hundred percent payback on their entrance fee.|$|E

25|$|At 1430 Vorse led {{the first}} CAP group to {{intercept}} bombers and fighter escorts {{making their way}} towards the U.S. carriers. Japanese Zero fighters effectively prevented Vorse and the men of his group—Register, Loesch and Sumrall—from engaging the incoming dive bombers, which by day's end would score three hits on Enterprise. The enemy fighters paid dearly for their actions, however: Vorse, Register and Sumrall each downed one {{by the end of}} the scrap. Out of both ammunition and gas by CAP's end, the men of Vorse's division were forced to land and refuel aboard Saratoga, with the notable exception of Vorse himself who could not even <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> far and plunked his bird down in the water off Saratogas stern. For the remainder of the day, Japanese air power was directed almost singly on Enterprise, with VF-6 scrambling to knock as many bombers off course and out of the sky as possible. By the end of action on 24 August, the fighter squadron claimed 13 Aichi 99 dive bombers and 10 Nagoya Zeros, among other miscellaneous aircraft.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1181, Raynald of Châtillon raided {{south into}} Arabia, in the {{direction}} of Medina, although he did not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> far. It was probably around this time that Raynald also attacked a Muslim caravan. The kingdom had a truce with Saladin at the time, and Raynald's actions have been seen as an independent act of brigandage; it is possible {{that he was trying to}} prevent Saladin from moving his forces north to take control of Aleppo, which would have strengthened Saladin's position. In response, Saladin attacked the kingdom in 1182, but was defeated at Belvoir Castle. King Baldwin, although quite ill, was still able to command the army in person. Saladin attempted to besiege Beirut from land and sea, and Baldwin raided Damascene territory, but neither side did significant damage. In December 1182, Raynald launched a naval expedition on the Red Sea, which made it as far south as Rabigh. The expedition was defeated and two of Raynald's men were actually taken to Mecca to be executed in public. Like his earlier raids, Raynald's expedition is usually seen as selfish and ultimately fatal for Jerusalem, but according to Bernard Hamilton it was actually shrewd strategy, meant to damage Saladin's prestige and reputation.|$|E
500|$|In 1962, {{the book}} was {{published}} in Britain. Siriol Hugh-Jones wrote for The Times Literary Supplement, [...] "The Phantom Tollbooth is something every adult seems sure will turn into a modern Alice... The obvious {{guess is that the}} appeal of this sort of writing is directed towards just the sort of adults who derive a perfectly grown-up pleasure from regularly rereading the Alices. As one might expect, it is illustrated by every grown-up's favourite child-like pictures with the built-in sad sophistication, the work of Jules Feiffer." [...] Jennifer Bourdillon reviewed it for The Listener, [...] "This is the story of an imaginary journey, a sort of Pilgrim's Progress of a little boy in his car... One would hardly have thought from the sound of this that it would have so magnetic an appeal, but the brilliant verbal humour and the weird and wonderful characters (the Dodecahedron. the Watchdog, Faintly Macabre) <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> rare delight, a book which parents and children can share." [...] It reached Australia in 1963; The Canberra Times reviewer, J.E.B., deemed it memorable, causing readers to quote from it and leaf through its pages again.|$|E

500|$|In June 2014, Christopher Lennertz, who {{composed}} {{the music for}} the Agent Carter One-Shot, talked about potentially working on the series, saying, D'Esposito [...] "told me last summer at Comic-Con {{that there was a}} possibility this was going to become a series. And he said that {{if he was going to}} be involved, he wanted me to be involved, too." [...] In September 2014, Lennertz officially signed on to compose for the series. Lennertz combined all the different style elements of the show in the music, such as mixing jazz and period elements, with orchestra and electronic elements. Lennertz said, the music is [...] "always done from a sense of being sort of in control and savvy and clever, rather than just being strong or just having a superpower or sort of being so much further along than anybody else physically. Part of it was just trying to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> she's just smarter than everybody else. She's got such command over so many of these situations, and that was the most important thing was to give her that personality." [...] A soundtrack album for the first season was released on iTunes on December 11, 2015, and the single [...] "Whatcha Gonna Do (It's Up to You)" [...] from the second season was released on March 18, 2016.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} that appeared in Cinefantastique, Argento noted that the film was intended as near-science fiction, taking place [...] "about five or more years in the future... Tenebrae occurs in a world inhabited by fewer people {{with the result that}} the remainder are wealthier and less crowded. Something has happened to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way but no one remembers, or wants to remember... It isn't exactly my Blade Runner, of course, but nevertheless a step into the world of tomorrow. If you watch the film with this perspective in mind, it will become very apparent." [...] Argento later insisted that the film was set in an imaginary city, fifteen years in the future, and that the disaster the city's inhabitants were striving to forget was an atomic bomb blast. Despite Argento's claim, Maitland McDonagh observed that this vaguely science-fictional concept [...] "isn't apparent at all" [...] and that no critics at the time noted the underlying futuristic theme in their reviews of the theatrical release of the film. The film critic and author Kim Newman countered that in avoiding a more recognisable Rome in favour of suburbia, Argento had succeeded in giving some parts of the film an almost futuristic sheen. Argento biographer Alan Jones agreed that Argento's intention did come across in these scenes, and Newman cites the on-screen use a videophone as an attempt by Argento to place Tenebrae in the near future.|$|E
500|$|The pop rock album {{opens with}} the curtain call, {{strengthening}} {{the impression of}} a live recording rather than a studio album. Carlile performed [...] "Shadow on the Wall", [...] "Turpentine", and [...] "The Story", which had appeared on Carlile's second studio album The Story (2007). [...] "Looking Out", [...] "Before It Breaks", [...] "I Will", [...] "Dreams", and [...] "Pride and Joy" [...] had all appeared on Give Up the Ghost. Believing in the cultivation of standards, Carlile included six cover versions in the set list, three of which appear on the album. [...] "Sixty Years On", originally written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, was arranged by Paul Buckmaster. Carlile, a fan of the [...] "dark" [...] string arrangements that appear on John's album Tumbleweed Connection (1970), contacted Buckmaster on the advice of her manager. Carlile first heard the Hanseroth brothers singing Paul Simon's [...] "The Sound of Silence" [...] in 2009 and asked them to perform it during the set. She does not contribute vocals to the version that appears on the album. Carlile's cover of Leonard Cohen's [...] "Hallelujah", also arranged by Buckmaster, is followed by a hidden track: a cover of Alphaville's [...] "Forever Young". Carlile said the following of Cohen's song: [...] "Hallelujah" [...] {{is going to be a}} standard that our grandkids, our great-great grandkids will learn to sing in church. It's one of those really, really special songs. The thing that's going to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>that,</b> besides that it's so great, is that everyone knows about it because hundreds of songwriters have been moved by that song and have covered it. And that's just something really important that we do in every generation.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "We Need To Talk About Kevin", Dean escapes Purgatory {{with the}} help of the vampire Benny, but Castiel is not with him. He later tells Sam that things got hairy near the end and that Castiel didn't <b>make</b> <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> he [...] "let go". While Dean doesn't elaborate, he is clearly {{affected}} by this. In a flashback scene, Dean is shown looking for Castiel in Purgatory, interrogating a vampire for his location. As a result, he meets Benny and only agrees to Benny's deal to get out if they find Castiel first and help him escape too. Castiel appears in flashbacks in the following episode, where he reveals that he fled Dean to keep him safe from the Leviathans and other monsters that are angry at Castiel, but Dean refuses to leave Purgatory without Castiel. When talking with another angel at an auction for the second Word of God tablet, Dean again states that Castiel did not make it out of Purgatory. He later escapes with the aid of an army of angels sent to rescue him – having initially remained behind as penance for his actions to stop a duo of Leviathans that were trying to attack Dean and Benny as they left Purgatory – but the other angels not only erase his memory that they were responsible for his escape, but also erase his memory of their subsequent 'check-ins' to discuss the Winchesters' actions, with Castiel forced to tell them about the Winchesters' progress in the search for the tablet. Apparently back to full power, Castiel helps the Winchesters save Kevin from Crowley – who has been abducting future Prophets to try to find another means of reading the Word of God tablet – and destroy the tablet to prevent Crowley using it, retaining half of the tablet while Crowley flees with the other half. Afterwards, in [...] "Hunteri Heroici", Castiel cuts off his ability to listen into the other angels and decides to become a full-time hunter to avoid facing the other angels about what he has done. Castiel proves instrumental in solving the case, using his abilities to enter the mind of a man with reality warping powers, allowing Sam to bring him back to reality with a speech about not running from it. Later, at the request of the man, Fred, Castiel strips him of his powers so he is no longer a danger to anyone though it leaves him mentally damaged. Castiel, having listened to Sam's speech about running from reality as well as Fred, decides to return to Heaven to try to make up for what he did, but is forbidden by Naomi, the angel who ordered his rescue. Instead, Castiel stays to watch out for Fred for a while, but accepts that he can no longer run from what he has done.|$|E

You know what, people get what they deserve, they really do. I might've poisoned someone by accident, but he never should've talked to me like that. You just don't do that. Anyway, people get what they deserve, and I think a lot of them have what's coming to them, and I'm not sure I'm done yet." [...] About Sheila's personality, Brown said: [...] "Sheila's just evil. There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [...] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to. When being nice and being diplomatic and when being all those things don't work any longer, she snaps." [...] On Sheila's relationship with Stephanie Forrester, Brown said: [...] "Stephanie made my life miserable. So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that. And Stephanie couldn't stop me." [...] Brown also added that, [...] "To be a good villain, you have to make the character real for you." ...|$|E
