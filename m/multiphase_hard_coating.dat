40|$|This {{research}} has experimentally investigated the influence on vibration characteristics of thin cantilever cylindrical shell (TCS) with <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> under cantilever boundary condition. Firstly, the theoretical model of TCS with <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> is established to calculate its natural frequencies and modal shapes {{so as to}} roughly understand vibration characteristic of TCS when it is <b>coated</b> with <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> material. Then, by considering its nonlinear stiffness and damping influences, an experiment system is established to accurately measure vibration parameters of the shell, and the corresponding test methods and identification techniques are also proposed. Finally, {{based on the measured}} data, the influences on natural frequencies, modal shapes, damping ratios, and vibration responses of TCS with <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> are analyzed and discussed in detail. It can be found that <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> can {{play an important role in}} vibration reduction of TCS, and for the most modes of TCS, <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> will result in the decrease of natural frequencies, but the decreased level is not very big, and its damping effects on the higher frequency range of the shell are weak and ineffective. Therefore, in order to make better use of this coating material, we must carefully choose the concerned antivibration frequency range of the shell; otherwise it may lead to some negative effects...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{nonlinear}} vibration {{mechanism of}} <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> thin plate based on macroscopic vibration theory and proposes finite element iteration method (FEIM) to theoretically calculate its nature frequency and vibration response. First of all, strain dependent mechanical property of <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> is briefly introduced and polynomial {{method is adopted}} to characterize the storage and loss modulus of coating material. Then, the principle formulas of inherent and dynamic response characteristics of the <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> composite plate are derived.

Finally, a composite plate coated with MgO + Al 2 O 3 is taken as a study object and both nonlinear vibration test and analysis are conducted on the plate specimen with considering strain dependent mechanical parameters of <b>hard</b> <b>coating.</b> Through comparing the resulting frequency and response results, the practicability and reliability of FEIM have been verified and the corresponding analysis results can provide an important reference for further study on nonlinear vibration mechanism of <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> composite structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{parameters of}} <b>hard</b> <b>coating,</b> such as storage modulus and loss factor, {{are affected by}} preparation technology significantly and have the strain dependent characteristic. So the effective identification of these mechanical parameters becomes a challenge task. In this study, a hard-coating cantilever thin plate under base excitation was taken as the research object, and an inverse method was developed to identify these mechanical parameters. Firstly, the principles of identifying storage modulus and loss factor of <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> were presented according to the inverse method. Then, from the need of parameters identification, the analytical model and calculation formula of equivalent strain for the hard-coating composite plate were derived. Next, also for parameter identification, the vibration experiments about the cantilever plate coated with NiCoCrAlY+ yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> were performed. Finally, the mechanical parameters of NiCoCrAlY+YSZ <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> with strain dependent characteristic were identified by the proposed method. The identification {{results show that the}} change rules of storage modulus and loss factor of <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> with the strain amplitude are almost consistent with the results listed in the other similar references. However, the identification results herein can more directly serve for the dynamic modeling of hard-coating plate-shape composite structure...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{material}} nonlinearity of <b>hard</b> <b>coating,</b> the coated structure produces the nonlinear dynamical behaviors of variable stiffness and damping, which make the modeling of hard-coating composite structure become a challenging task. In this study, the polynomial was adopted to characterize this material nonlinearity and an analytical modeling method was developed for the hard-coating composite plate. Firstly, to relate the hard-coating material parameters obtained by test and the analytical model, the expression of equivalent strain of composite plate was derived. Then, the analytical model of hard-coating composite plate was created by energy method considering {{the material}} nonlinearity of <b>hard</b> <b>coating.</b> Next, using the Newton-Raphson method to solve the vibration response and resonant frequencies of composite plate and a specific calculation procedure was also proposed. Finally, a cantilever plate coated with MgO + Al 2 O 3 <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> was chosen as study case; the vibration response and resonant frequencies of composite plate were calculated using the proposed method. The calculation results were compared with the experiment and general linear calculation, and the correctness of the created model was verified.

40|$|Abstract. PVD <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> is a {{well-known}} surface treatment technology for steels to improve wear resistance and, to some extent, corrosion resistance. In principle, <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> {{can be carried out}} for Al alloys, but due to the natural oxide layer and the insufficient load-bearing capacity of the soft base material, the application of this technology for wear protection of components is not regarded as being particularly promising. The research activities described in this paper focused on electron beam (EB) surface alloying with a Co-based additive, and the influence of two different hardness levels (270 HV 0. 1 and 390 HV 0. 1) on the improvement of the local load-bearing capacity of Al alloys with thin PVD hard coatings. A further focus of this research was on the material-specific aspects of the coating deposition. Compared to steels, the <b>hard</b> <b>coated</b> surface of Al alloys is rougher and the measured adhesion of the coating is significantly lower. For this purpose, different technological PVD parameters (e. g. Ti interlayer, deposition temperature, and time) were adapted to optimize the coating properties â€“ especially adhesion. The paper deals with comparative studies of single (PVD <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> of Al base material) and duplex treatment (EB alloying of Al base material and subsequent PVD <b>hard</b> <b>coating)</b> by means of improvement of the coating and com-pound hardness, friction and wear behavior (pin-on-disc test), as well as the corrosion resistance (potentiodynamic measurements in 0. 05 M H 2 SO 4). While the level of improvement in wear resistance {{as a result of the}} duplex treatments strongly depended on the adhesion of the thin coatings, the corrosion behavior was strongly influenced by the PVD deposition process and coating thickness...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the medium}} and small damping {{characteristics}} of the <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> compared with viscoelastic materials, the classical modal strain energy (CMSE) method {{cannot be applied to}} the prediction of damping characteristics of hard-coating composite structure directly.

First, the solution formula of modified modal strain energy (MMSE) method was derived and the relevant calculation procedure was proposed. Then, based on the principle that depositing the <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> on the locations where modal strain energy is higher, the damping optimization method and procedure were presented.
