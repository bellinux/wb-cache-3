500|$|Wartime {{production}} of coax, {{and for a}} period afterwards, tended to use standard plumbing pipe sizes for the outer conductor and standard AWG sizes for the inner conductor. [...] This resulted in coax that was nearly, but not quite, 50Ω. [...] Matching {{is a much more}} critical requirement at RF than it is at voice frequencies, so when cable started to become available that was truly 50 Ω a need arose for matching circuits to interface between the new cables and legacy equipment, such as the rather strange 51.5Ω to 50Ω <b>matching</b> <b>network.</b>|$|E
500|$|Zobel {{patented}} an impedance <b>matching</b> <b>network</b> in 1920 which, in essence, {{used the}} topology {{of what are}} now called m-type filters, but Zobel did not name them as such or analyse them by the image method. This pre-dated George Campbell's publication of his constant k-type design in 1922 on which the m-type filter is based. Zobel published the image analysis theory of m-type filters in 1923. [...] Once popular, M-type filters and image parameter designed filters in general are now rarely designed, having been superseded by more advanced network synthesis methods.|$|E
500|$|A {{simple method}} of {{impedance}} matching is stub matching {{with a single}} stub. [...] However, a single stub will only produce a perfect match at one particular frequency. [...] This technique is therefore only suitable for narrow band applications. [...] To widen the bandwidth multiple stubs may be used, and the structure then takes on {{the form of a}} stub filter. [...] The design proceeds {{as if it were a}} filter except that a different parameter is optimised. [...] In a frequency filter typically the parameter optimised is stopband rejection, passband attenuation, steepness of transition, or some compromise between these. [...] In a <b>matching</b> <b>network</b> the parameter optimised is the impedance match. [...] The function of the device does not require a restriction of bandwidth, but the designer is nevertheless forced to choose a bandwidth because of the structure of the device.|$|E

2500|$|Dipole antennas of lengths {{approximately}} equal to any odd multiple of λ/2 are also resonant, presenting a small reactance (which can be cancelled {{by a small}} length adjustment). However these are rarely used. One size that is more practical though is a dipole with a length of 5/4 wavelengths. Not being close to 3/2 wavelengths, this antenna's impedance has a large (negative) reactance and can only be used with an impedance <b>matching</b> <b>network</b> (or [...] "antenna tuner"). It is a desirable length because such an antenna has the highest gain for any dipole which isn't a great deal longer.|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{wide-band}} small antennas is steadily increasing for both {{civilian and military}} applications due to the explosive growth of wireless communications systems. Linearly polarized electrically small antennas can be generally classified as TM 10 and TE 10 mode antennas. For a TM 10 mode antenna, the input impedance of the antenna is considerably reactive with a small real part. In contrast, the input ad-mittance of a TE 10 mode antenna {{is characterized by a}} high susceptance and a small conductance, i. e. the input impedance is almost a short. It is therefore critical to match the antenna to a receiver (or transmitter) to optimize the transfer of power in the frequency range of interest. With conventional passive <b>matching</b> <b>networks,</b> the antennas can be only matched over narrow frequency bands.

50|$|So an {{additional}} problem beyond canceling the unwanted reactance is of matching the remaining resistive impedance to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. In principle this {{can always be}} done with a transformer, however the turns ratio of a transformer is not adjustable. A general <b>matching</b> <b>network</b> {{with at least two}} adjustments can be made to correct both components of impedance. Matching networks using discrete inductors and capacitors will have losses associated with those components, and will have power restrictions when used for transmitting. Avoiding these difficulties, commercial antennas are generally designed with fixed matching elements or feeding strategies to get an approximate match to standard coax, such as 50 or 75 ohms. Antennas based on the dipole (rather than vertical antennas) should include a balun in between the transmission line and antenna element, which may be integrated into any such <b>matching</b> <b>network.</b>|$|E
50|$|Resonant antennas are {{expected}} to be used around a particular resonant frequency; an antenna must therefore be built or ordered to match the frequency range of the intended application. A particular antenna design will present a particular feedpoint impedance. While this may affect the choice of an antenna, an antenna's impedance can also be adapted to the desired impedance level of a system using a <b>matching</b> <b>network</b> while maintaining the other characteristics (except for a possible loss of efficiency).|$|E

We propose a novel hierarchical approach to <b>match</b> hydrographic <b>networks,</b> by extracting natural structures called strokes.

30|$|Reconfigurable <b>matching</b> <b>networks</b> (RMNs) {{are used}} for {{improving}} PA efficiency and frequency reconfigurability and changing load impedance. This is the approach of dynamic load modulation (DLM) [8]. Recently, some papers have been published using varactor-based <b>matching</b> <b>networks.</b> They offer very promising outcomes in transmitter efficiency enhancements [9]. In this work, we propose {{the use of a}} transmitter based on a LINC architecture, in which the RMNs are included to improve the efficiency. The setup uses two RMNs which are placed between the PA output and the combiner input so as to enhance the PA efficiency and, therefore, the efficiency of the whole system.|$|R
40|$|Some MIMO {{applications}} require antennas to {{be closely}} spaced, which result in mutual coupling among antennas and high spatial correlation for signals. In order {{to compensate for}} the performance degradation due to correlation and coupling, impedance <b>matching</b> <b>networks</b> may be used. Recently, it was shown that uncoupled <b>matching</b> <b>networks</b> could be optimized against a given performance metric with the constraint of similar matching impedance for all antennas, i. e., balanced matching. In this paper, we investigate the use of uncoupled <b>matching</b> <b>networks</b> with both balanced and unbalanced load impedances, where either the received power or the channel capacity is optimized. For two- and three-element dipole arrays, we show numerically that a significant performance improvement can be achieved by introducing unbalanced matching. Observations suggest that the achieved improvement varies with array geometry and propagation environment. For example, a large capacity gain of up to 23 % is realized when matching a uniform linear array to propagation environments that are asymmetrical about the array broadside, whereas the symmetrical environments do not benefit as much from unbalanced matching...|$|R
