Shotshell reloading is similar to cartridge reloading, except that, instead of a bullet, a wad and a measure of shot are used, and after loading the shot, the shell is crimped shut.

[...] The shotshell loader contains stations to resize the shell, measure powder, load the wad, measure shot, and crimp the shell. Due to the low cost of modern plastic shotshells, and the additional complexity of reloading fired shells, shotshell handloading is not as popular as cartridge handloading. [...] For example, unlike when handloading rifle and pistol cartridges, where all the various components (cases, gas checks, powder, primers, etc.) from different manufacturers are usually all interchangeable, shotshells typically are loaded for particular brands of shotshell cases (called hulls) only with one specific brand of wad, shot cup (if used), primer, and powder, further increasing the complexity and difficulty of reloading shotshells. Substitution of components is not considered safe, as changing just one component, such as a brand of primer, can increase pressures {{by as much as}} 3500 PSI, which may exceed SAAMI pressure limits. [...] Reloading shotshells is therefore more along the lines of precisely following a recipe with non-fungible components. [...] Where shotshell reloading remains popular, however, is for making specialized shotgun shells, such as for providing lowered recoil, when making low-cost [...] "poppers" [...] used for training retrievers before hunting season to acclimate hunting dogs to the sound of a gun firing without actually shooting projectiles, for achieving better shot patterning, or for providing other improvements or features not available in commercially loaded shotshells at any price, such as when handloading obsolete shotshells with brass cases for gauges of shotshells that are no longer commercially manufactured.|$|E
60|$|Best {{form for}} Memoranda.--I have remarked {{that almost every}} {{traveller}} who is distinguished for the copiousness and accuracy of his journals, has written them in a remarkably small but distinct handwriting. Hard pencil-marks (HHH pencils) on common paper, or on <b>metallic</b> <b>paper</b> are very durable. Dr. Barth wrote his numerous observations entirely in Indian-ink. He kept a tiny saucer in his pocket, rubbed with the ink; {{when he wanted to}} use it, he rubbed it up with his wetted finger-tip, or resupplied it with fresh ink, and filled his pen and wrote. Captain Burton wrote very much in the dark, when lying awake at night; he used a board with prominent lines of wood, such as is adopted by the blind. It is very important that what is written should be intelligible to a stranger after a long lapse of time. A traveller may die, and his uncompleted work perish with him; or he may return, and years will pass by, and suddenly some observations he had made will be called in question.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Characteristic {{low-temperature}} mechanical loss peaks {{are reported}} in cold-rolled steel sheets. Similar mechanical loss peaks are observed in both <b>metallic</b> and <b>paper</b> substrates covered with thin oil films. The surface induced origin of these peaks is elucidated through direct comparison of mechanical loss peaks observed in the as-received, cold-rolled samples with loss peaks observed in <b>metallic</b> and <b>paper</b> substrates covered with thin films of the arachis oils. In all of these instances, similar low-temperature mechanical loss peaks are observed in the temperature range from 180 K up to 300 K in both low-frequency resonant and low-frequency sub-resonant mechanical spectrometers. It is concluded that low-temperature mechanical loss peaks are generated by surface induced effects that arise from the oil film itself...|$|R

50|$|A {{cartridge}} {{is a type}} {{of ammunition}} packaging a bullet or shot, a propellant substance (usually either smokeless powder or black powder) and a primer within a <b>metallic,</b> <b>paper,</b> or plastic case that is precisely made to fit within the firing chamber of a firearm. The primer is a small charge of an impact-sensitive or electric-sensitive chemical mixture that can be located {{at the center of the}} case head (centerfire ammunition), inside a rim (rimfire ammunition), or in a projection such as in a pinfire or teat-fire cartridge. Military and commercial producers continue to pursue the goal of caseless ammunition. A cartridge without a bullet is called a blank. One that is completely inert (contains no active primer and no propellant) is called a dummy.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} half of the nineteenth century, U.S. money was {{circulated}} in both <b>metallic</b> and <b>paper</b> currency. As established by the Coinage Act of 1792, silver coins were authorized in denominations of $0.05, $0.10, $0.25, $0.50 and $1.00. After the Coinage Act of 1834, silver (which was previously overvalued with respect to gold) became significantly undervalued and was exported to European markets where it was traded at a higher price. This led to its near disappearance from par-circulation after 1834. Despite the attempts by Jackson, Taney and members of Congress to supplant paper currency in favor of “hard-money,” there were over a thousand banks issuing their own notes in small denominations (between $0.01 and $2.50).|$|R

40|$|The author {{starts from}} {{the thesis that}} it is {{especially}} necessary to manage the production of cash money, taking into consideration and applying the conceptions of modern management. Cash money (<b>metallic</b> and <b>paper)</b> is a specific “product” that is produced according {{to the needs of}} monetary traffic, as well as meeting the standards related to modern notaphily, i. e. numismatics. For several reasons, the author elaborates his thesis on the example of the issuing of Croatian contemporary metallic money. The most important of these reasons are that Croatia has its own mint, that issuing metallic money makes it possible to attain significant non-fiscal effects through its management, and that the issuing of national money has wider cultural, social, legal and other dimensions. In the elaboration of his thesis, the author takes into account the influence of the globalization and integration processes in which Croatia is a participant. ...|$|R

Compared with existing methods, the model presented in this paper considers the mutual coupling between the monopoles and shielded enclosure.
