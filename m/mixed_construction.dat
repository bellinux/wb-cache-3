5|$|Development of the I-6 (Istrebitel—fighter) {{began in}} September 1928 with a {{deadline}} for delivery for the first prototype of 1 August 1929 after the first prototypes of the Polikarpov I-3 were completed. Although the new fighter shared many {{of the characteristics of}} the earlier design, including the staggered sesquiplane, single-bay, layout of the wings, it was a new design which used a nine-cylinder, single-row, air-cooled Bristol Jupiter radial engine rather the water-cooled inline engine of its predecessor. It was designed by the OSS (—Landplane Department), later redesignated as OPO-1 (—Experimental Department) of Aviatrest ("Aviation Trust") under the supervision of Nikolai Polikarpov, head designer of the department. It was originally intended to be compared to the I-3, but this was changed to an evaluation of construction methods with the wooden construction I-6 compared to the <b>mixed</b> <b>construction</b> Polikarpov I-5. Both aircraft used the Jupiter VI engine for which a license had recently been negotiated.|$|E

25|$|In 1924 Nieuport {{produced}} a {{design for a}} single-seat sesquiplane fighter of <b>mixed</b> <b>construction,</b> the Nieuport-Delage NiD 42, which was ordered in small numbers for the French air force, entering service in 1927. Nieuport developed three refined versions in 1927, the all-metal NiD-52 and NiD-72 and the <b>mixed</b> <b>construction</b> Nieuport-Delage NiD 62. Like the NiD 42 on which it was based, the NiD 52 was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Hb V12 engine, but the wooden monocoque rear fuselage was replaced by an equivalent made of duralumin and the wooden wing ribs by light alloy, while retaining a fabric covering. Both the main and secondary wings were of reduced area compared to the NiD-42, and an enlarged tail fitted {{in an attempt to}} improve the aircraft's handling. Armament remained two 7.7mm Vickers machine guns.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was of <b>mixed</b> <b>construction.</b> The fuselage was built from wood {{and was a}} monocoque design. The wing had a wooden structure, with fiberglass leading edge.

5000|$|Medieval Latin {{had ceased}} to be a living {{language}} and was instead a scholarly language of the minority of educated men in medieval Europe used in official documents more than for everyday communication. That resulted in two major features of Medieval Latin compared with Classical Latin. First, many authors attempted to [...] "show off" [...] their knowledge of Classical Latin by using rare or archaic constructions, sometimes anachronistically (haphazardly <b>mixing</b> <b>constructions</b> from Republican and Imperial Latin, which in reality existed centuries apart). Second, many lesser scholars had a limited grasp of [...] "proper" [...] Latin or were increasingly influenced by Vulgar Latin, which was mutating into the Romance languages.|$|R

The airfoil is a modified Gö 535 section.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the other}} three designs, the R.90 was a biplane. It was of <b>mixed</b> <b>construction,</b> with a welded steel-tube {{fuselage}} and wooden, single-bay wings, with the upper wings being gulled {{into the top of}} the fuselage to give a better view for the pilot. Two floats were fitted. The proposed armament was four 7.5mm machine guns, two in the lower wing and two in the floats.|$|E
25|$|The Il-2 is a single-engine, propeller-driven, low-wing {{monoplane}} of <b>mixed</b> <b>construction</b> {{with a crew}} of two (one {{in early}} versions), specially designed for assault operations. Its most notable feature was the inclusion of armor in an airframe load-bearing scheme. Armor plates replaced the frame and paneling throughout the nacelle and middle part of the fuselage, and an armored hull made of riveted homogeneous armor steel AB-1 (AB-2) secured the aircraft’s engine, cockpit, water and oil radiators, and fuel tanks.|$|E

25|$|In 1919, John Kenworthy, chief {{designer}} of the motor manufacturer Austin Motor Company, (who had built large numbers of aircraft under license during the First World War) designed a small single-seater light aircraft in order {{to cash in on}} an expected boom in private flying. The resulting aircraft, named the Austin Whippet, was a small single-seat biplane of <b>mixed</b> <b>construction,</b> with a fabric covered steel tube fuselage, and single-bay, folding wooden wings. The wings avoided the need for rigging wires by use of streamlined steel lift struts.|$|E
25|$|The ICAR 36 was a high-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane of <b>mixed</b> <b>construction,</b> with {{a closed}} cockpit, single engine, and fixed landing gear. It had a welded steel tube fuselage, covered with plywood, and tapered single-spar, plywood-covered wings. The crew of two {{sat in the}} cockpit, forward of the wing, which was equipped with a radio and could be fitted with twin controls. The cabin for six passengers, with wide rectangular windows and access doors at the rear, was aft and below the cockpit / wings. There were also two baggage compartments.|$|E
25|$|The AB-13 {{was a small}} single-bay biplane of <b>mixed</b> <b>construction.</b> It had wooden {{stressed-skin}} wings with plywood skinning that folded {{to allow}} easy storage aboard ship, while combat flaps were fitted as the aircraft was required to have sufficient maneuverability for air combat {{as well as its}} normal observation missions. The fuselage was of metal construction, with the pilot sitting in an open cockpit, but the observer's position being enclosed. Both float and wheeled undercarriages were designed, with the seaplane having a single main float, while the landplane version had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Power was provided by a single Nakajima Hikari radial engine.|$|E
40|$|Dry <b>construction</b> <b>mixes</b> {{are today}} {{a product of}} high technologies. Depending on the purpose and {{requirements}} to the properties {{it is easy to}} produce dry <b>construction</b> <b>mixes</b> with different compositions and operating indicators in plant conditions using the necessary modifying additives. Cement, gypsum and other mineral binders are used in the <b>construction</b> <b>mixes.</b> Different types of cement are more heavily used in dry <b>construction</b> <b>mixes.</b> Such dry mixes are believed to be more effective materials comparing to traditional cement-sandy solutions of centralized preparation. The authors present the results of the investigations on obtaining biocidal cement-sand compositions. It was established, that introduction of sodium sulfate into the composition provides obtaining the materials with funginert and fungicide properties. The strength properties of the mixes modified by carbon nanotubes and biocide additive were investigated by mathematical planning methods. The results of the investigations showed that the modification of cement stone structure by carbon nanotubes positively influences their strength and technological properties. Nanomodifying of construction composites by introducing carbon nanotubes may be effectively used at different stages of structure formation of a construction material...|$|R
