40|$|On 27 April 1998, the European Union (EU) {{removed the}} People's Republic of China from {{its list of}} {{non-market}} economies (NMEs) due to the progress made under China's economic reforms. After that, it has applied a hybrid anti-dumping policy towards imports from China, {{including the use of}} the analogue country method, conditional <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> <b>treatment,</b> one country one duty rule and individual treatment. However, there has been no significant change as far as the EU anti-dumping authority's practice is concerned. This is inconsistent with China's current economic status as a transitional economy with many sectors very close to a market economy. This thesis analyses the implementation of the policy and explores its legal problems and issues from both a theoretical and practical standpoint. The study begins by examining the origin of EU anti-dumping legislation - the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) anti-dumping rules. It identifies the legal problems of EU anti-dumping practice in the context of China's economic reforms starting from 1979. In order to suggest solutions to several of the problems thus identified, comparative studies are made to reveal alternative strategies by illustrating the anti-dumping legislation of the U. S, Australia, New Zealand and Japan insofar as it is applicable to China. Due to China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 11 December 2001, new issues and disputes may arise with regard to the EU's anti-dumping practice. With regard to all of these issues, this thesis finally attempts to propose solutions to both the EU and China. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|EU and China are {{important}} trade partners to each other; trade relationship {{is one of}} their crucial bilateral relationships. Within EU-China trade relationship, the dumping and anti-dumping issues play an important role. When EU commission initiates anti-dumping investigation, Chinese producers always have different responses. This study mainly focuses on the reasons behind Chinese producers’ various responses facing EU anti-dumping investigations. By digging out the real reasons behind Chinese producers’ various responses, this study is expected to make some contribution to the dumping and anti-dumping discussion between China and EU in academic level and to make some contribution to the policy adjusting of both sides in political lever. Some hypotheses drawing from a Chinese lawyer Tao Jingzhou’s claim in an interview are tested in this study. These hypotheses listed some possible factors affecting Chinese producers’ responses. There are many anti-dumping cases between China and EU, CFL-i (Integrated electronic compact fluorescent lamps) case initiated in April 2000 was chosen as a research object for case study in this research. When it comes to theory, Hirschman’s theory of exit and voice is used as the basic theory structure of this study. His followers especially Barry and Birch refined Hirschman’s model into exit-voice-silence. This model is implemented in this study as a theory approach. By interviewing some key people in the Chinese producers involving in CFL-i case and comparing the interview results with hypotheses, come conclusions are coming out: First, in the case study level, Chinese producers’ choice of options is in a dynamic process. With the change of situation, a certain producer can choose different option in different period of time. While this study verified the variables influencing the choice of Chinese producers mentioned by Tao Jingzhou in the hypotheses such as degree of depending on EU market, sufficient of funds, supports from local government, financial system, ownership of the company and the diversity of products, it found several other variables which also affect the decision making of Chinese producers such as nationalism, previous success experience. Second, when it comes to political level, for Chinese side, Chinese government especially local government should be more supportive when their enterprises are facing anti-dumping investigation from EU. In EU’s part, according to what has been discussed in the case study, currently it is not the time for EU to take China as a <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> <b>treatment.</b> However, its harsh criteria for applying for MET and individual treatment would get continuous severe critical from Chinese producers and government, which will negatively affect its trade relationship with China. For both sides, bilateral negotiations on anti-dumping duty or undertakings {{would be good for the}} long-run interests of both sides...|$|E

The investigators host information websites through which they field several hundred queries annually. This study investigated the experience of those treating head lice infections focusing on control difficulties. A short web-based questionnaire (available August, 2006 and February, 2007) yielded two hundred and ninety-four eligible responses which were analysed using grounded theory analysis processes. The mainly female (91. 1 %), working (76. 9 %), respondents from Australia, U. S.

40|$|It {{is often}} stated that {{globalization}} makes a smaller world by institutional conver-gence. Economic orders become alike across the world. This article addresses institutional change {{triggered by the}} global financial crisis of 2008 / 2009 and challenges this general conviction of worldwide convergence by comparing developments in emerging markets in Europe and Asia. The rise of emerging markets, both in Eastern Europe and in Asia, entailed encompassing institutional reform. In analysing {{the extent to which}} there is institutional convergence, the article follows the approach of Varieties of Capitalism. This approach distinguishes two ideal types of capitalism: a liberal <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> and a coordinated <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> In liberal <b>market</b> <b>economies,</b> firms are primarily driven by competition, whereas in coordinated <b>market</b> <b>economies</b> firms also coordinate with other actors by strategic interaction. The basic premise is that countries with a specific set of institutions develop institutional complementarities. Therefore, considering institutional change, liberal <b>market</b> <b>economies</b> and coordinated <b>market</b> <b>economies</b> are expected to respond in different ways to external shocks, such as the global financial crisis. Being aware of the pitfalls that the approach suffers from by simply pinpointing countries on a broad continuum, the article argues that the emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies</b> in Europe are on the liberal side of the scale. On top of that, it builds the argument of a tentative convergence towards further liberal institutional design. With respect to emerging markets in Asia, another development is observed. There is converging institutional change towards coordinated <b>market</b> <b>economies</b> characterized with strong state influence and an imperative bureaucracy. The expected convergence in the two groups of emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies</b> in Europe and Asia leads to the conviction of divergence between the groups...|$|R

A weak union movement and conservative politics based upon the authoritarian state’s alliance with big business did not contribute to welfare state development in South Korea. Instead, the state’s success in establishing a coordi-nated <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> through nurturing big companies and cultivating cooperative labor mobilization encouraged the development of company-based social benefits. While company-based cooperative institutions were placed in companies, various corporate benefit programs and health benefits for industrial workers in larger companies further developed.

This was accompanied by the lack of state-responsible welfare provision...|$|R

40|$|The {{failure of}} {{uncovered}} interest rate parity (UIP) {{is a well-known}} phenomenon of the last thirty years. UIP failure is more prominent in advanced economies than in emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies.</b> Typically, UIP estimation for an advanced economy generates a negative coefficient, meaning that a higher interest rate in advanced economy A {{will result in the}} appreciation of economy A's exchange rate. For emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies,</b> higher interest rates usually correspond to future depreciation, although this depreciation is not sufficient for UIP to hold. This paper shows that UIP holds in Russia better than in other emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies</b> when the UIP equation accounts for a constant risk premium. Consequently, there is no forward premium puzzle for Russian data for 2001 – 2014. To determine the results for Russia and to compare them with the results for other countries, we estimate UIP first for Russia and then for advanced and emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies</b> using seemingly unrelated regressions and panel data analysis. By comparing the profitability of static and dynamic carry trade strategies, we also confirm that in emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies,</b> risk premiums are often constant, whereas in advanced economies, risk premiums are almost always volatile. This may explain why UIP holds better in emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies.</b> It also enables us to formulate a hypothesis that macroeconomic policies of emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies</b> (e. g., the accumulation of large foreign exchange reserves) stabilize risk premiums...|$|R
