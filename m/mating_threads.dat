Fasteners with tapered shanks {{are designed to}} either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate. <b>Mating</b> <b>threads</b> are formed in the substrate as these fasteners are driven in. Fasteners with a non-tapered shank are designed to mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole.|$|E
50|$|Overuse or mis{{application}} {{of thread}} tape {{may be a}} hazard. Excess application of PTFE tape can prevent <b>mating</b> <b>threads</b> from fully engaging, reducing the shear point of the threads. Combining thread-seal tape with a pipe dope compound can also overload threads. Also, internal overhangs of loose material may constrict a joint or slough off and form a foreign body that could jam a valve seat. Therefore, use of PTFE tape as a thread sealant is generally not considered appropriate in fluid power (hydraulic) systems.|$|E
50|$|A nail is pounded with {{a series}} of impacts, each by a single hammer blow. These high {{velocity}} impacts overcome the static friction between the nail and the substrate. A pile driver achieves the same end, although on a much larger scale, the method being commonly used during civil construction projects to make building and bridge foundations. An impact wrench is a device designed to impart torque impacts to bolts to tighten or loosen them. At normal speeds, the forces applied to the bolt would be dispersed, via friction, to the <b>mating</b> <b>threads.</b> However, at impact speeds, the forces act on the bolt to move it before they can be dispersed. In ballistics, bullets utilize impact forces to puncture surfaces that could otherwise resist substantial forces. A rubber sheet, for example, behaves more like glass at typical bullet speeds. That is, it fractures, and does not stretch or vibrate.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{mechanical}} {{aspects of}} tightening screws over implants {{are important to}} ensure a successful prosthetic rehabilitation. Screw loosening is a common problem that can be avoided with passive adaptation of the components and an increased tensile force developed in the screw, a preload. Objective: This in vitro study evaluated the effect on preload of a carbon lubricant deposited on the surface of titanium alloy prosthetic screws: conventional Ti 6 Al 4 V and surface enhanced. Material and methods: Conventional titanium alloy prosthetic (n = 7) and carbon coating surface enhanced screws(n = 7) were compared. Each prosthetic screw supporting a metallic UCLA over an implant was tightened with the manufacturer’s recommended torque of 32 N. cm. The removal torque values, recorded for ten consecutive cycles of tightening and removal, were used to estimate the preload. Implant blocks were then sectioned and the interfaces were observed by light microscopy. Results: The lowest removal torque, and consequently the highest preload values, was achieved for the lubricated group in most cycles. The contacts between threads were located at the coronal aspect of all observed screw <b>mating</b> <b>threads.</b> Conclusion: Data indicate that the lower coefficient of friction of a carbon lubricant can generate higher preload. The machining precision observed produced the adaptation and regular contact interfaces...|$|E

50|$|Some {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} extreme dimorphism {{may be the result}} of males avoiding detection by the females. For males of these species, being smaller in size may be advantageous in moving the central hub of a web so female spiders may be less likely to detect the male, or even if detected as prey to be eaten, the small size may indicate little nutritional value. Larger-bodied male araneids may be advantageous when mating on a <b>mating</b> <b>thread</b> because the thread is constructed from the edge of the web orb to structural threads or to nearby vegetation. Here larger males may be less likely to be cannibalized, as the males are able to copulate while the female is hanging, which may make them safer from cannibalism. In one subfamily of Araneid that uses a <b>mating</b> <b>thread,</b> Gasteracanthinae, sexual cannibalism is apparently absent despite extreme size dimorphism.|$|R

2500|$|After {{locating}} a receptive female, male jewel spiders {{will begin}} courtship by first attaching a [...] "mating thread" [...] from nearby plants {{to the edge}} of the female's orb web.

The female will respond by moving towards the source of the vibrations, eventually climbing unto the <b>mating</b> <b>thread</b> itself. Once this happens, the male will wrap its legs around the female tightly and insert its pedipalps into the female's epigyne, transferring its spermatophores (silk packets containing sperm) into the female's spermathecae.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} trends in mechanical engineering development is the constant improvement of load capacity of machines, mechanisms, units and parts without increasing their overall dimensions and weight. This is also true for today’s most prospective planetary rollerscrew mechanisms (PRSM) converting motion from rotary to linear type. The problem of PRSM load capacity improvement deserves more attention, because these mechanisms have very high performance characteristics, which leads to problems in the choice of support devices for these mechanisms. However, for many mechanical engineering industries it is important to decrease the PRSMs weight and dimensions, or to improve their reliability and durability. This has led to finding the reserves for improving the PRSM load capacity by decreasing the thread turn profile angle, α, of PRSM threaded parts, as compared to α = 90 ° in traditional mechanisms. When PRSM calculation methods were developed, it was decided to use α = 90 ° for transforming the mechanism parts into a physical model and a design pattern. It allowed us to reduce the PRSM designing to well-known roller bearing designing based on very extensive experimental data. Proposed PRSM designs do not contradict to accepted physical models and design patterns – they just have different basic characteristics of PRSM, i. e. static and dynamic load ratings. Proposed PRSM designs with a thread turn profile angle α= 70 ° on their parts allow to increase the load capacity by 15 %, as compared to traditional PRSMs, which have threaded parts with a thread turn profile angle α = 90 °. There are two factors, which can improve the PRSM load capacity. The first one is the decrease of normal force between <b>mating</b> <b>thread</b> turns of a screw and a roller with the same operational axial force. The second one is the increase of the radius of the shaped profile of a roller thread turn resulting in the expansion of the contact area pattern between the <b>mating</b> <b>thread</b> turns of a screw and a roller. The first factor dominates here. For implementing the proposed PRSM designs into production, one has to explore additionally the effect of α-angle on linkage parameters, process requirements and specific features of the initial contact between the <b>mating</b> <b>thread</b> turns of a screw and a roller. </p...|$|R

40|$|Web-building spiders are {{important}} models for sexual selection. While {{our understanding of}} post-copulatory mechanisms including sperm competition and cryptic female choice is considerable, our knowledge of courtship and how it influences male and female mating decisions is still extremely poor. Here, we provide the first comprehensive description of male courtship behaviour and vibrations generated in the web by the orb-web spider, Argiope keyserlingi - a recognised model species. We identified three main elements of male courtship: shudders, abdominal wags and <b>mating</b> <b>thread</b> dances (including both plucks and bounces). The vibrations generated by these behaviours are described in detail. Male shuddering behaviour {{appears to have a}} strong influence on female latency to mate acceptance, with males that shudder at high rates without compromising shudder duration being preferred. Shuddering behaviour may also mediate female aggressive behaviour, with males that generate long shudders less likely to be cannibalised after copulation. Male abdominal wagging behaviour, however, appears to have only limited influence on female mating decisions. This study provides avenues for future work that synthesises pre- and post-copulatory mechanisms in web-building spiders to generate an all-encompassing model of how sexual selection operates. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Courtship {{signals are}} {{expected}} to be consistent within but vary between males of different qualities. Such traits are, therefore, predicted to exhibit high repeatability. However, studies have shown that courtship behaviors vary greatly in their within-individual repeatability, resulting in substantial variation in their ability to reflect male quality. This has implications for the evolution of female mate choice and courtship communication, as low levels of repeatability may reflect courtship signals that do not provide accurate quality information to females. In this article, we tested whether male courtship shuddering in the tropical orb-web spider, Argiope radon, influences female mate choice. We also tested whether male shudder performance reflects male phenotypic condition and is repeatable. We found that male shudder performance and condition predicted female latency to move onto the <b>mating</b> <b>thread,</b> a measure of mate preference. Aspects of male shudder performance were positively correlated with male body condition. Further, we found surprisingly high levels of repeatability in male courtship shuddering, ranking among the highest levels recorded to date for courtship behavior. We suggest that male courtship shuddering functions as an important indicator of male quality, with strong potential to respond to selection. 6 page(s...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{provides}} {{theoretical research}} of load distribution across the thread turns of the planetary roller-screw mechanism (RSM). A characteristic {{feature of the}} theoretical approach of {{the paper is the}} use of a RSM rod model with two elastic contact layers (the first layer is composed of screw-rollers, the second – of nut-rollers). A <b>threaded</b> <b>mating</b> of each elastic layer is considered as a connection with continuous turns, which is closest to the truth and consistent to classical approaches. A similar approach was applied for the ball-and-screw mechanisms with a member point contact. Thus, differential analytical closed-form equations may be used to solve this task. Based on the initial equation of compatibility of strains, axial offsets of contact layer points and the sum of screw, roller and nut turn deflections are calculated; then, load distribution across the turns may be determined. Load distribution depends both on the RSM geometry (pitch, profile angle, entry number, and thread diameter), material of threaded elements, manufacturing accuracy, and on mating friction forces. With the dependencies of load distribution across the turns of zero-clearance RSMs obtained, we have determined that maximum load is imposed on the outermost turns, which corresponds to classical solutions proposed by N.
