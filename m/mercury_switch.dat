2500|$|Magnet. This ensures a {{good contact}} when the contact closes. [...] It also {{provides}} hysteresis to prevent short heating cycles, {{as the temperature}} must be raised several degrees before the contacts will open. As an alternative, some thermostats instead use a <b>mercury</b> <b>switch</b> {{on the end of}} the bimetal coil. [...] The weight of the mercury {{on the end of the}} coil tends to keep it there, also preventing short heating cycles. [...] However, this type of thermostat is banned in many countries due to its highly and permanently toxic nature if broken. When replacing these thermostats they must be regarded as chemical waste.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} mid-1930s clockworks were a Seth Thomas Clock Company 8-day timepiece, Model #4 - 1912 tower clock {{movement with}} serial number 3180. This movement had a 4 foot long pendulum with a 28 lb. pendulum ball. It featured a power wind mechanism with a <b>mercury</b> <b>switch</b> {{that included a}} power reserve of 2 to 3 hours. When the weights dropped to a fixed distance the <b>mercury</b> <b>switch</b> was triggered which then activated the power wind mechanism to automatically rewind the weights. The movement was eventually converted to a full electric motor driven mechanism (electrified) in the 1980s.|$|E

50|$|A <b>mercury</b> <b>switch</b> is an {{electrical}} switch that opens and closes a circuit {{when a small}} amount of the liquid metal mercury connects metal electrodes to close the circuit. There are several different basic designs (tilt, displacement, radial, etc.) but they all share the common design strength of non-eroding switch contacts.|$|E
50|$|Since {{mercury is}} a {{poisonous}} heavy metal, devices containing <b>mercury</b> <b>switches</b> {{must be treated}} as hazardous waste for disposal. Because it is now RoHS restricted, most modern applications have eliminated it. A metal ball and contact wires can directly replace it, but may require additional circuitry to eliminate switch bounce. Low-precision thermostats use a bimetal strip and a switch contact. Precision thermostats use a thermistor or silicon temperature sensor. Low-cost accelerometers replace the <b>mercury</b> tilt <b>switch</b> in precision applications.|$|R

50|$|A {{very simple}} {{example of an}} {{instrumentation}} system is a mechanical thermostat, used to control a household furnace and thus to control room temperature. A typical unit senses temperature with a bi-metallic strip. It displays temperature by a needle on the free end of the strip. It activates the furnace by a <b>mercury</b> <b>switch.</b> As the switch is rotated by the strip, the mercury makes physical (and thus electrical) contact between electrodes.|$|E

The mechanical circuit is steered by a <b>mercury</b> <b>switch.</b> The power transmission is made by a vee belt and is still working today.|$|E
