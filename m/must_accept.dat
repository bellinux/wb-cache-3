5|$|The {{wooden core}} gives the bow its shape and {{dimensional}} stability. It is often made of multiple pieces, joined with animal glue in V-splices, so the wood <b>must</b> <b>accept</b> glue well. Pieced construction allows the sharp bends that many designs require, {{and the use}} of woods with different mechanical properties for the bending and nonbending sections.|$|E

5|$|William Lane Craig criticised Oppy's {{study as}} too vague for useful classification. Craig argued that an {{argument}} can be classified as ontological if it attempts to deduce the existence of God, along with other necessary truths, from his definition. He suggested that proponents of ontological arguments would claim that, if one fully understood the concept of God, one <b>must</b> <b>accept</b> his existence. William L. Rowe defined ontological arguments as those that start from the definition of God and, using only a priori principles, conclude with God's existence.|$|E

5|$|At an eco {{hotel in}} the desert, Greene tells Medrano that now he {{controls}} the majority of Bolivia's water supply, Medrano <b>must</b> <b>accept</b> a new contract that makes Greene Planet Bolivia's sole water utility company at significantly higher rates. Bond infiltrates the complex, kills {{the chief of police}} (Fernando Guillén Cuervo) for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the hotel. After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum, leaving him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil, wondering if Greene will get thirsty enough to drink it.|$|E
5|$|Several {{paragraphs}} outline potential {{conditions for}} an armistice, rejecting any {{notion that the}} German Empire has any place in dictating the terms of peace. The authors also insist that the German populace <b>must</b> <b>accept</b> some blame for having not resisted the march to war {{on the part of}} the German government. The authors maintain that immediate calls for negotiation would not be favorable, as the German state would potentially dictate the process from a position of diplomatic and military power. Instead, the manifesto proclaims that the war must be continued so that the German state loses its military strength, and by extension, its ability to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|In January 2012, Denise Fox (Diane Parish) gives Marsden {{a letter}} incriminating Phil {{in the death}} of a {{homeless}} man, who died when he torched the car lot in an insurance scam in 1994; she adds that Phil also murdered Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson), and Marsden thanks Denise for the information. Marsden arrives in Walford and begins trailing Phil. She asks Denise not to tell Phil that she is in town, wanting to ensure Phil's imprisonment. Marsden then targets Phil's son Ben (Joshua Pascoe), interviewing him about Stella's death. Ben was abused by Stella and finds Marsden's questions distressing; however, she continues to press him. After a falling-out with Phil Ben changes his statement, telling Marsden that Phil told Stella to jump off a building or he would push her. Marsden then arrests Phil for murder, and Ben reveals he was stalking him. She informs Phil's partner, Shirley, that he has been charged with Stella's murder. Ben pleads with Marsden to keep his statement a secret from the Mitchells, but she tells him he <b>must</b> <b>accept</b> that his father will learn about Ben's involvement in his arrest eventually. After discovering Ben's lies about Phil, Ian then passes this information on to Marsden and Ben is arrested. On the day of Phil's release he helps Ben hide his involvement in Heather's murder; Marsden tells Phil at the police station she will contact him about Ben's accusations. The charges against Ben are dropped; Marsden visits Phil, taunting him that he will eventually slip up, and suggests that Ben may ultimately bring Phil down.|$|E

25|$|Critics of long {{residency}} hours {{trace the}} problem {{to the fact that}} a resident has no alternatives to positions that are offered, meaning residents <b>must</b> <b>accept</b> all conditions of employment, including very long work hours, and that they must also, in many cases, contend with poor supervision. This process, they contend, reduces the competitive pressures on hospitals, resulting in low salaries and long, unsafe work hours.|$|E

25|$|Trespass and trover {{were both}} actions founded upon possession. For many centuries, they were {{alternative}} remedies for the wrongful taking of, or damage to chattels. There was {{a distinction between}} the actions. In the theory of trespass, the plaintiff remained the owner of the chattel, with the possession or property rights interrupted or interfered with. In this case, the plaintiff <b>must</b> <b>accept</b> the chattel back when it was tendered. Recovery was limited to any damage to the chattel, or from the interruption of property rights.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{as late as}} 1970, Coach Al McGuire of Marquette, the 8th-ranked team in {{the final}} AP poll of the season, spurned an NCAA at-large {{invitation}} because the Warriors {{were going to be}} placed in the NCAA Midwest Regional (Fort Worth, Texas) instead of closer to home in the Mideast Regional (Dayton, Ohio). The team played in the NIT instead, which it won. This led the NCAA to decree in 1971 that any school to which it offered a bid <b>must</b> <b>accept</b> it or be prohibited from participating in postseason competition, reducing the pool of teams that could accept an NIT invitation.|$|E
