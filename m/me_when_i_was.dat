25|$|Oh, I'm now {{fully aware}} of the mark Led Zeppelin made on the musical landscape. My {{awareness}} was re-heightened when we were remastering the material to do that CD box set in 1990. When you hear it all, song after song, you realise what a textbook it is for musicians who are coming along, and that's so great. The whole thing is about passing it on, because that's how it was done for <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> learning from all those old blues and rockabilly records. It's all part of how this cultural phenomenon keeps moving on. I think everyone carries the flame on.|$|E
25|$|On 2 May 2008, US President George W. Bush said he {{was asking}} Congress to approve an extra $770million funding for {{international}} food aid. On 16 October 2008, in a speech at a United Nations gathering on World Food Day, former US president Bill Clinton criticized the bipartisan coalition in Congress that blocked efforts to make some aid donations in cash rather than in food. Referring in part to policies that had pressured African governments to reduce subsidies for fertilizer and other agricultural inputs, Clinton also said:We need the World Bank, the IMF, all the big foundations, and all the governments to admit that, for 30 years, we all blew it, including <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> President. We were wrong to believe that food was like some other product in international trade, {{and we all have}} to go back to a more responsible and sustainable form of agriculture.The release of Japan's rice reserves onto the market may bring the rice price down significantly. As of 16 May, anticipation of the move had already lowered prices by 14% in a single week.|$|E

An EATS graduate later remarked that [...] "under Air Vice-Marshal Wrigley we got tremendous service... I was in North Africa, Italy, Sardinia, Corsica and then back in the United Kingdom. We got our mail, we got our comforts... Not only that, when some cow went and pinched 100 quid from <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> on leave in London, the next day, with a shaking hand, I was able to sign for another 100 quid and have a good time." ...|$|E

500|$|The year 1968 {{marked the}} start of what Dylan himself later termed his [...] "amnesia", {{referring}} {{to a form of}} writer's block he experienced post-John Wesley Harding (1967), when painting had replaced songwriting as his preferred creative outlet. Well known for his unsophisticated musical approach, particularly in comparison to Harrison's broader [...] "harmonic palette", author Simon Leng suggests, Dylan was now eager to learn some more-advanced chords. Harrison began demonstrating various major seventh, diminished and augmented chord shapes – [...] "all these funny chords people showed <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a kid", as he later put it.

500|$|The siege failed, Bolingbroke was crowned and the {{new king}} granted the Castle and Honour of Pevensey to Pelham {{as a reward for}} his loyalty. The Lancastrian kings {{subsequently}} used the castle as a prison for high-ranking nobles. Its inmates included King James I of Scotland, who was captured while en route to France in 1405, and Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York, who was held at Pevensey after becoming involved in a plot against Henry IV. On his death, Edward bestowed £20 in his will to Thomas Playsted, apparently one of his jailers, [...] "for the kindness he showed <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in ward at Pevensey." [...] Henry IV's second wife Joan of Navarre was imprisoned by Joan's stepson Henry V on charges of plotting to kill him through witchcraft; she was released in 1422 after being held at Pevensey for three years. When the Tudor dynasty took over the castle was abandoned, and by 1573 it was recorded to be in ruins.|$|E

He went into further detail on Front Row, in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk to <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that what I heard was my memories of my father. An engram, or something in my head...This is not about God, but somewhere around there is where gods come from." ...|$|E

So, we also worked on it. We actually went to Rajasthan and observed the local culture and their way of dressing, we researched a lot about their costumes, history and great personalities 400 years ago and planned it accordingly." [...] Ram Charan sported a long hairdo for both of his characters in the film.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} Beyoncé as the female protagonist singing about {{her love for}} the [...] "huge ego" [...] of her lover. Jay Lustig of New Jersey On-Line further noted that the song may be an insight into Beyoncé's marriage to Jay-Z. In an interview with Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, Beyoncé clarified that [...] "Ego" [...] is on the Sasha Fierce disc because it is [...] "fun" [...] and very [...] "Sasha Fierce". She further explained that [...] "Ego" [...] reveals the story about someone being [...] "very confident and having [...] swagger when they walk and when they talk, and that {{being one of the}} reasons why [...] attracted to them." [...] The song explores the restrained vocals of Beyoncé singing [...] "I talk like this, cos I can back it up" [...] and consists of a piano breakdown. As Beyoncé sings, she lets out a slinky snarl in her voice. She describes the ego of her love interest as: [...] "It’s too big, it’s too wide, it’s too strong, it won’t fit, it’s too much." [...] The remix of the song features Kanye West rapping on it. He sings the lines, [...] "Now I’m standing next to Jay, who's standing next to B / Could have been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me / That's good for my ego...

"This Kiss" [...] {{was written}} by Jepsen, Kelly Covell, Matthew Koma, and Stefan Kendal Gordy, also known as Redfoo from electropop duo LMFAO, through e-mails, text {{messaging}} and telephone calls. Jepsen explained that she had [...] "never written a song that way before so I'd definitely say it was new," [...] adding that [...] "there was something really exciting about being {{on the phone and}} singing ideas to each other and then calling each other back and re-writing lyrics in your BlackBerry and iPhone and seeing it all being exchanged." [...] The singer also revealed that she was pleased with the creative process of the song, commenting that [...] "despite all this craziness, [...] remains the same. And that same exciting feeling that I had before anybody knew <b>me,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just beginning to work on 'Call Me Maybe', is the same feeling I had today with Redfoo from LMFAO. You can sense the people who really have it are about writing that right word or that right melody to make it lift and make you feel that perfect emotion." [...] "This Kiss" [...] was recorded at Party Rock Studio with Redfoo in 2012 after Redfoo recorded ideas at Sonic Vista Studios Ibiza, Spain, and was released as the second single from Kiss on September 10, 2012. [...] "This Kiss" [...] is a mid-tempo dance-pop track which lyrically speaks about a kiss being something Jepsen can't resist and the lips of her beloved, featuring lyrics such as [...] "This kiss is something I can't resist/ Your lips are undeniable/This kiss is something I can't risk/Your heart is unreliable" [...] during the chorus.
