The research question is: How can the behaviour of the MEPs of the Dutch Freedom Party be characterized? The behaviour of the MEPs of the Freedom Party is researched {{through the use}} of role theory. There are many different typologies concerning the roles of members of national parliaments, MEPs and eurosceptic MEPs which are discussed in this thesis.

50|$|But {{there is}} {{currently}} no regulation at all for lobbying activities in France and, as a consequence, this practice suffers {{from a lack of}} transparency. There is no regulated access to the French institutions and no register specific to France, but there is one for the European Union where French lobbyists can register themselves. For example, the internal rule of the National Assembly (art. 23 and 79) forbids members of Parliament to be linked with a particular interest. However, MPs don’t have to declare their interest and the list of MPs' assistants is not public. Also, there is no rule at all for consultation of interest groups by the Parliament and the Government. Nevertheless, a recent parliamentary initiative (<b>motion</b> <b>for</b> a <b>resolution)</b> has been launched by several MPs so as to establish a register for representatives of interest groups and lobbyists who intend to lobby the MPs. The purpose of this initiative is to introduce standards of conduct and access to the National Assembly. Through the use of a register, these standards of conduct and access will enable the Assembly to identify and maintain a list of the representatives of interest groups who follow legislative activity and to supervise fully the access of those representatives to the National Assembly.

40|$|OBJECTIVE:Motion-robust multi-slab imaging of hippocampal inner {{structure}} in vivo at 7 T. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Motion {{is a crucial}} issue <b>for</b> ultra-high <b>resolution</b> imaging, such as can be achieved with 7 T MRI. An acquisition protocol was designed for imaging hippocampal inner structure at 7 T. It relies on a compromise between anatomical details visibility and robustness to motion. In order to reduce acquisition time and motion artifacts, the full slab covering the hippocampus was split into separate slabs with lower acquisition time. A robust registration approach was implemented to combine the acquired slabs within a final 3 D-consistent high-resolution slab covering the whole hippocampus. Evaluation was performed on 50 subjects overall, made of three groups of subjects acquired using three acquisition settings; it focused on three issues: visibility of hippocampal inner structure, robustness to motion artifacts and registration procedure performance. RESULTS:Overall, T 2 -weighted acquisitions with interleaved slabs proved robust. Multi-slab registration yielded high quality datasets in 96 % of the subjects, thus compatible with further analyses of hippocampal inner structure. CONCLUSION:Multi-slab acquisition and registration setting is efficient for reducing acquisition time and consequently <b>motion</b> artifacts <b>for</b> ultra-high <b>resolution</b> imaging of the inner structure of the hippocampus...|$|R

2500|$|In November 2006, Hantz Péter and Kovács Lehel, lecturers at the Babeș-Bolyai University, were {{discharged}} by {{the university}} {{after a series of}} actions started in October 2005 taken for language equality. They were campaigning for the re-organization of the Bolyai University by splitting it in two independent institutions. On 22 November 2006, the University organized an exhibition in the European Parliament, where they tried {{to give the impression that}} there are multilingual signs at the university. That day, Hantz added signs like [...] "Information" [...] and [...] "No smoking" [...] in Hungarian alongside those ones in Romanian. The two acted upon a decree permitting the use of multilingual signs, which had been decreed {{by the university}} but never put in practice, and official claims that the university is a multicultural institution with three working languages (Romanian, German and Hungarian). On 27 November 2006, the Senate voted for exclusion of the two lecturers, with 72 for and 9 against (from 2 Romanian and 7 Hungarian members) votes. The Hungarian academic community is convinced that the exclusion was not a disciplinary action, but the vote was not ethnic based. In spite of protests, the resignation out of solidarity by several Hungarian-speaking university staff, and a call by 24 Hungarian MEPs for the reinstatement of the lecturers, they remained unemployed. The parties in the Hungarian Parliament asked the university to reinstate the two professors and respect the rights of the Hungarian minority. The presidents of the five parties represented in the Hungarian Parliament signed a statement of protest. Istvan Hiller, the Education Minister of Hungary, wrote to his Romanian counterpart Mihail Hărdău, asking for his help on the issue.

40|$|Abstract—Four-dimensional {{computed}} tomography (4 D-CT) {{plays an important}} role in lung cancer treatment because of its capability in providing a comprehensive characterization of respiratory <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> high-precision radiation therapy. However, due to the inherent high-dose exposure associated with CT, dense sampling along superior–inferior direction is often not practical, thus resulting in an inter-slice thickness that is much greater than in-plane voxel resolutions. As a consequence, artifacts such as lung vessel discontinuity and partial volume effects are often observed in 4 D-CT images, which may mislead dose administration in radiation therapy. In this paper, we present a novel patch-based technique <b>for</b> <b>resolution</b> enhancement of 4 D-CT images along the superior–inferior direction.

We could show that our approach is beneficial <b>for</b> applications like <b>motion</b> tracking <b>for</b> high <b>resolution</b> brain imaging due to the non-contact acquisition of involuntary head motions with high spatial <b>resolution,</b> navigation <b>for</b> cardiac MRI due to our interpretation of the detected physiological mechanical contraction of the heart muscle and for MR safety, since we have investigated the influence of high static magnetic fields on myocardial mechanics. From our findings we could conclude, that UWB radar can serve as a navigator technique for high and ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging and can be beneficial preserving the high resolution capability of this imaging modality. Furthermore it can potentially be used to support standard ECG analysis by complementary information where sole ECG analysis fails. Further analytical investigations have proven the feasibility of this method for intracranial displacements detection and the rendition of a tumour’s contrast agent based perfusion dynamic. Beside these analytical approaches we have carried out FDTD simulations of a complex arrangement mimicking the illumination of a human torso model incorporating the geometry of the antennas applied...|$|R
