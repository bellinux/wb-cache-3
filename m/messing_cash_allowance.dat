40|$|This diploma thesis {{presents}} an {{estimation of the}} population of dependents aged 65 years and older and of nursing home residents of the same age group up to the year 2035. Dependency is defined according to the social services law of 2006 as the entitlement to a <b>cash</b> <b>allowance</b> designated for social care. Data on beneficiaries of the <b>cash</b> <b>allowance</b> were employed to estimate the future population of dependents and nursing home users. Three variants of calculations were made. They differ in the assumption about the development of dependency in the future. A sample survey was carried out to find out the age and gender structure of the nursing home population and information gained was also used to estimate the future number of nursing homes' users. The initial chapters are devoted to demographic ageing, the system of social services and the most commonly used social services by seniors. One chapter presents important features that influence demand for social services (health status, marital status, educational level and informal care). Another chapter analyses data on <b>cash</b> <b>allowances</b> provided by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R
50|$|Purniah's first {{concern was}} law and order. He {{suppressed}} the revolting Palegars (local chieftains) {{who had become}} despots.

He opened a judicial department for peoples' complaints.|$|R
25|$|The State of New Jersey {{instituted a}} <b>cash</b> meal <b>allowance</b> for its state police {{officers}} in July 1949. Before that, troopers were provided a mid-shift meal at one of several meal stations located throughout the State. The State had decided that this system was unsatisfactory, as it required troopers to leave their patrol areas unattended for extended periods of time. The new system provided troopers with a <b>cash</b> <b>allowance,</b> which troopers could use to purchase a meal at a location within their patrol area, thus making it unnecessary for them to leave the area unmonitored.|$|R
50|$|The Mobility Allowance - {{now called}} the {{mobility}} component of Disability Living Allowance - introduced by the Government in 1976 broke the mould in giving help regardless of ability to drive. It also signalled the Government's commitment to giving disabled people choice {{in the form of}} a <b>cash</b> <b>allowance,</b> rather than imposing certain types of vehicles on them.|$|R

50|$|As {{many of the}} Aboriginals {{lived in}} huts made from {{corrugated}} iron, Dixon organised the local men to build houses to replace them. Local stone was chipped by hand with the locals given rations while they worked on their own home with an additional <b>cash</b> <b>allowance</b> when they worked on some one else’s. Within two years every family lived in a stone house.|$|R
50|$|The award {{carries with}} it a <b>cash</b> <b>allowance</b> and, in some cases, a lump sum cash award. This has been a rather {{controversial}} issue throughout {{the life of the}} decoration.

In addition, many states have established individual pension rewards for the recipients of the decoration.|$|R

5000|$|In 1935 Panth Piploda was {{separated}} from Bombay. Panth-Piploda was a small tract of territory comprising only 10½ villages, which were held by five different thakurs. In [...] 1765, the Peshwa of the Maratha Empire assigned the revenues from the villages {{to the family of}} Sambhaji Attaji, a Deshastha Brahmin. This ruling family was later known as the family of the Khandekar Pandits. The arrangement made by the Peshwa was respected by the British when they took over Panth Piploda from the Marathas in 1817. The ruling family did not have any proprietary rights whatever in these villages and were mere tankadars (recipients of the <b>cash</b> <b>allowance).</b> This <b>cash</b> <b>allowance</b> was paid to them by the Political Agent in Malwa Agency who realized it from the thakurs in whose territories the villages lay. The estate was managed by a Superintendent {{under the control of the}} Political Agent with headquarters at Kharua (also spelled as Kharwa). In 1936, there were two guaranteed tankadars, who received payments totaling Rs. 46,000. It became a province of British India in 1942. On 15 Aug 1947 it became part of independent India.|$|R

50|$|After the Kristallnacht pogroms on 10 November 1938, many {{refugees}} who {{fled to the}} Netherlands were accommodated in camps, and a Camp Division was formed. The representation {{of the interests of}} these people, provision of clothing, a <b>cash</b> <b>allowance,</b> and advice on possible emigration was the task of the Camp Division. When the Dutch government decided to build a Central Refugee Camp (Dutch: Centraal Vluchtelingenkamp) near Westerbork, the CJV was required to raise more than 1 million guilders to underwrite the expenses of operating the camp.|$|R

VC/NVA fighters received a daily <b>cash</b> <b>allowance</b> for food which they might sometimes use in local markets. They also foraged widely including hunting. Lacking refrigeration, most food was prepared fresh. Rice was the staple. The ingenious Hoang Cam stove was used to prepare meals without flame or smoke being detected, incorporating a long exhaust trench that allowed smoke to gradually disperse into the jungle far away from the actual stove.|$|R
