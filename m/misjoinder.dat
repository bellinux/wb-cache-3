5000|$|According to FRCP Rule 21, <b>Misjoinder</b> {{of parties}} {{is not a}} ground for dismissing an action. On motion or on its own, the court may at any time, on just terms, add or drop a party. The court may also sever any claim against a party.|$|E
50|$|Alternative {{pleading}} is permitted, so a {{party may}} plead inconsistent facts as to different parties, {{and leave it}} to the jury to determine which proposed set of facts were the true facts of the case, so long as all causes of action arise from the same transaction or occurrence. If an unrelated claim is joined, however, this claim will be stricken as a <b>misjoinder.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A man of few words, he {{nevertheless}} {{came down}} hard if anyone deliberately or through ignorance tried to mislead the court. He loved the moot point and relished a fine argument. I remember an appeal I {{did for a}} client sentenced to six years jail, inter alia, for importing a-go-go dancers {{and it was on}} the sole ground of <b>misjoinder</b> of charges. Hardly five minutes into my opening address, the Chief in his usual soft, calm voice asked the Deputy Public Prosecutor if he was seriously upholding the conviction. It was a rare occasion when that gentleman was bereft of words! Although he showed a somewhat stern demeanour in court, apart from his prodigious memory, he had, as others have said, a sensitive and kind heart.—Geoffrey Abisheganaden, lawyer ...|$|E
40|$|This Article explores, and {{ultimately}} embraces, a new {{exception to the}} complete diversity rule in removal cases: the doctrine of procedural <b>misjoinder.</b> We argue that the doctrine offers federal courts a vital tool with which to police joinder gamesmanship. Absent this power, plaintiffs may preclude defendant access to federal courts by the relatively simple expedient of joining in state court largely unrelated claims against or on behalf of non-diverse parties. The resulting lawsuit thus fails the complete diversity test, rendering such cases removal-proof. Like fraudulent joinder, the long-standing practice of ignoring non-diverse parties against whom no valid claim may be asserted, the doctrine of procedural <b>misjoinder</b> would permit federal courts to disregard any diversity-destroying parties who have been improperly added to the state lawsuit. Because access to federal courts is at stake, we believe federal courts should adopt this new doctrine, applying federal joinder standards to test the legitimacy of plaintiffs’ party alignments before denying removal jurisdiction...|$|E

40|$|Courts {{apply to}} wage rights cases an {{aggressive}} scrutiny {{that not only}} disadvantages low-wage workers, but is fundamentally incorrect on the law. Rule 23 class actions automatically cover all potential members if the court grants plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 class certification motion. But for certain employment rights cases [...] mainly wage claims but also age discrimination and gender equal pay claims [...] 29 U. S. C. § 216 (b) allows not class actions but 2 ̆ 2 collective actions 2 ̆ 2 covering just those opting in affirmatively. Yet courts in collective actions assume a gatekeeper role {{just as they do}} in Rule 23 class actions, disallowing many actions by requiring a certification motion proving strict commonality among members. This Article argues that conditioning § 216 (b) collective actions on certification motions proving commonality is incorrect. Section 216 (b) is not an opt-in version of Rule 23; it is a liberalized form of simple Rule 20 joinder, which permits joint suit whenever claims share one common issue and address related events. No text authorizes any § 216 (b) certification inquiry, nor is judicial gatekeeping justified by economic logic: Rule 23 classes present principal-agent and asymmetric information problems because lead plaintiffs may inadequately represent unengaged members, but all § 216 (b) collective actions members are full plaintiffs with individual claims, obviating the need for judicial scrutiny. Wage rights cases commonly are high-impact challenges to entire industry pay practices, seeking millions in unpaid wages for thousands of workers. Especially for low-wage workers, disallowing collective actions ends the claims; individual suits are cost-prohibitive. Even when collective actions proceed, certification motions yield cost and delay, thwarting claims and deterring attorneys. Courts should presumptively allow collective actions whenever workers for the same employer press the same statutory claims. Defendants should bear the burden of challenging collective actions in a Rule 21 <b>misjoinder</b> or Rule 12 dismissal motion. This Article provides two explanations for such pervasive judicial error. In a complex, once-obscure field, courts heavily relied upon early precedent that proved incorrect, yielding path-dependent 2 ̆ 2 lock-in 2 ̆ 2 of bad law. Less charitably, courts 2 ̆ 7 mishandling of collective actions is just another example of federal courts erecting procedural hurdles to rights-vindicating litigation...|$|E
