25|$|The {{third major}} {{industry}} in West Chester {{in the late}} 1800s was the Sharples Separator Works. Philip M. Sharples built a shop in April 1881 and built <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>things</b> made out of wood or metal such as farm machinery and steam engines. He began manufacturing cream separators in 1883, which became his most profitable product. In 1889, he {{moved into a new}} factory on Maple Avenue that eventually employed 600 workers and produced 3,700 cream separators annually. After being sued in 1893, Sharples acquired a patent for his cream separator in 1897. Sharples added innovations like electric lighting, fire alarms, and steam whistles and helped transform West Chester into a major industrial hub. By the 1900 census, West Chester's population had expanded to 9,524 and was the largest town in Chester County with approximately 10 percent of its population.|$|E

He even tells Wheezer {{that he will have}} no father anymore. His mother might either remarry and give him a stepfather and states that his step father beats him regularly. He also says that maybe his mother will throw him into an orphanage and not want him anymore.|$|R
25|$|As the {{awakening}} movement gained momentum, its goals matured and shifted from promoting modesty and Islamic identity towards {{more of a}} political stance in terms of retaining support for Islamic nationalism and to resist western influences. Today the hijab means <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>things</b> for different people. For Islamic women who choose to wear the hijab {{it allows them to}} retain their modesty, morals and freedom of choice. They choose to cover because they believe it is liberating and allows them to avoid harassment. Many people (both Muslim and non-Muslim) are against the wearing of the hijab and argue that the hijab causes issues with gender relations, works to silence and repress women both physically and metaphorically, and have many other problems with the practice. This difference in opinions has generated a plethora of discussion on the subject, both emotional and academic, which continues today.|$|E

He critiques various claims that broken bones represent evidence of cannibalism, both in Iron Age Yorkshire {{and in the case}} of Peking Man, maintaining that these breakages could represent <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>things</b> rather than cannibalism. He then moves on to look at North American examples, including those from the Pueblo period in the Southwestern United States and among the Iroquois in the country's northeast, in both instances critiquing an interpretation of socially sanctioned cannibalism.|$|E
