5|$|The {{terminus}} of the Rother Navigation {{was on a}} side stream, at {{the southern}} edge of Midhurst. There was a wharf and basin, close to a road which is still called The Wharf, and an ashlar bridge crosses the navigation between the wharf and the junction with the main river. It was built in 1794, and was restored in 1977 to commemorate the silver jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The first lock was near Little Topham farm. There was a lock cut across a loop to the north. Costers Brook, which flows north from springs near Cocking, and then alongside the river for a short distance, joins below the site of the lock. The bridge at South Ambersham was built of stone rubble in 1791, with a <b>main</b> <b>arch</b> across the navigation and a smaller arch to the north, which has been repaired with brick. Moorland Lock was on a straight cut across a large meander to the south, close to Moorlands Farm. Lodsbridge Lock also bypasses a meander to the south, which fed Lodsbridge Mill. The mill building dates from the eighteenth century, and has been converted into a house. The seventeenth-century timber-framed mill house is also a listed building. There was a motte castle immediately to the south of the mill. A modern timber yard and saw mill is located {{to the north of the}} lock site, and Lods Bridge, which carries a minor road over the river, dates from the construction of the navigation. The River Lod joins on the north bank just below the bridge.|$|E
25|$|The new {{bridge is}} a few metres further down the river than the old bridge. The bridge was {{installed}} on 18 December 2007, and was made by Cornish Concrete, a company based near Truro. The <b>main</b> <b>arch</b> is made from reinforced concrete, with metal railings.|$|E
25|$|The {{outside of}} the <b>main</b> <b>arch</b> is {{decorated}} with rolling phytomorphic acanthus, which rise to the center forming a small conopy with the royal coat-of-arms, crowned with a garland and strut cross of the Order of Christ, dividing the capstone. The internal archivolt, is carved with flourishes of vegetal elements that extend {{to the base of}} the inner archivolt.|$|E

25|$|The {{mausoleum}} is cubic with chamfered edges. On {{the long}} sides, a massive pishtaq, or vaulted archway frames an arch-shaped doorway, {{with a similar}} arch-shaped balcony above. These main arches extend above the roof the building by use of an integrated facade. To {{either side of the}} <b>main</b> <b>arch,</b> additional pishtaqs are stacked above and below. This motif of stacked pishtaqs is replicated on the chamfered corner areas. The design is completely uniform and consistent on all sides of the building.|$|E
25|$|Prince Albert appears {{within the}} <b>main</b> <b>arch</b> above the twin entrances, and Queen Victoria above the frame around the arches and entrance, sculpted by Alfred Drury. These façades {{surround}} four levels of galleries. Other areas designed by Webb include the Entrance Hall and Rotunda, the East and West Halls, the areas {{occupied by the}} shop and Asian Galleries, and the Costume Gallery. The interior makes much use of marble in the entrance hall and flanking staircases, although the galleries as originally designed were white with restrained classical detail and mouldings, very much {{in contrast to the}} elaborate decoration of the Victorian galleries, although much of this decoration was removed in the early 20th century.|$|E
500|$|Several {{historic}} bridges {{cross the}} Rogue between Gold Hill and Grants Pass. The Gold Hill Bridge, designed by McCullough and built in 1927, {{is the only}} open-spandrel, barrel-arch bridge in Oregon. Its <b>main</b> <b>arch</b> is [...] long. Also designed by McCullough, the Rock Point Bridge carries U.S. Route 99 and Oregon Route 234 over the river near the unincorporated community of Rock Point. The [...] structure has a single arch. Built in 1920 for $48,400, it replaced a wooden bridge at the same site. The bridge was closed in September 2009 for repairs to its deck and railings. The project is expected to cost $3.9million.|$|E

On October 10, 2013, the bascule span jammed and became stuck {{in the open position}} when a roller under the maintenance walkway seized, closing the bridge for approximately eleven hours.|$|R
50|$|The <b>main</b> <b>arches</b> had spans of 100 ft; 160 ft; 144 ft; and 100 ft. At {{either end}} of the viaduct were sets of three smaller spans of 20 ft. The <b>main</b> <b>arches</b> were semicircular with the {{exception}} of the main 160 ft span, which was a circular segment, spanning 160 ft with a rise of 72 ft. The three main piers and one of the arch abutments were founded on bedrock, the river pier required excavation to a depth of 24 ft below the river bed to obtain that footing. One arch abutment was founded on 14 ft long, 10 in diameter scotch fir piles, spaced at 3 ft. Above the first 5 ft the piers contained voids to minimise mass.|$|R

2500|$|Construction {{began on}} 25 April 1956. The {{contractors}} {{for the first}} phase of work, Leonard Fairclough of Adlington, cleared the ground and constructed the foundations for the piers. The contract for the second phase, the building of the <b>main</b> <b>arch</b> and the side arches, was given to Dorman Long of Middlesbrough who sub-contracted the building of the bridge deck, viaduct and roadworks to Leonard Fairclough. Building of the bridge itself began in March 1958 and the side spans were completed by November 1959. The <b>main</b> <b>arch</b> was built by cantilevering steelwork from the side spans until it met in the middle in November 1960. The carriageway was suspended from the arch by 48lock-coil wire ropes. [...] From February 1960, approach roads and viaducts were being built {{on both sides of the}} river; the total length of viaduct constructed was [...] The approaches on the Runcorn side blocked the Bridgewater Canal at Waterloo Bridge and the line of locks leading down to the Mersey were filled in. [...] The bridge was officially opened on 21July 1961 by Princess Alexandra.|$|E

2500|$|The Silver Jubilee Bridge, [...] "Runcorn-Widnes Bridge" [...] or Runcorn Bridge {{crosses the}} River Mersey and the Manchester Ship Canal at Runcorn Gap between Runcorn and Widnes in Halton, England. It is a through arch bridge with a <b>main</b> <b>arch</b> span of 361 yards (330 m). It was opened in 1961 as a {{replacement}} for the Widnes-Runcorn Transporter Bridge, and was initially known simply as the Runcorn Bridge or Runcorn–Widnes Bridge. In 1975–77 it was widened, after which it was given its official name in honour of the Queen's Silver Jubilee. It carries the A533 road and a cantilevered footway. The bridge is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated GradeII listed building.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1852, {{determined}} to get a bridge built at the Three Sisters, Georgetown city officials commissioned a study from engineer Charles Ellet. Ellet proposed a single-span bridge at the Three Sisters whose <b>main</b> <b>arch</b> {{would be more than}} [...] long and whose deck would be [...] above the water. Stone abutments [...] high on the Georgetown side would arch over the C Canal and connect the C Canal abutment to the high ground. [...] A single [...] high stone abutment on the Virginia side would tie the bridge to the palisades there. Although the Mayor of the District of Columbia also supported this plan and legislation was introduced in the United States Congress to give it effect, the bill was not acted on and the bridge never built.|$|E
2500|$|The front {{facade of}} the {{structure}} features a huge screen with yellow limestone arches, built {{during the reign of}} Iltutmish. The <b>main</b> <b>arch</b> is nearly 60 feet high, and is flanked by six smaller arches. The arches have small rectangular panels for passage of daylight, similar to the ones found in early Arabian mosques. The archway features Kufic and Tughra inscriptions and quotations from Koran, and is reminiscent of Islamic architecture from Ghazni and Turkistan. Some of the carvings feature Arabesque floral and foliate patterns; their geometric symmetry is reminiscent of Persian tilework. Their filigree sets them apart from Hindu-style carvings in the same building. The Hindu patterns are similar to the ones seen in the 10th century structures at Nagda and the 11th century Sas-Bahu Temple at Gwalior. The 19th century American traveler John Fletcher Hurst described the screen as [...] "a gem of great renown throughout the Mohammedan world." ...|$|E

The <b>main</b> <b>arch</b> span is [...] long and rises [...] The bridge has an internal spandrel wall structure that contains nine additional smaller arches, which are concealed from view by exterior stone sidewalls. At {{the time of its}} construction in 1864, the main span was the longest single-span masonry arch in the world. It retained that distinction until the opening of the [...] span of the Pont Adolphe Bridge in Luxembourg in 1903. Previously, that honour had gone to the Grosvenor Bridge which crosses the River Dee in Chester, England and which was opened by the thirteen-year-old Princess Victoria (five years before becoming Queen) in October 1832. Visually, the similarities between the Union Arch Bridge and the Grosvenor Bridge are remarkable.|$|E
2500|$|The {{eventual}} {{design of}} the bridge called for a graceful arch that soars [...] above the Kill Van Kull and supports a road bed for [...] without intermediary piers, though two viaducts {{at either end of}} the main span would allow the roadway to rise up to the height of the arch. In particular, the Port Richmond viaduct was [...] long and the Bayonne viaduct was [...] long, supported by piers that ranged from [...] tall. The total length of the bridge is [...] with a mid-span clearance above the water of [...] in order to make room for the United States Navy's tallest ships at the time. The arch resembles a parabola, but is made up of 40 linear segments. The {{design of the}} steel arch is influenced by the Hell Gate Bridge designed by Ammann's mentor, Gustav Lindenthal. Gilbert had designed an ornamental granite sheathing over the steelwork as part of the original proposal, but as in the case of the George Washington Bridge, the stone sheathing was eliminated in order to lower the cost of the bridge due to material shortages during the Great Depression, leaving the steel trusses exposed on both bridges. It was the first bridge to employ manganese steel for the <b>main</b> <b>arch</b> ribs and rivets.|$|E

60|$|The ducal palace has two {{principal}} façades; one towards the sea, the other towards the Piazzetta. The seaward side, and, {{as far as}} the seventh <b>main</b> <b>arch</b> inclusive, the Piazzetta side, is work of {{the early part of the}} fourteenth century, some of it perhaps even earlier; while the rest of the Piazzetta side is of the fifteenth. The difference in age has been gravely disputed by the Venetian antiquaries, who have examined many documents on the subject, and quoted some which they never examined. I have myself collated most of the written documents, and one document more, to which the Venetian antiquaries never thought of referring,--the masonry of the palace itself.|$|E
6000|$|... § III. In the {{simplest}} doors the cross lintel is of wood only, and glass or bars occupy the space above, a very frequent form in Venice. In more elaborate doors the cross lintel is of stone, and the filling sometimes of brick, sometimes of stone, very often a grand single stone {{being used to}} close the entire space: the space thus filled is called the Tympanum. In large doors the cross lintel is too long to bear the great incumbent weight of this stone filling without support; it is, therefore, carried by a pier in the centre; and two valves are used, fitted to the rectangular spaces {{on each side of}} the pier. In the most elaborate examples of this condition, each of these secondary doorways has an arch heading, a cross lintel, and a triangular filling or tympanum of its own, all subordinated to the <b>main</b> <b>arch</b> above.|$|E
