The refining effect of AZ 80 alloy was the best when the electromagnetic vibration frequency, current intensities and treatment time were 15 Hz, 70 A and 60 s, respectively.

40|$|Increasing the {{efficiency}} of rough machining operations can produce significant productivity improvement in mould and die making {{because most of the}} metal is removed in the roughing stage. In this paper, a high-efficiency 2. 5 -dimensional rough milling strategy for <b>mould</b> <b>core</b> machining is presented. The strategy consists of three different tool paths. The first tool path is generated {{on the basis of the}} convex hull boundary of a machining region. Owing to the absence of concave tool path segments, the convex hull based tool path can eliminate the chip load fluctuation problem encountered in corner cutting. The second tool path is an enhanced unidirectional straight-line tool path, which has the virtue of maintaining a steady cutting resistance throughout. The large staircases left behind by these two tool paths are refined by using the third tool path which is a contour-parallel tool path that cuts the <b>mould</b> <b>core</b> layer by layer in an upward manner. After applying these three tool paths, the stock material left on the <b>mould</b> <b>core</b> surface can be post-processed by the subsequent finish milling operation. A case study is illustrated to demonstrate the practicality of the presented rough milling strategy. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} and manufacturing of ejection systems in injection moulds {{can be a}} complex task, particularly when the parts have long ejection paths. During the injection of tubular- or box shape parts, the shrinkage is constrained by the mould. The mouldings shrink against the core, inserts or pins, thus, during ejection, {{it will be necessary}} to overcome the frictional forces resulting from the shrinkage. Understanding the ejection forces could be a useful contribution to improve ejection systems designs and guarantee the structural integrity of the mouldings. This information could be even more useful in the processing of thin-walled parts which are more prone to damage during ejection. Frictional forces could be decreased by using specific coatings in the <b>mould</b> <b>core</b> and by optimization of the processing parameters.

The software is fully ‘ 32 -Bit’, operating on ‘Windows’ platforms, and uses graphical methods for input and output operations. The two-dimensional geometry of the mould is supplied using AutoCAD 14 and ‘Active-X Automation’. The analysis programs were written using ‘Fortran PowerStation’ and the user interface using ‘Visual Basic’. To employ the optimisation process the ‘Boundary Element Method’ was used to predict the temperature profile throughout the mould. This method is compared to an analytical procedure and the “Finite Element Method”, by analysing a simple benchmark problem.
