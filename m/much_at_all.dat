5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate the Church of God with Signs and Wonders, a church where the Bible is read literally, and punishment is dealt deftly, after a small town church {{is the site of}} a number of ritualistic-like murders. But soon the agents realize that the difference between the peaceful religious and the fanatics may not be very <b>much</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} no {{agreed-upon}} scientific method for making experiments reproducible. Indeed, many alchemists included in their methods irrelevant {{information such as}} {{the timing of the}} tides or the phases of the moon. The esoteric nature and codified vocabulary of alchemy appeared to be more useful in concealing the fact that they could not be sure of very <b>much</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> As early as the 14th century, cracks seemed to grow in the facade of alchemy; and people became sceptical. Clearly, there needed to be a scientific method where experiments can be repeated by other people, and results needed to be reported in a clear language that laid out both what is known and unknown.|$|E

He called the music artificial, {{repetitive}} and uninspired. Don Shewey from Rolling Stone commented that [...] "At first, it [...] doesn't sound like <b>much</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Then you notice its one distinguishing feature, a girlish hiccup that the singer uses over and over until it's irritating as hell. Finally, you get hooked, and you start {{looking forward to that}} silly little catch in her voice." [...] Author J.

2500|$|The confederational {{framework}} of Sparta's {{relationship with her}} allies was really an artificial one, since it attempted to bring together cities {{that had never been}} able to agree on <b>much</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> in the past. Such was the case with the cities of Tegea and Mantinea, which re-allied in the Arcadian confederacy. The Mantineans received the support of the Athenians, and the Tegeans that of the Thebans. [...] In 362 BC, Epaminondas led a Theban army against a coalition of Athenian, Spartan, Elisian, Mantinean and Achean forces. Battle was joined at Mantinea. [...] The Thebans prevailed, but this triumph was short-lived, for Epaminondas died in the battle, stating that [...] "I bequeath to Thebes two daughters, the victory of Leuctra and the victory at Mantinea".|$|E

[...] In June 2016, Sophie Dainty from Digital Spy included Gavin in a list of 10 soap opera villains she hoped would receive their comeuppance, opining that Gavin had not made [...] "Archie Mitchell look like a care bear" [...] as promised, adding that the fact that [...] "he hasn't really done very <b>much</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> [...] leaves us feeling a little on edge", adding that [...] "until he's humbled for good, we are fearful for those that have 'wronged' him." ...|$|E

So it might be a piece of chocolate or it might be a mouthful of a cheesecake or something like that." [...] In the aftermath of the 60 Minutes broadcast, Kathy Marks noted in The Independent, [...] "Visitors to her large villa in the prosperous Chapel Hill area of Brisbane invariably find her refrigerator generously stocked with food, all of it destined, she insists, for the stomach of her second husband, Jeff Ferguson, a convicted fraudster".|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] led CBS Records to renew Jones' {{recording}} contract and sparked {{new interest in}} the singer. He {{was the subject of}} an hour-and-a-quarter-long HBO television special entitled George Jones: With a Little Help from His Friends, which saw him performing songs with Waylon Jennings, Elvis Costello, Tanya Tucker, and Tammy Wynette, among others. Jones continued drinking and using cocaine, appearing at various awards shows to accept honors for [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] arguably inebriated, like when he performed [...] "I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool" [...] with Barbara Mandrell at the 1981 Country Music Association Awards. [...] He was involved in several high-speed car chases with police, which were reported on the national news, and one arrest was filmed by a local TV crew; the video, which is widely available online, offers a glimpse into Jones' alter ego when drinking, as he argues with the police officer and lunges at the camera man. Conversely, when sober, Jones was known to be friendly and down to earth, even shy. [...] In a 1994 article on Jones, Nick Tosches remarked that when he first interviewed the singer in April 1976, [...] "One could readily believe the accounts by those who had known him for years: that he had not changed <b>much</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> and that he had been impervious to fame and fortune." [...] In an unusually unguarded self-appraisal in 1981, the singer told Mark Rose of The Village Voice, [...] "I don't show a lot of affection. [...] I have probably been a very unliked person among family, like somebody who was heartless. [...] I saved it all for the songs. [...] I didn't know you were supposed to show that love person to person. [...] I guess I always wanted to, but I didn't know how. [...] The only way I could would be {{to do it in a}} song." [...] Years later he commented to The Christian Broadcasting Network's Scott Ross about himself, [...] "I think you're mad at yourself, I think that you're sayin' to yourself 'You don't deserve this. [...] You don't deserve those fans. [...] You don't deserve makin' this money.' [...] And you're mad at yourself. [...] And you beat up on yourself by drinkin' and losing friends that won't put up with that...It's just one terrible big mess you make out of your life." [...] In 1982, Jones recorded the album A Taste of Yesterday's Wine with Merle Haggard; [...] while Jones, in the wake of his condition, appeared underweight on the album cover, his singing was flawless. [...] His run of hits also continued in the early 1980s, with the singer charting [...] "I'm Not Ready Yet", [...] "Same Ole Me" [...] (backed by the Oak Ridge Boys)", [...] "Still Doin' Time", [...] "Tennessee Whiskey", [...] "We Didn't See a Thing" [...] (a duet with Ray Charles), and [...] "I Always Get Lucky with You", which was Jones' last number one in 1984.|$|E

6000|$|In college {{forms and}} returns, and suchlike documents, she would {{describe}} herself as [...] "Church of England." [...] She had been baptized {{according to the}} usages of that body, but she had hitherto evaded confirmation into it, and although it is a large, wealthy, and powerful organization with many minds to serve it, it had never succeeded in getting into her quick and apprehensive intelligence any lucid and persuasive conception of what it considered God and the universe were up to with her. It had failed to catch her attention and state itself to her. A number of humorous and other writers and the general trend of talk around her, and perhaps her own shrewd little observation of superficial things, had, on the other hand, created a fairly definite belief in her that it wasn't {{as a matter of}} fact up to very <b>much</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> that what it said wasn't said with that absolute honesty which is a logical necessity in every religious authority, and that its hierarchy had all sorts of political and social considerations confusing its treatment of her immortal soul....|$|E
6000|$|She {{had evidently}} been the wit and joy {{of a large}} circle of schoolfellows, and this style had become a second nature with her. It made her very {{delightful}} to me in that quiet place. Her customary walk even {{had a sort of}} hello! in it. Her chief preoccupation in life was, I believe, to make my uncle laugh, and when by some new nickname, some new quaintness or absurdity, she achieved that end, she was, behind a mask of sober amazement, the happiest woman on earth. My uncle's laugh when it did come, I must admit was, as Baedeker says, [...] "rewarding." [...] It began with gusty blowings and snortings, and opened into a clear [...] "Ha ha!" [...] but in fullest development it included, in those youthful days, falling about anyhow and doubling up tightly, and whackings of the stomach, and tears and cries of anguish. I never in my life heard my uncle laugh to his maximum except at her; he was commonly too much in earnest for that, and he didn't laugh <b>much</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> to my knowledge, after those early years. Also she threw things at him to an enormous extent in her resolve to keep things lively in spite of Wimblehurst; sponges out of stock she threw, cushions, balls of paper, clean washing, bread; and once up the yard when they thought that I and the errand boy and the diminutive maid of all work were safely out of the way, she smashed a boxful of eight-ounce bottles I had left to drain, assaulting my uncle with a new soft broom. Sometimes she would shy things at me--but not often. There seemed always laughter round and about her--all three of us would share hysterics at times--and on one occasion the two of them came home from church shockingly ashamed of themselves, because of a storm of mirth during the sermon. The vicar, it seems, had tried to blow his nose with a black glove as well as the customary pocket-handkerchief. And afterwards she had picked up her own glove by the finger, and looking innocently but intently sideways, had suddenly by this simple expedient exploded my uncle altogether. We had it all over again at dinner.|$|E

6000|$|I haven't {{told you}} how I found Alice when I last saw her. She is now in very good form--still going out, I hear from her, in the mild moments, and feeling very easy and even jolly about her Leamington winter. My being away {{is a sign of}} her really good symptoms. She was wüthend after the London police, in {{connection}} with the Whitechapel murders, to a degree that almost constituted robust health. I have seen a great many (that is, more than usual) Frenchmen in London this year: they bring me notes of introduction--and the other day, the night before coming away, I entertained at dinner (at a club,) the French Ambassador at Madrid (Paul Cambon), Xavier Charmes of the French Foreign Office, G. du Maurier, and the wonderful little Jusserand, the chargé d'affaires in London, who is a great friend of mine, and to oblige and relieve whom it was that I invited the two other diplomatists, his friends, whom he had rather helplessly on his hands. THERE is the real difference--a gulf from the English (or the American) to the Frenchman, and vice versâ (still more); and not from the Englishman to the American. The Frenchmen I see all seem to me wonderful the first time--but not so <b>much,</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> the second.--But I must finish this without having touched any of the sympathetic things I meant to say to you about your place, your work on it, Alice's prowesses as a country lady, the children's vie champêtre, etc. Aunt Kate, after her visit to you, praised all these things to us with profusion and evident sincerity. I wish I could see them--but the day seems far.--I haven't lain on the ground for so many years that I feel as if I had spent them up in a balloon. Next summer I shall come here--I mean to Switzerland, for which my taste has revived. I am full of gratulation on your enlarged classes, chances of reading, etc., and on your prospect of keeping the invalid child this winter. Give my tender love to Alice. You are entering the period of keen suspense about Cleveland, and I share it even here. I have lately begun to receive and read the Nation after a long interval--and it seems to me very rough.
