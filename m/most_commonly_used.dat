50|$|The length between I-frames {{is known}} as the group of {{pictures}} (GOP) size. MPEG-1 <b>most</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>uses</b> a GOP size of 15-18. i.e. 1 I-frame for every 14-17 non-I-frames (some combination of P- and B- frames). With more intelligent encoders, GOP size is dynamically chosen, up to some pre-selected maximum limit.|$|R
