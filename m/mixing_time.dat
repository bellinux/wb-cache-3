25|$|The mean oceanic <b>mixing</b> <b>time</b> {{is thought}} to be {{approximately}} 1,600 years. If a given element in the ocean stays in the ocean, on average, longer than the oceanic <b>mixing</b> <b>time,</b> then that element is assumed to be homogeneously spread throughout the ocean. As a result, because the major salts have a residence time that is longer than 1,600 years, the ratio of major salts {{is thought to}} be unchanging across the ocean. This constant ratio {{is often referred to as}} Forchhammer's principle or the principle of constant proportions.|$|E
25|$|In {{probabilistic}} combinatorics, {{the questions}} are of the following type: what is {{the probability of a}} certain property for a random discrete object, such as a random graph? For instance, what is the average number of triangles in a random graph? Probabilistic methods are also used to determine the existence of combinatorial objects with certain prescribed properties (for which explicit examples might be difficult to find), simply by observing that the probability of randomly selecting an object with those properties is greater than 0. This approach (often referred to as the probabilistic method) proved highly effective in applications to extremal combinatorics and graph theory. A closely related area is the study of finite Markov chains, especially on combinatorial objects. Here again probabilistic tools are used to estimate the <b>mixing</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{dynamical}} behaviors of impulsive stochastic reaction-diffusion neural networks (ISRDNNs) with <b>mixed</b> <b>time</b> delays. By using a well-known L-operator differential inequality with <b>mixed</b> <b>time</b> delays and combining with the Lyapunov-Krasovkii functional approach, {{as well as}} linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, some novel sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the existence, uniqueness, and global exponential stability of the periodic solutions for ISRDNNs with <b>mixed</b> <b>time</b> delays in the mean square sense. The obtained sufficient conditions depend on the reaction-diffusion terms. The results of this paper are new and improve some of the previously known results.

2500|$|Protein {{precipitate}} formation {{occurs in a}} stepwise process. [...] First, a precipitating agent is added and the solution is steadily mixed. [...] Mixing causes the precipitant and protein to collide. Enough <b>mixing</b> <b>time</b> is required for molecules to diffuse across the fluid eddies. [...] Next, proteins undergo a nucleation phase, where submicroscopic sized protein aggregates, or particles, are generated. Growth of these particles is under Brownian diffusion control. Once the particles reach a critical size (0.1 µm to 10 µm for high and low shear fields, respectively), by diffusive addition of individual protein molecules to it, they continue to grow by colliding into each other and sticking or flocculating. This phase occurs at a slower rate. During the final step, called aging in a shear field, the precipitate particles repeatedly collide and stick, then break apart, until a stable mean particle size is reached, which is dependent upon individual proteins. The mechanical strength of the protein particles correlates with {{the product of the}} mean shear rate and the aging time, which is known as the Camp number. Aging helps particles withstand the fluid shear forces encountered in pumps and centrifuge feed zones without reducing in size.|$|E

40|$|When {{simulating}} {{the formation}} and life cycle of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) with chemical transport models, it is often assumed that organic molecules are well mixed within SOA particles on the timescale of 1  h. While this assumption has been debated vigorously in the literature, the issue remains unresolved {{in part due to}} a lack of information on the <b>mixing</b> <b>times</b> within SOA particles as a function of both temperature and relative humidity. Using laboratory data, meteorological fields, and a chemical transport model, we estimated how often <b>mixing</b> <b>times</b> are [*][*] 0. 5  µg m − 3 at the surface). Next, as a starting point to quantify how often <b>mixing</b> <b>times</b> of organic molecules are [*]<[*] 1  h within α -pinene SOA generated using low, atmospherically relevant mass concentrations, we developed a temperature-independent parameterization for viscosity using the room-temperature viscosity data for α -pinene SOA generated in the laboratory using a mass concentration of [*]∼[*] 70  µg m − 3. Based on this temperature-independent parameterization, <b>mixing</b> <b>times</b> within α -pinene SOA are [*]<[*] 1  h for 27 and 19. 5  % of the occurrences in the PBL during January and July, respectively, when concentrations are significant. However, associated with these conclusions are several caveats, and due to these caveats we are unable to make strong conclusions about how often <b>mixing</b> <b>times</b> of organic molecules are [*]<[*] 1  h within α -pinene SOA generated using low, atmospherically relevant mass concentrations. Finally, a parameterization for viscosity of anthropogenic SOA as a function of temperature and RH was developed using sucrose–water data. Based on this parameterization, and assuming sucrose is a good proxy for anthropogenic SOA, 70 and 83  % of the <b>mixing</b> <b>times</b> within anthropogenic SOA in the PBL are [*]<[*] 1  h for January and July, respectively, when concentrations are significant.

5000|$|More precisely, a {{fundamental}} result about Markov chains {{is that a}} finite state irreducible aperiodic chain has a unique stationary distribution &pi; and, regardless of the initial state, the time-t distribution of the chain converges to &pi; as t tends to infinity. <b>Mixing</b> <b>time</b> refers to any of several variant formalizations of the idea: how large must t be until the time-t distribution is approximately &pi; ? One variant, variation distance <b>mixing</b> <b>time,</b> {{is defined as the}} smallest t such thatfor all subsets A of states and all initial states. This is the sense in which [...] proved that the number of riffle shuffles needed to mix an ordinary 52 card deck is 7. Mathematical theory focuses on how mixing times change {{as a function of the}} size of the structure underlying the chain. For an n-card deck, the number of riffle shuffles needed grows as 1.5 log (n) / log (2). The most developed theory concerns randomized algorithms for #P-Complete algorithmic counting problems such as the number of graph colorings of a given n vertex graph. Such problems can, for sufficiently large number of colors, be answered using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method and showing that the <b>mixing</b> <b>time</b> grows only as n log (n) [...] This example and the shuffling example possess the rapid mixing property, that the <b>mixing</b> <b>time</b> grows at most polynomially fast in log (number of states of the chain). Tools for proving rapid mixing include arguments based on conductance and the method of coupling. In broader uses of the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, rigorous justification of simulation results would require a theoretical bound on <b>mixing</b> <b>time,</b> and many interesting practical cases have resisted such theoretical analysis.|$|E
