40|$|A {{low cost}} DNA <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>marker</b> was {{produced}} by a marker primer-directed synthetic method using pGEM-T Easy vector as the DNA template. Seven primers were used to amplify eight different DNA fragments, which were 150, 300, 375, 500, 700, 1, 000, 1, 200 and 1, 625 bp, from bacterial culture containing pGEM-T Easy vector. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) for all marker loci required the same optimal annealing temperature, which allowed all the PCR {{to be completed in}} a single run.

40|$|We {{have further}} {{characterized}} osteoclast activating factor (OAF) using a bioassay for bone resorption which utilizes {{the release of}} previously incorporated 45 Ca from fetal rat long bones in organ culture. When supernatant media from activated leukocyte cultures were concentrated on Amicon PM 10 membranes (assigned <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> cutoff 10, 000 daltons) and chromatographed on Sephadex G- 50 columns, the bone-resorbing activity eluted between the <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>markers</b> chymotrypsinogen (25, 000 daltons) and cytochrome c (12, 500 daltons). This peak of biological activity has been called big OAF. When filtrates from the PM 10 membranes were concentrated on Amicon UM 2 membranes (assigned <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> cutoff 1, 000 daltons) and chromatographed on Sephadex G- 50 columns, some of the biological activity eluted between the <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>markers</b> chymotrypsinogen and cytochrome c (big OAF), {{but there was a}} separate peak of biological activity which eluted with [3 H]proline (140 daltons). This second peak has been called little OAF. Little OAF was eluted from Bio-Gel P 6 columns between the <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> <b>markers</b> calcitonin (approximately 3, 500 daltons) and vitamin B 12 (1, 330 daltons), but was retained by Spectrapor dialysis tubing (nominal <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> cutoff 3, 500 daltons). Big OAF was converted to little OAF by equilibration in 1 M NaCl or 2 M urea. Little OAF was self-associated back to big OAF by equilibration in buffers of low ionic strength (Tris-HCl 10 - 50 mM). Little OAF was extracted into the organic phase in ethyl acetate after acidification of the sample to pH 3. 5. The biological activity remained in the aqueous phase after ethyl acetate extraction at pH 7. 5 - 8. 4. Little OAF has been purified more than 6, 000 -fold compared with the original material so that bone-resorbing activity is maximal in a sample with a protein concentration of 80 ng/ml...|$|R
