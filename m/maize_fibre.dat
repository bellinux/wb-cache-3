40|$|The {{enrichment}} of gluten-free (GF) {{baked products}} with dietary fibre (DF) {{seems to be}} necessary since {{it has been reported}} that coeliac patients have generally a low intake of DF due to their GF diet. Response surface methodology was used to optimize a fibre-enriched GF bread formulation based on corn starch, rice flour and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. <b>Maize</b> <b>fibre</b> and water were the predictor variables (factors), and loaf specific volume, crumb firmness and crumb L value were the dependent variables (responses) used to assess the product quality. The optimal formulation, determined from the data, contained 6. 5 % <b>maize</b> <b>fibre</b> and 102. 5 % water, starch/flour base. The developed mathematical models for the measured responses could be successfully used for their prediction during baking. Shelf-life study of the optimized formulation revealed that bread stored under modified atmosphere packaging exhibited lower crumb firmness and moisture content values, and thus remained softer through storage. Scanning electron microscopy of the crumb showed a continuum matrix between starch and <b>maize</b> <b>fibre,</b> in the optimized formulation, obtaining a more aerated structure. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The use {{of energy}} crops and {{agricultural}} residues {{is expected to}} increase to fulfil the legislative demands of bio-based components in transport fuels. Ensiling methods, adapted from the feed sector, are suitable storage methods to preserve fresh crops throughout the year for, for example, biogas production. Various preservation methods, namely ensiling with and without acid addition for whole crop <b>maize,</b> <b>fibre</b> hemp and faba bean were investigated. For the drier fibre hemp, alkaline urea treatment was studied as well. These treatments were also explored as mild pretreatment methods to improve the disassembly and hydrolysis of these lignocellulosic substrates. Results The investigated storage treatments increased the availability of the substrates for biogas production from hemp and in most cases from whole maize but not from faba bean. Ensiling of hemp, without or with addition of formic acid, increased methane production by more than 50 % compared to fresh hemp. Ensiling resulted in substantially increased methane yields also from maize, and the use of formic acid in ensiling of maize further enhanced methane yields by 16 %, as compared with fresh maize. Ensiled faba bean, in contrast, yielded somewhat less methane than the fresh material. Acidic additives preserved and even increased the amount of the valuable water-soluble carbohydrates during storage, which affected most significantly the enzymatic hydrolysis yield of maize. However, preservation without additives decreased the enzymatic hydrolysis yield especially in maize, due to its high content of soluble sugars that were already converted to acids during storage. Urea-based preservation significantly increased the enzymatic hydrolysability of hemp. Hemp, preserved with urea, produced the highest carbohydrate increase of 46 % in enzymatic hydrolysis as compared to the fresh material. Alkaline pretreatment conditions of hemp improved also the methane yields. Conclusions The results of the present work show that ensiling and alkaline preservation of fresh crop materials are useful pretreatment methods for methane production. Improvements in enzymatic hydrolysis were also promising. While all three crops still require a more powerful pretreatment to release the maximum amount of carbohydrates, anaerobic preservation is clearly a suitable storage and pretreatment method prior to production of platform sugars from fresh crops. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Maize</b> stalk <b>fibres</b> {{can be used}} as fillers {{in natural}} rubber {{composites}} replacing expensive and non-biodegradable inorganic fillers. <b>Maize</b> stalk <b>fibres</b> were chemically modified with acetic anhydride (acetylation) to enhance their compatibility with the hydrophobic rubber polymer matrix. The fibre was characterised using FTIR showing a spectrum with a well defined peak at 1742 cm- 1 (attributed to the carbonyl groups –C=O), indicating that new acetyl groups were introduced to cellulose. The curing and physico–mechanical properties of the composite as a function of filler loading was determined and compared with the values obtained using commercial grade hydrated silica. The natural rubber-maize stalk filled composites showed good processing safety in terms of torques and scorch. Compared with untreated maize-natural rubber composites, the acetylated composites exhibited higher mechanical properties, reduced moisture absorption and higher resistant to hydrothermal aging. Based on mechanical properties and statistical treatment of data, composites filled with 20 phr treated maize stalk had the optimum set of mechanical properties (tensile strength of 22. 4 MPa, elongation at break 404 % and hardness Shore A of 55) that were closely comparable with commercial hydrated silica filled composites. Maize stalk has therefore demonstrated its potential to be used to reinforce natural rubber for shoe sole production...|$|R

The percent dry weight of the peels showed that the yield of sun dried peels which can be obtained per unit weight of fresh peels decreased in the order SO i > SO w > Le > Li. Highly significant variations (p< 0. 01) existed between the proximate constituents among the peel meal, and their dry matter of about 89 % and crude protein of 9. 30 - 10. 96 % are {{comparable to that of}} <b>maize.</b> Crude <b>fibre</b> and ash which were approximately 14 % and 5 % respectively are higher than 2. 1 % CF and 1. 22 % ash in <b>maize.</b> Acid detergent <b>fibre</b> was significantly different (p< 0. 05), while hemi-cellulose, cellulose, ADF and NDF were highly significantly different (p< 0. 01) among the peels. The ADF seems high in all the peels and growth trials are recommended with monogastric and ruminant animals to evaluate the replacement value of these citrus peel meals when incorporated into the diets of these farm animals...|$|R
40|$|The {{enrichment}} of gluten-free {{baked products}} with dietary fibre {{seems to be}} necessary since {{it has been reported}} that coeliac patients have generally a low intake of fibre due to their gluten-free diet. In the present study different cereal <b>fibres</b> (wheat, <b>maize,</b> oat and barley) were added at 3, 6 and 9 g/ 100 g level into a gluten-free bread formulation based on corn starch, rice flour and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC). Doughs were evaluated based on consistency, viscosity and thermal properties. Results showed that <b>maize</b> and oat <b>fibre</b> can be added to gluten-free bread with positive impact on bread nutritional and sensory properties. All breads with 9 g/ 100 g fibre increased the fibre content of control by 218 %, but they were rated lower than those with 3 and 6 g/ 100 g fibre due to their powdery taste. The formulation containing barley fibre produced loaves that had more intense color and volume comparable to the control. During storage of breads a reduction in crumb moisture content and an increase in firmness were observed. The micrographs of the crumb showed the continuous matrix between starch and <b>maize</b> and/or oat <b>fibre</b> obtaining a more aerated structure. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} {{with the level of}} acceptability and perceptions of three types of commercially produced roller-milled white maize meal namely: sifted unfortified, sifted fortified and super fortified versus hammer-mill produced white and yellow maize meal (with and without fibre) among Shangaan consumers in Giyani in the Limpopo Province, South Africa (SA). The local households produce maize grain on a small scale or buy it from small scale farmers and take it to the local small scale millers for milling for a fee. The 48 participants for this project were female consumers (eighteen years old or older). The study was divided into two phases. The aim of the first phase was to determine the difference if any in acceptability of the sensory attributes of the various maize meal types. It employed a sensory evaluation technique which is a quantitative scientific method in which numerical data was collected and analysed in order to determine and compare consumer acceptability. The aim of the second phase was to discuss the perceptions of these consumers in relation to the products and employed focus-group interviews. During phase one maize meal porridge was prepared by local community volunteers under careful supervision in a standardized manner. The porridge was served warm: two samples at a time, marked with 3 -digit random codes. None of the participants had any prior information pertaining to the samples they were tasting at any time. The identity of the samples were only revealed during the focus-group interviews (phase two). Consumers preferred (liked) white sifted fortified maize meal porridge on a double blind basis more than the white sifted unfortified maize meal porridge. Hammer-mill white and hammer-mill yellow <b>maize</b> porridge with <b>fibre</b> were equally disliked by participants. There {{was no significant difference in}} the acceptability of hammer-mill white compared to yellow <b>maize</b> meal without <b>fibre.</b> No significant difference was found in preference for aroma, colour, consistency and taste between white sifted unfortified and super fortified maize meal compared to white hammer-mill <b>maize</b> meal without <b>fibre.</b> The difference in taste preference can only be attributed to the fortificant that is added commercially to the maize meal. This is quite a significant finding and different to that measured prior to the implementation of the SA National Fortification Scheme, where no impact on taste was measured. Furthermore, consumers’ preference for fortified maize meal on a double blind bias is in contrast to previous findings of research indicating a degree of dislike among consumers regarding fortified maize meal, according to maize millers’ opinion. During phase two focus-group interviews were conducted immediately following phase one. The participants sat in a cluster for these interviews. The qualitative data was transcribed verbatim into text for analysis and discussion of results. At least 40 out of 48 consumers stated that they liked the hammer-mill yellow maize meal porridge in terms of aroma, colour, texture, taste and for its nutritional value. Those in Homu 14 village stated that if the price of roller-mill maize meal was similar to that of yellow maize meal they would buy both maize types as they liked them equally but those in Mahlathi would buy yellow maize meal for nutritional reasons.

40|$|A {{moderate}} halophile and thermotolerant fungal strain {{was isolated}} from a sugarcane bagasse fermentation {{in the presence}} of 2 M NaCl that was set in the laboratory. This strain was identified by polyphasic criteria as Aspergillus caesiellus. The fungus showed an optimal growth rate in media containing 1 M NaCl at 28 °C and could grow in media added with up to 2 M NaCl. This strain was able to grow at 37 and 42 °C, with or without NaCl. A. caesiellus H 1 produced cellulases, xylanases, manganese peroxidase (MnP) and esterases. No laccase activity was detected in the conditions we tested. The cellulase activity was thermostable, halostable, and no differential expression of cellulases was observed in media with different salt concentrations. However, differential band patterns for cellulase and xylanase activities were detected in zymograms when the fungus was grown in different lignocellulosic substrates such as wheat straw, <b>maize</b> stover, agave <b>fibres,</b> sugarcane bagasse and sawdust. Optimal temperature and pH were similar to other cellulases previously described. These results support the potential of this fungus to degrade lignocellulosic materials and its possible use in biotechnological applications...|$|R
40|$|Four {{fibre crops}} (hemp, kenaf, maize and sorghum) {{considered}} amongst {{the most suitable}} for the conditions of Northern Italy were compared in 1995 and 1997, over two irrigation regimes (rainfed conditions and restoration of 100 ␎Tp) and in two locations (Bologna and Milano). Three harvests were carried out on each crop at different development stages. At each harvest time data on yield and yield components were collected. Sub-samples of stems of each crop and at each harvest time were analysed following the Van Soest method. On average, fibre sorghum {{proved to be the}} higher yielding crop. It produced 26. 2 Mg ha− 1 of total dry matter of which 18. 1 Mg ha− 1 was partitioned to the stems. <b>Fibre</b> <b>maize</b> produced more total dry matter than kenaf (19. 0 Mg– 15. 7 Mg ha− 1) but dry matter accumulated to stems was higher in kenaf (10. 8 and 13. 4 Mg ha− 1). On average, fibre hemp yielded 14. 0 Mg ha− 1 of total dry matter and 10. 9 Mg ha− 1 of stems. This result was highly affected by the low hemp production in Bologna in 1995, where unfavourable conditions, in the first phases of cultivation, resulted in a stunted establishment of the crop (18. 7 Mg ha− 1 of total dry matter in Milano and only 8. 3 Mg ha− 1 of total dry matter in Bologna). On all crops, irrigation produced a slight increase in total biomass (7 €and in stem dry matter (9 €compared to the rainfed condition. In both locations, yield increase due to irrigation was larger in maize and kenaf, than in hemp while, in 1995, it caused a severe lodging on sorghum. The four species proved to be different for growth rates, patterns of development and particularly for cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin content of stems. Cellulose content varied between 56 – 66 ␘f stem dry matter in hemp, 46 – 57 ␒n kenaf, 35 – 45 ␒n maize and 39 – 47 ␒n sorghum. As harvest time was delayed, cellulose content tended to increase for hemp and kenaf while it decrease for sorghum and maize. Hemicellulose content of hemp and kenaf stems varied between 16 – 19 °while it varied between 26 – 29 ␒n sorghum and maize. Hemicellulose content decreased with irrigation and with delay in harvest time. Lignin content in hemp stem ranged between 8 and 13 °it was 6. 9 ␒n kenaf and maize, and ca 8 ␒n sorghum...|$|R
