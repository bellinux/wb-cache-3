5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E
25|$|Salmon was the {{preferred}} food of the Stó:lō and {{was seen as}} superior to other types of meat. Meat and salmon were classified differently and salmon was said to give individuals energy while meat <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> heavy and lazy. In order to have salmon through the off seasons it was preserved through two different methods. In the summer salmon was wind dried with salt in the Fraser Canyon. In the fall salmon was smoked, this was traditionally done {{for a week or}} two but with modern refrigeration technology smoking is only done for a few days. Dried salmon was then either boiled or steamed before eating.|$|E

500|$|In 2003, Keenan {{surfaced}} {{under the}} name [...] "Puscifer" [...] for the song [...] "REV 22:20" [...] on the Underworld film soundtrack. Puscifer was once advertised as a side project with Danny Lohner, who had formerly performed live with Nine Inch Nails, but has since been formed {{as a manifestation of}} Keenan's [...] "creative subconscious"—meaning that Keenan is now using the name as a pseudonym for his solo work. Keenan has stated that it is [...] "a premiere improvisational hardcore band", and his [...] "catch-all, stream of consciousness, anything goes, etc." [...] project. When comparing the project to Tool in an interview with Rolling Stone, Keenan described it as his [...] "attempt to make music to inspire people. ... This is definitely not thinking man's music, but groove-oriented music that <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> good." [...] In a later interview with Artistdirect, Keenan said {{that he did not want}} the lyrics to be puzzles. He wanted the complexity to be in the music, stating [...] "that's the part that gets under your skin and <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> good." ...|$|E

[...] Taubin praised Ackroyd's [...] "brilliant" [...] cinematography with multiple viewpoints. She said of the film's editing, [...] "Bob Murawski and Chris Innis's editing is similarly quick and nervous; the rapid changes in POV as they cut from one camera's coverage to another's <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> as if you, like the characters, are under threat from all sides." ...|$|E

500|$|Astaire {{recalled}} how this success helped restore Berlin's flagging self-confidence. Astaire {{had never met}} Berlin before this film, although he had danced [...] on stage {{to some of his}} tunes as early as 1915. There ensued a lifelong friendship with Berlin contributing to more Astaire films (six in total) than any other composer. Of his experience with Astaire in Top Hat Berlin wrote: [...] "He's a real inspiration for a writer. I'd never have written Top Hat without him. He <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> so secure." ...|$|E

[...] "Nothing is square and, although you can't {{put your finger}} on it, it just <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like something is not right". [...] Skewing was also part of the overall design for the color palette used in set decoration and costume design. [...] "In the real world, the colors are bright and rich," [...] Willet said. [...] "In the skewed world, they're washed out and faded. [...] Nothing is obvious, and it's only in the overall effect that these subtle differences will work their magic".|$|E
500|$|Nine of {{the songs}} in the album were {{composed}} before or during Grohl's tenure with Nirvana, and existed in demos created by Grohl on his home 8-track tape recorder. The only compositions done after Cobain's death were [...] "This Is a Call", [...] "I'll Stick Around", [...] "X-Static" [...] and [...] "Wattershed". The music mostly followed a hard rock sound with the soft-loud dynamics seen in Nirvana tracks such as [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] and [...] "Heart-Shaped Box". Variants include the melancholic [...] "Exhausted", which Grohl defined as a song that's [...] "sad but <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> good".|$|E

500|$|Jazz, blues, and gospel musicians {{continued}} to use Hammond organs into the 21st century. Barbara Dennerlein has received critical acclaim for her performances on the Hammond, particularly her use of the bass pedals, and has modified the instrument to include samplers triggered by the pedals. Joey DeFrancesco embraced the instrument during the 1990s, and later collaborated with Jimmy Smith. He is positive {{about the future of}} the Hammond organ, saying [...] "Everybody loves it. It <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> good... I think it's bigger now than ever." [...] Grammy-winning jazz keyboardist Cory Henry learned to play the Hammond organ at age two and used it on 2016's The Revival.|$|E

Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> good. That's how I felt about 'Billie Jean'. I {{knew it was going to}} be big when I was writing it." [...] The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: [...] "The kid probably saved our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone {{noted that}} [...] "Celebration kicks off with pure bliss and never lets up.

Her hitmaking genius is {{unmatched}} and [...] undiminished." [...] However, Sheffield called the omission of [...] "Angel" [...] "just plain crazypants." [...] Lean Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly commented that the album [...] "holds up surprisingly well". Joey Guerra from Houston Chronicle praised the album saying [...] "every song on Celebration defines a moment in time, a radio sing-along, a twirl under the glitterball. It's a pulsing testament to Madonna's often-overlooked pop prowess, from the scrappy electro beginnings of 'Everybody' and 'Burning Up' to the retro-disco swirl of 'Beautiful Stranger' and 'Hung Up', still a hands-in-the-air highlight." ...|$|E
500|$|Talpade, who {{previously}} featured {{as the title}} character of Kukunoor's Iqbal (2005), observed the bahuroopiyas in Rajasthan and incorporated their dialect, accent, and their body language for his character.

[...] Through his character of a bahuroopiya, Talpade was required to perform mimicry. While he was good at mimicry in college, it was during the filming of Iqbal, Kukunoor noted this talent of his and thus Dor came into Talpade's hands.

500|$|The Castle Doctrine {{was created}} by indie {{developer}} Jason Rohrer; its ideas were drawn from Rohrer's childhood anxieties about his family's house being burgled, and his adult sense of responsibility over protecting his family. [...] The game's central theme is the castle doctrine and includes the issue of gun rights; Rohrer created it partially as an [...] "artistic statement" [...] on defending one's family through violence. He summarized his goals with the game as creating something [...] "that <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> violated and {{makes you want to}} protect stuff that’s yours, and puts you in the process of securing what’s yours." [...] However, he has remarked that the consequence of making players feel hypocritical—since they are invading others' homes as well—was partially intentional and an [...] "elegant" [...] idea.|$|E
500|$|Critics universally acknowledged, {{but gave}} mixed {{opinions}} on, the game's {{high level of}} difficulty. This sentiment was epitomized by Sliva's comment that [...] "Don't Starve will never, ever hold your hand, and I both love it and hate it for that." [...] For example, he felt some of his deaths were unfairly caused by the game's camera system obscuring needed objects. Meunier stated that [...] "survival doesn't come easy, but there's an undeniable thrill to the challenge," [...] but also placed the high difficulty in his list of the game's cons. Leon Hurley of Official PlayStation Magazine claimed that [...] "learning is half the fun and even the smallest victory <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like you’re winning with a capital FU." [...] Reviewers also felt that players' levels of satisfaction would depend heavily on their levels of commitment to survival.|$|E
