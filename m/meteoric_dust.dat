"Sire: It is my high {{privilege}} to apprise you of my arrival {{on the western}} slope of a mighty depression running {{through the center of}} the continent north and south, formerly known as the Mississippi Valley. It was once the seat of a thriving and prosperous population known as the Pukes, but is now a vast expanse of bare rock, from which every particle of soil and everything movable, including people, animals and vegetation, have been lifted by terrific cyclones and scattered afar, falling in other lands and at sea in the form of what was called <b>meteoric</b> <b>dust!</b> I find that these terrible phenomena began to occur about the year 1860, and lasted, with increasing frequency and power, through a century, culminating about the middle of that glacial period which saw the extinction of the Galoots and their neighboring tribes. There was, of course, a close connection between the two malefic phenomena, both, doubtless, being due to the same cause, which I have been unable to trace. A cyclone, I venture to remind your gracious Majesty, is a mighty whirlwind, accompanied by the most startling meteorological phenomena, such as electrical disturbances, floods of falling water, darkness and so forth. It moves with great speed, sucking up everything and reducing it to powder. In many days' journey I have not found a square copret of the country that did not suffer a visitation. If any human being escaped he must speedily have perished from starvation. For some twenty centuries the Pukes have been an extinct race, and their country a desolation in which no living thing can dwell, unless, like me, it is supplied with Dr. Blobob's Condensed Life-pills." ...|$|E
50|$|Arc magmas are {{produced}} by the dehydration of minerals contained in oceanic crust formed at mid-ocean ridges. Subducted oceanic crust consists of a four major units. The topmost unit is a thin cap of pelagic sediments up to 0.3 km thick composed of siliceous and calcareous shells, <b>meteoric</b> <b>dusts,</b> and variable amounts of volcanic ash. The next unit is composed of 0.3-0.7 km thick pillow basalts, formed by the quenching of basaltic magma as it erupts into ocean water. Under the pillow basalts is a basaltic sheeted dike complex, that represent cooled magma conduits. The bottom units represent the crystallized magma chamber, feeding the mid-ocean ridge at which the crust was formed. It is composed of 1-5 km thick layered gabbro atop <7 km thick layer of ultramafic rocks (e.g. wehrlite, harzburgite, dunite, and chromite). Oceanic crust {{is referred to as}} a metabasite.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{weathering}} and soil formation processes operating on detrital sediments containing alkaline volcanic rock {{fragments of the}} Mirador del Río dolocrete profile. The profile consists of a lower horizon of removilised weathered basalts, an intermediate red sandy mudstones horizon with irregular carbonate layers and a topmost horizon of amalgamated carbonate layers with root traces. Formation occurred in arid to semiarid climates, giving place to a complex mineralogical association, including Mg-carbonates and chabazite, rarely described in cal/dolocretes profiles. Initial vadose weathering processes occurred in the basalts and in directly overlying detrital sediments, producing (Stage 1) red-smectites and dolomicrite. Dominant phreatic (Stage 2) conditions allowed precipitation of coarse-zoned dolomite and chabazite filling porosities. In Stages 3 and 4, mostly pedogenic, biogenic processes {{played an important role}} in dolomite and calcite accumulation in the profile. Overall evolution of the profile and its mineralogical association involved initial processes dominated by alteration of host rock, to provide silica and Mg-rich alkaline waters, suitable for chabazite and dolomite formation, without a previous carbonate phase. Dolomite formed both abiogenically and biogenically, but without a previous carbonate precursor and in the absence of evaporites. Dominance of calcite towards the profile top is the result of Mg/Ca decrease in the interstitial meteoric waters due to decreased supply of Mg from weathering, and increased supply of Ca in aeolian <b>dust.</b> <b>Meteoric</b> origin of the water is confirmed by C and O isotope values, which also indicate lack of deep sourced CO 2. The dolocrete studied and its complex mineral association reveal the complex interactions that occur at surface during weathering and pedogenesis of basalt-sourced rocks.

30|$|Electron density {{profiles}} {{from the}} ionosphere of Mars that {{were obtained by}} the Mariner 9 radio occultation experiment in 1971 – 1972 have unique scientific value because they extend to higher altitudes than comparable datasets and were acquired during a tremendous dust storm that had substantial and poorly understood effects on the ionosphere. Yet these profiles are not publicly available in an accessible format. Here, we describe the recovery of these profiles, which are made available {{as part of this}} article. The validity of the profiles was tested by using them to explore the effects of a dust storm on the topside ionosphere, the morphology of the topside ionosphere, the behavior of the M 1 layer, and possible <b>meteoric</b> layers. The <b>dust</b> storm that waned {{over the course of the}} primary mission (November–December 1971) had major effects on the ionosphere of Mars. It elevated the M 1 and M 2 layers of the ionosphere by 20 – 30 km, but the separation of the two layers stayed fixed throughout the primary mission, which suggests that the neutral atmosphere at these altitudes was not heated during the dust storm. However, the altitude of the 1500 cm − 3 density level, a proxy for the top of the ionosphere, decreased steadily by 74 ± 12 km over the course of the primary mission. Mariner 9 observations of the topside ionosphere differ from comparable Mars Express observations. Compared to Mars Express, the Mariner 9 data, which were acquired during a period of relatively high solar wind dynamic pressure, have lower densities at high altitudes. They are also more likely to have a “one scale height” morphology than a “two scale height” morphology. The peak density of the M 1 layer depends on solar zenith angle and solar irradiance similarly to previous studies with Mars Global Surveyor observations, which indicates that dust storms do not affect the behavior of the peak density. No clear meteoric layers were identified.|$|R

40|$|In-situ {{composition}} {{measurements of}} the mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT) are challenging; this region is only accessible via high-speed sounding rockets, ambient pressures extend into the 10 - 3 Torr range, and particles of interest range in mass from electrons to <b>meteoric</b> smoke and <b>dust</b> particles. Time-of-flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MS) are capable of making fast, accurate measurements over a wide mass range. However, since they rely on pressure-sensitive microchannel plate (MCP) detectors and high voltages, they have rarely been applied at these altitudes. A new TOF-MS for making in-situ composition measurements in the MLT has been developed at the Space Dynamics Laboratory. This instrument employs modest acceleration potentials and a pressure-tolerant MCP detector. A Bradbury-Nielsen gate is used to produce short, well-defined ion pulses to reduce the temporal and spatial uncertainty of sampled ions. A prototype TOF-MS was constructed and used to demonstrate TOF-MS technology under conditions relevant to in-situ MLT measurements. Operational boundaries and capabilities of this new instrument were identified through laboratory experiments combined with computer modeling. The prototype instrument achieved a maximum resolution of 100 at m/z 40 (Ar), sufficient to resolve major atmospheric species of interest. During experiments at elevated pressures, the MCP detector maintained low background count rates (/second) at pressures as high as 10 - 3 Torr. A novel getter-based vacuum system was evaluated for use with the new TOF-MS, and a computer model was developed to simulate instrument pressure during a rocket flight. Results from these experiments suggest that when combined with an appropriately sized sampling aperture, this pumping system can extend the measurement range of the instrument to lower altitudes by 10 – 20 km, compared to an unpumped instrument. A computer model was developed to {{study the effects of}} critical operating parameters on instrument performance; the most important factor affecting resolution was found to be the initial energy spread of sampled ions.

50|$|Small, sand-grain sized meteoroids are {{entering}} the atmosphere constantly, essentially every few seconds in any given region of the atmosphere, and thus ionization trails {{can be found in}} the upper atmosphere more or less continuously.

Meteor radars can measure atmospheric density and winds by measuring the decay rate and Doppler shift of a meteor trail. Most meteoroids burn up when they enter the atmosphere. The left-over debris is called <b>meteoric</b> <b>dust</b> or just meteor dust. Meteor dust particles can persist in the atmosphere for up to several months. These particles might affect climate, both by scattering electromagnetic radiation and by catalyzing chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere.

40|$|The {{ionosphere}} {{is always}} assumed to contain {{equal numbers of}} positive and negative charges in a given volume (quasineutrality). Hence fewer electrons than positive charges are an indication of negative charges other than electrons. Theories predict and in-situ mass spectrometer measurements confirmed that these negative charges are negative ions, but recent experimental results suggest that other scavengers of free electrons can also be active in the mesosphere. Outside the polar summer mesosphere this additional removal of electrons is today believed to be due to <b>meteoric</b> <b>dust,</b> which maximises in the mesosphere. Data predominantly from the recent ECOMA flights are used to test this presumption. Six sounding rockets carried different dust detectors, as well as probes for electrons and ions.

30|$|We {{found that}} the {{spectral}} width of PMWE in the vertical beam was larger than that in their absence, i.e. than for IS spectra (8 – 10 vs. 5 – 6  m/s), with any beam broadening expected to contribute equally to both. This {{is in line with}} the result reported by Belova et al. (2013) for winter echoes during a solar proton event in November 2004 although spectral width values were different there. This may be interpreted as enhanced neutral turbulence or/and presence of patches of small negatively charged <b>meteoric</b> <b>dust.</b> The former results in increased turbulent velocities of neutrals and, hence, in highly collisional plasma, ions and electrons, that we see as enhanced spectral width. According to the model calculations depicted in Figs.  10 and 11 of Belova et al. (2013), in order to have spectral widths as measured on 8 January 2014 the turbulence dissipation rate should be in the range between 150 and 500  mW/kg. This is very high compared to the typical values of 1 – 10  mW/kg derived from the numerous rocket experiments for 60 – 75  km in wintertime (Lübken 1997). The presence of negatively charged particles with radius less than 1  nm leads to increasing electron diffusivity (as negative ions do in the lower D region) that widen the IS spectra (Cho et al. 1998) and could explain our observations. However, the mechanism that confines <b>meteoric</b> <b>dust</b> in narrow layers or patches is still unknown.|$|E

DUSTER (Dust in the Upper Stratosphere Tracking Experiment and Retrieval) was designed to intercept the nanometer to micrometer <b>meteoric</b> <b>dust</b> from these events for laboratory analyses while it {{is still in the}} upper stratosphere. This effort required extraordinary precautions to avoid particle contamination during collection and in the laboratory. Here we report dust from the upper stratosphere that was collected during two campaigns one in 2008 and another in 2011. We collected and characterized forty five uncontaminated <b>meteoric</b> <b>dust</b> particles. The collected particles are alumina, aluminosilica, plagioclase, fassaite, silica, CaCO 3, CaO, extreme F-rich COCa particles, and oxocarbon particles. These particles are found in friable CI and CM carbonaceous chondrite, and unequilibrated ordinary chondrite meteoroids that are the most common source of bolides and fireballs. The oxocarbons have no meteorite counterparts. Some F-bearing CaCO 3 particles changed shape when they interacted with the ambient laboratory atmosphere which might indicate their highly unequilibrated state as a result of fragmentation. Equilibrium considerations constrain the thermal regime experienced by the collected particles between ∼ 2000 °C and ∼ 1000 °C, as high as 3700 °C and as low as ∼ 650 °C after 9 s, followed by rapid quenching (μs) to below 1600 °C, but equilibrium conditions during these events is most unlikely.

Nucleation of photochemically produced sulfuric acid onto polysulfur condensation nuclei generates mode 1 cloud droplets that then diffuse upwards into the UH. Droplets generated in the UH from nucleation of sulfuric acid onto <b>meteoric</b> <b>dust</b> coagulate with the upwelled cloud particles and cannot reproduce the observed bimodal size distribution. The mass transport enabled by cloud top transient winds are able to generate a bimodal size distribution in a time scale consistent with observations. Sedimentation and convection in the middle and lower clouds causes the formation of large mode 2 and mode 3 particles. Evaporation of these particles below the clouds creates a local sulfuric acid vapor maximum that causes upwelling of sulfuric acid back into the clouds. If the polysulfur condensation nuclei are small and their production rate is high, coagulation of small droplets onto larger droplets in the middle cloud may result in sulfuric acid "rain" below the clouds once every few Earth months. Reduction of the polysulfur condensation nuclei production rate destroys this oscillation and reduces the mode 1 particle abundance in the middle cloud by two orders of magnitude, though it better reproduces the sulfur-to-sulfuric-acid mass ratio in the cloud and haze droplets.

A nucleation of this ice layer on sulfuric acid aerosols is hypothesized. Temperatures of the Venus mesopause, near 120 km altitude, are frequently cold enough to allow ice nucleation on <b>meteoric</b> <b>dust</b> or ambient ions, yielding a haze (analogous to noctilucent clouds on earth) which is expected to be tenuous to the point of optical invisibility...|$|E

Adiabatic cooling of the upwelling air mass produces a temperature minimum of − 140  °C at the polar summer mesopause (about 85  km), making it the coldest region of the Earth’s environment (McIntyre 1989).

Below the altitude where the cloud particles are generated, sedimentation and vigorous convection causes the formation of large mode 2 and mode 3 particles in the middle and lower clouds. Evaporation of the particles below the clouds causes a local sulfuric acid vapor maximum that results in upwelling of sulfuric acid back into the clouds. In the case where the polysulfur condensation nuclei are small and their production rate is high, coagulation of small droplets onto larger droplets in the middle cloud may set up an oscillation in the size modes of the particles such that precipitation of sulfuric acid “rain” may be possible immediately below the clouds once every few Earth months. Reduction of the polysulfur condensation nuclei production rate destroys this oscillation and reduces the mode 1 particle abundance in the middle cloud by two orders of magnitude.

It is very important to make good measurements of the flux of meteoric material entering the upper atmosphere, because <b>meteoric</b> <b>dust</b> plays an important role in the chemistry and heat balance of the middle atmosphere and thus forms a very important input into middle atmosphere models. In addition, the observations can contribute to work on solar system dust models (e.g. Mann 1995). Last, if wideband receiving capability is retained, the work utilising interplanetary scintillation can be continued to give information of the structures in the solar wind.|$|E
40|$|Aerosols- Aerosols {{are fine}} solid or liquid {{particles}} {{suspended in the}} atmosphere, where they reside typically for days to weeks before settling to the ground or being washed out by rain or snow. They arise both from natural sources (such as desert dust, sea spray and volcanic eruptions) and from human activities involving {{burning of fossil fuels}} and vegetation. Visible forms of atmospheric aerosol plumes include dust, smoke, smog and haze. Aerosol particles are small, but numerous, and often comprise of a number of inorganic and organic substances. They adversely affect human health, and thus are regulated as air pollutants. As an integral component of the Earth’s climate system, aerosols interact strongly with sunlight, and provide condensation nuclei for cloud formation. Man-made aerosols alter the climate in fundamental ways. History of Study Modern aerosol science finds its root in the so-called Age of Enlightenment, during which many hypotheses on the origin of aerosols were postulated. Scattered observations made in the 19 th century helped rule out some of them (such as earthquakes, thunderstorm lightning and <b>meteoric</b> <b>dust).</b> In 1783, Benjamin Franklin, then the United States ambassador to France, speculated that a volcanic eruption in Icelan...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{consists}} of basic {{description of the}} twilight sounding method of the atmosphere investigations {{and the results of}} polarization measurements of the twilight sky. These observations allow to detect the aerosol in the stratosphere after the Rabaul volcano eruption in 2006 and the <b>meteoric</b> <b>dust</b> in the mesosphere after the strong maximum of Leonids shower in 2002. Optical measurements of the sky background during the twilight period are an effective tool for the detection and investigations of aerosol in the different layers of the atmosphere. Ascension of Earth’s shadow above the observer with the depression of Sun leads to the increase of the effective altitude of the solar emission scattering in the atmosphere [1]. Having conducted the sky background measurements during the whole twilight period, we made the vertical scan of the atmosphere and build the profile of trace gases and atmospheric aerosol from the troposphere to mesosphere. The basic problem of the twilight method of atmosphere investigations is the large contribution of multiple scattering [2]. This value was difficult to estimate through the whole XX century. The exact mathematical models had appeared just recently [3]. The possibilities of twilight method sufficiently expand if the sky background polarization is also mea-sured. First, it helps to separate the multiple scattering due to the difference of polarization properties o...|$|E
