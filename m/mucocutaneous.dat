25|$|<b>Mucocutaneous</b> {{leishmaniasis}} causes both {{skin and}} mucosal ulcers with damage primarily {{of the nose}} and mouth.|$|E
25|$|Pemphigus is an {{uncommon}} autoimmune skin disease. The {{most common form}} in dogs is pemphigus foliaceus, which manifests as erosions and crusting of the skin and <b>mucocutaneous</b> junctions. Pemphigus vulgaris is more rare and manifests as blister-like lesions in the mouth and at <b>mucocutaneous</b> junctions. Bullous pemphigoid is most commonly seen in Dobermanns and Collies and appears as a scald-like lesion of the groin.|$|E
25|$|Leishmania braziliensis :Treatment with {{pentavalent}} antimonials or amphotericin is necessary, {{because of}} the risk of developing disfiguring <b>mucocutaneous</b> lesions.|$|E
25|$|In {{autoimmune}} polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) also autoimmunity and infections coexist: organ-specific autoimmune manifestations (e.g. hypoparathyroidism and adrenocortical failure) {{and chronic}} <b>mucocutaneous</b> candidiasis.|$|E
25|$|Leishmaniasis is {{a disease}} caused by parasites of the Leishmania type. It is spread by the bite of certain types of sandflies. The disease can present in three main ways: {{cutaneous}}, <b>mucocutaneous,</b> or visceral leishmaniasis. The cutaneous form presents with skin ulcers, while the <b>mucocutaneous</b> form presents with ulcers of the skin, mouth, and nose, and the visceral form starts with skin ulcers and then later presents with fever, low red blood cells, and enlarged spleen and liver.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide {{has also}} been used due to its immune-modifying effect. Dapsone and {{rebamipide}} have been shown, in small studies, to have beneficial results for <b>mucocutaneous</b> lesions.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of cases during World Wars I and II focused {{attention}} on the triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis (often with additional <b>mucocutaneous</b> lesions), which {{at that time was}} also referred to as Fiessenger-Leroy-Reiter syndrome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mucocutaneous</b> {{leishmaniasis}} is {{an especially}} disturbing form of cutaneous leishmaniasis, because it produces destructive and disfiguring lesions of the face. It is most often caused by Leishmania braziliensis, but cases caused by L. aethiopica have also been described.|$|E
25|$|Different {{types of}} the disease occur in {{different}} regions of the world. Cutaneous disease is most common in Afghanistan, Algeria, Brazil, Colombia, and Iran, while <b>mucocutaneous</b> disease is most common in Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru, and visceral disease is most common in Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, and Sudan.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mucocutaneous</b> lesions can be present. Common {{findings}} include oral ulcers {{that come}} and go. In some cases, these ulcers are painless and go unnoticed. In the oral cavity, the patients may suffer from recurrent aphthous stomatitis, geographic tongue and migratory stomatitis in higher prevalence {{than the general}} population.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} side effects are mucocutaneous: dry lips, skin and nose. Other common <b>mucocutaneous</b> side effects are {{inflammation}} and chapping of the lips (cheilitis), redness {{of the skin}} (erythema), rashes, peeling, eczema (dermatitis), itching (prunitis) and nose bleeds (epistaxis). Absence of dryness of the lips is considered an indication of non-compliance with treatment (not taking the drug as advised), as it occurs in almost all patients.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{specific}} pathological testing or technique {{available for the}} diagnosis of the disease, although the International Study Group criteria for the disease are highly sensitive and specific, involving clinical criteria and a pathergy test. Behçet's disease has {{a high degree of}} resemblance to diseases that cause <b>mucocutaneous</b> lesions such as Herpes simplex labialis, and therefore clinical suspicion should be maintained until all the common causes of oral lesions are ruled out from the differential diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of acute optic neuropathy include painless loss of vision which may affect either one or both eyes, reduced visual acuity, reduced color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect, central scotoma, swollen optic disc, macular edema, or retrobulbar pain. When these symptoms occur with concurrent <b>mucocutaneous</b> ulcerations, they raise suspicion of acute optic neuropathy in Behçet's Disease. Progressive optic atrophy may result in decreased visual acuity or color vision. Intracranial hypertension with papilledema may be present.|$|E
25|$|Infections {{due to the}} {{immunosuppressant}} drugs used {{in people}} with kidney transplants most commonly occur in <b>mucocutaneous</b> areas (41%), the urinary tract (17%) and the respiratory tract (14%). The most common infective agents are bacterial (46%), viral (41%), fungal (13%), and protozoan (1%). Of the viral illnesses, the most common agents are human cytomegalovirus (31.5%), herpes simplex (23.4%), and herpes zoster (23.4%). BK virus is now being increasingly recognised. Infection {{is the cause of}} death in about one third of people with renal transplants, and pneumonias account for 50% of the patient deaths from infection.|$|E
25|$|Promastigotes of Leishmania are {{transmitted}} to human skin by {{the bite of}} a sandfly. Leishmania then invades human macrophages and replicates intracellularly. A raised, red lesion develops {{at the site of}} the bite (often weeks or sometimes years afterwards). The lesion then ulcerates and may become secondarily infected with bacteria. In many species (for example, L. major) the lesion often spontaneously heals with atrophic scarring. In some species (for example, L. braziliensis) the lesion may spontaneously heal with scarring, but then reappear elsewhere (especially as destructive <b>mucocutaneous</b> lesions). Lesions of other Leishmania species may spontaneously heal and then reappear as satellite lesions around the site of the original lesion, or along the route of lymphatic drainage.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{cutaneous}} (skin) {{conditions can}} also involve {{the mouth and}} sometimes only the mouth, sparing the skin. The different environmental conditions (saliva, thinner mucosa, trauma from teeth and food), mean that some cutaneous disorders which produce characteristic lesions on the skin produce only non specific lesions in the mouth. The vesicles and bullae of blistering <b>mucocutaneous</b> disorders progress quickly to ulceration in the mouth, because of moisture and trauma from food and teeth. The high bacterial load in the mouth means that ulcers may become secondarily infected. Cytotoxic drugs administered during chemotherapy target cells with fast turnovers such as malignant cells. However, the epithelia of the mouth also has a high turnover rate and makes oral ulceration (mucositis) a common side effect of chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|New {{treatment}} options are {{arising from the}} new oral drug miltefosine (Impavido) which has shown in several clinical trials to be very efficient and safe in visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Recent studies from Bolivia show a high cure rate for <b>mucocutaneous</b> leishmaniasis. Comparative studies against pentavalent antimonials in Iran and Pakistan are also beginning to show a high cure rate for L. major and L. tropica. It is registered in many countries of Latin America, as well in Germany. In October 2006 it received orphan drug status from the US Food and Drug administration. The drug is generally better tolerated than other drugs. Main side effects are gastrointestinal disturbances in the 1–2 days of treatment which {{does not affect the}} efficacy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mucocutaneous</b> {{leishmaniasis}} is {{very difficult}} to treat. Treatment involves the use of pentavalent antimonial compounds, which are highly toxic (common side effects include thrombophlebitis, pancreatitis, cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity) and not very effective. For example, in one study, despite treatment with high doses of sodium stibogluconate for 28 days, only 30% of patients remained disease-free at 12 months follow-up. Even in those patients who achieve an apparent cure, as many as 19% will relapse. Several drug combinations with immunomodulators have been tested, for example, a combination of pentoxifylline (inhibitor of TNF-α) and a pentavalent antimonial at a high dose for 30 days in a small-scale (23 patients) randomised placebo-controlled study from Brazil achieved cure rates of 90% and reduced time to cure, a result that should be interpreted cautiously in light of inherent limitations of small-scale studies. In an earlier small-scale (12 patients) study, addition of imiquimod showed promising results which need yet to be confirmed in larger trials.|$|E
25|$|Visual acuity, {{or color}} vision loss with {{concurrent}} <b>mucocutaneous</b> lesions or systemic Behçet's disease symptoms should raise suspicion of optic nerve involvement in Behçet's disease and prompt a work-up for Behçet's disease if not previously diagnosed {{in addition to}} an ocular work-up. Diagnosis of Behçet's disease is based on clinical findings including oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions such as erythema nodosum, acne, or folliculitis, ocular inflammatory findings and a pathergy reaction. Inflammatory markers such ESR, and CRP may be elevated. A complete ophthalmic examination may include a slit lamp examination, optical coherence tomography to detect nerve loss, visual field examinations, fundoscopic examination to assess optic disc atrophy and retinal disease, fundoscopic angiography, and visual evoked potentials, which may demonstrate increased latency. Optic nerve enhancement may be identified on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in some patients with acute optic neuropathy. However, a normal study does not rule out optic neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may demonstrate elevated protein level with or without pleocytosis. Imaging including angiography may be indicated to identify dural venous sinus thrombosis as a cause of intracranial hypertension and optic atrophy.|$|E

2500|$|Kawasaki disease, {{also known}} as <b>mucocutaneous</b> lymph node syndrome, is a disease in which blood vessels {{throughout}} the body become inflamed. The most common symptoms include a fever that lasts {{for more than five}} days not affected by usual medications, [...] large lymph nodes in the neck, a rash in the genital area, and red eyes, lips, palms or bottoms of the feet. Other symptoms include sore throat and diarrhea. Within three weeks of the onset of symptoms, the skin from the hands and feet may peel. Recovery then typically occurs. In some children, coronary artery aneurysms may form in the heart.|$|E
2500|$|Athlete's foot {{is divided}} into four {{categories}} or presentations: chronic interdigital athlete's foot, plantar (chronic scaly) athlete's foot (aka [...] "moccasin foot"), acute ulcerative tinea pedis, and vesiculobullous athlete's foot. [...] "Interdigital" [...] means between the toes. [...] "Plantar" [...] here refers to the sole of the foot. The ulcerative condition includes macerated lesions with scaly borders. Maceration is the softening and breaking down of skin due to extensive exposure to moisture. [...] A vesiculobullous disease {{is a type of}} <b>mucocutaneous</b> disease characterized by vesicles and bullae (blisters). Both vesicles and bullae are fluid-filled lesions, and they are distinguished by size (vesicles being less than 5–10mm and bulla being larger than 5–10mm, depending upon what definition is used).|$|E
2500|$|The {{arthritis}} {{often is}} coupled with other characteristic symptoms; {{this has been}} called Reiter's syndrome, Reiter's disease or Reiter's arthritis. [...] The term [...] "reactive arthritis" [...] is increasingly used {{as a substitute for}} this designation because of Hans Conrad Julius Reiter's war crimes with the Nazi Party. The manifestations of reactive arthritis include the following triad of symptoms: an inflammatory arthritis of large joints, inflammation of the eyes in the form of conjunctivitis or uveitis, and urethritis in men or cervicitis in women. Arthritis occurring alone following sexual exposure or enteric infection is also known as reactive arthritis. Patients can also present with <b>mucocutaneous</b> lesions, as well as psoriasis-like skin lesions such as circinate balanitis, and keratoderma blennorrhagicum. Enthesitis can involve the Achilles tendon resulting in heel pain. Not all affected persons have all the manifestations.|$|E
2500|$|In 1924, a 5-year-old {{girl who}} lived on the Finnish Åland Islands was brought to Deaconess Hospital in Berlin, Germany, where she was seen by Dr. Erik von Willebrand. He {{ultimately}} assessed 66 members of her family and reported in 1926 that this was a previously undescribed bleeding disorder that differed from hemophilia. [...] Dr von Willebrand recognized the autosomal inheritance pattern, and noted that the bleeding symptoms were greater in children and in women of childbearing age. [...] Thus, he stated that patients with this syndrome had (1) <b>mucocutaneous</b> bleeding, (2) normal clotting time, (3) autosomal inheritance rather than being linked to the X chromosome, and (4) prolonged bleeding times by the Duke method (ear lobe bleeding time). He subsequently found that blood transfusions were useful not only to correct the anemia, but also to control bleeding.|$|E
50|$|A <b>mucocutaneous</b> zone, or <b>mucocutaneous</b> {{boundary}} is {{a region}} {{of the body in}} which mucosa transitions to skin. <b>Mucocutaneous</b> zones occur in animals, at the body orifices.|$|E
50|$|This {{refers to}} a group of rare syndromes {{characterized}} by chronic candidal lesions on the skin, in the mouth and on other mucous membranes (i.e., a secondary oral candidiasis). These include Localized chronic <b>mucocutaneous</b> candidiasis, diffuse <b>mucocutaneous</b> candidiasis (Candida granuloma), candidiasis-endocrinopathy syndrome and candidiasis thymoma syndrome. About 90% of people with chronic <b>mucocutaneous</b> candidiasis have candidiasis in the mouth.|$|E
