50|$|The basic {{fundamental}} of induction generators is {{the conversion}} between mechanical energy to electrical energy. This requires an external torque {{applied to the}} rotor to turn it faster than the synchronous speed. However, indefinitely increasing torque doesn't lead to an indefinite increase in power generation. The rotating magnetic field torque excited from the armature works to counter {{the motion of the}} rotor and prevent over speed because of induced motion in the opposite direction. As the speed of the motor increases the counter <b>torque</b> reaches a <b>max</b> value of <b>torque</b> (breakdown torque) that it can operate until before the operating conditions become unstable. Ideally, induction generators work best in the stable region between the no-load condition and maximum torque region.|$|R
40|$|Research {{has shown}} {{conflicting}} results involving interference of strength development with combined resistance and endurance training. Purpose: To examine if endurance training and resistance training performed concurrently would produce different performance and physiological results {{when compared to}} each type of training alone. Methods: Forty-five untrained males were recruited and {{randomly assigned to one}} of three 12 wk training groups. An endurance training (ET, N= 12) group trained by running (2 - 3 days/week, 20 - 40 min, 65 - 80 % HRR), a resistance training (RT, N= 13) group performed a resistance training program (2 - 3 days/week, 3 sets/ 8 exercises, 6 - 10 reps, 75 - 85 % 1 RM), and a concurrent training (CT, N= 16) group performed both the endurance and resistance training programs (5 days/week, even # week 3 endurance/ 2 resistance workouts, odd # week 3 resistance/ 2 endurance workouts). All groups were tested for all the following variables prior to and following training: percent body fat, VO 2 <b>max,</b> isokinetic-maximal <b>torque</b> and avg. power at two speeds, 1 RM leg press, 1 RM bench press, vertical jump, lower body power (as calculated by the Lewis formula) and 40 -yard dash time. Results: Percent body fat was significantly (p&# 8804;. 05) decreased in both the ET and CT groups. Only the ET group significantly improved VO 2 max (+ 8. 24 %). Minimal changes were found for any of the isokinetic measurements. The ET, RT, and CT groups demonstrated significant improvements in leg press (20. 4, 40. 8, and 39. 4 %) and bench press (7. 5, 30. 5 and 21. 2 %) 1 RM. RT and CT 1 RM improvements were similar and significantly greater than the ET group. Only the RT group significantly increased power. No group showed a significant change in vertical jump or 40 -yard dash time. Conclusions: Findings indicate that endurance training does not interfere with strength development, but resistance training appears to hinder development of maximal aerobic capacity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare torque {{expression}} in active and passive self-ligating and conventional brackets. Methods: A total of 300 segments of stainless steel wire 0. 019 x 0. 025 -in and six different brands of brackets (Damon 3 MX, Portia, In-Ovation R, Bioquick, Roth SLI and Roth <b>Max)</b> were used. <b>Torque</b> moments were measured at 12 °, 24 °, 36 ° and 48 °, using a wire torsion device associated with a universal testing machine. The data obtained were compared by analysis of variance followed by Tukey test for multiple comparisons. Regression analysis was performed by the least-squares method to generate the mathematical equation of the optimal curve for each brand of bracket. Results: Statistically significant differences were observed in the expression of torque among all evaluated bracket brands in all evaluated torsions (p < 0. 05). It was found that Bioquick presented the lowest torque expression in all tested torsions; in contrast, Damon 3 MX bracket presented the highest torque expression up to 36 ° torsion. Conclusions: The connection system between wire/bracket (active, passive self-ligating or conventional with elastic ligature) seems not to interfere in the final torque expression, the latter being probably dependent on the interaction between the wire and the bracket chosen for orthodontic mechanics...|$|R

40|$|Ethylene-octene {{copolymers}} (EOCs) {{with two}} different octene contents (20 and 35 wt%) {{and the same}} melt flow index (3 g per 10 min) were cross-linked using various levels (0. 3, 0. 5 and 0. 7 wt%) of dicumyl peroxide at different temperatures. Cross-linking and degradation were analyzed by rubber process analyzer (RPA) within a temperature range of 150 - 200 °C. The highest s′ <b>max</b> (maximum elastic <b>torque)</b> and the lowest tan(delta) were found for EOC- 20 with low-octene content at all cross-linking temperatures. Lower peroxide efficiency was observed {{in the case of}} the high-octene copolymer. Increased degradation was observed with increasing cross-linking temperature. High-octene EOC was found to be more vulnerable to degradation. According to dynamic mechanical analysis, the storage modulus (M′) and the glass transition temperature (T g) obtained from the tan(delta) peaks were found to decrease with increasing octene content. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results show that the octene content has an inverse effect on the crystallinity (X) and melting point (T m) - due to the reduction in the average number of consecutive ethylene units. Creep testing at 150 °C confirmed the cross-linkability results obtained by RPA and the gel content analyses. Increased β-scission due to high numbers of tertiary carbon atoms present in the chain has resulted in the poorer cross-linking and inferior properties of high-octene EOC. © 2013 The Society of Polymer Science, Japan (SPSJ) All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The European Union Regulation 168 / 2013 {{requires}} an Effect Study {{to confirm the}} provisions (defined thereby and in Regulation 134 / 2014 [4]) for the type approval of the Euro 5 L-category vehicles (two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles, such as quads and minicars). The present report describes the testing methodology and preliminary results as input to the main Effect Study. Upon request of DG-GROWTH (Directorate General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs), the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) undertook an experimental campaign on 12 L-category vehicles to test their propulsion unit and environmental performance in line with a new paradigm: In principle, a vehicle should be clean and energy efficient in each and every operation point. In particular, vehicles belonging to the L-category family were tested over the current legislative test procedure, according to the future legislation contained in Regulation 168 / 2013 and during a wide open throttle test to assess the maximum performance of the vehicles (<b>max</b> power and <b>torque).</b> Several engine load variables were logged during the experimental testing: Second-by-second mass emissions of carbon dioxide, fuel consumption, power and torque at the wheel, throttle position, etc. The use of load variables is especially useful when on-road driving has to {{be compared to the}} legislative testing conditions. The new test cycle proposed for Euro 5 type approval, the Worldwide harmonized Motorcycle Test Cycle (WMTC) proved to be better than the present driving cycle in terms of quantity, quality and dynamics of testing/sampling points. The results related to the monitored load variables are vehicle specific and {{it was not possible to}} identify a single all-purpose fitting variable capable of describing engine load conditions during the test. Nevertheless the set of variables investigated in this work are promising and will be used as underpinnings for the Effect Study. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|R
40|$|The high {{prevalence}} of hamstring strain injury in sports, coupled with detrimental performance and financial effects of hamstring injuries, stress {{the necessity to}} implement an intervention capable of minimizing hamstring injuries for athletes. Nordic Hamstring eccentric strength training has shown itself {{to be an effective}} method of preventing hamstring injury. Eccentric strength training has also been shown to alter muscle architecture, joint stiffness, improve strength, and enhance dynamic performance, specifically vertical jump height. While there is limited research investigating the adaptations of the hamstrings to Nordic Hamstring training, determining these adaptations would allow for {{a better understanding of how}} the body responds to this injury-preventing stimulus. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of Nordic Hamstring eccentric strength training on hamstring muscle architecture, stiffness, strength, and dynamic performance. We hypothesized that Nordic Hamstring eccentric strength training will increase hamstring fascicle lengths and cross-sectional area, properties of muscle stiffness as measured by shear modulus and passive knee flexor torque, maximum torque and angle of <b>max</b> peak <b>torque,</b> and vertical jump height.   A total of 17 recreationally active, adult participants between the age of 18 and 21 were randomly assigned to control or experimental groups. Control subjects (n= 7) performed a warm-up and static stretching for 6 weeks while experimental subjects (n= 10) performed a warm-up, static stretching, and progressive Nordic Hamstring strength training for 6 weeks. Pre- and post-intervention measurements included: muscle architecture and stiffness of the biceps femoris long head using ultrasound imaging, maximal isokinetic and isometric hamstring strength measured on a dynamometer, and vertical jump height performance. Muscle volume and physiological cross-sectional area (PSCA) were calculated from the ultrasound measurements. Within and between groups two-way repeated measures ANOVAs were used to determine significant interactions and main effects with an alpha level of p< 0. 05.   The experimental group increased volume in both hamstring muscles (biceps femoris 11 %, semitendinosus 20 %), with a 12 % increase in PCSA for the biceps femoris long head muscle but not the semitendinosus (p< 0. 05). There were no changes to fascicle length, pennation angle, or stiffness that were unique to the experimental group. The 6 -week intervention did not produce any significant group by time interactions for concentric, isometric, eccentric strength measurements or peak passive torque measurements. Vertical jump height was also not affected by the intervention. Overall, the 6 -week Nordic Hamstring training intervention was a good training method for muscle growth and this adaptation in architecture translated to changes in eccentric hamstring muscle strength, although these changes did not reach statistical significance largely due to the dichotomy of responses in our training group. A sub-group analysis of the experimental subjects revealed apparent "responders" and "non-responders" to the training stimulus. From a clinically-relevant standpoint, the Nordic Hamstring training was 70 % effective at improving muscle function for participants in this study. Future exploration of the mechanics behind the Nordic Hamstring strength training exercise, shown to reduce hamstring injury, is a necessary step in understanding muscular adaptations to resistance exercise and enhancing training effectiveness on hamstring muscle function.   M.
