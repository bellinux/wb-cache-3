50|$|Diagnosis is {{currently}} through {{the elimination of}} other causes of infectious diseases with related symptoms like ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis or if the patient fails to respond to treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline. RT-PCR <b>may</b> then <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> detect viral ssRNA in the blood.

5|$|Furthermore, the kernel {{can keep}} {{separate}} mount tables for each process, and can thus provide each process {{with its own}} file system namespace.
