50|$|Due to the Great Derangement, many Acadians {{were invited}} to settle in Louisiana by the Spanish Governor Galvez. Unfamiliar with the terrain, they assimilated Creole and Native American {{influences}} into their Acadian traditions.. Cajun cuisine focused on local ingredients and wild game (e.g., duck, rabbit), vegetables (e.g., okra, <b>mirlitons),</b> and grains. Coastal communities relied heavily on fish and shellfish. Seafood, especially shellfish, is still very popular {{in the region and}} remains a dominant feature of many classic Cajun dishes like seafood gumbo and court boullion.|$|R

50|$|The hosho are Zimbabwean musical {{instruments}} {{consisting of a}} pair of maranka (mapudzi) gourds with seeds. They typically contain hota (Canna indica) seeds inside them. The hosho are used to accompany Shona music, especially mbira music. They make a rattling sound that western ears may be unaccustomed to hearing. However, this accompaniment is essential when playing mbira and/or marimba music. So essential, in fact, that extra vibrating elements such as <b>mirlitons</b> (buzzing membranes made from spider webs) are attached to the resonating tubes of marimbas and machachara (miniature Hosho made from seashells or bottle caps) are attached to the mbira and its deze. Mbiras and marimbas from Africa; and even other instruments, such as drums, will have some kind of rattles associated with their use.|$|R
5000|$|In 1954 Muir founded {{an amateur}} {{dramatic}} society, Thorpe Players, {{in the village}} of Thorpe, Surrey where he lived for many years. He was a writer and presenter on many shows, including the 1960s satire programmes That Was The Week That Was and The Frost Report. He was well known to television audiences as a team captain on the long-running BBC2 series Call My Bluff, and did voice-overs for advertisements, including Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit & Nut chocolate ("Everyone's a Fruit and Nut case", to the tune of the Danse des <b>mirlitons</b> from Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker), Batchelors' Savoury Rice ("Every grain will drive them insane!"), a coffee advert in which he used the phrase [...] "impending doom", and Unigate milk Humphreys.|$|R
50|$|The eunuch flute, or onion flute, or <b>mirliton</b> (Fr. flûte eunuque, flûte à l'oignon and mirliton; Ger. Zwiebelflöte) is {{a musical}} {{instrument}} of the woodwind family used during the 16th and 17th centuries, producing music akin to the comb-music of the nursery, and still manufactured as a toy ("mirliton").|$|E
50|$|The {{collection}} includes Le Cabaret du Chat Noir by Steinlen, Bruant au <b>Mirliton,</b> Le Divan Japonais or Le Moulin Rouge by Toulouse-Lautrec, La Place Pigalle by Maurice Utrillo, L’Autoportrait by Suzanne Valadon, Parce Domine by Willette, L’enseigne du Lapin Agile {{as well as}} {{the magnificent}} Théâtre d’ombres by Henri Rivière.|$|E

50|$|The bar was {{launched}} in 1926 as Cadbury's Fruit & Nut, but was renamed Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit & Nut in 2003. In the early years, {{along with the other}} Dairy Milk varieties, it was advertised as being essentially Dairy Milk with added ingredients. By the 1960s, each variety was advertised and branded separately, distancing itself from its Dairy Milk parent, in order to appeal to a younger market. The marketing approach produced a wide variety of wrappers and graphics. The famous Fruit and Nut television advert used the slogan 'Everyone's a fruit and nutcase', sung by humourist Frank Muir to the tune of the Danse des <b>mirlitons</b> from Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker. However, by the 1980s, Cadbury went full circle and all branding and wrappers were again realigned with the Dairy Milk family; all bars became predominantly purple and so were unmistakably Dairy Milk. In 2003 the move was further reinforced with a rebranding to Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit and Nut. The product wrapper uses the ampersand: Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit & Nut.|$|R
50|$|Williams {{wrote that}} many Vietnamese easily {{learned how to}} make king cakes since baguettes are a part of Vietnamese cuisine. Many New Orleans-area {{restaurants}} have two soups of the day, with one being a gumbo and the other being a pho. The pickled vegetables seen in banh mi are now available as fillings for po boys in traditional po boy restaurants. Many New Orleans restaurants also have chayote (<b>mirliton)</b> spring rolls.|$|E
50|$|The kazoo, {{also called}} Clegghorn, {{is based on}} the African <b>mirliton,</b> and was a popular African-American folk {{instrument}} during the 19th century. The manufactured version we know today was invented in Macon, Georgia, by an African American named Alabama Vest, in the 1840s. The first manufactured kazoo was made by Thaddeus Von Clegg, a German clockmaker in Georgia, and the instrument was introduced to the South at the Georgia State Fair in 1852.|$|E
50|$|Southern Louisiana is {{geographically}} {{and politically}} {{part of the}} South, but its cuisine is probably best understood as having only mild Southern influences. (Cajuns even prefer unsweetened tea.) Creole cuisine makes good use of many coastal animals—crawfish (commonly called crayfish outside the region), crab, oysters, shrimp, and saltwater fish. <b>Mirliton,</b> or chayote squash, is popular in Louisiana and harder to find {{in other parts of}} the South. Chicory coffee is sometimes preferred over the real thing—especially as an accompaniment to beignets.|$|E
50|$|Other series {{created by}} Macherot for Spirou include Pantoufle (with René Goscinny), <b>Mirliton</b> (with Raoul Cauvin), and as scenarist on Mulligan with Yvan Delporte and Isabelle, with Delporte and André Franquin. In the 1990s, Chaminou was revived, {{first by the}} team of Yann Lepennetier and Denis Bodart, and later by Olivier Saive, who {{completely}} redrew and augmented Chaminou et le Khrompire under Macherot's supervision, splitting it in two volumes. As for Sibylline, the series has been revived in 2006 by André Taymans for new adventures, also under Macherot's supervision.|$|E
50|$|In 1932 Muréna {{began to}} play the bandoneón in tango orchestras, {{including}} that of Rafael and Eduardo Bianco Canaro, at French clubs including La Boule Noire, Java, The Silhouette, Balajo (rue de Lappe), Pré Catelan and Ciro's. He also toured in South America, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. In 1949 he bought the Le <b>Mirliton</b> cabaret where he often played with Stephane Grappelli and Django Reinhardt. He also played with Matelo Ferret, Henri Crolla, Didi Duprat, Jo Privat and Gus Viseur. In 1958 he established the Radio Luxembourg Orchestra and also hosted the 36 Candles television show. He died in France.|$|E
5000|$|A flute {{is a type}} of aerophone, as is the Eunuch flute, also {{referred}} to as a <b>mirliton.</b> [...] A flute is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening. According to the instrument classification of Hornbostel-Sachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown aerophones. Aside from the voice, flutes are the earliest known musical instruments. A number of flutes dating to about 43,000 to 35,000 years ago have been found in the Swabian Alb region of Germany. These flutes demonstrate that a developed musical tradition existed from the earliest period of modern human presence in Europe.|$|E
50|$|At Gen Con in August 1996 it was {{revealed}} that the molds and master sculpts of Grenadier Models Inc. had been purchased by Stratelibri, their long-time distributor in Milan, Italy. The rights have since passed to <b>Mirliton</b> S.G. who continues to produce many of the figures from Grenadier's last years in business. Some of Grenadier's artists retained the right to their work. In 2001 Mega Miniatures purchased the production rights to 180 of the Julie Guthrie's Grenadier Personalities. Those 180 Grenadier Personalities were sold to Center Stage Miniatures in the fall of 2012. The production of all UK designed and sculpted miniatures are currently licensed to em4miniatures of Rustington, West Sussex, England by the holder of those rights.|$|E
5000|$|Fabio Lombardi (born in 1961) is an Italian {{ethnomusicologist}} and organologist who studied, at the Bologna University, with Roberto Leydi, Tullia Magrini and the organologist Febo Guizzi.Born in Meldola, Romagna, in the 1980s he made {{an ethnic}} musical field research in Emilia-Romagna, near Forlì and along the Bidente valley (Meldola, Cusercoli, Bertinoro, Predappio, Forlimpopoli, Civitella, Galeata, Santa Sofia, Bagno di Romagna) which has contributed to a better knowledge of Italian ethnic music (music of Italy), particularly regarding musical instruments: he discovered some unknown ethnic instruments (ethnic instrument) both in Italy and Europe.For example, see: a type of <b>mirliton</b> improperly named [...] "Ocarina" [...] kazoo.Other Lombardi's works are on the local history of Meldola, Riccione, Forlì and other topics.|$|E
