5|$|During CENTCOM {{military}} exercises in July 1990 termed Internal Look '90, Schwarzkopf wrote up {{a scenario that}} tested how the command would respond to a regional dictator invading a neighboring country and threatening oil fields there, a scenario which closely <b>mirrored</b> <b>the</b> rising tension between Iraq and Kuwait. One week {{after the end of}} these exercises, Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) distracts {{himself from}} his romantic {{problems}} by attempting to resolve a dispute between two janitors (Bawa and Ramsaywack). Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is offended when she learns that her employees hang out outside of work but do not invite her. This episode of 30 Rock closely <b>mirrored</b> <b>the</b> feud between television hosts Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} {{a mix of}} simulation and arcade style boxing. The storyline, which unfolds in the story mode, takes place in six linear segments that originally overlapped in the manga. The game's fights <b>mirrored</b> <b>the</b> fights from the manga series. The beginning of the game focuses on Ippo Makunouchi's rise to the Japanese Featherweight championship, and later switches to Ippo's fellow gym mates' careers.|$|E
50|$|The park {{features}} a layout that <b>mirrors</b> <b>the</b> neighboring Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. <b>The</b> brick sidewalks <b>mirror</b> <b>the</b> walls and nave {{of the cathedral}} while a semicircular colonnade featuring fountains <b>mirrors</b> <b>the</b> apse.|$|R
50|$|Looking {{through a}} mirror from {{different}} positions (but necessarily {{with the point}} of observation restricted to the halfspace {{on one side of}} <b>the</b> <b>mirror)</b> is like looking at <b>the</b> 3D <b>mirror</b> image of space; without further <b>mirrors</b> only <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> image of <b>the</b> halfspace before <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> is relevant; if there is another <b>mirror,</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> image of <b>the</b> other halfspace is too.|$|R
25|$|A {{plane mirror}} forms a virtual image {{positioned}} behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> Although <b>the</b> rays of light {{seem to come}} from behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> light from <b>the</b> source only exists in front of <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> image in a plane mirror is not magnified (that is, the image is {{the same size as}} the object) and appears to be as far behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> as <b>the</b> object is in front of <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|R
5|$|While the {{religious}} hierarchy <b>mirrored</b> <b>the</b> Empire's administrative divisions, the clergy were more ubiquitous than the emperor's servants. The issue of caesaropapism, while {{usually associated with}} the Byzantine Empire, is now understood to be an oversimplification of actual conditions in the Empire. By the fifth century, the Patriarch of Constantinople was recognized as first among equals of the four eastern Patriarchs and as of equal status with the Pope in Rome.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the war began, the Chartered Company formed the Rhodesian Reserves, an {{amorphous}} entity intended to accommodate the many white men who were keen to put on uniform, as well as to make a start towards organising what might eventually become an expeditionary force. Eminent citizens and elected leaders formed their own platoons, each bringing 24 volunteers; three or four of these 25-man troops made a company. Units representing the Caledonian Society, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Society, the Legion of Frontiersmen and other local organisations <b>mirrored</b> <b>the</b> Pals battalions in Britain. Volunteers could opt to serve overseas, within Rhodesia or only locally; around 1,000 had volunteered in all by 13 August.|$|E
5|$|Following the battle, Santa Anna was {{alternately}} {{viewed as}} a national hero or a pariah. Mexican perceptions of the battle often <b>mirrored</b> <b>the</b> prevailing viewpoint. Santa Anna had been disgraced following his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto, and many Mexican accounts of the battle were written by men who had been, or had become, his outspoken critics. Petite and many other historians believe {{that some of the}} stories, such as the execution of Crockett, may have been invented to further discredit Santa Anna. In Mexican history, the Texas campaign, including the Battle of the Alamo, was soon overshadowed by the Mexican–American War of 1846–48.|$|E

50|$|For flat <b>mirrors,</b> <b>the</b> law of {{reflection}} implies that images of objects are upright {{and the same}} distance behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> as <b>the</b> objects are in front of <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> image size {{is the same as}} the object size. (The magnification of a flat mirror is equal to one.) The law also implies that mirror images are parity inverted, which is perceived as a left-right inversion.|$|R

5|$|Harry Potter pundit John Granger {{additionally}} {{noted that}} one of the reasons the Harry Potter books were so popular is their use of literary alchemy (similar to Romeo and Juliet, C. S. Lewis's Perelandra and Charles Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities) and vision symbolism. In this model, authors weave allegorical tales along the alchemical magnum opus. Since the medieval period, alchemical allegory has <b>mirrored</b> <b>the</b> passion, death and resurrection of Christ. While the entire series utilises symbols common in alchemy, the Deathly Hallows completes this cycle, tying themes of death, rebirth, and the Resurrection Stone to the principal motif of alchemical allegory, and topics presented in the first book of the series.|$|E
5|$|Miller's form <b>mirrored</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of the}} Hibs team as it {{went into}} a slump in 2010, leading to the {{departure}} of Hughes. New manager Colin Calderwood signed three new midfielders in January 2011 and left Miller out of the starting lineup for two games soon afterwards. Calderwood expressed hope that improved results would bring better form out of Miller, who he described as a top-level player. Miller {{expressed a desire to}} stay at Hibs in March 2011, but the two parties did not agree a new contract, which allowed him to leave the club.|$|E
5|$|Norman wore {{a variety}} of brightly colored, {{elaborate}} costumes and was often photographed by media while wearing royal-style gowns and wigs and holding a scepter. She stated that her habiliments <b>mirrored</b> <b>the</b> practices of extraterrestrials, whose attire she said was brighter and more radiant than clothing on Earth. At the group's headquarters, she had a gold-colored throne that was decorated with peacock feathers. Her assistants helped shepherd her media image; Kirkpatrick and Tumminia speculate that her charisma was primarily responsible for gaining publicity for the group.|$|E

50|$|A mirror {{does not}} just produce {{an image of}} what would be there without it; it also changes the light {{distribution}} in the halfspace in front of and behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> A <b>mirror</b> hanging on <b>the</b> wall makes the room brighter because additional light sources appear in <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> image. However, <b>the</b> appearance of additional light does not violate the conservation of energy principle, because some light no longer reaches behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> as <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> simply re-directs <b>the</b> light energy. In terms of the light distribution, <b>the</b> virtual <b>mirror</b> image has <b>the</b> same appearance and the same effect as a real, symmetrically arranged half-space behind a window (instead of <b>the</b> <b>mirror).</b> Shadows may extend from <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> into <b>the</b> halfspace before it, and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|Inkjet {{printers}} are {{not capable}} of printing white.

Inkjet transfer paper for dark garments is covered with transferable white ink. For dark garments, the image is printed without mirroring.|$|R
5|$|By 1908, Piemonte {{had been}} {{assigned}} as the flagship of the torpedo flotilla of the main fleet, which consisted of seventeen destroyers and fifty first and second class torpedo boats. In August that year, Piemonte participated in the annual summer maneuvers of the Italian fleet. She was assigned to a squadron and was tasked with defending against an opponent fleet that attempted to force an amphibious landing. The maneuvers were modeled on a potential war with Italy's nominal ally Austria-Hungary, {{and the fact that}} the relative strengths of the two squadrons <b>mirrored</b> <b>the</b> Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies was not lost on analysts in Vienna. The Maneuvers concluded with a fleet review on 18 October. Piemonte then spent 1909 deployed again to the Far East.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Hull City's first shirt badge <b>mirrored</b> <b>the</b> {{familiar}} three crowns civic {{emblem of}} Kingston-upon-Hull, which was {{displayed on the}} sky blue shirts worn in the 1935–36 season. Following that season, the team went without wearing a badge until 1947, when the club crest depicted a tiger's head in an orange-shaded badge. This was worn up until 1957, when it was changed to just the tiger's head. This was worn for three years, when the shirt again featured no emblem. Then, in 1971, the club returned to showing the tiger's head on the shirt. This was used for four years, until the club's initials of HCAFC were shown for four years. After this, a logo with the tiger's head with the club's name underneath was used from 1979 until 1998. The next logo, which remains the club's current logo, features the tiger's head in an amber shield with the club's name, along with the club's nickname, The Tigers.|$|E
5|$|In late May and June 1941, {{members of}} the Provincial Committee for Bosnia-Herzegovina {{travelled}} to the oblast (regional) centres of Banja Luka in the Bosanska Krajina region, Mostar in Herzegovina, and Tuzla in the Birač region of eastern Bosnia to advise the oblast KPJ committees of {{the decisions of the}} Central Committee, and to form oblast military committees. This also occurred in Sarajevo, for an oblast military committee responsible for the Romanija region of eastern Bosnia located north of that city. Each oblast military committee formed district military committees, who in turn contacted KPJ members in towns and villages of their district to organise resistance. This pyramid-like structure <b>mirrored</b> <b>the</b> KPJ structure, and following the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June, the Central Committee met on 4 July and decided to initiate an armed uprising against the occupiers. This included the creation of a formal military structure, headed by the General Staff for the People's Liberation Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito, who was also the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the KPJ.|$|E

5|$|On Election Day, Perot {{finished}} {{in third place}} behind Clinton (the winner) and Bush. Perot received 19,743,821 votes, which accounted for 18.91% of the popular vote. He failed to win any states in the Electoral College because of the relatively even distribution of his support, but did win over 30% {{of the vote in}} Maine and 27% in Utah, finishing second in both states. Perot was the first third party candidate since George Wallace in 1968 to finish first in a county, winning counties in Alaska (divided into boroughs), California, Nevada, Colorado, Kansas, Texas and Maine. He won his largest percentage in Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska and Loving County, Texas with over 40%. According to exit polls, 52% of Perot's supporters were male, 94% were white, 63% were aged between 18 and 44, and about 2/3 had not received a college degree. The income of supporters <b>mirrored</b> <b>the</b> general public. In terms of ideology, 53% identified as moderates, 27% were conservative and 20% were liberal, while two-thirds were either members of the Democratic Party or were politically independent.|$|E
5|$|The post-First World War years {{marked a}} decline in Welsh rugby. An {{industrial}} recession struck the principality, and hurt South Wales in particular. Welsh international results in the 1920s <b>mirrored</b> <b>the</b> performance of the economy: of their 42 matches they won only 17, with three drawn. Half-a-million people emigrated from Wales to find work elsewhere during the depression; this included many Welsh rugby union internationals {{who moved to the}} professional code of rugby league. Between 1923 and 1928, Wales managed only seven victories – five of them against France. However, even France managed to defeat Wales that decade; achieving their first victory over Wales in 1928. Welsh selection policy reflected the upheavals of the mid-1920s. In 1924, 35 different players were selected for Wales' four matches, with a different captain for each; and only Edward Watkins in the backs and Charlie Pugh in the forwards, playing in all four matches.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also saw}} a {{significant}} expansion in Georgia Tech's postgraduate education programs, driven largely by the Cold War and the launch of Sputnik; this effort received substantial support from the EES. Despite its slow start, with the first Master of Science programs in the 1920s and the first Doctorate in 1946, the program became firmly established. In 1952 alone, around 80 students earned graduate degrees while working at EES. Herschel H. Cudd, EES director from 1952 to 1954, created a new promotion system for researchers that is still in use. Many EES researchers held the title of professor despite lacking a doctorate (or a comparable qualification for promotion {{as determined by the}} Georgia Board of Regents), something that irritated members of the teaching faculty. The new system, approved in spring 1953, used the Board of Regents' qualifications for promotion and <b>mirrored</b> <b>the</b> academic tenure track.|$|E

5|$|Worcestershire had {{an unusually}} large number of exclaves (see Fig 1), which were {{cut off from the}} main county and {{completely}} surrounded by the nearby counties of Warwickshire, Staffordshire, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire (Detached) and Oxfordshire. This relationship with neighbouring counties <b>mirrored</b> <b>the</b> confusing and fragmented layout of parishes within Worcestershire's own hundreds (See images and table below). The most notable islands were Dudley, Evenlode, Blockley and the area around Shipston-on-Stour. Herefordshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Shropshire had their own exclaves within the main part of Worcestershire at Rochford, Broome, Clent, Tardebigge (Tutnall and Cobley) and Halesowen respectively. Tardebigge's history outside the county is even more colourful, changing hands from Worcestershire to Staffordshire and Warwickshire, before returning to Worcestershire at differing times over the centuries. The southern boundary of the county was also complex, with parish boundaries penetrating deep into Gloucestershire and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the rest}} of Italy, the finest and most {{decorated}} rooms were those on the piano nobile, reserved for guests and entertaining. Entered formally from the external Baroque double staircase, these rooms consisted of a suite of large and small salons, with one very large salon being the principal room of the house, often used as a ballroom. Sometimes the guest bedrooms were sited here too, {{but by the end of}} the 18th century they were more often on a secondary floor above. If decorated during the Baroque era, the rooms would be profusely ornamented. Walls were frequently <b>mirrored,</b> <b>the</b> mirrors inset into gilded frames in the walls, often alternating with paintings similarly framed, while moulded nymphs and shepherdesses decorated the spaces between. Ceilings were high and frescoed, and from the ceiling hung huge coloured chandeliers of Murano glass, while further light came from gilded sconces flanking the mirrors adorning the walls. One of the most notable rooms in this style is the Gallery of Mirrors in Palermo's Palazzo Valguarnera-Gangi (Illustration 17). This room with its frescoed ceiling by Gaspare Fumagalli is, however, one of the few Baroque rooms in this Baroque palazzo, which was (from 1750) extended and transformed by its owner Marianna Valguarnera, mostly in the later neoclassical style.|$|E
5|$|The mounted police {{influenced}} {{the creation of}} other imperial units during the conflict. Lord Strathcona, the Canadian High Commissioner in London, raised a unit of mounted infantry modelled on the force, believing this would be particularly suitable for taking on Boer scouting parties. Thirty-three serving members of the police joined the unit, including Superintendent Samuel Steel, who became their commanding officer. The Strathconas wore the mounted police's Stetson hat {{as part of their}} uniform, while in turn their distinctive boots were adopted by the police as their official footwear in 1901. The South African Constabulary was created in October 1900 to police the recaptured territories; it <b>mirrored</b> <b>the</b> mounted police, with its members again wearing the force's Stetson hat; it incorporated forty-two members of the mounted police and one of its divisions was commanded by Steele. The mounted police volunteers suffered seven casualties during the conflict. Sergeant Arthur Richardson, a member of the Strathconas, won the Victoria Cross for rescuing a Canadian soldier under heavy fire at Wolve Spruit. In 1904, the Crown renamed the force the Royal North-West Mounted Police to honour its contributions in the war.|$|E
