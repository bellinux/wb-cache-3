5|$|On February 2, 2011, the 1,000th 767 rolled out, {{destined for}} All Nippon Airways. The {{aircraft}} was the 91st 767-300ER {{ordered by the}} Japanese carrier, and with its completion the 767 became the second wide-body airliner to reach the thousand-unit milestone after the 747. The 1,000th aircraft also marked the last model produced on the original 767 assembly line. Beginning with the 1,001st aircraft, production moved to another area in the Everett factory which occupied {{about half of the}} previous floor space. The new assembly line made room for 787 production and aimed to boost <b>manufacturing</b> <b>efficiency</b> by over twenty percent.|$|E
25|$|The {{photovoltaic}} effect is {{the transformation of}} light into electrical energy, as in solar cells. Photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly to electricity. Although sunlight is free and abundant, solar electricity is still usually more expensive to produce than large-scale mechanically generated power due {{to the cost of}} the panels. Low-efficiency silicon solar cells have been decreasing in cost and multijunction cells with close to 30% conversion efficiency are now commercially available. Over 40% efficiency has been demonstrated in experimental systems. Until recently, photovoltaics were most commonly used in remote sites where there is no access to a commercial power grid, or as a supplemental electricity source for individual homes and businesses. Recent advances in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>efficiency</b> and photovoltaic technology, combined with subsidies driven by environmental concerns, have dramatically accelerated the deployment of solar panels. Installed capacity is growing by 40% per year led by increases in Germany, Japan, and the United States.|$|E

50|$|His {{approach}} {{worked well}} in the increasingly mature business world {{of the second half}} of the twentieth century. By that time large corporations had developed the basic <b>manufacturing</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and managerial hierarchies of mass production. Executives thought they knew how to run companies, and Drucker took it upon himself to poke holes in their beliefs, lest organizations become stale. But he did so in a sympathetic way. He assumed that his readers were intelligent, rational, hardworking people of good will. If their organizations struggled, he believed it was usually because of outdated ideas, a narrow conception of problems, or internal misunderstandings.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} project discusses {{the economic impact}} on human resources management or HRM practices in Taiwan within the nation‟s information and technology (IT) sector. The project begins by establishing {{the framework of the}} study which identifies Taiwan‟s technology sector as the target and HRM as the performance factor within the industry. The project continues by illustrating a clear precedent for human resource factors having an influence on overall firm performance in most industries and particularly in the technology sector. This link is made because the IT industry relies so heavily on intellectual property and research and development or R&D which drives firm performance. While operational factors such as <b>manufacturing</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are critical, HRM is viewed as one critical field in which a technology firm can achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. It {{is due to the fact}} that IT solutions are broadly available to virtually any IT competitor making the market strategy options of these firms largely dependent upon the human performance factors within the firms themselves. A single Taiwan based technology firm receives the brunt of the analysis, HTC, which competes in the mobile device industry and primarily that of the wireless handset market. HTC is viewed as an innovative technology firm because while it takes advantage of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>efficiencies</b> gained in international low cost markets such as China, it also empowers its design engineers and product specialists to take risks. The study concludes by recognizing that HRM provides a solution for Taiwan‟s technology firms to not only survive the current global recession but to also thrive and potentially emerge as more dominant global players as is the case with HTC...|$|R
