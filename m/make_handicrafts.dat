40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the utilisation of wetland plant resources for livelihood and income generation in Swaziland. The study was carried out at Lobamba Lomdzala area located in the middleveld of Swaziland. The area has about 13500 inhabitants with 2000 homesteads. A questionnaire was administered to 92 randomly selected homesteads within the area. Information collected included type of wetland plant resources harvested and income generated from wetland plant resources. About 85 % of the respondents collected wild fruits for domestic use and for sale. The dominant wild fruits collected were Syzygium cordatum, Vangueria spp and Ficus spp. The monthly income from sale of the fruits varied, with the highest being R 900 (US$ 120) per homestead. Forty respondents (43 %) collected indigenous medicinal plants for income generation and another 40 % collected them for own use. The dominant indigenous medicinal plants collected were Helichrysum rugulosum and Hypoxis hemerocallidea. The monthly income from harvested medicinal plants ranged from R 100 to R 600 per homestead. All the homesteads interviewed collected plant material for craftw ork, with the dominant plant species collected being Cyperus latifolius, Cyperus articulatus, Festuca costata and Coleochloa setifera. The material was either sold or used to <b>make</b> <b>handicraft</b> or shared with neighbours. The annual income from selling handicraft material and finished products ranged from R 200 to R 4000 per homestead. Phragmites spp was collected and used as building material by three homesteads. Thirty homesteads harvested it and delivered it to the Queen Mother’s (Indlovukati) home for traditional and cultural use. The results demonstrated that wetland resources were a source of income for rural homesteads in Swaziland. Their cultural and/or religious significance is well appreciated in the Swazi tradition. It is concluded that wetlands need to be protected from threats of degradation due to overgrazing of livestock, overexploitation and drainage to pave way for agricultural and other uses...|$|R
5000|$|The {{people of}} Kangpara {{along with the}} people of Kheng are renowned {{throughout}} the country for their unparalleled craftsmanship. The most exquisite handicraft product the artisans produce is called [...] "Bangchung". The raw material used to <b>make</b> <b>handicrafts</b> like Bangchung is called [...] "Ringshu" [...] (Neomicrocalamus and ropogonifolius), which they fetch in bulk from places like Remung, under Orong Gewog, S/Jongkhar. Handicrafts are a major source of income for the people of Kangpara, and they market their finished products {{to other parts of the}} country in exchange for hard currency. The connecting of the farm road to the gewog is likely to further ease artisans of the gewog in fetching raw materials and transporting their finished products. Almost all denizens of the gewog are subsistence farmers and, until recently, barter played a significant role among the people and, to a lesser extent, it is still prevalent. Farmers cultivate crops like chillies, paddy and maize, of which, chillies are essentially cultivated to earn some cash income and the latter two for domestic consumption. They use ponies as a means of transportation to sell their products to the market, and therefore, it is no accident that almost every household owns a pony or mule each. Also, a relatively small percentage of the population, precisely in the north, are nomads and livestock farming plays a dominant role in their everyday life; for them, livestock and livestock products are the only means where-through they can scrape out a living.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{study the}} effect of living in an {{internally}} displaced people’s (IDP) camp on economic activity choices in post war northern Uganda. As the decision to relocate from a camp is voluntary, camp residents may be different from returnees. We merge household data with micro-level conflict data to control for endogeneity (selection of households out from camps). We find a strong effect of camp residence on activity choices. Particularly, individuals in IDP camps {{are more inclined to}} cultivate and engage in trading, than those who returned. However {{they are less likely to}} <b>make</b> <b>handicrafts</b> and participate in any of the wide range of activities. The observation that individuals living in camps strive to ensure selfreliance underscores the need for livelihood interventions and other recovery programmes to target not only returnee households but also create opportunities for households still in displacement. This should be coupled with improvement of security around camps to foster increased economic activity. Results also point to the need to fast-track infrastructure development and stimulate local demand that allows returnees to self-sustain...|$|E

Jhai had been working with the villagers to dig wells and <b>make</b> <b>handicrafts.</b> But what the villagers were crying out for was access to the internet. Jhai enlisted some of the sharpest minds in Silicon Valley to devise a machine that could operate in harsh conditions and with no technical support. Instead of a hard drive with moving and delicate parts, the Jhai PC relies on flash memory chips to store data. The PC is assembled from off-the-shelf components and uses less than 20 watts during normal use. The machine is so rugged its creators say it can survive dirt, heat and even immersion in water. And the power supply? The solution is simple: pedal power. Because of its simplicity, the Jhai PC can be powered by a car battery charged with bicycle cranks. Each village PC is connected via wireless Internet cards to a solar-powered hilltop relay station, which passes the signal on to the nearest town of Phon Hong, 30 km away.

Copernicia tectorum has the fastest leaf production rate recorded for any palm (19 - 23 leaves/year in subadults and adults), and a short life span of ca. 46 years. The abundance, density and high leaf production rate of this palm offer a great potential for the sustainable use of its unexpanded leaves (especially at Plato, where there are ca. 480 ha of palm stands with 300 - 1 000 individuals/ha), as leaf harvest from subadult and adult individuals {{does not appear to}} affect population structure.
