The 655 was officially released in 1973 as the Honeywell 6070 (with reduced performance versions, the 6030 and 6050). An optional Decimal/Business instruction set {{was added to}} improve COBOL performance. (Extended Instruction Set, aka EIS and the Decimal Unit or DU). The machines with EIS were the 'even' series, the 6040, 6060, 6080 and later the 6025. Several hundred of these processors were sold. Memory was initially 600 ns Ferrite core made by Lockheed.

5000|$|The {{computer}} {{was to be}} delivered in December 1972, and Gernelle, Lacombe, Benchetrit and Beckmann had {{to work in a}} cellar in Châtenay-Malabry for 18 hours a day in order to deliver the computer in time. The software, the ROM-based MIC 01 monitor and the ASMIC 01 assembler, was written on an Intertechnique Multi-8 minicomputer using a cross assembler. The {{computer was}} based on an Intel 8008 microprocessor clocked at 500 kHz. It had a backplane bus, called the Pluribus with 74-pin connector. 14 boards could be plugged in a Pluribus. With two Pluribus, the Micral N could support up to 24 boards. The computer used <b>MOS</b> <b>memory</b> instead of core memory. The Micral N could support parallel and serial input/output. It had 8 levels of interrupt and a stack. The computer was programmed with punched tape, and used a teleprinter or modem for I/O. The front panel console was optional, offering customers the option of designing their own console to match a particular application. [...] It was delivered to the INRA in January 1973, and commercialized in February 1973 for FF 8,500 (about $1,750) making it a cost-effective replacement for minicomputers which augured the era of the PC.|$|E
5000|$|Core {{memory is}} {{non-volatile}} storage—it can retain its contents indefinitely without power. It is also relatively unaffected by EMP and radiation. These were important advantages for some applications like first-generation industrial programmable controllers, military installations and vehicles like fighter aircraft, {{as well as}} spacecraft, and led to core being used {{for a number of}} years after availability of semiconductor <b>MOS</b> <b>memory</b> (see also MOSFET). For example, the Space Shuttle flight computers initially used core memory, which preserved the contents of memory even through the Challengers disintegration and subsequent plunge into the sea in 1986.Another characteristic of early core was that the coercive force was very temperature-sensitive; the proper half-select current at one temperature is not the proper half-select current at another temperature. So a memory controller would include a temperature sensor (typically a thermistor) to adjust the current levels correctly for temperature changes. An example of this is the core memory used by Digital Equipment Corporation for their PDP-1 computer; this strategy continued through all of the follow-on core memory systems built by DEC for their PDP line of air-cooled computers. Another method of handling the temperature sensitivity was to enclose the magnetic core [...] "stack" [...] in a temperature controlled oven. Examples of this are the heated-air core memory of the IBM 1620 (which could take up to 30 minutes to reach operating temperature, about 106 F and the heated-oil-bath core memory of the IBM 7090, early IBM 7094s, and IBM 7030.|$|E

5000|$|The first depletion-load nMOS {{circuits}} were pioneered {{and made}} by the DRAM manufacturer Mostek, which made depletion-mode transistors available {{for the design of}} the original Zilog Z80 in 1975-76.

At Intel, depletion load was introduced in 1974 by Federico Faggin, an ex-Fairchild engineer and later the founder of Zilog. Depletion-load was first employed for a redesign of one of Intel's most important products at the time, a +5V-only 1Kbit nMOS SRAM called the 2102 (using more than 6000 transistors). The result of this redesign was the significantly faster 2102A, where the highest performing versions of the chip had access times of less than 100ns, taking <b>MOS</b> <b>memories</b> close to the speed of bipolar RAMs for the first time.|$|R

40|$|Flash memory devices—that is, {{non-volatile}} {{computer storage}} media that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed—are vital for portable electronics, but the scaling down of metal–oxide–semiconductor (<b>MOS)</b> flash <b>memory</b> to sizes of below ten nanometres per data cell presents challenges. Molecules have been proposed to replace <b>MOS</b> flash <b>memory</b> 1, but they suffer from low electrical conductivity, high resistance, low device yield, and finite thermal stability, limiting their integration into current MOS technologies. Although great advances {{have been made in}} the pursuit of molecule-based flash memory 2, there are a number of significant barriers to the realization of devices using conventional MOS technologies 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Here we show that core–shell polyoxometalate (POM) molecules 8 can act as candidate storage nodes for <b>MOS</b> flash <b>memory.</b> Realistic, industry-standard device simulations validate our approach at the nanometre scale, where the device performance is determined mainly by the number of molecules in the storage media and not by their position. To exploit the nature of the core–shell POM clusters, we show, at both the molecular and device level, that embedding [(Se(IV) O 3) 2] 4 − as an oxidizable dopant in the cluster core allows the oxidation of the molecule to a [Se(V) 2 O 6] 2 − moiety containing a {Se(V) –Se(V) } bond (where curly brackets indicate a moiety, not a molecule) and reveals a new 5 + oxidation state for selenium. This new oxidation state can be observed at the device level, resulting in a new type of memory, which we call ‘write-once-erase’. Taken together, these results show that POMs have the potential to be used as a realistic nanoscale flash memory. Also, the configuration of the doped POM core may lead to new types of electrical behaviour 9, 10, 11.
