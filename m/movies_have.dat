5|$|From their {{beginnings}} to {{the present}} day, B <b>movies</b> <b>have</b> provided opportunities both for those {{coming up in the}} profession and others whose careers are waning.

5|$|A {{total of}} 65 ABC affiliates—28% of the network—did not clear the {{available}} timeslot for the film, {{even with the}} offer of The Walt Disney Company, ABC's parent, to pay all fines for language to the Federal Communications Commission.
