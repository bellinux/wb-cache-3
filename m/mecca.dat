5|$|A year later, in 630, the Muslims {{advanced}} from Medina {{to conquer}} <b>Mecca.</b> In the Conquest of <b>Mecca</b> Khalid commanded {{one of the}} four Muslims armies that entered <b>Mecca</b> from four different routes, and routed the Qurayshi cavalry. Later that year, he participated in the Battle of Hunayn and the Siege of Ta'if.|$|E
5|$|Between 1932 and 1934, {{the road}} east of <b>Mecca</b> had been paved. The {{western part of}} the road, known as the Box Canyon road, from <b>Mecca</b> to Blythe served as part of US 60 and US 70 until it was {{eventually}} bypassed in favor of a more direct route to Indio, diverging at Shavers' Summit. Between 1934 and 1936, US 60 and US 70 had made the shift north towards Indio, and the portion between US 99 and <b>Mecca</b> was paved. Initial opposition was later overcome after the road was washed out during a storm and forced motorists to take refuge in the nearby foothills. By 1940, the SR 195 designation was signed. In the 1940s, the highway continued due west of <b>Mecca</b> to end at an intersection with US 99, rather than turning south.|$|E
5|$|Bramatyo {{cast his}} wife, Zaskia Adya <b>Mecca,</b> as Ahmad Dahlan's wife Siti Walidah— <b>Mecca</b> {{also served as}} casting director, in charge of auditioning the {{supporting}} cast. Before filming began, <b>Mecca</b> attempted to research the biographies of Dahlan and his wife, as she and the other young actors did not {{know much about the}} couple. However, she found such research difficult as the libraries did not have the information she needed.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad had preached the {{religion}} of Islam in <b>Mecca</b> from 613 to 622. He had attracted a small community of followers, but also drew staunch opposition {{from the rest of}} the Quraysh, the tribe that ruled <b>Mecca</b> and to which he belonged. The Muslims fled <b>Mecca</b> in 622 after years of persecution and established themselves at Medina (formerly known as Yathrib; Medina means City). The Quraysh had seized the properties and families of Muslims in <b>Mecca</b> and dispatched caravans to Damascus which the Muslims intercepted and raided. The Meccans sent out a small army to punish the Muslims and stop their raiding. At the Battle of Badr in 623, a small Muslim force defeated the much larger Meccan army.|$|E
5|$|Route 64, {{a highway}} from <b>Mecca</b> to Blythe, {{was added to}} the state highway system in 1919. In 1935, Pierce Street from Route 26 near Oasis to Avenue 66, and Avenue 66 from Route 26 to <b>Mecca</b> were added to the state highway system. Two years later, Pierce Street was {{designated}} as Route 203, and Avenue 66 was designated as Route 204. By 1926, the road existed east of <b>Mecca</b> to Blythe, but was unpaved; by 1930, the road connected from <b>Mecca</b> to the road along the western side of the Salton Sea to Indio and points further west.|$|E
5|$|Some western {{scholars}} {{hold that}} the Isra and Mi'raj journey traveled through the heavens from the sacred enclosure at <b>Mecca</b> to the celestial al-Baytu l-Maʿmur (heavenly {{prototype of the}} Kaaba); later traditions indicate Muhammad's journey as having been from <b>Mecca</b> to Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|By 1928 he was {{reportedly}} working on film adaptations of the folktales Roro Mendut and Prono Tjitro, {{although it is}} not known if he finished them. He did, however, complete a documentary entitled Het Groote Mekka-Feest (The Great <b>Mecca</b> Feast) which followed hajj pilgrims from the Indies during their trip to <b>Mecca.</b> The film premiered in Leiden, the Netherlands, on November 8, 1928. This premiere was attended by numerous Dutch socialites, including Princess Juliana, and given an introduction by Dutch Orientalist Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{migration}} of Muhammad from <b>Mecca</b> to Medina, many battles were fought between the new Muslim community at Medina and the confederacy of the Quraysh. Khalid {{did not participate in}} the Battle of Badr—the first battle fought between Muslims and Qurayshites—but his brother Walid ibn Walid was caught and made a prisoner. Khalid and his elder brother Hasham ibn Walid went to Medina to ransom Walid, but soon after he was ransomed, Walid, amidst the journey back to <b>Mecca,</b> escaped and went back to Muhammad and converted to Islam.|$|E
5|$|Holland {{looks at}} the {{earliest}} evidence for Muhammad, <b>Mecca</b> and Islam {{in the first century}} of the Arab Empire, pointing to a lack of evidence in the historical record to support the traditional account. Highlighting that very little Muslim testimony from the 7th century exists, he considers it suspect that 30 years after Muhammad's death, Muawiyah I became leader of the Arab Empire in Jerusalem despite showing little sign of being Muslim, and that no mention of Muhammad or Islam can be found in any of Muawiyah's inscriptions, coins, or documents. Holland proceeds to note that {{with the exception of a}} single ambiguous reference in the Qur'an, there is no mention of <b>Mecca</b> in any datable text for a century after Muhammed's death. He points out that in the Qur'an, the Prophet appears to address farmers and agriculturalists while his opponents are described as keeping cattle and growing olives and vines. This appears to describe an environment foreign to <b>Mecca,</b> where there was no agriculture; thus Holland posits that the location attributed to <b>Mecca</b> in the Qur'an more closely fits a city in the Negev desert, in what is now southern Israel.|$|E
5|$|If {{unable to}} leave on the 12th before sunset or opt {{to stay at}} free will, they must perform the stoning ritual again on the 13th before {{returning}} to <b>Mecca.</b>|$|E
5|$|Learning {{of these}} events, al-Hakim wrote to Mufarrij and reproached him, {{demanding}} the safe return of Yarukh to Egypt, {{while at the}} same time offering the sum of 50,000 dinars if the Jarrahids would again submit. Abu'l-Qasim, who feared that Mufarrij was inclined to accept, persuaded Hassan to have Yarukh executed. The Jarrahids followed this open act of rebellion by recognizing an anti-caliph in the person of the Alid Sharif of <b>Mecca,</b> Abu'l-Futuh al-Hasan ibn Ja'far, in July 1012. Abu'l-Qasim himself journeyed to <b>Mecca,</b> where he persuaded Abu'l-Futuh to accept the role. The latter, assuming the title of al-Rashid bi'llah ("Righteous with God"), succeeded in winning the recognition of the holy cities of <b>Mecca</b> and Medina, and went to Ramlah. On his arrival there in September, he was greeted with jubilation by the Bedouin, and the local preacher read the Friday prayer in his name.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Seljuks were {{advancing}} towards al-Jazira, and {{the descendants}} of Qatada ibn Idris fought with their Ayyubid overlords over control of <b>Mecca.</b> The conflict between them was taken advantage of by the Rasulids of Yemen who attempted to end Ayyubid suzerainty in the Hejaz and bring the region under their control which they accomplished in 1238 when Nur al-Din Umar captured <b>Mecca.</b>|$|E
5|$|Muhammad {{instructed}} {{his followers}} to emigrate to Medina, until nearly all his followers left <b>Mecca.</b> Being alarmed at the departure, according to tradition, the Meccans plotted to assassinate Muhammad. With the help of Ali, Muhammad fooled the Meccans watching him, and secretly slipped away from the town with Abu Bakr. By 622, Muhammad emigrated to Medina, a large agricultural oasis. Those who migrated from <b>Mecca</b> along with Muhammad became known as muhajirun (emigrants).|$|E
5|$|On 12 Dhu al-Hijjah, {{the same}} process of stoning of the pillars as of 11 Dhu al-Hijjah takes place. Pilgrims may leave Mina for <b>Mecca</b> before sunset on the 12th.|$|E
5|$|The Qur'an is {{the first}} and most {{important}} source of Islamic law. Believed to be the direct word of God as revealed to Muhammad through angel Gabriel in <b>Mecca</b> and Medina, the scripture specifies the moral, philosophical, social, political and economic basis on which a society should be constructed. The verses revealed in <b>Mecca</b> deal with philosophical and theological issues, whereas those revealed in Medina are concerned with socio-economic laws. The Qur'an was written and preserved during the life of Muhammad, and compiled soon after his death.|$|E
5|$|Abu Bakr {{was born}} around 1321 to his sultan father an-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1310–1341) and his {{concubine}} mother, Narjis. Narjis also {{gave birth to}} Abu Bakr's younger full brothers Ramadan (died 1343) and Yusuf (died 1346). Information about Abu Bakr's early childhood is unavailable in the Mamluk sources. The first mention of Abu Bakr came in 1332. At that time, Abu Bakr {{had been sent to}} the desert fortress of al-Karak to join his half-brothers Ahmad and Ibrahim in their military training. Also during that year, Abu Bakr left al-Karak to accompany his father and half-brothers Anuk and Ahmad at al-Aqaba and from there to <b>Mecca</b> to perform the Hajj pilgrimage. However, an-Nasir Muhammad had them return to al-Karak before the trek to <b>Mecca.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the casting}} of stones, animals are {{slaughtered}} {{to commemorate the}} story of Abraham and Ishmael. Traditionally the pilgrims slaughtered the animal themselves, or oversaw the slaughtering. Today many pilgrims buy a sacrifice voucher in <b>Mecca</b> before the greater Hajj begins, which allows an animal to be slaughtered {{in the name of}} God (Allah) on the 10th, without the pilgrim being physically present. Modern abattoirs complete the processing of the meat, which is then sent as charity to poor people around the world. At {{the same time as the}} sacrifices occur at <b>Mecca,</b> Muslims worldwide perform similar sacrifices, in a three-day global festival called Eid al-Adha.|$|E
5|$|Although Muhammad had {{delivered}} Quranic verses commanding the Hajj, the Muslims had not performed it due to Quraysh enmity. In {{the month of}} Shawwal 628, Muhammad ordered his followers to obtain sacrificial animals and {{to prepare for a}} pilgrimage (umrah) to <b>Mecca,</b> saying that God had promised him the fulfillment of this goal in a vision when he was shaving his head after completion of the Hajj. Upon hearing of the approaching 1,400 Muslims, the Quraysh dispatched 200 cavalry to halt them. Muhammad evaded them by taking a more difficult route, enabling his followers to reach al-Hudaybiyya just outside <b>Mecca.</b> According to Watt, although Muhammad's decision to make the pilgrimage was based on his dream, he was also demonstrating to the pagan Meccans that Islam did not threaten the prestige of the sanctuaries, that Islam was an Arabian religion.|$|E
5|$|Another {{tradition}} {{says that}} the Black Stone was originally an angel that had been placed by God in the Garden of Eden to guard Adam. The angel was absent when Adam ate the forbidden fruit and was punished by being turned into a jewel — the Black Stone. God granted it the power of speech and placed it {{at the top of}} Abu Qubays, a mountain in the historic region of Khurasan, before moving the mountain to <b>Mecca.</b> When Ibrahim took the Black Stone from Abu Qubays to build the Kaaba, the mountain asked Ibrahim to intercede with God so {{that it would not be}} returned to Khurasan and would stay in <b>Mecca.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the House of Saud's nineteenth century (1806) control over <b>Mecca</b> and Medina, they demolished many of the religious buildings including tombs and mosques, whether inside or outside the Baqi, in accordance with their doctrine. These were razed to the ground, and plundered for their decorations and goods.|$|E
5|$|Economic reforms {{addressed}} {{the plight of}} the poor, which was becoming an issue in pre-Islamic <b>Mecca.</b> The Quran requires payment of an alms tax (zakat) {{for the benefit of the}} poor; as Muhammad's power grew he demanded that tribes who wished to ally with him implement the zakat in particular.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{before leaving}} <b>Mecca,</b> pilgrims perform a {{farewell}} tawaf called the Tawaf al-Wadaa. 'Wadaa' means 'to bid farewell'. The pilgrims circle the Kaaba seven times counter-clockwise, {{and if they}} can, attempt to touch or kiss the Kaaba.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{conquest of}} Jerusalem in 1187, the Ayyubids under Saladin {{may have been}} the first to {{establish}} the position of amir al-hajj (commander of the pilgrimage) to protect the annual Hajj caravans leaving Damascus for <b>Mecca</b> with the appointment of Tughtakin ibn Ayyub to the office.|$|E
5|$|From the 8th century AD onward, astronomers {{developed}} {{methods for}} approximating and calculating the direction to <b>Mecca</b> (qibla)—and its distance—from any {{location on the}} Earth. From the 9th century onward they were using spherical trigonometry and map projection methods to determine these quantities accurately. The calculation is essentially {{the conversion of the}} equatorial polar coordinates of <b>Mecca</b> (i.e. its longitude and latitude) to its polar coordinates (i.e. its qibla and distance) relative to a system whose reference meridian is the great circle through the given location and the Earth's poles, and whose polar axis is the line through the location and its antipodal point.|$|E
5|$|In {{the broader}} Arab world, the {{declaration}} {{was seen as}} a betrayal of the British wartime understandings with the Arabs. The Sharif of <b>Mecca</b> and other Arab leaders considered the declaration a violation of a previous commitment made in the McMahon–Hussein correspondence in exchange for launching the Arab Revolt.|$|E
5|$|Maldives' oldest mosque, it {{has been}} in {{continuous}} use since it was built. The mosque was reportedly built over an ancient temple which predated Islam; the original temple faced the setting sun, rather than <b>Mecca.</b>|$|E
5|$|Marching {{out from}} <b>Mecca</b> towards Medina on 10 December AD 624, the Meccans desired to avenge their losses at Badr and strike back at Muhammad and his followers. The Muslims readied for war soon {{afterwards}} {{and the two}} armies fought on the slopes and plains of Mount Uhud.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad gained few early {{followers}}, and met hostility {{from some}} Meccans. To escape persecution, Muhammad sent some followers to Abyssinia before {{he and his}} followers migrated from <b>Mecca</b> to Medina (then known as Yathrib) in the year 622. This event, the Hijra, {{marks the beginning of}} the Islamic calendar, also known as the Hijri Calendar. In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina. In December 629, after eight years of intermittent conflict with Meccan tribes, Muhammad gathered an army of 10,000 Muslim converts and marched on the city of <b>Mecca.</b> The attack went largely uncontested and Muhammad seized the city with little bloodshed. In 632, a few months after returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage, he fell ill and died. Before his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad {{was born}} in <b>Mecca</b> and lived there for roughly the first 52 {{years of his life}} (c. 570–622). This period is {{generally}} divided into two phases, before and after declaring his prophetic visions.|$|E
5|$|Sang Pencerah (The Enlightener) is a 2010 Indonesian film {{directed}} by Hanung Bramantyo and starring Lukman Sardi, Zaskia Adya <b>Mecca,</b> and Slamet Rahardjo. It is a biopic of Ahmad Dahlan which describes {{how he came}} to found the Islamic organisation Muhammadiyah.|$|E
5|$|The 1910 visitation is also {{recorded}} {{as being the}} travelling companion of the first known English Muslim to make the Haj pilgrimage to <b>Mecca.</b> However, his explanation of its scientific predictability did not meet with favour in the Holy City.|$|E
5|$|The Arabian Peninsula {{was largely}} arid and volcanic, making {{agriculture}} difficult except near oases or springs. The landscape was dotted with towns and cities; {{two of the}} most prominent being <b>Mecca</b> and Medina. Medina was a large flourishing agricultural settlement, while <b>Mecca</b> was an important financial center for many surrounding tribes. Communal life was essential for survival in the desert conditions, supporting indigenous tribes against the harsh environment and lifestyle. Tribal affiliation, whether based on kinship or alliances, was an important source of social cohesion. Indigenous Arabs were either nomadic or sedentary, the former constantly travelling {{from one place to another}} seeking water and pasture for their flocks, while the latter settled and focused on trade and agriculture. Nomadic survival also depended on raiding caravans or oases; nomads did not view this as a crime.|$|E
5|$|The Stone has {{suffered}} repeated desecrations and damage {{over the course}} of time. It {{is said to have been}} struck and smashed to pieces by a stone fired from a catapult during the Umayyad Caliphate's siege of <b>Mecca</b> in 683. The fragments were rejoined by Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr using a silver ligament. In January 930, it was stolen by the Qarmatians, who carried the Black Stone away to their base in Hajar (modern Eastern Arabia). According to Ottoman historian Qutb al-Din, writing in 1857, the Qarmatian leader Abu Tahir al-Jannabi set the Black Stone up in his own mosque, the Masjid al-Dirar, with the intention of redirecting the hajj away from <b>Mecca.</b> However, this failed, and pilgrims continued to venerate the spot where the Black Stone had been.|$|E
5|$|The {{spoils of}} battle, {{including}} the enslaved {{women and children}} of the tribe, were divided up among the Muslims that {{had participated in the}} siege and among the emigrees from <b>Mecca</b> (who had hitherto depended on the help of the Muslims native to Medina.|$|E
5|$|According to the Quran and Islamic traditions, al-Aqsa Mosque is {{the place}} from which Muhammad went on a night journey (al-isra) during which he rode on Buraq, who took him from <b>Mecca</b> to al-Aqsa. Muhammad {{tethered}} Buraq to the Western Wall and prayed at al-Aqsa Mosque and after he finished his prayers, the angel Jibril (Gabriel) traveled with him to heaven, where he met several other prophets and led them in prayer.|$|E
5|$|Although he was {{a proponent}} of secular politics, Nasser was an observant Muslim who made the Hajj pilgrimage to <b>Mecca</b> in 1954 and 1965. He {{was known to be}} {{personally}} incorruptible, a characteristic which further enhanced his reputation among the citizens of Egypt and the Arab world. Nasser's personal hobbies included playing chess, American films, reading Arabic, English, and French magazines, and listening to classical music.|$|E
