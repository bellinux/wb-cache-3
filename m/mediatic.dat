5000|$|This {{description}} of modern TV shows as [...] "visual novels" [...] and of The Familiar {{as an ongoing}} televisual series albeit {{in the shape of}} a book, resonates in the typographic world of the book.

The pervasive presence of television series as keystones of American mainstream culture, can also be felt in the numerous references to Battlestar Galactica as a common enjoyment of Anwar and his daughter Xanther, to be compared with the mentions and quotes from books and videogames, a modern <b>mediatic</b> panorama.|$|E

50|$|Returning to Armenia in 1991, Slak Kakosyan {{gathered}} a community, founded the Children of Ari, {{and began to}} hold rituals on traditional Armenian holy days.

During the 1990s the group reached <b>mediatic</b> visibility. According to ethnologist Yulia Antonyan, assistant professor of the Department of Cultural Studies at the Yerevan State University, the emergence of Hetanism is attributable to the same causes that led to the explosion of other Neopagan, but also Krishnaite and Protestant movements in the other post-Soviet countries: it is the indigenous and ethnic answer to the social and cultural upheavals that followed the collapse of the Soviet structure and its atheist and materialistic identity.|$|E
5000|$|In {{its first}} decades especially, the Collège {{developed}} a collective culture distinct {{from that of}} other secondary schools. It was a co-educational school from the beginning; {{male and female students}} were mixed together in a manner that was relatively rare in French schools, and especially in French boarding schools. The school was open in both a material and an educational sense: it had no walls or gates, and students were encouraged and expected to govern themselves to a significant extent. The school’s pacifist and activist origins, its summer work-camps, remote location, and somewhat spartan living conditions for boarding students, encouraged a situation in which teachers and students lived, ate, and worked together in the same modest setting, relatively isolated from the aggressively consumerist and <b>mediatic</b> culture of the early cold war.|$|E

50|$|In 1962, Brigitte Bardot, actress, began {{for what}} was her first battle for animal cause, militating for the painless {{slaughtering}} gun in slaughterhouses.

She was invited at the Élysée Palace and received a few years later the stunning to slaughtering by the French government. In 1977, Brigitte Bardot released a marge <b>mediatic</b> campaign going to the polar icefields in Blanc-Sablon, Canada, after the invitation of Paul Watson from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, to denounce the organized massacre of whitecoats for their fur. Her trip was five days long and under an incredible media pressure. Back to France, she accomplished the vote on banning the commerce of derived products from seal hunting of less than four weeks, with the support from the French president of that period, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.|$|E

50|$|The name of {{the show}} comes from an {{organization}} within the plot, where the botineras are women that use an agency to develop <b>mediatic</b> romances with football players. The agency is managed by Giselle López (Florencia Peña). The plot starts with the arrival to Buenos Aires of football player Cristian Flores (Nicolás Cabré), who is determined on getting married with his girlfriend, Marga Molinari (Isabel Macedo). Flores was suspected of murdering Cappa, a rival player in Europe, and the police start to investigate him. Laura Posse (Romina Gaetani) tries to investigate him by becoming a botinera, and therefore by getting near him. For this purpose, she takes a secret identity as Mía Alberdi. Flores was living with his agent, Tato Marín, so Mía managed to work as secretary for Tato. Tato had killed Alberto Flores (Cristian's father) {{in order to have}} control over him by acting as a parental figure. This was unknown by Flores, but not by Nino Paredes, Tato's lawyer. Paredes kept evidence of the crime to threaten him.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>Mediatic</b> Performance in 2010, Morales {{began to}} post flyers around Milan {{offering}} money to men {{if they would}} allow her to beat them. The flyer {{attracted the attention of}} an Italian journalist who contacted her for an interview, which was then manipulated and published in the Italian tabloid magazines Vero and Visto. The article then attracted the attention of the writers of Pomeriggio 5, a talk show broadcast by Silvio Berlusconi's TV company, whose official target consists of old people and housewives. I decided to perform the character presented in those magazines. The fact that I am an artist was never mentioned. Eventually that appearance on the TV talk show generated another [...] "media presence" [...] on the famous Italian TV show called Striscia la notizia, which is a parody of the week's news {{and was one of the}} first examples of [...] "Italian entertainment TV" [...] brought to Italy by Berlusconi in the 1980s. In Striscia la Notizia I was ranked [...] "Monster Number 2" [...] in a top ten of media freaks, leading me to title the work [...] "Monster N° 2 Patrimony".|$|E
5000|$|When it came {{to select}} {{the leader of the}} PS list for the 2015 {{regional}} election, Pierre de Saintignon was chosen. This was described as a gambit: a good knowledge of the place versus leaving the shadow and leading the battle under his own name. In any case, the odds were not good due to the low popularity of both the French President François Hollande and the government's policy. When the name of Pierre de Saintignon was published, the opinion polls gave the PS below 20% for the first round (unless a fusion with other lists occurs before the ballot). In any case, second round PS coalition is forecast as the last of the three lists that are expected to remain in competition. This results into predicting a meltdown of the 2010's 51.90% to only 2015's 32% or less. But, due to the electoral law, the final result is far worse: the 73 elected seats of 2010 for Nord + Pas-de-Calais are expected to melt into only (120*.75)*32%=29 seats! Aggravating the general tendency is the fact that, in the North-Pas-de-Calais-Picardy region, the two other 'second round' lists are conducted by the top <b>mediatic</b> leaders of their respective parties, while their challenger is sometimes described as the [...] "Inconnu du Nord".|$|E
