The books were selected for the Quality Paperback Book Club in 1995. Bannon also provided the foreword for Strange Sisters: The Art of Lesbian Pulp Fiction 1949–1969 in 1999, discussing her reaction to the artwork on her own books and the other lesbian pulp fiction books she bought and read. Five of The Beebo Brinker Chronicles were reissued by Cleis Press again between 2001 and 2003—excluding The Marriage—with autobiographical forewords that described Bannon's experiences of writing the books and her reaction to their popularity, causing another wave of interest.|$|E

40|$|Osteo{{arthritis}} (OA) is {{the most}} common form of arthritis worldwide and is characterised by the progressive degradation of articular cartilage. Ageing is the primary risk factor associated with OA. However, the roles of ageing-related mechanisms in cartilage homeostasis are poorly understood. The class three histone deacetylase, Silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog (SIRT 1) has been extensively shown to regulate lifespan in lower organisms and signalling pathways linked to mammalian ageing. My thesis explores the role of Sirtuin 1 in cartilage homeostasis and OA. I used in vitro experiments with chondrocyte cell lines, human clinical samples, novel genetically modified cartilage specific and <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> SIRT 1 deficient mice alongside molecular biological tools to investigate my research questions. Human OA cartilage showed decreased SIRT 1 compared to healthy cartilage. Mice with cartilage-specific SIRT 1 deletion showed greater cartilage degradation during ageing and in an experimental OA model. In vitro and in vivo studies showed SIRT 1 to directly regulate autophagy in chondrocytes. More importantly, the activation of autophagy using spermidine protected against experimental OA in wild-type mice but not in cartilage-specific SIRT 1 deficient mice. In addition, <b>my</b> data revealed <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> SIRT 1 deficient mice had increased early joint inflammation in repose to injury but displayed less cartilage loss over time in an experimental OA model. Together I have shown that SIRT 1 declines with age and contributes to OA due to dysregulated autophagy. However, chronic low grade inflammation caused by SIRT 1 loss was protective. My data suggest these pathways can be targeted to treat OA. </p...|$|R

We studied the relationship between VO 2 and DO 2 of kidney and <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> during graded progressive exsanguination. The relationship between <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> VO 2 and DO 2 was biphasic, and <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> VO 2 decreased by 5. 6 +/- 14. 4 % (P = NS) from the initial value to the value nearest <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> DO 2 c. Kidney DO 2 decreased {{in direct proportion to}} <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> DO 2 such that the average R 2 value describing the linear regression of kidney DO 2 vs. <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> DO 2 was 0. 94 +/- 0. 02. The relationship between kidney, like <b>whole</b> <b>body,</b> VO 2 and DO 2 appeared biphasic; however, kidney VO 2 decreased by 63. 3 +/- 10. 4 % (P less than 0. 0001) from the initial value to the value nearest kidney DO 2 c. Renal O 2 extraction ratio was relatively constant over a wide range of kidney DO 2, whereas <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> O 2 extraction ratio increased progressively at all <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> DO 2 values as <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> DO 2 decreased. However, final values of O 2 extraction ratio were indistinguishable for <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> (0. 86 +/- 0. 1) and kidney (0. 86 +/- 0. 06) (P = NS).

All rats except those of control group were housed in a heated container and maintained at 36 °C for 3 hours until the rectal temperature reached 41 - 42 °C.

Segmental BIA indices showed a significant association with <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> composition measures assessed by total body water (TBW) using the isotope dilution method (D 2 O). Impedance index was better related to TBW and fat free mass (FFM), while specific resistivity was better related to the fat mass of the body.
