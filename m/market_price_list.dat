40|$|In {{a highly}} {{competitive}} environment a product’s commercial success depends increasingly more upon the ability to satisfy consumers’ preferences that are highly diversified. Since a consumer product typically comprises a host of technological attributes, its market value incorporates all of the individual values of technological attributes. If the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for individual technological characteristics of a product is known, one can conjecture the overall WTP or the imputed <b>market</b> <b>price</b> for the product. The <b>market</b> <b>price</b> <b>listed</b> by the producer has to be equal to or lower than this WTP for the commercial survival of the product. In this {{paper we propose a}} methodology for estimating the value of individual product characteristics and thus the overall WTP of the product with DEA. Our methodology is based on a model derived from the consumer demand theory on the one hand, and the recent theoretical developments on the flexible DEA frontiers on the other hand. The paper also presents a real case study for the mobile phone market, which is characterized by its high speed of innovation. The suggested model and its empirical applications has implications for the extension of DEA methodology to the estimation of market value of a complex multi-attribute product and/or of a value of quality attribute that is not explicitly marketable in isolation. We also expect that the framework will shed some light on the successful way of product differentiation when the cost information for individual characteristics is available. ...|$|R

With Multiple Listing Service data from a large metropolitan area, we create two price indexes, using first <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> and then selling price {{as the dependent variable}} in the hedonic regressions. The market is then geographically and categorically segmented, and Granger causality tests are performed to analyze the leading aspect of <b>list</b> <b>prices</b> in the <b>list</b> price-sales <b>price</b> relationship. We find that different segments of the market perform quite differently over the time period of our study, suggesting that for data-based appraisal purposes care is needed in determining the manner and level of aggregation.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} different mathematical approaches to buck-to-order log merchandizing. A new bucking-to-order planning model using mixed integer programming was developed to determine the optimal production from a stand given different market constraints and forest inventory data. Three different approaches: <b>market</b> <b>prices,</b> target cutting patterns and adjusted <b>price</b> <b>list</b> were tested for generating cutting instructions to fulfill the plan created by the new planning model. The three approaches were evaluated in four test stands. The <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> approach simply applied the <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> to each stand. The target cutting patterns approach applied the sample cutting patterns generated from the planning model to the stand. The adjusted <b>price</b> <b>list</b> used a dynamic programming algorithm embedded in a search heuristic to adjust both the prices and small end diameters of log products to achieve the production goals of the planning models. The results showed that developing a buck-to-order plan is important in obtaining good order fulfillment. The target cutting patterns and adjusted <b>price</b> <b>list</b> approaches certainly out performed the <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> approach. This paper shows that these two approaches are capable of achieving excellent order fulfillment. Further development and testing is needed to determine which method is the best at generating cutting instructions for buck-to-order merchandizing...|$|R

Although we limit ourselves to the housing market, the findings might be relevant for other sectors {{of the real estate}} market or any other market that is characterized by illiquidity, indivisibility of goods and a high level of heterogeneity between goods. Chapter two tests whether the empirical predictions from housing market models with asymmetric information are true. Specifically, we test whether the probability that a house will sell will decline with the time the house has already spent on the market, and the probability that a house will be withdrawn from the market will increase with the time the house has already spent on the market. Chapter three considers the role of the <b>list</b> <b>price</b> in the housing <b>market.</b> <b>List</b> <b>prices</b> would have no role in a housing market with symmetric information between sellers and buyers and the probability of a sale would not be affected by reductions in the <b>list</b> <b>price.</b> Based on this observation we test for the presence of asymmetric information between sellers and buyers in the housing market by testing whether reductions in the <b>list</b> <b>price</b> affect the probability of a sale. Chapter four investigates the well know price-volume correlation in the housing market. We estimate a Vector Error Correction Model on a rich set of variables. We compare our empirical results against the empirical predictions from a number of housing market theories.

The data base was merchandised using a simulation program. The result after merchandise was compared with the result from actual harvest operations using the same <b>price</b> <b>list.</b> The database was manipulated further until the results were consistent with results from the harvesting on Gotland. It proved to be difficult to create a data base that resembles the pine forest on Gotland. A large amount of forced bucking (without computer assisted bucking) was found in the material. The result from the harvested timber from Gotland gave no longer a desirable outcome. The large amount of forced bucking is probably due to the very crooked forest that grows on Gotland in combination with the steering <b>price</b> <b>lists</b> used. To avoid reversing the harvester head before each log was bucked, the harvest operators instead chose to buck manually. Adjusting the steering <b>price</b> <b>list</b> should reduce the amount of forced bucking.
