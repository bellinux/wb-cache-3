5|$|In Essai, Cantillon {{provided}} an advanced version of John Locke's quantity theory of <b>money,</b> focusing on relative inflation and {{the velocity of}} <b>money.</b> Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually and that the new supply of <b>money</b> has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral <b>money.</b> Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new <b>money</b> enjoy higher standards of living {{at the expense of}} later recipients. The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy, is now known as the Cantillon effect. Cantillon also considered changes in the velocity of <b>money</b> (quantity of exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in the quantity of <b>money.</b> While he believed that the <b>money</b> supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in <b>money</b> substitutes—or bank notes—could affect prices by effectively increasing the velocity of circulating of deposited specie. Apart from distinguishing <b>money</b> from <b>money</b> substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond the quantity of specie—or fiduciary media—suggesting that the volume of fiduciary media is strictly limited by people's confidence in its redeemability. He considered fiduciary media a useful tool to abate the downward pressure that hoarding of specie has on the velocity of <b>money.</b>|$|E

5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon {{occurred during}} the war in that the Confederate government issued both regular <b>money</b> notes and interest-bearing <b>money,</b> although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes during the war that were legal tender for most financial transactions. The circulation of the interest-bearing <b>money</b> and the convertibility of one kind of <b>money</b> into the other was enforced by fiat and Southern banks were threatened with a return to the gold standard if they did not cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the gold standard, although actual convertibility was not to come into effect until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E

Because of this, the Nasty Boys split with Hart and attacked <b>Money</b> Inc. before the match. Later on, the Headshrinkers interfered on behalf of <b>Money</b> Inc. and helped DiBiase make Earthquake submit to the Million Dollar Dream, thereby winning <b>Money</b> Inc. the Championship. After the match, the Nasty Boys again attacked Jimmy Hart. At the 1992 Survivor Series on November 25, <b>Money</b> Inc. and the Beverly Brothers faced the Nasty Boys and the Natural Disasters in an 8-man elimination tag team match.

5|$|Belief that Cooper did {{not survive}} was bolstered {{by the fact that}} none of the <b>money</b> has ever been used. A {{quantity}} was found under riverbank silt, but its location is not consistent with Cooper dying or losing the ransom in the jump. This, combined with the knowledge that with law enforcement involved, a ransom would in effect be 100% bait <b>money</b> (a fact known to the public since the trial following the Lindbergh kidnapping) makes it less likely that Cooper had any intention of actually using the ransom <b>money.</b> A minority opinion is that a North American of Cooper's apparent sophistication could hardly have expected to spend or fence currency as hot as the ransom would predictably be, and he had carried out a planned dumping of the <b>money</b> before disappearing.|$|E
