40|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} World War II, state authorities attempted to take over parish archives which were stored in parish offices. In 1 946, County Registration Offices (Gminne Urzedy Stanu Cywilnego) were told to make copies of the parish archives. They were unable to complete this task {{due to a lack}} of qualified workers as well as the enormous cost of this undertaking and the resistance on the part of the clergy. Despite pressure from the Administration Office and the <b>mayor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bialystok,</b> not all copies of parish archives were made by the end of 1949. The authorities decided to confiscate the parish archives and transfer them to State Registration Offices. This was achieved with the help of security forces in the latter part of 1949 and the beginning of 1950. The lack of cooperation on the side of the clergy resulted in financial and administrative sanctions. The archives remain in State Registration Offices till the present day.
