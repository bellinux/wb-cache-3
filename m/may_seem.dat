5|$|Tornadoes <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> rare in {{downtown}} areas because downtown areas cover {{such a small}} geographical area. Considering {{the size of a}} central business district is very small compared to the city limits, tornadoes will strike outside of the downtown area more often.|$|E
5|$|All that {{is known}} of the {{appearance}} of the castle is from contemporary drawings. Although these <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> fanciful to modern eyes, there are better preserved sites which share some features. Tutbury and Pontefract Castles both have similar gatehouses and chapels, and Tutbury's motte and Pontefract's curtain wall are also close in style to those in the illustrations. Sandal Castle has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and this feature is confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which still remain.|$|E
5|$|Fellow street artist Shepard Fairey {{wrote in}} Swindle:Invader's pop art <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> shallow, but {{by taking the}} risk of {{illegally}} re-contextualizing video game characters in an urban environment that provides more chaotic social interaction than a gamer's bedroom, he makes a statement about the desensitizing nature of video games and consumer culture. In a postmodern paradox, a game like Grand Theft Auto takes {{the danger of the}} streets and puts it in a safe video game, while Invader takes a safe video game icon and inserts it into the danger of the streets.|$|E

5|$|From {{this model}} of Kantian ethics, O'Neill begins to develop a theory of justice. She argues that the {{rejection}} of certain principles, such as deception and coercion, provides {{a starting point for}} basic conceptions of justice, which she argues are more determinate for human beings that the more abstract principles of equality or liberty. Nevertheless, she concedes that these principles <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> to be excessively demanding: there are many actions and institutions that do rely on non-universalisable principles, such as injury.|$|E
5|$|MRO's main {{computer}} is a 133MHz, 10.4million transistor, 32-bit, RAD750 processor. This processor is a radiation-hardened {{version of a}} PowerPC 750 or G3 processor with a specially built motherboard. The RAD750 is a successor to the RAD6000. This processor <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> underpowered in comparison to a modern PC processor, but it is extremely reliable, resilient, and can function in solar flare-ravaged deep space. The operating system software is VxWorks and has extensive fault protection protocols and monitoring.|$|E
5|$|On the {{one hand}} there are very many people who, if they read any poetry at all, try to take all its {{statements}} seriously – and find them silly... This <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> an absurd mistake but, alas! it is none the less common. On the other hand {{there are those who}} succeed too well, who swallow 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty...,' as the quintessence of an aesthetic philosophy, not as the expression of a certain blend of feelings, and proceed into a complete stalemate of muddle-mindedness {{as a result of their}} linguistic naivety.|$|E

5|$|Since {{dance is}} already an art form, “weapon dance as art” <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> redundant; yet, “art” is used here {{to mean the}} re-creation, say, of a folk weapon dance in a more {{professional}} staged venue, such as a ballet, or when an Australian, Native American, or African troupe of professional musicians and dancers present a reenactment on stage of a weapon dance, or when the use of weapons is introduced in stylized dance enactments of fighting. For example, recent ballets such as the New York City Ballet’s version of Romeo and Juliet (to the music of Sergei Prokofiev) employ highly choreographed sword-fight/dance sequences.|$|E
5|$|Tchaikovsky's {{analysis}} {{of each of}} The Five was unsparing. While {{at least some of}} his observations <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> distorted and prejudiced, he also mentions some details which ring clear and true. His diagnosis of Rimsky-Korsakov's creative crisis is very accurate. He also calls Mussorgsky the most gifted musically of the Five, though Tchaikovsky could not appreciate the forms Mussorgsky's originality took. Nonetheless, he badly underestimates Borodin's technique and gives Balakirev far less than his full due—all the more telling in light of Balakirev's help in conceiving and shaping Romeo and Juliet.|$|E
5|$|The 30-word {{design was}} the most popular {{recruitment}} poster at the time having been printed ten times the volume of Leete's image. Leete's image has been praised for being more arresting while his accompanying text is also far less verbose. The official wording, taken from a Kitchener speech, <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> more fitting for a character in a Henry James novel. The 30-word recruiting poster was developed as Britons' collective hopes of the war being over by Christmas were dashed in January 1915 and volunteer enlistments fell.|$|E

5|$|The modern Saluki has {{retained}} qualities of hunting hounds and <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> reserved to strangers. The often independent and aloof breed {{may be difficult}} to train. Training methods should always be gentle and patient. Salukis may bore easily and are not an ideal breed to leave unattended for long periods. The Saluki does not typically enjoy rough games or activities such as retrieving balls. Early socialization will help prevent timidity and shyness in later life. Given its hunting instincts, the dog is prone to chasing moving objects.|$|E
5|$|There are {{potential}} problems when the MSE is applied in a cross-cultural context, when the clinician and patient are from different cultural backgrounds. For example, the patient's culture might have different norms for appearance, behavior and display of emotions. Culturally normative spiritual and religious beliefs {{need to be}} distinguished from delusions and hallucinations - these <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> similar to one who does not understand that they have different roots. Cognitive assessment must also take the patient's language and educational background into account. Clinician's racial bias is another potential confounder.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} breed traits which may cause concern as health issues. They include skull {{issues such as}} an open fontanelle, where in young dogs there is a soft spot in the skull; it is common in dogs under a year old. A {{complication}} from that condition is hydrocephalus, also known as water on the brain. This condition may cause neurological symptoms that require the dog to be euthanised. Fused toes, where {{two or more of}} the dog's toes are fused together, <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> to be a health issue but this breed trait is not a cause for concern.|$|E

5|$|There are {{situations}} in which it <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> that matter, energy, or information travels at speeds greater thanc, but they do not. For example, as is discussed in the propagation of light in a medium section below, many wave velocities can exceed c. For example, the phase velocity of X-rays through most glasses can routinely exceed c, but phase velocity does not determine the velocity at which waves convey information.|$|E
5|$|Yeats is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} twentieth century key English language poets. He was a Symbolist poet, using allusive imagery and symbolic structures throughout his career. He chose words and assembled them so that, in addition to a particular meaning, they suggest abstract thoughts that <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> more significant and resonant. His use of symbols is usually something physical that is both itself and a suggestion of other, perhaps immaterial, timeless qualities.|$|E
5|$|Although such a {{long-range}} {{attack on a}} state far from {{the centre of the}} Empire <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> extraordinary (the last time the Empire had attempted anything on this scale was the failed invasion of Sicily over one hundred and twenty years earlier), it can be explained in terms of Manuel's foreign policy, which was to use the Latins to ensure the survival of the Empire. This focus on the bigger picture of the eastern Mediterranean and even further afield thus led Manuel to intervene in Egypt: it was believed that {{in the context of the}} wider struggle between the crusader states and the Islamic powers of the east, control of Egypt would be the deciding factor. It had become clear that the ailing Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt held the key to the fate of the crusader states. If Egypt came out of its isolation and joined forces with the Muslims under Nur ad-Din, the crusader cause was in trouble.|$|E

5|$|As a term, neo {{soul was}} coined by Kedar Massenburg of Motown Records {{in the late}} 1990s as a {{marketing}} category following the commercial breakthroughs of artists such as D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. The success of D'Angelo's 1995 debut album Brown Sugar has been regarded by several writers and music critics as inspiration behind the term's origin. While some artists have ignored the label, others have received the designation with controversy because it <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> contrived to music audiences and imply that soul music had ended {{at some point in}} time. In a 2002 interview for Billboard, Massenburg said that genre classifications are often unpopular because they may be suggestive of a short-lived trend. However, although he said neo soul is still essentially soul music, Massenburg felt there was a need to market artists of the genre for listeners to have an understanding of what they were buying.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{additional}} expense involved in re-shooting many {{portions of the}} film, Himanshu Rai replaced Najm-ul-Hassan with Ashok Kumar, who was the brother of Sashadhar Mukherjee's wife, as the hero of Jeevan Naiya. This marked the debut, improbable as it <b>may</b> <b>seem,</b> of Ashok Kumar's five-decade-long career in Hindi films. Najm-ul-Hassan was dismissed from his job at Bombay Talkies (this was {{the period in which}} actors and actresses were paid regular monthly salaries by one specific film studio and could not work in any other studio). His reputation as a dangerous cad established, he could not find work in any other studio. His career was ruined and he sank into obscurity.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the thought}} that {{increasing}} availability to emergency medicine will improve patient outcomes, little empirical evidence exists to directly support that claim, even in developed countries. Between 1985 and 1998 only 54 randomized controlled trials related to emergency medical services were published, implying {{that much of the}} current standard of care rests upon meager support. A similar lack of direct proof exists for the effectiveness of international assistance in promoting emergency medicine in other countries. Although it <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> that such efforts must improve health, the failure to quantify international emergency medicine's impact renders it more difficult to identify the best practices and target areas in which the most benefit may be achieved.|$|E

The performance scripts mainly originate from a series of real interviews with a diverse group of artist teachers, who emphasise the collaborative, performative and subversive nature of teaching. These views <b>may</b> <b>seems</b> symptomatic for contemporary art practices, but are ultimately antagonistic to the ongoing commodification of the system of art education...|$|R
