5|$|The reader {{progressively}} learns their history. Dobroselova originally {{lived in}} the country, but moved to St. Petersburg (which she hates) when her father lost his job. Her father becomes very violent and her mother severely depressed. Her father dies and they move in with Anna Fyodorovna, a landlady who was previously cruel to them but at least pretends to feel sympathy for their situation. Dobroselova is tutored by a poor student named Pokrovsky, whose drunken father occasionally visits. She eventually {{falls in love with}} Pokrovsky. She struggles to save a <b>measly</b> amount of money to purchase the complete works of Pushkin at the market for his birthday present, then allows his father to give the books to him instead, claiming that just knowing he received the books will be enough for her happiness. Pokrovsky falls ill soon after, and his dying wish is to see the sun and the world outside. Dobroselova obliges by opening the blinds to reveal grey clouds and dirty rain. In response Pokrovsky only shakes his head and then passes away. Dobroselova's mother dies shortly afterwards, and Dobroselova is left in the care of Anna for a time, but the abuse becomes too much and she goes to live with Fedora across the street.|$|E
25|$|Falcons quarterback Michael Vick {{entered the}} game with {{considerable}} pregame hype and an 8-game unbeaten streak. Vick, however, was sacked twice by Tampa Bay, and held to only 125 yards passing and a <b>measly</b> 15 yards rushing. Meanwhile, Brad Johnson connected on four touchdowns (two apiece to Jurevicius and McCardell) as the Buccaneers won 34–10.|$|E
25|$|The action {{shifted to}} Grand Rapids home {{ballpark}} for Game 2, and Earlene Risinger silenced the Peaches' bats to just two <b>measly</b> hits {{en route to}} a complete game, 2–0 shutout. Her clutch performance was backed by timely hitting by Ziegler, who hit a RBI single in the seventh inning to give her a 1–0 lead, and Dolores Moore, who drove in the game's final run with a sacrifice fly in the eight.|$|E
25|$|Just {{like last}} year, Islamabad again faced Karachi in the eliminator. In what {{proved to be}} a thrilling game, Karachi, batting first, scored a <b>measly</b> 126 getting all out in the process. Islamabad was set to win and qualify for the second play off. However, {{that was not the case}} as the second innings proved. The Karachi bowlers outshone the Islamabad bowlers with Muhammad Amir, Imad Wasim and Usama Mir each picking up three wickets. Islamabad were all out for a mere 82 runs, their lowest in the tournament and the second-lowest in the tournament's history.Hence, the {{defending}} champions were knocked out.|$|E

25|$|After Africa XI {{had been}} bowled {{out for a}} <b>measly</b> 106, rain poured down {{steadily}} on Kingsmead, and the umpires eventually declared that play was not possible. The rain had already caused {{the start of the}} game to be delayed for two hours, before Shoaib Akhtar and Zaheer Khan unleashed their fast bowling on the African side. When Tatenda Taibu departed for 10, the score was 51 for 7, and only good hitting and running from Shaun Pollock, who hit 44 not out, carried Africa past 100. Steve Tikolo, the top-scorer from the last match, was intriguingly dropped. Then, Dale Steyn and Shaun Pollock ripped out the two Asian openers Virender Sehwag and Shahid Afridi, and, with the score eight for 2, the weather intervened. No further play was possible, and thus the two continents shared the title.|$|E
25|$|Outstanding {{figures of}} 10-6-10-4 from Bermuda's T Burgess kept Israel's total {{down to a}} <b>measly</b> 86, and Winston Reid plundered 63 not out as the Bermudians raced to their target in under 14 overs {{for the loss of}} just one wicket. Paul Prashad hit an unbeaten 164 for Canada {{as they made their way}} to 356/6, ably {{supported}} by D Singh (65). Papua New Guinea showed fight in their response, Karo Ao (67) and Taunao Vai (51) compiling an opening stand of 126, but then F Waithe (4-37) reduced them to 133/4 and there was no way back; Derick Etwaroo took 4-64 and PNG ended on 267/9. Future Woking F.C. FA Cup hero Tim Buzaglo made 88 for Gibraltar as they reached 185/8, but 55 from E Vakausausa made sure of victory for Fiji (187/4). And Bakker took 5-20 as the USA slid to 88 all out and a ten-wicket loss to the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|On December 9, 2016, in a {{game against}} the Sacramento Kings, Anthony became the fifth (5th) active player to eclipse the 23,000 point mark joining Dirk Nowitzki, James, Paul Pierce and Vince Carter in the prestigious club. He also became the 29th player in NBA history to hit the scoring milestone. On December 25, 2016, in a Christmas Day game against the Boston Celtics, Anthony moved past Elgin Baylor into 28th place on the NBA career scoring list when he scored 29 points upping his total to 23,156 {{compared}} to Baylor's 23,149. On December 30, 2016, Anthony scored 26 points against the New Orleans Pelicans in a 92-104 loss upping his total to 23,192 points moving past Adrian Dantley into 27th place in the NBA career scoring list.

25|$|Early in {{the first}} quarter, Vikings punter Mitch Berger shanked a 12-yard punt that gave the 49ers a first down on the Minnesota 26-yard line, leading to fullback William Floyd's 1-yard {{touchdown}} run. It {{the start of a}} long day for Berger, who finished the game with a <b>measly</b> 29.9 yards per punt average on his seven kicks. Still, the Vikings responded on their first play after the ensuing kickoff with Cunningham's 66-yard touchdown pass to Carter. Late in the second quarter, a 28-yard pass interference penalty on Vikings safety Torrian Gray and a personal foul call against linebacker Dwayne Rudd for kicking the penalty flag gave the 49ers a first down on the Minnesota 2-yard line. On the next play, a penalty against linebacker Dixon Edwards put the ball on the 1, and Kirby ran the ball into the end zone from there, giving the 49ers a 14-7 lead {{at the end of a}} 61-yard drive. Then on the Vikings ensuing drive, linebacker Ken Norton Jr. intercepted a pass from Cunningham and returned it 23 yards for a touchdown, making the score 21-7 going into halftime.|$|E
25|$|This {{game was}} part of a double header at the Garda RFC Westmanstown. The Vikings {{entering}} the game as huge underdogs {{for the first time in}} many years. Making matters worse the Vikings lost starting QB Marc Ashworth and Starting RB Ryan Meches to unforeseen circumstances leaving them with a 22-man squad facing the Champions. The game started positively for the Vikings on offence gathering some first downs and field position. The Defence which was the story of the day matched the champions in every aspect and looked a better outfit than the one that lost to Belfast in the Shamrock bowl the year before. As the first half came to a close the score was a <b>measly</b> 0–0 with both teams showing why they have been dominant in Irish football in recent years. The Vikings cam out in the second half hoping to get some movement on offence with their Defence continuing to be Dominant and impressive. The Vikings turned to players like ever present Kieran Coen to play both sides of the ball and he was the best player on the field on the day. With many other players such as Ian Cahill, Craig Switzer, Michael Guinane, Kieran Coen, Adrian Garvey and Sean Goldrick playing Offence, Defence and Special teams the game started to wear on the Vikings. 0-0 entering the 4th quarter in unprecedented 28 degree heat there was an air of inevitability about the game with the Vikings continually running 3 and outs on offence something had to give. With less than 10 minutes left and the Trojans creeping into Viking territory there was a sense that a big play needed to be made on Defence if they were going to have a shot of knocking off the Trojans. That chance came with a well read pass from the Trojans QB by Craig Switzer. The ball in his hands with 60 yards of clear field in front of the speedster nickel star of the Vikings and he took his eye off the ball and it fell on the turf. The crowd, the team and everyone else knew that was the chance and sure enough 3 plays later the Trojans constant Barrage finally broke the Vikings Defensive wall and ran in for a 20-yard score with 7 minutes left. The Trojans stopped the Vikings offense after some gutsy first downs by QB Paul Keane, RB/DL Ian Cahill and WR Sean Goldrick. The Trojans played the clock down to minutes left and with the game getting away from them the Vikings Defence gave up another score leaving it 14–0 final score.|$|E
500|$|On Empire magazine's {{list of the}} 500 {{greatest}} films, Saw ranked 499th. Bloody Disgusting {{ranked the}} film tenth in its list of the Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade, with the article calling Saw [...] "perhaps the most influential horror film of the decade, which kick-started a franchise.... In light of its <b>measly</b> $1.2 million price tag the film's quality relative to bigger-budget horror films is striking. It also takes itself seriously, which came as {{a breath of fresh}} air following the trend of wimpy tongue-in-cheek horror that had dominated the multiplexes post-Scream. More than anything, this twisted morality tale is a film made by horror fans, for horror fans; it's gory, it's depraved, and best of all it introduced a new horror icon in Jigsaw." [...] The Daily Telegraph listed the film number 14 on their Top 100 list that defined the 2000s.|$|E
500|$|The {{divisions}} {{by historical}} era or civilisation {{in the book}} series are carried over in the TV show, focusing on events in or directly affecting Great Britain and (to a lesser extent) the larger Western world. The Inca and Aztec empires are also featured in later series. Sketches are grouped under these divisions, named as in the books, beginning with the Savage Stone Age and including among others the Cut-throat Celts, Awful Egyptians, Groovy Greeks, Rotten Romans, Vicious Vikings, <b>Measly</b> Middle Ages, Terrible Tudors, Slimy Stuarts, Gorgeous Georgians and Vile Victorians. The timeline {{for the most part}} ended at the Woeful Second World War. During the fifth and final series the show featured a handful of significant post-World War II (or [...] "Troublesome Twentieth Century") events, including {{the civil rights movement and}} the Space Race between the US and the USSR. The most recent event referenced was the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the poor}} {{conditions}} of {{the police and the}} faulty hierarchic and bureaucratic system in the police force, he sank with his ship. But was he acknowledged by the state as a hero? Certainly not. Prime Minister’s adviser on Interior Senator Rehman Malik had announced Rs150,000 for his family – which is a <b>measly</b> amount for someone’s life – for someone who sacrificed his life for others and is nothing less than a national hero Sadly the state too has not shown its appreciation of such a man who saved the lives of so many especially in a time when they are most ill-equipped and the prime targets Its individuals like Faisal Khan who make the difference but get little acknowledgement. When will the government realise that their faces are saved from public humiliation because of the sacrifice of many Faisal Khans ...|$|E
2500|$|The Giants {{finished}} a dismal last in both 1995 & 1996, crippled by key injuries and slumps. 1995 {{had a strange}} feeling about it, with fans unsure if they would come back after the strike-shortened 1994 season (something that would keep attendances notably lower {{for a few more}} years, probably until the McGwire-Sosa record-breaking HR chase of 1998). Bonds continued as the Giants' driving force, posting fantastic numbers, with the highest WAR among position players in the National League (33 HR, 104 RBI, 109 R and 120 BB in 144 games). Matt Williams and Glenallen Hill (affectionately called [...] "G. Hill" [...] by manager Baker) were the only other Giants with 20+ HR, {{and the rest of the}} team had mediocre offensive numbers. The pitching staff was poor, with Mark Leiter leading the way with ten <b>measly</b> wins (10–12, 3.82 ERA). Closer Rod Beck had 33 saves but nine blown saves and a 4.45 ERA.|$|E
2500|$|After huge {{losses in}} the team roster and point guard shortage, Lithuania started the tournament with a loss to Turkey (76–84). This {{was the first time}} in the 21st century that the Lithuanians began a {{championship}} with a defeat. Later Lithuanians disappointingly lost to Poland, and depended on a strong fourth quarter [...] to beat Bulgaria. Finishing third in its group, Lithuania qualified for the second round. However, it already begun badly with a 23-point loss to Slovenia. Following this shocking loss, team's captain Robertas Javtokas, when asked about the team's future, said: [...] "I don't know what else we could promise. We must get straight or it is enough of promises. We must come as men with balls and not like kids. Otherwise, other teams will humiliate us again". The team's game still not improved, with a defeat to Spain (70–84) diminishing the Lithuanians' chances to qualify for the quarter-finals, and a loss to Serbia eliminating the team outright, with the final standing being a <b>measly</b> 12th place. Coach Ramūnas Butautas took all responsibility for the fiasco and resigned. It is regarded as the worst Lithuania national team performance ever.|$|E
2500|$|An {{air raid}} offense (predominantly passing-oriented with quarterback in shotgun {{formation}} usually with four wide receivers) coordinated by Leach, Washington State was projected {{to have one}} of its biggest advantages in the passing game, where junior quarterback Connor Halliday recorded 4187 passing yards, which was fourth in the country, on 656 passing attempts, which led the country by more than 50, for 28 touchdowns and 21 interceptions, the latter of which was most in the country. He spread the ball around to many different receivers; eight different receivers had more than 30 catches. The Cougars' leading receiver was sophomore Gabe Marks, who caught 69 passes for 770 yards and 6 touchdowns. Fellow sophomore Dom Williams caught 39 passes for 644 yards and a team-leading 7 touchdowns, [...] senior Vince Mayle caught 40 passes for 501 yards and 6 touchdowns, and freshman River Cracaft, an honorable mention all-conference honoree, caught 37 passes for 489 yards and 2 touchdowns. There were no tight ends on the roster. Washington State's offensive line was expected to be able to protect Halliday relatively easily, as Colorado State would have to drop a significant portion of its defense in to coverage, thus limiting its ability to blitz. Senior center Elliot Bosch, who was an honorable mention all-conference performer, anchored the offensive line, and was supported by fellow former walk-ons Gunnar Eklund, a sophomore left tackle, and Joe Dahl, a sophomore left guard. Leach commented on the group of walk-ons, specifically Bosch, noting, [...] "He’s developed his skills, worked really hard in the weight room and has been a big cornerstone for us. We wouldn’t be in a bowl game without him." [...] The Cougars' <b>measly</b> rushing attack, which averaged only 58.7 yards per game (123 out of 123 in the FBS), included junior Marcus Mason and sophomore Teondray Caldwell. Senior Andrew Furney, an honorable mention all-conference performer, handled the kicking duties, and made 15 of his 19 field goal tries with a long of 52 yards and 43 of his 44 extra point tries.|$|E
