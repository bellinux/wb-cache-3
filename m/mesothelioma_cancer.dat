We have extended those previous findings in the current study, which involves the pre-clinical development of an optimized version of FP-surv designed for human immunization (HIvax). Survivin-derived peptides for the most common haplotypes in the human population were identified and their immunogenicity confirmed in co-culture experiments using dendritic cells and T cells isolated from healthy donors. Peptides confirmed to induce CD 8 (+) and CD 4 (+) T cells activation in humans were then included in 2 transgenes optimized for presentation of processed peptides on MHC-I (HIvax 1) and MHC-II (HIvax 2). Fowlpox vectors expressing the HIvax transgenes were then generated and their efficacy was evaluated with subsequent co-culture experiments to measure interferon-γ and granzyme B secretion. In these experiments, both antigen specific CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cells were activated by HIvax vaccines with resultant cytotoxic activity against survivin-overexpressing <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>cancer</b> cells.

40|$|BACKGROUND, Gemcitabine {{has shown}} {{activity}} {{in patients with}} less chemosensitive solid tumors. Phase II screening of novel drugs is an accepted method with which to investigate new therapies in malignant mesothelioma. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Lung Cancer Cooperative Group has performed several sequential Phase II trials of new agents {{for the treatment of}} mesothelioma over the last 10 years. METHODS. Twenty-seven chemotherapy-naive patients with histologically proven malignant mesothelioma were treated with gemcitabine as a 30 -minute intravenous administration of 1250 mg/m(2) on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 -day cycle. Therapy continued for up to ten cycles unless disease progression or excessive toxicity mandated discontinuation. RESULTS, With a median relative dose intensity of 96 %, toxicity was mild and neutropenia of {{greater than or equal to}} Grade 3 (according to National Cancer Institute criteria) occurred in 30 % of patients, without episodes of febrile neutropenia. One case of hemolytic-uremic syndrome, most likely related to gemcitabine use, was observed. Overall, 2 objective responses were observed (response rate of 7 %; 95 % confidence interval, 1 - 24 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Administration of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) {{has shown}} some effects on {{malignant}} pleural mesothelioma (MPM) tumour regression. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the ability of IL- 2 to modify immunological effector cells and angiogenesis in MPM patients and their prognostic value. METHODS: Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD 4, CD 8, Foxp 3), mast cells (MCs) (tryptase and chymase), microvessel count (MVC) and VEGF were determined by immunohistochemistry in two series of MPM patients: 60 patients treated with intra-pleural preoperative IL- 2 and 33 patients untreated. RESULTS: Tryptase MCs, and CD 8 and Foxp 3 lymphocytes were significantly increased in the IL- 2 -treated group, whereas MVC was significantly lower in the same group. Moreover, in the IL- 2 -treated group, greater tryptase + MCs and greater Foxp 3 lymphocytes were associated with improved and poorer clinical outcomes, respectively. Notably, when these two immunological parameters were combined, they predicted outcomes more effectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that IL- 2 treatment leads to a significant increase of immunological parameters, concomitantly with a reduction in vasculature, providing new insight into the cancer mechanisms mediated by IL- 2. Moreover, these results suggest that tryptase-positive MCs and Foxp 3 + lymphocytes predict clinical outcomes in IL- 2 -treated patients, highlighting the critical role of the inflammatory response in <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>cancer</b> progression.

40|$|IntroductionMalignant pleural {{mesothelioma}} {{is a highly}} aggressive neoplasm with an incidence that is increasing world-wide. Mast cells {{are part of the}} innate immune system and have been associated with different solid tumors, but there is controversy surrounding their pro- and antitumorigenic effects in cancers. There are two subsets of human mast cells, resulting from the expression of different enzymes: tryptase positive mast cells and chymase positive mast cells. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the presence and prognostic significance of tumor infiltrating mast cells in mesothelioma. MethodsTryptase and chymase mast cell counts were determined by immunohistochemistry in 60 patients with mesothelioma. All pathologic samples were from patients who underwent treatment with intrapleural preoperative interleukin- 2 (18 × 106 IU/d for 3 days). After one day of recovery, patients underwent surgery. Pleural samples were also immunostained for CD 34 to evaluate microvessel count. ResultsHigh tryptase mast cells counts were found in the majority (73. 3 %) of the cases studied, and the results were significantly associated with both overall survival (p = 0. 02) and time to progression (p = 0. 01). This finding was confirmed using multivariate analysis: a higher tryptase mast cells count emerged as an independent favorable prognostic factor (p = 0. 02). However, tryptase mast cells count did not show significant correlation with microvessel count. ConclusionsThese results suggest that tumor infiltrating tryptase mast cells, after interleukin- 2 preoperative induction therapy, predict improved clinical outcome in patients with malignant {{pleural mesothelioma}}, and highlight the critical role of the local inflammatory response in <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>cancer</b> progression...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePurpose The {{objective}} {{of this article was}} to estimate the social cost of respiratory cancer cases attributable to occupational risk factors in France in 2010. Methods According to the attributable fraction method and based on available epidemiological data from the lit- erature, we estimated the number of respiratory cancer cases due to each identified risk factor. We used the cost- of-illness method with a prevalence-based approach. We took into account the direct and indirect costs. We estimated the cost of production losses due to morbidity (absenteeism and presenteeism) and mortality costs (years of production losses) in the market and nonmarket spheres. Results The social cost of lung, larynx, sinonasal and <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>cancer</b> caused by exposure to asbestos, chromium, diesel engine exhaust, paint, crystalline silica, wood and leather dust in France in 2010 were estimated at between 917 and 2, 181 million euros. Between 795 and 2, 011 million euros (87 - 92 %) of total costs were due to lung cancer alone. Asbestos was by far the risk factor representing the greatest cost to French society in 2010 at between 531 and 1, 538 million euros (58 - 71 %), ahead of diesel engine exhaust, representing an estimated social cost of between 233 and 336 million euros, and crystalline silica (119 - 229 million euros).

40|$|Pleural {{malignant}} mesothelioma is an uncommon neoplasm {{usually associated with}} asbestos exposure. The increasing incidence of {{malignant mesothelioma}} cases involving individuals {{with low levels of}} asbestos exposure suggests a complex carcinogenetic process with the involvement of other cofactors. Cytogenetic studies revealed the complexity of the genetic changes involved in this neoplasm reflecting the accumulation of genomic damage. One of the most used methodologies for assessing genomic damage is the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus test applied in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). This approach allows the detection of chromosomal alterations expressed in binucleated cells after nuclear division in vitro. This marker could provide a tool for assessing genetically determined constitutional differences in chromosomal instability. A biomonitoring study was carried out to evaluate the micronuclei frequency in PBLs of patients with pleural malignant mesothelioma with respect to lung cancer, healthy, and risk controls as a marker of cancer susceptibility in correlation with the presence of SV 40. A significant increased micronuclei frequency was observed in patients with malignant mesothelioma in comparison with all the other groups, the mean micronuclei frequency was double in patients with malignant mesothelioma compared with healthy controls, risk controls, and patients with lung adenocarcinoma (median 11. 4 binucleated cells with micronuclei/ 1, 000 binucleated cells versus 6. 2, 6. 1, and 5. 1, respectively). Our data indicate that human T lymphocyte samples carry DNA sequences coding for SV 40 large T antigen at low prevalence, both in cancer cases and controls. Evidence of cytogenetic damage revealed as micronuclei frequency in <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>cancer</b> patients could be related to exogenous and endogenous cofactors besides asbestos exposure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundMalignant pleural {{mesothelioma}} (MPM) {{is a highly}} aggressive tumor that arises from the surface cells of the pleura with a poor survival rate. Fibulin- 3 is a protein biomarker found in blood and pleural fluid of patients with mesothelioma and can reliably predict the presence, or absence, of <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>cancer</b> cells. The possible role of fibulin- 3 in diagnosis of MPM was studied. Patients and methodsSixty patients {{were included in the}} study, 30 with pleural effusions due to MPM and another 30 with non mesothelioma malignant pleural effusion (MPE). Plasma and pleural effusion fibulin- 3 levels were estimated for all patients using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELIZA). ResultsPlasma and pleural effusion fibulin- 3 levels were significantly higher in patients with MPM (113 ± 3. 7 ng/ml and 594. 2 ± 65. 7 ng/ml, respectively) compared to those with non mesothelioma MPE (44. 4 ± 7. 1 ng/ml and 187. 3 ± 14. 5 ng/ml, respectively) (P< 0. 001). Plasma and effusion fibulin- 3 levels discriminated significantly between patients with MPM and those with non mesothelioma MPE, with area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of 0. 98 and 0. 94, respectively, at cut-off values of 54. 3 ng/ml for plasma fibulin- 3 and 520 ng/ml for effusion fibulin- 3, with sensitivity of 100 % and 90 %, specificity of 96. 7 % for both, positive predictive value (PPV) of 96. 8 % and 96. 4 % and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100 % and 90. 6 %, respectively.
