5|$|In 1989, {{a project}} was started to bring Bodø/Glimt {{back to the}} top league. Among the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>issues</b> was to secure better {{training}} facilities, particularly during the Arctic winter. The club proposed upgrading the artificial turf field at Aspmyra with a new field with under-soil heating, in addition to constructing both a new gravel pitch and an indoor training hall with a full-size pitch. The Municipal Committee for Sport and Culture stated that they wanted to prioritize the artificial turf field over a gravel pitch. They therefore proposed that NOK3.5 million be allocated to lay under-soil heating on the artificial turf pitch and remove the turf. New artificial turf would be laid at a later date, when funding could be allocated. This was agreed upon, construction started on 24 October 1989 and was scheduled for completion ahead of the winter training. However, the Football Association of Norway (NFF) stated that the club {{would not be allowed to}} play their matches on a gravel pitch, and the grass at Aspmyra was in so bad condition that it would not be permitted for play in the top league, should the team be promoted. The municipal council therefore gave grants to finance a new artificial turf on the training pitch, which was taken into use in 1990.|$|E

25|$|One of the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>issues</b> of the 2006 {{elections}} is the economy. The high {{external debt}} and internal debt have inhibited growth. Around 75% {{of the population}} lives on less than US$2 a day, unemployment and underemployment are close to 50%, and income inequality is very pronounced. However, {{there have been some}} recent improvements. Real economic growth declined from 7.4% in 1999 to 1% in 2002, then turned around to grow back to 2.3% in 2003, and about 4% in 2004.|$|E

25|$|Research {{indicated}} that BNP voters also held opinions that were {{distinct from the}} average British citizen. They were far more pessimistic about their economic prospects than average, with seven out of ten BNP voters expecting their economic prospects to decline in future, contrasted with four out of ten who held this view in the wider population. In the 2002–06 period, 59% of BNP voters considered immigration {{to be the most}} important issue facing the UK, compared with only 16% of the wider population who agreed. By 2009, 87% of BNP voters identified immigration and asylum as the most important issue, to 49% of the wider population.

25|$|With the Revolution, {{the city}} {{administration}} suddenly found itself without a royal master. On 15 July 1789, {{immediately after the}} fall of the Bastille, the astronomer Bailly was proclaimed the first modern Mayor of Paris. The old city government was abolished on 15 August, and a new municipal assembly created, with three hundred members, five from each of sixty Paris districts. On 21 May 1790, the National Assembly reorganized the city government, replacing the sixty districts with forty-eight sections. each governed by sixteen commissaires and a comissiaire of police. Each section had its own committees responsible for charity, armament, and surveillance of the citizens. The Mayor was elected for two years, and was supported by sixteen administrators overseeing five departments, including the police, finances, public works, public establishments, public works, and food supplies. The Municipal Council had thirty-two elected members. Above this was the Council General of the Commune, composed the Mayor, the Municipal Council, the city administrators, and ninety six notables, which met only to discuss the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>issues.</b> This system was too complex and meetings were regularly disrupted by the representatives of the more radical sections.|$|E

Nevertheless, public interest in the issue has since decreased. In April 2014, the government announced that they would sign a [...] "Memorandum of Understanding" [...] with NATO on Finland's readiness to receive military assistance and to aid NATO in equipment maintenance. However, Defence Minister Carl Haglund emphasized that this memorandum would not be a step towards membership.|$|E

And all of those things I feel happy to express". Caitlin White of The 405 believed the songs as [...] "hold forth on the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>issues</b> in a woman's life by delving into [...] personal experience with them". [...] "Jealous" [...] addresses fidelity and features lyrics in which the protagonist experiences [...] "promises, suspicion and potential revenge". It contains an [...] "uncanny mix of tones and styles", most prominently a morose bassline replete with electronic yelps. [...] "Mine", a futuristic R song with jazz elements, is self-reflective, with lyrics that reference marital strife and difficulties with postnatal depression. The neo soul song [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] is a self-empowerment anthem that decries society's obsession with harmful and unattainable standards of beauty. The song uses audio snippets of beauty pageants which Beyoncé contested in to frame the song in the context of her childhood.|$|E

Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone described it as [...] "an emotional rollercoaster that at times may have been jarring or heavy-handed, but overall did what a winter finale should: gave us plenty of surprises, while setting things up for the future". IGN's Robert Canning was [...] "won over by a powerfully acted and directed story" [...] and gave the episode a [...] "great" [...] rating of 8.0 out of 10; he noted that [...] "as is often the case, the smaller stories involving Karofsky and Quinn were more successful than larger arcs like Rachel and Finn's". Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle said that rather than [...] "a million different storylines" [...] {{there were a few}} [...] "really good ones" [...] and added, [...] "It was chaos, but controlled chaos." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "The sequence in which Karofsky prepared himself for death was, unquestionably, {{one of the best things}} Glee has ever done." [...] He added that it was [...] "all the more a shame" [...] that it occurred in an episode that did not know how to make effective use of [...] "the impact of that moment", and he gave the episode as a whole a [...] "D" [...] grade. In a similar vein, James Poniewozik of Time said, [...] "the beginning of the episode was a very effective 15 minutes or so of television", but said that was also the episode's problem. Michael Slezak of TVLine noted that the show's [...] "audacity" [...] allowed it [...] "to tackle some of the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>issues</b> of the day with a headiness and honesty that aren’t merely refreshing, but absolutely necessary", and added, [...] "If I’ve got any complaint with the episode, it would have to be that for a show that’s billed as a musical comedy, there certainly weren’t many laughs, and the musical interludes seemed like something of an afterthought". In a similar vein, Billboard Rae Votta wrote, [...] "Any thoughts that Glee is, in fact, a comedy should be soundly crushed by now. It's a fantastical reality, and sometimes you laugh at that, but other times you cry." ...|$|E

Following Wlezien?s work, two interpretations of the question can be sketched: (1) personal (the <b>issue</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> to the respondent) and (2) contextual (the issue that respondents perceive as topping the national political agenda). Using British Election Study data from 2005, the author shows that issues prominent in that campaign were often cited as <b>most</b> <b>important</b> by respondents who were neither particularly knowledgeable about those issues nor particularly influenced by them when voting. In sum, the contextual interpretation predominates. Hence, whatever else it is, ?<b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue?</b> is not an accurate gauge of salience effects in models of vote choice...|$|R
