25|$|T-SQL (Transact-SQL) is the {{secondary}} means of programming and managing SQL Server. It exposes keywords for the operations {{that can be}} performed on SQL Server, including creating and altering database schemas, entering and editing data in the database as well as monitoring and managing the server itself. Client applications that consume data or manage the server will leverage SQL Server functionality by sending T-SQL queries and statements which are then processed by the server and results (or errors) returned to the client application. SQL Server allows it to be managed using T-SQL. For this it exposes read-only tables from which server statistics can be read. Management functionality is exposed via system-defined stored procedures which can be invoked from T-SQL queries to perform the <b>management</b> <b>operation.</b> It is also possible to create linked Servers using T-SQL. Linked servers allow a single query to process operations performed on multiple servers.|$|E
500|$|Their {{marriage}} was {{registered in the}} Delft population register on 10 November 1869. Their first home was a modest apartment on a canal, but they moved frequently after that. As of 2012, all of their homes are still standing and all are classified as historic buildings. Their last home, to which they moved on 3 June 1885, was a villa in Agnetapark, Delft. When Matthes learnt that their marriage would be childless, she decided to dedicate her life to her husband's business and career, and participated in the establishment and <b>management</b> <b>operation.</b> She accompanied her husband to the factory every day, having her own office. She also continued to have private lessons. In addition to administrative activities, their main interests were personnel policy issues. Matthes and van Marken maintained close contact with the employees of the factory and their families, which appealed to the couple's sense of community; {{they wanted to be}} part [...] "of a larger whole". Agneta Matthes shared her husband's belief in progress, and they both promoted the personal development of their employees.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{developing}} countries which {{plan to go}} nuclear have very poor industrial safety records and problems with political corruption. Inside China, and outside the country, {{the speed of the}} nuclear construction program has raised safety concerns. Prof [...] He Zuoxiu, who was involved with China's atomic bomb program, has said that plans to expand production of nuclear energy twentyfold by 2030 could be disastrous, as China was seriously underprepared on the safety front. China's fast-expanding nuclear sector is opting for cheap technology that [...] "will be 100 years old by the time dozens of its reactors reach the end of their lifespans", according to diplomatic cables from the US embassy in Beijing. The rush to build new nuclear power plants may [...] "create problems for effective <b>management,</b> <b>operation</b> and regulatory oversight" [...] with the biggest potential bottleneck being human resources – [...] "coming up with enough trained personnel to build and operate all of these new plants, as well as regulate the industry". The challenge for the government and nuclear companies is to [...] "keep an eye on a growing army of contractors and subcontractors who may be tempted to cut corners". [...] China is advised to maintain nuclear safeguards in a business culture where quality and safety are sometimes sacrificed in favor of cost-cutting, profits, and corruption. China has asked for international assistance in training more nuclear power plant inspectors.|$|E
