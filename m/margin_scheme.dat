40|$|The {{purpose of}} a margin {{requirement}} is to protect a clearinghouse from members' defaults resulting from big losses due to adverse movement of futures prices. To decide on how much a margin is required, a clearinghouse may refer to a benchmark margin defined as a constant multiple of the forecasted volatility. However, a benchmark margin only advises on a desirable margin level. It gives no advice on whether a clearinghouse should alter existing required margin. This paper proposes a <b>margin</b> <b>scheme</b> that can advise on when to change the required margin and if a change is recommended, to what level it should be changed. The proposed <b>margin</b> <b>scheme</b> can be devised so that the coverage probability and change frequency are controlled at target levels deemed appropriate by the clearinghouse. The proposed <b>margin</b> <b>scheme</b> needs a volatility forecast as input. This paper shows that among {{a large number of}} volatility forecasts, implied volatility gives the best results. This confirms a conjecture that implied volatility may have more information content than other volatility forecasts as far as margin setting is concerned. © 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the effect of value-added tax on small to medium-sized developers of residential properties in South Africa. Firstly, the way value-added tax is applied to residential properties in South Africa was established. It was ascertained that no special concessions exist with regard to housing. Secondly, the application of value-added tax to residential properties in the United Kingdom was discussed. It was ascertained that supplies relating to new residential premises are zero-rated. Thirdly, the application {{of goods and services}} tax to residential properties in Canada was discussed. Canadian goods and services tax and harmonious sales tax legislation contains a broad range of special concessions relating to residential property developments. The harmonious sales tax which applies in some provinces, is a combination of goods and services tax and a provincial sales tax. Fourthly, the way goods and services tax is applied to residential property developments in Australia was determined. Australian legislation provides for a <b>margin</b> <b>scheme</b> to be applied to the development of residential properties. In terms of the <b>margin</b> <b>scheme,</b> goods and services tax is payable on the basis of profit rather than turnover. Transfer duty as applied in South Africa was examined {{as an alternative to the}} value-added tax being applied on residential properties developed by developers registered for value-added tax purposes. The legislation with regard to developers of residential properties registered for value-added tax, goods and services tax and harmonious sales tax purposes was measured against the principles of taxation. On the basis of these results, an alternative to the current application of value-added tax relating to developers registered for value-added tax purposes in South Africa was proposed that would be in line with that of the selected countries.

The transfer of the residual reserve credit capital from shareholders to creditors at bank default results in a unilateral CVA, consistent with the regulatory requirement that capital should not diminish as an effect of the sole deterioration of the bank credit spread. Our funding cost for variation margin (FVA) is defined asymmetrically since there is no benefit in holding excess capital in the future. Capital is fungible as a source of funding for variation margin, causing a material FVA reduction. We introduce a specialist initial <b>margin</b> lending <b>scheme</b> that drastically reduces the funding cost for initial margin (MVA). Our capital valuation adjustment (KVA) is defined as a risk premium, i.e. the cost of remunerating shareholder capital at risk at some hurdle rate.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the impact of}} threshold-based {{incentive}} schemes, commonly used in the automotive industry, on both expected sales and sales variability. We model the effect of such incentives in two specific scenarios: an exclusive dealership selling products for only one manufacturer and a non-exclusive dealership selling products for multiple manufacturers. For an exclusive dealer we show that a threshold contract, with a positive bonus on crossing the threshold value, not only increases the expected sales, but more importantly, decreases the variance of the orders placed by the dealer. We show that if the manufacturer associates a positive cost with sales variance, a threshold-based incentive, with a positive bonus, is superior to other schemes without a bonus offering. We then show that manufacturers continuing to offer such incentives to non-exclusive dealers may experience increase in variance {{and a decrease in}} expected profits. This implies that when manufacturers must compete for dealer effort, threshold-based incentives can hurt manufacturers. In such instances it may be beneficial to switch to a constant <b>margin</b> incentive <b>scheme...</b>|$|R

40|$|Efficient radio {{resource}} management (RRM) for CDMA-based cellular communication systems using the interfer-ence guard <b>margin</b> (IGM) <b>scheme</b> is investigated in this work. Two important concepts, i. e., the guard channel (GC) and the load curve (LC), are integrated to derive IGM. The resulting call admission control (CAC) scheme gives pref-erential treatment to higher priority handoff calls by pre-reserving {{a certain amount}} of resource in terms of IGM. A {{radio resource}} estimation (RRE) function is implemented in each base station (BS) to assist RRM module to adjust the level of IGM dynamically. RRE in each BS estimates the amount of IGM by considering traffic load in its current cell as well as traffic conditions in neighboring cells. A service model is adopted to support quality of service (QoS) demand of multiple services, which includes mobile terminals data rate, different levels of priorities, mobility and rate adaptivity characteristics. Simulations are conducted by OPNET to study performance of the proposed IGM scheme in terms of a defined cost function, new call blocking probability, handoff dropping probability and system utilization, under different traffic conditions. 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|International audienceFollowing {{the success}} of hashing methods for multidimensional indexing, more and more works are {{interested}} in embedding visual feature space in compact hash codes. Such approaches are not an alternative to using index structures but a complementary way to reduce both the memory usage and the distance computation cost. Several data dependent hash functions have notably been proposed to closely ﬁt data distribution and provide better selectivity than usual random projections such as LSH. However, improvements occur only for relatively small hash code sizes up to 64 or 128 bits. As discussed in the paper, this is mainly {{due to the lack}} of independence between the produced hash functions. We introduce a new hash function family that attempts to solve this issue in any kernel space. Rather than boosting the collision probability of close points, our method focus on data scattering. By training purely random splits of the data, regardless the closeness of the training samples, it is indeed possible to generate consistently more independent hash functions. On the other side, the use of large margin classiﬁers allows to maintain good generalization performances. Experiments show that our new Random Maximum <b>Margin</b> Hashing <b>scheme</b> (RMMH) outperforms four state-of-the-art hashing methods, notably in kernel spaces...|$|R

Therefore, the objective of this research was to assess and compare risks for conventional and organic farming in the Netherlands with respect to gross margin and the underlying price and production variables.

To assess risk, an error component implicit detrending method was applied and the resulting detrended standard deviations were compared between conventional and organic farms. Results indicate that the risk included in the gross margin per cow is significantly higher in organic farming. This is caused by both higher price and production risks.

As the probability of handover requests is directly proportional to the mobile velocity, the handover response should be made dependent on mobile velocity to avoid unwanted call termination and early handover for high and low velocity vehicles respectively. Due to the dependency of handover performance to path loss exponent, a variable hysteresis scheme has already been proposed. As the handover performance is highly dependent on user velocity, if the hysteresis margin is made adaptive and varied dynamically in a complimentary manner with mobile velocity, the call termination as well as unnecessary handover may be minimized for high and low velocity mobiles respectively. In this work, a variable hysteresis <b>margin</b> based handover <b>scheme</b> is thus proposed and studied which takes care of both path loss exponent and mobile velocity.

30|$|Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing access (OFDMA) is a promising technique for {{high data rate}} transmission in wideband wireless systems [1, 2]. In OFDMA systems, the total bandwidth is divided into many orthogonal narrowband subcarriers, with different subcarriers allocated to different users to enable flexible multi-user access. Transmission power allocation represents {{an effective way to}} increase the throughput of wireless communication systems [3]. According to different optimization objectives and constraints, adaptive power allocation schemes for OFDMA systems can be roughly divided into two categories: rate adaptive (RA) <b>schemes</b> and <b>margin</b> adaptive (MA) <b>schemes.</b> Rate adaptive schemes seek the maximization of the system throughput under a total and/or individual transmit power constraints [4 – 6], while MA schemes try to minimize the overall transmission power with constraints on individual and/or system data rates [7 – 9]. It is shown that the optimal power allocation policy of the above schemes often leads to the form of a WF solution. However, traditional WF solutions are simple to evaluate because all of them consider a single power constraint (known as waterlevel). As a consequence, it is quite straightforward to compute the solution numerically. However, some other optimization problems (such as multi-user or multiple transmission points) would result in complicated non-convex problems. For such cases, {{it may be difficult to}} obtain closed-form solutions or practical algorithms.|$|R

Intelligent and adaptive Radio Resource Management (RRM) schemes are a fundamental tool {{in the design of}} wireless systems to be able to fully and efficiently utilize the available scarce resources and be able to meet the user data rates and QoS requirements. Previous works were only concerned with maximizing system efficiency and thus used opportunistic algorithms that allocate resources to users with the best opportunities to optimize system capacity.

The main objective of our study is to design adaptive radio resource allocation (RRA) algorithms that distribute the scarce resources more fairly among network users while efficiently using the resources to maximize system throughput.
