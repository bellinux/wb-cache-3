5|$|In time, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia was victorious {{and placed}} the relics in a church in Brookwood Cemetery in Woking, with the enshrinement {{ceremony}} occurring in September 1984. The St Edward Brotherhood of monks was organized there as well. The church is now named St Edward the Martyr Orthodox Church, and it is {{under the jurisdiction of}} a traditionalist Greek Orthodox community. However, while the bones are of approximately the right date, they are of a <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>late</b> twenties or early thirties rather than a youth in his mid teens.|$|E

They escape the swarms of infected surrounding the school, and find themselves in an abandoned house, where Bill discovers his partner, Frank, has committed suicide by hanging there, and it is revealed that the two had had a falling out and Frank had been planning to escape in Bill's car. After getting the car started, Joel drops Bill off, and expresses sympathy for what happened between him and Frank. Bill merely responds by ensuring that their debt is settled and then ordering Joel to leave the town.|$|E

500|$|Aamir Khan {{agreed to}} act in Rang De Basanti {{immediately}} after reading Mehra's script. Mehra described his character as a simple man with {{a strong sense of}} integrity and dignity. Khan, who would turn 40 during the shoot, lost about [...] with a strict diet and exercise regime to more convincingly depict a <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>late</b> twenties. Atul Kulkarni and Kunal Kapoor were publicly attached to the film {{by the time it was}} officially announced; Kapoor had been the assistant director to Mehra during the filming of Aks and was already familiar with the material Mehra had been developing. Mehra gave Kulkarni biographies of Ram Prasad Bismil as preparation, including Bismil's autobiography. Early rumors indicated that actors Arjun Rampal and Arjan Bajwa would be amongst the male leads, but these roles ultimately were filled by Sharman Joshi, Siddharth Narayan and R. Madhavan.|$|E

2500|$|On June 6, 2013, {{during the}} annual Konami Pre-E3 show, Konami {{confirmed}} that actor Kiefer Sutherland provided Snake's voice and performed motion capture {{work for the}} game, taking a role over voice actor David Hayter. Kojima's reason for replacing Hayter was to [...] "have a more subdued performance expressed through subtle facial movements and tone of voice rather than words", and that he [...] "needed someone who could genuinely convey both the facial and vocal qualities of a <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>late</b> 40s". Hollywood producer and director Avi Arad suggested to Kojima that Sutherland could fulfill his requirements. Akio Ōtsuka was unaffected by this casting change and continued to voice Snake in the Japanese version. On March 4, 2015, Kojima revealed that Snake would have less dialogue in The Phantom Pain than previous installments. The reasoning behind it was to make Snake come across as an extension to the player and that he [...] "will act based on [...] rather than doing things like making spontaneous comments or flirting with women." ...|$|E

60|$|Under {{cover of}} a mist that has settled over the scene, a few years flit by, and escape our notice. As the {{atmosphere}} becomes transparent, we perceive a decrepit grandsire, hobbling along the street. Do you recognize him? We saw him, first, as the baby in Goodwife Massey's arms, when the primeval trees were flinging their shadow over Roger Conant's cabin; we have seen him, as the boy, the youth, the man, bearing <b>his</b> humble part <b>in</b> all the successive scenes, and forming the index-figure whereby to note the age of his coeval town. And here he is, old Goodman Massey, taking his last walk,--often pausing,--often leaning over his staff,--and calling to mind whose dwelling stood at such and such a spot, and whose field or garden occupied the site of those more recent houses. He can render a reason for all the bends and deviations of the thoroughfare, which, in its flexible and plastic infancy, was made to swerve aside from a straight line, in order to visit every settler's door. The Main Street is still youthful; the coeval <b>man</b> is <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>latest</b> age. Soon he will be gone, a patriarch of fourscore, yet shall retain a sort of infantine life in our local history, as the first town-born child.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the life work of a man named Jacque Fresco. This <b>man</b> is {{currently}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>late</b> 90 ’s and has had a colourful past. His influence is global - he has started social uprisings, orchestrated political campaigns, toured the world {{as part of a}} lecture series and featured in several widely viewed films. Before this study, there was not a comprehensive study of the man. This research has taken into account, as much as possible, all the work that Fresco has produced. Additionally, this study makes use of a personal interview conducted by the researcher {{for the purpose of this}} study. This study has closely analysed Fresco’s ideas. As a result of this, Fresco’s true beliefs are exposed. Following this exposition of Fresco’s true beliefs, a critical engagement is presented. His ideas are contrasted against that of other prominent social scientists. Specifically, this study discusses Fresco work and the subject of ‘crime’. Finally, the usefulness of Fresco’s work is scrutinised...|$|R
60|$|When {{the general}} horror and dismay {{was at its}} height, the Blackbird himself was struck down with the malady. The poor savages, when they saw their chief in danger, forgot their own miseries, and {{surrounded}} his dying bed. His dominant spirit, and his love for the white <b>men,</b> were evinced <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>latest</b> breath, with which he designated his place of sepulture. It was {{to be on a}} hill or promontory, upwards of four hundred feet in height, overlooking a great extent of the Missouri, from whence he had been accustomed to watch for the barks of the white men. The Missouri washes the base of the promontory, and after winding and doubling in many links and mazes in the plain below, returns to within nine hundred yards of its starting-place; so that for thirty miles navigating with sail and oar the voyager finds himself continually near to this singular promontory as if spell-bound.|$|R

50|$|The story {{revolves}} around Reba- a smart, intelligent, charming and independent fashion model. The special feature which makes her attractive is her eyes. She has unique tiger-eyes or cat-eyes. Her beauty {{helped her to}} support her family when her father died {{and she was the}} eldest besides her mother who was in the hospital. Reba was very attached to her family and to save her mother she decided to take up modelling. Her modelling career took her to great heights. She had several feathers in her cap. In her journey she also came in touch with many gentlemen. Out of these gentlemen was a man of a royal family- Eliot Thorson III. THis <b>man</b> was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>late</b> twenties, tall, tanned, with blue eyes and golden hair. He had inherited a great fortune and a well-known chain of hotels. He had a false impression on Reba of being generous. On one fine evening, he proposed Reba to which Reba answered that she would tell her reply after her photo shoot. This photo shoot was going to continue for weeks and on her first day she met a dark, strong, muscular person with whom she fell in love at first sight- Hunter Jamieson. The love blossoms between both of them but the destiny shows her true colours and it is learnt that Reba's mother is critical and needed money as soon as she can for operation. Reba does {{not know what to do}} and at that moment she thinks that the only way her mother could be alive was Reba sacrificing her love and marrying Eliot. Reba decided that Hunter had to move on in life and for him she made him hate her. Hunter thought of her to be a gold-digger. With a stone of her heart, she returned to Eliot and got engaged to him. Only before a few months of marriage Eliot decided to let Reba meet his family. Reba was in no trouble until she came to know that Hunter was Eliot's cousin and had inherited the same amount of property as Eliot had. Blackmailing Reba again and again, Hunter made Reba break her engagement and after breaking the engagement she came to know that Eliot was a cheat and was double-dating. Now as the engagement was no more, Reba couldn't get the money and to save the situation Hunter offered Reba to be his mistress. He would pay her for having sex with him. Reba accepted the offer and fulfilled her part but Hunter did not pay her. To get the money, Reba went to Hunter but he carried her off to some place. Later learning that it was her mother he has got to meet, Reba thanks him and both of them live happily ever after.|$|R
