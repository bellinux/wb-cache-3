25|$|In 1900, Bessemer ranked {{eighth in}} {{population}} in the state, second in amount of capital invested in manufacturing, and fourth {{in the value of}} its <b>manufactured</b> <b>product</b> for the year. By 1911, ore mining, iron smelting and the manufacture of iron and coke were the chief industries of Bessemer; truck farming was also an important industry. Both blacks and whites from rural areas were attracted to the city for its work opportunities. Gradually African Americans moved into industrial jobs and were part of integrated unions; such jobs enabled working-class families to enjoy middle-class incomes.|$|E
25|$|Fabless licensees, {{who wish}} to {{integrate}} an ARM core into their own chip design, are usually only interested in acquiring a ready-to-manufacture verified semiconductor intellectual property core. For these customers, ARM Holdings delivers a gate netlist description of the chosen ARM core, along with an abstracted simulation model and test programs to aid design integration and verification. More ambitious customers, including integrated device manufacturers (IDM) and foundry operators, choose to acquire the processor IP in synthesizable RTL (Verilog) form. With the synthesizable RTL, the customer {{has the ability to}} perform architectural level optimisations and extensions. This allows the designer to achieve exotic design goals not otherwise possible with an unmodified netlist (high clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions, etc.). While ARM Holdings does not grant the licensee the right to resell the ARM architecture itself, licensees may freely sell <b>manufactured</b> <b>product</b> such as chip devices, evaluation boards and complete systems. Merchant foundries can be a special case; not only are they allowed to sell finished silicon containing ARM cores, they generally hold the right to re-manufacture ARM cores for other customers.|$|E

500|$|Public {{reception}} of Gaga's music, fashion sense, and persona is polarized. Because of her influence on modern culture, and her rise to global fame, sociologist Mathieu Deflem of the University of South Carolina {{has offered a}} course titled [...] "Lady Gaga and the Sociology of the Fame" [...] since early 2011 {{with the objective of}} unraveling [...] "some of the sociologically relevant dimensions of the fame of Lady Gaga". When Gaga met briefly with politician Barack Obama at a Human Rights Campaign fundraiser, he found the interaction [...] "intimidating" [...] as she was dressed in 16-inch heels, making her the tallest woman in the room. When interviewed by Barbara Walters for her annual ABC News special 10 Most Fascinating People in 2009, Gaga dismissed the claim that she is intersex as an urban legend. Responding to a question on this issue, she expressed her fondness for androgyny. In a 2010 Sunday Times article, Camille Paglia criticized Gaga as [...] "more an identity thief than an erotic taboo breaker, a mainstream <b>manufactured</b> <b>product</b> who claims to be singing for the freaks, the rebellious and the dispossessed when she is none of those".|$|E

2500|$|In Ireland, {{large-scale}} {{domestic and}} industrial peat usage is widespread. In the Republic of Ireland, a state-owned company called [...] {{is responsible for}} managing peat extraction.

These are oblong bars of densely compressed, dried, and shredded peat. Peat moss is a <b>manufactured</b> <b>product</b> for use in garden cultivation.

Belli argued (in cases such as Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., in 1944, which arose from an incident in which a restaurant manager from Merced, California was injured by an exploding Coca-Cola bottle) that all products have an implied warranty, that it is to be foreseen that products will be used by a long chain of people, not just the direct recipient of the <b>manufactured</b> <b>product,</b> and that negligence by a defendant need not be proven if the defendant's product is defective.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1950s, Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) {{carried out}} world leading {{research}} into flat plate {{solar water heater}}s. A solar water heater manufacturing industry was subsequently established in Australia and {{a large proportion of}} the <b>manufactured</b> <b>product</b> was exported. Four of the original companies are still in business and the manufacturing base has now expanded to 24 companies. Despite an excellent solar resource, the penetration of solar water heaters in the Australian domestic market was only about 5% in 2006, with new dwellings accounting for most sales. By 2014, around 14% of Australian households had solar hot water installed [...] It is estimated that by installing a solar hot water system, it could reduce a family's CO2 emissions up to 3tonnes per year while saving up to 80% of the energy costs for water heating.|$|E
2500|$|On December 18, 2010, {{a message}} from Hayley, Jeremy, and Taylor was {{released}} through Paramore.net stating that Josh and Zac were leaving the band. The band also confirmed the scheduled South American tour would still happen. Josh Farro wrote a statement on the departure on his Blogger, claiming that the band was [...] "a <b>manufactured</b> <b>product</b> of a major-label." [...] He accused Hayley Williams of being manipulated by her management, treating {{the rest of the}} group as her solo project, and claimed she was the only member of the band who was signed to Atlantic Records, while her bandmates were simply [...] "riding on the coattails of her dream". On December 30, 2010, MTV News interviewed Williams, York and Davis in Franklin, Tennessee regarding their reactions to Farro's response. The interview aired on MTV.com on January 7, 2011 as Paramore: The Last Word. While the band confirmed many of Farro's statements, notably that Williams was indeed the only member of the band actually signed to Atlantic, they said they felt the statement was irrelevant, adding that they had addressed many of the claims made already throughout the course of their career.|$|E
