While rare, muse cells are identifiable by their expression of SSEA-3, a marker for undifferentiated stem cells, and general mesenchymal stem cells markers such as CD105.

40|$|International audienceTransplanted <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> migrate toward brain lesions and {{differentiate}} into neurons, glial <b>cells,</b> and neural <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in diseased {{or injured}} animal models. The migratory routes and differentiation patterns of <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in normal rats are, however, unknown. Here, labelled human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (or saline) were transplanted into the striatum of adult rats to observe their migration and differentiation. METHODS:Labelled human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were transplanted {{into the right}} striatum of adults rats (n = 24). Brain sections were examined for migratory routes of labelled human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> by immunohistochemistry method, fluorescence microscope and laser scanning confocal microscopy observation, and Prussian blue staining. Moreover, the differentiation of human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> was detected by double immunohistochemistry. RESULTS:After 3 days, most human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> resided around the injection sites. Human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were found in or around the corpus callosum and the subependymal layer after 7 days. A great number of human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were detected throughout the brain on both ipsilateral and contralateral sides after 14 days. A high concentration of donor cells persisted in the corpus callosum, the external capsule and the subventricular zone. In addition, the incorporated human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were neuronal nuclei- and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive. CONCLUSION:Human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> migrate throughout the brain mainly along with the axis of corpus callosum external capsule and the subependymal layer, and differentiate into neurons and astrocytes rather than neural <b>stem</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

We wanted to study whether adult human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> survive and engraft in {{experimentally}} induced ischemic rat myocardium. MethodsBone marrow–derived adult human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (2. 5 × 106) were injected into the myocardium of 4 Sprague-Dawley rats. One week after injection, peripheral blood rat lymphocytes were added to adult human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Furthermore, an infarction was created by left anterior descending artery ligation of 8 Sprague-Dawley rats, 4 of which were immunosuppressed with tacrolimus (0. 1 mg/kg/d) and 4 RNU athymic rats. One week after left anterior descending artery ligation, 2. 5 to 3. 5 × 106 adult human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were injected around the infarcted area. The adult human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were identified with {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} technique and myocardial antigens by immunohistochemistry. The immune response was studied by hematoxylin and eosin staining and by antibodies directed toward macrophages. ResultsSignificant rat lymphocyte proliferation was observed when adult human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were added to peripheral blood from Sprague-Dawley rats previously exposed to adult human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> No reactivity was seen in lymphocytes from untreated Sprague-Dawley rats and athymic rats. Adult human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> could only be identified in the myocardium of athymic rats. Further, in normal Sprague-Dawley rats, there was a significant myocardial infiltration of round cells, mostly macrophages, in the area of injection of adult human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> In RNU rats, this reaction was less intense. ConclusionAdult human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> did not induce xenoreactivity in vitro in previously unexposed immunocompetent Sprague-Dawley rats. However, although <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are transplantable across allogeneic barriers, transplant rejection can occur in a xenogenic model.

40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 11 AUG 2013 Adult-derived <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> have received considerable attention {{over the past}} two decades for their potential use in tissue engineering, principally because of their potential to differentiate into multiple stromal-cell lineages. Recently, the immunomodulatory properties of <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> have attracted interest as a unique property of these cells that may be harnessed for novel therapeutic approaches in immune-mediated diseases. <b>Mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of activated T-cells both in vitro and in vivo but to stimulate T-regulatory <b>cell</b> proliferation. <b>Mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are also known to be weakly immunogenic and to exert immunosuppressive effects on B-cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells and neutrophils through various mechanisms. Furthermore, intravenous administration of allogeneic <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> has shown a marked suppression of host immune reactions in preclinical animal models of large-organ transplant rejection and in various autoimmune- and inflammatory-based diseases. Some clinical trials utilizing human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> have also produced promising outcomes in patients with graft-vs. -host disease and autoimmune diseases. <b>Mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> identified from various dental tissues, including periodontal ligament <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> also possess multipotent and immunomodulatory properties. Hence, dental <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> may represent an alternate cell source, not only for tissue regeneration but also as therapies for autoimmune- and inflammatory-mediated diseases. These findings have elicited interest in dental tissue <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> as alternative cell sources for modulating alloreactivity during tissue regeneration following transplantation into human leukocyte antigen-mismatched donors. To examine this potential in periodontal regeneration, future work will need to assess the capacity of allogeneic periodontal ligament <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> to regenerate periodontal ligament in animal models of periodontal disease.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{molecular}} and environmental cues in cardiac differentiation of <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were investigated. The main conclusions {{were that the}} cardiac differentiation potential of human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> negatively correlates with donor age. This in its own shows a negative relationship with connexin 43 levels in these cells. However, a causal relationship between connexin 43 expression levels and cardiomyogenic differentiation potential only exists for human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> from prenatal sources, i. e. while knockdown of connexin 43 expression in fetal human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> inhibits their ability to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, connexin 43 overexpression in adult human <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> does not endow them with cardiomyogenic differentiation capacity.

Acute renal failure (ARF) remains a frequent clinical complication, associated with an unacceptably high mortality rate, in large part due to the ineffectiveness of currently available therapies. The aim of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of bone marrow-derived <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in a rat model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) ARF. MethodsWe used a common I/R model in rats to induce ARF by clamping both renal pedicles for 40 minutes. <b>Mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were iron-dextran-labeled for in vivo tracking studies by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and kidneys were imaged for <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> immediately after infusion and at day 3 after ARF.

METHODS: The labeling of <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> was performed using the superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/dextran complexed and not complexed to poly-L-lysine. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/dextran was incubated with poly-L-lysine in an ultrasonic sonicator at 37 °C for 10 minutes for complex formation superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine by electrostatic interaction. Then, the <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were incubated overnight with the complex superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/dextran. After the incubation period the <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were evaluated by internalization of the complex superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/dextran by Prussian Blue stain. Cellular viability of labeled <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> was evaluated by cellular proliferation assay using 5, 6 -carboxy-fluorescein-succinimidyl ester method and apoptosis detection by Annexin V- Propidium Iodide assay. RESULTS: <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/dextran without poly-L-lysine not internalized efficiently the superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles due to its low presence detected within <b>cells.</b> <b>Mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> labeled with the complex superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine efficiently internalized the superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles due to greater presence in the cells interior. The viability and apoptosis assays demonstrated that the <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> labeled and not labeled respectively with the superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine continue to proliferate over seven days and the percentage of cells in early or late apoptosis is low compared to the percentage of live cells over the three days.
