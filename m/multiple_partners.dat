5|$|Promiscuity, {{in which}} {{both males and females}} mate with <b>{{multiple}}</b> <b>partners,</b> also occurs in rodents. In species such as the white-footed mouse, females give birth to litters with multiple paternities. Promiscuity leads to increased sperm competition and males tend to have larger testicles. In the Cape ground squirrel, the male's testes can be 20 percent of its head-body length. Several rodent species have flexible mating systems that can vary between monogamy, polygyny and promiscuity.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} mating systems among teleosts. Some species are promiscuous, where {{both males and}} females breed with <b>multiple</b> <b>partners</b> and there are no obvious mate choices. This has been recorded in Baltic herring, guppies, Nassau groupers, humbug damselfish, cichlids and creole wrasses. Polygamy, where one sex has <b>multiple</b> <b>partners</b> can come in many forms. Polyandry consists of one adult female breeding with multiple males, which only breed with that female. This is rare among teleosts, and fish in general, but is found in the clownfish. In addition, it may also exist to an extent among anglerfish, where some females have more than one male attached to them. Polygyny, where one male breeds with multiple females, is much more common. This is recorded in sculpins, sunfish, darters, damselfish and cichlids where multiple females may visit a territorial male that guards and takes care of eggs and young. Polygyny may also involve a male guarding a harem of several females. This occurs in coral reef species, such as damselfishes, wrasses, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and tilefishes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{the extent and}} correlates of <b>multiple</b> <b>partner</b> fertility among parents in the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Survey {{in order to assess}} the opportunities and challenges that await marriage promotion policies which are attracting the attention of policy makers. We find that the majority of mothers who responded to the baseline and 12 -month follow-up surveys are not first time mothers and the majority of mothers with two or more children have had at least one child with someone other than the father of their newborn. According to mothers' reports, fathers are equally likely to exhibit <b>multiple</b> <b>partner</b> fertility. While the descriptive analysis cannot speak to causation, our results are certainly consistent with the hypothesis that <b>multiple</b> <b>partner</b> fertility reduces the probability of marriage for mothers and fathers. <b>Multiple</b> <b>partner</b> fertility is rare among teenaged mothers, but fairly high among African American mothers and fathers, which may help to explain the low-marriage probabilities. Our results suggest that marriage promotion strategies will have their greatest opportunity among unwed mothers in their early twenties and the fathers of their children, but high rates of <b>multiple</b> <b>partner</b> fertility are expected to reduce the effective of such efforts among African Americans. ...|$|R

Hall was utilized mainly in a backup role throughout the next few months, teaming with Melina, as well as competing in a 12 wrestler tag team match at the Backlash pay-per-view in April, which her team won. In mid-2008, Hall began a scripted rivalry with Mickie James and Kelly Kelly, teaming up with <b>multiple</b> <b>partners,</b> including Layla and Katie Lea Burchill to face them in tag team matches. She continued to have a rivalry with Kelly throughout October, and was {{also a part of}} the winning team in a Raw versus SmackDown 10-wrestler tag team elimination match at Survivor Series in November, although she was eliminated by Maria.|$|E
5|$|Bats {{employ a}} number of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most species are polygynous, where males mate with multiple females. Male pipistrelle, noctule and vampire bats may claim and defend resources that attract females, such as roost sites, and mate with those females. Males that are unable to claim a site are forced {{to live on the}} periphery where they have less reproductive success. Promiscuity, where both sexes mate with <b>multiple</b> <b>partners,</b> exists in species like the Mexican free-tailed bat and the little brown bat. Nevertheless, there does appear to be bias towards certain males among females in these bats. In a few species, such as the yellow-winged bat and spectral bat, adult males and females form monogamous pairs. Lek mating, where males aggregate and compete for female choice though display, is rare in bats but notably occurs in the highly sexually dimorphic hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus).|$|E

Therefore, partner reduction is one of the prevention strategies to accomplish the Millenium development goal of halting and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS. In order to explore possible association between sexual partnering and some risk factors, this paper utilizes a novel Bayesian geoadditive latent variable model for count outcomes. This allows us to simultaneously analyze linear and nonlinear effects of covariates as well as spatial variations of one or more latent variables, such as attitude towards <b>multiple</b> <b>partnering,</b> which in turn directly influences the multivariate observable outcomes or indicators. Influence of demographic factors such as age, gender, locality, state of residence, educational attainment, etc., and knowledge about HIV/AIDS on attitude towards <b>multiple</b> <b>partnering</b> is also investigated. Results can provide insights to policy makers with the aim of reducing the spread of HIV and AIDS among the Nigerian populace through partner reduction. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: In Tanzania is {{now more}} than two decades since the first cases of AIDS were {{reported}} in 1983. HIV infection has rapidly spread throughout the country, affecting all sectors of the society. Most infections are transmitted through hetero-sexual intercourse. The motorcyclists have <b>multiple</b> sexual <b>partners</b> and rarely did not use condoms regularly during the sexual intercourse with their sexual partners not their spouses. Problem that lies ahead of the motorcyclist community is the practice of unsafe sex, which puts them at risk of HIV/AIDS. Objective: To explore the extent to which personal, client and sexual desire factors influence acquisition of <b>multiple</b> sexual <b>partners</b> among the motorcyclist in Kinondoni Municipality. Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted along Bagamoyo road in Kinondoni Municipality in June 2016. This study employed both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. A total of 480 motorcyclists from 20 motorcycle’s parking points were interviewed using a survey while an in-depth interview was used 10 respondents to get deeply information from the motorcyclists in their respective parking points. Results: Half of 480 motorcyclists interviewed (54. 2 %) reported to have had <b>multiple</b> sexual <b>partners</b> in the past 12 months prior the study. About 61. 7 % of the respondents did not use condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with a casual sexual partner. It was found that motorcyclist clients have a great influence on acquisition of <b>multiple</b> sexual <b>partners</b> among the motorcyclists. Also the client’s body’s shape and good responses from the clients have great influence on acquisition of <b>multiple</b> sexual <b>partners</b> among the motorcyclist. In additional, sexual desire seems tempting to influence acquisition of <b>multiple</b> sexual <b>partners</b> among the motorcyclists. The opinions from the motorcyclist are as follows; to avoid <b>multiple</b> sexual <b>partners</b> among the motorcyclist reported as 49. 4 said motorcyclists should avoid all kinds of influences from their clients, 40. 2 % said health education should be provided to the motorcyclists and 10. 4 % of the respondents said motorcyclists should engage in sports to avoid sexual influence. Conclusion: This study found that the majority of commercial motorcyclists have <b>multiple</b> sexual <b>partners.</b> Also majority of them did not use condoms regularly with casual partners. It was reported that the motorcyclist’s clients have great influence in the acquisition of <b>multiple</b> sexual <b>partners</b> among the motorcyclist. The study also reveals that sexual desire contributes to the acquisition of <b>multiple</b> sexual <b>partners</b> among the motorcyclists. Recommendations: Special efforts intervention such as health education should be done to the motorcyclists so that they can change their behaviour of having <b>multiple</b> sexual <b>partners.</b> The district government, Institutions, NGOs and other stakeholders should work together to make condoms are available and affordable, also to sensitizing and encourage the motorcyclists on the use of condoms regularly and consistently. Further research should be conducted to assess the sexual relationship between <b>multiple</b> sexual <b>partners</b> and their clients...|$|R
25|$|Both {{male and}} female D. melanogaster act polygamously (having {{multiple}} sexual partners at the same time). In both males and females, polygamy results in a decrease in evening activity compared to virgin flies, more so in males than females. Evening activity consists of the activities that the flies participate in other than mating and finding partners, such as finding food. The reproductive success {{of males and females}} varies, {{due to the fact that}} a female only needs to mate once to reach maximum fertility. Mating with <b>multiple</b> <b>partners</b> provides no advantage over mating with one partner, and therefore females exhibit no difference in evening activity between polygamous and monogamous individuals. For males, however, mating with <b>multiple</b> <b>partners</b> increases their reproductive success by increasing the genetic diversity of their offspring. This benefit of genetic diversity is an evolutionary advantage because it increases the chance that some of the offspring will have traits that increase their fitness in their environment.|$|E
25|$|Prolonged use {{of alcohol}} {{has been known to}} impair the nervous system, heart, liver and the {{reproductive}} organs resulting in reduced sexual abilities in adult males.

25|$|The {{difference}} in evening activity between polygamous and monogamous male flies {{can be explained}} with courtship. For polygamous flies, their reproductive success increases by having offspring with <b>multiple</b> <b>partners,</b> and therefore they spend more time and energy on courting multiple females. On the other hand, monogamous flies only court one female, and expend less energy doing so. While it requires more energy for male flies to court multiple females, the overall reproductive benefits it produces has kept polygamy as the preferred sexual choice.|$|E
25|$|In addition, a {{study on}} Chilean {{flamingos}} (Phoenicopterus chilensis) found that birds in a bond were much more aggressive than single birds. The paired birds {{were significantly more likely}} to start an agonistic encounter in defense of their mate or young whereas single birds were typically non-breeding and less likely to fight. Not all flamingos can mate in the population because of an unsuitable sex ratio or some dominant flamingos mating with <b>multiple</b> <b>partners.</b> Mates are a fiercely contested resource in many species as the production of offspring is essential for an individual to propagate its genes.|$|E

The effect of the multiple extinction treatment was present in tests carried out in presence of the original training cue (ABA design) {{as well as in the}} presence of a novel test cue (ABC design), suggesting the effect was mediated by the associative strength of the target cue, rather than by the strength of the partner cue.

25|$|Baumeister (2010) {{found that}} masochistic males {{experienced}} greater: severity of pain, frequency of humiliation (status-loss, degrading, oral), partner infidelity, active participation by other persons, and cross dressing. Trends {{also suggested that}} male masochism included more bondage and oral sex than female (though the data was not significant). Female masochists, on the other hand, experienced greater: frequency in pain, pain as punishment for 'misdeeds' in the relationship context, display humiliation, genital intercourse, and presence of non-participating audiences. The exclusiveness of dominant males in a heterosexual relationship should be noted because, historically, men in power preferred <b>multiple</b> <b>partners.</b> Finally, Baumeister (2010) observes a contrast between the 'intense sensation' focus of male masochism to a more 'meaning and emotion' centred female masochistic script.|$|E
25|$|Impulsive {{behavior}} is common, including substance or alcohol abuse, eating disorders, unprotected sex or indiscriminate sex with <b>multiple</b> <b>partners,</b> reckless spending, and reckless driving. Impulsive behavior may also include leaving jobs or relationships, running away, and self-injury. People with BPD act impulsively {{because it gives}} them the feeling of immediate relief from their emotional pain. However, in the long term, people with BPD suffer increased pain from the shame and guilt that follow such actions. A cycle often begins in which people with BPD feel emotional pain, engage in impulsive behavior to relieve that pain, feel shame and guilt over their actions, feel emotional pain from the shame and guilt, and then experience stronger urges to engage in impulsive behavior to relieve the new pain. As time goes on, impulsive behavior may become an automatic response to emotional pain.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, with no endemic malaria, the {{prevalence}} of sickle-cell anaemia among African Americans is lower (about 0.25%) than in West Africa (about 4.0%) and is falling. Without endemic malaria, the sickle-cell mutation is purely disadvantageous and tends to decline in the affected population by natural selection, and now artificially through prenatal genetic screening. However, the African American community descends from a significant admixture of several African and non-African ethnic groups and also represents the descendants of survivors of slavery and the slave trade. Thus, a lower degree of endogamy and, particularly, abnormally high health-selective pressure through slavery {{may be the most}} plausible explanations for the lower prevalence of sickle-cell anaemia (and, possibly, other genetic diseases) among African Americans compared to West Africans. Another factor that limits the spread of sickle-cell genes in North America is the absence of cultural proclivities to polygamy, which allows affected males to continue to seek unaffected children with <b>multiple</b> <b>partners.</b>|$|E
