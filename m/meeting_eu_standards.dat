40|$|This study {{examined}} the hypotheses that vehicles meeting EU safety standards perform similarly to US-­‐regulated vehicles in the US driving environment, and vice versa. The analyses used three statistical approaches to “triangulate” evidence regarding differences in crash and injury risk. Separate analyses assessed crash avoidance technologies, including headlamps and mirrors. The results suggest that when controlling for differences in environment and exposure, vehicles <b>meeting</b> <b>EU</b> <b>standards</b> offer reduced risk of serious injury in frontal/side crashes and have driver-­‐side mirrors that reduce risk in lane-­‐change crashes better, while vehicles meeting US standards provide a lower risk of injury in rollovers and have headlamps that make pedestrians more conspicuous...|$|E
40|$|Current {{trends in}} the {{enlargement}} process of the European Union offer a virtual laboratory through which to gain insight into the mechanics of constitutional change. In particular, the Central and Eastern European countries, including Romania and Serbia, serve as great lenses through which to view the processes involved in consolidating democracy through constitutional dynamics. Even though EU accession may offer a set of incentives to these and other recent candidate countries, pro-democracy constitutional change aimed at <b>meeting</b> <b>EU</b> <b>standards</b> still requires a push from domestic coalitions within national political systems. By establishing a comparative framework by which to examine domestic coalitions in case studies of Romania and Serbia, this thesis offers three claims regarding constitutional change toward democracy: Firstly, that countries enacting constitutional change from within existing, consolidating democratic systems are dependent on {{a core group of}} political elites forming a coalition and embracing the cause of constitutional reform. Second, that message framing and communication on intra-governmental and public levels makes a difference in the outcome of constitutional referendums, an issue that is especially relevant in countries looking to reform constitutions to align their governance with EU standards. And finally, that institutional openness to change is indispensible to countries looking to reform constitutions in line with the Copenhagen Criteria within existing, consolidating democratic systems...|$|E
40|$|The EU's import {{requirements}} for animals and animal products {{from third countries}} were explained in guidelines issued on June 23 rd 2003 by the European Commission. The aim of the guidelines is to facilitate trade (particularly with developing countries) by providing a simple guide to often complex regulations. They explain: the general principles behind the existing system for approval of third countries' exports of live animals and animal-products to the EU; the administrative procedures that are followed when a request for approval is received from the national authorities of a third country; information on the EU's animal-health, animal-welfare and food-safety requirements, including animal welfare at slaughter; details of contact points and other sources of information. The Commission maintains that the document should 'be of considerable assistance to third countries, especially developing countries, that wish to establish the regulatory requirements applying to imports to the EU. Comment: It {{should be noted that}} third countries exporting to the EU will be expected to have in place similar food-safety control plans as those required of EU member states. The Commission recognises that this may impose a heavy burden on developing countries in terms of verifying compliance. Against this background the Commission is proposing to extend assistance to developing countries in <b>meeting</b> <b>EU</b> <b>standards</b> and verifying compliance, particularly with regard to training and advice.

40|$|The EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy and the Development Commissioner Poul Nielson {{announced}} on February 10 th {{the establishment of}} a 'help desk' inside the Commission to assist developing country exporters to take advantage of preferential access to the EU market. The help desk is expected to become operational in the course of 2003, forming part of the European Commission's commitment to making trade work for development. The announcement of the help-desk initiative accompanied the launch of a publication setting out case reports on EU trade development projects around the world This brochure contains eleven case reports including seven from ACP countries. These include: a project for capacity building for trade negotiations in Namibia; support for the revitalisation of vanilla production in Madagascar; a black economic-empowerment project in South Africa; a trade-development project in Jamaica; an export-development programme in Zambia; support to <b>meeting</b> <b>EU</b> <b>standards</b> in Senegal; assistance in meeting EU hygiene standards in the fisheries sector in Cape Verde. The case reports are simply illustrative of the 117 trade-related projects supported by the EU over the period from 1996 to 2001, to which € 640 million in assistance was extended. 61 % of these projects were in ACP countries. Comment: While recognising the valuable contribution these individual projects can make to the development of trade in individual sectors in individual ACP countries, it needs to be borne in mind that the assistance extended to ACP states over the period from 1996 to 2001 amounts to less than 3. 5 % of the development assistance funds made available to ACP countries under the 8 th EDF and represents only slightly over € 1 million per ACP country per annum over the period. The total amount devoted to trade development in ACP countries since 1996 is equivalent to only 80 % of the income loss which ACP sugar exporters will suffer {{in the first two years}} after a 25 % reduction in the EU sugar price. According to the Commission's own figures under the 9 th EDF, of the NIP 'A' allocations so far programmed, only 0. 1 % of these funds have been allocated to trade-development projects and only 1. 1 % has been allocated to agricultural development projects.

40|$|A USDA {{analysis}} of the EBA initiative {{has found that the}} trade deficit of least developed countries with the EU has grown {{over the past five years}} and is larger than their trade deficit with the USA. The paper notes that the aim of the EBA initiative was to boost the trade of least developed countries in order to diversify their economies. In fact EU agricultural imports from LDCs have been decreasing over the past five years, with the LDC trade deficit with the EU reaching a new high in 2002. The paper points out that the EU is a net agricultural exporter to LDCs, with milk powder and wheat dominating. According to this report there is no evidence to suggest that imports to the EU have increased due to the EBA. The paper cites a World Bank study by Paul Bretton which suggest a number of reasons for the limited impact of the EBA initiative, notably: Rules of origin which are far stricter than those obtaining in the Cotonou Agreement; Restrictive requirements for meeting the 'sufficient processing' criteria; The costs and difficulties of providing the necessary paper work. Additional reasons put forward in the paper for the relative failure of the EBA include: Recognition of the possibility of the withdrawal of these preferences, since they are unilaterally established and are not bound at the WTO; Rapidly changing EU standards (an example was cited of Mozambican prawns which met all EU standards at the point of departure but which were in violation of revised EU standards upon arrival at the EU port). While it is recognised that the EU is not the only country where SPS standards can pose a problem to LDC exporters, it argues that EU standards are particularly burdensome, since they increasingly go beyond the CODEX system. LDCs are seen as facing particular problems with SPS measures, since they face difficulties not only in <b>meeting</b> <b>EU</b> <b>standards</b> cost effectively but also in verifying compliance with these standards where they are met. The report cites a World Bank study by John Wilson which noted that 'a 10 % increase in EU food standards decreased African exports to the EU by 11 %'. The USDA report notes that EBA exports are dominated by raw materials (unroasted coffee, undecaffeinated coffee beans, raw cotton, unmanufactured tobacco and raw cane sugar), with EU manufacturers gaining the marketing margins through processing for sale in domestic and international markets (including markets in the very LDCS which exported the raw materials). Comment: The deteriorating trade deficit of LDCs vis-à-vis the EU could be accounted for by the fluctuations in the US$/ € exchange rate. Since most LCD exports are denominated in US dollars the euro value of exports would have fallen by around 20 % over the past two years as a result of currency movements. A dramatic annual increase in LDC exports to the EU would have been needed for this phenomenon not to have manifested itself in a nominal increase in the trade deficit of LDCs with the EU. This being said, the issues raised with regard to the implementation of the EBA do need to be addressed. This could be attempted through the ACP-EU dialogue framework (since most LDCs are ACP members) with non-ACP LDC participants being invited to attend the sessions at which LDC issues are discussed. Some LDCs have undoubtedly benefited from the EBA. Ethiopia for example has been able to open up sugar exports to the EU making sugar its fifth largest export to the EU in 2002. A USDA {{analysis of}} the EBA initiative has found that the trade deficit of least [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A {{conceptual}} framework was described for national identification and recording (I&R) systems, especially {{referring to the}} role in the control of highly contagious diseases in pigs. Subsequently, four different concepts of I&R systems were described: a current system <b>meeting</b> <b>EU</b> minimum <b>standards,</b> a revised system that will be introduced in several countries {{in the near future}} and two future concepts, based on electronic identification and monitoring. These concepts were discussed from the perspective of (1) their role in disease prevention and control, and (2) the impact of additional applications of these systems on animal production. It was concluded that improvement of the current I&R system can be beneficial to contagious disease control. Moreover, electronic identification and monitoring systems could be an especially important tool in improving collection and subsequent utilisation of information in future animal production. The additional applications would also be very valuable in increasing the economic feasibility of these systems. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Addressing Britain's National Farmers' Union, Commissioner Fischler {{highlighted}} how 90 % of EU citizens believe ensuring {{food safety}} and food hygiene is an important function of agricultural policy. It is against this background that the EU has been adopting 'a range of measures to make legislation even stricter'. However, Commissioner Fischler highlighted the need for EU member states to ensure the new regulations were strictly enforced. Comment: In the short term, ACP exporters of food products will need to invest not only in <b>meeting</b> <b>EU</b> regulatory <b>standards</b> but also in ensuring that the administrative arrangements for verification of compliance are efficient and comprehensive if new obstacles to ACP trade are not to emerge. In the medium term, ACP governments will need to launch {{a dialogue with the}} EU on how EU food safety concerns can be addressed without placing an undue economic burden on small scale ACP exporters, given the high fixed costs which compliance with SPS standards can impose.

40|$|THESIS 7678 EU {{legislation}} requires Ireland to set {{ambient air}} quality objectives, assess the {{ambient air quality}}, gather information on ambient air quality and make it available to the public, and to maintain or improve the ambient air quality. These ambient air quality objectives are specified in the Daughter Directives of the Air Quality Framework Directive (CEC, 1996; 1999; 2000; 2002). The Irish EPA considered that NO 2 and PM 10 would present the greatest challenges in <b>meeting</b> the <b>EU</b> <b>standards</b> and warned of the implications for traffic management and transport policy (EPA, 2000). ?Road traffic has replaced stationary combustion sources as the greatest threat? to air quality in Ireland, according to the EPA (2000). The transport sector is estimated to contribute 50 % of total NOx emissions and 80 % of total CO emissions in Ireland. Sources of PMio in Ireland are under investigation.

40|$|The European Union has {{recently}} implemented its Data Directive on Privacy, a legal measure stating that certain "personal " information (e. g., an individual's race, sexual orientation, or medical records) {{can not leave}} the EU unless {{it is going to}} a nation with privacy laws {{similar to those of the}} EU Directive. As the United States is not a member of the EU and as it has no official national data privacy legislation paralleling that of the EU, it cannot legally receive any form of “personal ” information from any of the EU’s 15 member states unless it first receives the consent of the individual. The United States responded with the "Safe Harbor Principles” which shift the burden of <b>meeting</b> <b>EU</b> privacy <b>standards</b> away from the national government and to individual companies. The Safe Harbor Principles, however, have not been well received by either the EU or the American companies they were designed to help.

40|$|Phase 1 of the Mutual Recognition Methodology Development (MRMD) project {{developed}} {{an approach to}} statistical modeling and analysis of field data to address the state of evidence relevant to mutual recognition of automotive safety regulations. Specifically, the report describes a methodology {{that can be used}} to measure evidence for the hypothesis that vehicles <b>meeting</b> <b>EU</b> safety <b>standards</b> would perform similarly to US-regulated vehicles in the US driving environment, and that vehicles meeting US safety standards would perform similarly to EU-regulated vehicles in the EU driving environment. As part of the project, we assessed the availability and contents of crash datasets from the US and the EU, as well as their collective ability to support the proposed statistical methodology. The report describes a set of three statistical approaches to “triangulate” evidence regarding similarity or differences in crash and injury risk associated with EU- and US-regulated vehicles. Approach 1, Seemingly Unrelated Regression, tests whether the models are identical and will also assess the capability of the data analysis to detect differences in the models, if differences exist. Approach 2, Consequences of Best Models, uses logistic regression to develop two separate models, one for EU risk and one for US risk, as a function of a set of predictors (i. e., crash, vehicle, and occupant conditions). The two models will then be exercised on a standard population for the <b>EU</b> and a <b>standard</b> population for the US. Approach 3, Evidence for Consequences, turns the question around to measures the overall evidence for each of a set of possible conclusions. Each conclusion is characterized by a range of relative risk on a single population. Evidence is measured using a weighted average of likelihoods for a large group of models that produce the same outcome. That evidence is then compared using Bayes Factors...|$|R

40|$|Croatia’s EU {{accession}} of July 2013 {{may have}} significant impacts on neibouring exporters such as Bosnia and Herzegovina.

This paper examines the negative effects of <b>EU</b> <b>standards</b> on trade flows between Croatia (then a non-EU member) and Slovenia (EU-accessing state) with particular reference to agricultural export from the former. The analysis implies that the <b>EU</b> <b>standards</b> duly discourage trade flows of non-compliant agricultural and food sectors. The implications to relatively agriculture-dependent Bosnia are significant in terms of possible unemployment and social stability. But in the medium and longer term, the effort to comply with the standards can pay, like Croatia...|$|R
