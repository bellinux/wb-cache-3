40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new methodology for online voltage stability assessment, {{consisting of two}} steps. Firstly, the time evolution of the power system operating state is modeled {{with the help of}} a forecasting-aided state estimator; secondly the voltage collapse point is determined through an extrapolation technique based on tangent vector behavior. Tests are carried out using the IEEE- 14 bus system, where different operating scenarios are considered. The results show that monitoring system load trends may improve the assessment of voltage stability. Keywords: Voltage collapse; Tangent vector; Power system monitoring; Forecasting-aided state estimation. 1. INTRODUCTION Voltage collapse problems have become a relevant concern during planning and operation of power systems, since serious consequences, like dynamic instability may arise [1]. Even though the phenomenon is recognized as a dynamic event, references [2, 3] show that, under certain considerations, a static system <b>model</b> <b>suf</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Rao-Blackwell theorem We {{expect that}} the {{following}} is well-known, but we state it here for convenience. Let (Ω; A; P) be an arbitrary probability space representing the experiment. The oe- algebra A embodies the observable information. Unless otherwise specified, random variables {{are assumed to be}} A-measurable. We assume P is known to belong to a class Θ of probability measures on(Ω; A). Denote the expectation with respect to P by E or E P. Further assume A is measure-complete with respect to every P 2 Θ. Definition 1 A oe-algebra B ` A is sufficient for Θ if the conditional expectation operator E P () does not depend on P 2 Θ, in the sense that there is an operator E() such that for any real r. v. T, E P (TjB) = E(TjB) (P -a. s.) for all P 2 Θ. The concept of a sufficient oe-algebra was apparently introduced by Halmos & Savage [23] and Bahadur [4]. Sufficiency depends on Θ, i. e. on the underlying probability <b>model.</b> A <b>suf</b> [...] ...|$|R
