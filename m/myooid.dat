40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to {{engineer}} three-dimensional skeletal muscle tissue constructs from primary cultures of adult rat myogenic precursor cells, and to measure their excitability and isometric contractile properties. The constructs, termed myooids, were muscle-like in appearance, excitability, and contractile function. The myooids were 12 mm long and ranged in diameter from 0. 1 to 1 mm. The myooids were engineered with synthetic tendons at each end to permit the measurement of isometric contractile properties. Within each <b>myooid</b> the myotubes and fibroblasts were supported by an extracellular matrix generated by the cells themselves, and did not require a preexisting scaffold to define the size, shape, and general mechanical properties of the resulting structure. Once formed, the myooids contracted spontaneously at approximately 1 Hz, with peak-to-peak force amplitudes ranging from 3 to 30 mN. When stimulated electrically the myooids contracted to produce force. The myooids (n 5 14) had the following mean values: diameter of 0. 49 mm, rheobase of 1. 0 V/mm...|$|E
40|$|A <b>myooid</b> is a {{three-dimensional}} skeletal muscle construct cultured from mammalian myoblasts and fibroblasts. The {{purpose was to}} compare over several weeks in culture the morphology, excitability, and contractility of myooids developed from neonatal and adult rat cells. The hypotheses tested were as follows: (1) baseline forces of myooids correlate with the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the myooids composed of fibroblasts, and (2) peak isometric tetanic forces normalized by total CSA (specific Po) of neonatal and adult rat myooids are not different. Electrical field stimulation {{was used to measure}} the excitability and peak tetanic forces. The proportion of the CSA composed of fibroblasts was greater for neonatal (40 %) than adult (17 %) myooids. For all myooids the baseline passive force normalized by fibroblast CSA (mean = 5. 5 kPa) correlated with the fibroblast CSA (r 2 = 0. 74). A two-element cylindrical model was analyzed to determine the contributions of fibroblasts and myotubes to the baseline force. At each measurement period, the specific Po of the adult myooids was greater than that of the neonatal myooids. The specific Po of the adult myooids was ~ 1 % of the control value for adult muscles and did not change with time in culture, while that of neonatal myooids increased...|$|E
40|$|Tendons are {{essentially}} parallel fibers of collagen, ~ 70 % {{of the dry}} weight, interspersed with fibroblasts {{that are responsible for}} the development and maintenance of tendon physiology. Tissue engineering of collagen structures involves the interaction of cellular and collagen mechanics and growth, providing a challenge to tendon development models. Our attempts to elucidate these interactions are based on the alignment of collagen either by physiological or mechanical means. Tendon fibroblasts in culture attempt to align isotropic collagen gels, constrained only by cross-links, and when grown alone will spontaneously form macroscopic tendon-like structures that are under cell-mediated tension. 1, 2 We are currently reproducing these results with fibroblasts obtained from rat Achilles tendon to generate aligned collagenous structures. Aligned collagen gels may also be formed by creating a double network. 3 The collagen network is allowed to partially crosslink under an imposed deformation, it is then placed under additional deformation during further crosslinking. The overall goal in creating these tendon structures is to combine them with self-assembling 3 -dimensional muscle constructs, termed myooids, that have already been created in our lab. 4 These myooids generate force spontaneously and upon the application of an electrical stimulus. Unfortunately, this force is on the scale of developing muscle, a result of a physiology that resembles muscles of embryonic and neonatal mammals. It is well known that mechanical stimuli are an important factor in muscle and tendon development. The anchors currently used with the <b>myooid</b> do not form a strong interface with the muscle and do not allow for the application of cyclic mechanical strength of physiological intensity. The most suitable anchor for muscle is tendon. We will next explore the bioengineering of myotendonous junctions along with a quantitative description of their mechanical function...|$|E
