40|$|Cattle {{production}} faces {{new challenges}} regarding sustainability with its three pillars – economic, societal and environmental. The following three main factors will drive dairy cattle selection in the future: (1) During a long period, intensive selection for enhanced productivity has deteriorated most functional traits, some reaching {{a critical point}} and needing to be restored. This is especially {{the case for the}} Holstein breed and for female fertility, mastitis resistance, longevity and metabolic diseases. (2) Genomic selection offers two new opportunities: as the potential genetic gain can be almost doubled, more traits can be efficiently selected; phenotype recording can be decoupled from selection and limited to several thousand animals. (3) Additional information from other traits can be used, either from existing traditional recording systems at the farm level or from the recent and rapid development of new technologies and precision farming. Milk composition (i. e. mainly fatty acids) should be adapted to better meet human nutritional requirements. Fatty acids can be measured through a new interpretation of the usual medium infrared spectra. Milk composition can also provide additional information about reproduction and health. Modern <b>milk</b> <b>recorders</b> also provide new information, that is, on milking speed or on the shape of milking curves. Electronic devices measuring physiological or activity parameters can predict physiological status like estrus or diseases, and can record behavioral traits. Slaughterhouse data may permit effective selection on carcass traits. Efficient observatories should be set up for early detection of new emerging genetic defects. In the near future, social acceptance of cattle production could depend on its capacity to decrease its ecological footprint. The first solution consists in increasing survival and longevity to reduce replacement needs and the number of nonproductive animals. At the individual level, selection on rumen activity may lead to decreased methane production and concomitantly to improved feed efficiency. A major effort should be dedicated to this new field of research and particularly to rumen flora metagenomics. Low input in cattle production is very important and tomorrow's cow will need to adapt to a less intensive production environment, particularly lower feed quality and limited care. Finally, global climate change will increase pathogen pressure, thus more accurate predictors for disease resistance will be required...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the milk flow pattern in Italian Mediterranean Buffaloes in {{relation}} to parity and oxytocin administration. A total of 330 <b>milk</b> flow <b>recorders</b> were collected during morning and evening milkings by using an electronic milk flow meters (Lactocorder (R)). Milk flow curves were examined and subject were divided according milk flow pattern in: normal pattern, bimodal pattern and "double pattern". Data were analysed by using ANOVA and Chi square test. Total milk yield per milking was significantly higher (P< 0. 01) in pluriparous and consistent with the average DIM of 205 days. No differences in milk yield and maximum milk flow were found between the oxytocin groups while both parameters were higher in bimodal and double pattern groups compared to normal milk flow pattern. Lag time was higher (P< 0. 01) in oxytocin treated group and in normal vs the other two pattern groups. Length of main milking phase was higher in pluriparous, oxytocin treated group (P< 0. 01) and in bimodal vs the normal one (P< 0. 05) while double pattern showed the highest value (P< 0. 01). Percentage of bimodal milk flow was 13. 7 % while a double flow pattern was 12. 4 %. A higher percentage of double pattern was found in oxytocin treated buffaloes vs normal and bimodal ones (18. 1 % vs 8. 1 % and 7. 5 % respectively; P< 0. 05) and in pluriparous vs primiparous (74. 4 % vs 25. 6 %; P< 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} modern milking systems {{is the result}} of {{extensive}} field experience and trial and error. As milking systems become more complex, particularly in automated milking parlors, there is increasing need for engineering information for design and troubleshooting. There are several piping systems in a modern milking machine which must be sized to perform milking and CIP cleaning functions properly. The various piping systems must carry milk, air, or both while maintaining the proper vacuum levels to perform the milking function. The flow paths of milk and air for typical pipeline and <b>recorder</b> <b>milking</b> systems are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. The piping systems which may be found in milking machines and their functions are: In pipeline systems- those systems without recorder (weigh) jars Milklines transport milk and air from the milking unit to the receiver in pipeline systems. Milklines supply milking vacuum to the claw. Steady air flow unobstructed by undersized lines or slugs of milk will produce a reasonably stable milking vacuum supply throughout the milkline system. In recorder systems- those systems with recorder (weigh) jar...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of grazing versus zero-grazing on energy expenditure (EE), feeding behaviour and physical activity in dairy cows at different stages of lactation. Fourteen Holstein cows were subjected to two treatments in a repeated crossover design with three experimental series (S 1, S 2, and S 3) reflecting increased days in milk (DIM). At the beginning of each series, cows were on average at 38, 94 and 171 (standard deviation (SD) 10. 8) DIM, respectively. Each series consisted of two periods containing a 7 -d adaptation and a 7 -d collection period each. Cows either grazed on pasture for 16 – 18. 5  h per day or were kept in a freestall barn and had ad libitum access to herbage harvested from the same paddock. Herbage intake was estimated using the double alkane technique. On each day of the collection period, EE of one cow in the barn and of one cow on pasture was determined for 6  h by using the 13 C bicarbonate dilution technique, with blood sample collection done either manually in the barn or using an automatic sampling system on pasture. Furthermore, during each collection period physical activity and feeding behaviour of cows were recorded over 3  d using pedometers and behaviour <b>recorders.</b> <b>Milk</b> yield decreased with increasing DIM (P< 0. 001) but was similar with both treatments. Herbage intake was lower (P< 0. 01) for grazing cows (16. 8  kg dry matter (DM) /d) compared to zero-grazing cows (18. 9  kg DM/d). The lowest (P< 0. 001) intake was observed in S 1 and similar intakes were observed in S 2 and S 3. Within the 6 -h measurement period, grazing cows expended 19 % more (P< 0. 001) energy (319 versus 269  kJ/kg metabolic body size (BW 0. 75)) than zero-grazing cows and differences in EE did not change with increasing DIM. Grazing cows spent proportionally more (P< 0. 001) time walking and less time standing (P< 0. 001) and lying (P< 0. 05) than zero-grazing cows. The proportion of time spent eating was greater (P< 0. 001) and that of time spent ruminating was lower (P< 0. 05) for grazing cows compared to zero-grazing cows. In conclusion, lower feed intake along with the unchanged milk production indicates that grazing cows mobilized body reserves to cover additional energy requirements which were at least partly caused by more physical activity. However, changes in cows׳ behaviour between the considered time points during lactation were too small so that differences in EE remained similar between treatments with increasing DIM...|$|R
