Damon is also a spokesperson for Feeding America, a hunger-relief organization, and a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Entertainment Council, participating in their Ad Council public service announcements.

5|$|Linguist Jesse Sheidlower {{traces the}} gesture's {{development}} in the United States to the 1890s. According to anthropologist Desmond Morris, the gesture probably came to the United States via Italian immigrants. The first documented appearance of the finger in the United States was in 1886, when Old Hoss Radbourn, a baseball pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters, was photographed giving it to a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> rival the New York Giants. In the film Speedy (1928), Harold Lloyd's character gives himself the finger into a distorting mirror at Luna Park, about 24 minutes into the film.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the {{starship}} USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far {{from the rest of}} the Federation. In this episode, Voyager encounters a swarm of space-borne lifeforms, which mistake the vessel for a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> species. The presence of the aliens induce a premature mating cycle in Kes (Jennifer Lien), causing her and Neelix (Ethan Phillips) to question whether or not they are ready to have children.|$|E
25|$|Stake {{presidents are}} {{permitted}} to request records of past discipline <b>of</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> stake {{from the office of}} the First Presidency. Bishops may request records of past discipline <b>of</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> ward.|$|R
50|$|Whips act in an {{administrative}} role, making sure <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> party {{are in the}} debating chamber when required and organising <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> party to speak during debates. Since the introduction of proportional representation in 1996, divisions which require all members in the chamber to vote by taking sides (termed a personal vote) are rarely used, except for conscience issues. Instead, one of the party's whips votes on behalf <b>of</b> all the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> party, by declaring how many members are in favour and/or how many members are opposed. They also cast proxy votes for single-member parties whose member {{is not in the}} chamber {{at the time of the}} vote, and also cast proxy vote during personal votes for absent <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> parties and for absent <b>members</b> <b>of</b> associated single-member parties.|$|R

5|$|In fall 2014, Columbia University's student {{population}} was 29,870 (8,559 students in undergraduate programs and 21,311 in postgraduate programs), with 39% of the {{student population}} identifying themselves as a minority and 28% born outside of the United States. Twenty-six percent of students at Columbia have family incomes below $60,000, {{making it one of the}} most socioeconomically diverse top-tier colleges. Sixteen percent of students at Columbia receive Federal Pell Grants, which mostly go to students whose family incomes are below $40,000. Fifteen percent of students are the first <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> family to attend a four-year college.|$|E
5|$|Slavery {{existed in}} China since ancient times, {{although}} during the Han dynasty {{the proportion of}} slaves to the overall population was roughly 1%, far lower than the estimate for the contemporary Greco-Roman world (estimated at about 15% of the entire population). During the Tang period slaves {{were not allowed to}} marry a commoner's daughter, were not allowed to have sexual relations with any female <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> master's family, and although fornication with female slaves was forbidden in the Tang code of law it was widely practiced. Manumission was also permitted when a slave woman gave birth to her master's son, which allowed for her elevation to the legal status of a commoner, yet she could only live as a concubine and not as the wife of her former master.|$|E
5|$|The American Samoa {{team were}} troubled by {{passport}} issues, {{with only one}} <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> original 20-man senior team, goalkeeper Nicky Salapu, eligible to play. Some hint that the passport issue was an Australian ploy to win the match by a large margin {{in order to secure}} the team's move to the AFC. American Samoa were also unable to call their under-20 players because most of them were involved in high school exams at the time. They were forced to draft in their youth players, including three 15-year-old players, to put together a makeshift team with an average age of 18. According to team manager and Football Federation American Samoa vice-president Tony Langkilde, some of the Samoan players had never played a full 90-minute game before the match with Australia.|$|E

25|$|The {{most basic}} {{definition}} of linguistic rights {{is the right}} of individuals to use their language with other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> linguistic group, regardless of the status <b>of</b> <b>their</b> language. They evolve from general human rights, in particular: non-discrimination, freedom of expression, right to private life, and the right <b>of</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> a linguistic minority to use their language with other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> community.|$|R
30|$|Unlike the FE and the SRE, {{we include}} the {{material}} payoffs <b>of</b> the other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> {{the group of}} each player in the utility function.

5|$|The {{reformed}} legislative council, {{introduced in}} 1921 by the British, {{was based on}} principles of communal representation, which led the Tamils {{to realize that they}} were the minority ethnic group and that they should be represented by a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own community. It was under this communal representation that Tamil national awareness changed to national consciousness—a less passive state. They formed a Tamil political party called the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC). In the years leading to Sri Lankan independence, political tension began to develop between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities as the ACTC, citing the possibility of the majority Sinhalese adopting a dominant posture, pushed for “fifty-fifty” representation in parliament. This policy would allot half the seats in parliament to the Sinhalese majority and half to the minority communities: Ceylon Tamils, Indian Tamils, Muslims and others.|$|E
5|$|To the Stars is {{a science}} fiction novel by L. Ron Hubbard. The novel's story {{is set in a}} dystopian future, and chronicles the {{experiences}} of protagonist Alan Corday aboard a starship called the Hound of Heaven as he copes with the travails of time dilation from traveling at near light speed. Corday is kidnapped by the ship's captain and forced to become a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> crew, and when he next returns to Earth his fiancee has aged and barely remembers him. He becomes accustomed to life aboard the ship, and when the captain dies Corday assumes command.|$|E
5|$|Before 2009, members {{received}} the same salary as members of their national parliament. However, from 2009 a new members statute came into force, after years of attempts, which gave all members an equal monthly pay, of 8,020.53 euro each in 2014, subject to a European Union tax and which can also be taxed nationally. MEPs {{are entitled to a}} pension, paid by Parliament, from the age of 63. Members are also entitled to allowances for office costs and subsistence, and travelling expenses, based on actual cost. Besides their pay, members are granted a number of privileges and immunities. To ensure their free movement to and from the Parliament, they are accorded by their own states the facilities accorded to senior officials travelling abroad and, by other state governments, the status of visiting foreign representatives. When in their own state, they have all the immunities accorded to national parliamentarians, and, in other states, they have immunity from detention and legal proceedings. However, immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found committing a criminal offence and the Parliament also has the right to strip a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> immunity.|$|E

5|$|If a cat so chooses, {{they can}} take a {{different}} calling in life {{as that of a}} medicine cat. Medicine cats, unlike warriors, serve for their clan not through bloodshed, but through peace. They are trained to heal their Clanmates by using the natural resources as medicines; for example, cobwebs can be used to stitch deep wounds, whilst poppy seeds are used to lull a distressed cat into sleep. They sleep separately, surrounded by the herbs and resources they need to keep their Clan safe and healthy. Medicine cat apprentices go through a longer period of training than warriors, due to the vast amount of knowledge they must remember. Medicine cats are also not allowed to take any mates or have any kits. This is because they must care for each <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Clan equally; if they were to form a loving relationship with any one individual, they may unfairly place that cat’s life over that of the Clan. A Clan tends to have only one or two, and occasionally three, medicine cats at any given time.|$|E
5|$|While Marlborough {{fought in}} the Low Countries a series of {{personal}} and party rivalries instigated a general reversal of fortune. The Whigs, who were the main prop of the war, had been laying siege to Godolphin. As a price for supporting {{the government in the}} next parliamentary session, the Whigs demanded a share of public office with the appointment of a leading <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Junto, the Earl of Sunderland (Marlborough's son-in-law), to the post of Secretary of State. The Queen, who loathed Sunderland and the Junto, and who refused to be dominated by any single party, bitterly opposed the move; but Godolphin, increasingly dependent on Whig support, had little room for manoeuvre. With Sarah's tactless, unsubtle backing, Godolphin relentlessly pressed the Queen to submit to Whig demands. In despair, Anne finally relented and Sunderland received the seals of office; but the special relationship between Godolphin, Sarah, and the Queen had taken a severe blow and she began to turn increasingly to a new favourite – Sarah's cousin, Abigail Masham. Anne also became ever more reliant on the advice of Harley, who, convinced that the duumvirate's policy of appeasing the Whig Junto was unnecessary, had set himself up as alternative source of advice to a sympathetic Queen.|$|E
