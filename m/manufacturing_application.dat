The Core Manufacturing Simulation Data (CMSD) specification was created to foster the more widespread use of manufacturing simulation technology through the reduction of data interoperability issues. CMSD is a standardized, computer-interpretable representation that allows for the efficient exchange of manufacturing shop-floor-related data in a manner that it can be used to create and execute manufacturing simulations. CMSD was standardized under the auspices of the international Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO). It defines an information model that describes the characteristics of and relationships between the core manufacturing entities that define shop floor operations. This enables greater integration and data exchange possibilities for manufacturing simulations and other <b>manufacturing</b> <b>applications.</b> This paper presents an overview of CMSD, its motivation, structure, and content.

40|$|The {{problematic}} {{issues in}} the development of manufacturing software systems are related to the various nature of manufacturing systems, which are wide, dynamic and complex. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a solution by using framework-based software engineering to solve these problems. Framework-based software engineering is the idea of constructing software systems based on the integration of reusable components rather than developing software from scratch. The <b>manufacturing</b> <b>application</b> framework proposed in this paper is to be developed as a set of integrated reusable components, which can be adapted to suit specific manufacturing applications. This paper focuses on two subdomains of the manufacturing domain, i. e., Production Management (PM) and Statistical Quality Control (SQC). A generic model is defined based on the structure and behavior of each of the PM and SQC subdomains, from which the design infrastructure of the application framework is derived, based on the concept of design pattern. The details of the application framework development by integrating objectoriented technology and component-based development to achieve large-scale software reuse for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>application</b> develop-ment projects are also discussed...|$|E
