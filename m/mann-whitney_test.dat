50|$|To model binary Likert {{responses}} directly, {{they may}} be represented in a binomial form by summing agree and disagree responses separately. The chi-squared, Cochran's Q test, or McNemar test are common statistical procedures used after this transformation. Non-parametric tests such as chi-squared test, <b>Mann-Whitney</b> <b>test,</b> Wilcoxon signed-rank test, or Kruskal-Wallis test. are often used {{in the analysis of}} Likert scale data.|$|E
50|$|Skewness risk {{plays an}} {{important}} role in hypothesis testing. The analysis of variance, the most common test used in hypothesis testing, assumes that the data is normally distributed. If the variables tested are not normally distributed because they are too skewed, the test cannot be used. Instead, nonparametric tests can be used, such as the <b>Mann-Whitney</b> <b>test</b> for unpaired situation or the sign test for paired situation.|$|E

30|$|Characteristics of {{patients}} {{were described as}} count (percent) or median [interquartile range, IQR] for qualitative and quantitative variables, respectively, and were compared between groups using Chi-square or <b>Mann–Whitney</b> <b>tests,</b> as appropriate.|$|R
30|$|Statistical {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} using SPSS 17.0 software. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).

50|$|Robustness: As it {{compares the}} sums of ranks, the <b>Mann-Whitney</b> U <b>test</b> {{is less likely}} than the t-test to spuriously {{indicate}} significance {{because of the presence}} of outliers i.e., the <b>Mann-Whitney</b> U <b>test</b> is more robust.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} statistical significance of our results, a non-parametric inferential statistical method known as the <b>Mann-Whitney</b> <b>test</b> was used [57], which assesses whether observed samples are drawn from a single population (i.e., the null hypothesis).
