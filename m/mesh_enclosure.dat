40|$|Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) exhibit maladaptive {{behaviour}} when stocked into natural streams following {{one generation}} in a hatchery setting, reducing post-stocking survival. These behavioural patterns are commonly attributed to ‘hatchery selection’, where maladaptive phenotypes {{arise from the}} inadvertent selection of behavioural traits, lack of experience caused by captivity, {{or a combination of}} both. ‘Life skills training’, in which hatchery-reared fish are conditioned to exhibit appropriate behaviour responses, may increase post-stocking survival. A semi-natural field experiment, using in-situ <b>mesh</b> <b>enclosures,</b> compared wild-caught juvenile salmon to hatchery-reared counterparts from the same population. Fish were observed for antipredator, foraging, and territorial defense responses. Results showed no significant differences between wild and hatchery raised fish, although behaviour was significantly different between years. Overall, week long trials were insufficient in separating significant differences between strains, indicating one generation in captivity may not create major behavioural separation between wild and hatchery fish from the same population, or that more than one week is required for differences to become apparent. Behavioural response training protocols are suggested for hatchery raised experientially deprived fish destined for stocking...|$|R

40|$|Territoriality {{is thought}} to play an {{important}} role in the population regulation of animals. Consequently, the factors that affect territory size will also affect the number of individuals that can settle in a particular habitat. The prior-resident-advantage hypothesis predicts that territories will be smaller and more numerous in areas where individuals arrive synchronously rather than asynchronously, due to the dominance of residents over newcomers. I tested this prediction in a laboratory study with juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Although there was some evidence that early arrivers were more aggressive than late arrivers, there was no strong evidence that settlement pattern has an effect on the number and size of territories. In juvenile salmonid fishes, individual growth rate typically decreases with increasing density in observational field studies and territory size typically decreases with density in experimental laboratory studies. The validity of these studies has been questioned, because cause and effect cannot be inferred from the field studies and experimental laboratory studies are often unrealistic. To address the shortcomings of both approaches, I performed a field-based experiment using juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) at Catamaran Brook, New Brunswick. I manipulated the density of salmon in <b>mesh</b> <b>enclosures,</b> while measuring the growth rate and territory size of the salmon. As predicted, both growth rate and territory size decreased with increasing density, providing strong support for previous studie...|$|R
50|$|The Veterinary School Hospital Block {{is located}} {{to the west}} of the Veterinary School Main Building and its L-shaped plan completes a large grassed {{courtyard}} between the two. The hospital block is long and narrow with small stalls for animals along the western range, a two-level, brick fodder store in the south-western corner, a series of work rooms by the yard entrance on the north-west, further work rooms in the southern range terminating to the east with a blacksmith's room with forge and chimney. It combines glazed brickwork (the same as in the Veterinary School Main Building adjacent) and timber construction with a hipped roof over the fodder store and skillion roofs elsewhere; all clad with corrugated metal sheets. The interior walls of the animal stalls are painted brick with concrete floors. Enclosure on the yard side is by timber half-doors, steel mesh, and fly screens. Small, high-level windows feature on the rear wall. A timber and <b>mesh</b> <b>enclosure</b> runs along the front of the animal stalls and a concrete apron with drain extends into the courtyard. The workrooms and blacksmith's room have timber double-hung sash windows and ceilings of jointed boarding. The forge is sheeted over internally.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{validation}} of a measurement method for determining the magnetic shielding effectiveness of a wire <b>mesh</b> <b>enclosure</b> in the frequency range from 10 kHz to 150 kHz. The comparison with an analytical model (parallel-plate-shield, see Kaden, 1959) for magnetic shielding effectiveness of wire mesh {{is also part of}} this contribution. To measure the shielding effectiveness of an enclosure in general, two steps are necessary: 1. Reference measurement of the incident electro-magnetic field. 2. Measurement of the incident electro-magnetic field in the enclosure by same conditions. This method presented in the contribution uses a Helmholtz coil as magnetic field source, controlled by a signal generator and an amplifier in voltage mode. At first, a field meter was used to measure the frequency dependent magnetic field {{in the center of the}} Helmholtz coil. The magnetic field strength was also analytically calculated and compared to the measurement results. The next step was to measure the induction voltage caused by the magnetic field with a magnetic field probe, which was later used for the measurements of the shielding effectiveness either. A signal amplifier was needed to raise the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The gain of the signal amplifier was also determined and measured. Two positions of the enclosure in the Helmholtz coil were considered, horizontal and vertical. The vertical position of the enclosure approaches the analytical model of Kaden (1959) closely and the results show a good match with the analytical model...|$|E
40|$|Temperature ranges between day {{and night}} in {{southern}} California can be as great as 30 °C and may influence vital functioning of ectothermic organisms. Arachnids produce silks {{from a pair of}} spinnerets in their abdomen and rely on variance in protein composition to make different types of silks. Temperature may influence tensile strength of filaments. We tested the effects of temperature on tensile strength of dragline silk of five specimens of Araneus gemmoides (orb-weaver) which were collected from Malibu Creek State Park in the Santa Monica Mountains of southern California, under five temperature conditions. Each specimen was placed in a 0. 0283 m 3 <b>mesh</b> <b>enclosure</b> and allowed 24 - hours to acclimate to a temperature increase of 5 °C. Photoperiods were set at 12 -hour intervals for light and dark to simulate natural conditions. We then removed a single thread of dragline silk and measured tensile strength using an mechanical testing device (Instron 5544 -A). We found that dragline silk is typically composed of two monofilaments wrapped together at points and thus quantified transverse area of both monofilaments. This structure may explain the reason why variability around mean values was similar for the plot of stress at break versus temperature. After running a one way ANOVA statistical analysis for repeated measures, we found that at 10 °C both the Young’s Modulus and stress at break were significantly greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) than values obtained at 15 °C. Additionally, mass of spider seems to correlate with greater tensile strength (R 2 = 0. 52) suggesting that larger spiders produce stronger silk. Currently, biomaterial engineers are attempting to exploit the incredible properties of silk for production of fiber materials. Therefore, understanding how Araneus gemmoides is influenced by temperature offers insight into the optimal temperature for harvesting silk...|$|E

Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, causes more deaths in the Americas than any other parasitic disease (1). T. cruzi is carried in the gut of bloodsucking triatomine insects (Hemiptera, Reduviidae), and the parasite is usually transmitted to humans when the vector’s feces enter the host through the insect bite or mucous membranes (2). Triatoma infestans is the principal vector of T. cruzi in the southern cone of South America and the sole vector in southern Peru.

40|$|An {{increase}} in habitat complexity {{is thought to}} decrease visibility and the territory size of visually-oriented animals. Hence, the addition of physical structure has been viewed as a restoration technique, particularly in streams, to increase the density of target species. However, a decrease in territory size may {{have a negative effect}} on the fitness of individual organisms. This project is a first attempt to evaluate the effects of habitat structure on the behaviour and growth rate of wild young-of-the-year (YOY) Atlantic salmon. Fish were exposed to one of two habitat treatments in <b>mesh</b> <b>enclosures</b> in Catamaran Brook, New Brunswick: a fine gravel substrate (low complexity) or a fine gravel substrate with boulders added (high complexity). Wild-caught individuals were tagged, weighed and measured before being stocked at densities of 1 m 2 for seven day trials. Fish from high complexity environments exhibited a decrease in foraging rate, frequency of aggression, territory size compared to their counterparts from low complexity environments. Specific growth rate, however, did not differ significantly between treatments. While the addition of structure to a habitat may be beneficial at the population level in terms of an {{increase in}} population density, our results suggest that individual fish may pay a cost in terms of a decrease in foraging rate and territory size in these environments. Further research is needed to evaluate the costs and benefits of adding structure to improve the habitat quality for stream salmonids. ...|$|R

5|$|As well as {{the wild}} stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and non-food {{products}} were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species {{of plants and animals}} were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts, and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed farmed shellfish from the waste being produced by farmed salmon. Various methods are employed. <b>Mesh</b> <b>enclosures</b> for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|R
40|$|Abstract only availableHabitat {{loss and}} {{fragmentation}} {{are the primary}} causes in the declines of amphibian populations. Farming, urban sprawl, and logging have created a mosaic of developed and undeveloped land that may create barriers between aquatic breeding sites and terrestrial refuges. While ponds and wetlands are important in early development and breeding, many species spend their adult lives foraging in the terrestrial environment surrounding a breeding site. An amphibian's ability to move and forage in a terrestrial environment is determined by their capacity to remain hydrated. We compared desiccation rates of wood frogs (Rana sylvatica), green frogs (Rana clamitans), and American toads (Bufo americanus) juveniles in different microhabitats of a forest and a clear-cut to determine how they might affect the terrestrial activity of amphibians. Using the experimental arrays created by LEAP (Land use Effects on Amphibian Populations) at Daniel Boone Conservation Area we set up cylindrical wire <b>mesh</b> <b>enclosures</b> in forest drainages, forest ridges, brush piles in clear cuts, and open areas in clear cuts at two ponds. Animals {{were placed in the}} enclosures during the evening and weighed every six hours for twenty-four hours. Soil moisture, and soil temperature were also measured every six hours. Analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to compare percent water loss in the habitat treatments. All frogs lost water; however, water loss was greater in the day compared to night. Brush piles within the clear cut slowed water loss compared to open areas in the clear cuts, and animals on forest ridges lost more water than those in forest drainages. Our results reinforce the need to protect forest drainages as terrestrial refuges and illustrate that clear cutting, even with brush piles as cover, may negatively affect the delicate balance of mortality and survivorship in juveniles, therefore threatening the future of a population.

Small juvenile tiger prawns (3 - 6 mm in carapace length, CL) were stocked in enclosures at densities of 4 - 32 prawns per enclosure (4. 4 - 35. 5 prawns m - 2) on a high biomass seagrass bed (about 70 g m - 2 of mostly Enhalus acoroides) and one with low biomass (about 10 g m - 2 of mostly Halodule uninervis). After 2 - 3 weeks in the enclosures, recovery rates, and hence possibly survival, were greater on the high biomass Enhalus than on the low biomass Halodule. However, not all fish and crustaceans could be excluded from the enclosures. Growth rates were twice as fast on the high biomass Enhalus than on the low biomass Halodule. It {{is likely that the}} high biomass Enhalus, with its greater surface area, supported more epiphytic flora and fauna and reduced the potential for interference competition between prawns, compared with the low biomass Halodule. Growth rates on Enhalus were significantly faster at a stocking density of 4 prawns per enclosure (1. 3 mm CL week - 1) than at a stocking density of 16 and 32 prawns per enclosure (both 0. 8 mm CL week - 1), and did not differ significantly between April and October/November (temperatures were about 30 °C at both times). The mean growth rate at 8 prawns per enclosure (1. 1 mm CL week - 1) did not differ significantly from those at 4, 16 and 32 prawns per enclosure.

40|$|The laying-hen {{industry}} in the United States has been under pressure to change or modify the conventional housing systems. Traditionally, hens have been kept in conventional cages inside environmentally-controlled buildings. These cages are stacked wire <b>mesh</b> <b>enclosures</b> with mechanized egg collection, feed and water delivery systems. Over the past decade {{there has been much}} pressure to improve the welfare of the hens by replacing conventional cages with alternative housing systems. There are a number of alternative housing options under consideration or being used. In the cage free system the birds have access to the floor, but are limited to the inside of a barn. The aviary system monitored in this study is a subset of this cage-free system where a tiered structure is used to increase space allocation to the hen while accommodating more hens (than a single level barn). The aviary system also use mechanized egg collection, feed and water delivery systems similar to traditional barns. When the studies described in this dissertation were started, information on the aviary system seemed quite valuable, but the timeliness of the data has become even more apparent over the last few years. Where some states had previously been dealing with transitions to lower stocking densities (fewer hens per unit of area) or alternative systems, there is now an agreement on the table that may bring this transition to a national level. Because the aviary system is so different from conventional housing, there are questions about the impact and performance of such a system. The most obvious difference in all alternative housing, including aviaries, is the lower stocking density. With the lower stocking density, there are many questions about the correct management of houses, especially in winter. The potential issue with ventilation for indoor air quality at the lower stocking density is the possible need for supplemental heat and its proper distribution in the house. This dissertation looks at this issue from many different angles including ventilation rate, indoor air quality, heat and moisture production of the birds, fuel usage, and the birds 2 ̆ 7 preference for winter temperature-ammonia combinations. With the lower stocking density there is also a concern that the labor and utilities provided on a per bird basis will be higher. Another concern with the systems is that a portion of manure from the birds is held in the house on the floor as litter. The litter on the floor impacts indoor air quality. The ammonia and dust concentrations and emissions were two of the major concerns with regard to the litter. With the aviary system, the birds have the ability to be more active. There are questions about how this activity level impacts the heat and moisture production rates of these birds. Overall, there is very little information on the aviary system in the United States. This dissertation aims to address these questions and concerns...|$|R
40|$|The LWC is {{receiving}} a heavy loading of phosphorus from the River Thames. Mean inflow concentration is > 400 µg l- 1. The high nutrient loading is favouring dense growths of cyanobacteria, particularly Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. Blooms occurred in July and November 2005. A spring diatom bloom occurred in 2006 also, {{as a consequence}} of high densities of algae entering the system from the River Thames. It appears that nutrient recycling from the sediment is not {{a major part of the}} dynamics of the system to date; this may change. Macrophytes are not present in Reservoir Lagoon, but remain in Main Lake and Sheltered Lagoon. The more frequent occurrence of dense blooms in recent years is associated with an increasing fish biomass. There is a gradient of fish biomass across the LWC, highest in Reservoir Lagoon and lowest in Sheltered Lagoon. Fish appear to have removed larger benthic invertebrates and predatory zooplankton from the Reservoir Lagoon, and are now reliant upon zooplankton and chironomid prey. Fish predation on zooplankton enables the algal blooms to develop. Fish growth rate appears to have declined over time as densities have increased. Expected further increase in fish biomass will lead to further deterioration of the system. Lack of management action will result in deterioration of Reservoir Lagoon and Main Lake. Sheltered Lagoon appears to be stable and requires little management but, as it is at the hydraulic end of the system, will benefit from improvements upstream. To improve water quality in the LWC it will be necessary to manage both the supply of nutrients to the system and the fish populations. It is recommended that management take action to, 1. 	Reduce nutrient concentrations, particularly phosphorus, in the inflowing water by phosphorus stripping. This will reduce the potential for algal blooms and increase water clarity. 2. 	Reduce fish biomass in the Reservoir Lagoon. This will reduce predation on zooplankton and benthic invertebrates, and will result in improved water clarity and increased macrophyte growth. 3. 	Introduce piscivorous fish (preferably pike, Esox lucius) to Reservoir Lagoon, Main Lake and possibly Sheltered Lagoon. This will help control the fish populations. 4. 	Continue to monitor the system. It would be preferable to include Total Phosphorus (after digestion), Light Attenuance (measured in situ) and benthic invertebrates in the sampling programme. This will enable any improvements to be assessed and increase the understanding of the system. Actions 2 and 3 may potentially have a negative impact on piscivorous birds, but the overall improvement in the quality of the site will be beneficial to wildfowl and likely to provide more food for herbivorous and invertivorous birds. However, there is also the possibility that improvements in water clarity and macrophyte abundance will result in better hunting conditions for piscivorous birds.

Particle count data were collected;Needlepoint and wire ionizing electrodes were compared and no {{significant difference was found}} between dust decay rates. Because of the electrical shock hazard with high voltage electrodes, protective enclosures with and without forced air movement were investigated. Enclosure type affected the level of corona discharge and ion distribution. Ion distribution was controlled by the electric field forces rather than movement of the forced air. Therefore, a 58 % open plastic <b>mesh</b> protective <b>enclosure</b> was used. Area tube collectors with and without an insulating coating to reduce the shock hazard were also investigated. The coating reduced the dust removal rate by about 24 %;Prototype tests were conducted in an animal production unit to obtain a quantitative estimate of dust removal under typical operating conditions. Two animal chambers with similar ventilation, temperature control, and management were used. Each chamber housed 48 nursery pigs;Particle count and mass samples were collected. Particle size ranges collected were the same between the animal study and laboratory study [...] 0. 5 - 1. 0 micron, 1. 0 - 2. 0 micron, 2. 0 - 5. 0 micron, 5. 0 - 10. 0 micron, and greater than 10. 0 micron. Mass samples were taken with a 0. 8 micron filter and vacuum pump. All systems evaluated in this study resulted in a significant reduction in airborne dust concentration. Without ionization, typical particle counts were between 76 and 169 million particles per cubic meter (mppcm). With ionization dust control, particle counts were between 38 and 86 mppcm. Percent reductions of 57 % to 66 % of all dust particles were achieved with ionization. Comparing particle count and mass data indicates that particles greater than 2. 0 micron are removed more effectively than particles less than 2. 0 micron...|$|R
5000|$|Spearfishing with barbed {{harpoons}} {{along the}} sea coast was widespread by the Palaeolithic. Fish ponds surrounded Sumerian temples by 2&thinsp;500 BC and a Chinese classical text credited to the 5th-century BC businessman Fan Li is {{the earliest known}} work on fish farming. A surviving fragment of Isidore of Charax's 1st-century Parthian itinerary describes locals freediving for pearls in the Persian Gulf, and Oppian's 2nd-century Halieutics relates the four main Greek and Roman fishing methods as hook-and-line, netting, passive traps, and trident. Traditional fishing boats operate in near-shore waters but, during the late Middle Ages and early Modern period, fishing on the open sea—particularly cod—became important to the economic and naval development of Northern Europe, New England, and Canada. Overfishing along the coasts of the North Sea spurred the development of deep-sea fishers such as the Brixham and otter trawlers, which might serve as motherships for longlining dories; in the 19th century, advances such as rail transport, canning, and refrigeration allowed fishing to become a full-fledged industry. Improvements in sonar during the world wars were adapted as fishfinders and, during the 1950s, great factory ships caught and processed as many fish in an hour as earlier trawlers had in a season. By the 1960s, the North Atlantic and North Pacific fisheries were close to maximal exploitation. After the catch from wild marine fisheries grew from 18 million metric tons (20 million tons) in 1950 to around 85 million metric tons ( [...] million tons) by the late 1980s, it has remained essentially constant since. Chinese economic reform led to massive growth of its fishing production, from 7% of the world total in 1961 to 35% by 2010. Scientific studies of population dynamics and nationalization of formerly shared waters are both helping to cope with overexploitation but the success of modern commercial fishing has required major corrective actions: {{the collapse of the}} Grand Banks cod fishery to less than 1% of its historic levels required a complete moratorium by Canada in 1992 and China has enforced a zero-growth policy in its wild catch since 2000, redirecting its industry towards aquaculture; its annual months-long bans on fishing in disputed areas of the South China Sea is enforced over the protest of neighboring states.As of 2006, there were an estimated 43.5 million people involved in capturing or raising seafood, 85.5% of whom lived in Asia. About [...] were fishers and the remainder fish farmers. In 2012, total global production of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and other aquatic animals was a record 158 million metric tons (174 million tons), of which 91.3 million metric tons (100 million tons) were caught in the wild. This is also a record if ignoring the Peruvian anchovy, whose population can vary dramatically with the El Niño cycle. The overall trend remains increasing, but due to expanding aquaculture in inland waters and mariculture in the sea rather than higher catches in the wild. The exclusive economic zones around coastal countries under the UNCLOS regime have permitted states to institute quota and other management systems over the most productive regions of the sea, accounting for around 87% of the annual harvest. The results are sometimes dramatic—the lull in fishing {{over the course of the}} First World War saw the North Sea's 1919 catch double 1913's—and sometimes much less so: two decades on, the levels of cod in the Grand Banks remain only 10% of their peak. At present, the species most frequently landed are herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid, and salmon. A number of these, as well as large predatory fish, remain well below historical levels.Over 3 million vessels are employed in sea fishing. Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew, stern trawlers, purse seiners, long-line factory vessels, and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty.As well as the wild stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and non-food products were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species of plants and animals were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts, and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed farmed shellfish from the waste being produced by farmed salmon. Various methods are employed. <b>Mesh</b> <b>enclosures</b> for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|R
