2500|$|In general, jam is {{produced}} by taking mashed or chopped fruit or vegetable pulp and boiling it with sugar and water. The proportion of sugar and fruit varies according {{to the type of}} fruit and its ripeness, but a rough starting point is equal weights of each. When the mixture reaches a temperature of 104°C (219°F), the acid and the pectin in the fruit react with the sugar, and the jam will set on cooling. However, most cooks work by trial and error, bringing the <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> [...] "fast rolling boil", watching to see if the seething mass changes texture, and dropping small samples on a plate to see if they run or set.|$|E

50|$|To make {{ice cream}} in the United States during the eighteenth century, cooks and confectioners needed a “larger wooden bucket”, “a metal {{freezing}} pot with a cover, called a sorbetiere”, ice, salt, and the cream based mixture that they planned on freezing. The process starts with finding ice of a “manageable” size, then mixing it with salt and adding the <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bucket. Together, the ice and the salt create a refrigerating effect. The cook or confectioner adds their ice cream <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> freezing pot and then puts the cover on it. The freezing pot is put into the wooden bucket, where it is stirred and shaken to give the ice cream a creamy consistency. Occasionally, the freezing pot has to be opened, so that the frozen ice cream can {{be removed from the}} sides. The work was done by slaves and servants.|$|E

50|$|For high {{flow-rate}} applications, typically >15 MMSCFD, cryogenic processing is the norm. This is a {{distillation process}} which utilizes the different volatilities of methane (boiling point of −161.6 °C) and nitrogen (boiling point of −195.69 °C) to achieve separation. In this process, {{a system of}} compression and distillation columns drastically reduces {{the temperature of the}} gas <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> point where methane is liquified and the nitrogen is not. For smaller applications, a series of heat exchangers may be used as an alternative to distillation columns.|$|E
