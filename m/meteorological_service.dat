5|$|At 5a.m.AST (0900UTC) August 16 the {{respective}} governments of St. Lucia and Dominica issued hurricane warnings {{in anticipation of}} Hurricane Dean's imminent approach. In Dominica, a dozen and a half tourists were evacuated to concrete shelters. The government of Dominica also canceled leave for emergency service personnel and evacuated Princess Margret Hospital, fearing that its roof might be vulnerable to the storm's winds. At {{the same time the}} <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service</b> of Barbados issued a tropical storm warning for Barbados and a tropical storm watch for St. Vincent. Three hours later, at 8 a.m. AST (1200 UTC), the <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service</b> of Antigua issued a tropical storm watch for Montserrat, Antigua, St. Kitts, Nevis and Barbuda. Shortly thereafter the Trinidad and Tobago <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service</b> issued a tropical storm watch for Grenada and its dependencies.|$|E
5|$|The South Pacific Basin, {{as defined}} by the World Meteorological Organization, is split into two sub-areas, {{monitored}} by separate agencies. The first area is between 160°E and 120°W and north of 25°S are monitored by the Fiji <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service</b> (FMS) in Nadi. Those that move south of 25°S are monitored by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Wellington, New Zealand. At the start of the season, a new naming policy was introduced by the Tropical Cyclone Committee for the South Pacific and South- East Indian Ocean. The policy stated that a storm attaining gale-force winds in only one quadrant near its center would be named by the Fiji <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service.</b> This is in contrast to the previous policy in which gale-force winds had to completely surround the center to be named.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} island, Erica {{accelerated}} {{and began to}} rapidly weaken {{in the presence of}} strong wind shear. As a result, the cyclone began a phase of extratropical transition as it quickly paced to the southeast. On 15 March, Erica completed this transition. The remnant low continued to the east-southeast, before the <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service</b> of New Zealand Limited office at Wellington, New Zealand (TCWC Wellington) issued their last advisory on Erica at 1800UTC on 16 March.|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} <b>meteorological</b> <b>services</b> in China {{are concerned}} with atmospheric environmental quality, which {{is directly related to}} human activities and affects human health. In recent years, air pollution and other environmental problems have attracted nationwide attention in China, so the environmental <b>meteorological</b> <b>services</b> have been developed rapidly.

5|$|The Eastern Caribbean Donor Group {{convened a}} meeting on August 16 under the Chair of the Resident Representative United Nations Development Programme Barbados in {{anticipation}} of the hurricane causing significant damage and member states requiring international assistance. At 11 a.m. AST (1500 UTC) the Barbados <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service</b> issued tropical storm warnings for St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Government of the Netherlands Antilles discontinued the hurricane watch on Saba and St. Eustatius, replacing it with a tropical storm warning. At 5 p.m. AST (2100 UTC) August 16, roughly 15hours before Hurricane Dean arrived, the Government of France issued hurricane warnings for Martinique and Guadeloupe and its dependencies, and the NHC issued a tropical storm watch for the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. At 8 p.m. AST (2100 UTC) August 16 the <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service</b> of Antigua issued a tropical storm warning for Anguilla. Martinique's main airport and both of St. Lucia's commercial airports closed that night when the last airplanes landed as the storm's outer rainbands began to sweep over the island. At 11 p.m. AST August 16 (0300 UTC August 17) the NHC upgraded the tropical storm watch on U.S. Virgin Islands to a tropical storm warning. The next morning, August 17, the center of Hurricane Dean passed between St. Lucia and Martinique. The <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service</b> of Antigua issued a tropical storm warning for the British Virgin Islands that same morning, and the Eastern Caribbean Donor Group convened a second meeting to finalize the coordination of three Rapid Assessment Teams.|$|E
5|$|Although officially {{designated}} a tropical cyclone by the NHC, Météo-France, the French <b>meteorological</b> <b>service,</b> stated in their annual {{report to the}} World Meteorological Organization that Grace {{should not have been}} classified a tropical system. In their report, they argued that although the storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, and winds above 60mph (95km/h), the overall development of Grace was more similar to that of a mid-latitude non-tropical cyclone. However, operationally, Météo-France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone. They also criticized the NHC of warning upon this system based on recent trends of the link between global warming and increased hurricane activity.|$|E
5|$|As Lane {{came closer}} to the coastline, all the {{seaports}} between Michoacán and Sinaloa were closed, and the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (Mexico) (National <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service,</b> in Spanish) warned the general population about the threat of flooding and landslides. When the hurricane made landfall, {{the government of the}} state of Sinaloa issued a state of emergency for the municipalities of Ahome, Guasave, Angostura, Salvador Alvarado, Culiacán, Navolato, Elota, San Ignacio and Mazatlán. The arrival of the hurricane forced the closure of several flights at the General Rafael Buelna International Airport in Mazatlán, Sinaloa.|$|E

5|$|Because it {{was unknown}} that Michael became extratropical before landfall, {{it was the}} {{initially}} considered the first tropical cyclone to strike Newfoundland since Hurricane Luis in 1995. Furthermore, Michael was also considered the first hurricane to make landfall in Canada since Hurricane Hortense in 1996. When the <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service</b> of Canada and the National Research Council flew a Convair research flight into Michael on October19, {{it was the first}} successful research flight made into a tropical cyclone by those agencies. Subsequent flights have been made into Tropical Storm Karen, Hurricane Isabel (while inland), Hurricane Juan, and Hurricane Ophelia.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 the Royal Society's {{project was}} concluded, and the {{observatory}} {{was set to}} be abandoned. After a lengthy debate, the fledgling colonial government decided to take over its operation. Rather than disappearing like its three counterparts, the Toronto observatory was upgraded, and its mission was expanded as it became a meteorological station (see <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service</b> of Canada) {{under the direction of}} the Ministry of Marine and Fisheries. During the expansion, the original buildings were replaced with a permanent structure.|$|E
5|$|In Antigua and Barbuda, {{there was}} {{considerable}} flooding of major roads and 2,000people were severely affected and were evacuated. About 516 of the people were housed in emergency shelters. Across the island, the storm killed one person, injured 12, left an elderly blind man missing, and destroyed 500houses and a newly built church. In the village of Crab's Hill, 64of the 81houses were ether seriously damaged or destroyed. The hurricane also disrupted 50% of telephone service and 90% of the homes were left without electricity. A wind gust of 102mph (164km/h) was reported by the Antigua and Barbuda <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service</b> on October20.|$|E

Power stations in Tongatapu were also forced to close to protect the system. No one was injured by the storm but {{there were reports of}} significant crop losses. The Tongan <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service</b> also reported that about $2,000 2009TOP, ($1,000 2009USD) worth of damage had been done to property owned by the service.|$|E
5|$|On December19, a {{tropical}} disturbance formed near Diego Garcia, which initially tracked to the south-southeast {{before turning to}} the southwest. Later that day, the system intensified to moderate tropical storm status, prompting the Mauritius <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service</b> to name it Bakoly. The storm gradually intensified into an intense tropical cyclone, reaching peak winds of 170km/h (105mph) on December23. After maintaining that intensity for about 12hours, Bakoly weakened below cyclone status as it turned to the south-southeast. On December25, the storm passed between Réunion and Mauritius, and later resumed its south-southwest trajectory. After executing a small loop, Bakoly turned to the southeast and dissipated on December30.|$|E
5|$|The South Pacific Ocean basin runs between 160°E and 120°W, with {{tropical}} cyclones {{developing in}} it officially {{monitored by the}} Fiji <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service</b> and New Zealand's MetService. Tropical Cyclones that develop within this basin generally affect countries {{to the west of}} the dateline, though during El Niños cyclones have been known to develop to the east of the dateline near French Polynesia. On average the basin sees nine tropical cyclones annually with about half of them becoming severe tropical cyclones.|$|E

The property damage had an approximate value of about $2,000 (2009TOP, $1,0002009 USD). This included a Stevenson screen, office guttering, a HF radio antennae, signal processor, and satellite receiver. They also {{reported that}} the National weather forecasting center in Fua’amotu had experienced power failure on April 4 at 1600 UTC; for this reason the center operated using a small portable generator until early {{the next day when}} they stopped issuing warnings as Lin was no longer a threat to Tonga. Power was eventually restored later that day.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} wave {{from which}} Alex developed produced rainfall across the Greater Antilles {{in the central}} Caribbean Sea. In the Dominican Republic, the rainfall triggered flooding that prompted the evacuations of over 3,000people, mostly due to swollen rivers. In {{the capital city of}} Santo Domingo, 160houses were flooded, and one person was killed by the storm; one additional person was reported missing. In nearby San Juan de la Maguana, more than 500homes were inundated. In neighboring Haiti, minor flooding was reported in Gonaïves. The Jamaica <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service</b> issued a flash flood warning for its entire island in response to the tropical wave producing thunderstorms across the nation.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Annette {{developed}} {{simultaneously with}} Cyclone Willy in the Australian basin and Cyclone Haja in the south-west Indian. On February3, a tropical low formed {{northeast of the}} Cocos Islands. Steered by a ridge to the south, it moved generally southwestward and intensified into Tropical Cyclone Annette, named by the Bureau of Meteorology. After executing a loop, Annette crossed 80E into the south-west Indian Ocean on February16. Upon crossing into the basin, the storm was renamed Jaminy by the Mauritius <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service.</b> Around that time, the cyclone attained peak winds of 170km/h (105mph). Jaminy moved generally southwestward and weakened below cyclone status on February20. The next day, it turned to the southeast, later dissipating on February24.|$|E

5|$|On January1, 2002, the JTWC {{classified}} {{the depression}} as a tropical storm, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 08S. The system rapidly organized shortly after and was further upgraded to a moderate tropical storm by Météo-France at 0600UTC, {{at which time}} the <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service</b> of Madagascar gave it the name Cyprien. In response to a mid to upper-level subtropical high pressure area, the storm tracked in a general eastward direction at 16km/h (10mph). Several hours after being named, the JTWC assessed Cyprien to have reached its peak winds of 95km/h (60mph 1-minute winds). QuickSCAT satellite passes indicated areas of 100km/h (65mph) winds early on January2, prompting Météo-France to upgrade Cyprien to a severe tropical storm, with winds peaking at 100km/h (65mph 10-minute winds). By this time, the central barometric pressure fell to 980hPa (mbar).|$|E
5|$|Several {{countries}} employ {{government agencies}} to provide forecasts and watches/warnings/advisories {{to the public}} in order to protect life and property and maintain commercial interests.

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Ivy (Fiji <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Service</b> designation: 05F, Joint Typhoon Warning Center designation: 13P) was a {{tropical}} cyclone that affected about 25% {{of the population}} of Vanuatu in February 2004. It was first classified as {{a tropical}} disturbance on February21 between Vanuatu and Fiji. The system tracked northwestward, gradually organizing and intensifying. After attaining tropical storm status on February23, Ivy strengthened more quickly as it turned southwestward toward Vanuatu. It attained peak winds of 165km/h (105mph) while moving over Vanuatu, making it an intense Category4 cyclone on the Australian Region Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. By the time it passed through Vanuatu, Ivy had turned southeastward, and it gradually weakened while accelerating. After becoming extratropical on February28, it passed just east of New Zealand and eventually dissipated on March2.|$|E
