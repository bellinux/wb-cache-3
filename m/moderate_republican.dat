5|$|In 1874, a <b>moderate</b> <b>Republican,</b> Daniel Henry Chamberlain, {{was elected}} South Carolina's governor, {{attracting}} even some Democratic votes. When Chamberlain sought re-election in 1876, Gary recruited Wade HamptonIII, a Confederate war hero {{who had moved}} out of state, to return and run for governor as a Democrat.

It occurred in Hamburg, South Carolina, a mostly black town across the river from Augusta, in Aiken County, bordering Edgefield County. The incident grew out of a confrontation on July 4 when a black militia marched in Hamburg and two white farmers in a buggy tried to ride through its ranks. Both sides filed criminal charges against the other, and dozens of armed out-of-uniform Red Shirts, led by Butler, traveled to Hamburg on the day of the hearing, July 8. Tillman was present, and the subsequent events were among his proudest memories.|$|E

5|$|The {{storming}} of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, {{had been}} celebrated annually since 1790, initially through quasi-religious rituals, {{and then later}} during the Revolution with grand, secular events including the burning of replica Bastilles. Under Napoleon the events became less revolutionary, focusing instead on military parades and national unity {{in the face of}} foreign threats. During the 1870s, the 14 July celebrations became a rallying point for Republicans opposed to the early monarchist leadership of the Third Republic; when the <b>moderate</b> <b>Republican</b> Jules Grévy became president in 1879, his new government turned the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille into a national holiday. The anniversary remained contentious, with hard-line Republicans continuing to use the occasion to protest against the new political order and right-wing conservatives protesting about the imposition of the holiday. The July Column itself remained contentious and Republican radicals unsuccessfully tried to blow it up in 1871.|$|E
