40|$|<b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>conditionality</b> {{has become}} one of the major {{elements}} in discussions on the future of EU cohesion policy. Such conditional-ity would make the cohesion budget dependent on EU economic governance rules. This would have advantages for economic governance and, to a lesser extent, the efficiency of cohesion policy and the EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework negotiations. Yet, conditionality also risks entailing serious disadvantages for the end beneficiaries and cohesion policy itself. If the EU decides to put <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>conditionality</b> in place, it needs to reconsider the design and agree on an ample cohesion budget...|$|E
40|$|The idea of {{introducing}} contracts between Member States and the EU on structural reforms has its merits, {{it also has}} several disadvantages. Most notably, the contracts risk rendering European economic governance even more complex and cumbersome. It is therefore sensible to first try to integrate the structural reform contracts {{into one of the}} foreseen economic governance instruments. This Policy Brief argues that <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>conditionality</b> can serve this purpose. With some minor reforms, it could even become a full-fledged substitute for structural reform contracts – without suffering some of latter’s disadvantages...|$|E
40|$|Drawing on {{conditionality}} {{and implementation}} information for 184 World Bank adjustment loans to 62 countries during the 1980 s, the authors examine the macroeconomic underpinnings of Bank supported adjustment programs. After looking at recent experience with <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>conditionality</b> they conclude that macroeconomic policy reform and improved macroeconomic performance {{are critical to}} successful implementation and sustainability of structural reform. Further, they conclude that macroeconomic policy and sequencing issues increasingly have been addressed explicitly {{in the design of}} recent adjustment loans, but there is still scope for : 1) strengthening the analytical framework and macroeconomic policy conditionality in adjustment loans; and 2) greater realism about the time and external resources needed to achieve adjustment and growth objectives.

40|$|The Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) {{framework}} {{introduced by}} the World Bank and the IMF {{at the turn of}} the century goes well beyond the mainly <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>conditionalities</b> of the structural adjustment era by requesting that civil society participates in the preparation and the implementation of the strategy. Although constituting a significant shift in the international financial institutions’ discourse, the difference in the way in which the traditional and the “participation” conditions are scrutinized for compliance, considerably reduces the compulsory nature of the latter conditionality. Whereas clear standards and criteria are developed to evaluate compliance with the economic conditionalities, such standards seem to be lacking in the case of participation. This paper reviews the evaluation of the civil society participation in PRSP documents by the Joint Staff of the World Bank and the IMF. This desk-based study of 35 Joint Staff Assessments (JSAs) finds these JSAs to lack both clarity and candour. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to determine the}} most significant tendencies and changes observed in Poland’s core markets of agricultural products, which occurred during the period preceding Poland’s accession to the European Union (1994 - 2003) and after the accession (2004 - 2013). The key markets of agricultural products include markets with the largest value of commodity production during the analysed period, such as cereals, potatoes, sugar beet, rapeseed, fruit, vegetables, pork, beef and poultry, cows’ milks and eggs. The development of domestic production, consumption and real purchasing prices were observed and compared {{in order to achieve}} the main objective. The research was preceded by the characterisation of <b>macroeconomic</b> and resource <b>conditionalities</b> of agricultural production as well as the trade balance of the Polish agri-food sector. On the basis of the conducted studies, there were singled out three groups of markets in which the situation during the period following Poland’s accession to the EU developed in a similar way...|$|R
40|$|A common {{feature in}} {{programs}} of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) {{is the use of}} <b>conditionalities,</b> <b>macroeconomic</b> and structural measures that a requesting country should adopt to obtain an assistance package. The objective of this work is to conduct an empirical analysis of the economic and political determinants of such conditionalities. In particular, our main contribution consists {{in the development of a}} new measure of conditionality, fiscal adjustment, and its comparison with the most used in the literature, the number of conditions. We choose fiscal adjustment because it is an adequate proxy for program austerity, since its implementation carries economic and political costs. In the empirical exercise, we use data from 184 programs in the period of 1999 and 2012, and estimate how our two measures of conditionalities respond to the economic and political factors. Our results suggest that they are quite different. The main determinant of the number of conditions is the political proximity of the borrowing country to the Fund’s major shareholders, the members of G 5. On the other hand, the main determinant of fiscal adjustment is the size of the government fiscal deficit. Finally, we did not find correlation between the size of fiscal adjustment and the number of conditions. These results suggest that the analysis of the content of IMF programs should take into account the different measures of agreed conditionality...|$|R
40|$|Madagascar showed {{satisfactory}} performance {{under the}} Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program. Executive Directors {{agreed that the}} crisis has undermined the timely achievement of the program, requiring the government to redouble its efforts. They welcomed the 2003 budget and {{stressed the need for}} strengthening fiscal and monetary policies and accelerating structural reforms. They urged the need to address the problems of inefficiency and corruption in the public administration. They emphasized the need to decisively implement the strategy, and successfully complete the third review under the PRGF arrangement.
