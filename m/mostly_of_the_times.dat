A análise de campo se concentra na Ilha de Santa Catarina, no litoral sul brasileiro, onde adotei como técnica a flânerie, realizada entre junho de 2010 e janeiro de 2011 por lugares de sociabilidade homossexual da Ilha e comumente frequentados por turistas e residentes, tais como bares e danceterias. Dentre os resultados, identifiquei um perfil recorrente de homens em viagens que buscam sexo, em sua maioria viajando sozinhos por motivos profissionais, com idade entre 35 e 55 anos, notadamente profissionais liberais, que permanecem na Ilha de dois a quatro dias e que buscam sexo fora do circuito da prostituição, mas sim, pela simples troca de prazer sexual entre ambos. A Liberation Journey: Beyond the Frontiers of Social Sexuality - This text {{presents}} an ethnography of public heterosexual identity {{men who are}} searching for homoerotic interactions when they’re away from familiar environment, and traveling represents a moment of freedom versus them heteronormative daily life. Field analysis focused {{on the island of}} Santa Catarina, in the southern coast of Brazil. I used the flânerie technique between June 2010 and January 2011 at homosexual sociability places which were frequented by tourists and residents, such as bars and discos. Among the results, I identified a men’ profile searching sex while they’re traveling, <b>mostly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> alone, for business, between 35 and 55 years old, and them remain on the island for more two or four days looking sex out of the prostitution’s trade, just to have sex only for sexual pleasure for both.  ...|$|E

Unfortunally the recent war {{is the reason for}} many {{cultural}} heritage items to be destroyed, beyond the thausand civilian people killed. In 2010, just before the war, the A. made a touristic trip together with Crua (Recreational Club of the Ancona University). It was the occasion to make some fast documentation of some Syrian CH monuments. Mostly of the images were taken by the A. not to make a survey, but as a photographic report, as fast and complete as possible. For a regular survey project, the tripod, the spherical head should be used for the takings and the 3 x 3 Cipa rules should be followed, that occurred only in the three main projects, say the survey of the citadel walls in Aleppo, the survey of the Umayyads Mosque in Damascus, and the survey of the minaret of the Umayyads Mosque in Aleppo. All the other documentation surveys have been carried out with hand-held camera taking the dimension of the model from Google earth high resolution, when available. But, apart the regular surveys, due to the explosion of the unexpected war, the photographs taken in such a touristic way, have been used to try to get some usable plottings an restitutions and it worked successfully <b>mostly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times.</b> These surveys could be useful in case of reconstruction and in case of lack of suitable alternative metric documentation. Because of the continuing threats, all six Syrian World Heritage properties were inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger, at the 37 th session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Cambodia last June: Ancient City of Aleppo, Ancient City of Bosra, Ancient City of Damascus, Ancient Villages of Northern Syria, Krak des Chevaliers and Qal’at Salah El-Din ans finally the Site of Palmyra.

Followed by [...] "Other but Reality" [...] which featured Tony playing drums along synths and a sample taken from a German choir multitrack tape Ays was using to exercise with his mixing skills. Radio Detroit industrial broadcast the song and few more songs were recorded in the studio, including [...] "David's Dream" [...] and [...] "4 (Pythagoras' Theme)". Although the full album [...] "Stardust from a Cup of Tea" [...] was recorded, the release was dropped. Instead they took the recording and made a remix <b>of</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>the</b> songs.

40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this {{contribution}} is to broaden <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> music analysis from a disembodied cognitivist approach to an experiential approach. Revolving around <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> {{music as a}} temporal and sounding art, it argues for an analytical approach that brings together <b>the</b> richness <b>of</b> sensory experience and principles of cognitive economy. Musical sense-making, in this view, relies on two distinctive strategies: tracking <b>the</b> moment-to-moment history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual unfolding or recollecting actual and previous sounding events {{in a kind of}} synoptic overview. Both positions are not opposed but complement each other. What is needed, however, is a comprehensive framework that provides both conceptual and operational tools. Five major possibilities are proposed: (i) <b>the</b> concepts <b>of</b> perspective and resolution, which refer to the distance the listener takes with respect to the sounding music and <b>the</b> fine-grainedness <b>of</b> his/her discriminative abilities; (ii) the continuous/discrete dichotomy which conceives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music as one continuous flow as against a division in separate and distinct elements; (iii) the in time/outside-of-time distinction, with the former proceeding in real <b>time</b> and <b>the</b> latter proceeding <b>mostly</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> actual unfolding; (iv) the deictic approach to musical sense-making, which describes <b>the</b> actual context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> referential exchange between the music and the listener; and (v) <b>the</b> levels <b>of</b> processing, which span a continuum between primitive sensory reactivity and high-level symbolic processing. All these approaches are brought together in an encompassing framework that tries to provide the operational tools for analysis-by-ear, which offers the first and most direct access to the music as it unfolds in time. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{scheduling}} in high-end parallel systems {{focuses on}} how to minimize the average job waiting time and {{on how to}} maximize the overall system utilization. Despite <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> scheduling strategies that aim at maximizing system utilization, parallel supercomputing traces that span long time periods indicate that such systems are <b>mostly</b> underutilized. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> there is simply not enough load to keep the system fully utilized, although time periods do exist where system utilization levels peak at nearly 95 %.

Our goal is <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> a scheduling mechanism that adaptively adjusts <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> processors to <b>the</b> offered load while meeting predefined service-level agreements (SLAs).

40|$|The {{recent and}} fossil pollen data {{obtained}} under <b>the</b> frame <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multi-disciplinary international El'gygytgyn Drilling Project represent a unique archive, which allows <b>the</b> testing <b>of</b> {{a range of}} pollen-based reconstruction approaches and <b>the</b> deciphering <b>of</b> changes in <b>the</b> regional vegetation and climate. In the current study we provide details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biome reconstruction method applied to the late Pliocene and Quaternary pollen records from Lake El'gygytgyn. All terrestrial pollen taxa identified in the spectra from Lake El'gygytgyn were assigned to major vegetation types (biomes), which today occur near the lake and in <b>the</b> broader region <b>of</b> eastern and northern Asia and, thus, could be potentially present in this region during the past. When applied to the pollen spectra from the middle Pleistocene to present, the method suggests (1) a predominance <b>of</b> tundra during <b>the</b> Holocene, (2) a short interval during the marine isotope stage (MIS) 5. 5 interglacial distinguished by cold deciduous forest, and (3) long phases of taiga dominance during MIS 31 and, particularly, MIS 11. 3. These two latter interglacials seem to be some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longest and warmest intervals in the study region within the past million years. During the late Pliocene–early Pleistocene interval (i. e., ~ 3. 562 – 2. 200 Ma), there is good correspondence between the millennial-scale vegetation changes documented in the Lake El'gygytgyn record and <b>the</b> alternation <b>of</b> cold and warm marine isotope stages, which reflect changes in the global ice volume and sea level. The biome reconstruction demonstrates changes in the regional vegetation from generally warmer/wetter environments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier (i. e., Pliocene) interval towards colder/drier environments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pleistocene. The reconstruction indicates that the taxon-rich cool mixed and cool conifer forest biomes are <b>mostly</b> characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> prior to MIS G 16, whereas the tundra biome becomes a prominent feature starting from MIS G 6. These results consistently indicate that the study region supported significant tree populations during most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interval prior to ~ 2. 730 Ma. The cold- and drought-tolerant steppe biome first appears in the reconstruction ~ 3. 298 Ma during the tundra-dominated MIS M 2, whereas the tundra biome initially occurs between ~ 3. 379 and ~ 3. 378 Ma within MIS MG 4.

40|$|Gerald Finzi (1901 - 1956) {{amassed a}} library that {{numbered}} over three thousand volumes, <b>mostly</b> <b>of</b> poetry, by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> {{his death and}} was extremely selective when choosing poems to set to music. Settings of Thomas Hardy form <b>the</b> bulk <b>of</b> his output for solo voice, but for his choral works he returned {{again and again to}} seventeenth -century metaphysical poets like George Herbert, Richard Crashaw, Henry Vaughan, Thomas Traherne and Edward Taylor. These poets relied more upon rational thought than on intuition or theology in their work, and even their religious passion was filtered through reason. <b>The</b> extent <b>of</b> their use of wit, paradox, puns and their unusual juxtaposition of images, such as Andrew Marvell's comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soul to a drop of dew, had not been seen before in English sacred poetry. Finzi, an agnostic, was attracted to their questioning of traditional, accepted religious thinking, and he frequently quoted these poets in his letters. <b>The</b> loss <b>of</b> loved ones at an early age, his affinity for <b>the</b> pessimism <b>of</b> his poetic idol Thomas Hardy, his rejection of religious dogma, and his constant awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frailty <b>of</b> human existence would all influence his choice of texts for vocal and choral works. When commissioned to write sacred choral works, Finzi turned to Richard Crashaw, Henry Vaughan and Edward Taylor for poetic, not dogmatic, religious poetry. Gerald Finzi's first five works for chorus were settings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poetry <b>of</b> George Herbert, Henry Vaughan and Thomas Traherne, and he continued to set metaphysical poetry throughout his career. It would ultimately account for over twenty-five percent of his total output of music for chorus. Finzi consistently responded to the elaborate conceits and surprising juxtapositions that characterize metaphysical poetry with musical surprises using harmony, tonality, meter, rhythm, texture, voicing and melodic shape. Always allegiant to the principles and values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pastoral composers who preceded him, Finzi created music that is characterized by an ever-present sense of elegiac melancholy often expressed in Romantic melodic gestures accompanied by consonant harmony. He earns this seeming indulgence, however, through frequent use of dissonance, usually placed in low sonorities, Bachian contrapuntal textures, and even modernist elements. In terms of scholarship and philosophy, Gerald Finzi and the metaphysical poets were kindred spirits. An exploration of this subject that details precisely how Finzi responded to these poems in his musical settings of them will lead conductors, musicians and listeners to a more thorough understanding of these pieces and the artist who created them...|$|R
