2500|$|Prior to Rasmussen's exit, the doping {{revelations of}} Sinkewitz and Vinokourov had been met with {{defiance}} by the UCI, the Tour organizers {{and the majority}} of the European press (with certain exceptions) however, with Rasmussen's sacking whilst wearing the yellow jersey (no rider had previously been withdrawn from the race while leading), the mood became more pessimistic, with the exception of Tour director Christian Prudhomme who publicly regarded the Dane's withdrawal as [...] "the best thing that can happen to the Tour. The race will go on {{for the rest of the}} riders and we believe it would be an insult to them to stop the race. We believe the general classification is <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>now</b> than it was." ...|$|E

2500|$|Scholars {{and authors}} have also commented on these changes. Southern Methodist University's Director of Medieval Studies Bonnie Wheeler is [...] "convinced {{that the new}} Robert Zemeckis movie {{treatment}} sacrifices {{the power of the}} original for a plot line that propels Beowulf into seduction by Angelina Jolie—the mother of the monster he has just slain. What man doesn’t get involved with Angelina Jolie?' Wheeler asks. 'It’s a great cop-out on a great poem.' ... 'For me, the sad thing is the movie returns to…a view of the horror of woman, the monstrous female who will kill off the male,' Wheeler says. 'It seems to me you could do so <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>now.</b> And the story of Beowulf is so much more powerful.'" [...] Other commentators pointed to the theories elucidated in John Grigsby's work Beowulf and Grendel, where Grendel's mother was linked with the ancient Germanic fertility goddess Nerthus.|$|E

In a statement, British Airways said: [...] "A male customer became aggressive and abusive at check-in when he was refused travel on a flight from Gatwick to Bologna.

Marianne hadn't been drinking {{at the time of the}} incident and she does not drink alcohol. She is enjoying life and loving it as she is sober and clean." [...] Faithfull revealed that although Ravard was still her manager, their 15-year relationship had ended some months ago. Faithfull stated, [...] "I'm all right but I have had a bit of an adventure – my relationship broke up. I felt very betrayed and lonely.

[...] On 3 May 2009, she was featured on CBS News Sunday Morning and interviewed by Anthony Mason in the [...] "Sunday Profile" [...] segment. Both in-studio and on-the-street (New York City) interview segments with Faithfull and Mason were interspersed with extensive biographical and musical footage.|$|E
