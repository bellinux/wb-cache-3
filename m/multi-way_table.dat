40|$|Exploratory Data Analysis is {{a widely}} used {{technique}} to determine which factors have the most in uence on data values in a <b>multi-way</b> <b>table,</b> or which cells in the table can be considered anomalous {{with respect to the}} other cells. In particular, median polish is a simple, yet robust method to perform Exploratory Data Analysis. Median polish is resistant to holes in the table (cells that have no values), but it may require a lot of iterations through the data. This factor makes it di cult to apply median polish to large multidimensional tables, since the I/O requirements may be prohibitive. This paper describes a technique that uses median polish over an approximation of a datacube, easing the burden of I/O. The results obtained are tested for quality, using a variety of measures. The technique scales to large datacubes and proves to give agood approximation of the results that would have been obtained by median polish in the original data. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the problem {{where we have}} a <b>multi-way</b> <b>table</b> of means, indexed by several factors, where each factor can have a large number of levels. The entry in each cell is the mean of some response, averaged over the observations falling into that cell. Some cells may be very sparsely populated, and in extreme cases, not populated at all. We might still like to estimate an expected response in such cells. We propose here a novel hierarchical ANOVA (HANOVA) representation for such data. Sparse cells will lean more on the lower-order interaction model for the data. These in turn could have components that are poorly represented in the data, in which case they rely on yet lower-order models. Our approach leads to a simple hierarchical algorithm, requiring repeated calculations of sub-table means of modified counts. The algorithm has shown superiority over the unshrinked methods in both simulations and real data sets. Comment: 14 pages, 1 figur...|$|E

40|$|We propose Bayesian methods {{with five}} types of priors to {{estimate}} cell probabilities in an incomplete multi-way contingency table under nonignorable nonresponse.

To deal with such a <b>multi-way</b> <b>table,</b> we present an EM algorithm which generalizes the previous algorithm used for incomplete one-way tables. Three of the five types of priors were previously introduced while {{the other two are}} newly proposed to reflect different response patterns between respondents and nonrespondents.

40|$|Bounds for {{the cell}} counts in <b>multi-way</b> {{contingency}} <b>tables</b> given {{a set of}} marginal totals arise {{in a variety of}} different statistical contexts including disclosure limitation. We describe the Generalized Shuttle Algorithm for computing integer bounds of <b>multi-way</b> contingency <b>tables</b> induced by arbitrary linear constraints on cell counts.

Our algorithm for computing sharp bounds and enumerating multiway contingency tables is the first approach that relies exclusively on the unique structure of the categorical data and does not employ any other optimization techniques such as linear or integer programming.

40|$|When {{conducting}} matrix {{experiments in}} several industrial situations, engineers {{deal with an}} ordered categorical response. Several techniques have been proposed {{for the analysis of}} ordered categorical data with a focus on quality improvement in industrial settings. In such context, Correspondence analysis, a popular descriptive/exploratory technique designed to analyze simple two-way and <b>multi-way</b> <b>tables,</b> could be useful to analyze the strength of association between variables. Unfortunately, Correspondence analysis does not keep into account the information arising from the ordinal nature of variables. In order to overcome that problem, a variant of Correspondence Analysis, based on the decomposition of Taguchis statistic, has been proposed. In this paper we highlight the properties of the decomposition of Taguchis index, showing how such technique could be applied in the context of industrial experiment. The procedure is illustrated with a case study and our findings support that the proposed analysis is capable of solving industrial problems with an ordered categorical response in a multifactor state system...|$|R

This contribution addresses the problem of automatically analyzing large multidimensional tables to get a concise representation of data, identify patterns and provide approximate answers to queries. Since data cubes are nothing but <b>multi-way</b> <b>tables,</b> we propose to analyze the potential of a probabilistic modeling technique, called non-negative multi-way array factorization, for approximating aggregate and multidimensional values. Using such a technique, we compute the set of components (clusters) that best fit the initial data set and whose superposition approximates the original data. The generated components can then be exploited for approximately answering OLAP queries such as roll-up, slice and dice operations. The proposed modeling technique will then be compared against the log-linear modeling technique which has already {{been used in the}} literature for compression and outlier detection in data cubes. Finally, three data sets will be used to discuss the potential benefits of non-negative multiway array factorization...|$|R

In this paper we extend their result to zero-one multi-way (d-way, d ≥ 2) contingency tables under the no d-way interaction model, i. e., with fixed d - 1 marginal sums. Also we show by simulations that the SIS procedure with CP distribution to estimate the number of zero-one three-way tables under the no three-way interaction model given marginal sums works very well even with some rejections.

40|$|Background: How can we compute a {{segregation}} or diversity index from {{a three-way}} or <b>multi-way</b> contingency <b>table,</b> where each variable {{can take on}} an arbitrary finite number of values and where the index takes values between zero and one? Previous methods only exist for two-way contingency tables or dichotomous variables. A prototypical three-way case is the segregation index {{of a set of}} industries or departments given multiple explanatory variables of both sex and race. This can be further extended to other variables, such as disability, number of years of education, and former military service. Methodology/Principal Findings: We extend existing segregation indices based on Euclidean distance (square of coefficient of variation) and Boltzmann/Shannon/Theil index from two-way to <b>multi-way</b> contingency <b>tables</b> by including multiple summations. We provide several biological applications, such as indices for age polyethism and linkage disequilibrium. We also provide a new heuristic conceptualization of entropy-based indices. Higher order association measures are often independent of lower order ones, hence an overall segregation or diversity index should be the arithmetic mean of the normalized association measures at all orders. These methods are applicable when individuals selfidentify as multiple races or even multiple sexes and when individuals work part-time in multiple industries.
