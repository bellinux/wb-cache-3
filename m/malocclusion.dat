25|$|As {{a dental}} anthropologist, Corruccini is most noted {{for his work}} on <b>malocclusion,</b> though his {{research}} is not limited to any particular aspect of human or non-human primate dentition or biology. Much of his early fieldwork in dentition and many of his 250-plus publications focused on twins, immigrants, Australian Aborigines, and on the Indian subcontinent, with this research being funded by the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Leakey Foundation. However, Corruccini's research into <b>malocclusion</b> led him to conduct broad and comprehensive studies among a diverse number of subjects, including an isolate population of European-Americans in rural Kentucky, the Pima Tribe, natives of Peru, hominoids, and modern Chinese.|$|E
30|$|Angle's class II {{division}} 1 <b>malocclusions</b> exhibit various morphological characteristics.

30|$|Patients with {{skeletal}} class III <b>malocclusions</b> have {{a prominent}} and protrusive lower {{face and a}} relatively inconspicuous and retruding upper face, resulting in a concave profile. Class III <b>malocclusions,</b> which are skeletal facial deformities, are characterized by retrusion and deficiency of the maxilla and excessive growth and protrusion of the mandible. Almost two thirds of skeletal class III <b>malocclusions</b> are due to either retrusion of the maxilla {{or a combination of}} maxillary retrusion and mandibular protrusion [1 – 3].|$|R
30|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{alveolar bone}} dehiscence and fenestration are common findings {{in different types}} of <b>malocclusions</b> [1 – 5], especially in the anterior region of class III <b>malocclusions</b> [1, 5]. Dehiscence and fenestration may lead to gingival recession and additional bone loss during orthodontic treatment [6 – 8]. In addition, large amount of labial inclination such as decompensation in class III <b>malocclusions</b> may pose {{a greater risk of}} periodontal complications, such as alveolar dehiscence and fenestration and gingival recession [9 – 12].|$|R

25|$|Chewing: Horses {{may develop}} choke {{if they do}} not chew their food properly. Therefore, horses with dental {{problems}} (e.g. acquired or congenital <b>malocclusion,</b> loose or missing teeth, or excessively sharp dental ridges) that do not allow them to completely grind their food are particularly at risk. In addition, horses that bolt their feed and do not take the time to chew properly are more likely to suffer from choke.|$|E
25|$|By far, the {{two most}} common {{symptoms}} described are pain and the feeling that teeth no longer correctly meet (traumatic <b>malocclusion,</b> or disocclusion). The teeth {{are very sensitive to}} pressure (proprioception), so even a small change in the location of the teeth will generate this sensation. People will also be very sensitive to touching the area of the jaw that is broken, {{or in the case of}} condylar fracture the area just in front of the tragus of the ear.|$|E
40|$|Background Prolonged oral {{respiration}} {{is known}} to cause postural alterations, {{which can lead to}} dental <b>malocclusions.</b> Allergic rhinitis, a common cause of upper airway obstruction in children, must therefore be seen as a possible risk factor in the development of <b>malocclusions.</b> Aim Aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the association between allergic rhinitis and <b>malocclusions</b> in primary and early-mixed dentition. Design A case-control study was carried out involving 275 Italian children aged 5 - 9. The case group and the control group were composed of 125 individuals affected by <b>malocclusions</b> and by 150 healthy patients, respectively. Through a questionnaire, we assessed the presence of professionally diagnosed allergic rhinitis. Data were analysed to identify associations between these variables and the presence of <b>malocclusions.</b> Results Children with a history of allergic rhinitis had a threefold increased risk to develop one or more dento-skeletal alterations [OR= 3. 16; 95 % CI (1. 79 - 5. 58), P< 0. 001]. Statistically significant associations were found between allergic rhinitis and the development of posterior crossbite and increased overjet. No significant association was found for anterior openbite. Conclusions Allergic rhinitis is a significant risk factor for the development of <b>malocclusions</b> in general and is associated with the development of posterior crossbite and increased overjet...|$|R
40|$|Background : {{educational}} {{programs aimed at}} increasing knowledge on oral health and promoting proper oral hygiene habits allow controlling or limiting the development of dento-maxillofacial defects that lead to many aesthetic, functional and mental disorders. Objective : to assess the effectiveness of an educational intervention on risk factors associated with <b>malocclusions</b> in children aged five years. Methods : a quasi-experimental, before and after {{study was conducted in}} 67 children living in the Health Area number 2 in Cienfuegos municipality. Risk factors associated with <b>malocclusions</b> were identified, as well as the knowledge needs of the children and their parents. An educational program on risk factors associated with <b>malocclusions</b> was designed and implemented. Surveys were applied before and after the intervention. The variables studied included risk factors associated with <b>malocclusions</b> and the level of knowledge about them. Results : children and parents increased their knowledge about risk factors associated with <b>malocclusions.</b> Ninety four point three percent of the most common oral habits (tongue thrusting, finger-sucking and bottle feeding) were eliminated. Conclusion : the intervention was effective since it raised the level of knowledge of the children and their parents and led to the elimination of a considerable number of modifiable risk factors associated with <b>malocclusions...</b>|$|R
30|$|Therefore, the {{objective}} of this work is to test the following null hypothesis: dentoskeletal and soft tissue changes are similar between type 1 class II subdivision <b>malocclusions</b> treated with two maxillary and one mandibular premolar extractions to type 2 class II subdivision <b>malocclusions</b> treated with one maxillary premolar extraction.|$|R
25|$|Achondroplasia can be {{detected}} before birth {{by the use of}} prenatal ultrasound. A DNA test can be performed before birth to detect homozygosity, wherein two copies of the mutant gene are inherited, a lethal condition leading to stillbirths. Clinical features include megalocephaly, short limbs, prominent forehead, thoracolumbar kyphosis and mid-facial hypoplasia. Complications like dental <b>malocclusion,</b> hydrocephalus and repeated otitis media can be observed. The risk of death in infancy is increased due to the likelihood of compression of the spinal cord with or without upper airway obstruction.|$|E
25|$|Prognathism is the {{positional}} {{relationship of the}} mandible or maxilla to the skeletal base where either of the jaws protrudes beyond a predetermined imaginary line in the coronal plane of the skull. In general dentistry, oral and maxillofacial surgery and orthodontics, this is assessed clinically or radiographically (cephalometrics). The word prognathism derives from Greek pro ("forward") and γνάθος gnáthos ("jaw"). One or more types of prognathism may result in the common condition of <b>malocclusion,</b> in which an individual's top teeth and lower teeth do not align properly.|$|E
25|$|Abdominal pain due to hypersplenism and splenic {{infarction}} and right-upper quadrant pain {{caused by}} gallstones are major clinical manifestations. However, diagnosing thalassemiæ from symptoms alone is inadequate. Physicians note these signs as associative {{due to this}} disease's complexity. The following associative signs can attest to {{the severity of the}} phenotype: pallor, poor growth, inadequate food intake, splenomegaly, jaundice, maxillary hyperplasia, dental <b>malocclusion,</b> cholelithiasis, systolic ejection murmur in the presence of severe anemia and pathologic fractures. Based on symptoms, tests are ordered for a differential diagnosis. These tests include complete blood count; hemoglobin electrophoresis; serum transferrin, ferritin, total iron-binding capacity; urine urobilin and urobilogen; peripheral blood smear, which may show codocytes, or target cells; hematocrit; and serum bilirubin.|$|E
30|$|A {{previous}} review from Rossini et al. [33] demonstrated that Invisalign® is effective for simple <b>malocclusions</b> treatment.

40|$|Craniofacial {{skeletal}} dysplasia {{can lead}} to different skeletal <b>malocclusions.</b> Both environmental factors and heredity contribute {{to the formation of}} <b>malocclusions.</b> There are strong familial tendencies in the development of Angle's Class II and III <b>malocclusions.</b> Cases such as opposite-typed (Class II and III) <b>malocclusions</b> with skeletal and dentoalveolar discordance in siblings or dizygotic (DZ) twins have seldom been reported. We describe the rare case of a pair of opposite-sex DZ twins with completely different skeletal <b>malocclusions,</b> and discuss the clinical considerations for treatment. The patients were twins aged 13 years and 4 months. The girl had mandibular prognathism and a Class III dentoskeletal relationship, whereas the boy had skeletal Class II with mandibular retrusion. Several morphological traits have been implicated with hormonal effect. However, {{there was no evidence of}} whether the masculinization effect had any impact on jaw size in the female fetus or whether this effect lasted into adolescence. We suggest that, although DZ twins share the same growth environment, genetic or other unknown extrinsic factors can result in discordance of characteristics of the craniofacial skeleton, dentition, and occlusion...|$|R

25|$|Maxillary prognathism is a {{protrusion}} of the maxilla, and is {{a common}} feature in Sub Saharan Africans. Prognathism is less prevalent in East Asians and Caucasians. It {{is not to be}} confused with micrognathism, although combinations of both may be found. It affects the middle third of the face, causing it to jut out, thereby increasing the facial area, similar in phenotype of archaic hominids and apes. Mandibular prognathism is a protrusion of the mandible, affecting the lower third of the face. Alveolar prognathism is a protrusion of that portion of the maxilla where the teeth are located, in the dental lining of the upper jaw. Prognathism can also be used to describe ways that the maxillary and mandibular dental arches relate to one another, including <b>malocclusion</b> (where the upper and lower teeth do not align). When there is maxillary and/or alveolar prognathism which causes an alignment of the maxillary incisors significantly anterior to the lower teeth, the condition is called an overjet. When the reverse is the case, and the lower jaw extends forward beyond the upper, the condition is referred to as retrognathia (reverse overjet).|$|E
25|$|Mixed {{dentition}} starts {{when the}} first permanent molar appears in the mouth, usually at six years, and lasts until the last primary tooth is lost, usually at eleven or twelve years. Permanent teeth in the maxilla erupt in a different order from permanent teeth on the mandible. Maxillary teeth erupt in the following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) lateral incisor, (4) first premolar, (5) second premolar, (6) canine, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. Mandibular teeth erupt in the following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) lateral incisor, (4) canine, (5) first premolar, (6) second premolar, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. Since there are no premolars in the primary dentition, the primary molars are replaced by permanent premolars. If any primary teeth are lost before permanent teeth are ready to replace them, some posterior teeth may drift forward and cause space to {{be lost in the}} mouth. This may cause crowding and/or misplacement once the permanent teeth erupt, which is usually referred to as <b>malocclusion.</b> Orthodontics may be required in such circumstances for an individual to achieve a straight set of teeth.|$|E
500|$|Djungarian hamsters {{are often}} {{found on the}} pet market in Europe, Japan, and North America. Care of the Djungarian hamster is similar to all other species of Phodopus. Djungarian hamsters, along with most rodents, are prone to tumours. They can also receive injury in the cheek pouch by sharp objects {{damaging}} the fragile inner lining. Other health problems include bite wounds, broken teeth, constipation, dehydration, dental <b>malocclusion,</b> diarrhea, and ear problems. The Djungarian hamster is easy to tame. In addition to natural colourings in the wild ("ruddy" [...] or [...] "agouti"), Djungarian hamsters in captivity occur {{in a variety of}} different colors.|$|E
40|$|Functional {{appliances}} {{were developed}} to correct mainly Class II <b>malocclusions</b> in growing children but the influence of those appliances on craniofacial growth is still controversial, even when used in combinations with headgear. The aim of this retrospective {{study was to investigate}} skeletal, dental and tegumental cephalometric modifications induced by Teuscher activator. This study was accomplished in a mixed dentition sample of Class II <b>malocclusions</b> subjects with mandibular retrognatism. This appliance was effective in treating growing patients with mandibular deficiency: the correction of Class II <b>malocclusions</b> was an arrangement of skeletal and dentoalveolar changes and leaded to the improvement of soft tissue facial profile...|$|R
30|$|In {{an early}} {{exploratory}} study, Vlaskalic and Boyd [25] concluded that Invisalign® {{may be more}} beneficial for patients in the permanent dentition with mild to moderate <b>malocclusions</b> after careful treatment planning.

50|$|<b>Malocclusions</b> may be {{coupled with}} {{skeletal}} disharmony of the face, where {{the relations between}} the upper and lower jaws are not appropriate. Such skeletal disharmonies often distort sufferer's face shape, severely affect aesthetics of the face, and may be coupled with mastication or speech problems. Most skeletal <b>malocclusions</b> can only be treated by orthognathic surgery.|$|R
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{long-term}} complications are {{loss of sensation}} in the mandibular nerve, <b>malocclusion</b> and loss of teeth {{in the line of}} fracture. [...] The more complicated the fracture (infection, comminution, displacement) the higher the risk of fracture.|$|E
2500|$|The {{evidence}} for linking <b>malocclusion</b> and/or crowding to dental caries is weak; however, {{the anatomy of}} teeth may affect the likelihood of caries formation.

40|$|Background: {{according}} to the World Health Organization, <b>malocclusions</b> are the third health problem in the world; consequently their detection and proper treatment are a priority. Objective: to evaluate the outcome of an educational intervention in children with <b>malocclusions</b> caused by oral habits. Methods: a quasi-experimental study involving 52 children with <b>malocclusions</b> was conducted in an elementary school in Cienfuegos from September 2010 through June 2011. First, the diagnosis was established; subsequently the Nice Smile Program was implemented {{on a weekly basis}} and finally, the results of the educational, preventive and therapeutic actions targeted at children, parents and educators were evaluated in order to reduce <b>malocclusions</b> and their clinical manifestations. Results: the level of awareness in children, parents and educators increased significantly, and 64. 6 % of dentomaxillofacial deformities (abnormal bilabial closure, increased overjet and open bite), was eradicated; hence, there was a reduction of children with <b>malocclusions.</b> Conclusion: the intervention was effective since it led to increased awareness about dentomaxillofacial deformities in children, parents and educators. In addition, it contributed to the eradication of this problem in children, and in general, to the improvement of the components of the stomatognathic system...|$|R

2500|$|Corruccini's {{long term}} {{research}} into the origins of <b>malocclusion</b> {{led him to the}} conclusion that not all cases could be solely attributed to genetic factors. In 1982, Corruccini and Beecher published the results of a study on squirrel monkeys that revealed that diet may {{play a significant role in}} occlusal health. Corruccini later asserted that the consumption of a western diet, or [...] "Industrial Diet" [...] may be one of the factors responsible for the swelling epidemic of malocclusions now appearing in modern human populations in western countries. Subsequent studies conducted by other scientists confirm the rise of malocclusions in modern humans.|$|E
2500|$|Occlusion {{is defined}} most simply as [...] "contacts between teeth", {{and is the}} meeting of teeth during biting and chewing. The term does not imply any disease. <b>Malocclusion</b> is a medical term {{referring}} to less than ideal positioning of the upper teeth relative to the lower teeth, which can occur both when the upper jaw is ideally proportioned to the lower jaw, or {{where there is a}} discrepancy between the size of the upper jaw relative to the lower jaw. <b>Malocclusion</b> of some sort is so common that the concept of an [...] "ideal occlusion" [...] is called into question, and it can be considered [...] "normal to be abnormal". An occlusal interference may refer to a problem which interferes with the normal path of the bite, and is usually used to describe a localized problem with the position or shape of a single tooth or group of teeth. A premature contact is one part of the bite meeting sooner than other parts, meaning {{that the rest of the}} teeth meet later or are held open, e.g., a new dental restoration on a tooth (e.g., a crown) which has a slightly different shape or position to the original tooth may contact too soon in the bite. A deflective contact/interference is an interference with the bite that changes the normal path of the bite. A common example of a deflective interference is an over-erupted upper wisdom tooth, often because the lower wisdom tooth has been removed or is impacted. In this example, when the jaws are brought together, the lower back teeth contact the prominent upper wisdom tooth before the other teeth, and the lower jaw has to move forward to allow the rest of the teeth to meet. The difference between a premature contact and a deflective interference is that the latter implies a dynamic abnormality in the bite.|$|E
2500|$|Speech sounds can be imitatively mapped into vocal articulations {{in spite}} of vocal tract anatomy {{differences}} in size and shape due to gender, age and individual anatomical variability. Such variability is extensive making input output mapping of speech more complex than a simple mapping of vocal track movements. The shape of the mouth varies widely: dentists recognize three basic shapes of palate: trapezoid, ovoid, and triagonal; six types of <b>malocclusion</b> between the two jaws; nine ways teeth relate to the dental arch and {{a wide range of}} maxillary and mandible deformities. [...] Vocal sound can also vary due to dental injury and dental caries. Other factors that do not impede [...] the sensory motor mapping needed for vocal imitation [...] are gross oral deformations such as hare-lips, cleft palates or amputations of the tongue tip, pipe smoking, pencil biting and teeth clinching (such as in ventriloquism). Paranasal sinuses [...] vary between individuals 20-fold in volume, and differ in the presence and the degree of their [...] asymmetry.|$|E
