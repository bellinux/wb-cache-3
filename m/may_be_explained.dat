5|$|Computer {{simulations}} of the dusty disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani {{suggest that the}} shape of the disk <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by the presence of a second planet, tentatively dubbed Epsilon Eridanic. Clumping in the dust disk may occur because dust particles are being trapped in orbits that have resonant orbital periods with a planet in an eccentric orbit. The postulated Epsilon Eridanic would orbit at a distance of 40AU, with an eccentricity of 0.3 and a period of 280 years. The inner cavity of the disk <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by the presence of additional planets. Current models of planet formation cannot easily explain how a planet could have been created at this distance from Epsilon Eridani. The disk is expected to have dissipated long before a giant planet could have formed. Instead, the planet may have formed at an orbital distance of about 10AU, then migrated outward because of gravitational interaction with the disc or with other planets in the system.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{extremely}} dense at this time—far denser than {{is usually}} required {{to form a}} black hole—the universe did not re-collapse into a black hole. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by considering that commonly-used calculations and limits for gravitational collapse are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as stars, and {{do not apply to}} rapidly expanding space such as the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|From {{national}} hospital admission databases {{it appears}} that the need for neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased markedly over the period between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed at least in part to the rising prevalence of obesity, although some of this increase <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by the increased popularity of shunting over optic nerve sheath fenestration.|$|E

The convict cichlids are more aggressive at 30°C as opposed to 26°C, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by the fact that convict cichlids tend to set up their breeding sites and spawn at 30°C.|$|E
5|$|Subarachnoid hemorrage due to {{arterial}} rupture typically occurs if the dissection extends {{into the}} V4 {{section of the}} artery. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> {{by the fact that}} the arterial wall is thinner and lacks a number of structural supports in this section.|$|E
5|$|The queen's pyramid complex {{had its own}} {{separate}} mortuary temple, {{which was}} located on {{the east of the}} pyramid in contrast to Userkaf's complex.

50|$|Three crows {{are also}} often {{implicated in the}} {{parliament}} of crows where three crows preside over {{a larger number of}} crows and sit in judgment over the fate of another crow. The verdict sometimes results in a crow being set upon by all the other crows. This behavior and their tendency to show up at battlefields and the scenes of murders <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>explain</b> the collective term for crows as being a 'murder of crows'.|$|R
3000|$|... 2. Of course, a {{mismatch}} of PET and histoPET before the MI coregistration <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by a tracer accumulation inconsistent to histopathologic findings {{which would then}} mislead the MI algorithm. However, good agreement of the rather complex patterns in PET and histoPET as determined with the MI algorithm suggests that this explanation is less likely for the present cases than {{a mismatch}} due to the various uncertainties described above. In our study, only anatomically plausible transformations below or around the FWHM of PET resolution occurred (Table 1) except for DefReg(MI) in patient 8. Such transformations <b>may</b> <b>be</b> easily <b>explained</b> by the limitation of the hardware coregistration of PET/CT.|$|R

5|$|Their {{longevity}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by {{the fact}} that the builders used a relatively dry mix of mortar and aggregate and compacted it by pounding it down to eliminate air pockets.

5|$|The {{difference}} in the hearing ranges for octopus and bigfin reef squids <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by the {{difference in}} their habitats. The octopus is demersal (bottom-dwelling) with excellent camouflage capabilities. Bigfin reef squids, on the other hand, are usually in open water with limited hiding places. Hearing would thus be {{more important for the}} squids to escape predators. The ability to hear is particularly relevant for avoiding mammalian predators of the suborder Odontoceti (particularly dolphins), who use echolocation to find prey.|$|E
5|$|During the 1965 {{parliamentary}} election Karmal {{was one of}} four PDPA members elected to the lower house of parliament; the three others were Anahita Ratebzad, Nur Ahmed Nur and Fezanul Haq Fezan. No Khalqists were elected; however, Amin was 50 votes short of being elected. The Parchamite victory <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by the simple fact that Karmal could contribute financially to the PDPA electoral campaign. Karmal became a leading figure within the student movement in the 1960s, electing Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal as Prime Minister after a student demonstration (called for by Karmal) concluded with three deaths under the former leadership.|$|E

On the night of 24–25 April 1915, in a first wave 235 to 270 Armenian leaders of Constantinople, clergymen, physicians, editors, journalists, lawyers, teachers, politicians, and others were arrested upon an instruction of the Ministry of the Interior. The differences in number <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by the uncertainties of the police as they imprisoned people with the same names.|$|E
5|$|The clumpy {{structure}} of the dust belt <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by gravitational perturbation from a planet, dubbed Epsilon Eridani b. The clumps in the dust occur at orbits that have an integer resonance with the orbit of the suspected planet. For example, {{the region of the}} disk that completes two orbits for every three orbits of a planet is in a 3:2 orbital resonance. In computer simulations the ring morphology can be reproduced by the capture of dust particles in 5:3 and 3:2 orbital resonances with a planet that has an orbital eccentricity of about 0.3. Alternatively, the clumpiness may have been caused by collisions between minor planets known as plutinos.|$|E
5|$|WASP-15 is a {{magnitude}} 11 star located about 1000 light-years {{away in the}} constellation Hydra. The star, which is more massive, larger, hotter, and more luminous than the Sun, is also less metal-rich than the Sun. WASP-15 has one known planet in its orbit, WASP-15b; the planet is a Hot Jupiter with an anomalously high radius, a phenomenon which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> {{by the presence of}} an internal heat source. The star was first observed by the SuperWASP program in 2006; future measurements in 2007 and 2008, as well as follow-up observations and analysis, eventually led to the discovery of WASP-15b using the transit method and Doppler spectroscopy.|$|E

5|$|Within the Solar System, the nucleon {{fraction}} of xenon is , for {{an abundance of}} approximately one part in 630thousand of the total mass. Xenon is relatively rare in the Sun's atmosphere, on Earth, and in asteroids and comets. The abundance of xenon in the atmosphere of planet Jupiter is unusually high, about 2.6 {{times that of the}} Sun. This abundance remains unexplained, but may have been caused by an early and rapid buildup of planetesimals—small, subplanetary bodies—before the heating of the presolar disk. (Otherwise, xenon would not have been trapped in the planetesimal ices.) The problem of the low terrestrial xenon <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by covalent bonding of xenon to oxygen within quartz, reducing the outgassing of xenon into the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Only three pitchers, Lefty Grove, Warren Spahn, and Early Wynn, {{joined the}} 300win club between 1924 and 1982, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> {{by a number}} of factors: the {{abolition}} of the spitball, World WarII military service, such as Bob Feller's, and the growing importance of the home run in the game. As the home run became commonplace, the physical and mental demands on pitchers dramatically increased, which led to the use of a four-man starting rotation. Between 1982 and 1990, the 300win club gained six members: Gaylord Perry, Phil Niekro, Steve Carlton, Nolan Ryan, Don Sutton and Tom Seaver. These pitchers benefited from the increased use of specialized relief pitchers, an expanded strike zone, and new stadiums, including Shea Stadium, Dodger Stadium and the Astrodome, that were pitcher's parks, which suppressed offensive production. Also, the increasing sophistication of training methods and sports medicine, such as Tommy John surgery, allowed players to maintain a high competitive level for a longer time. Randy Johnson, for example, won more games in his 40s than he did in his 20s.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to Hasan's rule {{outside of}} his family's core region around Mosul remained, however—in Diyar Bakr, the {{governor}} of Mayyafariqin, Ali ibn Ja'far, rebelled against Hasan, and in Diyar Mudar, the Qaysi tribes of the region around Saruj also revolted. Hasan subdued them and secured control over the entire Jazira {{by the end of}} 936, due to the efforts of his brother Ali, who was given the governorship of the two provinces as a reward. In the meantime, the defeated Banu Habib, some 10,000 strong and under the leadership of al-Ala ibn al-Mu'ammar, left their lands and fled to territory controlled by the Byzantine Empire. This unprecedented move <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> by the fact that {{a significant portion of the}} tribe still practised Christianity, or by pressure upon their grazing lands by tribes from the south, but the primary goal of the move was to escape from Hamdanid authority and taxation. Hasan also attempted to extend his control to Sajid-ruled Azerbaijan in 934 and 938, but his efforts failed.|$|E
