5|$|Heavier {{suburban}} {{traffic on the}} Melbourne network saw a greater strain on the block working then used, which required {{a large number of}} manned signal boxes to enable trains to run close together. As a result, it was decided to adopt power signalling under the Automatic Block System (ABS) of safeworking, where the presence of trains automatically control the signals after them, providing a safe distance between trains. Introduced from 1915, the system was based on American speed signalling practice with GRS2A upper quadrant <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> with two arms able to indicate up to 5 different speed aspects to train drivers. These signals were later replaced by colour light signals which are the standard today, but the old mechanical style remained until 2001.|$|E

25|$|When {{the coal}} yard closed, the {{opportunity}} was also taken {{to close the}} signal box. All pointwork was removed and <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> were replaced by colour lights controlled by Ketton signal box. Ketton signal box was retained due {{to the need to}} monitor the level crossing.|$|E

50|$|When {{stimulation}} from a sound {{reaches the}} ear, the eardrum deflects in a mechanical fashion, {{and the three}} middle ear bones (ossicles) transmit the <b>mechanical</b> <b>signal</b> to the cochlea, where hair cells transform the <b>mechanical</b> <b>signal</b> into an electrical signal. The auditory nerve, also called the cochlear nerve, then transmits action potentials to the central auditory nervous system.|$|R
25|$|There is a <b>mechanical</b> <b>signal</b> box to {{the north}} west of the station.|$|R
25|$|In {{the middle}} ear, {{the energy of}} {{pressure}} waves is translated into mechanical vibrations by the three auditory ossicles. Pressure waves move the tympanic membrane which in turns moves the malleus, the first bone of the middle ear. The malleus articulates to incus which connects to the stapes. The footplate of the stapes connects to the oval window, {{the beginning of the}} inner ear. When the stapes presses on the oval window, it causes the perilymph, the liquid of the inner ear to move. The middle ear thus serves to convert the energy from sound pressure waves to a force upon the perilymph of the inner ear. The oval window has only approximately 1/18 the area of the tympanic membrane and thus produces a higher pressure. The cochlea propagates these <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> as waves in the fluid and membranes, and then converts them to nerve impulses which are transmitted to the brain.|$|E
2500|$|The {{signal cabin}} {{included}} a fully interlocking McKenzie and Holland 37-lever mechanical signal frame (still extant). Before railway [...] "safeworking" [...] systems were computerised and centralised in Queensland, <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> were controlled from signal cabins, which {{dealt with the}} traffic on a particular block of railway line. Signal cabins coordinated signals that indicated {{whether or not a}} section of track was clear of other traffic. Early signals were mechanical, while later signals were operated electrically. The most common form of mechanical signal was the semaphore signal. These consisted of a metal framed tower with one or more arms that could be inclined at different angles, with the arm at the horizontal signalling [...] "danger", or do not proceed. Examples of this form of signalling system survive at Kuranda Station. At night, lights were necessary, and kerosene lamps with movable coloured spectacles displayed different colours, including green (proceed), yellow (prepare to find next signal red), and red (stop).|$|E
2500|$|In {{orthopedic}} surgery, PMMA {{bone cement}} {{is used to}} affix implants and to remodel lost bone. It is supplied as a powder with liquid methyl methacrylate (MMA). Although PMMA is biologically compatible, MMA {{is considered to be}} an irritant and a possible carcinogen. PMMA has also been linked to cardiopulmonary events in the operating room due to hypotension. Bone cement acts like a grout and not so much like a glue in arthroplasty. Although sticky, it does not bond to either the bone or the implant, it primarily fills the spaces between the prosthesis and the bone preventing motion. A disadvantage of this bone cement is that it heats up to [...] while setting that may cause thermal necrosis of neighboring tissue. A careful balance of initiators and monomers is needed to reduce the rate of polymerization, and thus the heat generated. A major consideration when using PMMA cement is the effect of stress shielding. Since PMMA has a Young's modulus between 1.8 and 3.1 GPa, which is lower than that of natural bone (around 14 GPa for human cortical bone), the stresses are loaded into the cement and so the bone no longer receives the <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> to continue bone remodeling and so resorption will occur.|$|E

50|$|While rare, some {{traditional}} signal boxes {{can still be}} found. Some still control <b>mechanical</b> points and <b>signals,</b> although in many cases, the lever frame has been removed or is out of use, and a control panel or VDU has been installed.

Both in the UK and Ireland, however, <b>mechanical</b> <b>signalling</b> is still relatively common away from the busiest lines; in Europe, {{there is also a}} considerable amount in Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic.

50|$|Amplifiers, in {{the most}} generic definition, are {{intermediate}} elements that increase the magnitude of a signal. These generally include, {{but are not limited}} to, mechanical amplifiers, electrical/electronic amplifiers, hydraulic/fluidic amplifiers, pneumatic amplifiers, optical amplifiers and quantum amplifiers. The purpose of employing a mechanical amplifier is generally to magnify the <b>mechanical</b> <b>signal</b> fed into a given transducer such as gear trains in generators or to enhance the <b>mechanical</b> <b>signal</b> output from a given transducer such as diaphragm in speakers and gramophones.|$|R

50|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> {{produced}} by rotating or reciprocating machines are remarkably well modelled as cyclostationary processes. The cyclostationary family accepts all signals with hidden periodicities, {{either of the}} additive type (presence of tonal components) or multiplicative type (presence of periodic modulations). This {{happens to be the}} case for noise and vibration {{produced by}} gear mechanisms, bearings, internal combustion engines, turbofans, pumps, propellers, etc.The explicit modelling of <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> as cyclostationary processes has been found useful in several applications, such as in noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) and in condition monitoring. In the latter field, cyclostationarity has been found to generalize the envelope spectrum, a popular analysis technique used in the diagnostics of bearing faults.|$|E

40|$|To {{define the}} {{cellular}} and molecular mechanisms for the osteogenic response of bone to increased loading, several key steps must be defined: sensing of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>signal</b> by cells in bone, transduction of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>signal</b> to a biochemical one, and transmission of that biochemical signal to effector cells. Osteocytes {{are likely to}} serve as sensors of loading, probably via interstitial fluid flow produced during loading. Evidence is presented {{for the role of}} integrins, the cell's actin cytoskeleton, G proteins, and various intracellular signaling pathways in transducing that <b>mechanical</b> <b>signal</b> to a biochemical one. Nitric oxide, prostaglandins, and insulin-like growth factors all play important roles in these pathways. There is growing evidence for modulation of these mechanotransduction steps by endocrine factors, particularly parathyroid hormone and estrogen. The efficiency of this process is also impaired in the aged animal, yet what remains undefined is at what step mechanotransduction is affected...|$|R
50|$|Biosignals {{may also}} refer to any non-electrical signal that {{is capable of}} being {{monitored}} from biological beings, such as <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> (e.g. the mechanomyogram or MMG), acoustic signals (e.g. phonetic and non-phonetic utterances, breathing), chemical signals (e.g. pH, oxygenation) and optical signals (e.g. movements).|$|E
50|$|Chondrocytes {{sense and}} convert the <b>mechanical</b> <b>signals</b> they receive into {{biochemical}} signals, which subsequently direct and mediate both anabolic (matrix building) and catabolic (matrix degrading) processes.
