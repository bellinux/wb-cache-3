40|$|Acoustic {{communication}} is highly {{influential in the}} expression of social behavior by anuran amphibians, transmitting information about the individual's physical condition and motivation. We studied the phonotactic (approach movements) responses of wild and captive male golden <b>mantella</b> <b>frogs</b> to conspecific wild and captive playback calls to determine the impact of captivity on social behaviour mediated by vocalisations. Calls were recorded from one wild and two captive populations. Phonotaxis experiments were then conducted by attracting M. aurantiaca males across a PVC grid {{on the forest floor}} or enclosure floor to a speaker. For each playback, the following parameters were recorded to define the accuracy of phonotaxis: (1) number of jumps; (2) jump angles; (3) jump distances; (4) path straightness. During this experiment we observed that wild frogs had a similar behavioural (phonotaxis) response to calls independent of their source while frogs from Chester Zoo had a significantly stronger response to calls of other conspecifics held separately at Chester Zoo. The lack of appropriate phonotaxis response by captive bred frogs to the calls of wild conspecifics could have serious negative conservation implications, if the captive bred individuals were released back to the wild...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With {{more than}} 250 species, the Mantellidae {{is the most}} species-rich family of frogs in Madagascar. These frogs are highly diversified in morphology, ecology and natural history. Based on a {{molecular}} phylogeny of 248 mantellids, we here examine the distribution of three characters reflecting the diversity of eye colouration and two characters of head colouration along the mantellid tree, and their correlation with the general ecology and habitat use of these frogs. We use Bayesian stochastic character mapping, character association tests and concentrated changes tests of correlated evolu-tion of these variables. We confirm previously formulated hypotheses of eye colour pattern being significantly correlated with ecology and habits, with three main character associations: many tree frogs of the genus Boophis have a bright col-oured iris, often with annular elements and a blue-coloured iris periphery (sclera); terrestrial leaf-litter dwellers have an iris horizontally divided into an upper light and lower dark part; and diurnal, terrestrial and aposematic <b>Mantella</b> <b>frogs</b> have a uniformly black iris. Furthermore, {{the presence of a}} frenal streak and a dark tympanic patch were associated with each other, with horizontally divided iris colour, and with terrestrial habits. Our study is restricted to the mantellid radia-tion, and the performed tests detect the simultaneous distribution of independent character states in a tree, rather tha...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Brightly colored Malagasy poison <b>frogs,</b> <b>Mantella</b> spp., {{sequester}} lipophilic, basic alkaloids from arthropod prey {{for their}} own chemical defense. Consequently, microsympatric prey diversity is expected to influence alkaloid diversity observed in poison frogs. Twenty-two specimens of three Mantella species from four localities in moist forests of southeastern Madagascar were analyzed individually via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, revealing that they contain over 80 known alkaloids. Frogs within a locality possessed significantly similar alkaloid content and diversity, while frogs from areas that varied in disturbance, elevation, and/or species showed greater differences. Based on dietary data, the larger <b>frog</b> species <b>Mantella</b> baroni consumed more and larger prey, and showed greater diversity in skin alkaloids than significantly smaller <b>Mantella</b> bernhardi. Additionally, <b>frogs</b> from the most pristine locality had {{the greatest number of}} alkaloids, whereas individuals from the most disturbed localities had the least. In a comparison of frog alkaloid profiles over a 10 - to 14 -yr period, alkaloid turnover, and thus presumably alkaloid-source arthropod turnover, was high in a disturbed locality and low in the pristine primary forest locality. We demonstrate that the nonlethal transcutaneous amphibia...|$|R

40|$|With few exceptions, aposematically colored {{poison frogs}} {{sequester}} defensive alkaloids, unchanged, from dietary arthropods. In the Neotropics, myrmicine and formicine ants and the siphonotid millipede Rhinotus purpureus are dietary sources for alkaloids in dendrobatid poison frogs, yet the arthropod sources for <b>Mantella</b> poison <b>frogs</b> in Madagascar remained unknown. We report GC-MS analyses of extracts of arthropods and microsympatric Malagasy poison <b>frogs</b> (<b>Mantella)</b> collected from Ranomafana, Madagascar. Arthropod sources for 11 “poison frog” alkaloids were discovered, 7 {{of which were}} also detected in microsympatric Mantella. These arthropod sources include three endemic Malagasy ants, Tetramorium electrum, Anochetus grandidieri, and Paratrechina amblyops (subfamilies Myrmicinae, Ponerinae, and Formicinae, respectively), and the pantropical tramp millipede R. purpureus. Two of these ant species, A. grandidieri and T. electrum, were also found in Mantella stomachs, and ants represented the dominant prey type (67. 3 % of 609 identified stomach arthropods). To our knowledge, detection of 5, 8 -disubstituted (ds) indolizidine iso- 217 B in T. electrum represents the first izidine having a branch point in its carbon skeleton to be identified from ants, and detection of 3, 5 -ds pyrrolizidine 251 O in A. grandidieri represents the first ponerine ant proposed as a dietary source of poison frog alkaloids. Endemic Malagasy ants with defensive alkaloids (with the exception of Paratrechina) are not closely related to any Neotropical species sharing similar chemical defenses. Our results suggest convergent evolution for the acquisition of defensive alkaloids in these dietary ants, {{which may have been}} the critical prerequisite for subsequent convergence in poison frogs between Madagascar and the Neotropics...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the degree {{and distribution of}} the genetic variation, and phylogeography, of two species of Malagasy poison <b>frogs,</b> <b>Mantella</b> cowani and M. baroni. The former is critically endangered due to its restricted distribution, habitat destruction and overcollection for the pet trade. Analysis of 526 bp of mtDNA (cytochrome b) resulted in separate haplotype networks for the two species, and discovered hybridization at a single locality. The two networks confirm the status of M. baroni and M. cowani as separate evolutionary species and units for conservation. Within both mitochondrial haplotype networks, specimens from different localities shared numerous identical haplotypes, even those from the most distant sample sites of M. baroni. Most populations were characterized by high haplotype diversity and no hap-lotype clades exclusive to geographical regions were observed. Protection of a few large populations of these species is therefore likely to conserve much of the mtDNA genetic diversity found in the entire species. WhileM. baroni is widespread and occurs in many nature reserves, we recommend efficient legal protection of some M. cowani habitats to protect this species against extinction...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic {{disturbance}} via resource acquisition, habitat {{fragmentation and}} climate change, amongst other factors, {{has led to}} catastrophic global biodiversity losses and species extinctions at an accelerating rate. Amphibians are currently {{one of the worst}} affected classes with at least a third of species categorised as being threatened with extinction. At the same time, they are also critically important for many habitats and provide man with a powerful proxy for ecosystem health by acting as a bioindicator group. Whilst the causes of synchronised amphibian losses are varied recent research has begun to highlight a growing role that macroparasites are playing in amphibian declines. However, diagnosing parasite infection in the field can be problematic, principally relying on collection and euthanasia of hosts, followed by necropsy and morphological identification of parasites in situ. The current study developed a non-invasive PCR-based methodology for sensitive detection and identification of parasitic nematode DNA released in the faeces of infected amphibians as egg or tissue fragments (environmental DNA). A DNA extraction protocol optimised for liberation of DNA from resilient parasite eggs was developed alongside the design of a novel, nematode universal, degenerate primer pair, thus avoiding the difficulties of using species specific primers in situations where common parasite species are unknown. Used in conjunction this protocol and primer pair was tested {{on a wide range of}} faecal samples from captive and wild amphibians. The primers and protocol were validated and detected infections, including a Railletnema nematode infection in poison dart frogs from ZSL London Zoo and <b>Mantella</b> cowani <b>frogs</b> in the wild. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of our PCR-based protocol for detecting nematode infection in other hosts, such as the presence of pinworm (Aspiculuris) in two tortoise species and whipworm (Trichuris muris) in mice. Our environmental DNA approach mitigates problems associated with microscopic identification and can be applied to detect nematode parasitoses in wild and captive hosts for infection surveillance and maintenance of healthy populations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The genus <b>Mantella,</b> endemic poison <b>frogs</b> of Madagascar with 16 {{described}} species, {{are known}} {{in the field of}} international pet trade and entered under the CITES control for the last four years. The phylogeny and phylogeography of this genus have been recently subject of study for conservation purposes. Here we report on the studies of the phylogeography of the Mantella cowani group using a fragment of 453 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from 195 individuals from 21 localities. This group is represented by five forms: M. cowani, a critically endangered species, a vulnerable species, M. haraldmeieri, and the non-threatened M. baroni, M. aff. baroni, and M. nigricans. Results The Bayesian phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses revealed the presence of three separated haplotype clades: (1) M. baroni, M. aff. baroni, M. nigricans, and putative hybrids of M. cowani and M. baroni, (2) M. cowani and putative hybrids of M. cowani and M. baroni, and (3) M. haraldmeieri. The putative hybrids were collected from sites where M. cowani and M. baroni live in sympatry. Conclusion These results suggest (a) a probable hybridization between M. cowani and M. baroni, (b) a lack of genetic differentiation between M. baroni/M. aff. baroni and M. nigricans, (c) evidence of recent gene-flow between the northern (M. nigricans), eastern (M. baroni), and south-eastern (M. aff. baroni) forms of distinct coloration, and (d) the existence of at least three units for conservation in the Mantella cowani group. </p...|$|R
