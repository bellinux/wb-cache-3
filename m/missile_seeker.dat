50|$|Herschel Matheny and Dr. Steve Gilbert founded Dynetics in 1974. During the 1980s, Dynetics {{expanded}} to include electro-optic and infrared sensors, missile systems analysis and design, software development, modeling and simulation, and foreign material exploitation of radars, <b>missiles,</b> and <b>missile</b> <b>seekers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Marotta {{provides}} several mission-critical {{controls for}} today’s complex weapon systems on land, {{in the air}} and at sea. Weapon systems include high pressure pneumatic ejection systems, control actuation systems, IR <b>missile</b> <b>seeker</b> cooling systems and a wide variety of power electronics.|$|E
50|$|This {{is opposed}} to older {{infrared}} homing missiles which were only able to track the hot engine exhaust of an aircraft if the aircraft's engine exhaust was pointing towards the <b>missile</b> <b>seeker,</b> and thus were only successfully used in tail-chase engagements.|$|E
50|$|In 1969, TI won the Harpoon (<b>missile)</b> <b>Seeker</b> contract. In 1986 TI won the Army FGM-148 Javelin fire-and-forget man {{portable}} {{anti-tank guided missile}} in {{a joint venture with}} Martin Marietta. In 1991 TI was awarded the contract for the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW).|$|E
40|$|Active radar seekers {{have gained}} wide {{applications}} in the terminal phase of missile guidance to provide hit-to-kill capability. Till recently, coherent monopulse tracker configurations were being used extensively for air-to-air <b>missile</b> <b>seekers</b> as well as surface-to-air <b>missile</b> <b>seekers,</b> while special real-beam technique-based seekers have been employed in antiship and land-attack systems. In this paper, features of active radar seekers have been described against different targets and background conditions {{to bring out the}} fact that the seeker design is highly applicationspecific in nature. The emerging trends in radar seeker technology have been identified wrt ever-changing threat scenario coupled with newer electronic countermeasure techniques, including the latest developments in components, subsystems, as well as implementation aspects...|$|R
50|$|The {{system uses}} an active method of jamming of {{infrared}} <b>missile</b> <b>seekers</b> through the sensor aperture. The {{system can be}} placed in either active or standby mode. In the standby mode the aircrew must select the active mode to begin jamming IR threats.|$|R
50|$|Sofradir’s MCT IR {{detectors}} {{are being}} used by space agencies to observe deep space, observe the Earth, monitor the environment, and provide data on meteorological phenomena.

50|$|KS-1: The initial {{version with}} a SJ-202 {{engagement}} radar, which adopts a simple horn {{instead of a}} lens arrangement, the <b>missile</b> <b>seeker</b> has a traditional parabolic antenna, and can guide up to two missiles against one target. Range is in excess of 40 km. The KS-1 resembles the US SM-1 or SM-2 Standard.|$|E
50|$|This is the {{slant range}} between the launch {{aircraft}} and target {{at the time}} that the missile begins active guidance or acquires the target with the missile's active seeker. The greater the A-Pole means less time and possibly greater distance that the launch aircraft needs to support the missile guidance until <b>missile</b> <b>seeker</b> acquisition.|$|E

5000|$|The Chaparral {{system is}} {{manually}} fired by visually tracking the targets, slewing the missile carrier {{into the general}} direction, {{and waiting for the}} <b>missile</b> <b>seekers</b> to [...] "lock on" [...] to the target. It is not suitable for engaging helicopters [...] "popping up" [...] behind cover, for instance.|$|R
50|$|As IR seeking {{technology}} has improved and diversified, standard IRCM systems have become less effective at defeating heat-seeking missiles. Measures such as flares {{have begun to}} give way to lasers, which, when fitted on a directional pivoting mount, allow for more effective, concentrated and energy-efficient directional targeting of IR radiation at incoming <b>missile</b> <b>seekers.</b>|$|R

50|$|In the post-WWII era, {{the term}} became more {{widely used in}} {{connection}} to missile guidance concepts. Many modern anti-aircraft missiles use some form of semi-active radar homing, where the <b>missile</b> <b>seeker</b> listens for reflections of the launch platform's main radar. To provide a continual signal, the radar is locked-onto the target, following it throughout the missile's flight.|$|E
50|$|The SARH system {{determines the}} closing {{velocity}} using the flight path geometry shown in Figure 1. The closing velocity {{is used to}} set the frequency location for the CW receive signal shown {{at the bottom of}} the diagram (spectrum). Antenna offset angle of the missile antenna is set after the target is acquired by the <b>missile</b> <b>seeker</b> using the spectrum location set using closing speed. The <b>missile</b> <b>seeker</b> antenna is a monopulse radar receiver that produces angle error measurements using that fixed position. Flight path is controlled by producing navigation input to the steering system (tail fins or gimbaled rocket) using angle errors produced by the antenna. This steers the body of the missile to hold the target near the centerline of the antenna while the antenna is held in a fixed position. The offset angle geometry is determined by flight dynamics using missile speed, target speed, and separation distance.|$|E
50|$|Infrared {{guidance}} {{systems in}} heat-seeking missiles {{are designed to}} track strong sources of infrared radiation - heat - such as aircraft engines, helping missiles to home in on their targets. IRCM systems {{are based on a}} modulated source of infrared radiation with a higher intensity than the target itself. When a <b>missile</b> <b>seeker</b> observes this modulated radiation, it interferes with or obscures the modulated signal from the aircraft and renders the missile incapable of maintaining a lock on the target.|$|E
50|$|The ZM-87 Portable Laser Disturber is a Chinese {{electro-optic}} countermeasure {{neodymium laser}} device. The ZM-87 was primarily intended to blind humans {{but was also}} reported to damage the photo-electric elements in laser rangefinders, videocameras and <b>missile</b> <b>seekers.</b> Roughly 22 of the devices were produced by the company Norinco before production ceased in 2000 {{as a result of}} the 1995 United Nations Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons ban.|$|R
50|$|All Air-to-Air Stinger (ATAS) Block II {{missiles}} will {{be modified}} existing Stinger RMP missiles (FIM-92C). Block II will incorporate various improvements {{including a new}} staring IR focal plane array seeker, a new battery, and advanced signal processing capabilities. The seeker permits engagements of helicopters in clutter out to the 8 km maximum physical range of the missile, also improved accuracy and IRCCM capabilities, and will provide a full night capability. The Block II <b>missile</b> also supports <b>seeker</b> slaving (steering the <b>missile's</b> <b>seeker</b> off-axis before launch to lock onto targets). This was first demonstrated on 6 November 1997 at Yuma.|$|R
50|$|Early {{short-range}} missiles such as {{the early}} Sidewinders and K-13 (missile) (AA-2 Atoll) had infrared seekers with a narrow (30-degree) field of view and required the attacker to position himself behind the target (rear aspect engagement). This meant that the target aircraft only had to perform a slight turn to move outside the <b>missile</b> <b>seeker's</b> field of view and cause the missile to lose track of the target ("break lock").|$|R
5000|$|The Q7 fire button {{launched}} the Bomarc, {{and an additional}} Q7 algorithm automatically directed the missile during climb and cruise {{to the beginning of}} its supersonic dive on the target when guidance transferred to the <b>missile</b> <b>seeker</b> system for the homing dive. Later improvements allowed transmission of Q7 guidance to autopilots of manned fighters for vectoring to targets via the SAGE Ground to Air Data Link Subsystem (cf. bomber vectoring to a Bomb Release Point in 1965-1973 Vietnam via vacuum-tube analog computers.) ...|$|E
50|$|Simpson was {{a mission}} {{director}} and project pilot for captive flight test activities beginning in 1988 before taking over as Director of Flight Operations in 1993 for the Integration, Test and Analysis Laboratory at Hughes Missile Systems. As a systems test pilot she flew the T-39 Sabreliner and Douglas A-3 Skywarrior {{in support of}} <b>missile</b> <b>seeker</b> technology development for Hughes Aircraft and Raytheon Missile Systems. In addition she flew numerous large transport category aircraft, light multi-engine and single engine aircraft modified for missile flight test purposes.|$|E
50|$|The {{superior}} low altitude {{performance of}} the weapon, and its new CW semi-active <b>missile</b> <b>seeker</b> resulted in a much higher success rate compared to the earlier SA-2 and SA-3 systems. While exact losses continue to be disputed, more than 40 A-4 Skyhawk Israeli aircraft are confirmed lost to SAM shots, and more than 62 F-4 Phantom Israeli aircraft are confirmed shot down by 2K12/SA-6, SA-2 SA-3 SAM systems. The 2K12 / SA-6 proved most effective of the three weapons, but later its performance declined as captured examples resulted in effective counter-measures being developed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>missile's</b> <b>seeker</b> is only {{capable of}} {{tracking}} the hot exhaust of aircraft, which limits the engagements to tail-chase only. The missile's blast fragmentation warhead is triggered by an impact fuze requiring a direct hit. As a first generation missile it is susceptible to countermeasures including flares and hot brick jammers. Its inability to turn at a rate greater than 3 G means {{that it can be}} outmaneuvered if detected.|$|R
5|$|The Tornado GR1B was a {{specialised}} anti-shipping {{variant of}} the GR1. A total of 26 were converted, which were based at RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland, replacing the Blackburn Buccaneer. Each aircraft was equipped to carry up to four Sea Eagle anti-ship missiles. At first the GR1B lacked the radar capability to track shipping, instead relying on the <b>missile's</b> <b>seeker</b> for target acquisition, later updates allowed target data to be fed from aircraft to missile.|$|R
50|$|On the downside, the SARH concept {{also meant}} that any other {{reflections}} could confuse the <b>missile's</b> <b>seeker.</b> Since SARH relied on making the <b>seeker</b> in the <b>missile</b> {{as simple as possible}} in order to fit into the missile body, it was common for seekers of the era to be easily confused by reflections from trees, buildings or the ground. It was difficult for the missile to distinguish the target in a cluttered environment.|$|R
50|$|The {{contrast}} seeker had {{a number}} of operational problems as well. Because of the environment they flew in, contrast seekers were generally not suitable to launch from helicopters, which led to experiments using wire guidance (TOW) or laser homing (Hellfire). Ultimately these systems proved suitable for launch from many types of platforms, and laser guidance in particular has become more widespread. These systems, however, often use the same basic tracking system as part of the laser designator system on the aircraft, keeping the camera or FLIR roughly pointed at the locked target in the same way it worked in the <b>missile</b> <b>seeker.</b>|$|E
5000|$|For launch, the <b>missile</b> <b>seeker</b> was slaved to {{the launch}} aircraft's radar (Ferranti AIRPASS in the Lightning and GEC AI.18 in the Sea Vixen) until lock was {{achieved}} and the weapons was launched, leaving the interceptor free to acquire another target. A downside {{was that the}} missile was highly toxic (due to either the Magpie rocket motor or the ammonia coolant) and RAF armourers had to wear some form of CRBN protection to safely mount the missile onto an aircraft. [...] "Unlike modern 1990s missiles, ... Firestreak could only be fired outside cloud, and in winter, skies were rarely clear over the UK." ...|$|E
50|$|DIRCM, or Directional Infrared Countermeasures, {{avoid this}} {{potential}} drawback by mounting the energy source on a movable turret (much like a FLIR turret). They only operate when cued by a missile warning system of a missile launch, {{and use the}} missile plume to accurately aim at the <b>missile</b> <b>seeker.</b> The modulated signal can then be directed at the seeker, and the modulation scheme can be cycled to try to defeat a variety of seekers. Countermeasure success depends on a threat's tracking techniques and requires a proper analysis of the missile's capabilities. Defeating advanced tracking systems requires {{a higher level of}} DIRCM power. Issues of Laser Safety are also taken into account.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{would then}} pull {{away at a}} sharp angle from the flare (and the terminal trajectory of the missile) and reduce engine power in attempt to cool the thermal signature. Optimally, the <b>missile's</b> <b>seeker</b> head is then confused by this change in temperature and flurry of new signatures, and therefore follows the flare(s) rather than the aircraft. The most modern IR-guided missiles have sophisticated on-board electronics that help discriminate between flares and targets, reducing the effectiveness of countermeasures.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The technique of proportional navigation {{is applied to}} a three dimensional missile-target engagement model. A Luenberger observer is developed to reduce the effects of noise or jamming to the <b>missile's</b> <b>seeker</b> head. A ground observer which computes the deviations in target position and velocity and uplinks the deviations to the missile is also evaluated using the Kalman Filter theory to determine {{the benefits of the}} additional information provided to the missile.

Attention is presently given to results obtained for these FPAs' current-voltage characteristics, {{as well as for}} their characterization at different temperatures. The detector arrays were also mated to a multiplexer and characterized under different operating conditions. The unit cell size used is 52 x 52 microns...|$|R
