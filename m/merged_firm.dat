5|$|In 1934 the Cunard Steamship Company {{merged with}} the White Star Line to form Cunard White Star Line, which became the largest {{passenger}} steamship company in the world, helping to make Liverpool {{one of the most}} important centres of the British trans-Atlantic ocean liner industry. The Cunard building subsequently acted as the central headquarters for the newly <b>merged</b> <b>firm,</b> with both administrative and ship-designing facilities located within the building. Many ships and liners were developed and designed at the Cunard Building, including the RMS Queen Mary and RMS Queen Elizabeth. Given that Liverpool was a major trans-Atlantic port and due to the building's proximity to the River Mersey, the lower floors of the Cunard Building were allocated to provide space for cruise liner passengers, both prior to and after sailing. Within the building there were passenger facilities including separate waiting rooms for first, second and third class passengers, a booking hall, luggage storage space, and a currency exchange. The building also provided facilities for both land and sea based Cunard employees. During the Second World War, the sub-basement level of the Cunard Building was used as an air raid shelter for workers in the building and also for those from adjacent premises. The basement levels also served as the central Air Raid Precautions headquarters for the City of Liverpool during the war. Additional reinforced steel joists were fitted to further strengthen the basement in case of a direct hit on the building.|$|E

[...] Despite the firm's name, Burnham was the nominal survivor; the Drexel name only came {{first at the}} insistence of the more {{powerful}} investment banks, whose blessing was necessary for the <b>merged</b> <b>firm</b> to inherit Drexel's position as a [...] "major" [...] firm. [...] Milken {{was one of the few}} prominent holdovers from the Drexel side of the merger, and became the merged firm's head of convertibles. [...] He persuaded his new boss, fellow Wharton alumnus Tubby Burnham, to let him start a high-yield bond trading department—an operation that soon earned a 100% return on investment. By 1976, Milken's income at what was now Drexel Burnham Lambert was estimated at $5 million a year.|$|E
2500|$|Inside PGP Inc., {{there was}} still concern about patent issues. RSADSI was {{challenging}} {{the continuation of the}} Viacrypt RSA license to the newly <b>merged</b> <b>firm.</b> The company adopted an informal internal standard they called [...] "Unencumbered PGP" [...] which would [...] "use no algorithm with licensing difficulties". [...] Because of PGP encryption's importance worldwide, many wanted to write their own software that would interoperate with PGP 5. Zimmermann became convinced that an open standard for PGP encryption was critical for them and for the cryptographic community as a whole. In July 1997, PGP Inc. proposed to the IETF that there be a standard called OpenPGP. They gave the IETF permission to use the name OpenPGP to describe this new standard as well as any program that supported the standard. The IETF accepted the proposal and started the OpenPGP Working Group.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{post-acquisition}} operating performance of <b>merged</b> <b>firms</b> using {{a sample of}} the 50 largest mergers between U.

The results indicate that <b>merged</b> <b>firms</b> have significant improvement in asset productivity relative to their industries after the merger, leading to higher post-merger operating cash flow returns. Sample firms maintain their capital expenditure and R&D rates relative to their industries after the merger, indicating that <b>merged</b> <b>firms</b> do not reduce their long-term investments. There is a strong positive relation between postmerger increases in operating cash flows and abnormal stock returns at merger announcements, indicating that expectations of economic improvements underlie the equity revaluations of the <b>merging</b> <b>firms.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the output and profit effects of horizontal mergers between up-stream firms in intermediate-goods markets. We consider market settings {{in which the}} upstream firms sell differentiated products to a downstream retail monopolist. We find that if the <b>merging</b> <b>firms</b> can bundle their products, transfer pricing is efficient {{before and after the}} merger. The <b>merging</b> <b>firms</b> gain and the retailer loses, but absent any cost efficiencies, consumer and total welfare do not change. If the <b>merging</b> <b>firms</b> cannot bundle their products, the effects of the merger depend on the <b>merged</b> <b>firm’s</b> bargaining power. If the <b>merged</b> <b>firm’s</b> bargaining power is low, the welfare effects are the same as in the case with bundling; if its bargaining power is high, and there are no offsetting cost efficiencies, the merger typically reduces welfare. We evaluate the profit effects of merg-ers on the rival firms and retailer for the case of two-part tariff contracts. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that a merger that harms the retailer may increase welfare...|$|R

30|$|<b>Merging</b> <b>firms</b> often {{negotiate}} hard to {{find the}} right organization design, i.e., one that reaps combination benefits from the merger. It is thus essential for firms to understand gains and costs of their integration choices in the specific context of the acquisition. <b>Merging</b> <b>firms,</b> both acquirer and target, need to find internal alignment on the motivation behind an acquisition, such as leveraging knowledge or capabilities, and choose the level of integration accordingly (Puranam and Srikanth 2007), before defining the degree of structural integration.|$|R
30|$|To further unpack the PMI decision, <b>merging</b> <b>firms</b> have to {{make two}} {{organizational}} choices: groupings (units, departments) and linking across groupings (vertical reporting, dedicated liaisons, temporary task forces) (Puranam and Vanneste 2016).

The more firms move towards full absorption, the higher the grouping and linking activities across <b>merging</b> <b>firms.</b> On the independence-absorption continuum, one should observe a broad set of configurations of linking-grouping activities. Furthermore, the choice of geographic or physical location can reinforce or weaken the benefits of integration choices.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} model of mergers and {{acquisitions}} based on stock market misvaluations of the combining firms. The key ingredients of the model are the relative valuations of the <b>merging</b> <b>firms,</b> the horizons of their respective managers, and the market’s perception of the synergies from the combination. The model explains who acquirers whom, whether the medium of payment is cash or stock, what are the valuation consequences of mergers, and why there are merger waves. The model is consistent with available empirical findings about characteristics and returns of <b>merging</b> <b>firms,</b> and yields new predictions as well. ...|$|R

30|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, {{the existing}} literature on PMI generally seeks to answer {{one of the following}} questions: Which resources or units do <b>merging</b> <b>firms</b> reconfigure post-acquisition?

Interesting new research questions could particularly stem from integrating the fragmented fields of research on PMI.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyses}} the {{profitability of}} horizontal mergers in a Stackelberg model {{and their impact on}} welfare when there is uncertainty about the marginal costs of the newly <b>merged</b> <b>firms.</b> The authors consider that the <b>merging</b> <b>firms</b> decide their production strategy knowing the actual value of the production cost, while outsiders are a priori uncertain about the exact amount of cost efficiency/inefficiency that will result from the merger. Nevertheless, the key element of the model is that the merged entity can signal its own cost to some rivals (outsider-followers) when it behaves as a leader; while all outsiders remain uninformed when it behaves as a follower. They show that when there is role redistribution, the <b>merging</b> <b>firms</b> always have incentives to merge, irrespective of cost uncertainty, while a merger without role redistribution is ex ante profitable if and only if uncertainty is sufficiently great. As regards the social desirability of mergers, it is found that a merger between leaders always enhances welfare if participants have incentives to merge, such that private and collective interests coincide. Nevertheless, a merger with role redistribution leads to conflict between private and collective interests...|$|R
