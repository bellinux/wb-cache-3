Following the Michelin interpretation of the Import-Export Clause, the U.S. Supreme Court re-examined its application of the dormant commerce clause doctrine in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, which related to interstate commerce and established a four-prong test in which a tax is valid if it [...] "is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the services provided by the State." [...] In Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, the U.S. Supreme Court had occasion to consider {{the application of the}} dormant commerce clause doctrine to foreign commerce. In addition to the four-prong test in Complete Auto Transit, the court added two prongs derived from the Import-Export Clause: whether the tax creates a risk of <b>multiple</b> <b>taxation</b> and whether it impairs the federal government's one voice in dealing with foreign nations. The dormant commerce clause is important in complementing the Import-Export Clause (which only prohibits [...] "imposts" [...] and [...] "duties"), since the former also prohibits discriminatory regulations. In West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v.

40|$|An {{alternative}} {{minimum tax}} (AMT) is often regarded as desirable. We analyze a wealth tax at corporate and personal level that is designed as an AMT as proposed by the German Green Party. This wealth tax is imputable to profit taxes and is hence intended to prevent <b>multiple</b> (multistage) <b>taxation.</b> Referring to data from annual reports and the German Central Bank we model enterprises of different structure, industry, size and legal status. We show that companies {{in the service sector}} which generally maintain rather high gearing rates are more frequently subjected to the wealth tax than capital intensive industries. This result runs counter to well-known effects of a common wealth tax. Capital intensive firms, e. g. in the metal industry, are levied with definitive wealth tax only if they have large loss carry-forwards or extremely volatile profits. Furthermore, partnerships often enjoy wealth tax privileges due to uniform taxation at individual level whereas corporations may suffer from the wealth tax at corporate and personal level caused by imputation backlogs. Obviously, the underlying AMT influences corporate dividend policy evoking a push-out effect. We prove that this kind of wealth taxation usually favors financial rather than real investment and encourages outbound investment. Consequently, introducing an AMT discriminates against many firms and investment projects, especially if economic income is lower than taxable income. This proves that whenever income is taxed correctly, AMT is dispensable. [...] {{alternative minimum tax}},business strategy,investment decisions,wealth tax...|$|R

40|$|This study, {{the role}} of small and medium sized {{enterprises}} for economic growth, was undertaken {{to find out how}} SME sub-sector in Nigeria has performed {{and its impact on the}} economic growth of the country. Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) is accepted globally as a tool for empowering the citizenry and economic growth. It has been associated with the rapid economic growth of countries in Asia and North America. In Nigeria efforts have been made by successive governments to reduce poverty and accelerate economic growth by increasing foreign direct investment, diversifying the economy, enacting policy frameworks which favour small business ownership and sometimes initiating employment and entrepreneurship programmes. Specifically this study tends to figure out: how profitable SME business is; whether infrastructural development could be attributed to the presence of SMEs; if significant number of people are employed within the SME sector; whether the SME market has attracted banks and financial institutions with increase in loans and incentives; whether there is increase in information Technology related businesses due to presence of SMEs and if there is need for the government to encourage and develop more opportunities for SMEs. A total of 200 SMEs were randomly selected from Matori, a city in Lagos state Nigeria. A questionnaire was constructed and distributed to the selected SMEs. The responses were collated and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) analytical tool. The study reveals that while SME businesses are profitable problems of policy inconsistency and poor infrastructural development continuously undermine the potentials of the market. Though the presence of SMEs has attracted infrastructural development, such developments in most cases are community effort or privately driven which limits the amount of developments achieved. For example their efforts could be limited to patching and maintaining existing bad road networks but not expanding or creating new road networks. The study also revealed that financial institutions like banks are attracted to areas where SMEs are established but getting funds through these institutions via loans has not been easy due to high interest rates and harsh conditions like types of collateral to present. It was also established that SMEs are good employers of labor but not without required support and facilities. SMEs will not engage more people to work for them when their businesses do not thrive. For their businesses to thrive they need government to encourage them and develop more opportunities such opportunities could be in terms of providing infrastructures like stable power supply and good transport networks (rails and roads), easy access to finance (low interest rates), stable government policies, reducing <b>multiple</b> <b>taxations,</b> ensuring availability and access to modern technology and raw materials locally etc. The result of the study confirms existing theories in the field which support the belief that SMEs remains a tool for economic growth in Nigeria. There are enormous potentials and opportunities for SMEs in Nigeria to mature and play the crucial role of economy growth, poverty reduction, employment and wealth creation. This will entail having the government provide required supports and addressing identified problems. While the SMEs also need to change their attitudes relating to entrepreneurship development, government needs to involve the SMEs in policy formulation and execution for maximum effect.

40|$|Both in the {{developed}} and developing world, decentralization of fiscal policy is frequently argued to foster investment, because allowing investors to choose between competing locations should {{make it difficult for}} each jurisdiction to tax the investment's returns.

40|$|The {{unpredictability of}} the Supreme Court’s dormant Commerce Clause (“DCC”) {{jurisprudence}} continues to draw trenchant criticism from commentators and the Justices themselves, as the Court remains unable to explain which state taxes and subsidies impede interstate commerce. We show that these {{problems can be}} resolved by a Commerce Neutrality framework requiring that state taxes and subsidies provide a combined treatment of inbound and outbound transactions at least as favorable as their treatment of intrastate transactions. This simple test has an economic foundation because taxes and subsidies that violate it create incentives to engage in intrastate rather than interstate transactions. The Supreme Court recently took an important step toward implementing this framework in Maryland Comptroller v. Wynne, 135 S. Ct. 1787 (2015), when it invalidated Maryland’s income tax scheme based on economic analysis similar to that presented in this article. The simple Commerce Neutrality condition resembles the Court’s oft-used, but poorly explained, internal consistency test. At the same time, Commerce Neutrality simplifies DCC jurisprudence by sweeping away the Court’s flawed call for equal treatment of out-of-state and in-state parties (as opposed to equal treatment of interstate and intrastate transactions), its half-hearted concern about <b>multiple</b> <b>taxation,</b> and its ill-defined concept of external consistency. And, because Commerce Neutrality applies to subsidies on the same terms as taxes, it eliminates the tax-subsidy confusion that has figured so prominently in analyses of the DCC.
