Handicrafts include woven <b>mats</b> <b>and</b> baskets, wooden utensils of simple design, carved stools, pottery, musical instruments, tanned skins, and wood products. The balafon, similar to a xylophone, is made out of the horns of animals. Innovative designs include butterfly wings stuck with gum on paper, and ebony and hardwood carvings of wood from the tropical region. Artwork also covers carved animals and human figures. The crafts center in Bangui provides training to about 100 students in artistic crafting in leather, ivory and ebony wares.|$|E
5|$|The Magyars buried their dead, {{laying the}} {{deceased}} {{on their backs}} with the arms resting along their bodies or upon their pelvises. A deceased warrior's tomb always contained material connected with his horse. These are most frequently its skin, skull, and the lower legs; these were put into its master's grave, but occasionally only the harness was buried together with the warrior, or the horse's skin was stuffed with hay. The Magyars rolled the corpses in textiles or <b>mats</b> <b>and</b> placed silver plates on the eyes and the mouth.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{although}} D. discoideum generally reproduces asexually, D. discoideum {{is still}} capable of sexual reproduction if certain conditions are met. D. discoideum has three different mating types and studies have identified the sex locus that specifies these three mating types. Type I strains are specified by the gene called MatA, Type II stains have three different genes: MatB (homologous to Mat A), <b>Mat</b> C, <b>and</b> <b>Mat</b> D, <b>and</b> Type III strains have <b>Mat</b> S <b>and</b> <b>Mat</b> T genes (which are homologous to <b>Mat</b> C <b>and</b> <b>Mat</b> D).

5|$|The {{ground floor}} of the two-story 306ft long {{building}} contained a clothing factory, dry cleaning plant, furniture plant, brush factory, and an office, where prisoners of the federal penitentiary could work for money. They earned a small wage for their labour which was put into an account, known as a Prisoner's Trust Fund, which would be given to them upon leaving Alcatraz. They made items such as gloves, furniture <b>mats,</b> <b>and</b> army uniforms. The laundry room occupied the entire upper floor, the largest in San Francisco at the time. Each window has 9 panes and there are 17 bays on each floor on either side.|$|E
5|$|Farming villagers in {{the north}} spent their days {{harvesting}} crops like wheat and millet, while farmers south of the Huai River engaged in intensive rice cultivation and had lakes and ponds where ducks and fish could be raised. The cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and tea bushes could be found mostly south of the Yangzi River; even further south sugarcane and citrus were grown as basic crops. Some people in the mountainous southwest made a living by selling lumber from hard bamboo. Besides cutting down trees to sell wood, the poor also made a living by turning wood into charcoal, and by burning oyster shells to make lime and fired pots, and weaving <b>mats</b> <b>and</b> baskets. In the north traveling by horse and carriage was most common, while in the south the myriad of rivers, canals, and lakes provided cheap and easy water transport. Although the south had the characteristic of the wealthy landlord and tenant farmers, there were on average many more owner-cultivators north of the Huai River due to harsher climate, living not far above subsistence level.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{the venue}} was {{upgraded}} for €1 million by installing a K60 inrun between the normal and large hill. This allowed the medium inrun {{to use the}} same outrun as the normal hill. In 2008, a small K25 hill, named Ninoufbakken, was installed slightly away from the main hills. The venue's certificate was due to expire in 2011, after which the venue would have to meet the International Ski Federation's (FIS) latest regulations. A €1.5 million upgrade program was initiated, which saw the inruns renovated, including installation of the Ski-Line track system and new Porsgrund ceramic tracks. The outruns saw new plastic <b>mats</b> <b>and</b> a new sprinkler system. The Nordic House, a sports centre, was also built. Construction started on the normal hill in May 2011 and on the large hill in August 2011, with completion scheduled for early 2012.|$|E

5|$|Schnauzers have a {{specific}} groom cut that is standard among the Schnauzer breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show dogs), or by clipping (a short-cut usually reserved for family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into <b>mats</b> <b>and</b> curls.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of the Soak Zone was originally an island known as Flower Island, until part of the surrounding lake was filled in. Under previous names {{it was called the}} H20hhh Zone and later Dr. Hydro's Soak Zone. The area originally consisted of just the pool and bathhouse, until slides were first added in 1985. A raft ride, Rafter's Run, was added the next year. The water park has since been expanded to include body slides, inner-tube slides, a slide with foam <b>mats,</b> <b>and</b> many features for children, including a miniature pool and Captain Kidd's Adventure Galley, a play area added in 2006. The swimming pool was replaced by a heated wave pool in 2011. The addition was the park's single-largest capital improvement. For the 2013 season the park added a lazy river and an expanded beach area.|$|E
5|$|The LRDG {{vehicles}} were mainly two wheel drive, chosen {{because they were}} lighter and used less fuel than four wheel drive. They were stripped of all non-essentials, including doors, windscreens and roofs. They were fitted with a bigger radiator, a condenser system, built up leaf springs for the harsh terrain, wide, low pressure desert tyres, sand <b>mats</b> <b>and</b> channels, plus map containers and a sun compass devised by Bagnold. Wireless trucks had special compartments built into the bodywork to house wireless equipment. Initially the LRDG patrols were equipped with one Canadian Military Pattern (CMP) Ford 15 cwt F15 truck for the commander, {{while the rest of}} the patrol used up to 10 Chevrolet 30 cwt wide-body (WB) trucks. From March 1941 the 30 cwt Chevrolets were replaced by the CMP Ford 30 cwt F30, although in some ways this was a retrograde step; because they were four wheel drive and heavier than the Chevrolets, they used twice as much fuel, which in turn reduced the range of a patrol. From March 1942 the Fords were progressively replaced by 200 Canadian Chevrolet 1533 X2 30 cwts, which had been specially ordered for the LRDG. From July 1942 Willys Jeeps began to be issued for the patrol commander and patrol sergeant.|$|E

5|$|The Mikea {{live in a}} {{symbiotic}} relationship with the neighboring Masikoro farmers and herders, and the Vezo fishing clan. The Mikea live primarily on food scavenged from the forest but also grow seasonal crops. Their mobility and reliance on scavenging as opposed to crop growing shifts in response to changes in environmental and economic pressures on availability of resources within the Mikea {{community as well as}} those of their Vezo and Masikoro neighbors. The Mikea sell their forest products, as well as woven <b>mats</b> <b>and</b> food animals they raise, at weekly Vezo and Masikoro markets in nearby villages to obtain the necessities they cannot scavenge, such as clothing and medicine. Some Mikea migrate for periods of time to work in local villages or the town of Morombe. They are also hired to work for Vezo and Masikoro villagers, such as by cutting forest for villagers or other Mikeas' corn fields, or guarding villagers' zebu herds. They occasionally acquire one or more zebu in addition to or in lieu of payment, as these are seen as a form of wealth and are mainly sacrificed in ancestral ceremonies rather than eaten as food. The rainy season is the time when Mikea are most likely to leave their scavenging encampments for wage labor opportunities in villages or for the corn harvest. This is also the time when Masikoro and Vezo villagers are most likely to move into the forest to grow corn.|$|E

Study design: We examined 78 patients with PWS-like phenotype who lacked molecular defects for PWS. The MEG 3 methylation test followed by microsatellite polymorphism analysis of chromosome 14 was performed to detect upd(14) mat or other related abnormalities affecting the 14 q 32. 2 -imprinted region. Results: We identified 4 patients with upd(14) <b>mat</b> <b>and</b> 1 patient with an epimutation in the 14 q 32. 2 imprinted region. Of the 4 patients with upd(14) mat, 3 had full upd(14) <b>mat</b> <b>and</b> 1 was mosaic. Conclusions: Upd(14) <b>mat</b> <b>and</b> epimutation of 14 q 32. 2 represent clinically discernible phenotypes and should be designated 9 ̆ 3 upd(14) mat syndrome. 9 ̆ 4 This syndrome demonstrates a PWS-like phenotype particularly during infancy.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 Clay mineralogy, {{physical}} and chemical characteristics were studied in three sites of moist acidic tundra (<b>MAT)</b> <b>and</b> three sites in moist nonacidic tundra (MNT) in the Northern Sagwon Hills, Alaska. The major similarities found in physical characteristics between <b>MAT</b> <b>and</b> MNT were color, field texture and consistence. Dissimilarities were in the depth, boundary and thickness of the horizons as well as soil structure. The major similarities found in chemical characteristics across <b>MAT</b> <b>and</b> MNT were in % carbon and nitrogen, ammonium phosphorus, iron and aluminum contents. The major dissimilarities were in pH, cation exchange capacity, nitrate and base saturation. Upper horizon pH in MAT was lower than MNT while deeper horizons had similar pH's. The mean average annual soil temperature was around - 5 °C in both <b>MAT</b> <b>and</b> MNT. The most common clay minerals found were illite, vermiculite and kaolinite. Kaolinite {{was determined to be}} detrital, not neoformed. Vermiculite from weathered illite was determined to be the most significant weathering product. The study also determined that the proportion of vermiculite to illite was higher in <b>MAT</b> <b>and</b> the illite to vermiculite proportion was higher in MNT.
