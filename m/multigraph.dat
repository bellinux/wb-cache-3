25|$|Several {{authors have}} made conjectures that {{imply that the}} {{fractional}} chromatic index of any <b>multigraph</b> (a number that can be computed in polynomial time using linear programming) is within one of the chromatic index. If these conjectures are true, {{it would be possible}} to compute a number that is never more than one off from the chromatic index in the <b>multigraph</b> case, matching what is known via Vizing's theorem for simple graphs.

40|$|Abstract. We characterise the quartic (i. e. 4 -regular) <b>multigraphs</b> {{with the}} {{property}} that every edge {{lies in a}} triangle. The main result is that such graphs are either squares of cycles, line <b>multigraphs</b> of cubic <b>multigraphs,</b> or are obtained from the line <b>multigraphs</b> of cubic <b>multigraphs</b> {{by a number of}} simple subgraph-replacement operations. A corollary of this is that a simple quartic graph with every edge in a triangle is either the square of a cycle or a graph obtained from the line graph of a cubic graph by replacing triangles with copies of K 1, 1, 3. 1...|$|R

The vertices of the <b>multigraphs</b> are unlabelled. Here, R denotes {{an arbitrary}} species of combinatorial structures used to ‘enrich’ the <b>multigraphs</b> by endowing {{the set of}} edges (or arcs) joining any pair (or ordered pair) of vertices with an R-structure. Examples include ordinary <b>multigraphs,</b> simple graphs, digraphs, cyclically or linearly enriched <b>multigraphs,</b> {{according to the choice}} of the enriching species R.

40|$|AbstractUsual edge colorings {{have been}} {{generalized}} in various ways; {{we will consider}} here essentially good edge colorings as well as equitable edge colorings. It is known that bipartite <b>multigraphs</b> present the property of having an equitable k-coloring for each k ⩾ 2. This implies that {{they also have a}} good k-coloring for each k ⩾ 2. In this paper, we characterize a class of <b>multigraphs</b> which may be considered as a generalization of bipartite <b>multigraphs,</b> in the sense that for each k ⩾ 2 they have a good k-coloring. A more restrictive class is derived where all <b>multigraphs</b> have an equitable k-coloring for each k ⩾ 2...|$|R
25|$|In {{category}} theory, a small category can {{be represented}} by a directed <b>multigraph</b> in which the objects of the category are represented as vertices and the morphisms as directed edges.

25|$|The {{idea of a}} {{spanning}} tree can be generalized to directed multigraphs. Given a vertex v on a directed <b>multigraph</b> G, an oriented {{spanning tree}} T rooted at v is an acyclic subgraph of G in which every vertex other than v has outdegree 1. This definition is only satisfied when the “branches” of T point towards v.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} the line graph of G may {{naturally}} be extended to the case where G is a <b>multigraph.</b> In this case, the characterizations of these graphs can be simplified: the characterization in terms of clique partitions no longer needs to prevent two vertices from belonging to the same to cliques, and the characterization by forbidden graphs has fewer forbidden graphs.|$|E
25|$|Other {{senses of}} graph stem from {{different}} {{conceptions of the}} edge set. In one more generalized notion, V is a set together with a relation of incidence that associates with each edge two vertices. In another generalized notion, E is a multiset of unordered pairs of (not necessarily distinct) vertices. Many authors call this type of object a <b>multigraph</b> or pseudograph.|$|E
25|$|Unless stated {{otherwise}} all graphs {{are assumed}} to be simple, in contrast to multigraphs in which two or more edges may connecting the same pair of endpoints and in which there may be self-loops.

For simple graphs, minimum semidefinite rank (msr) and minimum vector rank differ by exactly the number of isolated vertices. We explore the relationship between msr and mvr for <b>multigraphs</b> and show that a result linking the msr of chordal graphs to clique cover number also holds for the mvr of <b>multigraphs.</b> We study the difference between msr and mvr in the removal of duplicate vertices in <b>multigraphs,</b> and relate mvr to certain coloring problems...|$|R
25|$|A graph L is {{the line}} graph of some other graph or <b>multigraph</b> {{if and only if}} it is {{possible}} to find a collection of cliques in L (allowing some of the cliques to be single vertices) that partition the edges of L, such that each vertex of L belongs to exactly two of the cliques. It {{is the line}} graph of a graph (rather than a <b>multigraph)</b> if this set of cliques satisfies the additional condition that no two vertices of L are both in the same two cliques. Given such a family of cliques, the underlying graph G for which L is the line graph can be recovered by making one vertex in G for each clique, and an edge in G for each vertex in L with its endpoints being the two cliques containing the vertex in L. By the strong version of Whitney's isomorphism theorem, if the underlying graph G has more than four vertices, there can be only one partition of this type.|$|E
25|$|A cycle graph {{illustrates}} the various cycles {{of a group}} and is particularly useful in visualizing the structure of small finite groups. A cycle graph for a cyclic group is simply a circular graph, where the group order {{is equal to the}} number of nodes. A single generator defines the group as a directional path on the graph, and the inverse generator defines a backwards path. Trivial paths (identity) can be drawn as a loop but are usually suppressed. Z2 is sometimes drawn with two curved edges as a <b>multigraph.</b>|$|E
25|$|Open shop {{scheduling}} is {{a problem}} of scheduling production processes, in which there are a set of objects to be manufactured, each object has a set of tasks to be performed on it (in any order), and each task must be performed on a specific machine, preventing any other task that requires the same machine from being performed at the same time. If all tasks have the same length, then this problem may be formalized as one of edge coloring a bipartite <b>multigraph,</b> in which the vertices {{on one side of the}} bipartition represent the objects to be manufactured, the vertices on the other side of the bipartition represent the manufacturing machines, the edges represent tasks that must be performed, and the colors represent time steps in which each task may be performed. Since bipartite edge coloring may be performed in polynomial time, the same is true for this restricted case of open shop scheduling.|$|E

25|$|In fiber-optic communication, {{the path}} {{coloring}} {{problem is the}} problem of assigning colors (frequencies of light) to pairs of nodes that wish to communicate with each other, and paths through a fiber-optic communications network for each pair, subject to the restriction that no two paths that share a segment of fiber use the same frequency as each other. Paths that pass through the same communication switch but not through any segment of fiber are allowed to use the same frequency. When the communications network is arranged as a star network, with a single central switch connected by separate fibers to each of the nodes, the path coloring problem may be modeled exactly as a problem of edge coloring a graph or <b>multigraph,</b> in which the communicating nodes form the graph vertices, pairs of nodes that wish to communicate form the graph edges, and the frequencies that may be used for each pair form the colors of the edge coloring problem. For communications networks with a more general tree topology, local path coloring solutions for the star networks defined by each switch in the network may be patched together to form a single global solution.|$|E
