500|$|The album's {{guitar and}} bass {{ensemble}} was primarily dictated by Frusciante, {{rather than a}} collaborative effort between him and bassist Flea. Therefore, the record took different direction than any previous Chili Peppers' album. Frusciante sought to create an emotional and poignant soundscape throughout the recording. Drawing influences from musicians such as Vini Reilly of The Durutti Column and John McGeoch, Frusciante made use of textured and multilayered guitar progressions on By the Way, using tools such as the mellotron and various effects pedals throughout. In 2006, while promoting the band's subsequent studio album, Stadium Arcadium, Flea reflected on the composition of By the Way, stating: [...] "John went to this whole level of artistry. But he made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> had nothing to offer, like I knew shit." ...|$|E

Gonzalez liked LuPone's short guest spot, and {{hoped it would be}} [...] "a lesson to producers in how to deal with guest appearances in the future". Canning said the date had a [...] "sweet comical tone", and thought the episode was [...] "the best the series has done so far with this couple". Reiter felt Rachel was making a [...] "false" [...] choice in her refusal of Finn {{at the end of the}} date, and wondered [...] "couldn't she at least have asked him" [...] if he would consider coming to New York. At the competition performance, Poniewozik said of the end of [...] "Pretending", [...] "I may not be that invested in Finn/Rachel, but the startling moment where the audience disappeared in the middle of their kiss made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was." [...] Benigno called the moment [...] "awesome", and VanDerWerff was also pleased.|$|E

That experience made him feel like a [...] "mutant", {{and he says that}} was his lowest point. [...] "Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things like that are coming out of people's mouths. It made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> wasn't even in the room." [...] In April 2013, in {{a cover story}} for GQ magazine, Mars confessed that he changed his surname because people in the music industry took him as another Latino artist, and even tried to convince him to sing in Spanish saying: [...] "Your last name's Hernandez, maybe you should do the Latin music, this Spanish music... Enrique [...] is so hot right now”. Nevertheless, Mars used his childhood nickname Bruno and changed his surname to Mars, in an effort to [...] "avoid being stereotyped".|$|E

It just made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> if <b>I</b> was in any way desirable to the opposite sex that it was my fault, and it made me ashamed of my body and being a woman".|$|R
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics, with Rudd's {{performance and the}} various subplots being generally well-received, although some disliked the main mystery. Eric Goldman of IGN graded the episode a 7.8 out of 10, indicating that it was [...] "good". He generally praised Rudd's performance and the case-of-the week, but he was critical of its ending, stating that [...] "after last week, {{it was a bit}} too much of another 'and that's one to grow on' conclusion." [...] He was also mixed towards the episode's subplots, enjoying Mac's romantic storyline but disliking Logan's continued interest in Veronica. He also referred to Vinnie running for Sheriff as [...] "a bit ridiculous". Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on his blog What's Alan Watching?, lauded the episode, particularly Rudd's performance. He stated that Rudd, despite playing a stock character, [...] "made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> hadn't seen it a thousand times before." [...] He also enjoyed the pairing of Mac and Max, while he believed that the impact of Vinnie and Leo's reappearances was blunted by the knowledge that the show would likely not return for a fourth season. Television Without Pity graded the episode a [...] "B".|$|E
500|$|When [...] "Nothin' on You" [...] {{was being}} showed to {{different}} [...] "music industry decision-makers", {{one of those}} individuals tried to give the song to a [...] "blue-eyed blonde" [...] artist instead of Mars, due to his race. That experience made the singer feel like a [...] "mutant", reaching his lowest point so far in his career. Mars concluded, [...] "Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things like {{that are coming out}} of people's mouths. It made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> wasn't even in the room." [...] According to American record producer Jim Jonsin, Atlantic Records' chairman, Craig Kallman, wanted him to work on the track for Lupe Fiasco. However, Jonsin pressured Kallman to give the song to B.o.B. Lupe stated that Kallman told him his lyrics and performance on the record were [...] "wack". Lupe claimed that this repeated denigration from the label drove him to a breaking point, and to feel [...] "suicidal". Afterwards, his verses were removed and new ones were written by Mars and B.o.B. An unmixed version of the song with Fiasco's verses and Mars' vocals leaked later in the same year.|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} {{decided to keep}} {{publicity}} down during the recording of their fourth album, as the group was taken aback by such press surrounding Infinity on High. Sessions proved to {{be difficult for the}} band as Wentz started taking LSD when Zach Blair lead guitarist for Rise Against made him try it at a party in April 2008. The goal in Wentz using LSD was to hope it would influence his songwriting, but it just made him distracted from writing songs, which annoyed Stump, so he stopped using LSD in August 2008. Wentz later said he had taken LSD over 50 times. Stump called the making of the album [...] "painful", noting that he and Wentz quarreled over many issues, revealing [...] "I threw something across the room over a major-to-minor progression." [...] On previous albums, Trohman felt he and Hurley did not have enough musical freedom and that Stump and Wentz exerted too much control over the group: [...] "I felt, 'Man, this isn't my band anymore.' It's no one's fault, and I don't want to make it seem that way. It was more of a complex I developed based off of stuff I was reading. It's hard to hear, 'Joe and Andy are just along for the ride.'" [...] To amend the situation, Trohman sat down with Stump to communicate his concerns, which led to more collaboration on Folie à Deux. [...] "It made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> owned the songs a lot more. It made me really excited about contributing to Fall Out Boy and made me find my role in the band," [...] Trohman recalled.|$|E

I wrote it because I needed to remind myself that I believed in myself. No matter what, I still was gonna make music, even if it was on a small scale. Even if it was just for me." [...] She also said: [...] "I really challenged myself in writing {{the past couple of years}} to be vulnerable in my lyrics. I didn’t want to skate past what was hurting. It didn’t scare me to be vulnerable because I think that’s when you get something great." ...|$|R

2500|$|Although the {{suspects}} (except Salaam) had confessed on videotape {{in the presence}} of a parent or guardian, they retracted their statements within weeks, claiming that they had been intimidated, lied to, and coerced into making false confessions. The detectives had indeed used ruses to convince {{the suspects}} to confess, with Salaam confessing to having been present only after he was told that fingerprints were found on the victim's clothing. According to Salaam, [...] "I would hear them beating up Korey Wise in the next room", and [...] "they would come and look at me and say: 'You realise you're next.' The fear made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> really <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was not going to be able to make it out."

500|$|The {{tour of the}} United States faced various troubles. Ament {{said that}} the band and its crew had to [...] " [...] shows from the ground up, a venue {{everywhere}} we went." [...] In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at San Francisco, California's Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering {{from the effects of}} food poisoning. Vedder left the hospital to play the show, however {{he was not able to}} finish and ended up performing just seven out of twenty-one songs with the band. Neil Young filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, [...] "That whole [...] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [...] was there made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs." [...] Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, [...] "I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music." [...] Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} {{decided to keep}} {{publicity}} down during the album's recording, as they were taken aback by such press surrounding Infinity on High. Stump entered the studio with music for almost 50 songs. Folie à Deux {{was intended to be}} very different from the previous three Fall Out Boy albums, which were all interconnected musically and thematically; Stump described the new songs as [...] "having a lot of freedom [...] it's our first just plain old record in a while." [...] However, the sessions proved to be difficult for the band. Stump called the making of the album [...] "painful", noting that he and Wentz quarreled over many issues, revealing [...] "I threw something across the room over a major-to-minor progression."

Club Todd VanDerWerff {{gave it a}} [...] "B", {{and wrote}} that he [...] "finally got a sense that, yes, this second season has been {{building}} toward something and {{has been trying to}} tell an emotional story, as well as a humorous one. 'Born This Way', {{for the first time in}} a long time, made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> could say I was a fan of Glee without a million qualifiers." [...] Gary Mills of the Florida Times-Union felt that the episode didn't live up to its hype, but also said that he wasn't disappointed. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair reacted positively, and noted that by [...] "focusing on what makes these lovable dorks, well, lovable dorks—and not pop, or high-school, superstars—tonight's episode, if a bit tidily, reminded us that these are supposed to be kids". Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon thought that [...] "Born This Way" [...] was [...] "the show's best episode to date", and [...] "an epic about a hero returning from a long journey, walking serenely through halls that once scared him, and performing with such skill and sincerity that his friends stared at him with love and awe." [...] Aly Semigran of MTV had mixed emotions. She criticized the abrupt changes of the storylines in the episode, and thought that the episode [...] "was a noble effort" [...] but [...] "it didn't quite work the way it was supposed to." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal stated that the episode [...] "sounded just the perfect notes" [...] and called it [...] "the best episode yet". He continued: [...] "The night held wonderful gems: A clear message. Witty repartee (…). Great character build up. And tailored songs that carried emotional heft." ...|$|E

The video was shot {{on the grounds of}} the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine, where Axtman was an artist in {{residence}} in 2006. In an interview about Where's The Party At?, Axtman admitted: [...] "I really got into the historical meaning of burning a cross... When Ku Klux Klan burn it within their little crew of white people in little dresses, there’s such a meaning of spirituality and brotherhood and their white pride. Then they put it in black people’s yards to say 'I hate you nigger, get away.' So it has this really weird double meaning.
