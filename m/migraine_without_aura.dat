40|$|BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study {{revealed}} reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) {{values in the}} corpus callosum (CC) in <b>migraine</b> patients <b>without</b> <b>aura.</b> Abnormalities in white matter integrity, particularly in the CC, may affect inter-hemispheric resting state functional connectivity (RSFC). Unfortunately, relatively {{little is known about}} the alterations in functional interactions between the cerebral hemispheres during resting state in <b>migraine</b> patients <b>without</b> <b>aura,</b> and even less about how the inter-hemispheric RSFC are affected by the abnormalities of the CC. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Twenty-one <b>migraine</b> patients <b>without</b> <b>aura</b> and 21 healthy controls participated in this study, age-, sex-, and education-matched. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was employed to investigate the white matter alterations of the CC. Meanwhile, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) was used to compare the inter-hemispheric RSFC differences between the patients and controls. TBSS analysis revealed reduced FA values in the genu and the splenium of CC in patient group. VMHC analysis showed decreased inter-hemispheric RSFC of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in <b>migraine</b> patients <b>without</b> <b>aura</b> relative to that of the controls. Furthermore, in <b>migraine</b> patients <b>without</b> <b>aura,</b> the reduced FA values of the genu of CC correlated with the decreased inter-hemispheric RSFC of the ACC. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that the <b>migraine</b> patients <b>without</b> <b>aura</b> showed reduced FA values of the genu of CC and decreased inter-hemispheric RSFC of the ACC. The correlation between the above structural and functional changes suggested that the reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) of CC modulates inter-hemispheric VMHC in <b>migraine</b> patients <b>without</b> <b>aura.</b> Our results demonstrated that the VMHC alterations of ACC can reflect the FA changes of the genu of CC in <b>migraine</b> patients <b>without</b> <b>aura...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The ICHD-2 {{specifies}} {{two different}} forms of the previously-dubbed [...] "menstrual migraine": pure menstrual <b>migraine</b> <b>without</b> <b>aura</b> and menstrually-related <b>migraine</b> <b>without</b> <b>aura.</b> The sole difference between these diagnoses is the occurrence of headache attacks outside of the 5-day period described in the diagnostic criteria. If a woman experiences no attacks outside of this 5-day period, she may be diagnosed with pure menstrual migraine with aura; if she does experience other attacks, however, she may suffer from menstrually-related <b>migraine</b> <b>without</b> <b>aura.</b> This distinction is made solely for treatment purposes; a woman who only experiences migraines in that 5-day period is likely to benefit more from hormone therapy than a traditional migraine medication such as a triptan.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we aimed to assess the brain {{distribution}} of 5 -HT 1 A receptors in <b>migraine</b> patients <b>without</b> <b>aura.</b> Ten female <b>migraine</b> patients and 24 female healthy volunteers underwent magnetic resonance imaging and positron emis-sion tomography using a radioligand antagonist of 5 -HT 1 A receptors [4 -(2 ′-methoxyphenyl) - 1 -[2 ′-(N- 2 -pirydynyl) -p-fluorobenzamido]-ethylpiperazine (18 F-MPPF) ]. A simplified reference tissue model was used to generate parametric images of 5 -HT 1 A receptor binding potential (BP) values.

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} compute phase {{synchronization}} of the alpha band from a multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded under repetitive flash stimulation from <b>migraine</b> patients <b>without</b> <b>aura.</b> This allowed examination of ongoing EEG activity during visual stimulation in the pain-free phase of migraine. Methods: Flash stimuli at frequencies of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27 Hz were delivered to 15 <b>migraine</b> patients <b>without</b> <b>aura</b> and 15 controls, with the EEG recorded from 18 scalp electrodes, {{referred to the}} linked earlobes. The EEG signals were filtered in the alpha (7. 513 Hz) band. For all stimulus frequencies that we evaluated, the phase synchronization index {{was based on the}} Hilbert transformation. Results: Phase synchronization separated the patients and controls for the 9, 24 and 27 Hz stimulus frequencies; hyper phase synchronization was observed in patients, whereas healthy subjects were characterized by a reduced phase synchronization. These differences were found in all regions of the scalp. Conclusions: During migraine, the brain synchronizes to the idling rhythm of the visual areas under certain photic stimulations; in normal subjects however, brain regions involved in the processing of sensory information demonstrate desynchronized activity. Hyper- synchronization of the alpha rhythm may suggest a state of cortical hypoexcitability during the interictal phase of migraine.
