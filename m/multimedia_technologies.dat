40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the following: (a) the extent to which <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> is being integrated into College of Business Administration instructional practices; (b) the views that College of Business Administration faculty members hold regarding <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> integration into instructional practices; (c) the views of students enrolled in College of Business Administration courses regarding <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> integration into instructional practices; and (d) the extent to which <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> is available in the College of Business Administration for instructional practices. College of Business Administration faculty members and students enrolled in College of Business Administration courses at The University of Texas at El Paso were surveyed. Two instruments were used in this study for data collection purposes: (a) The Instructional Questionnaire: Teacher Survey, and (b) The Instructional Questionnaire: Student Survey. The evidence gathered supported all four research hypotheses. First, <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> has been and will continue to be incorporated into the instructional practices of College of Business Administration faculty members. Second, College of Business Administration faculty members have positive attitudes about the integration of <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> into their instructional practices. Third, College of Business Administration students have positive attitudes toward the integration of <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> into their classroom experiences. Fourth, <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology,</b> sufficient for integration into instructional practices, is available within College of Business Administration for faculty use. ^ There is approximately a 50 / 50 split between College of Business Administration faculty members using and not using <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> in the classroom. This lack of use is attributable to several factors: (1) faculty are not aware of the benefits of the integration of <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> into instructional practices; or (2) they have not received enough incentives to become trained in <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> use; or (3) they have become very comfortable with conventional teaching methods and have no desire to learn new ways of doing things; or (4) they are not concerned with student learning. ^ Results from the student questionnaire survey clearly demonstrated the important and positive impact that <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> has on teaching and learning and the positive attitudes that students hold toward the integration of <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> into their classroom experiences. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMultimedia {{technology}} as an advanced technology in audio-visual education program is applied {{more and more}} widely, with the advancement of times {{and the development of}} science and technology, such as in college physical education. Nowadays the wide use of <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> in college physical education changes traditional teaching method improves teaching effect and makes teaching procedure vivid. This paper discusses the application of <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> in college physical education by documentary method, professor interview, mathematical statistics etc. It shows that <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> has positive influence on college physical education, as it promotes scientific, advanced and vivid development of college physical education. However there are still problems in the application of <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> in college physical education, for example, the problem in the links between multimedia teaching and traditional teaching and in the great influence of courseware on teaching effect. So it's necessary to accelerate <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> development, strengthen the application of <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> in college physical education, achieve a proper cooperation between traditional and multimedia teaching, enrich multimedia courseware and its effect...|$|R
