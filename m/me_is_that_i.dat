500|$|In early 2010, it was {{announced}} that three new characters; Doug Harris (Mahesh Jadu), Michael Williams (Sandy Winton) and Natasha Williams were to join Neighbours in the following months. Novakovic, a performing arts college graduate, was cast in the role of Natasha. The actress had been studying architecture at university, before she chose to move into acting. Shortly after her casting {{was announced}}, Novakovic revealed that the role of Natasha was her first acting job and that while she would always be interested in architecture, she really wanted to enjoy the experience on Neighbours. Novakovic moved from Sydney to Melbourne, where Neighbours is filmed, for the role. She is three years older than the character she portrays. In 2011, Novakovic revealed she is still happy with the career choice she made, stating [...] "I enjoy what I'm doing now a lot more than studying, because this is where I want to be. [...] The best thing for <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> enjoy going to work every day and have some great friends there, including the crew. It's awesome to do something you love every single day." ...|$|E
500|$|For In the Zone, Spears {{worked with}} hit {{producers}} such as Bloodshy & Avant, R. Kelly, Diddy, Christopher Stewart, Moby, Guy Sigsworth and The Matrix. She first started writing songs for In the Zone during the Dream Within a Dream Tour. Spears commented about writing while touring, [...] "The {{only thing that}} was scary to <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't {{know if they were}} good. [...] You can’t trust anybody. You have to go with your feelings." [...] Spears commented that she was an autobiographical songwriter, although not to the point she felt self-exploited. Following the end of the tour, Spears invited her friend and backing vocalist Annet Artani to her home in Los Angeles. They started writing songs at the piano, and shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Among the tracks they worked on was [...] "Everytime", which Artani confirmed to be written as a response to Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", as well as [...] "Shine", written by Spears about her sister Jamie Lynn, which was left unfinished. Earnest recording of the album began in May 2003. Spears commented that although she did not know initially what direction she wanted to go with the album, she took time to work with different producers and to find those who she had chemistry with. The first song recorded for In the Zone was [...] "Touch of My Hand", and Spears said it [...] "really did provide a balance {{for the rest of the}} record. We just went from there." [...] Following the recording sessions for [...] "Everytime", Spears complimented Sigsworth, saying, [...] "I just basically told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell them things and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 13 July 2011, {{according}} to a leaked telephone surveillance transcript, Berlusconi told his presumed blackmailer Valter Lavitola: [...] "The only thing they can say about <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> screw around [...] Now they're spying on me, controlling my phone calls. I don't give a fuck. In a few months [...] I'll be leaving this shit country that makes me sick." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next best}} solution, {{it seemed to}} <b>me,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should walk home: and this I at once proposed.|$|R
60|$|The most {{surprising}} {{part of the}} whole thing to <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not feel in the least alarmed. If anything, I was rather pleased to see him. It was company.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, Benoit; {{somewhat}} nearer than I could wish. To own the truth, {{the reason}} you have not sooner seen <b>me</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> passing my time on board our old friend, la Proserpine. Her officers and crew would not lose my company, when they had once begun to enjoy it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{criticism}} of his passion about {{the coming of the}} Messiah and, his urging people to do all they could to bring about the redemption by adding in the observance of Torah and Mitzvahs, was something that was known to him. On one occasion he even remarked [...] "I have merited that the complaint people have against <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am passionate about the Mashiach." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having been {{introduced}} to Georgescu during {{the final stage of}} the critic's career, Manea retold one of his confessions from the time: [...] "I suppose what you heard about <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a Stalinist. I'm not a Stalinist, Mr. Norman, know that. I was with Leiba Trotsky." [...] Manea also wrote: [...] "What struck about [...] was the contradiction between the extraordinary mobility of spirit and the Affixed Idea. [...] How did he pacify his disappointments and regenerate his militantism after having seen with his eyes, and his mind, and his heart the nightmarish masquerade of the totalitarian state?" [...] He added: [...] "The socialist tension between the 'conserved' ideal and the putrid reality maintained in those who gave up neither contempt nor complicity a sort of narcissistic and megalomaniac blindness." ...|$|E
60|$|Wild. The {{worst that}} you can say of <b>me</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have loved you thrice over.|$|E
5000|$|Cannon's {{performance}} in the game was a main factor in his winning the Heisman Trophy {{at the end of}} the season. Cannon himself said, [...] "The thing that clinched the Heisman for <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> made a play or two in a big game." [...] A video of the punt return is still played on the big screen in Tiger Stadium before every home game.|$|R
2500|$|San Diego Republican mayor Jerry Sanders testified how he transitioned from believing <b>that</b> {{domestic}} partnership <b>was</b> an ideal compromise to believing <b>that</b> same-sex marriage <b>was</b> fundamental. [...] "What hit <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> prejudiced", he explained. During cross-examination, {{he agreed with}} the defendants that not all {{people who voted for}} Proposition 8 were [...] "bigots", but that he believed their vote was [...] "grounded in prejudice".|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> cannot say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{have turned}} out the great {{business}} man <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> when I began life. But I am comparatively young yet, and may learn. I am rather inclined to believe <b>that</b> what troubled <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> got the big-head early in the game. I want to explain to you a few points of difference between the principles of business as I see them and those that Mr. Cannon believes in.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Cashel, unabashed, [...] "the {{only use}} of all that to <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may marry if I like. No more {{fighting}} or teaching now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be so, Disco, {{but that}} is only what may be styled the don't side of the question. What {{troubles}} <b>me</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't see much on the do side of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can only}} say 'Thank you!' though that doesn't go far enough," [...] he said. [...] "What makes the thing seem more to <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> haven't the least call on one of you." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sheldon Talmy {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois, United States, and {{from an early age}} he was {{interested}} both in music—early rock, rhythm and blues, folk music, and country music as well as technology. At 13 Talmy appeared regularly on the popular NBC-TV television show Quiz Kids, a question-and-answer program out of Chicago. He told Chris Ambrose of Tokion Magazine, [...] "What it did for <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> absolutely knew <b>that</b> this <b>was</b> the business I wanted to be in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>be</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{know exactly}} what it is I have to decide," [...] he proceeds. [...] "Suppose I insist on reading the letter--?" ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> {{remember}} <b>that</b> {{the sick}} had no {{trust in the}} beginning because they thought <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{took part in the}} mass murdering. <b>I</b> must say <b>that</b> in their place, I would have had the same impression. I was locked up without interruption, couldn't go anywhere alone, and all they knew about <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> lived there where they murdered so many people. Additionally, the prisoners saw when I entered the washroom in the case of Schikovsky; they heard the woman scream and therefore assumed <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> part of the murder.|$|R
60|$|As for the City Bard, or Knight Physician, I {{hear his}} quarrel to <b>me</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was the author}} of Absalom and Achitophel, which he thinks is a little hard on his fanatic patrons in London.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{have plenty}} of time after leaving here to-night; but what bothers <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may have a row with Sam Barney, 'cause I ain't goin' to let him swell 'round borrowin' money on my account." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As for the City Bard, or Knight Physician, I {{hear his}} quarrel to <b>me</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was the author}} of 'Absalom and Achitophel,' which he [...] thinks, is a little hard on his fanatic patrons in London.|$|E
60|$|I {{have but}} one thing to say, either to obviate or to answer such an objection, if it shall <b>be</b> made to <b>me,</b> which <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> loved Mr Dryden.|$|R
6000|$|Nigel looked wistfully at the Frenchman; but {{he shook}} his head. [...] "Alas! it may not be," [...] said he. [...] "The last words that Sir Robert said to <b>me</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to bring you to his side, for he would have speech with you. Would <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could do what you ask, for I also have a fair lady to whom I would fain send you. What use <b>are</b> you to <b>me,</b> Raoul, since I have gained no honor in the taking of you? How is it with you now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have taken}} the ground from beneath my feet," [...] he declared. [...] "Your opinion of <b>me</b> <b>is</b> such <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{hesitate}} to proceed {{at all in the}} matter which I desired to discuss with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{always say}} that," [...] she said. [...] "I assure you it's a common 'combination,' {{as you call}} it, in the houses of the clergy. The only thing that's odd about <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> enjoy them both--Emerson and the stocking." ...|$|E
60|$|Maybe {{you think}} I am not happy? {{the very thing}} that gravels <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am. I don't want to be happy when I can't work; I am {{resolved}} that hereafter I won't be. What I have always longed for, was the privilege of living forever away up on one of those mountains in the Sandwich Islands overlooking the sea.|$|E
6000|$|MAZZINI [humbly]. I {{think that}} what is the matter with <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am poor. You don't {{know what that means}} at home. Mind: I don't say they have ever complained. They've all been wonderful: they've been proud of my poverty. They've even joked about it quite often. But my wife has had a very poor time of it. She has been quite resigned-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady-killer!" [...] he snorted. [...] "Why, Miss Mason, I don't mind {{telling you}} <b>that</b> I've sure <b>been</b> scairt of women all my life. You're {{the first one}} I've not <b>been</b> afraid of. <b>That's</b> the strange thing about it. I just plumb worship you, and yet I'm not afraid of you. Mebbe it's because you're {{different}} from the women I know. You've never chased me. Lady-killer! Why, I've been running away from ladies ever since I can remember, and <b>I</b> guess all <b>that</b> saved <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> strong {{in the wind and}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never fell down and broke a leg or anything.|$|R
5000|$|So, what {{happened}} to <b>me</b> <b>is</b> so terrible <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{might as well be}} dead.|$|R
5000|$|Actor Andrew J. West {{addresses}} Gareth's {{presence in}} the episode, saying: [...] "I read that script and when I got the last couple pages, I was just shocked — but in a good way. I was smiling from ear to ear. All Scott Gimple had told <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in episode two. I kept reading and got to the final pages and my God. I'm {{a fan of the}} comic book, too, so <b>that</b> <b>was</b> informing what <b>I</b> was reading and I recognized certain things. But it was a huge surprise and a pleasant one at <b>that</b> for <b>me</b> to <b>be</b> able to get to do something like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{troubles}} <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't mean it when I began, and {{was going}} to use the dear girl as an instrument of torture for Nan. It wasn't right, and I don't deserve to be so happy. If all my scrapes ended as well as this, what a state of bliss I should be in!' and Tom beamed again at the rapturous prospect.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{are quite}} right; {{he was not}} that. But we will not talk of this branch of the subject. By far the most serious concern with <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ought to do some good by marriage, or by heroic {{performance}} of some kind; while going back to give the rudiments of education to remote hamleteers will do none of you any good whatever.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It wos pritty hardish," [...] said Ben, with a smile, an' {{made the}} stars sparkle {{in my brain}} {{for all the world}} like the rory borailis, as I've see'd so often in the {{northern}} skies; but it's all in the way o' trade, so I don't grumble; the only thing as bothers <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't git my hat rightly on by reason of the bump.|$|E
6000|$|Otterson {{looked over}} his {{shoulder}} to explain, despairingly: [...] "The trouble with <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> do get a chance to talk English, there's such a flow of language it carries me away, and I don't know just where I'm landing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{were pretty}} well matched," [...] he said, [...] "and I suppose were equally {{surprised}} {{when we found}} each other grappling in the dark. Of course neither of us knew how many supporters the other had close at hand, but the first thought <b>that</b> struck <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must silence him if possible before his comrades came to his assistance. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> only afraid <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should not <b>be</b> able to shake myself free from his grip so as {{to get to his}} throat, but fortunately he relaxed his hold the moment he felt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had loosened mine, and as I was on the top of him the rest was easy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to America," [...] Tom replied, [...] "and may not be back for years. Yes, those are my sisters, and what upsets <b>me</b> most <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have to leave them all alone, for we have lost both our parents." ...|$|R
