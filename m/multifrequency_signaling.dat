Results of simulations and example of measurement are evaluated for monofrequency signals. For non-coherent signal sampling a new and effective approach to RMS value measurement in time domain, a new method of finding exact signal frequency (different from those of DFT grid) based on two DFT phase spectra computation, and a method of automatic RMS value bias correction in frequency domain are presented.

These sequences give rise to frequency-coded signals of a specific structure characterized by nonuniform distribution of the number of subpulses over the frequencies.

40|$|Piezoelectric-stack {{actuated}} platforms {{are very}} popular in the parlance of nanopositioning with myriad applications like micro/nanofactory, atomic force microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, wafer design, biological cell manipulation, and so forth. Motivated by the necessity to improve trajectory tracking in such applications, this paper addresses the problem of rate dependent hysteretic nonlinearity in piezoelectric actuators (PEA). The classical second order Dahl model for hysteresis encapsulation is introduced first, followed by the identification of parameters through particle swarm optimization. A novel inversion based feedforward mechanism in combination with a feedback compensator is proposed to achieve high-precision tracking wherein the paradoxical concept of noise as a performance enhancer is introduced {{in the realm of}} PZAs. Having observed that dither induced stochastic resonance in the presence of periodic forcing reduces tracking error, dither capability is further explored in conjunction with a novel output harmonics based adaptive control scheme. The proposed adaptive controller is then augmented with an internal model control based approach to impart robustness against parametric variations and external disturbances. The proposed control law has been employed to track <b>multifrequency</b> <b>signals</b> with consistent compensation of rate dependent hysteresis of the PEA.

With the advent of <b>multifrequency</b> <b>signals</b> from more Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs), the opportunity arises to construct many more ionosphere-sensing combinations of GNSS data. With such diversity, various estimable ionospheric delays with differing interpretations (and of different precision) can be formed. How such estimable ionospheric delays should be interpreted, {{and the extent to which}} they contribute to the precision with which the unbiased TEC can be estimated, are the topics of this paper. Based on multifrequency GNSS code-only, phase-only, and phase-and-code data, we derive the closed-form solutions of different types of ionospheric observables that each can serve as input of an externally provided ionospheric model for TEC determination. Within such a general least-squares framework, we generalize the widely used phase-to-code levelling technique to its multifrequency version. We also show that only certain specific linear combinations of the observables contribute to the TEC solutions. As a further improvement of the multifrequency GNSS-derived TEC solution, we propose and study the usage of an array of GNSS antennas. Analytical solutions, supported by numerical examples, of this array-based concept are presented, together with a discussion on its relevance for TEC determination.

The probe is constituted of a large inducer generating an uniformly oriented EC flow within the inspected material, and a sensing array probe featuring bobbin coils to sense the radial component of the magnetic field resulting from the eddy currents/defects interactions within {{the wall of the}} bore hole. The probe was designed with accurate defect characterization in view, i. e. to provide multi-frequency and high spatial resolution images with a reduced acquisition time, so as to enhance the informative content of the acquired eddy current data. An experimental set-up was build in order to validate the imaging performances of such a probe. A prototype featuring a large inducer and a single sensing coil which can be accurately positioned in the sensing area, has been developed in order to evaluate the sensing performances as well as to study the influence of the sensing array configuration on the imaging performances. The experimental results demonstrate a good sensing ability of the designed probe in the 10 - 800 kHz frequency range, with peak-signal-to-noise ratios higher than 36 dB at 10 kHz (and 62 dB at 800 kHz) for defects featuring dimensions as small as 0. 4 mm × 0. 2 mm × 0. 2 mm. Furthermore, a staggered row arrangement of the sensing array was proposed so as to significantly reduce the error due to the sampling step resulting from the pickup coils geometry (from 35 % to less than 9 % in the worst case).
