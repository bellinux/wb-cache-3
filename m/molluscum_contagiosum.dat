25|$|<b>Molluscum</b> <b>contagiosum</b> is {{extremely}} contagious. Transmission of the <b>molluscum</b> <b>contagiosum</b> virus can occur {{many different ways}} including direct skin contact (e.g., contact sports or sexual activity), contact with an infected surface (fomite), or autoinoculation (self-infection) by scratching or picking molluscum lesions and then touching {{other parts of the}} skin not previously affected by the virus. Children are particularly susceptible to autoinoculation and may have widespread clusters of lesions.|$|E
25|$|Histologically, <b>molluscum</b> <b>contagiosum</b> is {{characterized}} by molluscum bodies in the epidermis, above the stratum basale, which consist of large cells with abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm (accumulated virions) and a small peripheral nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Unlike herpesviruses, {{which can}} remain {{inactive}} {{in the body}} for months or years before reappearing, <b>molluscum</b> <b>contagiosum</b> does not remain in the body when the growths are gone from the skin and will not reappear on their own.|$|E
25|$|The appearance: e.g., purpuric (typical of {{vasculitis}} and meningococcal disease), {{fine and}} like sandpaper (typical of scarlet fever); circular lesions {{with a central}} depression are typical of <b>molluscum</b> <b>contagiosum</b> (and in the past, small pox); plaques with silver scales are typical of psoriasis.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 122million people {{globally}} {{were affected}} by <b>molluscum</b> <b>contagiosum</b> as of 2010 (1.8% of the population). It {{is more common in}} {{children between the ages of}} one and ten years old. The condition has become more common in the United States since 1966. MC is not a reason to keep a child out of school or daycare.|$|E
25|$|MC {{is caused}} by a {{poxvirus}} called the <b>molluscum</b> <b>contagiosum</b> virus (MCV). The virus is spread either by direct contact including sexual activity or via contaminated objects such as towels. The condition can also be spread to other areas of the body by the person themselves. Risk factors include a weak immune system, atopic dermatitis, and crowded living conditions. Following one infection, it is possible to get reinfected. Diagnosis is typically based on the appearance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Molluscum</b> <b>contagiosum</b> (MC), {{sometimes}} called water warts, is a viral {{infection of the}} skin that results in small, raised, pink lesions with a dimple in the center. They may occasionally be itchy or sore. They may occur singly or in groups. Any area of the skin may be affected, with abdomen, legs, arms, neck, genital area, and face being most common. Onset of the lesions is around 7 weeks after infection. It usually goes away within a year without scarring.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review of case reports and case series {{concluded that the}} limited available data suggest pulsed dye laser therapy is a safe and effective treatment for <b>molluscum</b> <b>contagiosum</b> and is generally well-tolerated by children. Side effects seen with pulsed dye laser therapy included mild temporary pain {{at the site of}} therapy, bruising (lasting up to 2–3 weeks), and temporary discoloration of the treated skin (as long as 1–6 months). No cases of permanent scarring have been reported. As of 2009, however, there is no evidence for genital lesions.|$|E

2500|$|Studies {{have found}} {{cantharidin}} {{to be an}} effective and safe treatment for removing <b>molluscum</b> <b>contagiosum.</b> [...] This medication is usually well-tolerated though mild side effects such as pain or blistering are common.|$|E
2500|$|Because <b>molluscum</b> <b>contagiosum</b> {{is usually}} {{self-limiting}} (resolving without treatment) and treatment options can cause discomfort to children, initial recommendations are often to simply {{wait for the}} lesions to resolve on their own. [...] Current treatment options are invasive, requiring tissue destruction and patient discomfort.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Molluscum</b> <b>contagiosum</b> lesions are flesh-colored, dome-shaped, and pearly in appearance. [...] They {{are often}} 1–5mm in diameter, with a dimpled center. Molluscum lesions are most {{commonly}} {{found on the}} face, arms, legs, torso, and armpits in children. Adults typically have molluscum lesions in the genital region and this {{is considered to be}} a sexually transmitted infection; because of this, if genital lesions are found on a child, sexual abuse should be suspected. [...] These lesions are generally not painful, but they may itch or become irritated. [...] Picking or scratching the bumps may lead to a spread of the viral infection responsible for <b>molluscum</b> <b>contagiosum,</b> an additional bacterial infection, and scarring. In about 10% of the cases, eczema develops around the lesions.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{cases of}} <b>molluscum</b> <b>contagiosum</b> will clear up {{naturally}} {{within two years}} (usually within nine months). [...] So long as the skin growths are present, {{there is a possibility}} of transmitting the infection to another person. [...] When the growths are gone, the possibility of spreading the infection is ended.|$|E
2500|$|Potential {{adverse effects}} of {{imiquimod}} use: [...] "Similar to the studies conducted in adults, the most frequently reported adverse reaction from 2 studies in children with <b>molluscum</b> <b>contagiosum</b> was application site reaction. Adverse events which occurred more frequently in Aldara-treated subjects compared with vehicle-treated subjects generally resembled those seen in studies in indications approved for adults and also included otitis media (5% Aldara vs. 3% vehicle) and conjunctivitis (3% Aldara vs. 2% vehicle). Erythema was the most frequently reported local skin reaction. Severe local skin reactions reported by Aldara-treated subjects in the pediatric studies included erythema (28%), edema (8%), scabbing/crusting (5%), flaking/scaling (5%), erosion (2%) and weeping/exudate (2%)." ...|$|E
2500|$|Imiquimod {{is a form}} of {{immunotherapy}} initially {{proposed as}} a treatment for molluscum based on promising results in small case series and clinical trials. However, two large randomized controlled trials, specifically requested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act both demonstrated that imiquimod cream applied three times per week was no more effective than placebo cream for treating molluscum after 18 weeks of treatment in a total of 702 children aged 2–12 years. In 2007, results from those trials—which remain unpublished—were incorporated into FDA-approved prescribing information for imiquimod, which states: [...] "Limitations of Use: Efficacy was not demonstrated for <b>molluscum</b> <b>contagiosum</b> in children aged 2–12." [...] In 2007, the FDA also updated imiquimod's label concerning safety issues raised in the two large trials and an FDA-requested pharmacokinetic study (the latter of which was published).
