5|$|The upshot is that {{scholars}} cannot assert with any confidence how much material Shakespeare took from the Ur-Hamlet (if it even existed), how <b>much</b> <b>from</b> Belleforest or Saxo, and how <b>much</b> <b>from</b> other contemporary sources (such as Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy). No clear evidence exists that Shakespeare made any direct references to Saxo's version. However, elements of Belleforest's version {{which are not}} in Saxo's story do appear in Shakespeare's play. Whether Shakespeare took these from Belleforest directly or through the Ur-Hamlet remains unclear.|$|E

5|$|A sequel, Fortune Winds: Ancient Trader, was {{developed}} by Swedish studio Legendo Entertainment and released in July 2012 for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. Fortune Winds includes improved AI, new player avatars and a save feature. GamesMaster was unimpressed with the sequel. The magazine awarded it 69 out of 100 and commented that it deviated too <b>much</b> <b>from</b> the original indie game.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{relatively}} intense language contact, Central Atlas Tamazight has a large stratum of Arabic loans. Many borrowed words in Berber also have native synonyms, e.g. /lbab/ or /tiflut/ 'door', the latter used more in rural areas. The contact was unequal, as Moroccan Arabic has not borrowed as <b>much</b> <b>from</b> Berber languages, though Berber has contributed to Moroccan and Algerian Arabics' very reduced vowel systems.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as {{archbishop}} there was a dispute with the monks of Christ Church Priory in Canterbury, who resented Baldwin's attempts to impose stricter control over them and disputed the legitimacy of Baldwin's election. For his part, Baldwin did not approve of the luxurious and pampered life the monks of Christ Church lived, and felt that they profited too <b>much</b> <b>from</b> the cult of Thomas Becket.|$|E

5|$|During the 18th century, the {{imperial}} library was constituted, but excluded virtually all Taoist books. By {{the beginning of}} the 20th century, Taoism had fallen <b>much</b> <b>from</b> favor (for example, only one complete copy of the Daozang still remained, at the White Cloud Monastery in Beijing).|$|E
5|$|Hollis is {{very much}} aware of Black's {{reputation}} and eager to prove her worth as an investigator. Intrigued by Frank's abilities as an investigator, she strives to learn as <b>much</b> <b>from</b> him as she can, while Frank also learns to recognize her strengths as an FBI agent. The respected, independent, ambitious young Bureau Agent formed a close relationship with Frank Black—and then turned her back on him to join the Millennium Group, which had agreed to cure her father of Alzheimer's.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{and other}} members of the genus Equus are adapted by {{evolutionary}} biology to eating small amounts of the same kind of food all day long. In the wild, horses ate prairie grasses in semi-arid regions and traveled significant distances each day in order to obtain adequate nutrition. Therefore, their digestive system was made to work best with a small but steady flow of food that does not change <b>much</b> <b>from</b> day to day.|$|E

5|$|In {{view of this}} interest, Darwin {{prepared}} a paper on Catasetum as an extract from his forthcoming book, which was read to the Linnean Society of London on 3 April 1862. Darwin solved the puzzle by showing that the three flowers were the male, female, and hermaphrodite forms of a single species, but as they differed so <b>much</b> <b>from</b> each other, they had been classified as different genera.|$|E

5|$|Oryzomys from Costa Rica have {{historically}} been referred to O.c.couesi, but Hanson and colleagues found that two specimens from Refugio Nacional de Vida Silvestre Mixto Maquenque, northeastern Costa Rica, differed as <b>much</b> <b>from</b> other O.couesi (11.93% Cytb sequence divergence) as O.couesi differed from the marsh rice rat (11.30%). They suggested that these animals represented a species distinct from O.couesi, but were unable to resolve the correct name for the species {{because they could not}} examine samples of dimidiatus or richmondi.|$|E

5|$|Among {{those with}} whom Vaughan Williams became {{friendly}} at Cambridge were the philosophers G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell, the historian G. M. Trevelyan and the musician Hugh Allen. He felt intellectually overshadowed by some of his companions, but he learned <b>much</b> <b>from</b> them and formed lifelong friendships with several. Among the women with whom he mixed socially at Cambridge was Adeline Fisher, the daughter of Herbert Fisher, {{an old friend of}} the Vaughan Williams family. She and Vaughan Williams grew close, and in June 1897, after he had left Cambridge, they became engaged to be married.|$|E
5|$|Another American {{tradition}} {{is that of}} an apolitical military, although this custom was of more recent origin, dating back only to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, but not so <b>much</b> <b>from</b> {{a lack of interest}} in politics as because frequently moving from state to state and living on Federal land effectively disenfranchised them under the laws of many states. Under General of the Army William T. Sherman, the Commanding General of the United States Army from 1869 to 1883, who hated politics, this custom of an apolitical military became firmly established.|$|E
5|$|Between 1905 and 1907, Taft came {{to terms}} with the {{likelihood}} he would be the next Republican nominee for president, though he did not plan to actively campaign for it. When Justice Henry B. Brown resigned in 1905, Taft would not accept the seat although Roosevelt offered it, a position Taft held to when another seat opened in 1906. Edith Roosevelt, the First Lady, disliked the growing closeness between the two men, feeling that they were too much alike and that the president did not gain <b>much</b> <b>from</b> the advice of someone who rarely contradicted him.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Magical Zoo's The Screamer was a bio-horror RPG {{released}} for the NEC PC-88 {{that was}} set in a post-apocalyptic research facility, while the gameplay featured shooter-based combat and permanent death. The {{latter half of the}} 1980s saw the release of several other horror-themed games, including Konami's Castlevania in 1986, and Sega's Kenseiden and Namco's Splatterhouse in 1988, though despite the macabre imagery of these games, their gameplay did not diverge <b>much</b> <b>from</b> other action games at the time. Splatterhouse in particular is notable for its large amount of bloodshed and terror, despite being an arcade beat 'em up with very little emphasis on survival.|$|E
5|$|Romney took a {{hands-on}} {{role in the}} Belmont Stake's matters, helping in domestic maintenance efforts, visiting the sick, and counseling burdened church members. A number of local church members later credited him with turning their lives around or helping them through difficult times. Others, rankled by his leadership style, desired a more consensus-based approach. Romney tried to balance the conservative directives from church leadership in Utah with the desire of some Massachusetts members {{to have a more}} flexible application of religious doctrine. He agreed with some requests from a liberal women's group that published Exponent II calling for changes in the way the church dealt with women, but he clashed with women whom he felt were departing too <b>much</b> <b>from</b> doctrine. In particular, he counseled women not to have abortions except in the rare cases allowed by LDS doctrine and encouraged unmarried women facing unplanned pregnancies to give up their babies for adoption. Romney later said that the years spent as an LDS minister gave him direct exposure to people struggling financially and empathy for those with family problems.|$|E
5|$|Sukumar Ray {{died when}} Satyajit was barely three, {{and the family}} survived on Suprabha Ray's meager income. Ray studied at Ballygunge Government High School, Calcutta, and {{completed}} his BA in economics at Presidency College, Calcutta then affiliated with the University of Calcutta, though his interest was always in fine arts. In 1940, his mother insisted that he study at the Visva-Bharati University at Santiniketan, founded by Rabindranath Tagore. Ray was reluctant due to his love of Calcutta, and the low opinion of the intellectual life at Santiniketan His mother's persuasion and his respect for Tagore finally convinced him to try. In Santiniketan, Ray came to appreciate Oriental art. He later admitted that he learned <b>much</b> <b>from</b> the famous painters Nandalal Bose and Benode Behari Mukherjee. Later he produced a documentary film, The Inner Eye, about Mukherjee. His visits to Ajanta, Ellora and Elephanta stimulated his admiration for Indian art.|$|E
