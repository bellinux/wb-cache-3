5000|$|The H-2 was {{comparison}} {{tested by}} Cycle magazine in 1973 against the Ducati 750, the Honda CB750, the Harley-Davidson Sportster 1000, the Kawasaki Z1, the Triumph Trident 750, and the Norton Commando 750. The competition consisted of acceleration, braking distance, and road race course lap-times. Each test was run several times including 10 attempts at a fastest road course time. The H2 was the fastest accelerating <b>machine,</b> <b>posting</b> the fastest 1/4 mile {{run on a}} drag strip. Experts were surprised at the other results. Despite an uncomfortable feel and slight front wheel hop under hard braking and not giving the sensation of stopping particularly fast it had the shortest stopping distance and highest braking G load of all the bikes. On the road course, despite what had been heard and written about its ill handling, frame flexing and the supposed tendency to speed wobble exiting high speed turns, it was tied for the fastest lap time with the Kawasaki Z-1 to the tenth of a second. Overall the Kawasaki H-2 750 had the lowest ET, second-highest quarter-mile speed, the fastest lap time, the strongest braking force, the highest torque and horsepower readings on the dynamometer, the highest power-to-weight ratio, the lowest price and scored by points for performance {{was by far the}} least expensive per unit displacement ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractEquality sets of finite sets of homomorphisms are {{studied as}} part of formal {{language}} theory. Some particular equality sets, called Mergek(k-COPY), are investigated. These languages are combinatorially difficult, and are full semiAFL generators of the recursively enumerable sets, and are semiAFL generators of the class MULTI-RESET, provided k ⩾ 3. To accomplish this characterization, equality sets are related to multihead and multitape <b>Post</b> <b>machines</b> operating in real time. A <b>Post</b> <b>machine</b> has a one-way input tape and Post tapes as storage tapes, which in the multihead version are scanned {{from left to right}} by a write head and several read heads. By simulating <b>Post</b> <b>machines</b> by multiple reset machines, and vice versa, several new characterisations of the class MULTI-RESET are obtained, and it is shown that for multihead and multitape <b>Post</b> <b>machines</b> linear time is no more powerful than real time, and two Post tapes or, alternatively, three heads on one Post tape are as powerful as any finite number of heads or tapes. Finally, some complexity bounds for equality sets and <b>Post</b> <b>machines</b> are discussed...|$|R

On {{the opening day of}} the battle, 15 September 1916, his unit was tasked with {{capturing}} a series of German held trenches from their position south-east of High Wood. While the first trench was captured with ease with the assistance of effective artillery support, his company came under heavy flanking machine gun fire while advancing to the next trench line, which inflicted heavy casualties amongst the company. Brown, together with another soldier, Corporal J. Rodgers, attacked one <b>machine</b> gun <b>post,</b> killing the crew and capturing the gun. This allowed the remaining soldiers to regroup and prepare for an attack on the next trench, but during a covering artillery barrage they once again came under fire from a <b>machine</b> gun <b>post.</b> Brown was amongst those who attacked this second <b>machine</b> gun <b>post,</b> swiftly dealing with the threat.|$|R
