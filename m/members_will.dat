5|$|The game lets players {{control the}} mute {{criminal}} Claude. During the story, Claude meets various new characters from gangs. As players completes missions for different gangs, fellow gang <b>members</b> <b>will</b> often defend players, while rival gang <b>members</b> <b>will</b> recognise players and subsequently shoot on sight. While free roaming the game world, players may {{engage in activities}} such as a vigilante minigame, a fire fighting activity, and a taxi cab service. Completion of these activities grants players with context-specific rewards; for example, completing the vigilante mission allows players to bribe police after committing a crime.|$|E

5|$|During the story, Tommy meets {{characters}} from various gangs. As the player completes missions for different gangs, fellow gang <b>members</b> <b>will</b> often defend the player, while rival gang <b>members</b> <b>will</b> recognise the player and subsequently shoot on sight. While free roaming the game world, the player may {{engage in activities}} such as a vigilante minigame, a fire fighting activity, and a taxi cab service. Completion of these activities grants the player with context-specific rewards. As Tommy builds his criminal empire, the player may purchase a number of properties distributed across the city, some of which act as additional hideouts where weapons can be collected and vehicles can be stored. There are also a variety of businesses which can be purchased, including a film studio, a taxi company, and several entertainment clubs. Each commercial property {{has a number of}} missions attached to it, such as eliminating competition or stealing equipment; once all missions are complete, the property begins to generate an ongoing income available for the player.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} in the mission, a new {{temporary}} squad member, Liara T'Soni, with a different set of powers joins the squad, and the player must choose who of the previous two <b>members</b> <b>will</b> remain {{for the rest of the}} mission. The relationship between Shepard and Liara can vary depending on whether they were romantically involved in the original Mass Effect. The mission includes two bosses and a chase scene in which the player must control a high-speed vehicle through the skies of a city. The player may also find numerous in-game upgrades that enhance aspects of the game's weapons and armor.|$|E
5|$|On 5 July 2015, the {{citizens}} of Greece voted decisively (a 61% to 39% decision with 62.5% voter turnout) to reject a referendum {{that would have given}} Greece more bailout help from other EU members in return for increased austerity measures. As a result of this vote, Greece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis stepped down on 6 July. Negotiations between Greece and other Eurozone <b>members</b> <b>will</b> continue in the following days to procure funds from the European Central Bank in order to prevent an economic collapse in the country.|$|E

One team <b>member</b> <b>will</b> have to pick an ostrich, and complete a 40-metre race course while keeping balanced to receive their next clue. If the team were unable to complete the course within four attempts, they will had to wait 15 minutes outside the area before they were given their next clue.|$|R
50|$|At the Dalat Palace Golf Club, {{one team}} <b>member</b> <b>will</b> {{have to ride}} in the Zorb, while the other <b>member</b> <b>will</b> have to push the ball and hit the {{obstacles}} correctly. Teams will have to repeat four times in ten minutes, while alternating team members in between. If teams were unable to complete, they will incur a 10-minute penalty. Once all the six obstacles are cleared, they receive the next clue.|$|R
5|$|As {{shown in}} the table, {{the total number of}} {{possible}} combinations to have an equal (conserved) number of A and B alleles is six, and its probability is 6/16. The total number of possible alternative combinations is ten, and the probability of unequal number of A and B alleles is 10/16. Thus, although the original colony began with an equal number of A and B alleles, chances are that the number of alleles in the remaining population of four <b>members</b> <b>will</b> not be equal. In the latter case, genetic drift has occurred because the population's allele frequencies have changed due to random sampling. In this example the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as population bottleneck.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the large}} number of factions created for the game, {{developers}} reintroduced the reputation system that was first used in Fallout 2 and had been absent in Fallout 3. Much like Karma, a player's standing with a faction can change depending on how they interact with them and what decisions they make. If, for example, players help a faction, their reputation with them improves in all locations controlled by that faction; opting to kill their <b>members</b> <b>will</b> cause a loss of reputation. The type of reputation the player has with each faction affects how non-player characters (NPCs) behave towards them; a good reputation might make completing some quests easier, provide discounts with the faction's vendors, and cause faction members to offer gifts; a bad reputation may lead to the faction refusing to help the player or attacking them on sight, or sending thugs after the player.|$|E
5|$|Inside the apartment, Mulder's {{search for}} clues is {{interrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} The Smoking Man, who tells Mulder that he has been betrayed by Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens), who is actually his son. The Smoking Man tells Mulder that, many years ago, the Syndicate agreed by majority vote, against Bill Mulder's objections, to align with the alien colonists to be spared during colonization. The Syndicate was forced to give up family members to the colonists as collateral so that an alien fetus could be given to the Syndicate {{in order for them to}} gain access to alien DNA. Since Bill Mulder was slow to agree, Samantha Mulder was not taken until after the others. Using the fetus, the Syndicate worked on creating alien-human hybrids who could survive colonization. The Smoking Man tells Mulder that colonization will begin once Cassandra is handed over and that Mulder will be able to see his sister again, providing him with an address to the hangar where the Syndicate <b>members</b> <b>will</b> be meeting the colonists.|$|E

The second team member place {{the tip of a}} pointed shovel with sand into the opened sandbag. A square shovel is not recommended as the blade of the shovel will not fit into the sandbag when filling. The third team <b>member</b> <b>will</b> transport and stockpile the filled sandbags.|$|R

5|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{cooperative}} breeders, {{with parental}} care being {{shared by all}} community members. For example, mothers will stash their offspring with other mothers or leave them to be guarded by other community members, including non-breeding individuals of both genders. While the mother is away, community <b>members</b> <b>will</b> not only care for and guard them, but also sound alarm calls if danger is detected or if leaving the infant alone. They will also respond to alarm calls by others. These coordinated vigilance displays further involve communal transmission of the alarm call, with nearby community members repeating the alarm call, potentially summoning the mother back to her offspring. Infant transport by {{other members of the}} community has also been recorded. Females have been observed nursing infants of their close relatives, while close kin have adopted rejected infants, acting as foster parents.|$|E
5|$|Some Denver streets have bicycle lanes, {{leaving a}} {{patchwork}} of disjointed routes throughout the city. There are over 850 miles of paved, off-road, bike paths in Denver parks and along bodies of water, like Cherry Creek and the South Platte. This allows for {{a significant portion of}} Denver's population to be bicycle commuters and has led to Denver being known as a bicycle-friendly city. Some local residents are very opposed to bike lanes, which have caused some plans to be watered down or nixed. The review process for one bike line on Broadway will last over a year before city council <b>members</b> <b>will</b> make a decision. In addition to the many bike paths, Denver launched B-Cycle– a citywide bicycle sharing program– in late April 2010. The B-Cycle network was the largest in the United States {{at the time of its}} launch, boasting 400 bicycles.|$|E

Only Joker avoids capture and, with EDI's help, {{is able to}} extract the Normandy to safety. After Shepard's squad returns, the team uses the Omega-4 Relay to reach the Collector base, located in the Galactic Center. The team rescues any surviving Normandy crew members and fights {{their way to the}} central chamber. Squad <b>members</b> <b>will</b> either survive or perish depending on their loyalty to Shepard, the upgrades made to the Normandy, and the tasks they are assigned in battle. In the central chamber, Shepard discovers that the Collectors have been constructing a new Human-Reaper made from the genetic material of the abducted colonists.|$|E

5|$|The station can be {{seen from}} the Earth with the naked eye and, as of , is the largest {{artificial}} satellite in Earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station. The Soyuz spacecraft delivers crew members, stays docked for their half-year-long missions and then returns them home. Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft service the ISS, they are the Russian Progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000, the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) since 2008, the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) since 2009, the American Dragon spacecraft since 2012, and the American Cygnus spacecraft since 2013. The Space Shuttle, before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members, although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay. Until another US manned spacecraft is ready, crew <b>members</b> <b>will</b> travel to and from the International Space Station exclusively aboard the Soyuz. The highest number of people occupying the ISS has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the late Shuttle ISS assembly missions.|$|E
5|$|The Mysterium Tech (or MysTech) {{system allows}} players to use in-game objects collectively known as MysTech, {{and create new}} MysTech by using a {{configuration}} screen accessed through Elementor Host items. MysTech cannot be used until they are awakened after a certain story event. Eight basic colors of MysTech exist, representing different elements; for example, green represents poison. Players can use MysTech to inflict damage upon enemies, plague them with certain status effects (such as freezing them in place), or heal party members. Casting status effect-MysTech on party <b>members</b> <b>will</b> cure them if afflicted by enemy status spells. MysTech slabs and Elementor Hosts can be found as treasure in the game world or bought from shops. To create MysTech, players place colored bugs (found on small hills in several game locations) in empty slots on an Elementor Host. The color of bugs placed in the function slot determines the color of MysTech, while other slots modify the power and/or range of the spell. Players can add special bugs known as Cobalt Crawlers to make a spell target all enemies instead of one; a Host filled with eight Crawlers unlocks a secret spell. The effect of bugs can be amplified by feeding them petals from Lifeflowers, {{which can be found}} scattered throughout the world of Anachronox. Special types of Hosts with two or three different functions allow players to pick which MysTech function to use in battle.|$|E

The first <b>member</b> <b>will</b> then solve a Tangram puzzle {{presented}} at the station. After completing the puzzle, he/she will raise a flag signaling completion, if successful, the first <b>member</b> <b>will</b> pass the cap to the second member and the team will run down the 10 m path back to reach the second station. The second <b>member</b> <b>will</b> then engage in a ring toss. After one successful toss, the cap will be passed to the third <b>member</b> and they <b>will</b> run back to the first station to complete a second Tangram puzzle. After completion, the cap will be passed to the fourth and final member, in which they will run back to the second station. After the final member makes a successful throw, the team completes the relay. The fastest team to successfully complete the relay will win the round.|$|R
