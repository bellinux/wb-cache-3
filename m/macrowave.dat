40|$|Strong lensing has {{developed}} into an important astrophysical tool for probing both cosmology and galaxies (their structures, formations, and evolutions). Now several hundreds of strong lens systems produced by massive galaxies have been discovered, which may form well-defined samples useful for statistical analyses. To collect a relatively complete lens redshift data from various large systematic surveys of gravitationally lensed quasars {{and check the}} possibility {{to use it as}} a future complementarity to other cosmological probes. We use the distribution of gravitationally-lensed image separations observed in the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS), the PMN-NVSS Extragalactic Lens Survey (PANELS), the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and other surveys, considering a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model for galactic potentials as well as improved new measurements of the velocity dispersion function of galaxies based on the SDSS DR 5 data and recent semi-analytical modeling of galaxy formation, to constrain two dark energy models (ΛCDM and constant w) under a flat universe assumption. We find that the current lens redshift data give a relatively weak constraint on the model parameters. However, by combing the redshift data with the baryonic acoustic oscillation peak and the comic <b>macrowave</b> background data, we obtain more stringent results, which show that the flat Λ CDM model is still included at 1 σ.

40|$|Intelligent finance {{represents}} {{a new direction}} recently emerging from the confluence of several distinct disciplines in financial market analysis, investing and trading, removing any historical or artificial barrier between them. It is conceived as the science, technology and art of the comprehensive, predictive, dynamic and strategic analysis of global financial markets, towards a unification and integration of academic finance and professional finance. As a comprehensive approach, it is a quest for absolute positive and non-trivial returns in investing and trading by exploiting complete information about financial markets from all general perspectives, drawing ideas, theories, models and techniques from many related academic disciplines, such as macroeconomics, microeconomics, academic finance, financial mathematics, econophysics, behavioural finance and computational finance, and from professional schools of thought, such as <b>macrowave</b> investing, trend following, fundamental analysis, technical analysis, mind analysis, active speculation, etc. In terms of risk management, intelligent finance is expected to minimize the very last risk—the incompleteness of an investing or trading method or system. The theoretical framework of intelligent finance consists of four major components: financial information fusion, multilevel stochastic dynamic process models, active portfolio and total risk management, and financial strategic analysis. We first provide the background from which intelligent finance has recently emerged as a new direction in finance research and industry, and then provide a brief theoretical review of the predictability of financial markets since Bachelier. After these background discussions, we clarify the major research directions of intelligent finance.

40|$|Objective: To {{discover}} {{whether the}} human stomach contracts every 20 seconds or not. Design: Manometric study. Setting: Teaching hospital, Belgium. Subjects: 10 healthy volunteers, and 31 {{patients who had}} had the whole stomach denervated and {{pulled up to the}} neck for oesophageal replacement. Interrelations: Analysis of selected strips of manometric tracings obtained with intraluminal perfused catheters. 13 patients were given erythromycin (Ig/day) by mouth. Main outcome measures: Estimation of the rate and frequency distribution according to amplitude of intraluminal pressure waves with the vertical axis of the tracings scaled up to reflect contractions within the gastric wall. Results: Microwaves (> 9 mmHg) that came in between conventional <b>macrowaves</b> ( 0. 0001). Microwaves in strips in which they were the most prominent were of higher amplitude in patients than in healthy volunteers (median: 3. 5 compared with 2. 5 mmHg; p < 0. 0001). Conclusions: The human stomach has mechanical activity at {{the rate at which the}} pacemaker generates electrical slow waves. The classic phases of the gastric motor activity seem to differ from each other by the frequency distribution of pressure waves according to amplitude rather than by the contraction rate. Weak mechanical activity is much more readily detectable after the stomach has been denervated and tailored for oesophageal substitution...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} is content study about propagation {{of the light}} on <b>macrowaves</b> trapeziform. This research divided become two phases. The first phase is study about propagation of the light on mathematics. This phase aim to get relations between collector lenght, collector skewness, collector wide, and refraction index collector on numerical aperture (NA). The result of this research show that the general formula of reflection for-i on solar collector organized as trapeziform is is top angle collector, and is angle formed by collector side to perpendicular line of collector axis. In the other side, general formula for calculating minimum collector length in order to the light come with certain incidence angle creeping on collector without across critis angle i) for even n (n= 2, 4, 6, [...] .), and for odd m (m= 3, 5, 7, [...] .). By using formula dan X can be got mathematical NA. After this research had done on mathematics, the next phase examined the result in a experiment. The sample for this experiment is made of PMMA. The phase this experiment divided become five phases. There are measuring PMMA absorbance, measuring PMMA reflectance, measuring PMMA refraction index, ce until ent can be got PMMA reflectance curve for wave mode TE and TM. Where as for the third experiment can be got PMMA refraction index, and for the fourth experiment can be got collector NA for every collector length variation with collector skewness angle variation 83 °, 85 ° and 87 °. Length variation that used is 5, 25 cm, 6 cm, 6, 5 cm and 7 cm. The result of this {{research is}} obtained result NA which much the same to with result of mathematical calculation.
