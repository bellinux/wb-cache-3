5000|$|For a {{star with}} a mass above about 0.25 solar masses (...) , once the core is {{depleted}} of hydrogen it contracts and heats up so that hydrogen starts to fuse in a shell around the core. The portion of the star outside the shell expands and cools, but with only a small increase in luminosity, and the star becomes a subgiant. The inert helium core continues to grow and increase temperature as it accretes helium from the shell, but in stars up to about [...] it does not become hot enough to start helium burning (higher-mass stars are supergiants and evolve differently). Instead, {{after just a few}} million years the core reaches the Schönberg-Chandrasekhar limit, rapidly collapses, and may become degenerate. This causes the outer layers to expand even further and generates a strong convective zone that brings heavy elements to the surface in a process called the first dredge-up. This strong convection also increases the transport of energy to the surface, the luminosity increases dramatically, and the star moves onto the red-giant branch where it will stably burn hydrogen in a shell for a substantial fraction of its entire life (roughly 10% for a Sun-like star). The core continues to gain <b>mass,</b> <b>contract,</b> and increase in temperature, whereas there is some mass loss in the outer layers., § 5.9.|$|E

The ba is of her presentation are the legal systems of the USA, Great Britain and the Federal Republic of Germany. In the first part of her article, the author presents the object and types of contracts (custom software contracts, package software <b>contracts,</b> <b>mass</b> marketed software <b>contracts,</b> especially shrink-wrap agreements). A basic contractual form of offering software is licence agreement. The author pays special attention to form contracts developed by the As ociation of Data Processing Service Organization. In the second part of her article the author discursses the legal status of computer programmes. In recent years, a prevailing form of legal protection is copyright law, accompanied by patent law and know-how protection within the trade secret law. The author also pre ents the position of Polish legal doctrine on the protection of computer programmes and analyses the premises of the draft of the Poli h copyright law, which is to include computer programmes under its protection. The third part of the article contains the analysis of typical elements of the contracts {{for the use of}} computer programmes (the scope of the licence, the character of the licence, intellectual property rights, licencee's rights to copying, alterations, the access to source code, the use of improved programmes, protection of secrecy, licence fees, legal and technical guarantees for the licensor, liability and the causes and consequences of expiration of a contract). Special attention is paid to the stipulations which may be of restrictive character for the buyer, limiting his or her rights to use the programme (e. g. no access to source code, the interdiction to make copies, especially back-up copies, the interdiction to do reverse engineering, etc.). Next, the author analyses a special form of distribution of mass marketed software (shrink-wrap licence). The admissibility of such contracts has recently been questioned, for they limit excessively the rights of the buyer protected by copyright law and they are an example of an abuse of economic power by the seller. The last part of the article contains the remarks on the possibilities of applying foreign solutions in Polish software trade (domestic and international). In this context the author points to the need of seeking the solutions which could best protect the interests of Polish software importers.

40|$|Contract law and {{the formal}} models of {{contract}} economics assume that agreements are fully customized. On the other hand, recent legal research highlights the role standardized terms play in contract design. Those lines of research overlook an important class of contracts between those extremes. Many contracts, such as the merger agreements studied here, are complex combinations of customized and standardized terms, and thereby achieve economies of both scale and scope. Such contracts are “mass customized,” to borrow a term from engineering research. This Article introduces a theoretical framework for understanding how mass customization of such complex agreements is achieved. It adds to recent scholarship that applies modularity theory {{to the design of}} complex agreements by introducing an alternative approach—flexible specialization. It then introduces empirical methods for studying the structure of complex agreements. Using hand-collected data from samples of public company merger agreements and of the teams of deal lawyers that designed them, this Article presents the results of a preliminary empirical study that finds that the architecture of <b>mass</b> customized <b>contracts</b> reflects the logic of flexible specialization rather than modular design. The picture of contract design that emerges is of agreements built upon a flexible architecture provided by a dynamic cluster of experts, more similar to the industrial districts of Emilia-Romagna in Italy than Ford Motor Company’s fabled Highland Park assembly line. Those preliminary results suggest important implications for doctrine, policy, and research. In regard to doctrine, this Article adds a missing dimension to recent attempts to articulate a non-unitary theory of U. S. contract law. With respect to policy, evidence that flexible specialization underpins the infrastructure of the mergers and acquisitions (M 2 ̆ 6 A) market challenges deterministic accounts of the legal industry’s transformation, and illuminates the overlooked trade-offs presented by recent arguments to further standardize complex contracting.
