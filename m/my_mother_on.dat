I {{had gone to the}} reformatory from the prison. I was put in the prison, because I was a thief. I was a thief, because <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> went <b>on</b> the streets when I was quite a little girl. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> went <b>on</b> the streets, because the gentleman who was my father deserted her.

60|$|My {{father was}} a doctor, having an {{excellent}} practice in a large country town. I have heard that he married against the wishes of his family. They could not object to <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>on</b> the score of birth, breeding, or character--they only disliked her heartily.

60|$|My {{father was}} a retired lawyer, who, being in ill health, went with <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>on</b> a two years' trip to Europe.

The death of both my parents at once was a fearful blow to me, and for a long while I could not think, and was utterly unable to judge what was taking place around me. At the end of three months I was informed that Mr. Stillwell had been appointed my guardian, and then I was taken from school and placed in his office in New York City.|$|E

I was very much flattered by Prince Frederick's attentions, and quite ready to respond to them. My own family was noble, and the match was not {{considered}} a particularly unequal one, for though Frederick was of the Royal House, he {{was a long way}} from the succession. Still, there was a good deal of trouble when a messenger from Frederick went to my father. He declared that I was altogether too young; <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>on</b> the other hand, was just as anxious to conclude the match. Eventually it was arranged that the betrothal should take place in six months--and Frederick went back to Mexonia." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{the first}} place, I {{had so much}} {{confidence}} in myself, that I was quite convinced that I could escape. In the second, my family, though of good repute, has never been wealthy, and I could not bring myself to take anything from the small income of <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, it would never do for a man like me to be outshone by the bourgeois society of an English country town, or to be without the means of showing courtesies and attentions to those ladies whom I should attract. It was for these reasons that I preferred {{to be buried in}} the dreadful prison of Dartmoor. I wish now to tell you of my adventures in England, and how far Milor Wellington's words were true when he said that his King would hold me.|$|E

Imagine our alarm {{in the morning when}} we found that Ennia was missing from the house, and our terrible grief when, an hour later, a messenger came from the governor of the prison to say that Ennia was in his charge. My father is quite broken down by the blow. He does not seem to care about Ennia having joined the new sect--you know it is his opinion that everyone should choose their own religion--but he is chiefly grieved at the thought that she should have gone out at night attended only by her nurse, and that she should have done this secretly and without his knowledge. <b>My</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>on</b> the other hand, is most of all shocked that Ennia should have given up the gods of Rome for a religion of slaves, and that, being the daughter of a noble house, she should have consorted with people beneath her.|$|E

What I wished to say was that Mr. Woodley was perfectly odious, but that Mr. Carruthers, who was a much older man, was more agreeable. He was a dark, sallow, clean-shaven, silent person, but he had polite manners and a pleasant smile. He inquired how we were left, and on finding that we were very poor, he suggested that I should come and teach music to his only daughter, aged ten. I said that I did not like to leave <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>on</b> which he suggested that I should go home to her every week-end, and he offered me a hundred a year, which was certainly splendid pay. So it ended by my accepting, and I went down to Chiltern Grange, about six miles from Farnham. Mr. Carruthers was a widower, but he had engaged a lady housekeeper, a very respectable, elderly person, called Mrs. Dixon, to look after his establishment. The child was a dear, and everything promised well. Mr. Carruthers was very kind and very musical, and we had most pleasant evenings together. Every week-end I went home to my mother in town.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} accompanying <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>on</b> a {{visit to}} the old house we have just left, in the summer, when I was at home for the holidays. It was a lovely, sunshiny morning. There was nobody indoors, and we walked out into the garden. As we approached that lawn yonder, {{on the other side of}} the shrubbery, I saw, first, a young woman in mourning (apparently a servant) sitting reading; then a little girl, dressed all in black, moving toward us slowly over the bright turf, and holding up before her a baby, whom she was trying to teach to walk. She looked, to my ideas, so very young to be engaged in such an occupation as this, and her gloomy black frock appeared to be such an unnaturally grave garment for a mere child of her age, and looked so doubly dismal by contrast with the brilliant sunny lawn on which she stood, that I quite started when I first saw her, and eagerly asked my mother who she was. The answer informed me of the sad family story, which I have been just relating to you. Mrs. Welwyn had then been buried about three months; and Ida, in her childish way, was trying, as she had promised, to supply her mother's place to her infant sister Rosamond.|$|E

60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>on</b> {{the other}} hand, {{held that the}} very essence of a church was that it should have a {{hierarchy}} and a graduated government within itself, with the king at the apex, the archbishops beneath him, the bishops under their control, and so down through the ministry to the common folk. Such was, in her opinion, the Church as established in the beginning, and no religion without these characteristics could lay any claim to being the true one. Ritual was to her of as great importance as morality, and if every tradesman and farmer were allowed to invent prayers, and change the service as the fancy seized him, {{it would be impossible to}} preserve the purity of the Christian creed. She agreed that religion was based upon the Bible, but the Bible was a book which contained much that was obscure, and unless that obscurity were cleared away by a duly elected and consecrated servant of God, a lineal descendant of the Disciples, all human wisdom might not serve to interpret it aright. That was my mother's position, and neither argument nor entreaty could move her from it. The only question of belief on which my two parents were equally ardent was their mutual dislike and distrust of the Roman Catholic forms of worship, and in this the Churchwoman was every whit as decided as the fanatical Independent.|$|E

60|$|His lordship's ill opinion {{having been}} removed by a better {{knowledge}} of me, our acquaintance daily grew more intimate; and, especially between {{the ladies of}} his family and my own, a close friendship arose--between them and my wife at least. Hal's wife, received kindly at the little provincial court, as all ladies were, made herself by no means popular there by the hot and eager political tone which she adopted. She assailed all the Government measures with indiscriminating acrimony. Were they lenient? She said the perfidious British Government was only preparing a snare, and biding its time until it could forge heavier chains for unhappy America. Were they angry? Why did not every American citizen rise, assert his rights as a freeman, and serve every British governor, officer, soldier, as they had treated the East India Company's tea? <b>My</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>on</b> the other hand, was pleased to express her opinions with equal frankness, and, indeed, to press her advice upon his Excellency with a volubility which may have fatigued that representative of the Sovereign. Call out the militia; send for fresh troops from New York, from home, from anywhere; lock up the Capitol! (this advice was followed, it must be owned) and send every one of the ringleaders amongst those wicked burgesses to prison! was Madam Esmond's daily counsel to the Governor by word and letter. And if not only the burgesses, but the burgesses' wives could have been led off to punishment and captivity, I think this Brutus of a woman would scarce have appealed against the sentence.|$|E

60|$|It was <b>my</b> <b>mother's.</b> A pencil-writing, <b>on</b> a {{crushed and}} torn piece of paper, blotted with wet. Folded roughly like a letter, and {{directed}} {{to me at}} my guardian's.|$|R
