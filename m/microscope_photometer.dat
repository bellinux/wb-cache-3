After a short representation of the physical basis of this procedure the new <b>microscope</b> <b>photometer</b> is introduced. First measurements for the adaptation of the new instrument of the so far used <b>microscope</b> <b>photometer</b> are discussed.

A theoretical relation has been found between the optical anisotropy factor, the orientation parameter of BOKROS and the BACON anisotropy factor, which fits the experimental values...|$|E
30|$|Because of {{different}} depositional and tectonic environments, coal usually contains different maceral compositions and {{various kinds of}} mineral components, which greatly affect the results of coal structural testing. Therefore, coal samples must be pretreated to extract vitrinite components and remove inorganic (mineral) components before testing and analysis. Based on in situ (the coal sample was basically intact) investigation, detailed micro-structural observations of these samples, using optical microscopy and SEM, vitrinite reflectance analysis, were carried out on polished sections under halogen lamp and oil immersion conditions using a Leitz Orthoplan/MPV-SP <b>microscope</b> <b>photometer.</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective: A new {{therapeutic}} {{approach in}} eosin-ophilic fungal rhinosinusitis is topical application of antifungals such as amphotericin B. The tolerability of a recently applied concentration of this drug by human nasal mucosa was tested in vitro. Methods: Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) {{was measured by}} a pho-tometric technique, combining a light <b>microscope,</b> a <b>photometer,</b> a photograph-multiplier, and a com-puted analyzing unit. Results: Treatment for 20 minutes with amphotericin B finally diluted in saline to 0. 1 mg/mL caused no decrease in CBF. By contrast, both amphotericin B diluted in distilled water and distilled water without additives lowered CBFabout 50 %. This decreasewas not reversible after reincubation for 20 minute in saline. Conclusions:The results confirm the good tolerability of topical am-photericin B in the nasal and paranasal cavity. Be-cause of the negative effect of distilled water, final dilution in physiologic solvents should be considered...|$|R
40|$|Electrochromic (EC) {{materials}} such as poly (dimethyl 3, 4 - propylenedioxythiophene) show great potential for numerous future applications due to their high change in absorption when their level of doping is varied and fast switching times (on the order of seconds). We have constructed EC devices based on this polymer and conducted spectroscopic measurements in the ultraviolet through far infrared range using both a Fourier Transform Infrared interferometer and a <b>microscope</b> grating <b>photometer.</b> These data are {{used to determine the}} contrast between doped and neutral states, the time required for the material to fully oxidize and neutralize, and the lifetime of the device. Our results indicate a maximum change in reflectance between doped and neutral states (D %Rmax) of 93 % at a wavelength of 1420 nm between doped and neutral states, as well as rapid switching times, but suggest more research is necessary to increase the lifetime to a length appropriate for further use...|$|R

With a special software program cross sections of dyed human hair {{can be analyzed}} automatically with respect o dye distribution from the outside {{to the inside of}} the hair shaft. Very important for such a measurement is the production of microtome cross ections of defined thickness in a reproducible manner. With some direct dyestuffs the influence of dyeing time on the dye-distribution profile across the hair section is demonstrated. The advantage of carrying out these measurements at a specific wavelength at which the dyestuff has its maximum absorption is shown...|$|R
40|$|A method {{which was}} {{designed}} for microphotometric measurements of banded human chromosomes using a computer-controlled Zeiss scanning <b>microscope</b> <b>photometer</b> (SMP) is described. Modification of the Apamos 2 program (H. G. Zimmer, Zeiss, Oberkochen) enabled the scanning stage on the SMP to move the slides continuously thus obtaining high resolution of measurements. Results of scanning directly on the slides when compared with scanning on microphotographs revealed no significant differences; the banding patterns of the chromosomes were reproduced {{with a high degree}} of accuracy by both methods. Chromosomes No. 2, 10, 16, and 20 are described in detail...|$|E
40|$|An {{epifluorescence}} <b>microscope</b> <b>photometer</b> {{was used}} to develop a new, in vivo fluorimetric method for analyzing fluorescence intensities of epilithic microalgae grown on clay tiles in the field. This enabled a nondestructive, direct quantification of algal biomass on the substratum surface. Measurements of a chlorophyll a standard in ethanol (90 %) with our fluorimetric method (exitation at 546 nm; emission, > 590 nm) correlated well with those from conventional spectrofluorimetric and spectrophotometric methods. Biofilms were analyzed with the <b>microscope</b> <b>photometer</b> by measuring the in vivo fluorescence intensity of 70 spots distributed randomly over the tile surface. They were then analyzed by the two in vitro methods after photopigment extraction. Chlorophyll a content and in vivo fluorescence intensity correlated well. The regression curves were linear up to 6 (mu) g cm(sup- 2) but were quadratic or hyperbolic at higher concentrations of up to 28 (mu) g cm(sup- 2). The degree of scatter among individual measurements was higher in biofilms than chlorophyll a standards. This in vivo analysis is well suited to ecological experiments and {{has the advantage of}} measuring on an extremely small scale, which enables direct analysis of the microdistribution of epilithic microalgae in live biofilms. We demonstrated this by comparing fluorescence intensities of the grazing tracks of the snail Ancylus fluviatilis with those of ungrazed areas. Our in vivo analysis is also unique in enabling biofilms on artificial substrata to be removed, analyzed, and then returned intact in field or laboratory experiments...|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of alpha-emitting bone-seeking radionuclides {{and the relationship}} between bone tumor incidence and the local dosimetry of radionuclides in bone are investigated. The microdistributions of alpha-emitting radionuclides in the trabecular bone from the proximal humerus, distal humerus, proximal ulna, proximal femur, and distal femur of six young adult beagles injected with Am- 241 (three with 2. 8 micro-Ci/kg and three with 0. 9 micro-Ci/kg) are estimated using a computer-controlled <b>microscope</b> <b>photometer</b> system; the components of the University of Utah Optical Track Scanner are described. The morphometric parameters for the beagles are calculated and analyzed. It is observed that the beagles injected with 0. 9 micro-Ci of Am- 241 /kg showed an increase in the percentage of bone and trabecular bone thickness, and a reduction in the width of the bone marrow space and surface/volume ratio. The data reveal that radiation damage causes abnormal bone structure...|$|E
30|$|Vitrinite {{reflectance}} (VR) {{measurements for}} {{the samples were}} carried out following the procedures of Taylor et al. (1998), using a Leitz <b>microscope</b> with a <b>photometer.</b> An interference filter with a pass band peak of 546  nm and a 50 × oil immersion objective were used. Vitrinite grains 50 in number were measured using plane polarized light, the maximum reflectances of each sample and the averages of these are reported as the mean maximum VR values. Vitrinite reflectance {{is used as a}} tool for the determination of rank and maturation of the coals, the reflectance measurement was carried out on vitrinite (especially collotelinite) grains which were free of any weathering features and contamination (Figs.  3 – 5). The vitrinite reflectance of the coals of Mand-Raigarh coals shows R o min ranging from 0.38  % to 0.49  %, R o max from 0.49  % to 0.67  % and R o mean from 0.44  % to 0.56  % and standard deviation from 0.02 to 0.07.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1856 and 1872, Browning {{acquired}} provisional patents for {{designs of}} numerous scientific instruments. He {{was also the}} recipient of an award at the 1862 International Exhibition held in London. He was recognised for his temperature-compensated aneroid barometer. Browning's scientific instruments were used in physics, chemistry, and biology. The products he designed and manufactured included spectroscopes, telescopes, <b>microscopes,</b> barometers, <b>photometers,</b> cameras, ophthalmoscopes, and electrical equipment such as electric lamps. [...] John Browning installed the first electric light in London, the occasion being a banquet to honour the Shah of Persia {{during his visit to}} Queen Victoria. The location was the Guildhall, which {{has been used as a}} town hall in the City of London for hundreds of years and continues to be the home of the City of London Corporation. One light, run with Bunsen cells, was positioned outside each window, due to the fumes. The operating cost of each light was £3 per hour. Naser al-Din Shah Qajar was the Shah of Persia during the second half of the nineteenth century. During his reign, he toured Europe three times, in 1873, 1878, and 1889. It was during the 1873 trip that the mayor and the Corporation of the City of London gave a banquet in the Shah's honour. Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone arranged for the queen to entertain the Shah during the 1873 visit. Queen Victoria did not attend the banquet of 20 June 1873, which was primarily a business occasion. The elaborate preparations for the banquet included not only the costly lighting scheme, but also a gilded, illustrated menu (pictured).|$|R
40|$|Natural {{weathering}} has a {{detrimental effect}} on the hydrophobic nature of coal, which in turn can influence clean-coal recovery during flotation. Few techniques are available that can establish the quality of coal surfaces and that have a short analysis time to provide input for process control. Luminescence emissions which can be quantified with an optical <b>microscope</b> and <b>photometer</b> system, are measurably influenced by degree of weathering {{as well as by}} mild storage deterioration. In addition, {{it has been shown that}} when vitrinite is irradiated with a relatively high intensity flux of violet- or ultraviolet- light in the presence of air, photo-oxidation of the surface occurs. The combination of measuring the change in luminescence emission intensity with degree of surface oxidation provided the impetus for the current investigation. The principal aim of this research was to determine whether clear correlations could be established among surface oxygen functionality, hydrophobicity induced by photo-oxidation, and measurements of luminescence intensity and alteration. If successful, the project would result in quantitative luminescence techniques based on optical microscopy that would provide a measure of the changes in surface properties as a function of oxidation and relate them to coal cleanability. Two analytical techniques were designed to achieve these goals. Polished surfaces of vitrain bands or a narrow size fraction of powdered vitrain concentrates were photo-oxidized using violet or ultraviolet light fluxes and then changes in surface properties and chemistry were measured using a variety of near-surface analytical techniques. Results from this investigation demonstrate that quantitative luminescence intensity measurements can be performed on fracture surfaces of bituminous rank coals (vitrains) and that the data obtained do reveal significant variations depending upon the level of surface oxidation. Photo-oxidation induced by violet or ultraviolet light fluxes does result in a progressive and significant increase in the amount of near-surface oxygen concentration at about the same level regardless of bituminous coal rank. These incremental changes in oxygen concentration appear to lower the hydrophobicity as shown by contact angle measurements on polished surfaces. Although this influence diminished as coal rank increased, the level of oxygen uptake was about the same, suggesting that the type of oxygen functionality formed during oxidation may be of great importance in modifying surface hydrophobicity. Changes in functional-group chemistry, measured by a variety of near-surface techniques, showed a general increase in the concentration of carbonyl-containing groups while those of CH{sub 2 } groups decreased. All of these observations follow the trends observed in previous investigations of naturally weathered coals. The photo-oxidation technique also resulted in the development of phenolic, ester and anhydride moieties instead of the expected emplacement of carboxylic acid groups which are normally associated with naturally weathered coals. The importance of this observation is that esters and anhydrides would result in a more hydrophobic surface in comparison to the more hydrophilic surface resulting from acid functionality. This observation is consistent with the results of film flotation of UV-irradiated powdered vitrain in which floatability was generally observed to increase with increasing photo- oxidation...|$|R

The cationic cyanine dye 3, 3 ′-diheptyloxacarbocyanine iodide [DiOC 7 (3) ] accumulated in mitochondria within 15 to 30 minutes without appreciable staining of other protoplasmic constituents. The number, shape, and {{movement of the}} fluorescent mitochondria could be seen readily, and the fluorescence intensity of the mitochondria could be monitored with a <b>microscope</b> <b>photometer.</b> Fluorescence was eliminated in 1 to 5 minutes by the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) indicating that maintenance of dye concentration was dependent on the inside-negative transmembrane potential maintained by functional mitochondria. Fluorescence of prestained mitochondria was enhanced within 5 to 10 minutes after addition of 0. 1 millimolar kinetin to cells. The fluorescence in kinetintreated cells was dissipated by CCCP. These results suggest that kinetin interacted with respiratory processes resulting in higher potential across the mitochondrial membrane...|$|E
40|$|A <b>microscope</b> <b>photometer</b> with a {{computer-controlled}} scanning {{stage was}} used to map the distribution of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity in transverse sections of skeletal muscle fibres of pigs from 9 to 29 weeks of age. Absorbance due to SDH activity was measured in successive concentric zones that converged on the central axis of the muscle fibre. In all fibres, there was less SDH activity in the axis of the fibre than in {{the periphery of the}} fibre. In fibres with strong adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity and weak overall SDH activity, the radial gradient of SDH activity remained constant as fibres grew in cross-sectional area. However, in fibres with weak ATPase and strong SDH and in fibres with strong ATPase and strong SDH, the radial gradient of SDH activity increased as fibres grew larger. Changes in radial gradients were due to both decreased SDH activity in the axis and to increased SDH activity in the periphery. In all three fibre types, the overall SDH activity per fibre increase...|$|E
40|$|Evidence for apical sodium proton {{exchange}} in macula densa cells. These studies {{were performed to}} determine if changes in luminal sodium chloride concentration ([NaCl]) might alter macula densa intracellular pH. Isolated thick ascending limbs with attached glomeruli were bathed in a 150 mM NaCl Ringer's solution and perfused in vitro with a 25 mM NaCl solution; N-methyl-D-glucamine cyclamate was used to substitute for NaCl. Macula densa cells were loaded with BCECF and intracellular pH was monitored using a <b>microscope</b> based-dual excitation <b>photometer</b> system. Control intracellular pH for all experiments in which tubules were initially perfused with 25 mM NaCl averaged 7. 22 ± 0. 06; N = 28. Increasing luminal [NaCl] from 25 to 150 mM elevated macula densa pH by 0. 15 ± 0. 03 (N = 6; P < 0. 05) while increasing just luminal [Na] from 25 to 150 mM alkalinized macula densa cells by 0. 17 ± 0. 05 (N = 6; P < 0. 05). In addition, there was a highly significant linear relationship between luminal [Na] and intracellular pH between 25 and 150 mM NaCl. Other studies were performed to assess the effects of amiloride, an inhibitor of Na:H exchange, on macula densa intracellular pH. Addition of amiloride, to the 25 mM NaCl perfusate acidified macula densa cells by 0. 09 ± 0. 03 (N = 6; P < 0. 001) and significantly attenuated the increase in pH obtained when luminal [NaCl] was raised from 25 to 150 mM. Other studies evaluated the effects of inhibition of Na: 2 Cl:K cotransport on macula densa pH. Furosemide (50 µm) alkalinized macula densa pH by 0. 11 ± 0. 02 (N = 5; P < 0. 01) {{in the presence of}} 25 mM NaCl in the lumen whereas amiloride entirely reversed the furosemide-induced alkaninization in these cells. These results demonstrate that changes in either luminal [NaCl] or furosemide-sensitive NaCl transport can alter macula densa intracellular pH presumably by varying the Na gradient across the apical membrane. The results of these studies are consistent with the existence of an apical Na:H antiporter in macula densa cells...|$|R
40|$|A gel film {{technique}} was adopted for kinetic enzyme activity determination in single cells using cryostat sections {{by means of}} a <b>microscope</b> <b>photometer.</b> The main principle of the method is a comparative activity determination, based on biposi-tional recording of initial reaction kinetics in two preselected measuring fields in the same tissue section. Systematic model experiments were performed to prove the fulfillment of the following conditions: (a) validity of Beer’s law; (b) optimal con-centrations of substrates, cosubstrates and dye within the reaction film, including evidence that the reaction rate is not limited by insufficient diffusion of these com-pounds; (c) proportionality between local enzyme concentration or thickness of tissue sections and the recorded reaction rate; and (d) specificity of the method as demonstrated by studying reaction rates {{in the absence of the}} substrate as well as in the presence of substrate and a specific inhibitor. The validity of the method was also examined by comparing the levels of succinate dehydrogenase activity in vari-ous rat tissues, as measured microphotometrically, with the enzyme levels as deter-mined in homogenates.

30|$|The {{structure}} and chemical composition of coal alter regularly along with structural deformation {{due to the}} differences in the property, mode, and intensity of stress and the deformational environment. Moreover, the physical properties of TDC reservoirs vary significantly (Ju 2003; Ju et al. 2005 a). Therefore, comprehensive studies on stress action, strain environment, physical and chemical structures of TDC and physical properties of TDC reservoirs are of great help in better understanding the theoretical basis for the exploration and evaluation of CBM resources and the prevention and control of coal and gas outbursts. In this paper, we discussed the structure of tectonically deformed metamorphic coals and the physical properties of TDC reservoirs using integrative techniques such as the optical <b>microscope</b> <b>photometer,</b> X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), coal vitrinite reflectance (Ro, max) analysis, low-temperature nitrogen gas adsorption and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Through comparing different mechanisms of TDC from different coal mines, we built the relationships between the macromolecular {{structure and}} the physical properties of TDC and explained how the primary deformation mechanisms are for these TDC.|$|E
40|$|Electroporation {{involves}} {{the application of}} an electric field pulse that creates transient aqueous pathways in lipid bilayer membranes. Transport through these pathways can occur by different mechanisms during and after a pulse. To determine the time scale of transport and the mechanism(s) by which it occurs, efflux of a fluorescent molecule, calcein, across erythrocyte ghost membranes was measured with a fluorescence <b>microscope</b> <b>photometer</b> with millisecond time resolution during and after electroporation pulses several milliseconds in duration. One of four outcomes was typically observed. Ghosts were: (1) partially emptied of calcein, involving efflux primarily after the pulse; (2) completely emptied of calcein, involving efflux primarily after the pulse; (3) completely emptied of calcein, involving efflux both {{during and after the}} pulse; or (4) completely emptied of calcein, involving efflux primarily during the pulse. Partial emptying, involving significant efflux during the pulse, was generally not observed. We conclude that under some conditions transport caused by electroporation occurs predominantly by electrophoresis and/or electroosmosis during a pulse, although under other conditions transport occurs in part or almost completely by diffusion within milliseconds to seconds after a pulse...|$|E
40|$|Changes in refractility {{and optical}} density {{occurring}} in individual spores of Bacillus cereus T and B. megaterium QM B 1551 during germination were investigated {{by use of}} a Zeiss <b>microscope</b> <b>photometer.</b> The curves revealed that the germination process in single spores had two distinct phases; an initial rapid phase {{was followed by a}} second slower phase. Under the experimental condition employed, the first phase of germination of B. cereus spores lasted for approximately 75 ± 15 sec, whereas the second phase lasted for 3 to 4. 5 min. In B. megaterium spores, the first phase was observed to last for approximately 2 min and the second phase for more than 7 min. The duration of the second phase was dependent on conditions employed for germination. The kinetics of the first phase were strikingly similar under all conditions of physiological germination. Time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy of germinating spores also revealed the biphasic nature of germination. It was postulated that the first phase represents changes induced by an initial partial hydration of the spore and release into the medium of dipicolinic acid, whereas the second phase reflects degradation of the cortex and hydration of the core...|$|E
40|$|Osteoclasts {{isolated}} from the endosteum of 2. 5 to 3 -week chick tibia were cultured on glass coverslips or natural CaC 03 (Tridacna) wafers for 2 and 4 days. The cells {{were exposed to the}} pH-dependent dye, acridine orange, and fluorescence was measured by a light <b>microscope</b> <b>photometer.</b> Fluorescence intensity values were higher in cells adherent to Tridacna wafers than in those incubated on glass after 2 and 4 days of culture (three and two-fold, respectively). Moreover, osteoclasts on Tridacna wafers were more flattened and were found to produce resorption pits. Acid production by osteoclasts cultured on Tridacna wafers was stimulated with 10 - 8 M parathyroid hormone and inhibited with 10 - 7 M acetazolamide or 10 - 7 M hydroxybenezoyl thiophene sulfonamide, as shown by changes in intensity of acridine orange fluorescence after 30, 60 and 120 minutes of treatment. These results indicate that osteoclasts cultured on natural CaC 03 wafers mimic the behavior of osteoclasts cultured on other substrates. Further, the capacity to acidify was enhanced in cells cultured on CaC 03 wafers. These results indicate that natural CaC 03 Tridacna wafers provide a suitable substrate for osteoclasts in culture and demonstrate that carbonic anhydrase plays a role in carbonated substrate resorption...|$|E

Tissue samples were routinely processed and three-step indirect immunohistochemical method {{was used for the}} detection of Bcl- 2 protein. End-point cytophotometry was performed with computer-controlled <b>microscope</b> <b>photometer</b> with a scanning table and the mean relative absorbance of the final product of peroxidase reaction was determined and taken as a measure of Bcl- 2 expression. The morphometric evaluation was carried out from the TV display using Weibel s universal hexagonal raster and we determined the relative volume of Bcl- 2 positive structures in the various zones of the embryonal kidney. The aim of our research was mapping of the Bcl- 2 occurrence in the developing kidney of human embryos and fetuses. The Bcl- 2 protein is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and its effect is antiapoptotic. The highest Bcl- 2 expression was proved in the cells of metanephrogenic blastema. The lower occurrence of Bcl- 2 positive cells was demonstrated in proximal tubules anlages and it was almost on the borderline of detection in branches of ureteral bud. In the fetal period the marked Bcl- 2 expression was maintained in the epithelial cells of proximal tubules anlages...|$|E

The technique was based on the detection of aldehyde functions {{with the use of the}} Schiff's reagent. The study was carried out on bromobenzene-intoxicated mice, which generally exhibit levels of lipid peroxidation considerably higher than those observed in the case of other hepatotoxins. Liver sections from control animals were unstainable by the reagent, while sections from bromobenzene-poisoned mice showed a purple stain of various intensity, unhomogeneously distributed, sometimes with a mediolobular localization. Microphotometric measurements were performed at 565 nm by means of a computer-controlled <b>microscope</b> <b>photometer.</b> The ratios of Schiff-positive area relative to total section area, as well as the total extinctions referred to 100 sq Î¼ of the sections, showed a high correlation with the corresponding hepatic contents of malonic dialdehyde, chosen as biochemical index of lipid peroxidation. In vitro studies in which liver sections were incubated in the presence of NADPH-Fe 2 +, showed a Schiff positivity which increased with the incubation time, confirming the reliability of the histochemical method. Another procedure, based on the use of 2 -OH- 3 -naphtoic acid hydrazide coupled with fast blue B, was also developed and proved to be possibly more sensitive than Schiff's reagent in the detection of lipid peroxidation in liver tissue...|$|E
40|$|Marek's {{disease is}} a {{naturally}} occurring lymphoproliferative disease of chickens which {{is caused by a}} herpesvirus (Marek's disease virus, MDV). To determine whether the cells in Marek's disease lymphomas are homogeneous or consist of several lymphocytic subpopulations, lymphoid cells from a MDV infected group of chickens were compared with lymphoid cells from vaccinated chickens and uninfected chickens using computer assisted microphotometric analysis (CAMA). CAMA is a quantitative technique capable of differentiating cell populations based upon slight differences in the chromatin and cytoplasmic textures of stained cells. Lymphoma cells, splenocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were stained with Papanicolaou stain and scanned on a Leitz MPVII <b>microscope</b> <b>photometer</b> operated on line to a PDP 11 / 45 computer. Two populations of lymphoid cell were detected in MD lesions using CAMA. One of these populations had features which were different from lymphoid cells from uninfected chickens and were termed "altered" cells. The other population had features which were similar to uninfected lymphocytes. Features were identified and selected that would classify cells as "altered" or "unaltered" and used to derive a decision rule to classify cells from other lymphoid populations. The decision rule classified up to 75 % of cells from different lymphomas as "altered" cells. CAMA results were compared with clinical data and immunological data to quantitate T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and MATSA (Marek's Disease Tumor Specific Antigen) positive cells. Results showed that there was a high correlation (r = 0. 79) between the percentage of "altered" cells detected using CAMA and the percentage of MATSA positive cells.
