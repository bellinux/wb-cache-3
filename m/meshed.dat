For double-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> durations, 4, 6 and 8 <b>mesh</b> periods have <b>mesh</b> stiffness reduction caused by slight pitting, moderate pitting and severe pitting, respectively. The maximum averaged <b>mesh</b> stiffness reduction in a double-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> duration is 1.57 %, 4.26 % and 19.02 % corresponding to slight pitting, moderate pitting and severe pitting, respectively. While for single-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> durations, 3, 5 and 7 <b>mesh</b> periods experience <b>mesh</b> stiffness reduction corresponding to slight pitting, moderate pitting and severe pitting, respectively. The maximum averaged <b>mesh</b> stiffness reduction in a single-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> duration is 11.61 %, 55.33 % and 55.83 % related to slight pitting, moderate pitting and severe pitting, respectively. For each <b>mesh</b> period, the stiffness reduction in the single-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> duration is larger than that in the double-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> duration for two reasons: (a) the pitting mostly appear around the pitch line and the pitch line lies on the single-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> duration, and (b) the perfect gear has a smaller averaged <b>mesh</b> stiffness in the single-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> duration than the double-tooth-pair <b>meshing</b> duration.
