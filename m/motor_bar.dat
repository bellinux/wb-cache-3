Summary The paper {{presents the}} computerised {{system for the}} diagnosis of the rotor bars of an induction electrical motor. The solution relies on the processing of the measured stator current and application of the Support Vector Machine as the classifier. The important point is the generation of the diagnostic features {{on the basis of}} which the SVM classifier undertakes its decision whether or not the bars are faulty. The most important problem is concerned with the generation of the diagnostic features, on the basis of which the recognition {{of the state of the}} rotor bars is done. In our approach, we use the spectral information of the stator current, limited to a strictly specified region. The selected features form the input vector applied to the single class Support Vector Machine, responsible for recognition of the fault. The results of the numerical experiments are presented and discussed in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Induction <b>motor</b> <b>bar</b> {{breakages}} {{have been}} increasingly {{studied in the}} last decades because of economic interests in developing techniques that permit on-line, non-invasive, early detection of motor faults in power plants. This work is specifically focused on broken bar detection and fault severity assessment in three phase power cage motors fed by non-sinusoidal voltage sources. In this work some new fault indicators for rotor bar breakages detection in squirrel cage induction motors are proposed, mathematically developed and experimentally proved. They {{are based on the}} sidebands of phase current upper harmonics, and they are well suited especially for converter-fed induction motors. The ratios I(7 - 2 s) f/I 5 f and I(5 + 2 s) f/I 7 f, I(13 - 2 s) f/I 11 f and I(11 + 2 s) f/I 13 f are examples of such new indicators, and they are not dependent on load torque and drive inertia, as classical indicators do. Their frequency-dependence has been also examined both theoretically and experimentally, and it was found less remarkable with respect to other indicators. Moreover, their values increase linearly with the quantity of consecutive broken bars, almost for not too much advanced faults; on 4 -poles motors they were found quietly like the per-unit number of broken bars (ratio on total bar number). An original formulation is presented for motor mathematical modeling, based on the Generalized Symmetrical Components Theory, for sidebands amplitude computation. A complete motor model (involving all the elementary machine electrical circuits, as stator belts and rotor mesh loops) has been used for computer simulations; the same model was then transformed by using some complex Fortescue’s matrices to obtain a steady-state linear solution, solvable for stator and rotor currents, in healthy and faulty conditions. By exploiting the model, the formal definition of a set of new broken bar indicators was finally obtained. Machine simulations carried out by running the complete numerical model confirmed the accuracy of the model, and the theoretical previsions. Experimental work was performed by using a square-wave inverter-fed motor with an appositely prepared cage, for easy testing with increasing number of broken bars and without motor dismounting. Moreover, extensive experimentation was carried out on three industrial motors with different power and poles number, with increasing load, frequency and fault gravity for methodology validation. Finally, the ideas exposed in this work led to a patent application, owned by the University of Rome “Sapienza”. Ministry of Defense, General Direction of Naval Armaments (NAVARM...|$|E

The acoustic camera comprises a set of microphones arranged in a pre-defined, carefully designed and manufactured shape. The great advantage of acoustic cameras is the sound measurements can be used to pin-point the exact location of the sound source in a monitored scene. This, in turn allows for the frequencies of interest to be separated from the background noise. The paper presents the result of comparing the acoustic camera outputs from two induction motor – a healthy motor and a motor suffering from a broken rotor bar fault.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{discriminate}} small changes for early fault diagnosis of rotating machines, condition monitoring {{demands that the}} measurement of instantaneous angular speed (IAS) of the machines be as accurate as possible. This paper develops the theoretical basis and practical implementation of IAS data acquisition and IAS estimation when noise influence is included. IAS data is modelled as a frequency modulated signal of which the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved by using a high-resolution encoder. From this signal model and analysis, optimal configurations for IAS data collection are addressed for high accuracy IAS measurement. Simultaneously, a method based on analytic signal concept and fast Fourier transform is also developed for efficient and accurate estimation of IAS. Finally, a fault diagnosis is carried out on an electric induction motor driving system using IAS measurement. The diagnosis results show that using a high-resolution encoder and a long data stream can achieve noise reduction by more than 10 dB in the frequency range of interest, validating the model and algorithm developed.

50|$|The stator of an {{induction}} motor consists of poles carrying supply current to induce {{a magnetic field}} that penetrates the rotor. To optimize {{the distribution of the}} magnetic field, windings are distributed in slots around the stator, with the magnetic field having the same number of north and south poles. Induction motors are most commonly run on single-phase or three-phase power, but two-phase motors exist; in theory, {{induction motor}}s can have any number of phases. Many single-phase motors having two windings can be viewed as two-phase motors, since a capacitor is used to generate a second power phase 90° from the single-phase supply and feeds it to the second motor winding. Single-phase motors require some mechanism to produce a rotating field on startup. Cage induction <b>motor</b> rotor's conductor <b>bars</b> are typically skewed to avoid magnetic locking.|$|R
40|$|On-line {{induction}} {{machine condition monitoring}} techniques have been used widely in the detection of <b>motor</b> broken rotor <b>bars</b> for decades. Research has found that when broken bars occur in the machine rotor, the anomaly of electromagnetic field in the air gap will cause two sideband frequency components presenting in the stator current spectrum. Therefore, identification of these sideband frequencies {{can be used as}} a convenient and reliable approach to broken rotor bar fault diagnosis. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a conventional spectral analysis method used in this application. However, the use of DFT has several limitations. The most important one among them is the restriction of frequency resolution by window length. Due to this limitation, the accuracy of broken rotor bar detection can be highly affected in cases such as light machine load and limited data records. However, Prony's method for spectral analysis has the ability of overcoming the restriction of data window length on the frequency resolution, from which the DFT suffers. Such feature makes Prony's method a promising choice for broken rotor bar diagnosis when the machine is operating under light or varying load, or when only restricted data is available. In this thesis, I have demonstrated the implementation of this technique in the induction <b>motor</b> broken rotor <b>bar</b> detection, revealed its better performance than DFT in terms of maintaining high resolution in frequency domain whilst using a much shorter window, and analyzed the influential factors to the method of Prony Analysis (PA).
