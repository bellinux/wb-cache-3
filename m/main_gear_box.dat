40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modelling approach for predicting the internal dynamic behaviour of ball bearings under high moment loads. This type of loading {{is a specific}} feature of helicopter <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> because of special design rules and the high structural flexibility of such systems. The ball bearing model proposed here {{is not limited to}} planar systems and incorporates several different phenomena such as contact deformation, elastohydrodynamic contact, internal clearance and cage run-out. The cage–race interaction is treated as a hybrid short journal model, which ensures continuity of the contact force at the transition from the hydrodynamic to metal-to-metal regime. In the dynamic analysis of such a severely loaded bearing, the dependence of the shaft-to-inner-ring force on inner race position cannot be neglected. An equivalent viscoelastic hinge joint has been developed, it produces an additional force that represents the overall rigidity of the system. The stiffness parameters of the joint are identified using global finite element simulations. A ball bearing loaded with two different moments is chosen as an example. Relevant results concerning the internal dynamic behaviour are given. The predicted cage trajectory has been compared to experimental observations, and good agreement has been found...|$|R

Needle bearings were used on the nutating plate pins. The results of the analysis indicate that the required load capacity of the pin bearings and the speed of the nutating plate bearings were beyond the state-of-the-art capacity of rolling-element bearings. The analysis further indicates that the nutating plate drive is less efficient, and results in a higher weight per horsepower than a conventional planetary helicopter transmission with similar design specifications...|$|R

50|$|Power is {{transmitted}} from the engine to the drive system through drive belts. Originally, the R22 used four separate v-belts running on multi-groove sheaves. This system proved problematic, as individual belts would sometimes roll over in their groove and fail. As a temporary measure, in 1982, R22 operators received a kit from Robinson that was installed in the cockpit and on the belt tension actuator, isolating the tensioning circuits and locking the clutch/drive system at take-off tension. The problem was ultimately solved by replacing the four individual v-belts with two dual v-belts. The upper, driven sheave is mounted on the main/tail rotor drive shaft incorporating flexible couplings, and is raised and lowered relative to the engine-mounted, driving sheave {{by means of a}} belt tension actuator. During shutdown, the actuator is used to lower the upper sheave to loosen the drive belts. For startup, the engine is started with the belts loose, allowing the engine to run without spinning the rotor system. Immediately after engine start, the clutch switch located in the cockpit is closed by the pilot, powering the actuator to slowly raise the upper sheave to flight position, which tightens the belts. The actuator is thereafter controlled by pressure-sensing column springs, automatically maintaining proper belt tension during flight as the belts wear and stretch. The shaft on which the upper sheave is mounted drives both the main and tail rotors; the <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> delivers power to the main rotor shaft through a set of splash-lubricated spiral bevel gears.|$|E

It is indicated that although improvements can be made in noise reduction at the source, a soundproofing treatment isolating the passenger from the noise source is necessary. Soundproofing treatments installed and optimized include: (1) an acoustic screen using the weight effect to isolate the passenger from the noise source; (2) a damping treatment to limit the conversion of the vibratory energy into acoustic energy; and (3) an absorbing treatment achieved either through HELMHOLTZ resonators or through a glass wool blanket to limit the propagation of acoustic waves and the wave reflection effects in the cabin. The application of treatments at the source and the optimization of the sound barriers improved the noise level by about 30 db...|$|E
50|$|In a {{standard}} 4WD design, the separate four wheels {{are allowed to}} rotate at different speeds {{through the use of}} differentials. This is important for cornering to eliminate binding. In a Mini 4WD, this is not {{a standard}} design and is only achieved through optional one-way wheel sets. Thus, the standard Mini 4WD utilizes a direct drive to all 4 wheels even around corners. Chassis' are designed to hold the motor and batteries in differing arrangements. There are sideways motors positioned in the rear. There are sideways motors positions in the front. There are in-line motors positioned in the middle. Rear and Front position motor designs position batteries {{side by side in the}} front or rear of the motor placement. Middle position motor designs position the batteries straddling either side of the motor. Rear and front position motor designs utilize a propeller rod extending from the <b>main</b> motor <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> that drives both the front and rear axles.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The subject {{project is}} also an attempt to use modern day {{analysis}} software to optimize mechanical designs. Particularly the software {{has been instrumental in}} ideating modifications to address repeated failures encountered in a shaft analyzing and optimizing design. The genesis of the project lies in repeated failures encountered in eccentric shaft of <b>Main</b> Drive <b>Gear</b> <b>Box</b> (MDGB) of a pilger mill. The failure mode and root cause had been identified by NFC. The project has analyzed deeply the existing conditions, simulated and validated results for existing shaft to get optimum solution. The progressive deterioration of the strength of a material or structural component during service such that failure can occur at much lower stress levels than the ultimate stress of the material. Fatigue is a dynamic phenomenon that initiates small (micro) cracks in the material or component and causes them to grow into large (macro) cracks.

50|$|During an {{official}} {{visit to the}} United States in September 1959, Nikita Khrushchev took a flight in the S-58 presidential helicopter {{for the first time}} and was reportedly extremely impressed. On Khrushchev's return, he ordered the creation of a similar helicopter, which was to be ready for the return visit by the American president, to save face. A luxury version of the Mi-4 was quickly created and Khrushchev took an inspection flight, during which Mikhail Mil proposed that his helicopter in development was more suitable. However, it would be necessary to have a second engine for reliability. This gave Mikhail Mil the power under the orders of Khrushchev to build the original two-engined helicopter, which for the first time in Soviet history would need purpose-built turbine engines, rather than those adapted from fixed wing aircraft (as in the Mil Mi-6 and the first prototype V-8) and an entirely new <b>main</b> rotor <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> that would be designed in-house for the first time. In May 1960, the order was given for Mikhail Mil to create his twin engine helicopter. The Sergei Isotov Design Bureau accepted the task of creating the engines.|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{operation}} of the rotor, the helicopter is subject to important vibration levels affecting namely the fatigue of the mechanical parts and the passenger comfort. Suspensions between the <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> (MGB) and the fuselage help to filter theses problematic vibrations. Their design can be difficult since the filtering should be efficient for different types of external forces (pumping force and roll/pitch torque) which may appear during the flight. As passive solutions classically show their limits, intelligent active solutions are proposed so that the filtering can be adjusted according to the vibration sources. Such studies still suffer from a lack of tools and methods, firstly, necessary to the design of complex mechanical systems (due to their multi-phase multi-physics multi-interaction characteristic, [...] .) and secondly, to develop of an intelligent joint. The main objective of this chapter is to provide a methodology for designing and analyzing an intelligent joint using an energetic representation approach: the multibond graph (MBG). This method is applied here to a complex mechanical system with closed kinematic chains (CKC) which is the joint between the <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> (MGB) and the aircraft structure of a helicopter. Firstly, the MBG method is analyzed. Secondly, after a brief state of art of the MGB-Fuselage joint, developments focus on the 2 D and 3 D modeling of the MGB-Fuselage joint with a MBG approach. The 20 -sim software is used to conduct the simulation of bond graph.

To the latter application, also control systems working in time domain were developed and adapted. After promising laboratory results and as extension of the original planning, the active struts were tested succfessfully also on a BK 117 in ground runs. The technology will be further developed in the Aeronautical Research Programme ADASYS II. The acoustic efficiency of resonators was also tested on the shrouded tail rotor (Fenestron) of the EC 135. To that purpose, models were applied at DC Ottobrunn and in the wind tunnel of the Technical University RWTH Aachen. The results show beneficial effects at low forward speed, typical for helicopter approach. Each of the described research results represents an important contribution to the goal to attainlow cabin noise levels. For a combined application of all measures mentioned above, already today the accomplishment of the targeted noise level below 80 dB(A) can be assessed. For that however, the individual technologies still have to undergo a maturing process. (orig.)

An important aspect in the design of machine tool transmission is to keep the cost and volume of the <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> to a minimum. The probabilistic approach to design has been considered to be more rational compared to the conventional design approach based on the factor of safety.

40|$|This is {{a thesis}} about {{the control of}} {{magnetic}} gears. A decade ago (2001) the first modern prototype magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> was constructed using rare earth magnets (NdFeB). Magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> have some desirable properties not found in their mechanical <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> counterparts, these include: contact-less torque transmission, lubrication-free, reduced noise and vibration, and non-destructive torque overload capability. Hitherto, no detailed investigation or analysis has been conducted {{on the effects of}} using a magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> in place of a mechanical <b>gear</b> <b>box.</b> As will be demonstrated in this thesis, magnetic gears possess a number of undesirable properties which must be given due consideration when designing speed and position controllers. In particular, unlike mechanical <b>gear</b> <b>boxes,</b> magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> have extremely low torsional rigidity. Furthermore, the torque transfer characteristic is fundamentally nonlinear and magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> have the potential to ‘slip’. On the one hand, ‘slipping’ is a great benefit as a non-destructive ‘torque fuse’; but on the other, this represents a consequential loss of control. This thesis examines the control issues that arise {{through the use of a}} specially constructed magnetic coupling integrated into an experimental test rig. The development of a linearized mathematical model of the experimental magnetic coupling is used to derive optimized classical controllers for speed and position, demonstrating outstanding theoretical and experimental results. To compensate for the possibility of ‘slip’, a methodology is presented for the detection and recovery from what is defined as ‘pole-slip’ in a magnetic coupling. To avert ‘pole-slip’, a model predictive control (MPC) scheme is developed that prevents over-torque pole-slipping. Feedback linearization is considered for a nonlinear model of the magnetic coupling and nonlinear control laws and state transformations are derived to produce perfect linearization, for both speed and position control, over the entire operating range of the experimental magnetic coupling...|$|R
