50|$|MGME1 is a 344 {{amino acids}} long protein {{belonging}} to the PD-(D/E)XK family of nucleases. It localizes to mitochondria where {{it is important for}} maintenance of the mitochondrial genome. Loss of function mutations in MGME1 lead to defects in mitochondrial DNA, including mitochondrial DNA depletion, duplications, deletions and increased replication intermediates. Also, there is an accumulation of 7S DNA, a short single stranded linear DNA strand. MGME1 deficiency in humans leads to <b>multisystemic</b> mitochondrial disease.|$|E
50|$|Porcine {{parvovirus}} (PPV) causes reproductive {{failure of}} swine characterized by embryonic and fetal infection and death, {{usually in the}} absence of outward maternal clinical signs. The disease develops mainly when seronegative dams are exposed oronasally to the virus anytime during about the first half of gestation, and conceptuses are subsequently infected transplacentally before they become immunocompetent. There is no definitive evidence that infection of swine other than during gestation is of any clinical or economic significance. The virus is ubiquitous among swine throughout the world and is enzootic in most herds that have been tested. Diagnostic surveys have indicated that PPV is the major infectious cause of embryonic and fetal death. In addition to its direct causal role in reproductive failure, PPV can potentiate the effects of porcine circovirus type II (PCV2) infection in the clinical course of postweaning <b>multisystemic</b> wasting syndrome (PMWS).|$|E
50|$|Those with ASPD may stay in {{treatment}} only {{as required by}} an external source, such as parole conditions. Residential programs that provide a carefully controlled environment of structure and supervision along with peer confrontation have been recommended. There has been some research on the treatment of ASPD that indicated positive results for therapeutic interventions. Psychotherapy also known as talk therapy is found to help treat patients with ASPD.Schema therapy is also being investigated {{as a treatment for}} ASPD. A review by Charles M. Borduin features the strong influence of <b>Multisystemic</b> therapy (MST) that could potentially improve this imperative issue. However, this treatment requires complete cooperation and participation of all family members. Some studies have found that the presence of ASPD does not significantly interfere with treatment for other disorders, such as substance abuse, although others have reported contradictory findings.|$|E
50|$|Postweaning <b>multisystemic</b> wasting {{syndrome}} ("PMWS") {{is the classic}} PCVD entity, caused by PCV-2. PCV-2 has a near universal distribution - present in most pig herds. In contrast, PMWS is more sporadic in its distribution. Experimental induction of PMWS has not been achieved by PCV-2 infection alone, using infectious DNA clones of the virus or a pure form of PCV-2 derived from infectious DNA clones. Therefore, {{it is assumed that}} PMWS is a multifactorial disease. PCV-2 is necessary but not sufficient for the development of PMWS. However, viral infection by itself tends to cause only mild disease, and co-factors such as other infections or immunostimulation seem necessary for development of severe disease.1 For example, concurrent infection with porcine parvovirus or PRRS virus, or immunostimulation lead to increased replication of PCV-2 and more severe disease in PCV-2-infected pigs. There is no significant correlation of the disease with virus sequence variation with affected and control pigs.|$|E

5000|$|In 1954 he spearheaded a {{successful}} government campaign to stem typhoid epidemic in present-day Kenya and Uganda. [...] Once more his expertise was {{needed by the}} colonial administration in Kenya and the British Colonial Medical Services in London, to spearhead efforts to stem a major epidemic outbreak of another disease, typhoid or enteric fever—a fatal <b>multisystemic</b> disease. The North Kavirondo region of Mt. Elgon in Kenya—the Bungoma realm (presently Bungoma County in the former Western Province of Kenya) was one of hardest hit areas. The disease was wreaking havoc amidst the ethnic Bukusu population; threatening to decimate the ethnic group. Yet again, he employed his charisma, vigilant statesmanship, and technical functional acumen to effectually stem the epidemic and save the local population from imminent decimation. His achievement was recognized accordingly among the Bukusu people who denoted him a great leader and healer by officially crowning him with an honorary title of “omukasa”—a paramount Bukusu chieftain.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the use of <b>multisystemic</b> treatment for treating juveniles with serious delinquency, as a new approach within the Saudi Arabian context. <b>Multisystemic</b> treatment addresses behaviour problems as multidetermined by interacting individual, family, school, peers, and community systems. This study attempted to determine the impact of the <b>multisystemic</b> therapy on the behaviour of young offenders with serious delinquency and in increasing their level of self-esteem and religious behaviour. The fieldwork was conducted in 2000 - 0 I in the Social Observation Home in Riyadh City. The project consisted of three parts: therapists training for one month, a treatment programme for three months and follow up, conducted in two periods of two months each, with a seven months interval. An experimental and control group, prepost test design was adopted. Twenty juveniles with serious delinquency (age 14 - 18) were assigned to each group. The experimental group received <b>multisystemic</b> treatment, and the control group received the Home's usual service (individual therapy). Outcomes were measured by, self-reports (Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory and Level of Religious Measurement), official misconducts, family relations, peer relations, school attendance & grades and observed religious practice. Qualitative information was obtained from six case studies (three experimental, three control) and from interviews with young offenders, their relatives and the Home staff. The results indicated greater gain and long-term positive impact on the behaviour of young offenders in the experimental than in the control group, on all measures. The improvement in self-esteem and religious practice in association with <b>multisystemic</b> treatment are especially noteworthy, as these factors have been subject to little or no previous investigation, and are particularly important in relation to delinquency in the Saudi context. It is concluded, that provided appropriate resources are allocated to the application, <b>multisystemic</b> treatment can be adapted to meet the unique cultural concerns of the Saudi context...|$|E

40|$|Background: Adolescent antisocial {{behaviour}} is a {{major health}} and social problem. Studies in the USA have shown that <b>multisystemic</b> therapy reduces such behaviour {{and the number of}} criminal offences committed by this group. However, findings outside the USA are equivocal. We aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of <b>multisystemic</b> therapy versus management as usual in the treatment of adolescent antisocial behaviour. Methods: We did an 18 month, multisite, pragmatic, randomised controlled, superiority trial in England. Eligible participants aged 11 - 17 years with moderate-to-severe antisocial behaviour had at least three severity criteria indicating past difficulties across several settings and one of five general inclusion criteria for antisocial behaviour. We randomly assigned families (1 : 1) using stochastic minimisation, stratifying for treatment centre, sex, age at enrolment to study, and age at onset of antisocial behaviour, to receive either management as usual or 3 - 5 months of <b>multisystemic</b> therapy followed by management as usual. Research assistants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation; the participants could not be masked. The primary outcome was out-of-home placement at 18 months. The primary analysis included all randomised participants for whom data were available. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN 77132214. Follow-up of the trial is still ongoing. Findings: Between Feb 4, 2010, and Sept 1, 2012, 1076 families were referred to nine multi-agency panels, 684 of whom were assigned to management as usual (n= 342) or <b>multisystemic</b> therapy followed by management as usual (n= 342). At 18 months, the proportion of participants in out-of-home placement was not significantly different between the groups (13 % [43 / 340] in the <b>multisystemic</b> therapy group vs 11 % [36 / 335] in the management-as-usual group; odds ratio 1 · 25, 95 % CI 0 · 77 - 2 · 05; p= 0 · 37). Interpretation: The findings do not support that <b>multisystemic</b> therapy should be used over management as usual as the intervention of choice for adolescents with moderate-to-severe antisocial behaviour.

40|$|Abstract. Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV 2) is {{the cause}} of postweaning <b>multisystemic</b> wasting {{syndrome}} (PMWS). The most common lesions of PMWS are lymphohistiocytic to granulomatous lymphadenitis, interstitial pneumonia and interstitial nephritis, with intracytoplasmic amphophilic botryoid inclusion bodies in macrophages. In addition to these typical changes, intracytoplasmic botryoid inclusion bodies were observed in bronchial, bronchial glandular, and renal tubular epithelium of several pigs from 4 different farms in Western and Eastern Canada. PCV 2 inclusion bodies were demonstrated to be located in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells by immunohistochemical staining for PCV 2 and cytokeratin antigens and by ultrastructural demonstration of viral particles in the inclusion bodies within renal tubular epithelium. Key words: Intracytoplasmic epithelial inclusion bodies; porcine circovirus 2 (PCV 2); postweaning <b>multisystemic</b> wasting syndrome (PMWS). Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV 2) is associated with several porcine disease entities, the first of which was initially described in Western Canada and named postweaning <b>multisystemic</b> wasting syndrome (PMWS). 4 – 6, 11, 12 Th...|$|E

40|$|Background: CHIP, {{the protein}} encoded by STUB 1, {{is a central}} {{component}} of cellular protein homeostasis and interacts with several key proteins involved in the pathogenesis of manifold neurodegenerative diseases. This {{gives rise to the}} hypothesis that mutations in STUB 1 might cause a far more <b>multisystemic</b> neurodegenerative phenotype than the previously reported cerebellar ataxia syndrome. Methods: Whole exome sequencing data-sets from n[*]=[*] 87 index subjects of two ataxia cohorts were screened for individuals with STUB 1 mutations. In-depth phenotyping by clinical evaluation and neuroimaging was performed in mutation carriers. Results: We identified four novel STUB 1 mutations in three affected subjects from two index families (frequency 2 / 87 [*]=[*] 2. 3 %). All three subjects presented with a severe <b>multisystemic</b> phenotype including severe dementia, spastic tetraparesis, epilepsy, and autonomic dysfunction in addition to cerebellar ataxia, plus hypogonadism in one index patient. Diffusion tensor imaging revealed degeneration of manifold supra- and infratentorial tracts. Conclusions: Our findings provide clinical and imaging support for the notion that CHIP is a crucial converging point of manifold neurodegenerative processes, corresponding with its universal biological function in neurodegeneration. Further, our data reveal the second STUB 1 family with ataxia plus hypogonadism reported so far, demonstrating that Gordon Holmes syndrome is indeed a recurrent manifestation of STUB 1. However, it does not present in isolation, but as part of a broad <b>multisystemic</b> neurodegenerative process. This supports the notion that STUB 1 disease should be conceptualized not by historical or clinical syndromic names, but as a variable <b>multisystemic</b> disease defined by disturbed function of the underlying STUB 1 gene, which translates into a multidimensional gradual spectrum of variably associated clinical signs and symptoms...|$|E
