Eidos <b>marketing</b> <b>manager</b> David Burton oversaw marketing efforts, which attempted {{to portray the}} character as attractive and pleasant. However, interaction with the press, especially those in Europe, resulted in less clothing depicted in promotional images. Concerned with diluting Croft's personality, Eidos avoided products it felt did not fit the character. Ian Livingstone, Eidos's product acquisition director, commented that the company declines most merchandising proposals. He stated that Eidos primarily focused on game development and viewed such promotion outside video games as exposure for the character. Following Square Enix's acquisition, Eidos's marketing duties were transferred to the Square Enix Europe subsidiary. As part of the second reboot, Crystal Dynamics planned to align all products, promotions, and media ventures with its {{new version of the}} character.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the sudden}} {{popularity}} of the Terrible Towel, Pittsburgh-area department stores sold out all gold and black hand towels. Because the hand towels were often sold as a set, with matching bath towels, stores were left with un-even sets. In the fall of 1978, Bernard Pollock, divisional <b>marketing</b> <b>manager</b> of Gimbel's Department Store {{came up with the}} idea of putting a Terrible Towel logo on hand towels and sold the idea to Cope. The first Terrible Towels hit the marketplace on December 20, 1978 at $6 apiece. Gimbel's could not stock them fast enough. Gimbel's has since gone out of business. The original version of The Terrible Towel was manufactured by Fieldcrest and distributed by St. Mary's Inc. of New York and was available in two colors: Gold and Black. The current manufacturer of the Towel is Little Earth Productions, Inc. of Pittsburgh, who took over from McArthur Towel & Sports Co. of Baraboo, Wisconsin in 2013. The current cost of a towel is approximately $12 (in May, 2017, at Steelers' online store).|$|E

A survey conducted with <b>marketing</b> <b>managers</b> investigated the criteria they apply when choosing between advertising creative suggestions, and the factors that they believe determine advertising campaign success. Criteria for evaluating advertising campaigns were assigned to the three scales of strategy, artistry, and originality with ‘artistry’ and ‘originality’ together comprising the ‘creativity’ component. Success factors related to product uniqueness, competition, the agency-client relationship, media selection, the nature of the market, financial and managerial resources, marketing objectives, message and creativity, and market research: 36 items for the 9 factors. The study confirmed that although <b>marketing</b> <b>managers</b> consider both strategy and creativity important when evaluating advertising campaign suggestions, they value appropriateness over originality. They believe their past successful campaigns were primarily the result of good strategy rather than of superior creativity, and do not admit to having been persuaded to abandon strategy by an agency’s winning creative idea. Whilst younger, more educated but less experienced <b>marketing</b> <b>managers</b> are more influenced by superior creative ideas, more experienced <b>marketing</b> <b>managers</b> are less prone to be swayed by these and are more inclined to adhere to agreed strategy...|$|R
