40|$|The {{structuring}} of planar waveguides with 2 D photonic crystals {{is promising}} {{for a whole}} new range of dense optoelectronics integrated components. In particular coherent multiple scattering can be utilised for the extreme manipulation of both spectral and temporal dispersion. However very little work yet exists showing how light in reality propagates through such structures. Many issues such as scattering loss, mode <b>mixing,</b> <b>polarisation</b> <b>mixing</b> and structure optimisation remain unresolved. These can only be addressed {{through the development of}} suitable tools which separate the different processes in the distinct spectral regions...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} consequences of quantum physics is quantum teleportation – the possibility to transfer quantum states over arbitrary distances. Since its theoretical introduction, teleportation has been demonstrated experimentally up to the distance of 143  km. In the original proposal two parties share a maximally entangled quantum state acting as a resource for the teleportation task. If, however, the state is influenced by decoherence, perfect teleportation can no longer be accomplished. Therefore, one of the current major challenges in accomplishing teleportation over long distances is to overcome the limitations imposed by decoherence and the subsequent mixedness of the resource state. Here we show that, in the presence of nonlocal memory effects, perfect quantum teleportation can be achieved even with <b>mixed</b> photon <b>polarisation</b> states. Our results imply that memory effects can be exploited in harnessing noisy quantum systems for quantum communication and that non-Markovianity is a resource for quantum information tasks.

40|$|The main {{motivation}} for our {{work has been}} a puzzling observation concerning quasars. No one expected the existence of correlations in the polarisation of visible light coming from objects separated by gigaparsecs, until they were first reported {{in the form of}} a redshift-dependent effect that has become more and more significant with the growth of the data sample. In close connection with the observational group, we have studied in detail the most widely considered scenario, involving axion-photon mixing in extragalactic magnetic fields. After a systematic investigation, we conclude that it is very unlikely that these observations can be accounted for by axion-like particles, given current data and constraints. We also derive new limits on the parameters describing these particles. This thesis gives in particular a detailed account of the consequences of axion-photon <b>mixing</b> on <b>polarisation,</b> studies the influence of averages over the frequency (including a wave-packet treatment of the mixing), and discusses the consequences of different magnetic-field morphologies.

40|$|Abstract. We {{review the}} {{relation}} between Casimir effect and geometry, emphasizing deviations from the commonly used Proximity Force Approximation (PFA). We use to this aim the scattering formalism which is nowadays the best tool available for accurate and reliable theory-experiment comparisons. We first recall the main lines of this formalism when the mirrors can be considered to obey specular reflection. We then discuss the more general case where non planar mirrors give rise to non-specular reflection with wavevectors and field <b>polarisations</b> <b>mixed.</b> The general formalism has already been fruitfully used for evaluating the effect of roughness on the Casimir force {{as well as the}} lateral Casimir force or Casimir torque appearing between corrugated surfaces.

40|$|Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) {{has been}} {{utilised}} {{in various forms}} in sensors for many years. It is usually based on angular or wavelength interrogation of the reflectivity minimum found with Transverse Magnetic (TM) light. However, as the SPR is traversed {{there is also a}} very rapid change in the phase of the reflected TM light there being no such change in the Transverse Electric (TE) light. Presented in the thesis a new SPR sensor has been developed that exploits this rapid change in optical phase. Linearly polarised light of <b>mixed</b> TM/TE <b>polarisation</b> is passed through a polarization modulator, which adds a small amplitude modulation to the polarisation. This modulated light is incident on a gold film 40 nm thick evaporated onto the base of a SF 2 prism in the Kretschmann-Raether, configuration. The coupling of the TM polarised light to the SPR is dependant on the properties of the dielectric medium adjacent to the gold film. The SPR shifts when this sensed medium undergoes a change in refractive index (or index or thickness if it is a bound analyte layer). This in turn causes a change in the reflected elliptically polarised light. The change of the resultant modulated polarisation dither is interrogated {{through the use of a}} phase sensitive detectors. Initially a simple photo diode coupled with a lock-in amplifier was used to monitor the modulated signal. This was expanded into an imaging technique by using two cameras (64 by 64 pixels) fabricated with the equivalent of a lock-in amplifier on each of the 4096 pixels. The spatial map of the modulation amplitude gives an optical phase differential image. By imaging in this way it is possible to produce a multi channel differential sensorEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceRCUKGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

This is situated immediately to the West of the M32 motorway, towards {{the north of the}} city. The same site is also used by The Breeze for their only transmitter. The transmitter broadcasts on the frequency originally used by the station before it won the regional Severn Estuary licence in 1994 and thus clearance to also transmit on 101.0 from Mendip. Prior to this award, the station served Bristol only, with a coverage area no larger than that of The Breeze.|$|E
40|$|Axion-photon mixing {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} acceleration as the explanation for supernovae dimming. We point out that the loss of photons due to this mixing will induce a strong asymmetry between the luminosity, d_L(z), and angular-diameter distance, d_A(z), since the latter is unaffected by mixing. In a first search for such an asymmetry we introduce a dimensionless mixing amplitude lambda so that lambda= 0 if no photons are lost and lambda = 1 if axion-photon mixing occurs. The best-fit to SNIa and radio galaxy data is lambda = - 0. 3 ^{+ 0. 6 }_{- 0. 4 } (95 % CL), corresponding to an unphysical, negative, mixing length. This same argument limits the attenuation of light from supernovae due to dust. We show that future d_L and d_A data from SNAP and galaxy surveys such as DEEP 2 and KAOS will detect or rule out mixing at more than 5 -sigma, almost independently of the dark energy dynamics. Finally we discuss the constraints from the near maximal polarisation of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 021206. Since <b>mixing</b> reduces the <b>polarisation</b> of distant sources, future observations of high redshift GRBs may provide orthogonal constraints on axion-photon mixing and related scenarios.
