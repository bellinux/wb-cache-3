50|$|Also, it is {{possible}} that <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> is generated from other carotenoids consumed in the diet, as carotenoids are known to convert into different carotenoids for functional reasons. For example, {{it has been suggested that}} <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> of trout integuments is derived from astaxanthin, and <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> in primates (macula lutea) is derived (at least in part) from lutein.|$|E
5000|$|Xu et al. {{concluded}} that <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> has no acute toxicity and no genotoxicity {{and the use}} of <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> is safe at a dose of 300 mg/kg body weight per day in rats from a 90-day feeding study. The authors then applied a 100 fold safety factor, and reported an ADI (acceptable daily intake) of 3 mg/kg body weight per day for <b>meso-zeaxanthin.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2011, the GRAS (‘Generally Regarded As Safe’) {{status of}} <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> was {{acknowledged}} by the FDA in a reply to a proposal from a US {{company on the}} status of <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> (plus L and Z).|$|E
50|$|Carotenoids are {{essential}} for animal life, but animals cannot produce them. Indeed, animals obtain carotenoids from diet, with herbivores sourcing them from plants or algae, and carnivores, in turn, sourcing them from herbivores. There is a general consensus that <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> is not present in plants, but is present in marine species. Originally, {{it was suggested that}} <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> was non-dietary in origin and generated at the macula (the central part of the retina) from retinal lutein (another xanthophyll carotenoid found in the human diet), but this work (limited to animal studies) has since been refuted. Indeed, and consistent with the work by Maoka in 1986, Nolan et al. have shown that <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> is present in the skin of trout, sardine and salmon, and in the flesh of trout. In a subsequent publication, Nolan´s group detected and quantified the three stereoisomers of zeaxanthin, including <b>meso-zeaxanthin,</b> in the flesh of two different trout species. This is the first publication to report the concentrations of <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> in a habitually consumed food. Using data from this publication, it is estimated that when an average sized trout (circa 200 g) is consumed, 0.2 mg of natural <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> is obtained from this source. Moreover, canned sardines can also be considered as a habitual source of <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> for humans, as sardines presented commercially in this way contain a significant amount of skin, which contains meso-zeaxnthin. However, the concentration of <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> in sardine skin has not been determined yet. Previously to this research, a publication from Khachick et al., (2002) reported that liver from Japanese Quail (Coturnix japonica) and frog plasma contain <b>meso-zeaxanthin.</b> Of note, frog legs are consumed habitually in France, as they are considered a delicacy of French cuisine.|$|E
5000|$|In {{another study}} done in Northern Ireland, 19 {{subjects}} consumed a supplement also composed {{of all three}} macular carotenoids, including <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> {{over a period of}} 22 days. Results demonstrated that <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> was absorbed. At the Institute of Vision Research, Waterford Institute of Technology, the <b>Meso-zeaxanthin</b> Ocular Supplementation Trials (MOST), have been conducted to evaluate safety, MP response and serum carotenoid response in subjects with and without AMD, following consumption of a supplement containing all three macular carotenoids in which <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> was predominant. These studies confirmed safety for human consumption of the macular carotenoids [...] following many biological tests to assess renal and liver function, lipid profile, hematologic profile, and markers of inflammation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Meso-zeaxanthin</b> is {{produced}} at an industrial level from the lutein obtained from marigold petals. The process involves saponification set at high temperature and high base concentrations, {{and leads to}} the isomerization of the 4´-5´double bond to the position 5´-6´. This converts the ɛ-ring of lutein into a β-ring, thus converting lutein into <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> (see Figure 3). The stereochemistry of this zeaxanthin {{is determined by the}} position of the hydroxyl group at the position 3´, which results in the [...] "S" [...] in the final zeaxanthin molecule. Therefore, the stereoisomer produced by this process is 3R,3´S-zeaxanthin (i.e. <b>meso-zeaxanthin).</b> The conditions of this saponification can be modulated in order to increase or decrease the conversion rate of lutein into <b>meso-zeaxanthin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Of note, <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> is {{a regular}} dietary {{component}} in countries where {{it is a major}} pigment used by the poultry industry, particularly Mexico, and no adverse effects have been reported. In addition, the safety of <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> has been tested in human clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|Also, the MOST trials {{identified}} {{statistically significant}} increases in serum concentrations of <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> and lutein from baseline. Significant increases in central MP levels were also observed after just two weeks of supplementation. Furthermore, in patients who had an atypical MP distribution in the eye (i.e. {{they did not have}} the high concentration of pigment in the centre of the macula), when supplemented with a <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> dominant supplement for 8 weeks, the more normal pigment profile was re-instated, whereas {{this was not the case}} when supplemented with a formulation lacking <b>meso-zeaxanthin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Meso-zeaxanthin,</b> lutein, and 3R,3´R-zeaxanthin are {{the main}} {{carotenoids}} in the macula lutea, found in a ratio of 1:1:1, and are collectively referred to as macular pigment (MP). <b>Meso-zeaxanthin</b> is concentrated at the epicentre of the macula, where it accounts for around 50% of MP at this location, with lutein dominating the peripheral macula (see Figure 2).|$|E
50|$|The {{first study}} to {{evaluate}} {{the effects of a}} dietary supplement containing predominantly <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> was conducted in a Miami Florida research laboratory by Professors Bone and Landrum. This research confirmed that <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> was effectively absorbed into the serum, and MP density was increased significantly in the supplementation group. No such increases were observed in the placebo group.|$|E
50|$|Specific commercially {{available}} food supplements actively use <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> in their supplement formulations, {{in order to}} increase eye concentrations of these nutrients, and in an attempt to support macular health. These supplements contain 10 mg of <b>meso-zeaxanthin,</b> along with 10 mg of lutein and 2 mg of zeaxanthin. Interestingly, a recent study conducted to test the concordance of carotenoid concentrations of {{commercially available}} food supplements to their label claim found that the measured lutein concentrations (in all the supplements tested) was close to the declared amounts, but that the zeaxanthin concentrations measured varied greatly. In addition, in some of the formulations tested, it was found that <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> was present in the formulation, even though this carotenoid was not declared on the supplement product labels. The authors concluded that the presence of <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> in these formulations was likely due to the process used to extract lutein from the marigold petal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meso-zeaxanthin</b> is {{occasionally}} {{used as a}} dietary supplementation {{by humans}} and in animal productions.|$|E
5000|$|Of {{the three}} macular {{carotenoids}} (lutein, zeaxanthin and <b>meso-zeaxanthin),</b> <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> {{is the most}} powerful antioxidant, but a combination of the macular carotenoids has been shown to exhibit greatest antioxidant potential, when compared to the individual carotenoids at the same total concentration. [...] This may explain why the human macula uniquely contains these three carotenoids from the circa 700 carotenoids present in nature.|$|E
50|$|In summary, the NOAEL {{effect of}} <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> {{is far greater}} than doses used in dietary supplements.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meso-zeaxanthin</b> {{has been}} tested for {{toxicity}} by several different research teams, with all these studies confirming the safety of this compound.|$|E
5000|$|Thurnham et al. {{demonstrated}} (in a rat model) {{that amounts}} of <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> of 2, 20 and 200 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks had no {{adverse effects on}} animal health. In other words, the NOAEL is >200 mg meso-zeaxanthin/kg body weight and this is at least 1400 {{times higher than the}} typical supplement dose. Genotoxicity testing indicated that amounts of <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> from 10 to 5000 µg/plate with or without microsomal enzymes did not increase mutation rates in five bacterial tester strains.|$|E
50|$|Broiler {{chickens}} are yellow {{when they}} are fed with carotenoid-containing feed, as these carotenoids are accumulated in skin and subcutaneous fat of the animal. Carotenoid deposition is also {{the cause of the}} yellow colour of egg yolk. For this reason, poultry producers add carotenoids (typically lutein, zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin and β-apo-8´-apocarotenal) to the feed to increase the attractiveness of the final product for the consumer, but also to support animal health. It is believed that lutein and zeaxanthin act synergistically to increase the yellow hue, whereas zeaxanthin is more powerful than lutein due to its larger chromophore. Therefore, a number of companies use marigold extract where a percentage of lutein has been converted into zeaxanthin (the meso form, <b>meso-zeaxanthin)</b> in order to supplement broilers and hens with both carotenoids. The isomer of zeaxanthin obtained from lutein is <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> {{due to the nature of}} the technique used (see below). Indeed, <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> has been identified in eggs from Mexico and California.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} natural form of zeaxanthin is (3R,3'R)-zeaxanthin. The macula mainly {{contains the}} (3R,3'R)- and <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> forms, {{but it also}} contains much smaller amounts of the third (3S,3'S) form. Evidence exists that a specific zeaxanthin-binding protein recruits circulating zeaxanthin and lutein for uptake within the macula.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{findings}} from the MOST trials in patients with AMD were published in 2013 and 2015. The series of publications from these trials concluded [...] "Augmentation of the MP optical density across its spatial profile and enhancements in contrast sensitivity were best achieved after supplementation with a formulation containing high doses of <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> in combination with lutein and zeaxanthin". Also, the final publication from this work, published in 2015, concluded that [...] "The inclusion of <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> in a supplement formulation seems to confer benefits in terms of MP augmentation {{and in terms of}} enhanced contrast sensitivity in subjects with early AMD. An important and novel finding rests on the observation that sustained supplementation with the macular carotenoids seems necessary to maximally augment MP and to optimize contrast sensitivity over a 3-year period in patients with early AMD".|$|E
50|$|Lutein and {{zeaxanthin}} have identical chemical formulas and are isomers, {{but they}} are not stereoisomers. The only difference between them is in the location of the double bond in one of the end rings. This difference gives lutein three chiral centers whereas zeaxanthin has two. Because of symmetry, the (3R,3'S) and (3S,3'R) stereoisomers of zeaxanthin are identical. Therefore, zeaxanthin has only three stereoisomeric forms. The (3R,3'S) stereoisomer is called <b>meso-zeaxanthin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Carotenoids serve two {{key roles}} in plants and algae: they absorb light energy {{for use in}} photosynthesis, and they protect {{chlorophyll}} from photodamage. Carotenoids that contain unsubstituted beta-ionone rings (including beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin and gamma-carotene) have vitamin A activity (meaning {{that they can be}} converted to retinol), and these and other carotenoids can also act as antioxidants. In the eye, lutein, <b>meso-zeaxanthin,</b> and zeaxanthin are present as macular pigments whose importance in visual function remains under clinical research in 2017.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, however, {{studies have}} shown that the {{addition}} of <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> to formulations used to increase MP and enhance visual function in diseased and non-diseased retinas has proven very effective. Indeed, six head-to-head trials have shown that a formulation containing all three macular carotenoids in a meso-zeaxanthin:lutein:zeaxanthin (mg) ratio of 10:10:2 is superior to alternative formulations, in terms of visual improvements and in terms of observed increases in MP (the precise aim of supplementation). For a detailed description of these studies see below (Human safety studies).|$|E
50|$|In 2013, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) {{reported}} a reduced risk of visual loss and a reduced risk of disease progression {{in patients with}} non-advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD, {{the leading cause of}} blindness in the Western World; Taylor and Keeffe, 2001) who were supplemented with a formulation containing the macular carotenoids and co-antioxidants (The Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) Research Group, 2013, 2014). Unfortunately, the AREDS2 preparation only contained two of macular pigment’s three carotenoids (lutein and 3R,3´R-zeaxanthin), and did not include <b>meso-zeaxanthin,</b> which is the dominant carotenoid at the very centre of the macula, and the presence of which is essential for maximum collective antioxidant effect.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. The three {{carotenoids}} lutein, zeaxanthin, and <b>meso-zeaxanthin,</b> {{are found}} at the macula and referred to as macular pigment (MP).

40|$|Background: Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is a disease}} with multiple risk factors, many of which appear to involve oxidative stress. Macular pigment, with its antioxidant and lightscreening properties, {{is thought to be}} protective against AMD. A result has been the appearance of dietary supplements containing the macular carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin. More recently, a supplement has been marketed containing, in addition, the third major carotenoid of the macular pigment, <b>meso-zeaxanthin.</b> The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine the effectiveness of such a supplement in raising macular pigment density in human subjects. Methods: A 120 day supplementation study was conducted in which 10 subjects were given gelcaps that provided 20 mg/day of predominantly <b>meso-zeaxanthin,</b> with smaller amounts of lutein and zeaxanthin. A second group of 9 subjects were given gel caps containing a placebo for the same 120 day period. Prior to and during the supplementation period, blood serum samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography for carotenoid content. Similarly, macular pigment optical density was measured by heterochromatic flicker photometry. Differences in response between the supplementation and placebo groups were tested for significance using a student 2 ̆ 7 s t-test. Results: During supplementation with the carotenoids, blood samples revealed the presence of all three carotenoids. Macular pigment optical density, measured at 460 nm, rose at an average rate of 0. 59 ± 0. 79 milli-absorbance unit/day in the 10 supplemented subjects. This was significantly different from the placebo group (9 subjects) for whom the average rate was - 0. 17 ± 0. 42 milliabsorbance units/day. Conclusion: We have shown for the first time that <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> is absorbed into the serum following ingestion. The data indicate that a supplement containing predominantly <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> is generally effective at raising macular pigment density, and may turn out to be a useful addition to the defenses against AMD...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} three different macular carotenoid formulations on macular pigment optical density and visual performance in subjects with early age-related macular degeneration. Methods: Fifty-two subjects were supplemented and followed for 12 months, 17 {{of them were in}} intervention Group 1 (20 mg/day lutein and 2 mg/day zeaxanthin); 21 in Group 2 (10 mg/day <b>meso-zeaxanthin,</b> 10 mg/day lutein, and 2 mg/day zeaxanthin); and 14 in Group 3 (17 mg/day <b>meso-zeaxanthin,</b> 3 mg/day lutein, and 2 mg/day zeaxanthin). The macular pigment optical density was measured using customized heterochromatic flicker photometry, and visual function was assessed using corrected distance visual acuity and by letter contrast sensitivity. Results: A statistically significant increase in the macular pigment optical density was observed at all measured eccentricities in Group 2 (P # 0. 005) and in Group 3 (P, 0. 05, for all), but only at 1. 75 ° in Group 1 (P = 0. 018). Statistically significant (P, 0. 05) improvements in letter contrast sensitivity were seen at all spatial frequencies (except 1. 2 cycles per degree) in Group 3, and at low spatial frequencies in Groups 1 and 2. Conclusion: Augmentation of the macular pigment optical density across its spatial profile and enhancements in contrast sensitivity were best achieved after supplementation with a formulation containing high doses of <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> in combination with lutein and zeaxanthin...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of lutein, zeaxanthin and <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> on macular pigment optical density (MPOD) in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) among patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and healthy subjects. Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases was searched through May 2016. Meta-analysis was conducted to obtain adjusted weighted mean differences (WMD) for intervention-versus-placebo group about the change of MPOD between baseline and terminal point. Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between the changes in MPOD and blood xanthophyll carotenoids or baseline MPOD levels. Twenty RCTs involving 938 AMD patients and 826 healthy subjects were identified. Xanthophyll carotenoids supplementation was associated with significant increase in MPOD in AMD patients (WMD, 0. 07; 95 % CI, 0. 03 to 0. 11) and healthy subjects (WMD, 0. 09; 95 % CI, 0. 05 to 0. 14). Stratified analysis showed a greater increase in MPOD among trials supplemented and combined with <b>meso-zeaxanthin.</b> Additionally, the changes in MPOD were related with baseline MPOD levels (rAMD = − 0. 43, p = 0. 06; rhealthy subjects = − 0. 71, p < 0. 001) and blood xanthophyll carotenoids concentration (rAMD = 0. 40, p = 0. 07; rhealthy subjects = 0. 33, p = 0. 05). This meta-analysis revealed that lutein, zeaxanthin and <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> supplementation improved MPOD both in AMD patients and healthy subjects with a dose-response relationship...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Macular Pigment (MP) is {{composed}} of two dietary carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, and a carotenoid generated by the retina, <b>meso-zeaxanthin.</b> There is large intersubject variability in peak optical density, spatial profile, and lateral extent of macular pigment, {{and it has been}} suggested that foveal architecture may play a role in in this variability. This study is an initial investigation of the relationship between the spatial profile of macular pigment and foveal architecture...|$|E
40|$|Three dietary carotenoids, lutein (L), {{zeaxanthin}} (Z) and <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> (MZ) accumulate at {{the central}} retina (macula), where they are collectively referred to as macular pigment (MP). MP’s pre-receptoral absorption of blue light and consequential attenuation {{of the effects of}} chromatic aberration and light scatter are important for optimal visual function. Furthermore, antioxidant activity of MP’s constituent carotenoids and the same blue light-filtering properties underlie the rationale for its putative protective role for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Supplementation with L, Z and MZ augments MP and enhances visual performance in diseased and non-diseased eyes, and may reduce risk of AMD development and/or progression...|$|E
40|$|The macula of {{the human}} retina {{contains}} high amounts of the xanthophyll carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin [a mixture of (3 R, 3 ′R) -zeaxanthin and (3 R, 3 ′S-meso) -zeaxanthin]. Recently, it was shown that the uptake and the stabilization of zeaxanthin and lutein into the retina {{are likely to be}} mediated by specific xanthophyll-binding proteins (XBP). Here, we have used femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy to study the dynamics of the S 1 state of these xanthophylls in xanthophyll-enriched and native XBP. The results from the native XBP and the enriched XBP were then compared with those for carotenoids in organic solvents and in detergent micelles. Steady-state and transient absorption spectra show that the incorporation of xanthophylls into the protein causes a redshift of the spectra, which is stronger for lutein than for zeaxanthin. The transient absorption spectra further indicate that a part of the xanthophylls remains unbound in the xanthophyll-enriched XBP. The transient absorption spectra of the native XBP prove the presence of both xanthophylls in native XBP. Although the S 1 lifetime of lutein does not exhibit any changes when measured in solution, micelles or XBP, we have observed the influence of the environment on the S 1 lifetime of <b>meso-zeaxanthin,</b> which has a longer (12 ps) lifetime in XBP than in solution (9 ps). The most pronounced effect was found for vibrational relaxation in the S 1 state, which is significantly slower for xanthophylls in XBP compared with micelles and solution. This effect is more pronounced for <b>meso-zeaxanthin,</b> suggesting a specific site of binding of this carotenoid to XBP...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a deeper {{understanding}} of the nature of carotenoid metabolism in the human and primate retina. We have sought to do this from two perspectives (1) through preparation and study of a carotenoid diketone that is a candidate metabolic product and (2) through measurement of the carotenoid distribution in the retinas of neonatal macaques. In this thesis we report the synthesis, purification, and characterization of the product using HPLC, UV/Vis, MS, 1 H-NMR. The data obtained are all consistent with the proposed β,β-carotene- 3, 32 ̆ 7 -dione. There has been no thorough study of the development of the macular pigment during the earliest stages of life immediately following birth. In this study 30 macaque retinas ranging from 148 days of gestation to 15 years in age were analyzed.

40|$|AbstractSpeed of {{processing}} {{is a particularly}} important characteristic of the visual system. Often a behavioral reaction to a visual stimulus must be faster than the conscious perception of that stimulus, {{as is the case}} with many sports (e. g., baseball). Visual psychophysics provides a relatively simple and precise means of measuring visual processing speed called the temporal contrast sensitivity function (tCSF). Past study has shown that macular pigment (a collection of xanthophylls, lutein (L), <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> (MZ) and zeaxanthin (Z), found in the retina) optical density (MPOD) is positively correlated with the tCSF. In this study, we found similar correlations when testing 102 young healthy subjects. As a follow-up, we randomized 69 subjects to receive a placebo (n= 15) or one of two L and Z supplements (n= 54). MPOD and tCSF were measured psychophysically at baseline and 4 months. Neither MPOD nor tCSF changed for the placebo condition, but both improved significantly as a result of supplementation. These results show that an intervention with L and Z can increase processing speed even in young healthy subjects...|$|E
40|$|Lutein, zeaxanthin, and <b>meso-zeaxanthin</b> are {{xanthophyll}} carotenoids {{found within}} the retina and throughout the visual system. The retina {{is one of the}} most metabolically active tissues in the body. The highest concentration of xanthophylls is {{found within the}} retina, and this selective presence has generated many theories regarding their role in supporting retinal function. Subsequently, the effect of xanthophylls in the prevention and treatment of various eye diseases has been examined through epidemiological studies, animal studies, and clinical trials. This paper attempts to review the epidemiological studies and clinical trials investigating the effects of xanthophylls on the incidence and progression of various eye diseases. Observational studies have reported that increased dietary intake and higher serum levels of lutein and zeaxanthin are associated with lower risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), especially late AMD. Randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that xanthophyll supplementation increases macular pigment levels, improves visual function, and decreases the risk of progression to late AMD, especially neovascular AMD. Current publications on the preventive and therapeutic effects of lutein and zeaxanthin on cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and retinopathy of prematurity have reported encouraging results...|$|E
