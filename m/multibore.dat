40|$|Advanced disk {{structural}} {{concepts are}} used to improve the cyclic lives and reliability of turbine disks. Analytical studies were conducted to evaluate bore-entry disks as potential replacements for the existing first-stage turbine disks in the CF 6 - 50 and JT 8 D- 17 engines. Results of low-cycle fatigue, burst, fracture mechanics, and fragment energy analyses are summarized for the advanced disk designs and the existing disk designs with both conventional and advanced disk materials. Other disk concepts such as composite, laminated, link, <b>multibore,</b> multidisk, and spline disks were also evaluated for the CF 6 - 50 engine...|$|E
40|$|The rapidly {{developing}} {{field of}} tissue engineering produces living substitutes that restore, maintain or improve {{the function of}} tissues or organs. In contrast to standard therapies, the engineered products become integrated within the patient, affording a potentially permanent and specific cure of the disease, injury or impairment. Despite the great progress in the field, development of clinically relevantly sized tissues with complex architecture remains a great challenge. This is mostly due to limitations of nutrient and oxygen delivery to the cells and limited availability of scaffolds that can mimic the complex tissue architecture. This study presents {{the development of a}} multilayer tissue construct by rolling pre-seeded electrospun sheets [(prepared from poly (l-lactic acid) (PLLA) seeded with C 2 C 12 pre-myoblast cells) ] around a porous <b>multibore</b> hollow fibre (HF) membrane and its testing using a bioreactor. Important elements of this study are: 1) the medium permeating through the porous walls of <b>multibore</b> HF acts as an additional source of nutrients and oxygen to the cells, which exerts low shear stress (controllable by trans membrane pressure); 2) application of dynamic perfusion through the HF lumen and around the 3 D construct to achieve high cell proliferation and homogenous cell distribution across the layers, and 3) cell migration occurs within the multilayer construct (shown using pre-labeled C 2 C 12 cells), illustrating the potential of using this concept for developing thick and more complex tissues.

40|$|This work {{describes}} a route towards an immune protective device for islet of Langerhans transplantation. We developed a protocol to use MIN 6 β cells aggregates as pseudo-islets {{to overcome the}} donor shortage issue (chapter 3). In this thesis we explored two different immune protective strategies; a <b>multibore</b> hollow fiber and flat microwell membranes. In chapter 4 we investigated the possibility to use a commercial <b>multibore</b> hollow fiber. In this chapter we showed that we were capable to physically separate islets using agarose macrospheres. Photoacoustic imaging in chapter 5 confirmed these findings. The flat membrane microwell device was developed based on work of Buitinga et al. (1) who developed a poly(ethylene glycol terephthalate) -poly(butylene terephthalate) (PEOT/PBT) microwell scaffold, made by micro thermoforming of dense thin films. We developed a microwell device that consisted of a thin PES/PVP membrane for islet encapsulation and a 0. 45 μm pore sized PES lid (chapter 6). These membranes were sealed prior to seeding by a custom made seal device. Encapsulated human islets were still responsive to glucose stimulation after 7 days of culture. As a lack of proper vascularization after transplantation and thereby hypoxia is {{a major contributor to}} islet death, we studied solutions to overcome this issue. In chapter 7 we showed that micropatterned membranes in combination with MSCs could be used to enhance vascularization in vivo. Finally, we combined the oxygen generating materials of Pedraza et al. (2) with the microwell membrane device of chapter 6 in chapter 8. We showed, similar to Pedraza et al. that the oxygen generating disk had a positive effect on islet viability and function. In this thesis we took the first steps towards an immune protective device, although successful in many aspects additional work is needed to further optimize the devices developed in this work. Therefore in chapter 9 an outlook is presented of different options in order to reach a functional immune protective device for islet encapsulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} {{this thesis is about}} the development of novel membrane based macroencapsulation devices for improved pancreatic islet survival and function. To improve pancreatic islets functionality by avoiding their aggregation within macroencapsulation devices, we developed a novel microwell membrane based encapsulation device, where the islets are seeded in separate microwells avoiding their fusion and clustering. The membrane porosity is tailored to achieve shielding of the islets from the host immune cells without compromising their secretory responses. The non-degradable, microwell membranes are composed of poly (ether sulfone) /polyvinylpyrrolidone (PES/PVP) and manufactured via phase separation micromolding. The encapsulated islets maintain their glucose responsiveness demonstrating the potential of this novel device for islet transplantation. Moreover, we fabricated porous, micropatterned PES/PVP membranes and investigated the effect of patterns on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) alignment and interconnection as a first step towards the development of a stable prevascularized layer in vitro. The micropatterned surface, applied as lid for the microwell macroencapsulation device, would support cell organization during the development of a prevascularized layer {{on the outside of the}} device. Providing encapsulated islets with close proximity to blood vessels is important for their survival and function. Additionally, in order to mimic the β-cell relation with endothelial cells in native islets, we created stable composite aggregates by co-culture of mouse insulinoma MIN 6 cells with HUVECs on a non-adherent agarose microwell platform. These composite aggregates maintain their function after encapsulation within our microwell PES/PVP device and show better insulin release than encapsulated pure MIN 6 aggregates, indicating that providing the β-cells with a connection to the endothelial cells within an encapsulation device can improve the encapsulated cells’ functionality. As alternative for the flat configuration, we developed new PES/PVP <b>multibore</b> hollow fiber membranes for islet macroencapsulation. The fiber consists of seven bores and has high mechanical stability offering good protection to the encapsulated islets. Human islets encapsulated within the fiber bores retain their glucose responsiveness. Our new <b>multibore</b> hollow fiber membranes have higher islet encapsulation capacity than single-bore fibers and allow for easier up-scaling, which are important factors for the development of a clinically applicable bioartificial pancreas...|$|E
40|$|The noninvasive and {{longitudinal}} imaging {{of cells}} or cell aggregates in large optically scattering scaffolds {{is still a}} largely unresolved problem in tissue engineering. In this work, we investigated the potential of near-infrared (NIR) photoacoustic (PA) tomography imaging to address this issue. We used clinically relevant sizes of highly light scattering polyethersulfone <b>multibore</b> hollow fiber scaffolds seeded with cells. Since cells have little optical absorption at NIR wavelengths, we studied labeling of cells with absorbers. Four NIR labels were examined for their suitability based on absorption characteristics, resistance to bleaching, and influence on cell viability. On {{the basis of these}} criteria, carbon nanoparticles proved most suitable in a variety of cells. For PA imaging, we used a research setup, based on computed tomography geometry. As proof of principle, using this imager we monitored the distribution and clustering of labeled rat insulinoma beta cell aggregates in the scaffolds. This was performed for the duration of 1 week in a nondestructive manner. The results were validated using fluorescence imaging, histology, and light microscopy imaging. Based on our findings, we conclude that PA tomography is a powerful tool for the nondestructive imaging of cells in optically scattering tissue-engineered scaffolds...|$|E
40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} aims at restoring or regenerating {{a damaged}} tissue. Often the tissue recreation occurs by combining cells, {{derived from a}} patient biopsy, onto a 3 D porous matrix, functioning as a scaffold. One of the current limitations of tissue engineering is the inability to provide sufficient nutrient and oxygen supply in developing 3 D in-vitro culture. In human body the vasculature is embedded into almost every tissues and organs. They transport blood, and thus nutrients and waste products, to and from almost {{any part of the}} body. It is a critical template for the exchange of gas, nutrients, cells or molecules and a regulator of tissue development. Insufficient vascularization within the construct results in nutrient limitations, which in-turn results in suboptimal integration of, and cell death in tissue engineered constructs. This thesis explores a new approach by integrating semi-permeable porous hollow fiber membrane in to tissue engineered scaffolds to mimic capillary network. The rationale of this method is that the hollow fibers integrated within the tissue engineered scaffolds would supply required nutrients and gases through the walls of the fiber during in-vitro perfusion bioreactor culture. Furthermore, the same approach is used to develop 3 D multilayer tissue using bottom-up process by rolling pre-seeded electrospun (ES) sheets around <b>multibore</b> hollow fiber. The rolling of pre-seeded ES sheet to form multilayer constructs achieves uniform cell distribution in the scaffold and has a marked potential to form functional tissue composed of multiple cell types. This thesis also presents the development of biodegradable hollow fiber membrane of poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA), suitable for nutrient perfusion and illustrates the effect of scaffold surface structure and curvature which plays a critical role in cell adhesion and proliferation in dynamic culture conditions...|$|E
40|$|Currently, cancer {{accounts}} for nearly 1 of every 4 {{deaths in the}} United States which rates it as {{the second most common}} cause of death in the US, exceeded only by heart diseases. The detection, prevention and treatment of these death-causing diseases have necessitated and {{led to the development of}} novel tools for interfacing with single live cells –intracellular cell physiology. A major challenge, preventing the realization of effective and efficient intracellular physiology, is the lack of minimally invasive, nanoscale electrodes capable of probing cells without causing cell damage or death. Previous studies have succeeded in fabricating single nanoscale electrodes suitable for cell probing, but in this research, we introduce the controllable fabrication of <b>Multibore</b> Carbon Nanopipettes (MCNPs) –nanoscale probes with multiple, independent hollow carbon nanoscale electrodes within one very small tip – in three stages: (i) forming templates by pulling micropipettes from theta glass capillaries (pipette pulling); (ii) selectively depositing carbon via CVD on the lumen walls of the micropipette (carbon deposition); and (iii) exposing the two carbon nanostructures formed at the micropipette tip with selective wet-etching (carbon exposure). These MCNPs, suitable for cell probing, also incorporate a multifunctionality that is yet to be seen in existing microelectrodes. Here, we present the step-by-step, repeatable methodology in fabricating MCNPs, the governing parameters at different stages of fabrication and the effects of varying these parameters. We establish that the MCNP geometry can be defined at the pulling stage, where the taper length and diameter of the pipette have an inverse relationship; carbon thickness is defined at the carbon deposition stage and the carbon exposure stage defines the exposed carbon length. We also showed the capability of our MCNPs for intracellular injection by demonstrating their effectiveness in fluid transport and delivery. The fabrication technique offers a repeatable and low cost process of manufacturing MCNPs, thereby making it a commercially viable nanomanufacturing technique that will enable numerous intracellular applications beyond cell probing. Finally, the continuous development of the MCNPs for these numerous intracellular applications may bring about a reform in single cell analysis, biomedical research and disease pathology research...|$|E
