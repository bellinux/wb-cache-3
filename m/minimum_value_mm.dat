40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} radio wave delay of the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal can be manipulated to estimate the precipitable water vapor (PWV) which favorable for meteorological applications. A rapid change of the water vapor amount was a precondition for the unbalanced atmospheric charges, which noticeably associated {{with the development of}} convective cloud as a lightning chamber. According to this fact, GPS derived PWV will be utilized to nowcasting the lightning event {{for the next couple of}} hours. The variances of PWV of four-selected station of the Peninsular Malaysia during the past two inter-monsoons events in May and November 2009 were analyzed. To clarify the response, the changes of PWV in hourly Δ (max-min) before the lightning event was investigated with <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> 2 <b>mm</b> and is maintained at least three consecutive hours. There are 177 samples were extracted from this method and 69 % of the sample showed the lightning occurrence with an average duration was after the six consecutive hours. The lightning day with 2 mm Δ was also higher than the fair weather of 6. 3 %. These findings suggest that the GPS data can be proposed further as a guide to nowcast the occurrence of lightning activity. </p...|$|R
40|$|Trough {{computed}} tomography (CT), {{it is possible}} to evaluate lymph nodes in detail and to detect changes in these structures earlier than with radiographs and ultrasound. Lack of information in the veterinary literature directed the focus of this report to normal aspects of the axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes of adult dogs on CT imaging. A CT scan of 15 normal adult male and female Rottweilers was done. To define them as clinically sound, anamnesis, physical examination, complete blood count, renal and hepatic biochemistry, ECG, and thoracic radiographs were performed. After the intravenous injection of hydrosoluble ionic iodine contrast medium contiguous 10 mm in thickness thoracic transverse images were obtained with an axial scanner. In the obtained images mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes were sought and when found measured in their smallest diameter and their attenuation was compared to musculature. Mean and standard deviation of: age, weight, body length and the smallest diameter of the axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes were determined. Mean and standard deviation of parameters: age 3. 87 ± 2. 03 years, weight 41. 13 ± 5. 12, and body length 89. 61 ± 2. 63 cm. Axillary lymph nodes were seen in 60 % of the animals, mean of the smallest diameter was 3. 58 mm {{with a standard deviation of}} 2. 02 and a <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> of 1 <b>mm</b> and a maximum <b>value</b> of 7 <b>mm.</b> From 13 observed lymph nodes 61. 53 % were hypopodense when compared with musculature, and 30. 77 % were isodense. Mediastinal lymph nodes were identified in 73. 33 % of the dogs; mean measure of the smallest diameter was 4. 71 mm with a standard deviation of 2. 61 <b>mm</b> and a <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> of 1 <b>mm,</b> and a maximum <b>value</b> of 8 <b>mm.</b> From 14 observed lymph nodes 85. 71 % were isodense when compared with musculature and 14. 28 % were hypodense. The results show that {{it is possible to}} visualize axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes in adult clinically sound Rottweilers with CT using a slice thickness and interval of 10 mm. The smallest diameter of the axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes not surpassed 7 mm and 8 mm respectively. Their attenuations were equal or smaller than that of musculature in the post contrast scan...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical analysis for location estimation of a wireless capsule endoscope (WCE) in the small-intestine region. Under three different shadowing scenarios by assuming {{standard deviation of}} the shadowing with the constant variance, parameter-dependent variance, or correlated and parameter-dependent variance, analytical formulas are derived for the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for capsule positioning when distance and azimuth angle measurements are employed to estimate {{the location of the}} capsule. The CRLB analysis can be employed to quantify the best achievable location estimation performance. We also present some numerical results to show the CRLB for three scenarios. The results show that in the most realistic scenario, when the shadowing is spatially correlated and distance dependent and the standard deviation of noise is 7 dB, the maximum square root of CRLB is 3. 8 mm. Moreover, the square root of CRLB experiences its <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> of 2 <b>mm,</b> when the capsule is away from its first location about half of the capsule length. Overall, the result of this paper suggests {{that it is possible to}} use received signal strength such as measured by a radar system for location estimation of a WCE. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze cone beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) densitometries of maxillary sinuses augmented with human bone allograft. In addition, previously obtained microradiographic specimens were used to verify the diagnostic potential of CBCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A two-stage protocol was conducted in 21 consecutive patients, all with a crestal bone height < 2 mm. Mineralized human bone allograft particles were used to augment sinuses using a lateral window approach. A succession of CBCT scans of the maxilla were taken before surgery, immediately after sinus augmentation, and 6, 10, and 18 months after implant placement. Using virtual probes, CBCT images taken at 6, 8, and 10 mm from the crestal surface were processed with medical imaging software and expressed as gray level (GL). RESULTS: A total of 24 sinus augmentation procedures were performed in 21 patients. The average values of CBCT-GL ranged from 571 to 654, presenting the maximum <b>value</b> at 8 <b>mm</b> immediately after implant placement and the <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> at 6 <b>mm</b> after 10 months. Furthermore, it was found that the graft mineral content decreased over time, completely disappearing between 10 and 11 months. CONCLUSION: CBCT and the medical imaging software employed for imaging visualization are reliable tools to study biomaterial behavior after sinus augmentation procedures. In addition, results from this study demonstrate that a complete resorption of human bone allograft is possible. Due to the limited sample size, further clinical and morphometric studies are needed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{the thickness of}} dental tissue through which Prime Dent Resin® might exhibit light-polymerization with minimum shrinkage and suitable curing depth. Method 80 laminae measuring 1, 2, 3 and 4 mm thickness were obtained from molars (20 laminae per group). Contraction was measured and resin shrinkage was calculated by polymerization (Visilux 2, 3 M) though each lamina (60 s, 400 mW/cm 2). Bonded-disk technique was used. Depth of curing tests were undertaken by measuring the thickness of polymerized resin according to ADA's specification number 27. A control group without dental tissue was prepared for both properties. Data were analyzed using ANOVA with Tukey test (p < 0. 001). ResultsCuring depth: curing depth decreased as thickness increased. All groups revealed statistically significant differences. The thickness that exhibited lesser shrinkage nonetheless meeting with suitable curing depth (ADA establishes <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> of 1 <b>mm)</b> was the 3 mm group. Shrinkage: as thickness increased, shrinkage decreased; {{no statistically significant difference}} was reported for groups 2 and 3 mm. ConclusionsAccording to obtained results, it is possible to polymerize through a 3 mm thickness, therefore polymerization is not recommended through a 4 mm depth. It will be necessary to obtain further mechanical properties using different thicknesses of dental tissue...|$|R
40|$|The free ion {{concentrations}} of Na+, K+ and Cl- have been {{measured in the}} cells and intercellular spaces of developing amphibian embryos using ion-sensitive microelectrodes. Ca 2 +, H+ and buffering capacity have also been measured in the intercellular spaces. The free intracellular Na+ and K+ concentrations in the early cleavage stages remain approximately constant at 21 mM and 90 mM respectively. The free intracellular Cl- concentration, approximately 60 mM during the egg to 4 -cell stage, falls during development to around 30 mM by the 128 -cell stage. Embryos from different batches show a wide variation in intracellular free ion content. A strong correlation was observed between the ion content, particularly of K+, and {{the viability of the}} embryo. If the intracellular K+ concentration was less than 60 mM, embryos invariably died between late blastula and early gastrula stages; if greater than 80 mM the embryo generally survived. The intercellular free Na+, K+, Cl- and Ca 2 + concentrations in Xenopus mid-blastula embryos are 91 mM, 4 mM, 59 mM and 1. 5 mM respectively. The intercellular potential at late neurula stages is + 3. 5 mV when the embryo is bathed in 5 % Ringer solution; changing to Ringer solution reduced the potential to - 4 mV. Before gastrulation the intercellular Ca 2 + concentration in Xenopus falls to approximately 0. 5 mM, where it remains throughout gastrulation before returning to its mid-blastula value during neurulation. In Xenopus, the intercellular Na+ concentration falls to around 75 mM and the intercellular K+ concentration rises to around 17 mM at the end of gastrulation. These changes are not maintained and both Na+ and K+ concentrations return to their earlier values. In Ambystoma, the intercellular K+ concentration falls steadily from 7 mM at the mid-blastula stage to 2 mM at the end of neurulation. The Na+ concentration is constant at approximately 93 mM up to stage 14; between stages 14 and 16 the measurements show some scatter (<b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> 60 <b>mM,</b> maximum <b>value</b> 100 <b>mM),</b> and beyond stage 16 the Na+ concentration increases to 123 mM...|$|R
