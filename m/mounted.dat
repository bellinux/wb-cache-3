Chauvel arrived at the Asluj Desert <b>Mounted</b> Corps headquarters during the afternoon of 30 October, when arrangements were completed for the continuation of the marches by the Anzac and Australian <b>Mounted</b> Divisions. The Anzac <b>Mounted</b> Division was at Asluj, the Australian <b>Mounted</b> Division was at Khalasa (three hours' march behind) and the 7th <b>Mounted</b> Brigade was at Bir el Esani. The No. 11 Light Armoured Motor Battery (LAMB) was sent ahead of the Anzac <b>Mounted</b> Division to a position on the north slopes of the Gebel el Shereif to guard their flank as they moved forward. The divisional headquarters at Asluj closed at 17:30, and the last Anzac divisional troops left the railway station a half-hour later.|$|E

5|$|During the Gallipoli Campaign four {{light horse}} brigades had been {{dismounted}} and fought alongside the infantry divisions. However, in March 1916 the ANZAC <b>Mounted</b> Division {{was formed in}} Egypt (so named because it contained one <b>mounted</b> brigade from New Zealand – the New Zealand <b>Mounted</b> Rifles Brigade). Likewise, the Australian <b>Mounted</b> Division—formed in February 1917—was originally named the Imperial <b>Mounted</b> Division because it contained the British 5th and 6th <b>Mounted</b> Brigades. Each division consisted of three <b>mounted</b> light horse brigades. A light horse brigade consisted of three regiments. Each regiment included three squadrons of four troops and a machine-gun section. The initial strength of a regiment was around 500 men, although its establishment changed throughout the war. In 1916, the machine-gun sections of each regiment were concentrated as squadrons at brigade-level. Like the infantry, the light horse regiments were raised on a territorial basis by state and were identified numerically (1st to 15th).|$|E

The AIF also included the Australian Flying Corps (AFC), which consisted of four operational squadrons—Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4, and four training squadrons—Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8. More than 2,000 women served with the AIF, mainly in the Australian Army Nursing Service.
