5|$|I was {{thinking}} about how Portland is designed and planned and built, and how the planning and infrastructure of Portland is really important in what makes Portland great. I {{was thinking}} of the static tripod as the infrastructure. The <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> was the vibrancy and life.... The most interesting part of the sculpture will be watching people try to move it.|$|E
25|$|In an {{upstream}} valve, the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> {{works against}} {{the pressure and}} opens {{in the opposite direction}} to the flow of gas. They are often made as tilt-valves, which are mechanically extremely simple and reliable, but are not amenable to fine tuning.|$|E
25|$|In an {{electric}} motor, the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> is the rotor, which turns the shaft {{to deliver the}} mechanical power. The rotor usually has conductors laid into it that carry currents, which interact with the magnetic field of the stator to generate the forces that turn the shaft. However, some rotors carry permanent magnets, and the stator holds the conductors.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional {{aircraft}} inlets contain many heavy <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b> In comparison, DSI completely eliminates all <b>moving</b> <b>parts,</b> {{which makes}} it far less complex and more reliable than earlier diverter-plate inlets. The removal of <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> also reduces the overall weight of the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The design {{features}} no <b>moving</b> <b>parts,</b> which the creators claim increases reliability compared to conventional engines with <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Movement: Machines or {{instruments}} with <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> {{may affect}} isolation systems. It {{is important to}} know the mass, speed, and distance traveled of the <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|R
25|$|Bodies {{are divided}} into two groups; for some are living and others are devoid of life. In {{the case of the}} living things, in order that there be in the same subject an {{essentially}} <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> and an essentially moved part, the substantial form, which is designated by the name soul, requires an organic disposition, i.e. heterogeneous parts.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{version of the}} Pickett-Hamilton fort {{consists}} of two cylinders of pre-cast concrete each with one end closed. The slightly smaller of the two cylinders slides into the larger and they are kept apart by small guard rollers on the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> that engaged with grooves. The structure is buried so that the overhanging top of the smaller cylinder lies flush with the ground. Closed in this position the pillbox is inconspicuous and allows aircraft and other vehicles to safely drive straight over it.|$|E
25|$|The Four Great Inventions was {{featured}} {{as one of}} the main themes of the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics. Paper making was represented with a dance and an ink drawing on a huge piece of paper, printing by a set of dancing printing blocks, a replica of an ancient compass was showcased, and gunpowder by the extensive firework displays during the ceremony. A survey by the Beijing Social Facts & Public Opinion Survey Center found that Beijing residents found the program on the Four Great Inventions the most <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> of the opening ceremony.|$|E
50|$|Two {{means are}} used for {{overcoming}} the efficiency losses caused by friction between <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b> First, <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> are lubricated. Second, the <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> of a machine are designed so {{that they have a}} small amount of contact with one another. The latter, in its turn, comprises two approaches. A machine can be reduced in size, thereby quite simply reducing the areas of the <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> that rub against one another; and the designs of the individual components can be modified, changing their shapes and structures to reduce or avoid contact with one another.|$|R
50|$|The <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> of {{a machine}} are those parts of it that move. Machines include both moving (or movable) and fixed <b>parts.</b> The <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> have {{controlled}} and constrained motions.|$|R
30|$|A further {{positive}} characteristic is {{that the}} cluster do not contain <b>moving</b> <b>parts,</b> such as fans or hard disk drives. The lack of <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> makes the cluster less error prone.|$|R
25|$|U2 were criticised in 2007 for <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> {{of their}} multimillion-euro song {{catalogue}} from Ireland to Amsterdam {{six months before}} Ireland ended a tax exemption on musicians' royalties. Under Dutch tax law, bands are subject to low to non-existent tax rates. U2's manager, Paul McGuinness, stated that the arrangement is legal and customary and businesses often seek to minimise their tax burdens. The move prompted criticisms in the Irish parliament. The band later responded by stating that approximately 95% of their business took place outside Ireland, {{and that they were}} taxed globally because of this. Bono was one of several wealthy figures whose tax arrangements were singled out for criticism in a report by the charity Christian Aid in 2008.|$|E
25|$|In October, the 2/8th was transported on the troopship Aconagua to Torokina, {{which was}} the main Australian base on Bougainville, where it joined the rest of II Corps, who were concentrating {{in the area for}} the {{upcoming}} Bougainville campaign. As the campaign progressed the squadron conducted patrols from Torokina to Kuraio Mission and Amun in the northern sector on a weekly basis throughout November and into December, before handing over responsibility of the area to the 11th Brigade and being transferred to the southern sector. This was where the main battle for Bougainville was being fought, and as the 3rd Division advanced along the coast towards the Japanese base at Buin, the 2/8th was tasked to provide flank protection for the division. As a part of this, they conducted a number of reconnaissance patrols, often <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> of the way by barge, as well as conducting ambushes {{in order to keep the}} enemy off balance.|$|E
500|$|The {{boiler house}} and Number 2 Engine {{were in a}} {{particularly}} bad condition: the roof was wrecked, the metal fixtures were corroded, moss was growing on exposed surfaces and the boilers were not operational. [...] Number 2 Engine had not been steamed since 1954, {{and had to be}} taken apart and rebuilt while the building was restored around it. [...] Every <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> was cleaned by hand, and the exterior was repainted in its correct colour after the original paintwork was discovered under layers of mould and rust. [...] The eight men worked for about six months on these tasks; Number 2 Engine was successfully fired up again on 14 March 1976 after the two renovated Lancashire boilers were tested and inspected by safety officials (the other two were left in their unrestored state).|$|E
5000|$|The {{amount of}} <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> in a machine {{is a factor}} in its {{mechanical}} efficiency. The greater the number of <b>moving</b> <b>parts,</b> the greater the amount of energy lost to heat by friction between those parts. [...] In a modern automobile engine, for example, roughly 7% of the total power obtained from burning the engine's fuel is lost to friction between the engine's <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In recent decades, {{the use of}} {{animation}} has become more practical and widespread in technical and engineering diagrams for the illustration of the motions of <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b> Animation represents <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> more clearly and enables them and their motions to be more readily visualized. [...] Furthermore, computer aided design tools allow the motions of <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> to be simulated, allowing machine designers to determine, for example, whether the <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> in a given design would obstruct one another's motion or collide by simple visual inspection of the (animated) computer model {{rather than by the}} designer performing a numerical analysis directly.|$|R
50|$|Passive orthoses do {{not require}} {{external}} power and {{are less likely to}} have <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b> However, many passive orthoses have been developed to aid movement through use of springs and other such <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|R
500|$|In 2003, Andrew Gans {{wrote in}} Playbill.com of Peters' {{recording}} sessions for Gypsy: [...] "What {{is it about}} her voice that is so <b>moving?</b> <b>Part</b> womanly and part girlish, it is a powerful instrument, not only in volume (though that is impressive) but in the wealth of emotion {{it is able to}} convey. ... her voice – that mix of husky, sweet, rounded, vibrato-filled tones – induces a response that spans the emotional scale." [...] Of her [...] "Rose's Turn", Gans wrote: [...] "...her rendition of this song may be the highlight of a career already filled with many highlights: She has taken a song that has been delivered incredibly by others and brought it to a new level." [...] Of her performance on the recording of Follies (2011), Steven Suskin wrote in Playbill.com: [...] "This is a fine Sally, the sort of Sally you'd expect to get from an actress like – well, Bernadette Peters. The performance on the CD is compelling; either this is simply the magic of the recording studio or Peters has changed what she does and how she does it." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott Matthewman, {{writing for}} The Stage, gave a mixed {{review of the}} episode. He thought that [...] "pretty much the only {{surprise}} {{in the way the}} humans who made up the Ood Corporation were presented came as PR girl Solana (Ayesha Dharker) escaped with the Doctor and Donna, only to betray their position by calling for the guards," [...] and [...] "the revelation that Ryder (Adrian Rawlins) has been working to infiltrate the Corporation is thrown away... as quickly as it is revealed." [...] However, he thought Donna was becoming [...] "fast... one of the strongest and most well-rounded companions in the series’ history", and [...] "there were some nice interpretations of the Ood’s natural development". Caitlin Moran of The Times thought the episode was [...] "really really good... – one that will have you staring at your screen and asking, once again, 'How can something so good be happening so early on a Saturday night, in my own front room?'". She enjoyed the scene where the Doctor and Donna talk about slaves in contemporary culture, saying that Tate [...] "really, really isn’t that bad when she says [...] ". Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode five stars out of five. Rawson-Jones opened his review by saying [...] "Doctor Who can occasionally transcend the properties of a mere family television show to reach out and give viewers a poignant, beautiful epiphany and greater sense of the world they inhabit," [...] citing Donna's reaction on seeing the uncultivated Ood as the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> of the episode.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{mention of}} {{tropical}} pitcher plants {{was made in}} 1790, when Portuguese priest João de Loureiro described Phyllamphoramirabilis, or the [...] "marvellous urn-shaped leaf", from Vietnam. Despite living {{in the country for}} around 35 years, it seems unlikely that Loureiro observed living plants of this species, as he stated the lid is a <b>moving</b> <b>part,</b> actively opening and closing. In his most celebrated work, Flora Cochinchinensis, he writes: ...|$|E
50|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{have fewer}} <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> than reciprocating compressors which, theoretically, should improve reliability. According to Emerson Climate Technologies, manufacturer of Copeland scroll compressors, scroll compressors have 70 percent fewer <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> than conventional reciprocating compressors.|$|R
5000|$|Conversely, {{the fewer}} {{the number of}} <b>moving</b> <b>parts,</b> the greater the efficiency. Machines with no <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> at all can be very efficient. An {{electrical}} transformer, for example, has no <b>moving</b> <b>parts,</b> and its mechanical efficiency is generally above the 90% mark. (The remaining power losses in a transformer are from other causes, including loss to electrical resistance in the copper windings and hysteresis loss and eddy current loss in the iron core.) ...|$|R
50|$|For {{pulsation}} above frequency 100 Hz (i.e. {{for high}} speed pumps and all pipe systems shorter than say 80 yards): no <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> devices.For pulsation frequencies below 100 Hz: certain <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> devices of known membrane response characteristics.|$|R
2500|$|Tabor and French {{immigrant}} Lucien Bronicki {{developed a}} small solar power unit, the Organic Rankine cycle turbine, {{for developing countries}} with problematic power grids. [...] It was designed to neutralize the maintenance issues of reciprocating engines so it had only one <b>moving</b> <b>part,</b> the rotor. [...] A 3 kWe prototype was exhibited at the 1961 United Nations Conference on New Sources of Energy in Rome, but it failed to find commercial success.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{practical}} side, Torres built {{a whole series}} of analogue calculating machines, all mechanical. These machines used certain elements known as arithmophores which consisted of a <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> and an index that made it possible to read the quantity according to the position shown thereon. The aforesaid <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> was a graduated disk or a drum turning on an axis. The angular movements were proportional to the logarithms of the magnitudes to be represented. Using a number of such elements, Torres developed a machine that could solve algebraic equations, even one with eight terms, finding the roots, including the complex ones, with a precision down to thousandths. One part of this machine, called an [...] "endless spindle" [...] ("fusee sans fin") and consisting of great mechanical complexity, allowed the mechanical expression of the relation y=log(10^x+1), with the aim of extracting the logarithm of a sum as a sum of logarithms, the same technique which is the basis of the modern electronic Logarithmic Number System. Since an analogical machine was being used, the variable could be of any value (not only discrete prefixed values). With a polynomial equation, the wheels representing the unknown spin round, and the result gives the values of the sum of the variables. When this sum coincides with the value of the second member, the wheel of the unknown shows a root.|$|E
2500|$|Fluorescent lamps using a {{magnetic}} power line frequency ballast {{do not give}} out a steady light; instead, they flicker at twice the supply frequency. This results in fluctuations not only with light output but color temperature as well, which may pose problems for photography {{and people who are}} sensitive to the flicker. Even among persons not sensitive to light flicker, a stroboscopic effect can be noticed, where something spinning at just the right speed may appear stationary if illuminated solely by a single fluorescent lamp. This effect is eliminated by paired lamps operating on a lead-lag ballast. Unlike a true strobe lamp, the light level drops in appreciable time and so substantial [...] "blurring" [...] of the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> would be evident.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1906 Caine’s dramatised {{version of}} The Bondman was {{produced}} in London’s Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, with Mrs Patrick Campbell playing a leading role and Caine's son, Derwent (aged sixteen), making a stage début. [...] A copyright performance had taken place at the Theatre Royal, Bolton in November 1982. Caine revised the play for Arthur Collins, <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> of the story to Sicily and creating a happy ending. The highlight of the show was the sulphur mine explosion and volcano eruption. In April 1906 Collins and Caine had gone on a research trip where they spent a day with Leone Testa, the inspector-general of Sicily’s sulphur mines and while visiting Naples they witnessed Mount Vesuvius erupt. The show ran for eleven weeks followed by eight weeks at the Adelphi Theatre and a revival of The Prodigal Son. The production went on tour in the UK and America.|$|E
2500|$|A {{direct reading}} {{power factor meter}} {{can be made with}} a moving coil meter of the {{electrodynamic}} type, carrying two perpendicular coils on the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> of the instrument. The field of the instrument is energized by the circuit current flow. The two moving coils, A and B, are connected in parallel with the circuit load. [...] One coil, A, will be connected through a resistor and the second coil, B, through an inductor, so that the current in coil B is delayed with respect to current in A. At unity power factor, the current in A is in phase with the circuit current, and coil A provides maximum torque, driving the instrument pointer toward the 1.0 mark on the scale. At zero power factor, the current in coil B is in phase with circuit current, and coil B provides torque to drive the pointer towards 0. At intermediate values of power factor, the torques provided by the two coils add and the pointer takes up intermediate positions.|$|E
2500|$|Most modern demand valves use a {{downstream}} {{rather than}} an upstream valve mechanism. In a downstream valve, the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> of the valve opens {{in the same direction}} as the flow of gas and is kept closed by a spring. The usual form of downstream valve is a spring-loaded poppet with a hard elastomer seat sealing against an adjustable metal [...] "crown" [...] around the inlet orifice. The poppet is lifted away from the crown by a lever operated by the diaphragm. Two patterns are commonly used. One is the classic push-pull arrangement, where the actuating lever goes onto the end of the valve shaft and is held on by a nut. Any deflection of the lever is converted to an axial pull on the valve shaft, lifting the seat off the crown and allowing air to flow. The other is the barrel poppet arrangement, where the poppet is enclosed in a tube which crosses the regulator body and the lever operates through slots in the sides of the tube. The far end of the tube is accessible from the side of the casing and a spring tension adjustment screw may be fitted for limited diver control of the cracking pressure. This arrangement also allows relatively simple pressure balancing of the second stage.|$|E

25|$|Sticking valves:The <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> {{in first}} and second stages have fine {{tolerances}} in places, and some designs {{are more susceptible to}} contaminants causing friction between the <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b> this may increase cracking pressure, reduce flow rate, increase work of breathing or induce free-flow, depending on what part is affected.|$|R
50|$|To {{generate}} electricity a turbine with a generator is necessary. A fuel cell can {{generate electricity}} directly, removing extra <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b> Since fuel cells {{do not have}} any <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> they do not lose energy to friction.
