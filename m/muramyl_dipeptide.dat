Prophylactic treatment with N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-d-isoglutamine gave significant protection against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, and Salmonella enteritidis infection. N-Acetylmuramyl-D-alanyl-D-isoglutamine was unable to confer protection. Incorporation of the lipophilic glycerol dipalmitate derivatives of the two <b>muramyl</b> <b>dipeptides</b> within liposomal carriers resulted in a significant enhancement of anti-infectious activity, both with respect to number of survivors and length of survival.

40|$|AbstractThe {{bacterial}} cell wall <b>muramyl</b> <b>dipeptides</b> MDP and glucosaminyl-MDP (GMDP) are powerful immunostimulators but their binding target remains controversial. We previously reported expression cloning of GMDP-binding polypeptides and identification of Y-box protein 1 (YB- 1) as their sole target. Here we show specific binding of GMDP to recombinant YB- 1 protein and subcellular colocalization of YB- 1 and GMDP. GMDP binding to YB- 1 upregulated gene expression levels of NF-κB 2, a mediator of innate immunity. Furthermore, YB- 1 knockdown abolished GMDP-induced Nfkb 2 expression. GMDP/YB- 1 stimulation led to NF-κB 2 cleavage, transport of activated NF-κB 2 p 52 to the nucleus, and upregulation of NF-κB 2 -dependent chemokine Cxcr 4 gene expression. Therefore, our findings identify YB- 1 as new target for muramyl peptide signaling...|$|R

The mechanism of action and the therapeutic effects of azathioprine, glucocorticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin A, and anticancer drugs will be discussed. The im-munotoxic actions of benzene, polychlorinated and polybrominated biphenyls, tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, various insecticides, metals and abused drugs or drugs with side effects are also described. Immunorestorative approaches are discussed in the second part, based on our current knowledge of the immune system and the lymphokines and hormones involved in its function. The usefulness of thymic hormones, interleukin 2, macrophage growth factorkolony stimulating factor, and interferons as immunotherapeutic agents is considered.

40|$|Serum {{strongly}} induces the yeast-to-hypha growth {{transition in}} the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, playing {{an important role in}} infection. However, identity of the serum inducer(s) and its sensor remain poorly defined.

We then confirmed that several purified and synthetic <b>muramyl</b> <b>dipeptides</b> (MDPs), subunits of PGN, can indeed strongly promote C. albicans hyphal growth. Taking cue from the recognition of MDPs by the mammalian bacterial sensor Nod 2 using its leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) domain, we discovered that MDPs activate the adenylyl cyclase Cyr 1 by binding to its LRR domain.

The fungal adenylyl cyclase Cyr 1 p is {{a key component of}} the cAMP/PKA-signaling pathway that controls diverse infection-related traits, including hyphal morphogenesis. However, identity of the serum hyphal inducer(s) and its fungal sensor remain unknown. Our initial analyses of active serum fractions revealed signs of bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) -like molecules. Here, we show that several purified and synthetic <b>muramyl</b> <b>dipeptides</b> (MDPs), subunits of PGN, can strongly promote C. albicans hyphal growth. Analogous to PGN recognition by the mammalian sensors Nod 1 and Nod 2 through their leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) domain, we show that MDPs activate Cyr 1 p by directly binding to its LRR domain.

Accordingly, this review will highlight a number of those adjuvant substances whose activity in animals indicates a potential use in human vaccines. In addition, the potential of several well-defined substances, termed immunomodulators, which nonspecifically stimulate resistance of animals to multiple 50 % lethal doses of microbial challenge is described.

Administration of 6 -O-acyl-MDP analogs with antigens induced marked enhancement of primary and secondary IgG antibody responses and maintained high antibody levels for at least 7 weeks. Among the analogs tested, an MDP methyl ester carrying a 6 -O- 3 -hexadecanoyl-oxytetradecanoyl group (compound 309) exhibited the most intensive adjuvant activity. Its activity was stronger than that of 6 -O- 2 -tetradecylhexadecanoyl (B 3 O) -MDP used as a positive control.

40|$|X-linked {{inhibitor}} of apoptosis (XIAP) deficiency, {{caused by}} mutations in BIRC 4, is an immunodeficiency associated with immune dysregulation {{and a highly}} variable clinical presentation. Current diagnostic screening tests such as flow cytometry for XIAP expression or lymphocyte apoptosis assays have significant limitations. Based on recent evidence that XIAP is essential for nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domains (NOD) 1 / 2 signalling, we evaluated {{the use of a}} simple flow cytometric assay assessing tumour necrosis factor (TNF) production of monocytes in response to NOD 2 stimulation by <b>muramyl</b> <b>dipeptides</b> (L 18 -MDP) for the functional diagnosis of XIAP deficiency. We investigated 12 patients with XIAP deficiency, six female carriers and relevant disease controls. Irrespective of the diverse clinical phenotype, the extent of residual protein expression or the nature of the mutation, the TNF response was severely reduced in all patients. On average, L 18 -MDP induced TNF production in 25 % of monocytes from healthy donors or female carriers, while fewer than 6 % of monocytes responded in affected patients. Notably, the assay clearly discriminated affected patients from disease controls with other immunodeficiencies accompanied by lymphoproliferation, hypogammaglobulinaemia or inflammatory bowel disease.

The danger molecule can be extracellular ATP, extracellular glucose, crystals of monosodium urate (MSU), calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD), alum, cholesterol or environmental irritants - silica, asbestos, UV irradiation and skin irritants.

While the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of gram-negative bacteria induces monocyte production of IL- 12, the relevant gram-positive components which induce IL- 12 production are uncharacterized. We used the human monocytic cell line THP- 1 to study IL- 12 induction by gram-positive bacteria. <b>Muramyl</b> <b>dipeptides</b> {{as well as the}} major muramyl tetrapeptide component of Streptococcus pneumoniae were inactive for inducing IL- 12. In contrast, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a predominant surface glycolipid of gram-positive bacteria, potently induced IL- 12 p 40 gene expression. A competitive LPS antagonist, Rhodobacter sphaeroides LPS, inhibited LTA-induced IL- 12 production, suggesting a common pathway for LPS and LTA in IL- 12 activation. Pretreatment of cells with anti-CD 14 monoclonal antibody blocked both LPS and LTA induction of IL- 12 p 40 expression. LTA also induced Thl development in naive CD 4 T cells by an IL- 12 -dependent mechanism, indicating direct induction of physiologic levels of IL- 12. Together, these results show that LTA is a potent surface structure of gram-positive bacteria which induces IL- 12 in monocytes through a CD 14 -mediated pathway...|$|R
40|$|We have {{observed}} that murine macrophages can be activated for enhanced neutral protease secretion by exposing the cells to <b>muramyl</b> <b>dipeptides</b> (MDPs). A lipophilic derivative of nor-MDP is more efficacious than the parent hydrophilic nor-MDP. The efficacy and potency of the lipophilic and more prominently the hydrophilic drugs can be increased (10 - 10 (3) fold) by encapsulating them in lipid vesicles (liposomes); however the encapsulation of drug causes a delay in the onset of activation. The enhanced effectiveness of liposomal MDPs seems in part, {{to be due to}} increased uptake, slow release and thus potentiated action of the drug at intracellular sites as emphasized by studies with [3 H]-MDP. Appropriate distribution of the drug to intracellular compartments of the cell also seems to be an important factor in the activation process. The internalization of a relatively large amounts (greater than 5 ng/ 10 (6) cells) of nor-MDP results in 'down regulation', that is reduced protease secretion, as compared to effects produced by internalization of lesser amounts of the drug. The macrophage activating effects of liposomal MDPs do not seem to require the processing of liposomes in the lysosomal compartment; thus lysosome-blocking agents, such as chloroquine and dextran sulphate, do not affect the induction of protease secretion...|$|R

A PG isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes, PG subunit polymer and dimer obtained from Staphylococcus epidermidis, and water-soluble fragments of cell walls or PG prepared from Nocardia corynebacteriodes and Streptomyces gardneri were found to enhance both the primary and secondary responses of anti-OA immunoglobulin E antibody production. It was suggested that the PG portion, either intact or highly degraded, was capable of enhancing the immunoglobulin E antibody production, and {{there was no need for}} the non-PG moiety or intactness of PG structure for the adjuvant activity. This finding was confirmed and extended by the use of synthetic MurNAc dipeptides. Among eight MurNAc dipeptides tested, MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln, MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Gln, MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu, and MurNAc-l-Ser-d-isoGln were found active as an adjuvant in the stimulation of the primary and secondary reaginic anti-OA antibody production in a similar way to the cell wall PG and their fragments. None of the synthetic MurNAc-l-Ala-l-isoGln, MurNAc-l-Ala-l-Gln, MurNAc-l-Ala-l-Glu, and MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoAsn, on the other hand, stimulated the anti-OA immunoglobulin E antibody production in either primary or secondary response, indicating the importance for the adjuvancy in immunoglobulin E production of the configuration of the glutamic acid residues adjacent to the l-Ala (or l-Ser) in <b>muramyl</b> <b>dipeptides...</b>|$|R

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{microbial}} factors that may cause the typical septic inflammatory cascade. An invading pathogen is recognized by its pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Examples of PAMPs include lipopolysaccharides and flagellin in gram-negative bacteria, <b>muramyl</b> <b>dipeptide</b> in the peptidoglycan of the gram-positive bacterial cell wall, and CpG bacterial DNA. These PAMPs are recognized by the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system, which may be membrane-bound or cytosolic. There are four families of PRRs: the toll-like receptors, the C-type lectin receptors, the NOD-like receptors, and the RIG-I-like receptors. Invariably, the association of a PAMP and a PRR will cause a series of intracellular signalling cascades. Consequentially, transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa B and activator protein-1, will up-regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.|$|E

Cell wall and peptidoglycan preparations, isolated from 19 strains belonging to 18 different species, definitely increased [3 H]thymidine {{incorporation of}} thymocytes as well as splenocytes, regardless of mycolic acid contents as a non-peptidoglycan component. Both the cell walls from Nocardia corynebacteriodes (containing mycolic acids) and those from Streptomyces gardneri (lacking mycolic acids) showed far stronger mitogenic activities on splenocytes than other cell walls (stimulation index, 25 to 30). Furthermore, water-soluble enzymatic digests, notably the endopeptidase digests, which generally were greater in degree of polymerization of peptidoglycan subunits than the glycosidase digests obtained from representative cell walls, were found to have as distinct a stimulating activity on splenocytes as the original cell walls. In contrast, solubilization of the cell walls by enzymes, irrespective of endopeptidases or glycosidases, was accompanied by disappearance of the mitogenic activity on thymocytes. On the other hand, studies with synthetic 6 -O-acyl-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln preparations (6 -O-acyl-MDPs) revealed that 6 -O-stearoyl-MDP and 6 -O-(2 -tetradecylhexadecanoyl) -MDP, unlike MDP, had distinct mitogenic activity on thymocytes, whereas their activity on splenocytes was rather weaker than MDP itself. The findings presented here suggest that MDP is the minimal structure for the mitogenic activities of bacterial cell walls on guinea pig splenocytes, but that MDP, though distinctively active by itself, requires a polymerized form to exert effectively its inherent stimulating activities on splenocytes. On the other hand, on thymocytes, MDP, unless it takes a particular form or has appropriate additive groups, cannot exert its mitogenic activities...|$|R

We evaluated the ability of a novel synthetic lipid A analog with low endotoxicity, DT- 5461, to antagonize LPS-induced IL- 1 and TNF-alpha production in cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage and examined the protective effect of DT- 5461 against lethal endotoxic shock in mice. The IL- 1 - or TNF-alpha-inducing activity of DT- 5461 is 100, 000 to 10, 000 times less active than that of Escherichia coli LPS (EcLPS) or synthetic lipid A. DT- 5461 significantly inhibited EcLPS-induced IL- 1 and TNF-alpha release when murine peritoneal macrophages were incubated with DT- 5461 2 h prior to EcLPS stimulation at the same concentration (1 microgram/ml). The antagonistic effect of DT- 5461 on the production of IL- 1 and TNF-alpha induced by EcLPS occurred in a concentration-dependent manner. DT- 5461 also inhibited IL- 1 and TNF-alpha induction when murine peritoneal macrophages were stimulated by LPS from Salmonella typhimurium or synthetic lipid A, as well as by EcLPS, but not by <b>muramyl</b> <b>dipeptides.</b> This indicated that DT- 5461 specifically antagonized the action of LPS. DT- 5461 also antagonized EcLPS-mediated activation of human peripheral blood monocytes. DT- 5461 blocked the binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled LPS to murine peritoneal macrophages as well as it did the binding of EcLPS and synthetic lipid A, i. e., in a concentration-dependent fashion. Injection of DT- 5461 2 h before EcLPS challenge prevented the production of serum IL- 1 and TNF-alpha in D-galactosamine-treated mice. Furthermore, this treatment modality protected mice against LPS-induced lethal toxicity. This study suggests that DT- 5461 possesses a potent LPS antagonistic effect and may be useful in a protective strategy against lethal endotoxemia caused by gram-negative bacterial infection...|$|R

Nevertheless, the use of CFA is scientifically justified in many systems, such as the induction of autoimmune disease models for which no comparable alternatives exist. The effect of associated local and/or systemic pain and distress of the research animal should be evaluated along with the scientific benefit that may be gained from the experiment. Scope This policy applies to all adjuvants used in animal research. This includes but is not limited to: I. currently licensed adjuvants such as aluminum compounds (e. g., Alum), MF 59, liposomes, and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL); Policy: II. adjuvants in pre-clinical development such as Montanides, polymeric microparticles, flagellin, saponins (e. g., Quil A, QS- 21), RC 529 (synthetic MPL + Alum), cytokines, and immunostimulatory nucleic acids (e. g., Iscom, CpG oligonucleotides); III. emerging adjuvants such as virus-like particles, nanoparticles, TLR agonists, <b>muramyl</b> <b>dipeptides,</b> tripeptides (e. g., MDP, MTP), and trehalose dimycolate (TDM); and, IV. procedures or emulsions such as subcutaneously-implanted chambers, TiterMax, EMULSIGENS, Syntex Adjuvant Formulation (SAF), and Specol. I. The use of any adjuvant {{must be approved by}} the IACUC. Scientific justification is required for the use of any adjuvant (e. g., CFA) that could induce a severe reaction or cause local and/or systemic pain and distress to the animal. II. When consistent with the scientific objectives (e. g. routine antibody collection) adjuvants known to produce less intense inflammatory responses must be considered as alternatives to CFA. III. CFA should be used responsibly and with care in order to avoid or minimize the adverse effects of excessive inflammation. For most applications, CFA is usually necessary only for the initial immunization, while Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant, which lacks mycobacteria, is the adjuvant of choice for subsequent immunizations. Successive immunizations with CFA must be scientifically justified and approved by th...|$|R
