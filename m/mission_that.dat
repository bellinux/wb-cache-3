5|$|An enquiry {{into the}} crash was hastily set up. The commission's report (Aktenzeichen 52, Br.B.Nr. 270/42) {{concluded}} that the crash was caused by damage to the differential gear, which caused an oil leak. Then a number of teeth broke off the spur wheel and ignited the oil. Sabotage or human error was ruled out. The aircraft, W. Nr. 14256, was ferried to the unit via Bari, Italy. The <b>mission</b> <b>that</b> ended in its destruction was its first mission.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 an {{agreement}} was signed between the DGAM and the Italian General Direction for Development Cooperation for a joint mission to renovate and reorganize the citadel and the National Museum of Damascus.

5|$|According to his biographer Roland Huntford, the {{references}} to Shackleton's physical breakdown made in Scott's The Voyage of the Discovery, published in 1905, reopened the wounds to Shackleton's pride. It became a personal <b>mission</b> <b>that</b> he should return to the Antarctic and outperform Scott. He began looking for potential backers for an expedition of his own; his initial plans appear in an unpublished document dated early 1906. These include a cost estimate of £17,000 (updated value £) for the entire expedition. He received his first promise of financial backing when early in 1907 his employer, Beardmore, offered a £7,000 loan guarantee (updated value £). With this in hand, Shackleton felt confident enough to announce his intentions to the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) on 12 February 1907. One reason for Shackleton's sense of urgency was {{the knowledge that the}} Polish explorer Henryk Arctowski was planning an expedition, which was announced at the RGS on the same day as Shackleton's. In the event, Arctowski's plans were stillborn.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{reinforcement}} {{effort to}} Guadalcanal was delayed, the Japanese {{did not give}} up trying to complete the original mission, albeit a day later than originally planned. On the afternoon of 13 November, Tanaka and the 11transports resumed their journey toward Guadalcanal. A Japanese force of cruisers and destroyers from the 8th Fleet (based primarily at Rabaul and originally assigned to cover the unloading of the transports {{on the evening of}} 13 November) was given the <b>mission</b> <b>that</b> Abe's force had failed to carry out—the bombardment of Henderson Field. The battleship Kirishima, after abandoning its rescue effort of Hiei on the morning of 13 November, steamed north between Santa Isabel and Malaita Islands with her accompanying warships to rendezvous with Kondo's Second Fleet, inbound from Truk, to form the new bombardment unit.|$|E

5|$|Having decisively won {{the battle}} and once again turned the tide {{of the war in}} favor of the Communists, the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River {{represented}} the peak of the Chinese military's performance in Korea. However, Mao interpreted the UN ceasefire as a weakness that China should further exploit. Against advice from Peng and other senior military leaders, Mao ordered the PVA to invade South Korea—a <b>mission</b> <b>that</b> was beyond the Chinese military's abilities while breaking the fragile Chinese supply lines. Recognizing the Chinese difficulties, Ridgway then led the Eighth Army to inflict severe losses on the PVA during the Chinese offensives of 1951.|$|E
5|$|In June 1968, an {{automobile}} {{he was driving}} in southern France was hit by another vehicle, seriously injuring him and killing one of his passengers, {{the wife of the}} mission president. Romney then became co-president of a <b>mission</b> <b>that</b> had become demoralized and disorganized after the May 1968 general strike and student uprisings and the car accident. With Romney rallying the others, the mission met its goal of 200baptisms for the year, the most in a decade. By the end of his stint in December 1968, he was overseeing the work of 175others. As a result of his experience there, Romney developed a lifelong affection for France and its people and has also remained fluent in French.|$|E
5|$|In May 2006, an auto-update {{was made}} {{available}} on Xbox Live, responsible for fixing some bugs and adding additional multiplayer options to the game. The bug fixes included code {{to prevent an}} ongoing problem where players could walk through the air, an issue where some weapons could make use of rapid fire, and a map-exiting glitch, among others. The new multiplayer options provide seven additional new bot types {{and the ability to}} use bots in DarkOps matches, since bots had only one AI variant and were only available in DeathMatch scenarios when the game was released. Additionally, a playable demo of the game was made freely available on the Xbox Live Marketplace shortly afterwards. The demo includes one campaign <b>mission</b> <b>that</b> can be played in solo mode or co-operatively, and a new multiplayer map.|$|E

5|$|In {{that first}} {{election}} {{he was in}} favour of Henryk II Walezy (later, Henry III of France). Subsequently, {{he was part of}} the diplomatic <b>mission</b> <b>that</b> traveled to France to finish formalities with the newly elected king. He also published a pamphlet praising the new king, and thus suffered a loss of face when Henryk secretly abandoned Poland and returned to France. During the following 1575 election he was a vocal enemy of the Habsburg dynasty and its candidate, and this anti-Habsburg stance, resounding among the lesser nobility, helped him regain his popularity. For the king, Zamoyski championed the case of a Polish candidate, which ended up in the marriage of Anna Jagiellon with the anti-Habsburg Stephen Bathory of Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|Mercury-Atlas 8 (MA-8) was {{the fifth}} United States manned space mission, part of NASA's Mercury program. Astronaut Walter M. Schirra Jr., orbited the Earth six times in the Sigma 7 {{spacecraft}} on October 3, 1962, in a nine-hour flight focused mainly on technical evaluation rather than on scientific experimentation. This was the longest U.S. manned orbital flight yet achieved in the Space Race, though well behind the several-day record set by the Soviet Vostok 3 earlier in the year. It confirmed the Mercury spacecraft's durability ahead of the one-day Mercury-Atlas 9 <b>mission</b> <b>that</b> followed in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, the NHC {{immediately}} classified {{the system}} as Tropical Storm Earl based on a Hurricane Hunter Reconnaissance <b>mission</b> <b>that</b> found flight-level winds of 49mph (79km/h), corresponding to surface winds of 40mph (65km/h). Due {{to the existence of}} multiple circulation centers, the initial movement of the storm was uncertain, but forecasters anticipated a general northward movement. In post-season analysis, it was determined that the system intensified into Tropical Storm Earl while located about 575miles (925km) south-southwest of New Orleans. Initial advisories on Earl relocated the center of circulation several times before focusing on the true circulation center.|$|E

5|$|STS-300 was the {{designation}} for the Space Shuttle Launch on Need (LON) missions {{to be launched}} on short notice for STS-114 and STS-121, {{in the event that}} the shuttle became disabled or damaged and could not safely return to Earth. The rescue flight for STS-115, if needed, would have been STS-301. After STS-115, the rescue mission designations were based on the corresponding regular <b>mission</b> <b>that</b> would be replaced should the rescue mission be needed. For example, the STS-116 rescue mission was branded STS-317, because the normal mission scheduled after STS-116 was STS-117. Should the rescue mission have been needed, the crew and vehicle for STS-117 would assume the rescue mission profile and become STS-317. All potential rescue missions were to be launched with a crew of four, and would return with ten or eleven crew members, depending on the number of crew launched on the rescued shuttle. Missions were expected to last approximately eleven days. None of the planned contingency missions was ever flown.|$|E
5|$|Sadler {{graduated}} from Battle Creek College in 1894 and subsequently worked for John Kellogg's brother, William K. Kellogg as a health-food salesman.
