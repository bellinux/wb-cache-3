For the show's title sequence, graphic designer Chris Harvey put together the images, and music group tomandandy wrote the TV Nation theme. After completing the pilot in three months, both NBC executives and focus groups were highly impressed with the show. But without room in their fall 1993 schedule, NBC indefinitely delayed committing to a full season. That winter, the head of BBC2 heard about the pilot, and after watching it offered to buy the show. With firm interest in the show, NBC offered to put TV Nation into its summer 1994 lineup.|$|E

Frederick and his group supported the Opera of the Nobility in Lincoln's Inn Fields as a rival to Handel's royally sponsored opera at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket. Frederick was a lover of music who played the viola and cello; he is depicted playing a cello in a portrait by Philip Mercier of Frederick and his sisters, {{now part of the}} National Portrait Gallery collection. He enjoyed the natural sciences and the arts, and became a thorn in the side of his parents, <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of opposing them in everything, according to the court gossip Lord Hervey.

25|$|Shakespeare satirizes the {{hyperbole}} of the allusions used {{by conventional}} poets, which {{even by the}} Elizabethan era, had become cliché, predictable, and uninspiring. This sonnet compares the poet's mistress {{to a number of}} natural beauties; each time <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of his mistress' obvious inadequacy in such comparisons; she cannot hope {{to stand up to the}} beauties of the natural world. The first two quatrains compare the speaker's mistress to aspects of nature, such as snow or coral; each comparison ending unflatteringly for the mistress. In the final couplet, the speaker proclaims his love for his mistress by declaring that he makes no false comparisons, the implication being that other poets do precisely that. Shakespeare's sonnet aims to do the opposite, by indicating that his mistress is the ideal object of his affections because of her genuine qualities, and that she is more worthy of his love than the paramours of other poets who are more fanciful.|$|E

[...] At Metacritic the film has received an average score of 86, based on 34 reviews. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, [...] "The movie is powerful precisely because it doesn't preach.

Stephen Holden, in his review for The New York Times, wrote, [...] "Traffic is an utterly gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller.

In his review for The New York Observer, Andrew Sarris wrote, [...] "Traffic marks [...] definitively as an enormous talent, one who never lets us guess what he's going to do next.
