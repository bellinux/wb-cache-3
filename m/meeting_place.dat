40|$|As a case study, {{young people}} visiting youth clubs and similar <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> {{in a local}} council in {{northern}} Sweden, was explored in terms of place, space and activities of the club or <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> and discussed in the perspective {{of social and cultural}} transformation. To collect data over a 6 -month period, several visits were carried out to the youth clubs and similar <b>meeting</b> <b>places.</b> During the visits, notes and photographs were taken of the physical environment of the clubs. As a theoretical framework, theories of citizenship were used. The following questions are of special interest: where are these <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> located; what kind of visitors do they attract; what kind of activities do they offer; how do visitors use the space and what kind of citizenship do they support? The results of the study show first that these places are more attractive to boys than to girls. Second, youth clubs and similar <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> offer many activities for both boys and girls, which are used in a traditional female or male context. Third, those who visit youth clubs and similar <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> at their leisure time are offered the opportunity of taking an active role in their transition to citizenship.

40|$|In {{previous}} research, <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> {{have been}} favourably addressed by service users, {{but they have}} also been contested as exclusionary. In this participatory explorative study, we sought to perform a contextual analysis of <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> in Norway based on a discourse analysis of three focus group discussions with 15 staff members. We asked the following question: how do meeting-place employees discuss their concrete and abstract encounters with service users and their experiences? We focused on service user involvement, which was largely analysed as neoliberal consultation and responsibilisation. Service users were positioned as resisting responsibility trickling down and defending staffed <b>meeting</b> <b>places.</b> Social democratic discourse was identified in the gaps of neoliberal discourse, which is noteworthy given that Norway is a social democracy.

40|$|The {{literature}} that describes what makes city spaces and <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> good, {{are based on}} and targeted towards urban villages and cities. Is this knowledge directly transferable to villages in western Norway (Vestlandet) in rural environments? The populations in these areas are lower and more spread geographically, {{in addition to having}} different challenges and strengths than cities. This paper therefore asks the question: What design principles should be the foundation for creating outdoor <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> in centers of small, rural villages in Vestlandet? The example village used for this paper was Sandane village in the municipality of Gloppen. To answer this question, I have looked at national guidelines for district development, and researched city space and city life literature. I’ve compared this to strengths and challenges that are characteristics typical of small, rural villages in Vestlandet, in addition to personal experience and surveys I have done in Sandane. The main takeaway from this paper is that designing <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> in isolation is not good enough. The foundations for <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> in the villages are too weak to make people want to spend time in them. It is necessary to work holistically to strengthen the village center to make it an attractive place to be. My claim is therefore that creating good <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> in village centers is as much about development of the village center as it is about the physical design of the <b>meeting</b> <b>places.</b> The result is a toolbox of design principles that should serve as a foundation for planning and designing <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> in the rural village centers of Vestlandet. But this is just a tool. It is paramount that projects are tailored to the individual cases, based on cooperation with the local population and knowledge about the relevant strengths and challenges of the village...|$|R

5|$|In 2008, {{controversy}} {{between the}} local organisation Galleri Texas and the state-owned corporation Follo Futura arose, regarding the hiring contract {{of the station}} building, and which of them were to operate the cultural <b>meeting</b> <b>place.</b> Follo Futura, which together with the Norwegian National Rail Administration and Rom Eiendom officially owned the station building wanted {{to take over the}} café business. They argued that they were better fit to operate it, since Galleri Texas did not have the economical capacity to run the café with the art exhibition and gift shop the whole week. The local community wanted Galleri Texas to operate the café, arguing that replacing a local company for a governmental one would weaken the local and patriotic spirit of the café. On 1 January 2010, the operation of the café and the cultural <b>meeting</b> <b>place</b> was transferred from Galleri Texas to Follo Futura, since Galleri Texas no longer could pay the rental costs. In 2010, smoke was tumbling out of the station, but it turned out that it was only a cigarette that had not been quenched, and had been laying overnight in a flower basket.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{the idea}} of <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> for parents and their {{children}} has increasingly gained importance in the context of parent support in Belgium. <b>Meeting</b> <b>places</b> for {{parents and their children}} have existed for a long time already in other countries (e. g. the “Maison Vertes” in France, and the “spazio insieme” in Italy) and these have been an important source of inspiration for the Belgian cases (see e. g. Vandenbroeck et al., 2007, 2009 a). <b>Meeting</b> <b>places</b> usually are houses – frequently called “open houses” – that are reorganized {{in such a way as}} to allow a number of parents and their children to come by and spend some time there. The interest in <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> is to be understood as a reaction to formal kinds of support for parents (c. q. mostly professional advice in institutionalized settings) and, connected to this, in response to what parents themselves have expressed as being in need of in a number of surveys (see e. g. the research rapport by Buysse, 2008, which is frequently being referred to in Flanders in this context). Parents themselves have indicated a lack of informal networks, and wish to have the opportunity to share their concerns and worries with likeminded people (i. e. other parents, more of less sharing the same experiences) instead of talking about (bringing up) their children with professionals. <b>Meeting</b> <b>places</b> for parents and their children are said to offer this opportunity for informal social contacts; places where parents can find emotional and social support for what can sometimes be the very tough task of bringing up their children. In the literature, this idea of <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> is connected to {{the idea of}} a pedagogy of the encounter. 	This paper is a first attempt at critically discussing what is entailed in these ideas of <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> and encounter. It is important to keep in mind that I will only focus here on the Flemish cases, c. q. on how the idea of <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> for parents and their children has been conceptualized here until now. To provide some background, I will first go into how parent support is most commonly understood in Flanders (1.). In the second section I will highlight some characteristic features of <b>meeting</b> <b>places.</b> I will not go into detail, but only focus on those aspects which are most relevant for this paper, c. q. the relation to socialization, to the idea of encounter, and to the idea of relational citizenship (2.). Third, I will discuss some difficulties which I think are connected to the current understanding of <b>meeting</b> <b>places.</b> My purpose is to try to show the “conceptual struggles”, so to speak, related to the development of what is undeniably, at least in my opinion, an interesting and promising social practice seeking to support parents in bringing up their children in a societal context that is markedly different from that of a few decades ago. In the concluding section (4.), I will, in a very preliminary way, try to sketch the outlines of an alternative conceptualization of what can be entailed in the idea of <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> for parents and their children, in order to open this up for further discussion and investigation. status: publishe...|$|R
