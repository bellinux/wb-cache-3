5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with <b>me,</b> <b>without</b> wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

[...] "I feel like I haven't been working in a particularly flashy or visible way," [...] she reflected to Vogue magazine. [...] "If you weren't looking for them, you would miss the movies that I've made that I'm proud of." [...] For <b>Me</b> <b>Without</b> You (2001), Williams co-starred with Anna Friel. The movie's reception was split, with review aggregator website, Rotten Tomatoes, assigning it a 66% rating based on 65 reviews. Next was Prozac Nation (2002), starring Christina Ricci {{and based on the}} autobiography of the same name by Elizabeth Wurtzel. It portrayed her struggle with major depression. Asked if her roommate role was interesting to play, Williams said: [...] "I think what it needed to be was helpful.

500|$|In January 2006, nine tracks {{recorded}} for the album were {{leaked to the}} Internet. In response to the leak, Garrett Tierney stated [...] "I would say it {{did it in a}} good way 'cause so many people were curious to hear what we have been doing—and for the most part, the record tracks don't sound anything like the leaked demos." [...] However, Lacey was not so upbeat when asked, saying, [...] "For me it was different. It had me pretty down for a while. No one likes to show their creation in mid-process, and those songs weren't done. They were like blueprints. Just the plan, right? It put me in a state where I {{was under the impression that}} those songs had been wasted or something—that we had to go and write new things because those had been heard. Now, in retrospect, I want those songs to be on the album and many of them aren't, and I'm probably more to blame for that than anyone. This record already feels incomplete to <b>me</b> <b>without</b> those tracks and probably will forever." ...|$|E

Writing for the NME, Ted Kessler described the track as [...] "Status Quo for Generation X-ers with a Manhattan Portage full of millennial tension" [...] and went on to ask [...] "who said there was anything wrong with that?" [...] in his review of the song on its release as a single, despite his earlier review of Rings Around the World claiming that the album would benefit from the removal of the [...] "Status Quo-ish title track". Q described the track as [...] "excellent" [...] while PopMatters claimed the song [...] "sounds so much like ELO that it blows away everything on last year's ELO reunion album" [...] and the Dallas Observer stated that [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] is a [...] "Beach Boys/Beatles/ELO homage as fine as the '70s heyday of Roy Wood's Wizzard or very early Cheap Trick".Pitchfork Media stated that the song [...] "takes the upbeat Britpop of their debut album and layers on spectral details" [...] while Uncut described the track as [...] "tooled up rock 'n' roll modelled on [...] "Surfin' USA". The Guardian claimed the song's lyrics tackle environmental issues with a [...] "sharp wit" [...] while Drowned in Sound saw them as evidence that chief songwriter Gruff Rhys was [...] "taking his lyrics a little bit more seriously". The song was placed at number 21 in the 2001 Festive Fifty on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show.
