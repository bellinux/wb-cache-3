This is remarkable, as the charge made is only 4d. per night, or 2s. a week, even for a cubicle, and an excellent breakfast of bread and butter, fish, and tea can be had for 2d. Other meals are supplied on a like scale, with the result that a woman employed in outside work can live in considerable comfort in a room or cubicle of her own for about 8s. a week.|$|R

5|$|During Barry's career, he was {{credited}} with saving the lives of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>forty</b> people, although this number has sometimes varied over the years.

After warming up the boy's body sufficiently by licking him, he moved the boy about and onto his back and carried the child back to the hospice. The child survived and was returned to his parents, although other sources say that the boy's mother died in the avalanche that trapped the boy. The Museum of Natural History in Bern disputes the legend, attributing it to Peter Scheitlin, an animal psychologist.|$|E

5|$|In 1896, Frank Oliver, who had {{represented}} Edmonton in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories since 1888, {{resigned to}} pursue a career in federal politics. Several Strathcona residents urged Rutherford to run for Oliver's old seat in the ensuing by-election. Though he was originally reluctant, he agreed to stand after a 300-signature petition urging his candidacy was presented to him. His only opponent was former Edmonton mayor Matthew McCauley who, like Rutherford, ran as an independent. Rutherford campaigned on a platform of improved roads, resource development, simplification of territorial ordinances, and—in what would become a theme of his political career—increased educational funding. McCauley won the election, but Rutherford received <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>forty</b> percent of the vote.|$|E

Minas Geraes was taken under tow on 1 March 1954 and arrived in Genoa on 22 April; the old dreadnought, which had been in service for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>forty</b> years, was broken up for scrap later that year.|$|E
5|$|Recruited {{by several}} firms in 1975, Romney joined the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), {{reasoning}} that {{working as a}} management consultant {{for a variety of}} companies would better prepare him for a future position as a chief executive. Part of a 1970s wave of top graduates who chose to go into consulting rather than join a large company directly, he found his legal and business education useful in his job. He applied BCG principles such as the growth-share matrix, and executives viewed him as having a bright future there. At the Boston Consulting Group, he was a colleague of Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom he formed a friendship that has lasted for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>forty</b> years.|$|E

5|$|Saint-Saëns wrote <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>forty</b> chamber works {{between the}} 1840s and his last years. One {{of the first}} of his major works in the genre was the Piano Quintet (1855). It is a straightforward, {{confident}} piece, in a conventional structure with lively outer movements and a central movement containing two slow themes, one chorale-like and the other cantabile. The Septet (1880), for the unusual combination of trumpet, two violins, viola, cello, double bass and piano, is a neoclassical work that draws on 17th-century French dance forms. At the time of its composition Saint-Saëns was preparing new editions of the works of baroque composers including Rameau and Lully.|$|E

5|$|The Polish–Lithuanian {{national}} contingent {{was organized}} in traditional formations {{dating back to}} the earlier medieval times, with chorągiew (banner) unit, commanded by a rotmistrz and composed of smaller poczet (lance) retinues, each composed of one towarzysz and a varying number of aides. The size of a chorągiew could vary from as little as 60 to as many as 300 men. Two or more choragwie (through rarely <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a dozen, and never <b>more</b> <b>than</b> about <b>forty)</b> formed a regiment (pułk) unit, a type of a unit similar to the medieval battle or modern division or corps. Its senior commander was known as pułkownik (colonel). The foreign contingent was organized into regiments, often numbering around 500-1,000, and divided into companies. King John III Sobieski made an attempt in the 1670s to replace the national-foreign contingent divisions with a single structure, dividing units into infantry, cavalry and dragoons, but it would take many decades before those reforms bore fruit.|$|R
