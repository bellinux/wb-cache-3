In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the European Union and globally through institutions such as La Francophonie.

25|$|Metropolitan France has a {{wide variety}} of {{topographical}} sets and natural landscapes. Large parts of the current territory of France were raised during several tectonic episodes like the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, during which the Armorican Massif, the Massif Central, the Morvan massif, the Vosges and Ardennes ranges and the island of Corsica were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine basin in the southwest and the Paris basin in the north,the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of Beauce and Brie. Various routes of natural passage, such as the Rhône valley, allow easy communications. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. The highest peak of the Alps is Mont-Blanc at 4809 metres above sea level. Although 60% of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks, these risks remain moderate. The coastlines offer contrasting landscapes: mountain ranges along the French Riviera, coastal cliffs such as the Côte d'Albâtre, and wide sandy plains in the Languedoc. The river system of France comprises the four major rivers Loire, Seine, Garonne and Rhône and their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over 62% of the <b>metropolitan</b> <b>territory.</b> Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the north-eastern borders. France has 11 million square kilometres of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which 97% are overseas.|$|E

What can be particularly observed is the spreading of closed polderized housing developments (CPHD), the new forms of production in residential areas on the borders of the metropolitan conglomerate of Buenos Aires, whose development implies an extensive demand of the soil in areas of great patrimonial value and environmental fragility, like the wetlands in the lower basin of the Río Luján. From such a perspective, this work contributes elements which allow for a characterization and dimensioning of the phenomenon, based on a thorough surveying of the variables deemed essential by the study, by comparing databases from public institutions, journalistic information and real estate developers' web sites from the area...|$|R

We propose a comparison between two ways {{to react to the}} farming system crisis in Northern or in Southern countries in focusing on changing supplying networks of fresh products (organic and quality products in Stockholm and conventional ones in Buenos Aires). In Buenos Aires or in Stockholm, agricultural systems are changed by players coming from the outside of agricultural systems where they settle in, and organized into community networks. They have introduced a more small-scale, familial and intensive agriculture and created shorter supplying networks to connect production and marketing activities (wholesale market in Buenos Aires, farmers' markets in Stockholm). These agricultural and social innovations are the fruits of initiatives from the bottom taken up by the State and the political authorities, which have some legislative tools to ratify territorial resettings vis-a-vis land stakes. Both political attitudes are meeting the same need for socio-territorial sustainability, as much as an environmental sustainability...|$|R

Metropolitan management, whose main agent is the State, appears as an important tool to exercise control over the land use planning of such territories, since the state political institutions - government and public administration - would operate under permanent pressure {{of the interests of}} capital. Based on this premise, it is assumed that a highly coercive management model would prevail in the sense of centralizing decision by the state apparatus and imposing an agenda of public policies that would favor the production and appropriation of the territory by economic agents. In order to make possible a classification of the existing types of metropolitan management, an analysis instrument was created based on a referential frame with the different types according to the characteristics of the political process of the management. Two case studies were then selected for application of the proposed methodology: the management of the Metropolitan Area of Lisbon, in Portugal, and the metropolitan regions of the state of S?o Paulo, both chosen for the particularities they present in different contexts and for the possibility of comparing the types found. Based on these cases, the aim was to demonstrate the tendency to prevail the coercive model in the contemporary metropolitan management, to the detriment of a territorial cohesion model, which would operate towards a more democratic management, with an agenda based on the reduction of socioeconomic inequalities, which are expressed more severely in the <b>metropolitan</b> <b>territories...</b>|$|R
