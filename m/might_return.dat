5|$|After the season, it {{was rumored}} that the Redskins were {{interested}} in promoting him to replace head coach Turk Edwards, but the franchise denied it and Shaughnessy {{would not comment on}} his plans. In January 1947, he quit as Maryland coach, stating {{that he did not want}} to remain athletic director or resign from the Washington Redskins, both of which the school wanted. Shaughnessy said he would work full-time for the Redskins for the remaining year on his contract, and <b>might</b> <b>return</b> to coach only college football at the end of his term, possibly with Maryland. President Byrd affirmed that Shaughnessy's poor 1946 record was not related to his departure. He was replaced by split T proponent Jim Tatum.|$|E

5|$|As the Browns {{climbed to}} the top of the NFL, {{speculation}} began to mount that Brown <b>might</b> <b>return</b> to the Buckeyes. Wes Felser had resigned as the team's coach, and Brown was seen as a possible replacement. But Brown had also alienated many Ohio State alumni by failing to return to the school after World War II and for signing away players including Groza before their college eligibility expired. He interviewed with the university's athletic board on January 27, 1951, but the board unanimously rejected Brown in favor of Woody Hayes, who was unanimously endorsed by the board of trustees.|$|E
5|$|However, Sitchin, {{who died}} in 2010, denied any {{connection}} between his work and Lieder's claims. In 2007, partly in response to Lieder's proclamations, Sitchin published a book, The End of Days, which set {{the time for the}} last passing of Nibiru by Earth at 556 BC, which would mean, given the object's supposed 3,600-year orbit, that it would return sometime around AD 2900. He did however say that he believed that the Annunaki <b>might</b> <b>return</b> earlier by spaceship, and that the timing of their return would coincide with the shift from the astrological Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius, sometime between 2090 and 2370.|$|E
5|$|In {{his search}} for a new career Thorpe applied unsuccessfully for the posts of {{administrator}} of the Aldeburgh festival, and race relations adviser to the Greater London Council. His attempts to restart a career in television also came to nothing. In February 1982 it was announced that he was to become director of the British section of Amnesty International, but the appointment was opposed by many of the organisation's membership, and after a month of controversy Thorpe withdrew from the post. He kept his position as chairman of the political committee of the United Nations Association, but in 1985 the progression of Parkinson's disease, which had first been diagnosed in 1979, led to the curtailment of most of his public activity. He continued to live in North Devon, and in 1987 accepted the honorary presidency of the North Devon Liberal Democrat association, formed after the Liberal–SDP merger. He thought he <b>might</b> <b>return</b> to parliament via a life peerage in the House of Lords, but although friends lobbied on his behalf, the merged party's leadership refused to recommend him. Within the party generally, feelings towards him warmed, and when he attended the 1997 annual conference he received a standing ovation.|$|E

5|$|Parseghian, who was 51 at the time, said {{he planned}} to take at least a year off from {{coaching}} before considering a run at a job in the professional ranks. Rumors circulated throughout 1975 that he <b>might</b> <b>return</b> to Notre Dame, but both he and Devine denied them. He finally decided that December that he would not coach in 1976 despite reportedly being pursued by the New York Jets of the NFL, but would instead host a television show beginning the following fall. His last coaching appearance was with the college players in the annual Chicago College All-Star Game against the defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers on July 23, 1976 at Chicago's Soldier Field. The game was halted in the second half when a torrential thunderstorm broke out. Fans rushed onto the field, and play was never resumed. It was the last such game ever played.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September {{the family}} moved to 42 Brunswick Terrace, Brighton on the south coast of England where tranquillity of life contrasted greatly with the revolutionary Europe left behind. Parliamentary figures, {{particularly}} Disraeli, travelled down to visit them, as did Metternich's former friend Dorothea Lieven (Melanie led a reconciliation between the two). Expecting a visit from Metternich's daughter Leontine and her own daughter Pauline, {{the family moved}} to a suite of rooms at Richmond Palace on 23 April 1849. Visitors included Wellington, who still watched out for Metternich; Johann Strauss, the composer; and Dorothea de Dino, sister of Metternich's former lover Wilhemine of Sagan; and former lover Katharina Bagration. Metternich was showing his age, and his frequent fainting was cause for worry. The ex-Chancellor was also depressed by the lack of communication from the new Emperor Franz Joseph I and his government. Leontine wrote to Vienna trying to encourage this contact, and in August Metternich received a warm letter from Franz Joseph; sincere or not, it buoyed Metternich considerably. From mid-August Melanie began to push for a move to Brussels, a city cheaper to live in and closer to continental affairs. They arrived in October, staying overnight in the Hotel Bellevue. With revolution subsiding, Metternich was hopeful they would return to Vienna. Their stay in fact lasted over 18 months while Metternich waited for an opportunity to re-enter Austrian politics. It was a pleasant enough (and cheap) stay, first in the Boulevard de l'Observatoire and later in the Sablon area—filled with visits from politicians, writers, musicians and scientists. For Metternich, however, the tedium and homesickness only increased. In March 1851 Melanie induced him to write to the new political force in Vienna, Prince Schwarzenberg, to ask if he <b>might</b> <b>return</b> if he promised not to interfere in public affairs. In April he received an affirmative reply, authorised by Franz Joseph.|$|E

Many at Milan both within and outside of the club expressed serious reservations about the transfer, with it considered by some players no more than a marketing move.|$|E
25|$|The One Ring possessed {{something}} of a will of its own.
