40|$|Despite common {{claims made}} in policy debates, the {{theoretical}} connection between tort reform and <b>medical</b> malpractice <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> is ambiguous. Simple models suggest reforms such as statutory damages caps reduce premiums.

A number of empirical {{studies have been conducted}} to estimate the impacts of caps on premiums, and several qualitative literature reviews have attempted to draw general conclusions from the literature.

40|$|Recently, {{economists have}} entered the alcohol policy arena by {{pointing}} out that consumption, and also abuse, may be reduced through price increases induced by taxation. Articles have appeared on various aspects ofalcohol abuse, such as drivingunder the influence, youth alcohol abuse, and labor market effects. Many of those articles have the goal of estimating the elasticity of abuse with respect to a tax increase. The notion that abuse can be curbed by taxation has led to a call for increased taxes on alcohol. However, the economic justification for a tax increase is that it meet the social cost-efficiency criterion—that is, the marginal external cost of alcohol abuse should exceed the existing marginal tax rate. Although the studies referred to were wellexecuted in terms ofthe particular focus and econometric technique, very little has been done recently to examine the justifica-tion of a tax increase in terms of social costs. The question of the external cost of alcohol use, as contrasted with abuse, is complex and paradoxical. It is complex because there are two classes of consumers: abusers and moderate drinkers. Although externalities are associated mainly with abusers, both classes pay the tax because it is impossible to differentiate between abusers and moderate drinkers at the point of sale. Hence, a tax on alcohol is an externality for moderate drinkers. The main negative externalities are driving-under-the-influence (DUI) fatalities and injuries, increased <b>medical</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums,</b> and the effect on social security funding of premature death. The paradox of alcohol taxation arises because of the effect on the health and economic welfare of moderate drinkers.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} which {{characteristics and}} beliefs of family physicians determine their decision to provide intrapartum care. DESIGN: Confidential survey questionnaire mailed in spring 1993. SETTING: Alberta and Ontario. SUBJECTS: Random selection of 207 physicians who had graduated from medical school between 1953 and 1990 and {{were thought to be}} in family or general practice. Of 178 eligible physicians, usable replies were received from 104 (58. 4 %). OUTCOME MEASURES: Beliefs (measured on a 7 -point Likert scale) about the relevance of 16 primary factors to the type of obstetric care provided; demographic, training and practice characteristics. RESULTS: The respondents who provided intrapartum care differed from those who did not in their beliefs about the availability of a local hospital suitable for intrapartum care (p < 0. 001), their practice partners' views on the role of family physicians in providing obstetric care (p < 0. 002), their own concept of the role of family physicians in providing obstetric care (p < 0. 001) and women's views on the type of obstetric care they want (p < 0. 002). They also differed, although less significantly, in their beliefs about the adequacy of their obstetric training before entering family practice (p < 0. 04), the expected effects of providing obstetric care on their free time (p < 0. 006), their fear of malpractice litigation (p < 0. 028) and their perceived competence in performing practical obstetric procedures (p < 0. 05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that certain secondary factors were particularly relevant to the respondents' provision of intrapartum care at present. These included the physician's perceived competence at managing postpartum maternal hemorrhage (odds ratio [OR] 48. 90, 90 % confidence interval [CI] 4. 70 to 509), the belief that <b>medical</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> should not be affected by the type of obstetric care provided (OR 3. 55, 90 % CI 1. 67 to 7. 57]) and the number of practice partners who provided intrapartum care (OR 10. 08, 90 % CI 2. 31 to 44. 10). CONCLUSION: Several factors appear to influence family physicians in their decision to provide intrapartum care.

Some of these tort reform laws include caps on monetary penalties for noneconomic harm, such as for plaintiffs' pain and suffering. Congress is considering legislation similar to some states' tort reform laws. GAO examined how health care provider responses to rising malpractice premiums have affected access to health care, whether physicians practice defensive medicine, and how growth in malpractice premiums and claims payments compares across states with varying tort reform laws. Because national data on providers' responses to rising premiums are not reliable, GAO examined the experiences in five states with reported malpractice-related problems (Florida, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, and West Virginia) and four states without reported problems (California, Colorado, Minnesota, and Montana) and analyzed growth in malpractice premiums and claims payments across all states and the District of Columbia. ...|$|R

Including legal fees, insurance costs, and payouts, the cost of all US malpractice suits comes to less than one-half of 1 percent of health-care spending. Other recent research suggests that malpractice pressure makes hospitals more efficient, not less so: [...] "The recent focus by the American Medical Association and physicians about the dramatic increases in <b>medical</b> malpractice <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums,</b> and their suggestion of a cap on non-economic damages, deserves a closer look. According to Baicker and Chandra (2004), increases in premiums are not affected by past or present malpractice payments, but may increase due to other unrelated factors. Chandra, Nundy, and Seabury (2005) find that the rising cost of medical services may explain the bulk of the growth of “compensatory awards”. They also find that the greatest ten percent of the malpractice payments have grown at a smaller pace than the average payment for the years 1991 and 2003. This means that the “medical malpractice crisis” is not necessarily fueled by the growth in malpractice payments. Furthermore, malpractice pressure actually forces our hospitals to be technically more efficient. This implies that existence of the medical malpractice system is beneficial, and its strength should not be diluted by either putting caps on non-economic damages or by decreasing the statute of limitations." ...|$|R

Three states were selected based on type of Exchange implemented, identified as State-Based (SB), State-Partnered (SP), and Federally-Facilitated (FF). Data were collected through public record investigation and health policy expert interviews. A cost-analysis was completed for a total of 10, 427 insurance plans from the three states.

Individual monthly premium costs for embedded plans were found to have minimal differences when compared to the combined monthly premium costs of medical plans and stand-alone dental plans purchased separately (p= 0. 11). Financial implications of cost-sharing designs for embedded plans are limited, restricting consumer protections for the dental patient in comparison to medical coverage.
