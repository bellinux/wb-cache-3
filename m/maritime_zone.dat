Its responsibility was to maintain security at the parts in Penang and the Straits of Johor. On 6 February 2009, the name of Malaysian Marine Police was changed and known as Pasukan Gerakan Marin (English: Marine Operations Force). The rename of the organisation was launched by the Minister of Home Affair, Dato' Seri Syed Hamid Albar at PULAMAR (Abbreviation of Pusat Latihan Marin or Marine Police Training Centre), Tampoi, Johor Bahru and witness by Tan Sri Musa Hassan, the Inspector General of Police and all senior police officers and the media.|$|E
2500|$|Mischief Reef and Second Thomas Shoal {{are both}} low-tide {{elevations}} that generate no maritime zones {{of their own}} [...] {{that none of the}} high-tide features in the Spratly Islands are capable of sustaining human habitation or an economic life of their own within the meaning of those terms in Article 121(3) of the Convention. All of the high-tide features in the Spratly Islands are therefore legally rocks for purposes of Article 121(3) and do not generate entitlements to an exclusive economic zone or continental shelf. There is, accordingly, no possible entitlement by China to any <b>maritime</b> <b>zone</b> in the area of either Mischief Reef or Second Thomas Shoal and no jurisdictional obstacle to the tribunal’s consideration of the Philippines’ Submission No. 5.|$|E
2500|$|There was a {{brief period}} of freedom in the Irish Sea zone for the Vikings of Dublin, with a {{political}} vacuum felt throughout the entire Western <b>Maritime</b> <b>Zone</b> of the North Atlantic Archipelago. Prominent among those who stood to fill the void was Cnut, [...] "whose leadership of the Scandinavian world gave him a unique influence over the western colonies and whose control of their commercial arteries gave an economic edge to political domination". Coinage struck by the king in Dublin, Silkbeard, bearing Cnut's quatrefoil type—in issue c. 1017–25—sporadically replacing the legend with one bearing his own name and styling him as ruler either 'of Dublin' or 'among the Irish' provides evidence of Cnut's influence. Further evidence is the entry of one Sihtric dux in three of Cnut's charters.|$|E

2500|$|The treaty entered {{force on}} 7 July 2011, ending the 44-year-old border dispute. The treaty {{stipulates}} conditions for fishing cooperation, {{providing for the}} retention of the mechanism to jointly regulate fishing in the Barents Sea. The treaty also defines the principles of cooperation in hydrocarbons deposits exploration. A deposit which is crossed by the maritime border may only be exploited as a whole subject to a bilateral agreement. The border treaty is economically significant, as it makes possible to conduct geological surveys and hydrocarbons drilling in the formerly disputed area, which is estimated to contain up to 6.8billion tons of oil and gas. The area is located west of Shtokman, one of the world's largest natural gas fields. According to Anatoly Zolotukhin, vice president of World Petroleum Council, it is [...] "a very prolific area—maybe even more prolific than Shtokman." [...] The Norwegian company Petroleum Geo-Services has been contracted to begin surveying the Norwegian part of the area in 2011. Seismic acquisition in Norway's new <b>maritime</b> <b>zone</b> started on 8 July 2011, and {{is scheduled to be}} completed in summer 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Dominion of England lent the Danes an {{important}} {{link to the}} <b>maritime</b> <b>zone</b> between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland, where Cnut, like his father before him, had a strong interest and wielded much influence among the Norse–Gaels. Cnut's possession of England's dioceses and the continental Diocese of Denmark—with a claim laid upon it by the Holy Roman Empire's Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen—was {{a source of great}} prestige and leverage within the Catholic Church and among the magnates of Christendom (gaining notable concessions such as one on the price of the pallium of his bishops, though they still had to travel to obtain the pallium, {{as well as on the}} tolls his people had to pay on the way to Rome). After his 1026 victory against Norway and Sweden, and on his way back from Rome where he attended the coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor, Cnut, in a letter written for the benefit of his subjects deemed himself [...] "King of all England and Denmark and the Norwegians and of some of the Swedes". The Anglo-Saxon kings used the title [...] "king of the English". Cnut was ealles Engla landes cyning—"king of all England". [...] Medieval historian Norman Cantor called him [...] "the most effective king in Anglo-Saxon history".|$|E

40|$|The {{legal status}} of Svalbard and its {{competence}} to generate <b>maritime</b> <b>zones</b> has long been disputed. Article 1 of the Svalbard Treaty grants Norway sovereignty over the Archipelago and its territorial waters and Norway holds that the Archipelago constitutes {{a part of the}} natural prolongation of the mainland continental shelf and that the continental shelf therefore is subject to Norwegian legislation. This thesis aims at investigating whether Svalbard can generate <b>maritime</b> <b>zones</b> and is indicative towards the conclusion that there is a discrepancy between state policy and state practice of recent years. This may indicate that there is a change in the Norwegian position. The thesis further raises the question on the consequences of Svalbard generating <b>maritime</b> <b>zones</b> and assumes consequently that the Svalbard Treaty and its regulatory framework applies to the continental shelf of Svalbard. The legal implications of the application of the Svalbard Treaty to activities related to the exploitation of non-living resources on the continental shelf is then discussed {{on the basis of the}} previous chapters concluding that Norway has the competence to apply Norwegian law to the extent it does not contravene with the non-discriminatory principle of the Svalbard Treaty...|$|R
