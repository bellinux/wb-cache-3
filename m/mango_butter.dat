50|$|Fractionation is {{also used}} for culinary purposes, as coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil are {{fractionated}} to produce oils of different viscosities, {{that may be used}} for different purposes. These oils typically use fractional crystallization (separation by solubility at temperatures) for the separation process instead of distillation. Mango oil is an oil fraction obtained during the processing of <b>mango</b> <b>butter.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Mango</b> <b>butter</b> was {{explored}} as a functional, {{natural supplement}} and active skin ingredient in skin care formulations. A foot care cream was developed with <b>mango</b> <b>butter</b> to evaluate its medicinal value and protective function in skin repair. Qualitative comparison and clinical {{case studies of}} the product were carried out. Wound healing potential of foot care cream was investigated on the rat excision and incision wound models. Results of the clinical studies demonstrated complete repair of worn and cracked skin in all the human volunteers. Furthermore, foot care cream exhibited significant healing response in both the wound models. The project work could be concluded as establishment of high potential for <b>mango</b> <b>butter</b> to yield excellent emolliency for better skin protection. Improving the product features and medicinal functionality further validate <b>mango</b> <b>butter</b> as a specialty excipient in development of cosmeceuticals and has an immense value for its commercialization...|$|E

30|$|Consumption and {{industrial}} exploitation of mango generate significant waste, mainly {{made of the}} peels and the seed kernel of the fruit, which account for 7 % to 22 % {{of the weight of}} the whole fruit [1]. In Cameroon, a rapid estimation of this waste based on the national mango production, evaluated to 539, 000  t in 2012 [2], showed that nearly 38, 500 to 121, 000  t of mango waste are produced. Environmental, hygienic, and public health problems result in unorganized management of this waste [3, 4]. Valorization of mango seed kernels through production of butter and biofunctional flour are the main solutions technologically proposed, since different studies have shown that mango seed kernels contain various phenolic compounds. <b>Mango</b> seed kernel <b>butter</b> is used in cosmetics for its non-saponifiable matter content and its antioxidant activity potential [5 - 7]. The mango seed kernel flour displays interesting antioxidant and antibacterial properties [8 - 13]. These properties have also been found in mango peels [3]. Valorizing this biowaste as a potential source of non-conventional oil and natural antioxidants represents an opportunity to improve mango producer's income, particularly in regions where poverty is current. In this respect, drying of the seed kernels {{is one of the main}} technological steps both for efficient extraction of the functional components and for inactivation of enzymatic degradation of the raw material. Drying of mango seed kernels before extraction contributes then to stabilize the product and to increase the yield of extraction. Since the temperature and the time of drying may affect the activity and the stability of bioactive compounds, due to chemical and enzymatic degradation, low evaporation, and/or thermal degradation, a badly carried out drying can lead to physicochemical reactions which can lead to losses of the textural and nutritional values [14] and thus bring damage in the quality of the product. Optimizing the drying of seed kernels would then enable to make sure that the product obtained has desired quality.|$|R
40|$|Carabao mangoes {{are among}} the highly {{produced}} fruit crops in the Philippines. The processing and consumption of carabao mangoes leave {{a significant amount of}} waste seeds. Mango kernel butter extracted from waste seed kernels is a potential additive to cosmetic products or as a cocoa butter substitute. This study determined the pretreatment conditions that produce optimum yield prior to the mechanical extraction of the crude butter. Moreover, this study provided a general sensory evaluation of the finished product. Microwave power (160, 500, and 850 W), microwave exposure time (2. 0, 3. 5, and 5. 0 min), and size levels (1. 5, 3. 0, and 4. 5 mm) were tested for their effects on the yield of the mechanically extracted crude butter in wet basis percentage. The optimization procedures resulted to optimum pretreatment conditions of 160 W, 4. 25 min, and 1. 5 mm. Size level was the most significant factor in the crude butter yield. Sensory evaluation of the crude butter extracted at optimum pretreatment conditions through acceptance test by a test panel resulted to below neutral scores in visual appearance and odor, and above neutral score in texture, indicating the potential of <b>mango</b> <b>butter</b> as a good substitute to cocoa butter in cosmetic products...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{encapsulation}} of vegetable organogels in alginate microparticles (MPs). <b>Mango</b> <b>butter</b> (MB) and cocoa butter (CB) are natural organogels which are {{being used in the}} preparation of pharmaceutical formulations. In addition to these, mustard oil (MO) was used as the control. The thermal stability of MB and CB can be enhanced by encapsulating them and can be used in oral drug delivery formulations. Double emulsification method was followed for the preparation of MPs. By this method, spherical MPs were synthesized and the sphericity was confirmed by doing light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The size range of MPs was 107 ± 53 μm, 79 ± 43 μm and 112 ± 78 μm for MPs encapsulating MO, MB and CB, respectively. The melting endotherms of MPs with MB and CB were in exact match with the melting points of MB and CB. This confirmed the existence of MB and CB within the MPs. Encapsulation MB and CB has caused a significant change in the amorphousity of the MPs, which subsequently affected their drug release pattern. The drug release kinetics suggested that the release pattern followed the non-Fickian kinetics. The MPs were found to be hemocompatible in nature and have shown good mucoadhesive and swelling properties. Based on the preliminary results, it was suggested that the vegetable organogels can be encapsulated in alginate microparticles and used as drug delivery vehicles...|$|E
40|$|Over the years, biopolymeric microparticles {{have been}} {{associated}} with the leaching of the internal phase. The present work was aimed at developing a new strategy in negotiating the problem of leaching from the microparticles. We hypothesized that gelation of the internal phase as organogels (core) and their encapsulation within the alginate microparticles may prevent leaching. Organogels were prepared using natural fatty acyl sources and synthetic source. Natural sources include vegetable fats (cocoa butter, <b>mango</b> <b>butter),</b> animal fat (lanolin) and fatty acid having both plant and animal origin (stearic acid), whereas, synthetic source include the mixture of Span 80 and Tween 80. Prior to encapsulation, the physicochemical, thermal and mechanical properties of the organogels were characterized in depth. The gelation mechanism and crystallization phenomenon during the formation of vegetable fat and stearic acid based organogels were critically evaluated. The predicted gelation mechanism in vegetable fat based organogels is instantaneous nucleation coupled with one or two dimensional growth of the fat crystals. On the other hand, stearate molecules followed heterogeneous nucleation coupled with one-dimensional growth during the formation of stearate organogels. The aforementioned organogels were encapsulated within the alginate microparticles by ionotropic gelation method. Microscopic, XRD and DSC studies confirmed the successful encapsulation of organogels as the core material of the developed microparticles. The organogel encapsulated microparticles prevented the leaching of the internal phase and improved the drug encapsulation efficiency. Presence of semi-solid organogels as the core material facilitated the controlled release of the drugs (model drugs: metronidazole and ciprofloxacin in stearate formulations) from the microparticles. The developed formulations showed good antimicrobial properties against Escherichia coli. The microparticles were found to be biocompatible and mucoadhesive in nature when checked against mammalian L 929 fibroblast cells and goat’s small intestine, respectively. Based on the results, it was concluded that the developed formulations (organogels and microparticles) may be used as the controlled drug delivery vehicles for in vivo applications...|$|E
