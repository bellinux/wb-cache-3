Its main adornment is a frieze that crowns calligraphy, the latter surmounted by a line of pointed openwork merlons, features an inscription in flowery kufic character carved on the background of interlacing plants. Carefully executed in relief, it represents one of the most beautiful epigraphic bands of Islamic art.|$|E

25|$|In early February, the {{government}} and the FARC once again found themselves at odds, {{on the issue of the}} plebiscite. The FARC, by communiqué, argued that the plebiscite contravened the general agreement (from August 2012). In response, President Santos tweeted that the final agreement in Havana would be submitted to plebiscite, whether the FARC liked it or not. In late February, the FARC's 'armed proselytism' during a 'political pedagogy' event (attended by Iván Marquez and other negotiators) in La Guajira stirred significant controversy. Since 2015, the FARC's negotiators had been authorized by {{the government}} to travel to Colombia to organize 'political pedagogy' events with their troops only, and till then all such activities had occurred without major problems. However, the presence of armed men <b>mingling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> civilian population during this particular event in La Guajira rekindled fears about the use of weapons by the guerrilla during political events. President Santos notified the guerrilla that 'political pedagogy' events were suspended until further notice and issued an ultimatum that either a final agreement is signed on March 23 or it would be understood that the FARC are not ready for peace. Semana considered the incident as a major blow to confidence and trust in the peace process, which came at a critical moment.|$|E
25|$|Although GM R (as it {{is known}} in colloquial shorthand) began as an {{organization}} largely built around one man (Kettering), it eventually evolved into a more modern organization whose path is shaped by individuals but not dominated entirely by any of them. World War II {{was a turning point}} wherein military affairs, after <b>mingling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> technologies of applied science for some 80 years, first started to become fundamentally reinvented by them. Civilian life, too, changed in this direction. By the 1950s, corporations such as GM and many others were facing a new era of R, different from earlier ones. Less about genius inventors and individual inventions, and more about organizational progress and integrated systems, it raised new questions about where the capital for R would come from in an era of limitless demand for R (although not necessarily for production). Alfred Sloan, longtime CEO of GM (1920s to 1960s), discussed in his memoir (also considered a seminal management treatise) the relationships between government, academia, and private industry in the areas of basic science and applied science, in light of this new era. The views he laid out reflected (and influenced) wide consensus on these relationships that persists largely to today.|$|E

Six weeks of time aboard the ship amounts to roughly nine years experienced by those on Earth. Corday resists <b>mingling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> culture aboard the starship, but when he returns home after travels with the Hound of Heaven he finds that his fiancee has aged and has trouble with her memory.

When Santa Anna saw {{that the bulk of}} his army was massed against the north wall, he feared a rout; [...] "panicked", he sent the reserves into the same area. The Mexican soldiers closest to the north wall realized that the makeshift wall contained many gaps and toeholds. One of the first to scale the 12-foot (3.7 m) wall was General Juan Amador; at his challenge, his men began swarming up the wall. Amador opened the postern in the north wall, allowing Mexican soldiers to pour into the complex. Others climbed through gun ports in the west wall, which had few defenders. As the Texian defenders abandoned the north wall and the northern end of the west wall, Texian gunners {{at the south end of}} the mission turned their cannon towards the north and fired into the advancing Mexican soldiers. This left the south end of the mission unprotected; within minutes Mexican soldiers had climbed the walls and killed the gunners, gaining control of the Alamo's 18-pounder cannon. By this time Romero's men had taken the east wall of the compound and were pouring in through the cattle pen.|$|E

While the attempts by the Cocoon fal'Cie to revive him in Final Fantasy XIII failed, Bhunivelze awakens in the aftermath of Final Fantasy XIII-2 when Granpulse is being transformed into Nova Chrysalia from its <b>mingling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Unseen Realm. Though Bhunivelze attempts to stop corruption, he gradually accepts that the Nova Chrysalia is beyond saving and makes Lightning the savior to saves the souls of those still alive in preparation for the birth of a new world. His wish is to purge humanity of their memories by destroying the dead, leaving them free of all burdens and knowing only happiness in the new world. While having the Order of Salvation carry out his plans for humanity, he makes Hope his host and conditions Lightning to become the replacement for Etro. When Lightning chooses to rebel and thwarts the Order's mission, allowing the souls of the dead to mingle with the living, Bhunivelze decides to destroy all souls along with his new world with the intent to create his own version of humanity that are practically extensions of himself. Lightning fights Bhunivelze, wounding him and freeing Hope's soul before uniting with the souls of humanity to defeat him. After his defeat, Lightning states that even if he survived, humanity would defeat him once again.|$|E

After Hilson assures Jammal that she can handle it, the song begins and Hilson are seen wearing outfits of black bikinis as they dance seductively to the song's chorus and verse. Meanwhile, Hilson and her crew are back in the room preparing themselves with scenes of Hilson grinding against a large vault door. As the song moves to the pre-chorus, Hilson and her crew are shown at a party, <b>mingling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> male guests and handing them drinks. As Ross' verse begins, he, Short and da Don are shown at the party as Hilson's crew grind themselves around them and Hilson kisses Short's head.

Short (who {{has turned out to be}} Hilson's target) is able to respond almost immediately by having his men pull out their guns. Seeing they are evenly matched, Short agrees to let Hilson take him into custody, with Hilson removing her top and locking them both in handcuffs. The two walk upstairs, where Short pushes Hilson against the wall and they kiss on the stairway. The video ends with Short following Hilson upstairs while the words [...] "To be continued..."

2500|$|Over time, Cuman culture exerted an {{influence}} on the Ceangăi/Hungarian Csangos and Romanian culture in Moldavia, due to the Hungarians in Moldavia socializing and <b>mingling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Cumans between the 14th and 15th centuries. Hakan Aydemir, a Turkic linguist, states that the 'ir' of the Ceangăi/Csangos and Székelys dialect, which means 'carve', 'notch', {{as well as the}} words 'urk/uruk' (meaning 'lasso', 'noose'), 'dszepu (meaning 'wool') and 'korhany' (meaning 'small mountain', 'hill') are of Cuman-Kipchak origin. Additionally, the Cumans could have also had some connection with Székelys runes. Several Romanian as well as Hungarian academics believe that a significant Cuman population lived in Moldavia in the 15th century; these Cumans later assimilated into the Romanian population. People in Hungary with the surname Palóc are descended from the Cumans (and possibly Kabars and Pechenegs)– Palóc origintates from the Slavic word Polovets/Polovtsy. Although the Palócs were similar to the Hungarians in origins and culture, they were considered distinct groups by the Turks.
