[...] The renovated space {{featured}} {{two levels of}} seating for up to 400 people (600 standing), an expanded <b>multi-channel</b> <b>sound</b> <b>system,</b> projection screen for film and multi-media events, state-of-the-art lighting system, modular stage, and a specially designed floor to accommodate dance. A review of the new venue in The New York Times said, [...] "the new space has a cool allure, with Art Deco details refurbished in elegant gray and silver, and balconies that surround the spacious floor seating on three sides." [...] Roulette celebrated the opening with a four-evening opening series, featuring Lou Reed, Laurie Anderson, John Zorn, Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho and 2016 Pulitzer Prize-winner Henry Threadgill.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to provide a solution for listening to the acoustics of Digital Waveguide Mesh (DWM) modelled virtual acoustic spaces. The DWM is a numerical simulation technique that has shown to be appropriate for modelling the propogation of sound through air. Recent work has explored methods for spatially capturing a soundfield within a virtual acoustic space using spatially distributed receivers based on sound intensity probe theory. This technique is now extended to facilitate spatial encoding using second-order spherical harmonics. This is achieved through an array of pressure sensitive receivers arranged around a central reference point, with appropriate processing applied to obtain the second-order harmonic signals associated with Ambisonic encoding/decoding. The processed signals are tested using novel techniques in order to objectively assess their integrity for reproducing a faithful impression of the virtual soundfield over a <b>multi-channel</b> <b>sound</b> <b>system.</b> 1...|$|E

40|$|When one {{listens to}} music at home, one {{would like to}} have an {{acoustic}} impression close to that of being in the concert hall. Until recently this meant elaborate <b>multi-channelled</b> <b>sound</b> <b>systems</b> with 5 or more speakers. But head-related stereophony achieves the surround-sound effect in living rooms with only two loudspeakers. By virtue of their slight directivity as well as an electronic filter the limitations previously common to two-speaker systems can be overcome and this holds for any arbitrary two-channel recording. The book also investigates the question of how a wide and diffuse sound image can arise in concert halls and shows that the quality of concert halls decisively depends on diffuse sound images arising in the onset of reverberation. For this purpose a strong onset of reverberation is modified in an anechoic chamber by electroacoustic means.

40|$|Audio Engineers are {{required}} to design and deploy large <b>multi-channel</b> <b>sound</b> <b>systems</b> which meet a set of requirements and use networking technologies such as Firewire and Ethernet AVB. Bandwidth utilisation and parameter groupings are among the factors which {{need to be considered}} in these designs. An implementation of an extensible, generic simulation framework would allow audio engineers to easily compare protocols and networking technologies and get near real time responses with regards to bandwidth utilisation. Our hypothesis is that an application-level capability can be developed which uses a network simulation framework to enable this process and enhances the audio engineer’s experience of designing and configuring a network. This thesis presents a new, extensible simulation framework which can be utilised to simulate professional audio networks. This framework is utilised to develop an application - AudioNetSim - based on the requirements of an audio engineer. The thesis describes the AudioNetSim models and implementations for Ethernet AVB, Firewire and the AES- 64 control protocol. AudioNetSim enables bandwidth usage determination for any network configuration and connection scenario and is used to compare Firewire and Ethernet AVB bandwidth utilisation.

5000|$|As {{one of the}} few Institute-wide gatherings on {{a weekly}} basis over the years, LSC movie {{screenings}} have developed and retained a few quirky traditions which sometimes befuddle outsiders. One unspoken tradition relates to the 1950s style introductory film clips that announce [...] "coming attractions" [...] movie trailers. When stereophonic sound was a new development in movies, the movie trailers would be preceded by a clip announcing, [...] "Coming Next Week", followed by [...] "In Stereo". For whatever reason, MIT audiences would spontaneously read the announcements aloud, in unison. This eventually became such an ingrained habit that, even though LSC discontinued screening the [...] "stereo" [...] announcements, the audience would intone the (now unseen) words.

Post-war stereo sound in theaters initially came from separate magnetic film reproducers synchronised to the picture, but in the 1950s systems using magnetic stripes on the film itself came into use. Cinemascope used four such tracks (left, center, right and surround), and the subsequent Todd-AO 70mm system used six (left, left-center, center, right-center and right, plus a single surround channel). Unfortunately these magnetic systems were not only very expensive, but were also unreliable and so were little used, the industry preferring {{to stay with the}} tried, tested (and cheap) mono optical track.|$|R
40|$|WESTPRAC VII 2000 : the 7 th West Pacific Regional Acoustics Conference, October 3 - 5, 2000, Kumamoto, Japan. In {{order to}} realize the <b>multi-channel</b> <b>sound</b> field {{reproduction}} <b>system,</b> it is indispensable to design inverse filters that remove the effect of room transfer functions. The design method in the frequency domain based on the least-norm-solution (LNS) is less memory and less calculation than the design method in the time domain. However, the LNS method cannot guarantee the causality and stability of the filters. In this paper, a design method of a time domain inverse filter using iterative processing in the frequency domain for <b>multi-channel</b> <b>sound</b> field reproduction is proposed, and the numerical analysis result is described. The proposed method can decrease the squared error for every sensor by 3 - 12 dB. Furthermore, the reproduced sound by this method attains over 13 dB improvement in the segmental SNR compared with one designed by the LNS method for real environment impulse responses...|$|R
40|$|The {{available}} {{technologies for}} {{the presentation of}} audiovisual scenes to large audiences show different degrees of maturity.

If a channel is missing, a feature called Channel Phantoming allows the best use of the speakers that are there, by redirecting the sound of the missing channels through these speakers.

5000|$|There {{had been}} {{experiments}} with <b>multi-channel</b> <b>sound</b> {{for many years}} [...] - [...] usually for special musical or cultural events [...] - [...] but the first commercial application of the concept came in the early 1970s {{with the introduction of}} Quadraphonic sound. This spin-off development from multitrack recording used four tracks (instead of the two used in stereo) and four speakers to create a 360-degree audio field around the listener. Following the release of the first consumer 4-channel hi-fi systems, a number of popular albums were released in one of the competing four-channel formats; among the best known are Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells and Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon. Quadraphonic sound was not a commercial success, partly because of competing and somewhat incompatible four-channel <b>sound</b> <b>systems</b> (e.g., CBS, JVC, Dynaco and others all had systems) and generally poor quality, even when played as intended on the correct equipment, of the released music.
