25|$|Although Fischer was {{in favour}} of {{stationing}} German troops in Afghanistan, he advised chancellor Schröder not to join the war in Iraq. Fischer famously confronted United States Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld at the 39th <b>Munich</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Conference</b> in 2003 on the secretary's purported evidence for Iraq's possession {{of weapons of mass}} destruction ("Excuse me, I am not convinced").|$|E
25|$|At the <b>Munich</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Conference</b> in February 2011, Ayalon, {{emphasizing}} Germany’s {{crucial part}} in crushing the Iranian threat, stated: “The Iranian regime today {{is just as}} dangerous {{to the world as}} Hitler was in the 1930s. We don't have the luxury of waiting for the results of the sanctions on Iran; we must immediately put heavy pressure on Iran until it cracks. Germany, as the strongest country in the European Union, must provide an answer {{to the needs of the}} European states that get oil from Iran, so that they will no longer be dependent on Iranian oil.” He also made an appeal to Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights Navanethem Pillay to cancel her plans to visit Iran, stating that the visit would legitimize a regime that “maliciously violates human rights, executes its citizens and openly calls for genocide”.|$|E

2500|$|France: The 2016 <b>Munich</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Conference</b> put the {{spotlight}} on severely strained Franco-German relations when Prime Minister Manuel Valls publicly rejected German Chancellor Angela Merkel's permanent quota-based system for the distribution of refugees across Europe as [...] "unsustainable in the long run" [...] and stated: [...] "France has agreed to take in 30,000 refugees. As far as these 30,000 are concerned, our doors remain open. But not more,".|$|E

Eleven years ago, that region was in flames, characterized by ethnic cleansing and widespread violence. For {{the first time the}} region is today poised to move forward, with final status for Kosovo and transitioning continuing responsibilities there to increasing European control – at long last closing the door on the region's painful past," [...] stated McCain at the <b>Munich</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Conference</b> in February 2008. During the crisis in the Serbian breakaway province of Kosovo in 1999, McCain urged President Clinton to use all necessary force.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 February 2013, {{speaking}} at the <b>Munich</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Conference,</b> U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden said that the Obama Administration [...] "would be prepared to meet bilaterally with the Iranian leadership. We would not make it a secret that we were doing that. We would let our partners know if that occasion presented itself. That offer stands, {{but it must be}} real and tangible, and {{there has to be an}} agenda that they’re prepared to speak to. We are not just prepared to do it for the exercise." [...] A few days later Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected the offer and added ambiguously: [...] "The U.S. policies in the Middle East have failed and the Americans are in need of a winning hand. That is bringing Iran to the negotiating table." [...] On 4 February the Italian news-wire [...] "Agenzia Nova", citing [...] "sources in Teheran," [...] reported that [...] "from the beginning of the year Ali Larijani, Speaker of the (Iranian) Parliament, secretly traveled twice to the United States" [...] to launch direct negotiations with the Obama Administration. The Italian Agency explained that U.S. diplomacy was waiting for the Presidential election in Iran, that most probably will see a dramatic change in Iranian approach. It was reported on 17 June Iran’s newly elected president Hassan Rohani had expressed readiness for bilateral talks with Washington, with conditions.|$|E
