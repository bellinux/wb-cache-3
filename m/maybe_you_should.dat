25|$|BNL's second album, <b>Maybe</b> <b>You</b> <b>Should</b> Drive, {{released}} in 1994, fared considerably less {{well with the}} Canadian public. They tried touring the United States, but the tour was a failure and ended up losing money despite an appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Before the next release Andy Creeggan {{decided to leave the}} band. He had become disillusioned with the direction of the band, and was not comfortable with the fame the group had attained. According to Page, he had considered leaving as early as the rehearsals for the Drive album; The rest of the band convinced him to stay to record that album, and for the subsequent touring. In addition, Creeggan wanted to attend McGill University to study music further. Tyler Stewart has also suggested that Creeggan had never fully accepted his replacement by Stewart as percussionist. Andy Creeggan's departure came during a time in which members of the band were starting to become sick of each other, with Page and Robertson rarely speaking to one another. Stewart cites the departure as worsening the situation. Page also began struggling with both alcohol abuse and depression. In an attempt to correct the band's downward slide, they signed with Terry McBride and Nettwerk as their management.|$|E

I said, [...] "Mr. Mauriac," [...] we called him Maître, [...] "ten years or so ago, I have seen children, {{hundreds}} of Jewish children, who suffered more than Jesus did on his cross and we do not speak about it." [...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he sat down in his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> talk about it." ...|$|E

[...] It just makes me believe in God and my journey. My cross to bear was to go through these heartbreaks and write these songs and help people." [...] The singer also told Ryan Seacrest that while writing the songs for the album during her personal struggles {{with the end of}} her marriage, she felt the process was therapeutic. She commented: [...] "The record company was like, 'Listen, we really think your record is too personal and {{no one is going to}} relate to this record and <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> just put it out as an artistic body of work—don't even think about radio'." [...] She described the sensation of hearing this was like being punched in the stomach.|$|E
5000|$|Tony Sclafani of PopMatters {{rated the}} album an {{eight out of}} ten, commenting [...] "Heroes & Thieves isn’t a perfect album and {{sometimes}} gets too idiosyncratic and precious for its own good. It’s already spawned its share of detractors, specifically reviewers who question whether Carlton has the vocal goods to pull {{off some of the}} more complicated numbers. I think her imperfect singing keeps her sounding human and give her props for not messing with a pitch correction program. And if you feel the same, well, <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> too <b>should</b> start thinking <b>you</b> might have a problem with ‘Nessa addiction. See you at the next ‘Nessaholics meeting." ...|$|R

[...] "Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things like that are coming out of people's mouths. It made me feel like I wasn't even in the room." [...] In April 2013, in {{a cover story}} for GQ magazine, Mars confessed that he changed his surname because people in the music industry took him as another Latino artist, and even tried to convince him to sing in Spanish saying: [...] "Your last name's Hernandez, <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> do the Latin music, this Spanish music... Enrique [...] is so hot right now”. Nevertheless, Mars used his childhood nickname Bruno and changed his surname to Mars, in an effort to [...] "avoid being stereotyped".|$|E
500|$|On December 10, 2006 the Merriam-Webster Dictionary {{announced}} that [...] "truthiness" [...] {{was selected as}} its 2006 Word of the Year on Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year, based on a reader poll, by a 5–1 margin over the second-place word google. [...] "We're {{at a point where}} what constitutes truth is a question on a lot of people's minds, and truth has become up for grabs", said Merriam-Webster president John Morse. Truthiness' is a playful way for us to think about a very important issue." [...] However, despite winning Word of the Year, the word does not appear in the 2006 edition of the Merriam-Webster English Dictionary. In response to this omission, during [...] "The Wørd" [...] segment on December 12, 2006 Colbert issued a new page 1344 for the tenth edition of the Merriam Webster dictionary that featured [...] "truthiness". To make room for the definition of [...] "truthiness", including a portrait of Colbert, the definition for the word [...] "try" [...] was removed with Colbert stating [...] "Sorry, try. <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have tried harder." [...] He also sarcastically told viewers to [...] "not" [...] download the new page and [...] "not" [...] glue it in the new dictionary in libraries and schools.|$|E
500|$|Part of the {{attraction}} for the writers {{is that they}} are able to break the rules and include violence that would not make a regular episode. In some cases, the writers will have an idea that is too violent and far-fetched or too short for a normal episode, but {{can be used as a}} segment in the seasonal special. Several of the writers, former executive producer David Mirkin among them, believe that the episodes should be scary and not just funny. [...] "Treehouse of Horror V" [...] has been described by Mirkin as being one of [...] "the most intense, disturbing Halloween show ever" [...] as it was filled with violence and gore in response to new censorship rules. Earlier [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] episodes began with Marge issuing a disclaimer that [...] "if you have sensitive children, <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> tuck them into bed early tonight instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow." [...] However, these episodes seem mild compared to the carnage that followed in later episodes, according to Jean, who calls it [...] "a societal thing". [...] He points out that his 10-year-old daughter loves films like Coraline, and that, [...] " [...] the age of scary stories [...] appropriateness has gotten lower." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Keedy was {{frequently}} chosen over Kerrigan in the County Championship for 2011, Kerrigan cited Keedy's advice as being useful, saying [...] "always {{coming down to}} you if he thinks you're doing something you shouldn't be doing or <b>maybe</b> what <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be doing". In the penultimate County Championship match of the season Kerrigan took career-best innings figures of 9/51 to take Lancashire to a 222-run win over Hampshire. The final wicket of the match was claimed with just four minutes of play left and was greeted with a mini pitch invasion as the victory kept Lancashire in contention for the title. Kerrigan recorded the best bowling figures for Lancashire since Roy Tattersall's 9/40 in 1953. In September, in the last match of the season Lancashire won the County Championship {{for the first time}} since they shared the title in 1950. Kerrigan contributed 24 wickets from the four Championship matches he played that season, placing him sixth on Lanashire's list of leading wicket-takers for the competition.|$|R

2500|$|Barenaked Ladies {{has often}} {{attempted}} to use {{new technologies to}} promote themselves and their music. They were among the early adopters of computers for promotion when they released an [...] "Interactive Press Kit" [...] on 3.5-inch floppy disk for <b>Maybe</b> <b>You</b> <b>Should</b> Drive in 1994, which earned them a MuchMusic Video Award. They used their website to allow fans to choose between two songs ("Be My Yoko Ono" [...] and [...] "Alternative Girlfriend") for inclusion on their greatest hits CD Disc One (though polling was nearly tied and both songs were included).|$|E

[...] Daily Nexus columnist Nina Love Anthony views the practice of facials in a non-threatening light, feeling that it adds variety to the sexual experience. In one of her weekly articles she wrote [...] "But let's give credit where credit is due: The money shot, by itself, is great {{for a number of}} reasons. Blowing it on someone's face is like a change-up pitch – if you've been throwing the heat for a while, <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> consider hooking the curve ball."

2500|$|The band {{released}} Born on a Pirate Ship as {{a quartet}} in 1996. The album received two large boosts from {{the inclusion of}} the song [...] "Shoe Box" [...] on the Friends soundtrack and from the Jason Priestley-directed video for [...] "The Old Apartment", which got notable American airplay and while the album had stronger sales than <b>Maybe</b> <b>You</b> <b>Should</b> Drive, the album still did not match the success of [...] "Gordon". The Ladies appeared as the guest band on an episode of Beverly Hills, 90210 ("Spring Breakdown" [...] original air date: April 2, 1997), immediately preceding their 1997 tour; they performed [...] "The Old Apartment," [...] "Life, In A Nutshell," [...] and [...] "Brian Wilson" [...] at the Peach Pit After Dark night club. Tyler Stewart invited his friend Kevin Hearn to replace Andy Creeggan as keyboardist for the tour; Hearn ultimately joined the band full-time. The band also had a cameo in the Canadian Film [...] "The Wrong Guy" [...] with Dave Foley in 1997. They performed the song [...] "Gangster Girl" [...] as police officers in an alley on their break.|$|E

6000|$|Be {{sure that}} you give the poor the aid they most need, though it be your example which leaves them far behind. If you give money, spend {{yourself}} with it, and do not merely abandon it to them. We make curious mistakes sometimes. Often the poor man is not so cold and hungry as he is dirty and ragged and gross. It is partly his taste, and not merely his misfortune. If you give him money, he will perhaps buy more rags with it. I was wont to pity the clumsy Irish laborers who cut ice on the pond, in such mean and ragged clothes, while I shivered in my more tidy and somewhat more fashionable garments, till, one bitter cold day, one who had slipped into the water {{came to my house}} to warm him, and I saw him strip off three pairs of pants and two pairs of stockings ere he got down to the skin, though they were dirty and ragged enough, it is true, and that he could afford to refuse the extra garments which I offered him, he had so many intra ones. This ducking was the very thing he needed. Then I began to pity myself, and I saw {{that it would be a}} greater charity to bestow on me a flannel shirt than a whole slop-shop on him. There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root, and it may be that he who bestows the largest amount of time and money on the needy is doing the most by his mode of life to produce that misery which he strives in vain to relieve. It is the pious slave-breeder devoting the proceeds of every tenth slave to buy a Sunday's liberty for the rest. Some show their kindness to the poor by employing them in their kitchens. Would they not be kinder if they employed themselves there? You boast of spending a tenth part of your income in charity; <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> spend the nine tenths so, and done with it. Society recovers only a tenth part of the property then. Is this owing to the generosity of him in whose possession it is found, or to the remissness of the officers of justice? ...|$|E
