5|$|A {{superphylum}} – TACK – {{has been}} proposed that includes the Thaumarchaeota, Aigarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, and Korarchaeota.

5|$|Many {{psychological}} mechanisms {{have been}} implicated {{in the development and}} maintenance of schizophrenia. Cognitive biases have been identified in those with the diagnosis or those at risk, especially when under stress or in confusing situations. Some cognitive features may reflect global neurocognitive deficits such as memory loss, while others <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to particular issues and experiences.|$|E
5|$|Other cell-death {{mechanisms}} include proteasomal and lysosomal system dysfunction {{and reduced}} mitochondrial activity. Iron accumulation in the substantia nigra is typically observed {{in conjunction with}} the protein inclusions. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to oxidative stress, protein aggregation and neuronal death, but the mechanisms are not fully understood.|$|E
5|$|Pentastomida is {{an enigmatic}} group of parasites that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to maxillopod crustaceans. One species, Porocephalus crotali, is {{known from the}} marsh rice rat. It infects various mammals in the southeastern United States, which serve as {{intermediate}} hosts; snakes which eat those mammals are the definitive hosts.|$|E

5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{begins its}} breeding season {{later in the}} year than any other finch and later than any other native North American bird, besides occasionally the sedge wren. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to the abundance of seeds in the late summer months, as seeds represent the majority of their diet.|$|E
5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. The question {{is only one of}} limits: how far to go. When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} is widely {{regarded}} as sexually monomorphic, males have been suggested to grow more quickly, and in some naturally occurring strains, males are noted to possess dark blotches on the base of their dorsal fins. The species reaches sexual maturity around one year of age, and continues to reproduce for 9–10 years. Frequency and timing of spawning <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to the occurrence of rain. A. ocellatus fish are biparental substrate spawners, though detailed information regarding their reproduction in the wild is scarce.|$|E

5|$|Cannabis {{can be a}} {{contributory}} {{factor in}} schizophrenia, potentially causing the disease in those who are already at risk. The increased risk may require the presence of certain genes within an individual or <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to preexisting psychopathology. Early exposure is strongly {{associated with an increased}} risk. The size of the increased risk is not clear, but appears to be in the range of two to three times greater for psychosis. Higher dosage and greater frequency of use are indicators of increased risk of chronic psychoses.|$|E
5|$|Improvement of {{neurological}} function usually occurs {{for two or}} {{more years}} after the trauma. For many years {{it was believed that}} recovery was fastest during the first six months, but {{there is no evidence to}} support this. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to services commonly being withdrawn after this period, rather than any physiological limitation to further progress. Children recover better in the immediate time frame and improve for longer periods.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, several theorists {{generalized}} Montonen–Olive duality to the S-duality relationship, which connects different string theories. Ashoke Sen studied S-duality in {{the context}} of heterotic strings in four dimensions. Chris Hull and Paul Townsend showed that type IIB string theory with a large coupling constant is equivalent via S-duality to the same theory with small coupling constant. Theorists also found that different string theories <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> by T-duality. This duality implies that strings propagating on completely different spacetime geometries may be physically equivalent.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about sivaladapid ecology. Gingerich and Sahni {{suggested}} that Indraloris was probably arboreal and {{that it may have}} been more frugivorous (eating fruit) than Sivaladapis, which they interpreted as a folivore (leaf-eater). Flynn and Morgan interpreted I.kamlialensis as a mixed feeder. The Late Miocene extinction of Indian sivaladapids <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to a decline in forest cover in Asia and to competition by immigrating colobine monkeys.|$|E
5|$|The English {{proper name}} Sun {{developed}} from Old English sunne and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to south. Cognates to English sun appear in other Germanic languages, including Old Frisian sunne, sonne, Old Saxon sunna, Middle Dutch sonne, modern Dutch zon, Old High German sunna, modern German Sonne, Old Norse sunna, and Gothic sunnō. All Germanic terms for the Sun stem from Proto-Germanic *sunnōn.|$|E
5|$|The Spinozistic {{conception}} of a conatus was a historical precursor to modern theories of autopoiesis in biological systems. In systems theory and the sciences in general, {{the concept of a}} conatus <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to the phenomenon of emergence, whereby complex systems may spontaneously form from multiple simpler structures. The self-regulating and self-maintaining properties of biological and even social systems may thus be considered modern versions of Spinoza's conatus principle; however, the scope of the idea is definitely narrower today without the religious implications of the earlier variety.|$|E

5|$|The {{distribution}} of subtypes varies between countries. In Europe and the United States, 60–80% {{of people with}} Guillain–Barré syndrome have the demyelinating subtype (AIDP), and AMAN affects {{only a small number}} (6–7%). In Asia and Central and South America, that proportion is significantly higher (30–65%). This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to the exposure to different kinds of infection, but also the genetic characteristics of that population. Miller Fisher variant is thought to be more common in Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|The only {{reference}} to Bishop Thomas during his episcopate in Finland {{is a letter}} signed by him in Nousiainen in 1234, which granted certain lands around the parish to his chaplain Wilhelm. The lands <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to the papal permission from Pope Gregory IX in early 1229 that authorized the church to take over all non-Christian places of worship in Finland. The letter is the oldest surviving letter written in Finland.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{legend of}} the jackalope, upon which the Wyoming taxidermists were building, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to similar stories in other cultures and other historical times.
