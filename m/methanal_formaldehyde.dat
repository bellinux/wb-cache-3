40|$|Work {{on several}} {{environmentally}} important chemical systems is reported here. First, HOI disproportionation kinetics were studied in acidic solution; acetate inhibits the rate, but sulfate has no effect. Second, the reaction between <b>methanal</b> (<b>formaldehyde)</b> and chloramine was studied {{in a variety}} of buffer systems. The reaction proceeds as follows: NH 2 Cl + CH 2 O → CH(OH) (NHCl) → CH 2 =NCl → ClCN; some steps experience general base assistance. Third, a new distribution-mixing-observation cell has been designed for pulsed-accelerated flow spectrophotometry. The new design reduces the number of connections. Fourth, several methods were adapted for the measurement of various chlorination byproducts (halohydrocarbons, halocarboxylates), ozonation byproducts (aldehydes) and perchlorate and then applied to real systems. Fifth, perchlorate is a relatively new contaminant and is found throughout the southwestern U. S. in natural water supplies. The development of a complexation electrospray ionization mass spectrometric method is discussed and applied to the analysis of water, plant tissue, and fertilizer, as a complementary approach to ion chromatography. ...|$|E
30|$|In an acidic {{environment}} {{and at a}} high temperature, methenamine can release <b>methanal</b> (<b>formaldehyde),</b> and the released methanal can react with polyacrylamide (PAM) and resorcinol to generate phenolic resin via a polycondensation process. Phenolic resin can react further with PAM to produce linear polymers that can block channels (Noller 1965; Xing et al. 2005). Under normal reservoir conditions, an acid (such as HCl solution) is injected to trigger the chain reactions. While {{in the process of}} CO 2 flooding, CO 2 dissolves in formation water and reduces its pH to 2 – 4 (an acidic environment) (Raje et al. 1999; Hild and Wackowski 1999; Cai 2010; Zhang et al. 2013 b, c), then the gel system can become CO 2 -sensitive that only works in high-permeability zones where CO 2 can readily breakthrough or channel out. Therefore, the gel system can selectively block the high-permeability zones or gas channels. The reaction mechanisms involved are as follows: (1) CO 2 dissolves in formation water and generates carbonic acid in situ. Carbonic acid creates an acidic environment that is conductive to the formation of gels. (2) Methenamine releases methanal in the acidic environment at relatively high temperatures. (3) Multi-hydroxymethyl resorcinol may be formed through the reaction between methanal and resorcinol, and via polycondensation of multi-hydroxymenthyl resorcinol, phenolic resin is formed. (4) Large linear polymers may be formed through further polycondensation between phenolic resin and polyacrylamide that can make the gel more stable and strong.|$|E
30|$|In {{this study}} acetic acid was {{selected}} as a prime suspect model pollutant from {{the wide variety of}} pollutants found typically in the air of repositories, based both on its chemical reactivity and its abundance. The majority of the gaseous pollutants to which paper collections are exposed are considered essentially inert. Only a handful of gaseous substances are described in conservation literature to induce chemical reactions in paper [14]. These pollutants can be subdivided into outdoor generated and indoor generated gases. The effect of the outdoor generated pollutants sulfur-dioxide, nitrogen-oxides and ozone on paper has been studied extensively with accelerated aging laboratory experiments [1 – 3, 5, 6, 24 – 27]. Nevertheless, thanks to both policies of outdoor pollution reduction and policies of improvement of the energy efficiency of buildings by reducing the fresh air intake, the typical concentration of such gases in repositories has declined below 5  ppb for sulphur dioxide and ozone and 15  ppb for nitrogen dioxide [28]. Probably as a consequence the focus of conservation research shifted in the last 15  years to investigate the indoor generated pollutants <b>methanal</b> (<b>formaldehyde),</b> ethanoic (acetic) and methanoic (formic) acid [4, 7 – 11, 16, 29 – 36]. Indoor emission of formaldehyde from urea–formaldehyde bonded products like fiberboard has been studied thoroughly in connection to human health. The relevance to paper decay is probably small because chemical reactivity is limited in absence of oxidants [9, 37, 38] and concentrations found in archival storage rooms are below 10  ppb [16]. In contrast to the pollutants discussed above, the two carboxylic acids formic and acetic acid are typically found in storage rooms containing paper at concentration levels up to respectively 70  ppb and 150  ppb [14, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22]. In some special situations containing non-paper emitting sources in closed cabinets, higher concentration levels have been reported [39, 40]. Both acids are generated by oxidative and hydrolytic reactions in organic materials like wood and paper [41 – 43]. If absorbed by less acidic paper materials they might promote chemical decay by catalyzing hydrolysis of cellulose. The transfer of chemically reactive volatile components from certain collection objects to others is commonly referred to as cross-contamination. The laboratory-derived experimental evidences of the detrimental effect of acetic acid in typical archival conditions is nevertheless contradictory. Menart and co-authors [10] extrapolating data collected at an intermediate concentration (1000  ppb) and temperature (60, 70 and 80  °C) in a set-up with continuous gas flushing, which guarantees the attainment of equilibrium between the concentration of the gas in air and in the paper, conclude that “the effect (of acetic acid) in typical archival environments is limited and in some cases insignificant”. On the other side in a modified Oddy test for plastic materials performed at 80  °C and for 14  days, acetic acid has been shown to depolymerize pure cellulose paper [44]. In a similar set-up based on the investigation of the impact of historic storage materials on the carbonyl group content and the weight average molar mass of two types of paper, Becker and co-authors [11] conclude that “the mutual evaluation of formic acid and acetic acid is able to explain increased deterioration despite VOC emissions that are seemingly low at first sight”. Prompted by these contradictory evidences we have searched for indications of acetic acid damage on studies examining directly archival collections.|$|E

50|$|For polyatomic molecules, progressions {{are most}} often {{observed}} when the change in bond lengths upon electronic excitation coincides with the change due to a ″totally symmetric″ vibration. This is the same process that occurs in resonance Raman spectroscopy. For example, in <b>formaldehyde</b> (<b>methanal),</b> H2CO, the n → π* transition involves excitation of an electron from a non-bonding orbital to an antibonding pi orbital which weakens and lengthens the C-O bond. This produces a long progression in the C-O stretching vibration. Another example is furnished by benzene, C6H6. In both gas and liquid phase the band around 250 nm shows a progression in the symmetric ring-breathing vibration.|$|R
40|$|Dihydrogen (H(2)) {{production}} by [FeFe]-hydrogenases is strongly inhibited by <b>formaldehyde</b> (<b>methanal)</b> in a reaction that is rapid, reversible, and specific {{to this type}} of hydrogenase. This discovery, using three [FeFe]-hydrogenases that are homologous about the active site but otherwise structurally distinct, was made by protein film electrochemistry, which measures the activity (as electrical current) of enzymes immobilized on an electrode; importantly, the inhibitor can be removed after addition. Formaldehyde causes rapid loss of proton reduction activity which is restored when the solution is exchanged. Inhibition is confirmed by conventional solution assays. The effect depends strongly on the direction of catalysis: inhibition of H(2) oxidation is much weaker than for H(2) production, and formaldehyde also protects against CO and O(2) inactivation. By contrast, inhibition of [NiFe]-hydrogenases is weak. The results strongly suggest that formaldehyde binds at, or close to, the active site of [FeFe]-hydrogenases at a site unique to this class of enzyme [...] highly conserved lysine and cysteine residues, the bridgehead atom of the dithiolate ligand, or the reduced Fe(d) that is the focal center of catalysis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{industrial}} production of poly (ethylene terephthalate), PET, {{continues to increase}} and thus {{it is important to}} understand the composition of fumes resulting from its disposal as a part of incinerated waste. In this study samples of PET material were combusted in a furnace corresponding to the German standard DIN 53 436 at the temperatures of 500 ○ C, 800 ○ C (in an air flow) and also uncontrolled burning in air. The gaseous products were then analysed using three different analytical methods: high resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Carbon dioxide, methane, ethylene, acetylene, <b>formaldehyde</b> (<b>methanal)</b> and acetaldehyde (ethanal) were detected by FTIR. Water, methane, acetaldehyde, ethylene, formaldehyde, methanol, acetone, benzene, terephthalic acid, styrene (ethenylbenzene), ethanol, toluene (methylbenzene), xylene (dimethylbenzene), ethylbenzene, naphthalene, biphenyl and phenol concentrations were all quantified by both SIFT-MS and GC-MS. Additionally, the fumes resulting from uncontrolled combustion in air were analysed by FTIR which resolves the rotation-vibration structure of the absorption bands of formaldehyde (2779. 90 and 2778. 48 cm - 1) and propane, which was identified from characteristic vibrations of CH 3 groups at 2977. 00 and 2962. 00 cm - 1. The spectra were compared to the reference standards...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{atmospheric}} environment {{inside and}} outside historical organs in several European regions is reported. In each region, comparisons were made between an instrument suffering organ pipe corrosion and an organ without corrosion problems. Concentrations of acetic acid (ethanoic acid), formic acid (methanoic acid), acetaldehyde (ethanal), <b>formaldehyde</b> (<b>methanal)</b> and other volatile organic compounds in the organ environment were determined using active sampling. Temperature and relative humidity were recorded. In addition, polished metal samples that mimic the material used in the historical organ pipes have been exposed in the organ wind systems for up to 22 months. High concentrations of acetic acid and formic acid vapours {{are present in the}} wind system of the corroded organs. Acetaldehyde and formaldehyde are also present in smaller amounts. The main source of acetic acid is the wood from which the wind system is built. In contrast, formic acid is generated in the chruch environment outside the wind system. The results show that the two organic acids {{play an important role in}} the atmospheric corrosion of organ pipes. It is suggested that the corrosion of lead pipes in historical organs can be effectively reduced by removing the sources of gaseous acetic acid and formic acid in the wind system and in the chruch environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of corrosion products and the corrosion sensitivity of copper and lead were studied under experimental {{conditions in which}} <b>formaldehyde</b> (<b>methanal),</b> formic (methanoic) and acetic (ethanoic) acid concentration, relative humidity (RH) and duration of exposure were varied. Levels of formic acid above 0. 4 parts per million based on volume (ppmv) affect the appearance of copper at 75 % RH, and at levels above 4 ppmv the copper gains weight at both 54 and 75 % RH. The main compound found on copper was cuprite, copper(I) oxide. Lead has a higher sensitivity to formic acid: at levels as low as 0. 04 ppmv lead becomes darker, and at above 0. 1 ppmv weight gains were measurable at both 54 and 75 % RH, In the presence of different levels of mixed carbonyl vapours at 75 % RH, copper reacted mainly with formic acid. On the other hand, the reaction of lead was more complex. Acetic acid tends to form a thick white layer (composed mainly of plumbonacrite and possibly lead acetate compounds) on the lead surface, while formic acid tends to form a rather thin and darker layer of lead formate hydroxide. In the presence of formic acid, the action of acetic acid on lead was inhibited. At levels of formaldehyde up to 3 ppmv, no significant contribution of formaldehyde to the corrosion process on lead and copper was observed. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
