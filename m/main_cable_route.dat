40|$|Engineering tlie <b>cable</b> <b>route</b> {{into the}} safest route is a {{subjective}} job {{although there are}} certain standard industry rules {{that need to be}} applied. The <b>cable</b> <b>route</b> is planned using charts produced on the survey vessel. Geophysical and geotechnical datasets are studied in detail, to ensure that the route is optimised with regard to steep slopes, unfavourable seabed, seabed debris, and sediment depth. A survey was carried out {{in the southern part of}} the Red Sea, in order to produce a chart upon which the submarine <b>cable</b> <b>route</b> can be engineered. The Red Sea contains very rough topography, which sometimes hamper the data acquisition, interpretation and ultimately the <b>cable</b> <b>route</b> engineering. The charts produced did allow the <b>cable</b> <b>route</b> to be engineered with confidence that once laid it will survive its operational life. However, the multibeam data was processed using the gridding method, which reduced the quality of the data. Also there is a slight lack of confidence in the interpretation of the lithology as no predictions can be made on the mobility of sediments are the chances of a buried cable becoming exposed. With more accurate data, the route may be refined (even by just a small amount) along a shorter route thereby saving on costs from the shorter length of cable and possible avoidance of expensive armour types. Survey methods, which could be carried out in order to reduce dangers to towed equipment, are also discussed. Faculty of Scienc...|$|R
25|$|In {{suspension}} bridges, large <b>main</b> <b>cables</b> (normally two) hang {{between the}} towers and are anchored {{at each end}} to the ground. This {{can be difficult to}} implement when ground conditions are poor. The <b>main</b> <b>cables,</b> which are free to move on bearings in the towers, bear the load of the bridge deck. Before the deck is installed, the cables are under tension from their own weight. Along the <b>main</b> <b>cables</b> smaller cables or rods connect to the bridge deck, which is lifted in sections. As this is done, the tension in the cables increases, as it does with the live load of traffic crossing the bridge. The tension on the <b>main</b> <b>cables</b> is transferred to the ground at the anchorages and by downwards tug on the towers.|$|R

5000|$|In some {{contexts}} {{the term}} [...] "simple suspension bridge" [...] refers not {{to this type}} of bridge but rather to a suspended deck bridge that is [...] "simple" [...] in that its deck is not stiffened. [...] Although simple suspension bridges and [...] "simple" [...] suspended deck bridges are similar in many respects, they differ in their physics. On a simple suspension bridge, the <b>main</b> <b>cables</b> (or chains) follow a hyperbolic curve, the catenary. This is because the <b>main</b> <b>cables</b> are free hanging. In contrast, on a suspended deck bridge (whether [...] "simple" [...] or not) the <b>main</b> <b>cables</b> follow a parabolic curve. This is because the <b>main</b> <b>cables</b> are tied at uniform intervals to the bridge deck below (see suspension bridge curve). The differences between these two curves was a question of importance in the 17th century, worked on by Isaac Newton among others.|$|R

Double-armor cable was selected for additional rodent and lightning protection. A major concern of this type of installation is the susceptibility of the cable to lightning damage. An estimation of the frequency and extent of damage to the cable is derived from the trouble history of similar installations, and essential grounding methods are described. Trouble History The most reliable indication of the need for lightning protection on a particular <b>cable</b> <b>route</b> is a history of lightning trouble. The recorded lightning trouble history for the <b>cable</b> <b>route</b> over a period of at least 10 years might suggest the need for lightning protection.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The Humber Bridge officially opened in 1981 and carries 4 lanes of traffic across the Humber Estuary between Barton and Hessle {{to the west}} of Kingston-upon-Hull in East Yorkshire, England.
