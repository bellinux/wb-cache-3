The technology parameters of the heavy-duty multi-legged robots, such as BigDog [9], Ambler [10], ATHLETE [11, 12], and Dante II [13], concludes that the heavy-duty multi-legged robots have three major characteristics comparing to the non-heavy-duty or small multi-legged robots; they are the larger volume, bigger mass, and larger load to mass ratio [14].|$|R

Normally a mechanism would be balanced using a trial and error method, which repeats the use of trial weights and measurements until the mechanism is balanced, however this method is time consuming and therefore costly. This report presents a method that detects, locates and quantifies the error(s) in a force balanced mechanism, after just one test run. An adjustable 1 -DoF rotating mechanism is developed and a sensitivity analysis is performed to obtain the shaking force response of each parameter error. Comparing the shaking force response with the theoretical values shows the effectiveness of the adjustable 1 -DoF rotating mechanism. Then the inversed relations of these shaking force responses are plotted in a design chart which can trace back the parameters that need adjusting. The method demonstrates that a 1 -DoF mechanism can be balanced after just one test run. ...|$|R

Although still not as accurate as sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325, and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand, making {{the reading of the}} clock more precise and convenient. One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by water pressure: when the container holding the water was full, the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman horologists beginning in 100, and improvements continued {{to be made in the}} following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or <b>moving</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze.|$|R
