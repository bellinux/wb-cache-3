40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{overview}} of our ongoing systematic search for wide (sub) stellar companions around the stars known to host rad-vel planets. By using a relatively large field of view and going very deep our survey can find all directly detectable stellar and brown dwarf companions (m> 40 MJup) within a 1000 AU orbit. As of may 2003 <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>hundreds</b> extra-solar were found. Some of those planets are found in binary stellar systems. Those cases are intriguing, and might even exhibit some statistical different features than the planets around single stars (Zucker & Mazeh 2002). It is therefore that we started a systematic deep imaging of the stars known to have planets to look for faint companions in wide orbits. Several groups have already searched for very close stellar companions using adaptive optics, but these searched could not find wide companions due to their too small field of view. By using a relatively large field of view and going very deep our survey will find all stellar and even brown dwarf companions (m> 40 MJup) within a 1000 AU orbit...|$|R

5|$|Boron {{is found}} in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often {{associated}} with other elements. <b>More</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>hundred</b> borate minerals contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never contain boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na+) in borax.|$|E
5|$|Due {{partly to}} the limited success of his latest book outside Indiana, Riley was persuaded to begin working with other midwestern writers to attempt to form an {{association}} to promote their work.

They held their first meeting in July, naming themselves the Western Association of Writers. At the meeting Maurice Thompson was named president, and Riley vice president. The association never succeeded in its goals of creating a powerful advertising force, but became a social club and a rival literary community to the eastern writing establishment. Riley was disappointed with the shortcomings of the group, but came to depend on its regular meetings as a escape from his normally hectic schedule.|$|E
