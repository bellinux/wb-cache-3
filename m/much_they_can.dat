5|$|All {{weapons and}} apparel {{found within the}} Wastelands, {{regardless}} of whether they are a makeshift-weapon such as a lead pipe, or a gun, degrade over time the more they are used, and thus become less effective. For firearms, degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading, while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks. When too much damage is taken, the items breaks and cannot be used. To ensure weapons and apparel are working effectively, such items require constant maintenance and repairs which can be done in one of two ways. The first method is find certain vendors that repair items, though how <b>much</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> repair an item depends on their skill level, while the cost of the repairs depends upon the item itself. The second method is for players to find a second of the same item that needs repairs (or a comparable item), and salvaging parts from it for the repair, though how <b>much</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> do depends on their character's own skill level in repairs.|$|E

Further circuit elements would probably {{be found in a}} real design that would roll-off the frequency response above the needed range to prevent the possibility of unwanted oscillation.

500|$|The character's main love {{interest}} throughout his duration on {{the soap opera}} was Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson), whom he married in 2011. Nichols had previously stated {{in an interview that}} he thought Tucker would [...] "definitely 'team up' when he finds the right woman". Davidson stated in an interview that the pair will [...] "have their ups and downs, but they're definitely in each other's lives." [...] In September 2011, it is revealed that Tucker is the biological father of Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), the result of a long-ago affair with Harmony Hamilton (Debbi Morgan). When asked of Tucker's reaction to the news, Morgan stated: [...] "It's revealed that Devon was the result of a one-night stand between Harmony and Tucker. That night meant the world to her—Tucker was the love of her life—but it meant so little to him that he doesn't even recognize Harmony when they meet again. Not a clue! It's like a dagger through her heart." [...] James said he was [...] "overjoyed" [...] at the revelation, stating: [...] "There's so <b>much</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> do with this story. The relationship between Tucker and Devon—my character allowing that relationship to grow. How it affects Neil. And there's a plethora of possibilities that can come from his relationship with Mrs. Chancellor. I'm sure that relationship will develop just as it will with Devon and Tucker. And then, there's Devon's mother, Harmony, who is back." [...] Tucker and Ashley's marriage ended the following year, after he cheated on her with Harmony. Following their divorce, Nichols stated in an interview with Xfinity that Tucker would [...] "have to find a new woman" [...] as he [...] "can't be without female companionship".|$|E

2500|$|PaX {{provides}} {{two methods}} of NX bit emulation, called SEGMEXEC and PAGEEXEC. The SEGMEXEC method imposes a measurable but low overhead, typically less than 1%, {{which is a}} constant scalar incurred due to the virtual memory mirroring used for the separation between execution and data accesses. [...] SEGMEXEC also {{has the effect of}} halving the task's virtual address space, allowing the task to access less memory than it normally could. [...] This is not a problem until the task requires access to more than half the normal address space, which is rare. SEGMEXEC does not cause programs to use more system memory (i.e. RAM), it only restricts how <b>much</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> access. [...] On 32-bit CPUs, this becomes 1.5GB rather than 3GB.|$|E
2500|$|During filming, {{fourteen}} different {{horses were}} used as the main horse character Joey, eight of them portraying him as an adult animal, four as a colt and two as foals; four horses played the other main equine character, Topthorn. Up to 280 horses were used in a single scene. A farrier was on set to replace horseshoes sucked off in the mud during filming, and the horses playing the main horse characters had a specialist equine make-up team, with their coats dyed and markings added to ensure continuity. Equine artist Ali Bannister {{was responsible for the}} 'hair and make-up' of the horses, as well as drawing the sketches of horses that are featured in the film. Extra filming involving a bay foal took place in California in March 2011. Working with horses on this scale was a new experience for Spielberg, who commented: [...] "The horses were an extraordinary experience for me, because several members of my family ride. I was really amazed at how expressive horses are and how <b>much</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> show what they’re feeling." ...|$|E

60|$|It is not, however, always easy, {{either in}} {{painting}} or literature, {{to determine where}} the influence of language stops, and where that of thought begins. Many thoughts are so dependent upon the language {{in which they are}} clothed, that they would lose half their beauty if otherwise expressed. But the highest thoughts are those which are least dependent on language, and the dignity of any composition and praise to which it is entitled, are in exact proportion to its independency of language or expression. A composition is indeed usually most perfect, when to such intrinsic dignity is added all that expression can do to attract and adorn; but in every case of supreme excellence this all becomes as nothing. We are more gratified by the simplest lines or words which can suggest the idea in its own naked beauty, than by the robe or the gem which conceal while they decorate; we are better pleased to feel by their absence how little they would bestow, than by their presence how <b>much</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> destroy.|$|E
