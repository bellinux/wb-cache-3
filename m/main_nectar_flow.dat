50|$|The {{development}} of a bee colony follows an annual cycle of growth that begins in spring with a rapid expansion of the brood nest, as soon as pollen is available for feeding larvae. Some production of brood may begin as early as January, even in a cold winter, but breeding accelerates towards a peak in May (in the northern hemisphere), producing an abundance of harvesting bees synchronized to the <b>main</b> <b>nectar</b> <b>flow</b> in that region. Each race of bees times this build-up slightly differently, {{depending on how the}} flora of its original region blooms. Some regions of Europe have two nectar flows: one in late spring and another in late August. Other regions have only a single nectar flow. The skill of the beekeeper lies in predicting when the nectar flow will occur in his area and in trying to ensure that his colonies achieve a maximum population of harvesters at exactly the right time.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} reports results of {{qualitative}} melittopalynological analyses of 34 honey samples of Apis cerana and Apis mellifera between 2011 and 2012 in Mengzi (China Yunnan) and the trophic niche analysis of two bee species on pollen food resources. A diverse spectrum of 17 pollen types from 14 families was {{identified with the}} Asteraceae and Myrtaceae being most frequent at non-nectar flow and the Lythraceae being most frequent at <b>main</b> <b>nectar</b> <b>flow</b> of pomegranate. The results of trophic niche analysis to Apis cerana and Apis mellifera are these, at non-nectar flow, the Niche breadth are 0. 65 and 0. 57, respectively; at nectar flow, the values are 0. 41 and 0. 24, respectively. Trophic niche overlap index, the value of nectar flow(0. 68) is greater than non-nectar flow(0. 61). Interspecific competition index, the value of nectar flow(0. 92) is also greater than non-nectar flow(0. 77). These results may promote the development of local beekeeping and help scholars assessing the impact of introduced bees on native bees in China. </p...|$|E
40|$|Larvae, artificially {{infected}} when 0 to 1 day {{old with}} Streptococcus pluton (White) {{and placed in}} colonies, were usually ejected by adult bees. Ejection was delayed from colonies deprived either of unsealed brood or their queen, or which were reinforced with adult bees. The feces of surviving larvae whose weight was subnormal, contained many viable cells of S. pluton. Colonies reinforced with unsealed brood removed more infected larvae than usual. It is concluded that infected larvae are ejected when larval food is merely adequate, {{as it may be}} when a colony is growing rapidly; and they are kept when larval food is more abundant, as it may be when brood rearing is retarded. Natural outbreaks of disease occurred when brood-rearing, in colonies heavily infected with S. pluton, was increasing during <b>nectar</b> <b>flows,</b> which was also when secondary infection with Bacterium eurydice White increased. At such times, larvae heavily infected with both organisms may die quicker than they are being removed. At the same time infection of new larvae with S. pluton seemed to decrease: transmission of S. pluton was presumably checked by the death and ejection of unsealed larvae. Thus outbreaks usually seemed to be self-limiting. Colonies eject introduced larvae even more readily after the <b>main</b> <b>nectar</b> <b>flows</b> which may account for the difficulty in causing disease artificially at this time...|$|R
40|$|Unfavourable weather {{conditions}} after the queen starts with intensive oviposition during early spring may cause an imbalance {{in the division}} of tasks among worker bees in the bee colony. This can lead to slow spring development and poor exploitation of the <b>main</b> spring <b>nectar</b> <b>flows.</b> In order to accelerate the spring development, it is necessary, as a technological measure, to feed supplemental candy to bee colonies. In this research, the necessity of supplemental feeding, {{as well as the}} composition of candy (pollen and protein substitute) were analysed. Three groups of ten bee colonies each were formed - the control, unfed group, pollen candy fed and protein substitute candy fed. In the period from 22 / 02 / 2016 and 04 / 04 / 2016 three control measurements were performed during which the number of bees, the number of brood cells and weight of the bee colonies were determined. The research has shown that supplemental feeding of the bee colony in late winter in order to encourage the rapid spring development is justified. Namely, at the final measurements in April, the results showed differences between groups. The treated colonies had higher net hive weight, a greater number of bees and statistically significantly more brood cells. The results of this study confirm that the technological measure of supplemental feeding in late winter should be performed on all commercial apiaries for the production of honey, pollen, royal jelly, queen bees and bee venom...|$|R

We examined the assessment of <b>nectar</b> <b>flow</b> rate by nectar-feeding ants, Camponotus rufipes. Single workers from a laboratory colony were trained to visit an artificial feeder providing 20 % sucrose solution either ad libitum or at controlled flow rates (0. 118 – 2. 36 l/min). These flow rates simulate the conditions faced by workers when visiting plant extrafloral nectaries. Ants adjusted their visit times to the different flow rates, so that the time spent at the feeder decreased with increasing <b>nectar</b> <b>flow</b> rates. The volume of nectar collected increased with increasing <b>nectar</b> <b>flow</b> rates, and workers were observed to return to the nest with partially filled crops. To investigate the rules used by ants to decide when to depart from the patch, we confronted experienced workers on their fifth visit with a depleted patch, and recorded the time spent there before leaving.

50|$|Clover {{sickness}} in {{more recent}} times may also be linked to pollinator decline; clovers are most efficiently pollinated by bumblebees, which have declined {{as a result of}} agricultural intensification. Honeybees can also pollinate clover, and beekeepers are often in heavy demand from farmers with clover pastures.

Beekeepers benefit from the clover bloom, as clover is one of the <b>main</b> <b>nectar</b> sources for honeybees.|$|R
40|$|Insect {{pollination}} {{is vital}} to both {{the health of our}} ecosystem and food production. Consequently, {{it is important to understand}} how the phenology of both pollinators and plants will be influenced by global climate change. Current satellites allow a near-daily synoptic view of the entire earth, but it is difficult linking the imagery with in situ events because of the difference in scale between a point and pixel. Due to their generalized foraging on a variety of plants in the 100 km 2 surrounding their hive, honey bees operate at a scale which may be compared to satellite data. The MODIS Aqua and Terra satellites produce daily images of the earth and the Normalized Differentiation Vegetation Index (NDVI) is able to show the “green-up” or start of spring (SOS). Locally, the phenology of nectar-producing flowers can be inferred from the honey bee <b>nectar</b> <b>flow</b> (HBNF), which is measured by the weight gain of a honey bee hive. This research investigates the link between smoothed, gap-filled NDVI data, and weight gain of hives in Slovenia, Switzerland, Belgium and Finland during 2009 - 2012. No correlation was found between the SOS and HBNF start day, but a notable relationship (R 2 = 0. 73) was seen between NDVI SOS and HBNF midpoint (50 % day) within the Alps and broadleaf forests of central Europe. This indicates that HBNF can be related to continental MODIS climate models, and that <b>nectar</b> <b>flows</b> have been advancing 0. 54 days per year in central Europe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Accurate {{thermoregulation}} {{in honey}} bees {{is crucial for}} colony survival. Multiple factors influence how colonies manage in-hive temperature, including genetic diversity. We explored the influence of genetic diversity on thermoregulatory behavior under three conditions: natural foraging, supplemental feeding, and exposure to the fungal pathogen shown to induce a social fever in honey bees. Our data suggest that (1) the degree of genetic diversity expected under normal conditions is not predictive of thermoregulatory stability, (2) the social fever response of honey bees {{is not a simple}} stimulus–response mechanism but appears to be influenced by ambient temperature conditions, and (3) a temperature-based circadian rhythm emerges under high <b>nectar</b> <b>flow</b> conditions.

50|$|Depending on the nectar and pollen {{sources in}} a given area, {{the maximum number of}} hives that can be placed in one apiary can vary. If too many hives are placed into an apiary, the hives compete with each other for scarce resources. This can lead to lower honey and pollen yields, higher {{transmission}} of disease and robbing. The maximum size of a permanent apiary or bee yard may depend on the type of bee as well. Some honey bee species or races fly farther than others. A circle around an apiary with a three-mile (5 km) foraging radius covers 28 sq mi. A good rule of thumb is to have no more than 25-35 hives in a permanent apiary, although migrating beekeepers may temporarily place one hundred hives into a location with a good <b>nectar</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{geographically}} restricted Tasmanian endemic Cyathodes divaricata Hook. f. is functionally dioe-cious but, unusually, is pollinated {{by several}} species of nectarivorous birds including honeyeaters (Meliphagidae). It has evolved in a clade otherwise conforming to the typical dioecious pollination syndrome of small white flowers serviced by small insects. A number of its features are consistent with ornithophily in other Epacridaceae, includ-ing a tubular pendant odourless corolla, a winter peak in flowering and a copious diurnal <b>nectar</b> <b>flow.</b> However, the flower largely retains the white, insect-attractive colour of its congeners. Male plants have more and larger flowers, begin flowering earlier in the season, and yield significantly more nectar per flower than female plants. The fruits produced on female plants were 22 % larger than the few produced on male plants. These {{findings are consistent with}} recent theories on the biology of dioecy.

25|$|The {{majority}} of host plants for gulf fritillaries come from Lantana and Passiflora, two genuses of flowering {{plants in the}} Verbenaceae and Passifloraceae families, respectively. Many of the adult butterflies use Lantana plants as their <b>main</b> <b>nectar</b> and food source whereas the Passiflora plants serve as the main resource and foodplants for the larvae. The Passiflora host plants are frequently called passion vines; in some Texan counties where this butterfly's population is high, gulf fritillaries will feed on specific species such as Passiflora lutea and Passiflora affinis. These passion vine plants are suitable host plants as they provide a good structure for larval host habitats which enables young populations of gulf fritillaries to be sufficiently nurtured and protected. The role of host plants is also integral to the oviposition of gulf fritillaries, as the female butterflies lay their eggs {{on or near the}} host plant.|$|R
5000|$|Eva Crane [...] relegates John Evelyn's hive to her {{chapter on}} the history of {{observation}} hives. Obviously, any 'transparent' hive with glass windows or sides allows observation of the bees without opening the hive, but the Stewarton hive uses windows at the front and back as part of the system for managing the hives. Put simply, with the sliders inserted in the central portion of the box {{at the top of the}} brood nest, thus inhibiting the queen from laying above,the withdrawal of the sliders to the sides allows workers to begin drawing comb and storing honey at the sides of the honey box above. As the <b>nectar</b> <b>flow</b> proceeds, and more honey is stored this comb is built from both sides towards the centre. The beekeeper can establish whether the bees require more space by opening the windows. If light can be seen, comb building in that box is not finished and no super is required. If the view through the windows is obscured by comb and bees, then that box is nearly full and a new box can be added above.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis review {{considers}} how a {{honey bee}} colony optimally controls {{the timing and}} type of new comb construction. Optimal timing requires bees to balance the energy costs of construction with the opportunity costs of lacking storage space during <b>nectar</b> <b>flows.</b> They do so by conditioning the start of building on (1) the attainment of a fullness threshold, and (2) the availability of nectar. A dynamic optimization model has suggested that this rule is slightly suboptimal, but may compensate for this by its simplicity and generality. The emergence of this collective strategy from the decisions of individual bees is poorly understood, but recent experiments have {{cast doubt on the}} long-standing idea that building is triggered by increased distension of the crops of nest bees. Bees also regulate the relative amounts of drone and worker comb in their nests, with important consequences for their sex investment strategy. Regulation depends on the inhibitory effect of drone comb on further drone comb construction, mediated through a decentralized process requiring that workers have direct contact with the comb. Contact by the queen is not required, nor is the presence of drone brood, although the latter may enhance the strength of inhibition...|$|R
40|$|The {{colonies of}} the giant {{honeybee}} (Apis dorsata) immigrate in the semiarid environment of Northwest India in October-November {{with the onset of}} flowering on pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) /toria (Brassica campestris var. toria), stay here during the rich pollen and <b>nectar</b> <b>flow</b> period from December to mid-May, and emigrate in late May/early June when floral dearth is witnessed.

However, about 20 percent of the old colonies were infested with Tropilaelaps clareae and 100 percent of the old colonies with Galleria mellonella; none of the swarm colonies had these pests. While the migration schedule of this honeybee remained similar year after year, the number of colonies immigrating in this region declined markedly over the years; the number in 2012 was even less than half of that recorded in 1984.
