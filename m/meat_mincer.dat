50|$|Carpenter, {{recruited}} from Hastings, Victoria, {{played for the}} TAC Cup side Dandenong Stingrays, where he debuted in 2004. When Carpenter was four years old, he got his hand caught in a <b>meat</b> <b>mincer</b> at his father's butcher shop, requiring the amputation of half of his left arm just below the elbow. Carpenter has a short, blunt stump of his forearm, which {{he is able to}} hold and manipulate objects with. Despite this handicap, he says he has become accustomed to living without it and has forged a career in Australian rules football.|$|E
50|$|A {{meat grinder}} or <b>meat</b> <b>mincer</b> is a kitchen {{appliance}} for fine chopping ('mincing') and/or mixing of raw or cooked meat, fish, vegetables or similar food. It replaces tools like the mincing knife, for example, {{which is also}} used to produce minced meat, filling, etc. The producer puts the minced food into a funnel, which is placed {{on the top of the}} grinder. From there the material goes on a horizontal screw conveyor. This screw conveyor, which can be powered by a hand wheel or an electric motor, squashes and partially mixes the food. At the end of the screw, conveyor there is a knife installed directly in front of the fixed hole plate. At this opening the minced meat comes out of the machine. The fineness of the meat depends on the size of the holes of the plate.|$|E
30|$|The {{experimental}} diets {{were prepared}} by thoroughly mixing {{the dry ingredients}} with oil and water in a Hobart mixer. The moist dough was then screw-pressed through a 2 -mm die in a <b>meat</b> <b>mincer</b> and the feed pellets formed were fan-dried. After forced air-drying the pellets for at least 6  h to improve water stability, the diets were then crumbled into appropriate sizes (0.5 – 1.5  mm) and stored at − 20  °C in airtight polyethylene bags until required.|$|E
50|$|Following an {{inspection}} in May 2015, Baxters was instructed by HSE to improve safety at its Fochabers manufacturing plant. HSE found {{that exposure to}} flour dust, {{which can lead to}} asthma, was not controlled satisfactorily. Measures {{to reduce the risk of}} injury to staff during the loading of <b>meat</b> <b>mincers</b> were also found to be inadequate. Baxters responded that it was working hard to rectify the matters raised.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the author’s Mincer: an ‘evolved’ sound generating object {{of which the}} mechanical properties and physical material of a <b>meat</b> <b>mincer</b> (grinder) are exploited. Through looking at the Mincer in detail, the author suggests a number of characteristics of the device that reflect current trends {{within the field of}} live electronics. This includes working with and appropriating found objects, do-it-yourself (DIY) electronics, bricolage, an emphasis on physical gesture, and sound generating systems celebrating super-hybridity...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to stabilize minced meat by fermentation using mixed lactic acid bacteria cultures isolated from natural fermented foodstuffs and selected for their antimicrobial activity against some hazardous microorganisms. Fresh meat of camel purchased from the slaughterhouse of Rabat (Morocco) was minced separately with a <b>meat</b> <b>mincer</b> and supplied with 5 % glucose, then inoculated with lactic acid bacteria. Microbiological analyses were carried out to determine standard plate count (SPC), staphylococci, coliforms, enterococci, and lactic acid bacteria. All analyses were determined after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 days during the storage. Results showed that a low pH of 4. 0 - 4. 2 can be achieved (within 3 days at 22 ºC), with a drastic reduction in SPC, coliforms, enterococci and staphylococci. Results suggested {{that the use of}} lactic acid bacteria would help in preserving fresh camel meat for extended periods at 22 ºC...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to study the effect of sucrose level on the physico-chemical properties of goat surimi. The muscle tissue of round meat of goat was separated from fat and connective tissue manually and then was cut into 3 cm size of meat for mincing by using <b>meat</b> <b>mincer.</b> Then, the minced meat was washed three times by using chilling water (5 - 10 oC) which the final washing used chilled 0. 5 % NaCl solution. The ratio of water to minced meat in washing was 3 : 1. The final step was dewatering by pressing washed minced meat in the screen of linen mesh manually. Finally, raw surimi was stirred with sucrose 3 % (P 1), 4 % (P 2) and 5 % (P 3) and added sodium tripolyphosphate 0. 2 % for each treatment. The result showed that both pH and Water Holding Capacity (WHC) increased significantly from P 1 (P< 0. 05), whereas the gel strength was no different. The incline of WHC {{was followed by the}} incline of crude protein content. However, sucrose could not affect ash and fat content as well as salt-soluble protein. Sucrose supplementation at 4 % in goat surimi produced the best characteristics of goat surimi...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{spots on}} a <b>meat</b> <b>mincer</b> {{in a large}} {{catering}} facility were sampled four times over a three-month period after routine cleaning and disinfection. Spot 2 carried a significantly higher average microbial load than the other spots and was the only spot with a persistent population of fluorescent pseudomonads. The predominant type of fluorescent pseudomonads produced a yellow diffusible pigment and were always found in turkey meat. Since turkey was also the last type of meat minced on each working day, it was considered the likely source of these bacteria on the mincer. Sixty-three yellow-fluorescing pseudomonad strains from unminced turkey and 17 strains from mincer spot 2 after mincing, cleaning, and disinfection were subjected to fingerprint analysis by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and by analysis of the assimilation patterns of 95 carbon sources using the Biolog system. Cluster analysis of the RAPD and the metabolic fingerprints revealed that all the mincer strains formed a homogeneous cluster, exclusive of all the turkey strains which displayed {{a higher degree of}} heterogeneity. Six strains isolated 1 week earlier and six strains isolated 11 weeks earlier from spot 2 were also subjected to RAPD analysis. Their fingerprints fell within the existing cluster of 17 spot 2 strains. These results suggest the existence on mincer spot 2 of an endemic flora of fluorescent pseudomonads, probably {{in the form of a}} biofilm. The genetic and physiological homogeneity of this flora, as opposed to the het erogeneity of the raw meat flora, indicates that only a fraction of the raw meat population of P. fluorescens is successful in forming biofilm in this environment. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} aims {{to evaluate}} the quality of biopellets made from different composition of the oilpalm trunk powder and Laban wood charcoal with different type of adhesive. The composition consist of 25 % oilpalm powder : 75 % Laban wood charcoal; 50 % oilpalm powder: 50 % Laban wood charcoal; 75 % oilpalm powder : 25 % Laban wood charcoal; 100 % oilpalm powder respectively. The adhesives used are tapioca flour and sago flour. The research used completely factorial randomized design, which consists of eight combination treatment with 3 replications. The material was mixed manually and biopellets produced with <b>meat</b> <b>mincer</b> in home scale with size 2 cm long and diameter 0. 4 cm. Biopelet then dry in oven for 24 hour with temperature 600 C- 700 C. The quality of biopelet was evaluate according to SNI 8021 : 2014. The result of research showed that the average values of water content of biopellets was range between 6. 91 % - 9. 98 %; the average values of ash content was range between 1. 02 % - 1. 69 %; the average values of volatile matter content was range between 38. 36 % - 71. 93 %; the average values of fixed carbon content was range between 26. 45 % - 59. 97 % and the average values of calor was range between 3719, 67 (cal/g)  5944, 33 (cal/g). The composition of oilpalm and Laban wood charcoal and type of adhesives was significantly affected the calor value of biopellets. Meanwhile the other values such as moisture content, ash content, volatile matter content and fixed carbon content was not significant. The quality of biopellets can fulfill the SNI 8021 : 2014 standard, except on ash content. The best biopellets was achieved on composition 25 % oil palm trunk powder : 75 % Laban wood charcoal with adhesive tapioca. Keywords : Biopellets, Laban wood, Oilpalm trunk, tapioca, sag...|$|E
