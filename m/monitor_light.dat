40|$|A new {{technique}} to <b>monitor</b> <b>light</b> diffraction patterns electrically {{is applied to}} frog semitendinosus muscle fibers at various levels of stretch. The intensity of the diffraction lines, sarcomere length change, and the length-dispersion (line width) were calculated by fast analogue circuits and displayed in real time. A heliumneon laser (wavelength 6328 Å) {{was used as a}} light source. It was found that the intensity of the first-order diffraction line drops significantly (30 - 50 %) at an optimal sarcomere length of 2. 8 μm on isometric tetanic stimulation. Such stimulation produced contraction of half-sarcomeres by about 22 nm presumably by stretching inactive elements such as tendons. The dispersion of the sarcomere lengths is extremely small, and it is proportional to the sarcomere length (less than 4 %). The dispersion increases on stimulation. These changes on isometric tetanic stimulation were dependent on sarcomere length. No vibration or oscillation in the averaged length of the sarcomeres was found during isometric tetanus within a resolution of 3 nm; however, our observation of increased length dispersion of the sarcomeres together with detection of the averaged shortening of the sarcomere lengths suggests the presence of asynchronous cyclic motions between thick and thin filaments. An alternative explanation is simply an increase of the length dispersion of sarcomeres without cyclic motions...|$|E
40|$|PIXELATED geiger-mode {{avalanche}} photodiodes(PPDs), {{often called}} silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are emerging as an excellent replacement for traditional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) {{in a variety}} of detectors, especially those for subatomic physics experiments, which requires extensive test and operation procedures in order to achieve uniform responses from all the devices. In this paper, we show for two PPD brands, Hamamatsu MPPC and SensL SPM, that the dark noise rate, breakdown voltage and rate of correlated avalanches can be inferred from the sole measure of dark current as a function of operating voltage, hence greatly simplifying the characterization procedure. We introduce a custom electronics system that allows measurement for many devices concurrently, hence allowing rapid testing and monitoring of many devices at low cost. Finally, we show that the dark current of Hamamastu Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC) is rather independent of temperature at constant operating voltage, hence the current measure cannot be used to probe temperature variations. On the other hand, the MPPC current can be used to <b>monitor</b> <b>light</b> source conditions in DC mode without requiring strong temperature stability, as long as the integrated source brightness is comparable to the dark noise rate.

RXTE Proportional Counter Array observations carried out between 1996 September 20 – 22 provided 60 % observing efficiency for 48 hours around phase zero. These observations showed significant dipping activity during much of those two days. The dramatic spectral evolution associated with the dips is well-fit by variable and at times heavy absorption (NH> 10 24 cm − 2) of a bright component, plus an underlying faint component which is not attenuated by the variable column and whose flux is about 10 % of that of the unabsorbed bright component. A prominent iron emission line at 6. 4 – 6. 6 keV is evident during the dips. The absolute line flux outside the dips {{is similar to that}} during the dips, with equivalent width increasing from as low as 44 eV outside dips to more than 400 eV during dips, indicating that the line is associated with the faint component.

SMC X- 1, consisting of a neutron star and a massive companion, exhibits superorbital modulation with a period varying between 40 d and 65 d. We applied the HHT on the light curve observed by the All-Sky Monitor onboard Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) to obtain the instantaneous frequency of the superorbital modulation of SMC X- 1. The resultant Hilbert spectrum {{is consistent with the}} dynamic power spectrum while it shows more detailed information in both the time and frequency domains. According to the instantaneous frequency, we found a correlation between the superorbital period and the modulation amplitude. Combining the spectral observation made by the Proportional Counter Array onboard RXTE and the superorbital phase derived in the HHT, we performed a superorbital phase-resolved spectral analysis of SMC X- 1. An analysis of the spectral parameters versus the orbital phase for different superorbital states revealed that the diversity of nH has an orbital dependence. Furthermore, we obtained the variation in the eclipse profiles by folding the All Sky <b>Monitor</b> <b>light</b> curve with orbital period for different superorbital states.

40|$|While {{assessment}} is the quantitative evaluation of selected ecosystem attributes, monitoring {{can be defined}} as the systematic repetition of the assessment process. That is, monitoring is the systematic and objective measurement of the same attributes on a regular schedule over time (Callaway et al. 2001). Monitoring can serve two primary roles: evaluation of the quality of existing conditions of an area (e. g., site, reach, management area), and assessment of the development of an area following implementation of a management action (e. g., permit approval for shoreline development; habitat restoration, creation, or protection). In the latter case, the monitoring shows whether or not the management action has any effect {{on the quality of the}} area. In either role, monitoring provides valuable and sometime critical information for making accurate and cost-effective management decisions. Without objective quantitative information, decisions are driven by guesswork, which may lead to further degradation of an area and inefficient use of funds, resources, and effort. In nearshore ecosystems, monitoring provides the basis for understanding existing conditions, and can be integral to determining the extent of improvement or degradation of a particular site, reach, or management area.
