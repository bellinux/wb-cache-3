5|$|A new Prisons Act {{was passed}} in 1981, which updated the 1903 act and its eleven {{amendments}} with modern philosophies and practices – codifying departmental orders, instructions, and policy documents. The act was, however, slanted towards prisoner management and safety, as the government and opposition were <b>mindful</b> <b>of</b> public opinion, {{and the perception of}} lax security at Fremantle. The result was legislation criticised by the Criminal Lawyers Association, academics, and newspapers, including for minimal welfare provisions that did little to ensure prisoner welfare. The department was at the same time renamed the Prisons Department once more, to emphasise imprisonment as its primary responsibility.|$|E

5|$|Brudenell {{was a fine}} rider and, {{inspired}} by the decisive role of cavalry {{at the battle of}} Waterloo, his wish was to purchase a commission in a fashionable regiment and serve as an army officer. His father, however, <b>mindful</b> <b>of</b> preserving the family pedigree from risk of battle, would not allow this. Instead in November 1815 he was sent up to Christ Church, Oxford; as an aristocrat he was automatically granted admission without examination. He left in his third year—aristocrats with no academic bent were released after only two years—but despite showing some aptitude, he did not take a degree.|$|E
5|$|By 1675 George's eldest {{uncle had}} died without issue, but his {{remaining}} two uncles had married, putting George's inheritance in jeopardy as his uncles' estates might pass {{to their own}} sons, should they have had any, instead of to George. George's father took him hunting and riding, and introduced him to military matters; <b>mindful</b> <b>of</b> his uncertain future, Ernest Augustus took the fifteen-year-old George on campaign in the Franco-Dutch War with the deliberate purpose of testing and training his son in battle.|$|E

5|$|In 1867, Rubinstein {{handed over}} the {{directorship}} of the Conservatory to Zaremba.

Tchaikovsky had already promised his Characteristic Dances (then called Dances of the Hay Maidens) from his opera The Voyevoda to the society. In submitting the manuscript (and perhaps <b>mindful</b> <b>of</b> Cui's review of the cantata), Tchaikovsky included a note to Balakirev that ended with a request for a word of encouragement should the Dances not be performed.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant-Governor John C. Bowen, <b>mindful</b> <b>of</b> {{the federal}} government's {{disallowance}} of the Social Credit Board's earlier legislation, reserved royal assent {{of the act}} and its companions until their legality could be tested at the Supreme Court of Canada. This was the first use {{of the power of}} reservation in Alberta history, and in the summer of 1938 Aberhart's government announced the elimination of Bowen's official residence, his government car, and his secretarial staff. Aberhart biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller and Ernest Manning biographer Brian Brennan attribute this move to revenge for Bowen's reservation of assent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mindful</b> <b>of</b> {{the long}} time {{required}} to bring the 777X to the market, Boeing continued to develop improvement packages which improve fuel efficiency, as well as lower prices for the existing product. As of February 2015, the backlog of undelivered 777s totals 278 aircraft, representing just under three years of current production at 8.3 aircraft per month, causing Boeing to ponder the 2018-2020 time frame. In January 2015, United Airlines ordered 10 Boeing 777-300ERs, normally costing around $150 million each but paid around $130 million, a discount to bridge the production gap to the 777X.|$|E

Joseph Kennedy had a national network of contacts and became a vocal supporter, building McCarthy's popularity among Catholics and making sizable contributions to McCarthy's campaigns. The Kennedy patriarch hoped {{that one of his}} sons would be president. <b>Mindful</b> <b>of</b> the anti-Catholic prejudice Al Smith faced during his 1928 campaign for that office, Joseph Kennedy supported McCarthy as a national Catholic politician who might pave the way for a younger Kennedy's presidential candidacy.|$|E

Boyle was unavailable, as were Horan and Massie who had toured in 1882, while Alexander, Cooper and Midwinter were no longer in contention for places.

5|$|When the Roman fleet reached Africa, {{a council}} was held aboard Belisarius' {{flagship}} (The Vandalic War, I.15), {{where many of}} his officers advocated an immediate attack on Carthage itself, especially since {{it was the only}} fortified city in the Vandal realm, the walls of the other cities having been torn down to prevent a rebellion. Belisarius, however, <b>mindful</b> <b>of</b> the fate of the 468 expedition and wary of an encounter with the Vandal fleet, spoke against it.

In addition, after the 8 -week course was complete, the participants answered a course reflection questionnaire. We hypothesized that the participants would show a substantial improvement in their <b>mindful</b> awareness <b>of</b> their moment-to-moment experiences.|$|R

5|$|Adult giant otters {{living in}} family groups have no known serious natural predators, however {{there are some}} {{accounts}} of black caimans in Peru and yacare caimans in the Pantanal preying on giant otters. In addition, solitary animals and young may be vulnerable to attacks by the jaguar, cougar, and anaconda, but {{this is based on}} historical reports, not direct observation. Pups are more vulnerable, and may be taken by caiman and other large predators, although adults are constantly <b>mindful</b> <b>of</b> stray young, and will harass and fight off possible predators. When in the water, the giant otter faces danger from animals not strictly preying upon it: the electric eel and stingray are potentially deadly if stumbled upon, and piranha may be capable of at least taking bites out of a giant otter, as evidenced by scarring on individuals.|$|E
5|$|Although she {{had long}} broken her formal ties with the British Communist Party, Wilkinson {{retained}} strong links with other communist organisations at home and abroad. Her association with leading communists such as Willi Münzenberg and Otto Katz is revealed in British intelligence files held on her. However, she {{was not prepared to}} risk losing her parliamentary seat, and thus kept her rebellious behaviour within bounds. In 1937 Wilkinson was {{one of a group of}} Labour figures—Aneurin Bevan, Harold Laski and Stafford Cripps were others—who founded the left-wing magazine Tribune; in the first issue she wrote of the need to fight unemployment, poverty, malnutrition and inadequate housing. <b>Mindful</b> <b>of</b> the dependence of many low-income families on credit, she introduced a bill to regulate hire purchase agreements, at the time a subject of frequent abuse, and with all-party support she secured the passage of the Hire Purchase Act 1938.|$|E
5|$|Behind the scenes, Welensky and the Rhodesians {{had been}} courting the Conservatives, while the native Africans {{had been doing}} the same with Labour.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{the current state of}} art in {{mindfulness}} research on workplace and identi 9 es some of the necessary steps and risks in the creation <b>of</b> <b>mindful</b> leadership theory. Mindfulness has the potential to e = ectively address three topical organizational challenges of growing demands on adaptability, prevailing issues of work-related stress and the necessity to raise the moral level in organizations. Current studies seem to suitably respond to the issues of work-related stress; however, the challenges of adaptability and morality so far lack appropriate empirical validation. Lack of empirical support is also noticeable in the case <b>of</b> <b>mindful</b> leadership theory as most studies still focus solely on individual leader development. However, it is important to start to discuss the suitable core variables <b>of</b> <b>mindful</b> leadership now as a clear di = erentiation from other leadership approaches like authentic leadership will be crucial for successful creation <b>of</b> <b>mindful</b> leadership theory. This paper also presents recommendations for entrepreneurs and managers willing to incorporate mindfulness into their organizational settings...|$|R
5|$|Demosthenes {{tailored}} {{his style}} {{to be very}} audience-specific. He took pride in not relying on attractive words but rather simple, effective prose. He was <b>mindful</b> <b>of</b> his arrangement, he used clauses to create patterns that would make seemingly complex sentences easy for the hearer to follow. His tendency to focus on delivery promoted him to use repetition, this would ingrain the importance into the audience's minds; he also relied on speed and delay to create suspense and interest among the audience when presenting to most important aspects of his speech. One of his most effective skills was his ability to strike a balance: his works were complex so that the audience would not be offended by any elementary language, {{but the most important}} parts were clear and easily understood.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} {{aftermath}} of these successes that Alcibiades resolved to finally return to Athens in the spring of 407 BC. Even {{in the wake of his}} recent victories, Alcibiades was exceedingly careful in his return, <b>mindful</b> <b>of</b> the changes in government, the charges still technically hanging over him, and the great injury he had done to Athens. Thus Alcibiades, instead of going straight home, first went to Samos to pick up 20 ships and proceeded with them to the Ceramic Gulf where he collected 100 talents. He finally sailed to Gytheion to make inquiries, partly about the reported preparations of the Spartans there, and partly about the feelings in Athens about his return. His inquiries assured him that the city was kindly disposed towards him and that his closest friends urged him to return.|$|E
