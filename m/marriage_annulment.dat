5000|$|... in this manner, the {{faithful}} can acquire {{a greater degree}} of moral certitude when an annulment is doubtful. Critics have interpreted this service as a usurping of the authority to dispense from marriage impediments and to declare <b>marriage</b> <b>annulments,</b> which belongs to the ordinary jurisdiction of diocesan bishops, and which would be schismatic in kind. This has led some priests to leave the SSPX.|$|R

25|$|This {{is below}} the {{replacement}} rate of 2.1, and also lower than in previous years. A 2002 study reported that urban women averaged 2.1 children per woman, with women living in rural areas having more children, at 2.9. As of the 1990s, both urban and rural women were averaging fewer children than previously. For those women who do have children, after former president Michelle Bachelet's childcare mandates, childcare centers that provide free services are four times more numerous.

50|$|However, {{there are}} some {{significant}} differences between divorce and annulment. Divorce is concerned merely with the legal effects of <b>marriage.</b> <b>Annulment,</b> however, is also concerned {{with the reality of}} whether or not a true marriage was ever formed. This leads to the second difference. At least in most countries, divorce is always possible. However, not all applications for marriage nullity are granted.|$|E

50|$|Divorce {{is not a}} {{possibility}} for the devotees of certain religious organizations. The Catholic Church, for example, does not permit its adherents to remarry after a divorce unless the marriage has been annulled. They also strongly discourage any legal divorce. <b>Marriage</b> <b>annulments,</b> however, are the current option for the followers of Catholicism to dissolve the official ties to their former significant other. The annulment, which renders a marriage null and void, can be sought on the bases of “adultery, pressure to marry, failure to consummate a marriage through vaginal intercourse, or a refusal to have children,” among other reasons. The Catholic Church considers couples that are divorced but have not been granted an annulment to still have a sacred bond of marriage even if legally divorced.|$|R

50|$|In 1536, the Church in England {{split from}} Rome {{over the issue}} of the divorce (technically, the <b>marriage</b> <b>annulment)</b> of King Henry VIII from Catherine of Aragon. The split led to the {{emergence}} of a separate ecclesiastical authority. Later the influence of the Reformation resulted in the Church of England adopting its distinctive reformed Catholic position known as Anglicanism which maintains episcopacy while adopting a Lutheran theology. For more detail of this period see the following article: Timeline of the English Reformation.|$|E
50|$|The Catholic Church has {{consistently}} taken the position that, while dissolution of a valid natural marriage, even if consummated, may be granted {{for the sake}} of someone's Christian faith ("in favorem fidei"), though not for other reasons, and that a valid sacramental marriage, if not consummated, may be dissolved, a valid sacramental consummated marriage is indissoluble. There is no divorce from such a marriage. However, what is referred to as a <b>marriage</b> <b>annulment</b> occurs when two competent ecclesiastical tribunals hand down concordant judgements that a particular marriage was not in fact a valid one.|$|E

Apparently, {{this was not a}} happy union from the outset as the marriage ended in annulment. As a result of a <b>marriage</b> <b>annulment</b> rather than a divorce, in accordance with Matrimonial Causes Act 1857, both parties were free to marry again, which Helen in due course did when she married yet another stockbroker, Robert Vernet, in 1905.http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/index.html ...|$|E

5000|$|The Muslim Moors {{society in}} the Maghreb parts of the North Africa was {{traditionally}} (and still is, to some extent) stratified.
