5|$|The unused {{westbound}} tunnel {{was used}} during World War I to store {{art from the}} Victoria & Albert Museum and china from Buckingham Palace and, from 1927 to 1939, {{was used as a}} signalling school. During World War II it contained equipment to detect bombs falling in the River Thames which <b>might</b> <b>require</b> the emergency floodgates on the under-river tunnels to be closed.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1900 season, Philadelphia stars Napoleon Lajoie and Ed Delahanty {{held out}} of {{renewing}} their {{contracts with the}} team. Other {{members of the team}} had grown disgruntled. Amid talk of a revival of the American Association, Flick and several other players began to talk about not returning to the team the next year. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Flick's father was in the chair business in Cleveland and that he <b>might</b> <b>require</b> Flick's help with the business. Flick agreed to a contract extension before the season started.|$|E
5|$|During the {{southern}} party's absence the relief ship Morning arrived, bringing fresh supplies. The expedition's organisers {{had assumed that}} the Discovery would be free from the ice in early 1903, enabling Scott to carry out further seaborne exploration and survey work before winter set in. It was intended that Discovery would return to New Zealand in March or April, then home to England via the Pacific, continuing its magnetic survey en route. Morning would provide any assistance that Scott <b>might</b> <b>require</b> during this period.|$|E

5|$|The {{convention}} {{spent several}} weeks in August in debating {{the powers of}} Congress. Although Mason was successful {{in some of his}} proposals, such as placing the state militias under federal regulation, and a ban on Congress passing an export tax, he lost on some that he deemed crucial. These losses included the convention deciding to allow importation of slaves to continue to at least 1800 (later amended to 1808) and to allow a simple majority to pass navigation acts that <b>might</b> <b>require</b> Virginians to export their tobacco in American-flagged ships, when it might be cheaper to use foreign-flagged vessels. The convention also weakened the requirement that money bills begin in the House and not be subject to amendment in the Senate, eventually striking the latter clause after debate that stretched fitfully over weeks. Despite these defeats, Mason continued to work constructively to build a constitution, serving on another grand committee that considered customs duties and ports.|$|E

50|$|Initially, nüzül {{was seen}} as an {{alternative}} to avarız; nuzul was (in principle) a payment of food, in kind. In times of war, villages <b>might</b> be <b>required</b> to supply food to army supply points, or they <b>might</b> be <b>required</b> to supply cash; but never both. Over time, this relationship changed, and both might be demanded (whilst nüzül also became a cash tax).|$|R
50|$|Passive grid {{design is}} ideal for audio {{equipment}}, because audio equipment must be more broadband than RF equipment. A RF device <b>might</b> be <b>required</b> to operate over the range 144 to 146 MHz (1.4% of an octave) while an audio amp <b>might</b> be <b>required</b> to operate over the range 20 Hz to 20 kHz, a range of three orders of magnitude.|$|R

25|$|It {{is unclear}} what {{cognitive}} abilities {{are necessary for}} an animal to exhibit tactical deception. It <b>might</b> <b>require</b> the ability to understand another animal's point of view, or it <b>might</b> <b>require</b> only the use of specialized learned behaviours. These alternatives are hotly debated, and the answer tends to {{vary depending on the}} species being observed. In the first scenario, the deceiver would need a Theory of Mind which is the ability to attribute mental states (beliefs, knowledge, intents, desires, etc.) to another individual, The alternative view denies the need for such a capacity, but it does suggest the evolution of specialized brain functions responsible for social learning.|$|E
25|$|Nationalists deplore {{the fact}} that so many people are {{stateless}} or live under inefficient and tyrannical regimes. Advocates of the society of states are concerned about rogue states and about the imperial ambitions of the powerful. Cosmopolitans believe that the contemporary world badly fails to live up to their standards, and that doing so would require considerable changes in the actions of wealthy individuals and states. It might, for instance, require them to transfer most of their wealth to the poor. It <b>might</b> <b>require</b> the building of international institutions able to limit, or even replace, the self-interested action of powerful states and corporations. It <b>might</b> <b>require</b> each of us to do much more than most now do.|$|E
25|$|It was {{estimated}} that after attaining 21 GW from nuclear power by 2020, further growth <b>might</b> <b>require</b> imported uranium. This is problematic because deployment of third stage requires that 50 GW be already established {{through the first}} and second stages.|$|E
50|$|Another {{class of}} civilians were {{required}} {{to serve in the}} military which included going on campaigns. Depending on one's wealth, one would be required to render different sorts of service, and “the richer the man was, the greater was his military obligation for service”. For example, if rich, one <b>might</b> be <b>required</b> as a knight. Or one <b>might</b> be <b>required</b> to provide a number of fighting men.|$|R

25|$|HBGary Federal {{had been}} set up with Aaron Barr as CEO instead of Hoglund to provide {{services}} and tools to the US government, which <b>might</b> <b>require</b> security clearance. As HBGary Federal could not meet revenue projections, in early 2011 negotiations about the sale of HBGary Federal were in progress with two interested companies.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{complications}} to a labiaplasty procedure are uncommon, yet occasional complications — bleeding, infection, labial asymmetry, poor wound-healing, undercorrection, overcorrection — do occur, and <b>might</b> <b>require</b> {{a revision}} surgery. An over-aggressive resection might damage the nerves, causing painful neuromas. Performing a flap-technique labiaplasty occasionally presents {{a greater risk}} for necrosis of the labia minora tissues.|$|E
25|$|For first-order tableaux without unification, the {{condition}} of fairness is similar, with the exception that the rule for universal quantifier <b>might</b> <b>require</b> more than one application. Fairness amounts to expanding every universal quantifier infinitely often. In other words, a fair policy of application of rules cannot keep applying other rules without expanding every universal quantifier in every branch that is still open once in a while.|$|E

25|$|Even {{after the}} {{development}} of powered aircraft, gliders have been built for research, where the lack of powerplant reduces complexity and construction costs and speeds development, particularly where new and poorly understood aerodynamic ideas are being tested that <b>might</b> <b>require</b> significant airframe changes. Examples have included delta wings, flying wings, lifting bodies and other unconventional lifting surfaces where existing theories were not sufficiently developed to estimate full scale characteristics.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Robert Metcalfe, {{one of the}} co-inventors of Ethernet, said he {{believed}} commercial applications using Terabit Ethernet may occur by 2015, though it <b>might</b> <b>require</b> new Ethernet standards. It was predicted this would be followed rapidly by a scaling to 100 Terabit, possibly as early as 2020. It {{is worth noting that}} these were theoretical predictions of technological ability, rather than estimates of when such speeds would actually become available at a practical price point.|$|E
25|$|Neuroimaging is not {{indicated}} {{for patients}} with stable headaches which are diagnosed as migraine. Studies indicate that presence of migraine does not increase a patient's risk for intracranial disease. A diagnosis of migraine which notes the absence of other problems, such as papilledema, would not indicate a need for neuroimaging. In the course of conducting a careful diagnosis, the physician should consider whether the headache has a cause other than the migraine and <b>might</b> <b>require</b> neuroimaging.|$|E

25|$|This type is {{the most}} basic, but {{can be a good}} choice for hard rock, multi-laterals and {{underbalance}} drilling. It involves leaving the productive reservoir section without any tubulars. This effectively removes control of flow of fluids from the formation; it is not suitable for weaker formations which <b>might</b> <b>require</b> sand control, nor for formations requiring selective isolation of oil, gas and water intervals. However, advances in interventions such as coiled tubing and tractors means that barefoot wells can be successfully produced.|$|E
25|$|The {{correction}} of capsular contracture <b>might</b> <b>require</b> an open capsulotomy (surgical release) of the collagen-fiber capsule, or the removal, and possible replacement, {{of the breast}} implant. Furthermore, in treating capsular contracture, the closed capsulotomy (disruption via external manipulation) once was a common maneuver for treating hard capsules, but now is a discouraged technique, because it can rupture the breast implant. Non-surgical treatments for collagen-fiber capsules include massage, external ultrasonic therapy, leukotriene pathway inhibitors such as zafirlukast (Accolate) or montelukast (Singulair), and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMFT).|$|E
25|$|A mild {{form of a}} {{cleft lip}} is a {{microform}} cleft. A microform cleft can appear {{as small as a}} little dent in the red part of the lip or look like a scar from the lip up to the nostril. In some cases muscle tissue in the lip underneath the scar is affected and <b>might</b> <b>require</b> reconstructive surgery. It is advised to have newborn infants with a microform cleft checked with a craniofacial team as soon as possible to determine the severity of the cleft.|$|E
