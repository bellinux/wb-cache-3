5|$|The NBA {{relocation}} committee {{gave its}} {{approval for the}} move to Memphis in late June, and on July 3 the Board of Governors unanimously approved the relocation. This also permitted Hyde to purchase a <b>minority</b> <b>share</b> of the franchise. By then the team administration had already relocated, and {{the day before the}} final decision, the team set up its rookie camp at Rhodes College. A relocation party was held on July 7. A week before the move, the Grizzlies traded away two of the top players, Shareef Abdur-Rahim and guard Mike Bibby, who therefore never played for Memphis.|$|E

25|$|Most {{of these}} ventures are now extinct. The European one that lasted longest was the lorries arm of Ford of Britain, which {{became part of}} the Iveco group in 1986. Ford had a <b>minority</b> <b>share</b> in the new company and Iveco took over sales and {{production}} of the Ford Cargo range. Ford's last significant European truck models were the Transcontinental and the Cargo.|$|E
25|$|The Concrete Herald {{has also}} changed its {{political}} affiliation to 'independent' and increased its subscription price to $1.50. Its paid circulation, however, fell sharply from 870 copies in Bratlie's years to 330 copies in 1920. By 1922 the circulation rebounded slightly to 462 copies., and Webster sold his {{share in the}} newspaper to A.J. Collins.

25|$|At {{the time}} of BVT's creation, VT Group was {{expected}} to eventually sell its <b>minority</b> <b>share</b> to BAE Systems through a put option, but not within three years. However, on 28 January 2009 VT Group announced its intention to sell its share. VT Group's put option valued its share at a minimum of £380million subject to conditions; however it received £346 million after various payments to BAE. In addition, VT Group agreed to pay £43 million compensation to BVT for cost overruns on contracts with Trinidad & Tobago and Oman that BVT had inherited from VT Shipbuilding. VT Group's net proceeds {{from the sale of}} its share in BVT to BAE Systems were therefore £303 million.|$|E
25|$|Under CRTC rules, cable {{companies}} cannot offer a new American service if a comparable Canadian service already exists. However, if a Canadian equivalent begins operations after an American service {{has already been}} added to cable packages, the cable company {{is not required to}} discontinue the American service. (For example, Canadian {{cable companies}} cannot offer MTV, as the station was not yet available in Canada when MuchMusic began broadcasting in 1984. However, cable companies can offer CNN, as they were already offering that service when CBC Newsworld first aired in 1989.) The rules formerly required that the American service be removed if a Canadian equivalent is launched; this caused controversy when the US version of CMT was removed from the lineup when a new Canadian country music channel called the New Country Network launched. CMT had contested that this was a violation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Ultimately, Viacom purchased a <b>minority</b> <b>share</b> in the network, and rebranded it under the CMT name.|$|E
25|$|KTVT's {{popularity}} also spread {{outside of}} the Metroplex {{beginning in the late}} 1970s, when the station uplinked its signal to satellite. This attained it a new status as a superstation along the lines of WTBS (now WPCH-TV) in Atlanta, WGN-TV in Chicago and WOR-TV in New York City (now WWOR-TV in Secaucus, New Jersey); its signal was transmitted to about 400 cable systems and to C-band satellite subscribers across the country, mainly in the Southwestern U.S. At its height, the station was available on nearly every cable television provider in Texas and Oklahoma, as well as large swaths of Louisiana, Arkansas and New Mexico. However, its quasi-national distribution would later hamper OPUBCO president Edward L. Gaylord's efforts to purchase a controlling interest in the Texas Rangers (of which Gaylord purchased a <b>minority</b> <b>share</b> in 1985), as the other Major League Baseball team owners had concerns about a fourth team having widespread television coverage through a superstation (as WTBS already carried the Atlanta Braves, WGN-TV aired the Chicago Cubs and White Sox, and WWOR-TV held rights to the New York Mets at the time).|$|E

500|$|Bred in California, the chestnut-colored {{horse was}} named for his flashy white markings, called [...] "chrome" [...] by horse aficionados. He was bred and {{originally}} owned by Perry Martin from Yuba City, California, and Steve Coburn of Topaz Lake, Nevada, who named their partnership DAP Racing, standing for [...] "Dumb Ass Partners"—a tongue-in-cheek response to a passerby who questioned their wisdom in purchasing California Chrome's dam, Love the Chase. In 2015, Coburn sold his <b>minority</b> <b>share</b> to Taylor Made Farm, and a new ownership group, California Chrome, LLC, was formed. The horse is trained by the father–son team of Art and Alan Sherman. Dedicated fans—called [...] "Chromies"—actively supported California Chrome, who has been called [...] "the people's horse".|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Reeves Thoroughbred Racing {{bought out}} Dream Team One's 30-percent {{interest}} {{and became the}} sole owners of Mucho Macho Man. Later, Mike and Laura Sivo obtained a <b>minority</b> <b>share.</b> Also in 2012, the team added a permanent exercise rider to their roster: Ritvo's nephew, former jockey Nick Petro, Jr. [...] Petro actually rode Mucho Macho Man more than anyone else. A strong support staff also worked consistently with the horse, including assistant trainer Marcelino Valencia, stable groom Valietal Tapia, and hot walker Karina Lopez. [...] The horse's connections remained unchanged through 2013. [...] In February 2014, anticipating the stallion's future retirement to a stud career after the 2014 season, Adena Springs Farms purchased an interest in Mucho Macho Man, but he remained in training with the same team and raced under Reeves' colors. [...] Frank Stronach, noting that Adena arranged the mating between Macho Uno and Ponche de Leona, described the sale as [...] "a homecoming of sorts".|$|E

[...] He returned to a team that had only waded into even greater financial danger than before he left.

[...] One exception was Warren [...] "Fuzzy" [...] Anderson, Breadon's partner in the Pierce-Arrow dealership, who confided with him had more $15,000 invested in the Cardinals. [...] Anderson decided he, too, wanted to invest more in the Cardinals.

40|$|Focusing on {{takeover}} bids whose outcome can {{be predicted}} in advance with certainty, Grossman and Hart established the proposition, which subsequent work accepted, that successful bids must be made {{at or above the}} expected value of <b>minority</b> <b>shares.</b> This proposition provided the basis for Grossman and Hart's identification of a free-rider problem and became a major premise for the analysis of takeovers This paper shows that this important proposition does not always hold once we drop the assumption that the only successful bids are those whose success could have been predicted with certainty In particular, it is shown that any unconditional bid that is below the expected value of <b>minority</b> <b>shares</b> but above the independent target's per share value will succeed with a certain positive probability, that the bidder's expected payoff from such a bid (not counting the transaction costs of making the bid) is always positive; and that bidders might elect to make such bids. These results have implications for the nature of the free-rider problem and for the operation of takeovers; in particular, it is shown that, when a raider can increase the value of a target's assets, the raider might elect to bid even if no dilution of <b>minority</b> <b>shares</b> is possible and it holds no initial stake in the target...|$|R
