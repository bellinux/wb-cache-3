5|$|For a long time, {{sources of}} {{nitrogen}} compounds were limited. Natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions. Nitrogen fixation by industrial processes like the Frank–Caro process (1895–1899) and Haber–Bosch process (1908–1913) eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds, {{to the extent}} that half of global food production (see Applications) now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. At the same time, use of the Ostwald process (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> in the World Wars of the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|Francis Arthur Freeth [...] (2 January 1884 – 15 July 1970) was a British {{industrial}} chemist. He {{spent much}} of his career at Brunner Mond and its successor Imperial Chemical Industries, as chief chemist, research manager and in a recruiting capacity, with particular knowledge of phase rule chemistry, and developed many processes related to the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosives.</b> He made a critical contribution to the British World War I effort by devising new ways to manufacture ammonium nitrate, which was recognised with an honour, and a smaller contribution in World War II for the Special Operations Executive. Freeth created links between Brunner Mond and Dutch chemistry, particularly at the University of Leiden where he met Kammerlingh Onnes and was awarded a doctorate.|$|E

50|$|Production at Site S ceased in late 1945 due to {{the cold}} weather. By the time it became warmer, the Los Alamos Laboratory had lost so many staff that routine <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> lenses would have unacceptably {{hindered}} casting <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> for experimental purposes. All work was then done at Salt Wells. The plant was completed in January 1946, and all equipment was installed and working by May 1946. Work was initially dogged by an unacceptably large number of defects {{in the form of}} cracks or imperfections in the explosive blocks. The core of the problem was that the techniques used at Los Alamos did not scale to a production site, so different methods were required. Special instrumentation was devised by Caltech's Ira Bowen to assess the quality <b>of</b> the <b>explosive</b> blocks.|$|R
5000|$|Between 03:00 and 06:10 the {{following}} morning, forensic scientist, Dr Frank Skuse, conducted {{a series of}} Griess tests upon the hands, fingernails and belongings of the five men arrested at Heysham Port, to determine whether any of the men had handled nitroglycerine (an active ingredient in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> devices). Skuse concluded with a 99% degree of certainty that both Patrick Hill and William Power had handled explosives, and remained uncertain as to the test results conducted on John Walker, whose right hand had tested positive, but whose left hand had tested negative.

40|$|The Australian Government's {{expressed}} {{desire to}} inhibit {{the spread of}} nuclear weapons and its wish to prevent Australia's uranium exports being used for <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>explosives</b> are underwritten by Australia's formal international obligations. Australia is not free to export its material without paying due regard to supra-national requirements. This paper defines two safeguards regimes, one applying to countries such as Australia which are party to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the other to those which are not parties. The application of safeguards {{and the role of the}} International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are briefly explained. Australia's obligations under the NPT and those stemming from specific undertakings to the IAEA are stated. The latter require Australia to ensure that Non-Nuclear Weapons States not party to the NPT give assurances that Australian uranium will not be used for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>explosives</b> and that they will permit verification by the IAEA. These obligations give rise to a set of minimum conditions applying to exports of Australian uranium which vary according to the NPT status of the importing countries...|$|R
50|$|The {{patent rights}} for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> gun cotton were {{obtained}} by John Hall & Son in 1846, and industrial <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> the <b>explosive</b> began at a purpose-built factory at Faversham’s Marsh Works in Kent, England a year later. However, the manufacturing process was not properly understood and few safety measures were put in place. A serious explosion in July of that year killed almost two dozen workers, resulting in the immediate closure of the plant. Guncotton manufacture ceased for over 15 years until a safer procedure could be developed.|$|R
50|$|In 1940, a new Ministry of Supply factory (building 300) was {{constructed}} {{adjacent to the}} site for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> additive Centralite I.

50|$|During World War I Leslie {{worked on}} {{large-scale}} <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> in Liverpool.

5000|$|Oleum {{is used in}} the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> many <b>explosives</b> {{with the}} notable {{exception}} of nitrocellulose. [...] (In modern manufacturing of nitrocellulose, the H2SO4 concentration is often adjusted using oleum) The chemical requirements for explosives manufacture often call for anhydrous mixtures containing nitric acid and sulfuric acid. Ordinary commercial grade nitric acid consists of the constant boiling azeotrope of nitric acid and water, and contains 68% nitric acid. Mixtures of ordinary nitric acid in sulfuric acid therefore contain substantial amounts of water and are unsuitable for processes such as those that occur in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> trinitrotoluene.|$|R
