40|$|International audienceDan {{refers to}} a <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for {{capacity}} and a vessel often encountered {{in the management of}} grain during the Qin and the Western Han dynasties. It was only after Wang Mang that it was in general replaced by the hu. As the highest administrative <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for capacity, in Qin and Western Han times it was used in parallel with tong, the highest legal <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for capacity. The unit for capacity dan takes its origin in the regulation stating that 10 dou of “coarsely husked grain” and one weight unit dan of a cereal plant just harvested had equal values. This is why 10 dou of “coarsely husked grain” could be called 1 dan “standard husked grain. ” The small dan and the large dan were <b>measuring</b> <b>units</b> and vessels specific to the measurement of grain {{in the context of the}} rationing system used in the northern border area. During the Qin and the Western Han time periods, there already existed an absolute value unit “dan” which was neither a weight nor a capacity <b>measuring</b> <b>unit.</b> “Dan,” being originally a <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for weight, used to measure “cereal plants” just harvested, was pronounced zjya(k); however, since, from the viewpoint of its value, it was equivalent to the <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for capacity dan （担）used in the measurement of “standard husked grain”, the latter capacity <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> was also called dan“石”and pronounced ta(m). Simultaneously there occurred a “transformation in the pronunciation of “dan” (石) which was pronounced like dan （担). ” As a result, whether it meant a <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for weight or for capacity, “dan” (石) in both cases could at the time be pronounced as ta（m). This relates to the fact that today the <b>measuring</b> <b>units</b> for weight and capacity dan are also read in the same way...|$|R

50|$|A key {{difference}} between command staffing and unit deployment staffing is {{the requirement to}} stabilize a unit’s personnel {{for the duration of}} the deployment. Assignment efforts must identify replacements for Marines who cannot participate in the deployment either because of expiration of active service (EAS), permanent change of station (PCS) orders, or other circumstances. The important difference for the deploying unit is that, while these Marines are chargeable, they are non-deployable and therefore, must be replaced. The point at which the deployable versus chargeable distinction is made occurs, at a minimum, six months prior to embarkation; however, most assignments are initiated six months prior to the estimated date of arrival. Consequently, assignment monitors at HQMC will begin to <b>measure</b> <b>unit</b> deployment strengths as early as one year prior to deployment. Even though most assignments will be identified closer, commanders must recognize that deployment-related Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) entries have a critical impact on unit staffing during the predeployment period. Erroneous or missing information will result in an excessive administrative workload and may contribute to reduced personnel readiness or key billet shortages.|$|E

There are eight types of units, each with different properties: Infantry, Tank, Anti-Tank, Recon, Air Defense, Fighter, Artillery, and Bomber. Each unit is assigned a numerical value to represent its movement (in hexes); its {{line of sight}} (in hexes); its attack abilities against armored targets, unarmored targets, ships, and airplanes; its defense against ranged, close, and air attacks; as well as values for initiative and remaining ammunition and fuel. The final value, health, is represented by a number, usually 1 to 10. When attacking or defending, the unit receives experience points based {{on the amount of}} damage inflicted to its enemy (also some points are received when damage is caused by the enemy). Each 100 experience points correspond to one experience level (a value ranging from 0 to 5). When attaining a higher level, unit may also receive a famous leader, granting it some special abilities.

5000|$|According to the Parastaseis syntomoi chronikai (a Byzantine Guide of {{the city}} written in the 8th or 9th century), in the square lay also the edifice named Modius (Μόδιον, pr. [...] "Modion"). [...] This landmark, built {{in front of the}} house of a certain Krateros, had a central plan with columns bearing a vault topped by a pyramid. The {{building}} hosted a silver exemplar of the modius, the largest Roman dry <b>measure</b> <b>unit</b> and was used above all in the cereals trade. The exemplar on display was supposed to represent the standard for this unit in the Byzantine Empire. [...] The monument's façade hosted also two bronze hands set on spears. These were supposed to warn the wheat merchants against cheating using false measures: cheaters had their right hand cut, as happened in the 5th century to two sailors accused of having swindled the Emperor while selling him cereals. The monument's location was not accidental: the square was not far from the Egyptian and the Theodosian wheat deposits, both placed near the Harbour of Eleutherios. The Modius had been erected by Emperor Valentinian I (r. 364-375), who introduced this standard to Constantinople. A statue of him carrying a modius lay under the monument's vault. Over the years the original meaning of the bronze hands was forgotten and the place was actually used to punish criminals, often through mutilation.|$|E
