5|$|The control {{surfaces}} operated {{in much the}} same way as other aircraft, with the exception of the innovative automatic pull-out system. Releasing the bomb initiated the pull-out, or automatic recovery and climb, upon the deflection of the dive brakes. The pilot could override the system by exerting significant force on the control column and taking <b>manual</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized the spacecraft and slowly cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, {{and was able}} to position the capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating slowly past, but made no attempt to move towards it. As the spacecraft moved across the Atlantic, he turned his attention to testing <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> of the spacecraft, which he found sloppy compared to the fly-by-wire system.|$|E

25|$|Innovia Metro {{systems are}} {{normally}} fully automated and driven under computer control from a centralized office. However, the Toronto Transit Commission union ATU Local113, rejected this operational option for its Scarborough Rapid Transit (SRT) and the vehicles were modified at high cost to include operator cabins and conventional controls {{as they were}} afraid of the TTC cutting jobs. No other Innovia Metro system uses <b>manual</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{digital and}} solid state Type 726-4 decoy {{launcher}} system {{is mounted on}} the forward deck and consists of four launchers. Each launcher has 18 tubes arranged in three six-tube rows. Firing is typically controlled automatically by the combat data system, but a <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> console is also provided. The decoy launcher system may theoretically be linked to other subsystems, although whether this feature is incorporated in the Type 052C is unknown.|$|E
25|$|These {{operate in}} an {{identical}} manner as the floor mounted shift lever {{when it is}} placed across the gate in manual mode. The paddle shifters have two distinct advantages: the driver can safely keep {{both hands on the}} steering wheel when using the Manual/tiptronic mode; and the driver can temporarily manually override either of the automatic programmes (D or S), and gain instant <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> of the DSG transmission (within the above described constraints).|$|E

25|$|The first Type 192 {{prototype}} XG447 flew on 5 July 1958 with tandem wooden rotor blades, {{a completely}} <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> {{system and a}} castored, fixed quadricycle undercarriage. From the fifth prototype, the rotors fitted were all-metal, four-bladed units. Production model controls and instruments allowed night operations. The prototype machines had an upwards-hinged main passenger and cockpit door, which was prone to being slammed shut by the downwash from the rotors. This {{was replaced by a}} sliding door on the later aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Dragon Quest IV {{was later}} re-released for the Nintendo DS in Japan in November 2007. The game has been remade into a 2D/3D hybrid, {{similar to the}} PlayStation version. This release has kept many of the {{enhancements}} from the PlayStation, such as the slightly altered immigrant town, but has received enhanced upgrades to smooth the graphics further, and improved sound. This release also allows players to take <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> of all of their party members {{in the final two}} chapters.|$|E
25|$|Note: {{the above}} all {{function}} like 2WD when multi-plate clutch coupling is not engaged (with exception of Subaru models), and like 4WD highrange in a part-time 4WD system when the clutch is engaged (usually by computer although some allow <b>manual</b> <b>control).</b> Some {{in this category}} have varying degrees of control in the torque distribution between front and rear by allowing some of the clutches in a multi-plate clutch coupling to engage and slip varying amounts. An example of a system like this is the BorgWarner i-Trac(TM) system.|$|E
50|$|The Great and Choir manuals {{have been}} {{enlarged}} to seven octaves so that specially extended {{stops in the}} pedal can be played throughout the 85 note compass of both manuals. These stops can be selected by stop-keys in two divisions in the right stop jamb. The Grand Great (for the Great <b>Manual)</b> <b>controls</b> stops from the Pedal Right and the Grand Choir (for the Choir <b>Manual)</b> <b>controls</b> stops from the Pedal Left. For example, the Grand Ophicleide can be played from the pedalboard, {{but also from the}} Great manual by means of the Grand Great.|$|R
5000|$|Griddles with <b>manual</b> <b>controls</b> require {{constant}} {{attention by}} an operator {{to control the}} temperature of the griddle plate. Without food products to remove the heat from a griddle surface, the unregulated heat source can cause the plate surface temperature to rise continuously until it levels out at temperatures well beyond those normally used for cooking (over [...] ). At these temperatures the griddle plate material may take on a bluish tint as the surface of the carbon steel plate oxidizes. <b>Manual</b> <b>controls</b> are not typically used on electric griddles.|$|R
50|$|It's a 4 MP {{model with}} 4x optical zoom lens and has many <b>manual</b> <b>controls.</b> Like its predecessors, it takes sharp photos (though some claim the 995 is sharper) {{and has a}} long shutter lag.|$|R
25|$|Once a {{fault is}} detected, the circuit breaker {{contacts}} must open {{to interrupt the}} circuit; This is commonly done using mechanically stored energy contained within the breaker, such as a spring or compressed air to separate the contacts. Circuit breakers may also use the higher current caused by the fault to separate the contacts, such as thermal expansion or a magnetic field. Small circuit breakers typically have a <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> lever to switch off the load or reset a tripped breaker, while larger units use solenoids to trip the mechanism, and electric motors to restore energy to the springs.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Lockheed Constellation L-049 {{aircraft}} allowed the pilots to disable the hydraulic elevator boost and control the elevators manually via direct mechanical linkage. The pilots of the accident flight apparently attempted to revert to <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> as the aircraft began to pitch up, but the design was such that a continuous nose down pressure on the elevators made the shift to manual elevator control mechanically impossible. Thus, according to the CAB's reconstruction of events, as the pilots were desperately applying nose down pressure to avoid a stall, they were also hampering themselves from shifting to manual mode and regaining elevator control.|$|E
25|$|The LOKh fire {{suppression}} system aboard Nerpa was reportedly of a new type that had not previously been used aboard any Russian submarine. Earlier versions of the LOKh system only operate under <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> from the duty shift console. The new system installed on Nerpa could also operate in automatic mode, responding to smoke and rises in compartment temperature and activating individually in each compartment. According to the testimony of an engineer from the Zvezda shipyard, this had malfunctioned before while the submarine was being readied for its sea trials. Some commentators speculated that the system could have been accidentally activated by cigarette smoke.|$|E

40|$|Many {{previous}} research {{studies have found}} that the operation of in-vehicle systems while on-the-move using traditional <b>manual</b> <b>controls</b> (buttons, switches etc.) can adversely affect driving performance. It has been proposed that voice operation can reduce these effects by allowing the eyes to remain on the road, and the hands to remain on tix steering wheel. A counter-argument tu the incorporation of voice control is that, by mounting <b>manual</b> <b>controls</b> on or near the steering wheel, similar benefits can be experienced. To examine these arguments, a study was designed to compare different types of control for operating au in-car entertainment (ICE) system, incorporating radio, tape and CD functions. Thirty two participants carried ant tasks using either (i) standwd <b>manual</b> ICE <b>controls,</b> (ii) <b>manual</b> steering wheel button controls, (iii) voice controls with spoken and visual feedback, or (iv) voice controls with no feedback. The ICE war operated alone, or while carrying out a simultaneous PC-based driving task using steering wheel and pedals. Driving performance was found to be significantly better while using voice <b>controls</b> than the <b>manual</b> <b>controls.</b> Transaction times while driving were shortest for the standard controls, intermediate for the voice conditions, and longest for the steering wheel controls. Subjectively, the voice controls with feedback were rated easiest, most likable, and most efficient to use while driving...|$|R
25|$|For mission safety, {{weeks before}} the manned mission on LK lander, an LK-R lander in {{unmanned}} L3 lunar expedition complex and two Lunokhod automated rovers {{would be sent to}} the Moon for preliminary study of surface around LK-R and LK sites, for work as radio beacons for precision landings of LK-R and LK, and for visual estimate of status of them. LK-R used as a reserve escape craft in case of disability to start from Moon of LK and Lunokhods used by cosmonaut for transfer to LK-R in necessity and for regular research. This manned version of Lunokhod were additionally equipped with oxygen stock with hose socket, standing pads and <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> for the cosmonaut in front part.|$|E
25|$|Type 76A twin 37mm gun {{was thus}} {{developed}} {{to solve these}} problems by introducing an enclosed turret and fire control systems. A fire control radar guides these weapons, and can engage targets in most conditions. There is also an optronic device that enables manual and optical aiming. The Type 76F is a Type 76A system with simplified fire control system, which has the electrooptic system but not the radar. Also, there is a console for one human operator inside the gun mount for local <b>manual</b> <b>control,</b> though the gun can be fully automated. Unlike the old manual mounts that require a full crew of men to steer, aim, load, and fire the weapon, the Type 76F requires only one operator to aim the system. In addition to the 37mm guns, a number of Russian AK-230 were also purchased and reverse engineered (as Type 69) for small boats.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that a high void {{coefficient}} does not necessarily make a reactor inherently unsafe, as some of the fission neutrons are emitted with a delay of seconds or even minutes (post-fission neutron emission from daughter nuclei), so steps can be taken to reduce the fission rate before it gets too high. However, it does make it considerably harder to control the reactor (especially at low power) and makes it imperative that the control systems are very reliable and the control room personnel (regardless of rank or position) are rigorously trained in the peculiarities and limits of the system. Neither of these requirements were in place at Chernobyl: since the reactor's actual design bore the approval stamp of the Kurchatov Institute and was considered a state secret, discussion of the reactor's flaws was forbidden, even among the actual personnel operating the plant. Some later RBMK designs did include control rods on electromagnetic grapples, thus controlling the reaction speed and, if necessary, stopping the reaction completely. The RBMK at Chernobyl, however, had <b>manual</b> <b>control</b> rods.|$|E
