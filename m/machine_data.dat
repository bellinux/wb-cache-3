500|$|F-Zero AX {{cabinets}} can dispense {{magnetic stripe}} cards called a [...] "F-Zero license card" [...] {{to keep track}} of custom <b>machine</b> <b>data,</b> pilot points, and race data. A card was bundled with the Japanese release of F-Zero GX. The card expires after fifty uses, but its data can be transferred to a new card. Once inserted, the game builds a machine with three custom parts which can be upgraded by earning pilot points. Pilot points are acquired as the player progresses through the Race and Time Attack modes. Players can increase point earnings by improving finish place, eliminating opponents, and finishing races with a large amount of energy reserved. A magnetic stripe card is needed to enter the F-Zero AX Internet Ranking system. Similarly to GX, players receive a password after completing a Time Attack race to enter on the official F-Zero website's ranking system.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe process {{planning}} {{plays an important}} role in the machining process of a part, whose quality will influence the quality of product. However, the {{process planning}} mainly depends on human experiences which result in low level degree of automation and intelligence for a long period. Furthermore, the efficiency and quality of process planning cannot be guaranteed. To address the problems above, an intelligent process planning method based on feature-based history <b>machining</b> <b>data</b> is proposed for aircraft structural parts. The history <b>machining</b> <b>data</b> model is built firstly according to the characteristic of aircraft structural parts. Then the intelligent process planning is realized based on the history <b>machining</b> <b>data</b> model by considering the resource constraint, process constraint and result constraint. An application example shows that the proposed approach can accumulate machining experience effectively and improve the efficiency and quality of process planning, as well as the degree of automation and intelligence...|$|R

As a kind of common machining method, milling is also favor in the micro-fabrication field since its good machining precision and forming ability. In this work, cutting process simulation of micro-milling was done to analyze the influence of <b>machining</b> <b>data</b> and tool geometry on the cutting process such as temperature and stress distribution during machining by using ABAQUS software.

40|$|<b>Machining</b> <b>data</b> {{handbooks}} {{are important}} reference {{books in the}} machining industry, as they provide recommended process parameter values for common machining operations. The <b>machining</b> <b>data,</b> although covering {{a wide range of}} relevant cutting conditions, are only listed under discrete cutting conditions. Rough interpolation-based calculations are often needed in order to estimate the process parameter values at the desired cutting condition. In this work, a composite fitting model is presented to fit a composite functional curve through the discrete handbook data of recommended cutting speeds and feeds with respect to the cutting condition of radial depth of cut for peripheral end milling. The objective is to establish a functional relationship from the handbook data such that recommended cutting speed and feed can be obtained for any given radial depth of cut. According to the tabulated layout of the <b>machining</b> <b>data,</b> the entire range of the radial depth of cut is divided into three segments having distinctive formulations and trends. Constraints are then imposed to preserve the trends and smoothly connect the adjacent segments. As a possible application of the presented model, a case study of machining a rectangular pocket is provided. Machining time of a potential process plan is readily evaluated based on the cutting speeds and feeds obtained from the composite model. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSustainability {{assessment}} {{is becoming an}} unquestionable issue for manufacturing companies that are urged by governments and customers to provide environment-friendly products. Machining, {{as one of the}} major manufacturing operations, has high potential factors regarding the environmental impacts of production system. Nevertheless, environmental assessments are mainly done post-product design and post-machining processes design. Integrating environmental assessment in the machining processes design could lead to significant improvements in sustainable manufacturing field. Major difficulties to perform such an assessment are the availability of the <b>machining</b> <b>data</b> and the lack of calculation rules to express them in terms of environmental impacts. This article presents a new approach based on the STandard for the Exchange of Product model data—compliant Numerical Control to integrate the machining environmental assessment in the earlier design phases.

40|$|Abstract—Fuzzy {{logic is}} a {{mathematical}} theory of inexact reasoning {{that allows us}} to model the reasoning process of humans in linguistic terms. It is very suitable in defining the relationship between the system inputs and the desired system outputs. This paper presents fuzzy logic models to select machining parameters (cutting speed and feed rate) in automated process planning (CAPP) systems. Each model utilizes two-input and two-output variables which are partitioned into several fuzzy sets according to their minimum and maximum values allowed to control the model. A set of fuzzy rules have been constructed for each model, based on the knowledge extracted from <b>machining</b> <b>data</b> handbooks. Once the rules are evaluated the variables are defuzzified and converted into the corresponding output variables (cutting speed and feed rate). An example is given to demonstrate and verify the application of the developed fuzzy models. The results obtained are compared with the corresponding ones obtained from <b>machining</b> <b>data</b> handbook and shown good fit.
