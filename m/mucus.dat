5|$|At the tapered {{rear end}} of the stomach and {{projecting}} slightly into the hindgut is the prostyle, a backward-pointing cone of feces and <b>mucus,</b> which is rotated by further cilia so it acts as a bobbin, winding the <b>mucus</b> string onto itself. Before the <b>mucus</b> string reaches the prostyle, the acidity of the stomach makes the <b>mucus</b> less sticky and frees particles from it.|$|E
5|$|Paranemertes peregrina, which {{feeds on}} polychaetes, {{can follow the}} prey's trails of <b>mucus,</b> and find its burrow by {{backtracking}} along its own trail of <b>mucus.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{cervical}} <b>mucus</b> plug, {{called the}} operculum, forms inside the cervical canal during pregnancy. This provides a protective seal for the uterus against {{the entry of}} pathogens and against leakage of uterine fluids. The <b>mucus</b> plug is also known to have antibacterial properties. This plug is released as the cervix dilates, either during {{the first stage of}} childbirth or shortly before. It is visible as a blood-tinged mucous discharge.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. <b>Mucus</b> production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess <b>mucus.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the head}} has largely {{disappeared}} in bivalves, the mouth has been equipped with labial palps (two {{on each side}} of the mouth) to collect the detritus from its <b>mucus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Preservation of most {{specimens}} {{was made}} possible by the fast sedimentation that quickly cut the organism off from seawater; it may also have been enhanced by the decay products of the rotting organism, which could have helped the overlying sediment to mineralise and harden. It has been suggested that a <b>mucus</b> trail produced by the organism may have assisted its preservation, but experiments suggest that <b>mucus</b> disintegrates too easily {{to play a role in}} binding sediment together.|$|E
5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of Cornu aspersum, shows {{that it is not}} the mechanical action of the dart that increases paternity in sperm donors but instead the <b>mucus</b> that coats the dart. The <b>mucus</b> carries an allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snail’s hemolymph when the dart is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the female component of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the bursa copulax (sperm digestion organ) is closed off, and the copulatory canal (leading to the sperm storage) is opened. This reconfiguration allows more sperm to access the sperm storage area and fertilize eggs, rather than being digested. Ultimately this increases the shooter’s paternity.|$|E
5|$|Puyoda (water of pus): Shudras (workmen-caste) {{and husbands}} or sexual {{partners}} of lowly women and prostitutes – who live like animals devoid of cleanliness and good behaviour – fall in Puyoda, the ocean of pus, excreta, urine, <b>mucus,</b> saliva and other repugnant things. Here, {{they are forced}} to eat these disgusting things.|$|E
5|$|The {{degree of}} {{ovulation}} suppression in progestogen-only contraceptives {{depends on the}} progestogen activity and dose. Low dose progestogen-only contraceptives—traditional progestogen only pills, subdermal implants Norplant and Jadelle, and intrauterine system Mirena—inhibit ovulation in about 50% of cycles and rely mainly on other effects, such as thickening of cervical <b>mucus,</b> for their contraceptive effectiveness. Intermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives—the progestogen-only pill Cerazette and the subdermal implant Nexplanon—allow some follicular development but more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97–99% of cycles. The same cervical <b>mucus</b> changes occur as with very low-dose progestogens. High-dose, progestogen-only contraceptives—the injectables Depo-Provera and Noristerat—completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouth is}} {{at the base of}} the lophophore. Food passes through the mouth, muscular pharynx ("throat") and {{oesophagus}} ("gullet"), all of which are lined with cilia and cells that secrete <b>mucus</b> and digestive enzymes. The stomach wall has branched ceca ("pouches") where food is digested, mainly within the cells.|$|E
5|$|Adults of {{different}} species infest {{different parts of}} the definitive host, for example the intestine, lungs, large blood vessels, and liver. The adults use a relatively large, muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, <b>mucus,</b> body fluids or blood. In both the adults and the stages that live in snails, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.|$|E
5|$|After {{menstruation}} {{and directly}} {{under the influence of}} estrogen, the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open in response to the higher levels of estrogen present. These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical <b>mucus,</b> described below.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{this ability}} to digest food outside the body, starfish can hunt prey much larger than their mouths. Their diets include clams and oysters, arthropods, small fish and {{gastropod}} molluscs. Some starfish are not pure carnivores, supplementing their diets with algae or organic detritus. Some of these species are grazers, but others trap food particles from the water in sticky <b>mucus</b> strands that are swept towards the mouth along ciliated grooves.|$|E
5|$|Ceriantharia {{comprises}} the related tube-dwelling anemones. Tube-dwelling anemones or cerianthids look {{very similar to}} sea anemones, but belong to an entirely different subclass of anthozoans. They are solitary, living buried in soft sediments. Tube anemones live and can withdraw into tubes, which are made of a fibrous material, which is made from secreted <b>mucus</b> and threads of nematocyst-like organelles, known as ptychocysts.|$|E
5|$|If left untreated, DPB {{progresses}} to bronchiectasis, an irreversible {{lung condition}} that involves {{enlargement of the}} bronchioles, and pooling of <b>mucus</b> in the bronchiolar passages. Daily treatment of DPB with macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin eases symptoms and increases survival time, but the disease currently has no known cure. The eventual result of DPB can be respiratory failure and heart problems.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation is {{a normal}} part of the human immune response, whereby leukocytes (white blood cells), {{including}} neutrophils (white blood cells that specialize in causing inflammation), gather, and chemokines (proteins released from certain cells, which activate or elicit a response from other cells) accumulate at any location in the body where bacterial or viral infections occur. Inflammation interferes with the activity of bacteria and viruses, and serves to clear them from the body. In DPB, bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause the proliferation of inflammatory cells into the bronchiolar tissues. However, when neither bacteria are present with DPB, the inflammation continues for an as yet unknown reason. In either circumstance, inflammation in DPB can be so severe that nodules containing inflammatory cells form in the walls of the bronchioles. The presence of inflammation and infection in the airways also results in the production of excess <b>mucus,</b> which must be coughed up as sputum. The combination of inflammation, nodule development, infection, <b>mucus,</b> and frequent cough contributes to the breathing difficulties in DPB.|$|E
5|$|MFGM {{phospholipid}} components such as phosphatidylcholine {{are a key}} constituent of {{the intestinal}} <b>mucus</b> barrier, and therefore may contribute to intestinal defense against invasive pathogens. Sphingolipids, including sphingomyelin, {{are present in the}} apical membrane of the gut epithelia, and are also important for maintaining membrane structure, modulating growth factor receptors, and serving competitive binding inhibitors for microorganisms, microbial toxins, and viruses. Gangliosides are also present in intestinal mucosa and may possibly contribute to improved gut microflora and antibacterial defense.|$|E
5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are opportunistic predators, catching prey which drifts {{within reach}} of their tentacles. The prey is secured {{with the help of}} sticky <b>mucus,</b> spirocysts (non-venomous harpoon cells) and nematocysts (venomous harpoon cells). The tentacles then bend to push larger prey into the mouth, while smaller, plankton-size prey, is moved by cilia to the tip of the tentacles which are then inserted into the mouth. The mouth can stretch to accommodate large items, and in some species, the lips may extend to help receive the prey. The pharynx then grasps the prey, which is mixed with <b>mucus</b> and slowly swallowed by peristalsis and ciliary action. When the food reaches the coelenteron, extracellular digestion is initiated by the discharge of the septa-based nematocysts and the release of enzymes. The partially digested food fragments are circulated in the coelenteron by cilia, and from here they are taken up by phagocytosis by the gastrodermal cells that line the cavity.|$|E
5|$|Most nemerteans are marine {{animals that}} burrow in sediments, lurk in crevices between shells, stones or the holdfasts of algae or sessile animals. Some live {{deep in the}} open oceans, and have {{gelatinous}} bodies. Others build semi-permanent burrows lined with <b>mucus</b> or produce cellophane-like tubes. Mainly in the tropics and subtropics, about 12 species appear in freshwater, and about a dozen species live on land in cool, damp places, for example under rotting logs.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{contraception}} involve the cervix. Cervical diaphragms are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted {{by a woman}} prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against {{the walls of the}} vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. Cervical caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. Diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with spermicides. In one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use. Most types of progestogen-only pills are effective as a contraceptive because they thicken cervical <b>mucus</b> making it difficult for sperm to pass along the cervical canal. In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation. In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the combined oral contraceptive pills, work mainly by preventing ovulation. They also thicken cervical <b>mucus</b> and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|The lungs possess several {{characteristics}} which {{protect against}} infection. The lung tract is lined by epithelia with hair-like projections called cilia that beat rhythmically and carry <b>mucus.</b> This mucociliary clearance {{is an important}} defence system against air-borne infection. The dust particles and bacteria in the inhaled air {{are caught in the}} mucosal surface of respiratory passages and are moved up towards the pharynx by the rhythmic upward beating action of the cilia. The lining of the lung also secretes immunoglobulin A which protects against respiratory infections; goblet cells secrete <b>mucus</b> which also contains several antimicrobial compounds such as defensins, antiproteases, and antioxidates. In addition, the lining of the lung also contains macrophages, immune cells which engulf and destroy debris and microbes that enter the lung in a process known as phagocytosis; and dendritic cells which present antigens to activate components of the adaptive immune system such as T-cells and B-cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{molluscan}} shell {{appears to}} have originated from a <b>mucus</b> coating, which eventually stiffened into a cuticle. This would have been impermeable and thus forced {{the development of more}} sophisticated respiratory apparatus in the form of gills. Eventually, the cuticle would have become mineralized, using the same genetic machinery (engrailed) as most other bilaterian skeletons. The first mollusc shell almost certainly was reinforced with the mineral aragonite.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer layer}} of the {{epidermis}} (outer skin) consists of: sensory cells; cells that secrete <b>mucus,</b> which protects the body; and interstitial cells, which can transform into other types of cell. In specialized {{parts of the body}} the outer layer also contains colloblasts, found along the surface of tentacles and used in capturing prey, or cells bearing multiple large cilia, for locomotion. The inner {{layer of the}} epidermis contains a nerve net, and myoepithelial cells that act as muscles.|$|E
5|$|The person’s throat {{is first}} swabbed {{to collect a}} sample of <b>mucus.</b> In most RSTs, this <b>mucus</b> sample is then exposed to a reagent {{containing}} antibodies that will bind specifically to a GAS antigen. A positive result is signified by a certain visible reaction. There are three major types of RST: First, a latex fixation test, which was developed in the 1980s and is largely obsolete. It employs latex beads covered with antigens that will visibly agglutinate around GAS antibodies if these are present. Second, a lateral flow test, which is currently the most widely used RST. The sample is applied to a strip of nitrocellulose film and, if GAS antigens are present, these will migrate along the film to form a visible line of antigen bound to labeled antibodies. Third, optical immunoassay is the newest and more expensive test. It involves mixing the sample with labeled antibodies and then with a special substrate on a film which changes colour to signal {{the presence or absence of}} GAS antigen.|$|E
5|$|The proliferative {{phase is}} {{the second phase of}} the uterine cycle when {{estrogen}} causes the lining of the uterus to grow, or proliferate, during this time. As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of estradiol, and estrogen. The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The estrogen also stimulates crypts in the cervix to produce fertile cervical <b>mucus,</b> which may be noticed by women practicing fertility awareness.|$|E
5|$|The sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus) is a predatory blenny, an {{aggressive}} mimic which accurately resembles the bluestreak cleaner wrasse, {{not only in}} colour and pattern, {{but also in the}} ritualised dance the cleaner wrasse makes when potential client fish swim nearby. However, instead of providing the cleaning service that it signals, it bites off pieces of healthy skin, scales and <b>mucus</b> from the host and then swims rapidly away to safety.|$|E
5|$|The slime glands {{along the}} body of the hagfish secrete {{enormous}} amounts of <b>mucus</b> when it is provoked or stressed. The gelatinous slime has dramatic effects on the flow and viscosity of water, rapidly clogging the gills of any fish that attempt to capture hagfish; predators typically release the hagfish within seconds (pictured above). Common predators of hagfish include seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans, but few fish, suggesting that predatory fish avoid hagfish as prey.|$|E
5|$|The stomach {{itself is}} {{protected}} from the strong acid by the secretion of a thick <b>mucus</b> layer, and by secretin induced buffering with sodium bicarbonate. Heartburn or peptic ulcers can develop when these mechanisms fail. Drugs of the antihistaminic and proton pump inhibitor classes can inhibit the production of acid in the stomach, and antacids are used to neutralize existing acid.|$|E
5|$|With {{erythromycin}} {{therapy in}} DPB, great reduction in bronchiolar inflammation and damage is achieved through suppression {{of not only}} neutrophil proliferation, but also lymphocyte activity and obstructive <b>mucus</b> and water secretions in airways. The antibiotic effects of macrolides {{are not involved in}} their beneficial effects toward reducing inflammation in DPB. This is evident because the treatment dosage is much too low to fight infection, and in DPB cases with the occurrence of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa, erythromycin therapy still reduces inflammation.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the lower}} {{respiratory}} tract including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. This is a ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce <b>mucus,</b> and club cells with actions similar to macrophages. Incomplete rings of cartilage in the trachea and smaller plates of cartilage in the bronchi, keep these airways open. Bronchioles are too narrow to support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium. The respiratory tract ends in lobules. Each lobule consists of a respiratory bronchiole, which branches into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, which in turn divide into alveoli.|$|E
5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of an {{apparently}} freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of <b>mucus.</b> As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates {{of the speed of}} rotation of the style in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the tree frog family, the green and golden bell frog spends much time basking in the sun on vegetation, rocks, and reeds, usually near water, or hopping around between such places. Unlike most frog species, it is often active during the day. When handled, this species secretes a slimy acrid <b>mucus,</b> which {{consists}} of 17 aurein peptides. Thirteen of these show broad-spectrum antibiotic and anticancer activity. The secretion makes the frog slippery and hard to grip, and is poisonous to some other species of frogs, so it is a useful defensive tool for green and golden bell frogs. Males often fight one another if they come within 1 m of each other, frequently leading to injuries.|$|E
5|$|Cells of {{the genus}} Azotobacter are {{relatively}} large for bacteria (1–2 μm in diameter). They are usually oval, but may take various forms from rods to spheres. In microscopic preparations, the cells can be dispersed or form irregular clusters or occasionally chains of varying lengths. In fresh cultures, cells are mobile due to the numerous flagella. Later, the cells lose their mobility, become almost spherical, and produce {{a thick layer of}} <b>mucus,</b> forming the cell capsule. The shape of the cell is affected by the amino acid glycine which is present in the nutrient medium peptone.|$|E
5|$|Fertility {{awareness}} {{methods that}} rely on cycle length records alone are called calendar-based methods. Methods that require observation {{of one or more}} of the three primary fertility signs (basal body temperature, cervical <b>mucus,</b> and cervical position) are known as symptoms-based methods. Urine test kits are available that detect the LH surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation; these are known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs). Computerized devices that interpret basal body temperatures, urinary test results, or changes in saliva are called fertility monitors.|$|E
5|$|Like other animals, fish {{suffer from}} {{diseases}} and parasites. To prevent disease {{they have a}} variety of defenses. Non-specific defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the <b>mucus</b> layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. If pathogens breach these defenses, fish can develop an inflammatory response that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an immune response. In recent years, vaccines have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example furunculosis vaccines in farmed salmon and koi herpes virus in koi.|$|E
5|$|Many {{amphibians}} {{catch their}} prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing {{it back into}} the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws. Some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey, repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia. Most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs. The short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and <b>mucus</b> produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage. The enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey.|$|E
