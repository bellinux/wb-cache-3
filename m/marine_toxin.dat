40|$|Most <b>marine</b> <b>toxins</b> are a {{structurally}} and toxicologically {{diverse group}} of secondary metabolites produced by dinoflagellates and diatoms or bacteria (tetrodotoxins). They are nonproteinacious and heat-stable compounds responsible {{for a series of}} human poisonings caused by contaminated seafood consumption or by seawater/aerosol exposure, but also for marine mammals and birth moribidity/mortality, and fish kills. As a consequence of ecological changes from anthropogenic activities, such as increased eutrophication, marine transport, and climate changes favouring the proliferation of toxic microalgae, the risks from <b>marine</b> <b>toxins</b> had increased in the last decades. This chapter summarizes the chemical, biological, toxicological and regulatory aspects of the most dangerous or common <b>marine</b> <b>toxins...</b>|$|R
40|$|Many {{instrumental}} {{techniques are}} currently employed to identify <b>marine</b> <b>toxins</b> and characterize their structures, with {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) being {{the most popular and}} powerful. Although NMR is the technique of choice to fully elucidate stereostructure of new molecules, its applicability depends on availability of g to mg amounts of pure compound. This is often difficult to achieve in the field of <b>marine</b> <b>toxins,</b> which are usually present at sub-mg levels in complex matrices {{in the form of a}} wide array of different congeners. So recently, several MS based approaches have been developed to disclose the presence of toxins and to elucidate their structures based on the interpretation of their fragmentation pattern.

40|$|Background: Bacterial toxins are toxic {{compounds}} {{which are}} produced {{in order to}} present microbial pathogenicity or to combat with the host immune system response. There is a cumulating evidence indicating bacterial origin for <b>marine</b> <b>toxins</b> such as tetrodotoxin, palytoxin, neosurugatoxin, etc. The most important <b>marine</b> <b>toxins</b> produced by different marine bacteria, their origin, structure and mechanisms of action were evaluated in a systematic review. Materials & Methods: Marine bacteria, <b>marine</b> bacterial <b>toxins,</b> and their mechanisms of action and structure were keywords for a comprehensive search in online databases including Pubmed, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Scirus. A total of 120 papers were evaluated, however, by omitting similar reports, 103 papers {{were included in the}} study. Results: The most of <b>marine</b> bacterial <b>toxins</b> are classified in one of the following groups: neurotoxins, hepatotoxins and cytotoxins. These toxins have distinct mechanisms of action including blocking of sodium channels in nerve cells, functioning as agonists of acetylcholine receptors, inhibiting of membrane pumps, the inhibition of protein phosphatases 1 and 2 A types' enzyme activities and inhibiting of protein synthesis. Conclusion: The clarification of the <b>marine</b> bacterial <b>toxins</b> structures and their mechanisms of action may be helpful for novel drug design, therapeutic measures and to overcome against bacterial pathogenicity...|$|R
5000|$|Brevisamide is a {{proposed}} biosynthetic precursor for the polyether <b>marine</b> <b>toxin</b> Brevenal, which {{is among the}} family of Brevetoxins that are known to cause Red Tide. [...] Ghosh and Li reported the enantioselective synthesis of Brevisamide through the convergent assembly of the tetrahydropyran core via an enantioselective hetero-Diels-Alder reaction of a triethylsilyl diene and aldehyde A followed by a Rubottom oxidation of the resulting cyclic silyl enol ether under buffered conditions. Chiral chromium catalyst B was developed the Jacobsen group and confers high levels of enantio- and diastereoselectivity. The stereocenters conveniently set in the Diels-Alder reaction direct the oxidation to the less hindered face, giving a single diastereomer, which could then be carried on in 14 more steps to Brevisamide.|$|E

40|$|Marine {{microorganisms}} harbor {{a multitude}} of secondary metabolites. Among these are toxins of different chemical classes {{as well as the}} UV-protective mycosporinelike amino acids (MAAs). The latter form a group of water-soluble, low molecular-weight (generally < 400) compounds composed of either an aminocyclohexenone or an aminocyclohexenimine ring, carrying amino acid or amino alcohol substituents. So far there has been no report of toxicity in MAAs but nevertheless there are some features they have in common with <b>marine</b> <b>toxins.</b> Among the organisms producing MAAs are cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates and diatoms that also synthesize toxins. As in cyclic peptide toxins found in cyanobacteria, amino acids are the main building blocks of MAAs. Both, MAAs and some <b>marine</b> <b>toxins</b> are transferred to other organisms e. g. via the food chains, and chemical modifications can take place in secondary consumers. In contrast to algal toxins, the physiological role of MAAs is clearly the protection from harmful UV radiation by physical screening. However, other roles, e. g. as osmolytes and antioxidants, are also considered. In this paper the common characteristics of MAAs and <b>marine</b> <b>toxins</b> are discussed as well as the differences...|$|R

40|$|Lipophilic <b>marine</b> <b>toxins</b> are {{produced}} by certain algae species and can accumulate in filter feeding shellfish such as mussels, scallops and oysters. Consumption of contaminated shellfish can lead to severe intoxications such as diarrhea, abdominal cramps and vomiting. Methods described in European Union (EU) legislation to test {{for the presence of}} these toxins are based on a mouse or rat bioassay. These assays are unethical and have a poor sensitivity and selectivity. The aim of this thesis is to develop an alternative method based on liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the quantitative analysis of lipophilic <b>marine</b> <b>toxins.</b> LC-MS/MS methods described in literature for the determination of lipophilic <b>marine</b> <b>toxins</b> used an acidic chromatographic system. Under acidic conditions peak shape and separation of a number of toxins preferably analyzed in electrospray ionization negative (ESI–) and positive (ESI+) were poor. A LC-MS/MS method with alkaline chromatographic conditions in which we were able to analyze 28 different toxins in a single analysis in separated retention time windows operating in either ESI– or ESI+ was developed. Furthermore, a clean up procedure based on solid phase extraction (SPE) was developed {{to reduce the amount of}} matrix effects (ion suppression and enhancement). A combination of SPE clean up and alkaline chromatographic conditions resulted in reduced matrix effects for all matrices tested (mussel, scallop and oyster). The developed SPE & LC-MS/MS method was in-house validated at regulatory limits based on EU Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC. With respect to accuracy, repeatability, reproducibility, decision limit, specificity and ruggedness the method performed well. The method also performed excellently in view of possible new limits that are four- to five-fold lower than current limits for some toxins. Finally a screening method based on LC orbitrap MS was developed for 85 <b>marine</b> <b>toxins</b> of which most are not stated in EU legislation. The screening used in-house developed software which made it possible to reduce the complex data files and screen for a large number of toxins within seconds.

40|$|Various {{species of}} algae can produce <b>marine</b> <b>toxins</b> under certain circumstances. These toxins can then {{accumulate}} in shellfish such as mussels, oysters and scallops. When these contaminated shellfish species are consumed severe intoxication can occur. The {{different types of}} syndromes that can occur after consumption of contaminated shellfish, the corresponding toxins and relevant legislation are discussed in this review. Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP), Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP), Diarrheic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) and Azaspiracid Shellfish Poisoning (AZP) occur worldwide, Neurologic Shellfish Poisoning (NSP) is mainly limited to the USA and New Zealand while the toxins causing DSP and AZP occur most frequently in Europe. The latter two toxin groups are fatsoluble and can therefore also be classified as lipophilic <b>marine</b> <b>toxins.</b> A detailed overview of the official analytical methods used in the EU (mouse or rat bioassay) and the recently developed alternative methods for the lipophilic <b>marine</b> <b>toxins</b> is given. These alternative methods are based on functional assays, biochemical assays and chemical methods. From the literature {{it is clear that}} chemical methods offer the best potential to replace the animal tests that are still legislated worldwide. Finally, an overview is given of the situation of <b>marine</b> <b>toxins</b> in The Netherlands. The rat bioassay has been used for monitoring DSP and AZP toxins in The Netherlands since the 1970 s. Nowadays, a combination of a chemical method and the rat bioassay is often used. In The Netherlands toxic events are mainly caused by DSP toxins, which have been found in Dutch shellfish {{for the first time in}} 1961, and have reoccurred at irregular intervals and in varying concentrations. From this review it is clear that considerable effort is being undertaken by various research groups to phase out the animal tests that are still used for the official routine monitoring programs. © 2010 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland...|$|R

To fill this gap, a screening method using LC coupled to high resolution (HR) orbitrap MS (resolution 100 000) for <b>marine</b> lipophilic <b>toxins</b> has been developed. The method can detect a wide variety of okadaic acid (OA), yessotoxin (YTX), azaspiracid (AZA) and pectenotoxin (PTX) group toxins. To build a library of toxins, shellfish and algae samples with various toxin profiles were obtained from Norway, Ireland, United Kingdom, Portugal and Italy.

Based on their mass and specific fragmentation pattern, 85 different toxins were identified comprising 33 OA, 26 YTX, 18 AZA and 8 PTX group toxins. A major complication of full scan HRMS is the huge amount of data generated (file size), which restricts the possibility of a fast search. A software program called metAlign was used to reduce the orbitrap MS data files. The 200 -fold reduced data files were screened using an additional software tool for metAlign: ‘Search_LCMS’.
