40|$|Morphology {{became the}} {{important}} study in Linguistics {{in case of}} word formation. Derivation and inflection affixes as field of Morphology {{became one of the}} vital ways in forming word. Recently, many previous researchers focused on derivation affixes, while the inflection affixes do not get much attention. Therefore, the researcher combined those two points in this present study. Yule (2006) ’s theory of derivation and inflection affixes are applied in this research. This theory is used to analyze the process and the function of derivation and inflection affixes in Snow novel. Qualitative content analysis is used in this study to investigate derivation and inflection affixes. The research instrument is only the researcher himself. The researcher reads and selects the word which contain derivation and inflection affixes in Snow novel. Then, the researcher analyzes the data by classifying and explaining derivation and inflection data. Derivation affixes consist of 1 adverb maker (ly), 14 noun makers (ion, ment, ness, ity, ty, cy, ure, ce, ance, ence, er, or, ist, ant), 11 adjective makers (less, ous, al, ical, ive, ible, able, ish, y, ry), 5 verb makers (prefix-en, suffixes- en, fy, ize, ate). Meanwhile, there are only eight inflection affixes which are found in Snow novel. They consist of 1 past tense maker (ed), 1 past participle maker (en), 1 present participle maker (ing), 1 third person singular <b>maker</b> (<b>S),</b> 1 possessive <b>maker</b> (<b>S),</b> 1 plural <b>maker</b> (<b>S),</b> 1 comparative <b>maker</b> (er) and 1 superlative maker (est). Derivational suffix ly to form adverb is the most frequently present in Snow novel, it is 33, 90 %. It is equal with 121 words which contain affix adverb. Meanwhile, inflectional suffix ed as past tense maker became the biggest amount in Snow novel, it is 33, 58 %. It is equal with 134 words which contain suffix to form past tense...|$|R

40|$|Results are {{presented}} for unidirectional (0, 10) (sub s) and (90, 10) (sub <b>s)</b> <b>plates,</b> ((0 / 90) (sub 5) (sub <b>s))</b> <b>plates,</b> and for aluminum plates. Results are also presented for ((+/- theta) (sub 6) (sub <b>s))</b> angle-ply <b>plates</b> for values of theta = 30, 45, and 60 degrees. The {{results indicate that}} the change in axial stiffness of a plate at buckling is strongly dependent upon cutout size and plate orthotropy. The presence of a cutout gives rise to an internal load distribution that changes, sometimes dramatically, as a function of cutout size coupled with the plate orthotropy. In the buckled state, the role of orthotropy becomes more significant since bending in addition to membrane orthotropy is present. Most of the plates with cutouts exhibited less postbuckling stiffness than the corresponding plate without a cutout, and the postbuckling stiffness decreased with increasing cutout size. However, some of the highly orthotropic plates with cutouts exhibited more postbuckling stiffness than the corresponding plate without a cutout. These results suggest the possibility of tailoring the cutout size and the stacking sequence of a composite plate to optimize postbuckling stiffness. It was found that plates with large radius cutouts do exhibit some postbuckling strength. The results also indicate that a cutout can influence modal interaction in a plate. Specifically, results {{are presented}} that show a plate with a relatively small cutout buckling at a higher load than the corresponding plate without a cutout, due to modal interaction. Other results are presented that indicate the presence of nonlinear prebuckling deformations, due to material nonlinearity, in the angle-ply plates with theta = 45 and 60 degrees. The nonlinear prebuckling deformations are more pronounced in the plates with theta = 45 degrees and become even more pronounced as the cutout size increases. Results are also presented that show how load-path eccentricity due to improper machining of the test specimens affects the buckling behavior. Some of the plates with cutouts and eccentricity exhibited a snap-through type of buckling behavior...|$|R

He took an instrument from his school orchestra to the instrument <b>maker</b> <b>S.</b> Snehiriov for repairs, and he saw there an unknown instrument. Snehiriov explained that the instrument was a Ukrainian folk instrument known as a bandura, and that he was making the instrument for the bandurist-artist of the Kharkiv drama theatre - I. Bondarenko. The bandura interested the young Haydamaka greatly, and Haydamaka ordered an instrument for himself. When the bandura was ready, the question arose - where to learn to play the instrument? Haydamaka chased down Bondarenko and asked him to tune up the instrument and show him some initial exercises. He later devised exercises and pieces for the instrument by himself and began to arrange pieces for the instrument himself.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{extensive}} literature on prediction of banking crises by Early Warning Systems (EWS), their practical use by policy makers is limited, {{even in the}} international financial institutions. This is a paradox since {{the changing nature of}} banking risks as more economies liberalise and develop their financial systems, as well as ongoing innovation, makes the use of EWS for crisis prevention more necessary than ever. In this context, we assess the logit and signal extraction EWS for banking crises on a comprehensive common dataset. We suggest that logit is the most appropriate approach for global EWS and signal extraction for country specific EWS. Furthermore {{it is important to consider}} the policy <b>maker</b> <b>s</b> objectives when designing predictive models and setting related thresholds since there is a sharp trade-off between correctly calling crises and false alarms...|$|R

40|$|In Misch Class IV dental {{implants}} are {{not normally}} {{placed at the}} same time as the sinus lift procedure. For this type of situation the use of several devices to immediately stabilise implants lacking in primary stability is proposed. Among these, the titanium <b>S.</b> I. <b>S.</b> <b>plate</b> results as being the most straightforward. This study proposes the evaluation of the effectiveness and stability of the results of this method in the short term on a greater number of patients, monitoring bones levels and implant stability. 14 patients were selected, 9 males and 5 females, aged between 43 and 75 years of age. Overall, 42 implants were placed in the upper posterior edentulous zones with Misch Class IV atrophy including first and second premolars and first molars, opposite fixed teeth, and were stabilised using the <b>S.</b> I. <b>S.</b> <b>plate.</b> Radiographic controls and ISQ measurements with AFR at 1, 6 and 12 months after loading testify to the stability of the bone levels which concur with success criteria found in literature. The technique described seems to be able to ensure success in cases of Misch Class IV with contemporaneous placement of the osseo-integrated implants. This clinical study, even if carried out on a small number of patients (14) and implants (42) represents the largest case history published. The technique described seems to ensure the success of cases of Misch Class IV with contemporaneous placement of osseo-integrated implants. The technique is straightforward and reproducible and does not cause further trauma. The S. I. S. allows for the stabilisation of the dental implants and the residual crest when there is a lack of primary stability. In Misch Class IV this means a considerable reduction in treatment times...|$|R

To determine the intracellular signals {{involved in these}} changes, concentrations of the second messenger inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate [Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3] were monitored during adherence of J 774. 1 cells, a macrophage-like cell line. When cells grown in suspension were allowed to adhere to a glass surface, there was a transient increase in InsP 3 that reached a peak between 100 and 120 <b>s</b> after <b>plating.</b> Inositol mono- and bis-phosphate concentrations were also elevated 100 and 120 <b>s</b> after <b>plating.</b> Analysis of isomer distribution showed significant 3 -fold increases in Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 and inositol 1, 3, 4, 5 -tetrakisphosphate [Ins(1, 3, 4, 5) P 4] at 100 <b>s</b> after <b>plating.</b> These values were maintained at 120 s, with the additional appearance of a 4 -fold increase in inositol 1, 3, 4 -trisphosphate.
