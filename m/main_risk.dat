5|$|The {{withdrawal}} method (also {{known as}} coitus interruptus) is {{the practice of}} ending intercourse ("pulling out") before ejaculation. The <b>main</b> <b>risk</b> of the withdrawal method is that the man may not perform the maneuver correctly or in a timely manner. First-year failure rates vary from 4% with perfect usage to 22% with typical usage. It is not considered birth control by some medical professionals.|$|E
5|$|Depleted uranium is {{also used}} as a {{shielding}} material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast {{as well as its}} relatively low cost. The <b>main</b> <b>risk</b> of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).|$|E
5|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to high inspired fractions of oxygen causes {{damage to the}} retina. Damage to the developing eye of infants exposed to high oxygen fraction at normal pressure has a different mechanism and effect from the eye damage experienced by adult divers under hyperbaric conditions. Hyperoxia may be a contributing factor for the disorder called retrolental fibroplasia or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants. In preterm infants, the retina is often not fully vascularised. Retinopathy of prematurity occurs {{when the development of}} the retinal vasculature is arrested and then proceeds abnormally. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a risk factor, is not the <b>main</b> <b>risk</b> factor for development of this disease. Restricting supplemental oxygen use does not necessarily reduce the rate of retinopathy of prematurity, and may raise the risk of hypoxia-related systemic complications.|$|E

25|$|Dry suit squeeze. The <b>main</b> <b>risk</b> is skin getting pinched {{and bruised}} by {{folds of the}} dry suit when {{squeezed}} on descent.

25|$|Diving {{mask squeeze}} {{enclosing}} {{the eyes and}} nose: The <b>main</b> <b>risk</b> is rupture of the capillaries of the eyes and facial skin because of the negative pressure difference between the gas space and blood pressure, or orbital emphysema from higher pressures.

25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>risk</b> of {{cardioversion}} is systemic embolization of a thrombus (blood clot) {{from the}} previously fibrillating left atrium.

Anticoagulation is adequate if warfarin is given with target INR between 2 and 3 {{for three to four}} weeks prior to cardioversion, and continued for at least four weeks after cardioversion. Cardioversion may be performed in instances of AF lasting more than 48hours if a transesophogeal echocardiogram (TEE) demonstrates no evidence of clot within the heart.|$|E

25|$|A {{moderate}} risk {{of severe}} weather was {{issued by the}} Storm Prediction Center (SPC) for April 2, with the <b>main</b> <b>risk</b> being tornadoes and large hail. The primary risk area was the central Mississippi Valley and lower Ohio Valley up to central Illinois, which is {{where most of the}} tornadoes touched down. Many tornado watches– although no PDS watches– would be issued across the region. While a significant severe weather event was expected, the extreme nature caught many forecasters by surprise, based on the risk levels and probabilities estimated by the SPC in the main area affected.|$|E
25|$|On May 29, the Storm Prediction Center {{issued a}} {{moderate}} risk for parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The outlook included a 10% hatched risk for tornadoes. A separate slight risk was issued for parts of New England. In the <b>main</b> <b>risk</b> area, only scattered weak tornadoes touched down, though a mile-wide EF2 wedge tornado touched down in upstate New York near Schenectady. On May 30, {{for the second}} day in a row, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk with a 10% hatched risk of tornadoes, this time for eastern Oklahoma and {{a small part of}} Kansas. Numerous tornadoes touched down in Oklahoma and Arkansas, including a few that were strong. An EF2 ripped through the Tulsa suburb of Broken Arrow, resulting in severe damage to homes and businesses. A brief EF1 near Tull, Arkansas unfortunately caused a fatality due to a falling tree.|$|E
25|$|Enteroliths in {{horses are}} round 'stones' of mineral deposits, usually of {{ammonium}} magnesium phosphate (struvite) but sometimes of magnesium vivainite and some amounts of sodium, potassium, sulfur and calcium, which develop within the horse's gastrointestinal tract. They can form around {{a piece of}} ingested foreign material, such as a small nidus of wire or sand (similar to how an oyster forms a pearl). When they move from their original site they can obstruct the intestine, usually in the right dorsal and transverse colon, but rarely in the small colon. They may also cause mucosal irritation or pain when they move within the gastrointestinal tract. Enteroliths are not a common cause of colic, but {{are known to have}} a higher prevalence in states with a sandy soil or an abundance of alfalfa hay is fed, such as California, a state where 28% of surgical colics are due to enteroliths. Alfalfa hay is thought to increase the risk due the high protein content in the hay, which would likely elevate ammonia nitrogen levels within the intestine. They may be more common in horses with diets high in magnesium, and are also seen more often in Arabians, Morgans, American Saddlebreds, Miniature horses, and donkeys, and usually occur in horses older than four years of age. Horses with enteroliths typically have chronic, low-grade, recurring colic signs, which may lead to acute colic and distention of the large colon after occlusion of the lumen occurs. These horse may also have had a history of passing enteroliths in their manure. Level of pain is related to the degree of luminal occlusion. Abdominal radiographs can confirm the diagnosis, but smaller enteroliths may not be visible. In rare instances, enteroliths may be palpated on rectal examination, usually if they are present in the small colon. Once a horse is diagnosed with colic due to an enterolith, surgery is necessary to remove it, usually by pelvic flexure enterotomy and sometimes an additional right dorsal colon enterotomy, and fully resolve the signs of colic. Horses will usually present a round enterolith if it is the only one present, while multiple entheroliths will usually have flat sides, a clue to the surgeon to look for more stones. The <b>main</b> <b>risk</b> of surgery is rupture of the colon (15% of cases), and 92% of horses that are recovered survive to at least 1 year from their surgery date.|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work was the {{identification}} and quantification of the specific risks affecting the collections in the storage building of Palma de Baixo. These collections belong to the Museu de Lisboa {{and they are very}} diversified: ceramics, paintings, furniture, graphic documents and textiles. The methodology used to identify the risk and calculate its magnitude was based on the risk analysis model proposed by Waller, entitled "Cultural Property Risk Analysis Model". The results showed that the <b>main</b> <b>risks</b> for these collections are the high variations in relative humidity, water-based floor cleaning, poor organization of spaces leading to overcrowding and finally, inappropriate labeling of objects. The furniture and painting collections are the ones at greater risk. Mitigation proposals were also made for the <b>main</b> <b>risks</b> encountered...|$|R

2500|$|The <b>main</b> <b>risk</b> {{factor for}} stroke is high blood pressure.

An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, {{though there are}} also less common causes. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either [...] bleeding directly into the brain or into {{the space between the}} brain's membranes. Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. Diagnosis is typically with medical imaging such as a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan along with a physical exam. Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes. Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms.|$|E
