40|$|AbstractMachining {{processes}} of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) are commonly required {{in order to}} achieve final assembly specifications. Despite the good mechanical properties of this kind of materials, they are hard to be machined due to the presence of hard particles; delamination, fiber pull-out and matrix thermal degradation are usually observed during its <b>machining.</b> <b>Drilling</b> operations are required before mechanical joining of the CFRP components. The actual interest in reducing delamination rests in {{the fact that it is}} the most serious damage found during drilling. In this work, a comparative study of three special geometries under different cutting conditions is presented.

The use of composites in the manufacturing sector plays a very important role in the industry in general. Moreover these materials have unique characteristics when analyzed separately from constituents which are a part of them.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation on {{the influence of}} fiber volume reinforcement on various aspects of <b>machining.</b> <b>Drilling</b> experiments were conducted to study the tool wear, surface finish, delamination factor and hole quality on GFRP composites. The work reports the variation of tool wear, surface roughness, hole quality, chip characteristics, delamination factor with the variation of fibre volume reinforcement. Results revealed that the increase in fiber percentage increased the tool wear, delamination factor, surface roughness value and decreased hole quality. Minimum surface roughness, tool wear and better hole quality was obtained for 30 % fibre content composites. 70 % Fibre content composites produced hazardous surface roughness. Pull out of fibres and fibril formation are significant in decreasing the hole quality and increased surface roughness. Increased tool – fibre interaction and thermal softening of the tool causes increased tool wear. In higher fibre content composites, extensive plasticity was absent consequently brittle ceramic fibres were fractured easily. Hence small segment type chips were obtained. The fibre pull out and fibrils present near the hole exit forms the remainder of the laminate causes increased damage zone near the hole exit. Hence high delamination factor was obtained...|$|E

30|$|There is, thus, a {{mass loss}} which {{indicates}} {{a phenomenon of}} erosion. Our objective is to measure {{the rate of the}} mass loss and also to identify the nature of the phenomenon, whether it is a pure mechanical effect or combined with a chemical effect (solvent). In literature, Momber (1998), worked on the mechanical effects of water jet on several types of materials for industrial applications such as <b>machining,</b> <b>drilling,</b> cutting and hydro demolition. For this author, cement composites are quasi brittle materials. In Momber et al. (1995) and Momber (2001) he analyzed the erosion mechanism by the parameters of fracture mechanics in the sense of pre-existing cracks propagated under the effect of the water jet. In this case the compression strength is not sufficient to describe erosion but the fracture depends greatly {{on the size of the}} aggregates used. At high pressure water jet exceeding 30 times the tensile strength of the material, Momber et al. (1995) deduced that the interface paste aggregates has a significant impact on erosion, it is the origin of the micro-cracks, leading to erosion. Other researchers like (Liu et al. 2006) and (Liu et al. 2012) had studied the effect of the flow of river water on concrete surfaces, in Liu et al. (2006) erosion of concrete is presented as an abrasion phenomenon that can be corrected by the addition of silica fume and fibers. The same author in (2012) has simulated the flow of river water by a jet of water containing sand combining the water-jet impact load and sand particle shear/friction. He found that the rate of erosion is related to the amount of grain moved by the flow of water and to the angle of the water jet to the impact surface. The authors agree that the interface between hardened cement paste and aggregate play the main role in the fracture process by erosion. Aala Rashad et al. (2014) have studied the abrasion of industrial floors and have found a direct relation between the abrasion resistance and the compression strength; they have concluded that the silicate fume improves such abrasion resistance.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 As every {{manufacturer}} of carbon-fiber composite structures knows, {{one of the}} most nettlesome aspects of the production process is that <b>machining,</b> <b>drilling</b> and sanding of carbon fiber composites produces fine dust. These composite materials typically consist of epoxy matrix material reinforced with carbon, graphite, glass, and/or para-aramid fibers. Matrix materials are usually epoxy, polyester, phenolic, fluorocarbon, polyether-sulfone, and silicon. The most commonly used are epoxies and polyesters, which are less expensive than epoxies. It can build up on and short out computers, control panels and servomotors. In the air, it can be inhaled and threaten human health. Further, the accumulation of any dust in a manufacturing facility can be problematic from the regulatory perspective. In fact, dust has been blamed for several explosions in manufacturing facilities, leading the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Admin. (OSHA) and many local governments to more closely monitor and regulate dust accumulation in all manufacturing environments. An increase in human exposure to potentially toxic airborne fibers has accompanied the increased use of composite materials. The dust emitted during the machining of composite materials is potentially damaging to the human lung. Several studies have attempted to characterize the damage to the lung caused by airborne particles from composites, while other studies have characterized the size and concentration of the dust emitted. Some {{studies have shown that the}} chip formation process affects the size distribution of the particles emitted during the machining of composites. Health hazard evaluation of composite matrix material is usually conducted by examining the individual materials that are in the resin system and using sound scientific judgment. The main objective of this research is to quantify the amount of dust generated during machining (predominantly milling) of composites and to calculate what percentage of this dust is harmful to the workers in such composite dust laden environments. This criteria is based on PM (Particulate matter) aerosol standards defined by OSHA in regard to safety and well-being. In addition this research will also highlight the effect of stacking sequence of laminates on the concentration of dust generated and the characterization of these particle sizes. This research also further aims to develop optimized cutting conditions that will help in reducing the amount of dust that would be generated by using an experimental study. During this study different tests were carried out to characterize the different effects that are observed during the machining of Uni-Directional and random fiber composites. The machining dust results showed a very good correlation between the different real time measuring instruments and validated the design of the iso-kinetic sampling tower. Mean aerodynamic diameters of particles found during the machining of Uni-Directional composites was 0. 19 um and that of random fiber composites was found to be 0. 28 um. Tests to find out the optimal cutting conditions for the lowest amount of dust generated was found to be that of using a low cutting speed, high feed and lower depth of cuts. These conditions however might not aid the best surface finish. Hence a compromise or a trade-off is required...|$|E
