40|$|<b>Man-made</b> <b>object</b> {{detection}} is {{of great}} significance in both military and civil areas, such as search-and-rescue missions at sea, traffic signs recognition during visual navigation, and targets location in a military strike. Contours of <b>man-made</b> <b>objects</b> usually consist of straight lines, corner points, and simple curves. Motivated by this observation, a <b>man-made</b> <b>object</b> detection method is proposed based on complexity evaluation of object contours. After salient contours which keep the crucial information of objects are accurately extracted using an improved mean-shift clustering algorithm, a novel approach is presented to evaluate the complexity of contours. By comparing the entropy values of contours before/after sampling and linear interpolation, {{it is easy to}} distinguish between <b>man-made</b> <b>objects</b> and natural ones according to the complexity of their contours. Experimental results show that the presented method can effectively detect <b>man-made</b> <b>objects</b> when compared to the existing ones.

40|$|Object {{concepts}} mediate {{objects in}} real world and their categorical information in human memory. They are context-sensitive constructions in working memory when activated. We hypothesized that <b>man-made</b> <b>object</b> concepts are more context-dependent than living things because <b>man-made</b> <b>object</b> concepts are constructed from the interaction among the object form, designer's intention, {{and the way in}} which the object was used. Results of a scenario-based categorization task support this hypothesis. This hypothesis also predicts that <b>man-made</b> <b>objects</b> will have higher individual difference and more different attributes than living things in the attribute-listing task. A mathematical description of attribute-listing data showed positive evidence. IUPsy...|$|R

40|$|This {{letter is}} {{dedicated}} to an automated approach for the detection and classification of <b>man-made</b> <b>objects</b> in urban corridors from point clouds acquired by vehicle–borne Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS). The approach is designed based on a-priori knowledge in urban areas: (i) <b>man-made</b> <b>objects</b> feature geometric regularity like vertical planar structures (e. g. building facades), while vegetation reveals a huge diversity in shape and point distribution; (ii) different types of urban <b>man-made</b> <b>objects</b> can be characterized by the point extension and height above the ground. Therefore, MLS-based point clouds are first divided into three layers {{with respect to the}} vertical height dimension. In each layer, seed points of <b>man-made</b> <b>objects</b> are indicated by a line-filter in the footprints of off-ground objects which is generated by binarizing the spatial accumulation map of point clouds. These seed points are further classified by examining in which layers the seed points of objects are found. Finally, points belonging to respective objects can be retrieved based on classified seed points. The experiments show that various <b>man-made</b> <b>objects</b> on both street sides can be well detected with a detection rate of up to 83 %. For the classification of detected urban objects, an overall accuracy of 92. 37 % can be achieved...|$|R
