For example, the most urgent need <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> public health specialists or airfield construction crews, which operate on a level far beyond the medical or engineering specialists of a US Special Forces unit. Public health or construction organizations, however, have limited or no self-defense capability and will need protection in insecure areas.|$|E

From 1915 to 1918, the high court martial of Württemberg handed down 655 sentences. Prison terms <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> one year for aggravated insubordination or one to three years for bodily harm to a superior. Harsher penalties could reach up to 15 years; for instance, this was the term given to two French prisoners who murdered a guard in 1916.|$|E

500|$|Following McCarthy {{dropping}} out of the race on October 8, the caucus vote was indefinitely postponed. Massie and Peter T. King referred to the House as a [...] "banana republic." [...] Massie also criticized Boehner for postponing the election, saying they [...] "called off the election because they didn’t like the result," [...] which was echoed by Tom Rice, Louie Gohmert, and Justin Amash. McMorris Rodgers and Conference Vice Chairwoman Lynn Jenkins defended Boehner, saying the matter was handled properly, as conference rules give him sole discretion. Rich Lowry of National Review asked McCarthy in a phone interview if the House was governable, to which McCarthy replied [...] "I don’t know. Sometimes you have to hit rock bottom."

500|$|Almost {{from the}} first, Yiddish theater drew {{a level of}} theater {{criticism}} comparable to any other European theater of its time. For example, Bercovici cites a [...] "brochure" [...] by one G. Abramski, published in 1877, that described and gave critiques of all of Goldfaden's plays of that year. Abramski speculated that the present day <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> Yiddish theater a moment comparable to the Elizabethan era for English theater. He discussed what a Yiddish theater ought to be, noted its many sources (ranging from Purim plays to circus pantomime), and praised its incorporation of strong female roles. He also criticized where he saw weaknesses, noting how unconvincingly a male actor played the mother in Shmendrik, or remarking of the play Di shtume kale (The Mute Bride) — a work that Goldfaden apparently wrote to accommodate a pretty, young actress who in the performance was too nervous to deliver her lines — that the only evidence of Goldfaden's authorship was his name.|$|E
500|$|Galois theory {{concerns}} {{transformations of}} number fields that permute {{the roots of}} an equation. Consider a polynomial equation of a variable x of degree n, in which the coefficients are drawn from some ground field, which <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> <b>for</b> example, the field of real numbers, rational numbers, or the integers modulo7. There {{may or may not}} be choices of x, which make this polynomial evaluate to zero. Such choices, if they exist, are called roots. If the polynomial is x2+1 and the field is the real numbers, then the polynomial has no roots, because any choice of x makes the polynomial greater than or equal to one. If the field is extended, however, then the polynomial may gain roots, and if it is extended enough, then it always has a number of roots equal to its degree. Continuing the previous example, if the field is enlarged to the complex numbers, then the polynomial gains two roots, i and −i, where i is the imaginary unit, that is, [...] More generally, the extension field in which a polynomial can be factored into its roots is known as the splitting field of the polynomial.|$|E

In his speech prior to the 1860 convention, he predicted the territory would {{become part of the}} U.S., and when he learned in 1864 that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> sale, he pressed the Russians (then a U.S. ally) for negotiations. The Russian minister, Baron Eduard de Stoeckl, returned home on leave in 1866. [...] Fearing that the territory might be overrun by American settlers and lost, he urged his government to sell it. [...] He was given the authority to make the sale and when he returned in March 1867, negotiated with the Secretary of State. Seward initially offered $5 million; the two men settled on $7 million and on March 15, Seward presented a draft treaty to the Cabinet. Stoeckl's superiors raised several concerns; to induce him to waive them, the final purchase price was increased to $7.2 million. The treaty was signed in the early morning of March 30, 1867, and ratified by the Senate on April 10. [...] Stevens sent the secretary a note of congratulations, predicting that the Alaska purchase would be seen as one of Seward's greatest accomplishments.|$|E
