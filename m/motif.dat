5|$|All LDL {{receptor}} family proteins {{contain a}} cytoplasmic tail {{with at least}} one NPXY <b>motif.</b> This <b>motif</b> is important for binding intracellular adapter proteins and endocytosis. ApoER2 is distinct from most other members of the LDL family of receptors due to a unique insert on its cytoplasmic tail. In ApoER2, there is a proline-rich 59 amino acid insert encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 19. This insert allows for protein interactions that are unable to occur with other LDL receptors. It binds the PSD-95 adapter protein, cross-linking ApoER2 and the NMDA receptors during the process of long-term potentiation, and is also bound specifically by JIP-2, an important interaction in the JNK signalling pathway. It is also speculated that this insert may diminish the function of ApoER2 in lipoprotein endocytosis by somehow disrupting the NPXY <b>motif.</b>|$|E
5|$|Among {{the various}} {{patterns}} and motifs found in Delian mosaics is the triple-colored lozenge {{that creates a}} three-dimensional illusion of cubes in perspective for the viewer.

The single wave pattern, a common <b>motif</b> in Hellenistic art, is the most predominant type of border design for mosaics at Delos and appear in mosaics of Arsameia (albeit arranged in the opposite direction). The rosette <b>motif,</b> which is found in the mosaics of various Hellenistic sites across the Mediterranean, is often coupled with single-wave borders in Delian mosaics. The typical Hellenistic palmette <b>motif</b> is used in a mosaic of Delos to fill the four corners around a central rosette <b>motif.</b> The illusion of three-dimensional relief in the figured scenes of Delian mosaics was usually achieved by the use of polychrome, with white, black, yellow, red, blue and green hues.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{problems}} of finding maximal and minimal equivalent representations for gapped and non-gapped <b>motifs</b> {{as well as}} finding <b>motifs</b> that characterize a fixed set of occurrence locations for a given string are studied. We apply two equivalence relations on representations. The first one is the well-known occurrence-equivalence of <b>motifs.</b> The second equivalence is introduced for patterns of occurrence locations, to characterize such patterns by <b>motifs.</b> For both equivalences, quadratic-time algorithms are given for finding a maximal representative of an equivalence class. Finding a minimal representative is shown to be NP-complete in both cases. For non-gapped <b>motifs</b> suffix-tree-based linear-time algorithms are given for finding maximal and minimal representatives. Maximal (minimal) gapped <b>motifs</b> are composed of blocks that are maximal (minimal) non-gapped <b>motifs,</b> maximal and minimal non-gapped <b>motifs</b> thus making up a small basis for all <b>motifs.</b> The implied bound {{on the number of}} gapped <b>motifs</b> that have a fixed number of non-gapped blocks is also given...|$|R

5|$|When {{bound to}} a protein, NAD and NADH are usually held within a {{structural}} <b>motif</b> {{known as the}} Rossmann fold. The <b>motif</b> is named after Michael Rossmann {{who was the first}} scientist to notice how common this structure is within nucleotide-binding proteins. This fold contains three or more parallel beta strands linked by two alpha helices in the order beta-alpha-beta-alpha-beta. This forms a beta sheet flanked by a layer of alpha helices on each side. Because each Rossmann fold binds one nucleotide, binding domains for NAD consist of two paired Rossmann folds, with each fold binding one of the two nucleotides of the cofactor. However, this fold is not universal among NAD-dependent enzymes, since a class of bacterial enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism have recently been discovered that bind the coenzyme, but lack this <b>motif.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Regulation of gene {{expression}} in Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) remains poorly understood. While {{over half the}} genes {{are estimated to be}} regulated at the transcriptional level, few regulatory <b>motifs</b> and transcription regulators have been found. Results The study seeks to identify putative regulatory <b>motifs</b> in the upstream regions of 13 functional groups of genes expressed in the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle of Pf. Three motif-discovery programs were used for the purpose, and <b>motifs</b> were searched for only on the gene coding strand. Four <b>motifs</b> – the 'G-rich', the 'C-rich', the 'TGTG' and the 'CACA' <b>motifs</b> – were identified, and zero to all four of these occur in the 13 sets of upstream regions. The 'CACA motif' was absent in functional groups expressed during the ring to early trophozoite transition. For functional groups expressed in each transition, the <b>motifs</b> tended to be similar. Upstream <b>motifs</b> in some functional groups showed 'positional conservation' by occurring at similar positions relative to the translational start site (TLS); this increases their significance as regulatory <b>motifs.</b> In the ribonucleotide synthesis, mitochondrial, proteasome and organellar translation machinery genes, G-rich, C-rich, CACA and TGTG <b>motifs,</b> respectively, occur with striking positional conservation. In the organellar translation machinery group, G-rich <b>motifs</b> occur close to the TLS. The same <b>motifs</b> were sometimes identified for multiple functional groups; differences in location and abundance of the <b>motifs</b> appear to ensure different modes of action.
