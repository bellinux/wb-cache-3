50|$|Oxypertine (Equipertine, Forit, Integrin, Lanturil, Lotawin, Opertil) is an {{antipsychotic}} used in {{the treatment}} of schizophrenia. It was also evaluated for the treatment of anxiety at a dosage of 20 mg per day. Chemically, it is an indole derivative similarly to <b>molindone</b> {{and a member of the}} phenylpiperazine class. Like reserpine and tetrabenazine, oxypertine depletes catecholamines, though not serotonin, possibly underlying its neuroleptic efficacy. The molecular structure is strongly similar to solypertine and milipertine.|$|E
50|$|Condensation of oximinoketone 2 (from {{nitrosation}} of 3-pentanone), with cyclohexane-1,3-dione (1) in {{the presence}} of zinc and acetic acid leads directly to the partly reduced indole derivative 6. The transformation may be rationalized by assuming as the first step, reduction of 2 to the corresponding α-aminoketone. Conjugate addition of the amine to 1 followed by elimination of hydroxide (as water) would give ene-aminoketone 3. This enamine may be assumed to be in tautomeric equilibrium with imine 4. Aldol condensation of the side chain carbonyl group with the doubly activated ring methylene group would then result in cyclization to pyrrole 5; simple tautomeric transformation would then give the observed product. Mannich reaction of 6 with formaldehyde and morpholine gives the tranquilizer <b>molindone</b> (7).|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} N,N-dimethyltryptamine on {{electrically}} evoked potentials {{in the visual}} system of the cat and the interaction of selected neuroleptic agents with dimethyltryptamine were studied.

40|$|Neuroleptics {{have proven}} {{effective}} {{for the overall}} treatment of schizophrenia. The neuroleptic therapy of schizophrenia, however, has been limited by tardive dyskinesia and by the relative inability of neuroleptics to ameliorate the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Intensive {{research has been conducted}} to identify atypical neuroleptics which would not cause TD and which would have relatively greater efficacy in treating negative symptoms. Based upon animal models of TD and negative symptoms, four neuroleptics have been identified which may have these properties: clozapine, thioridazine, sulpiride, and <b>molindone.</b> Clinical studies of TD suggest that these four potentially atypical agents may have lower dyskinetic potential than typical neuroleptics. Additionally, clinical studies of negative symptoms suggest that <b>molindone</b> and sulpiride, but not clozapine or thioridazine may preferentially treat depressive-like negative schizophrenic symptomatology. The atypical effects of clozapine, thioridazine, sulpiride and <b>molindone,</b> suggest that they may have a distinct place in the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Atypical (second-generation) {{antipsychotics}} {{are considered}} standard treatment {{for children and}} adolescents with early-onset schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. However, the superiority of second-generation antipsychotics over first-generation antipsychotics has not been demonstrated. This study compared the efficacy and safety of two second-generation antipsychotics (olanzapine and risperidone) with a first-generation antipsychotic (<b>molindone)</b> {{in the treatment of}} early-onset schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. METHOD: This double-blind multisite trial randomly assigned pediatric patients with early-onset schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder to treatment with either olanzapine (2. 5 - 20 mg/day), risperidone (0. 5 - 6 mg/day), or <b>molindone</b> (10 - 140 mg/day, plus 1 mg/day of benztropine) for 8 weeks.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{long-term}} {{safety and efficacy}} of three antipsychotics in early-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders. METHOD: Patients (8 to 19 years old) who had improved during an 8 -week, randomized, double-blind acute trial of olanzapine, risperidone, or <b>molindone</b> (plus benztropine) were eligible to continue on the same medication for up to 44 additional weeks under double-blind conditions. Adjunctive medications were allowed according to defined algorithms. Standardized symptom, safety, and functional assessments were conducted every 4 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 116 youths randomized in the acute trial, 54 entered maintenance treatment (<b>molindone,</b> n = 20; olanzapine, n = 13; risperidone, n = 21). Fourteen (26 %) completed 44 weeks of treatment. Adverse effects (n = 15), inadequate efficacy (n = 14), or study nonadherence (n = 8) were the most common reasons for discontinuation. The three treatment arms did not significantly differ in symptom decrease or time to discontinuation. Akathisia was more common with <b>molindone</b> and elevated prolactin concentrations more common with risperidone. Although weight gain and metabolic adverse events had occurred more often with olanzapine and risperidone during the acute trial, no significant between-drug differences emerged {{in most of these}} parameters during maintenance treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Only 12 % of youths with early-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders continued on their originally randomized treatment at 52 weeks. No agent demonstrated superior efficacy, and all were associated with side effects, including weight gain. Improved treatments are needed for early-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

40|$|The {{endogenous}} {{concentrations of}} p- and m-hydroxyphenylacetic acid in the mouse caudate nucleus {{were determined by}} a gas chromatographic or a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric technique and the concentrations were about 30 and 11 ng g- 1 respectively. The subcutaneous administration of (+) -butaclamol (1 mg kg- 1), haloperidol (5 mg kg- 1), <b>molindone</b> (100 mg kg- 1), sulpiride (50 mg kg- 1) or chlorpromazine (20 mg kg- 1) increased the concentration of mouse striatal p- and m-hydroxyphenylacetic acid; the effects were observed at 2 h after drug administration. Lower doses of chlorpromazine (2 mg kg- 1), haloperidol (0. 2 mg kg- 1) and <b>molindone</b> (2 mg kg- 1) did not affect p- or m-hydroxyphenylacetic acid concentrations. The time course for the concentration changes produced by chlorpromazine (20 mg kg- 1) revealed that {{the formation of the}} metabolites occurred within 30 min after its administration and that their efflux from the caudate nucleus took at least 4 h for p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and more than 8 h for m-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. Promethazine and (-) -butaclamol which have chemical structures related to chlorpromazine or (+) -butaclamol respectively but which lack antipsychotic activity, produced no effect on striatal p- or m-hydroxyphenylacetic acid concentrations. The results suggest that antipsychotic drugs increase the utilization of mouse striatal p- and m-tyramine and that after use the amines are metabolized by monoamine oxidase to form p- or m-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. The synthesis of the acid metabolites occurs within 30 min after chlorpromazine administration and their efflux from the caudate nucleus takes from 4 - 8 h...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The Treatment of Early Onset Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders Study is a {{publicly}} funded clinical trial designed {{to compare the}} therapeutic benefits, safety, and tolerability of risperidone, olanzapine, and <b>molindone</b> in youths with early-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The rationale, design, and methods of the Treatment of Early Onset Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders Study are described. METHOD: Using a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group design at four sites, youths with EOSS (ages 8 - 19 years) were assigned to an 8 -week acute trial of risperidone (0. 5 - 6. 0 mg/day), olanzapine (2. 5 - 20 mg/day), or <b>molindone</b> (10 - 140 mg/day). Responders continued double-blind treatment for 44 weeks. The primary outcome measure was responder status at 8 weeks, defined by a 20 % reduction in baseline Positive and Negative Symptom Scale scores plus ratings of significant improvement on the Clinical Global Impressions. Secondary outcome measures included assessments of psychopathology, functional impairment, quality of life, and medication safety. An intent-to-treat analytic plan was used. RESULTS: From February 2002 to May 2006, 476 youths were screened, 173 were further evaluated, and 119 were randomized. Several significant study modifications were required to address safety, the use of adjunctive medications, and the termination of the olanzapine treatment arm due to weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: The Treatment of Early Onset Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders Study will inform clinical practice {{regarding the use of}} antipsychotic medications for youths with early-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Important safety concerns emerged during the study, including higher than anticipated rates of suicidality and problems tapering thymoleptic agents before randomization...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we review the {{empirical}} literature on weight gain associated with neuroleptic drug use.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess neurocognitive {{outcomes}} following antipsychotic {{intervention in}} youth {{enrolled in the}} National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) -funded Treatment of Early-Onset Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (TEOSS). METHOD: Neurocognitive functioning of youth (ages 8 to 19 years) with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder was evaluated in a four-site, randomized, double-blind clinical trial comparing <b>molindone,</b> olanzapine, and risperidone. The primary outcomes were overall group change from baseline in neurocognitive composite and six domain scores after 8 weeks and continued treatment up to 52 weeks. Age and sex were included as covariates in all analyses. RESULTS: Of 116 TEOSS participants, 77 (66 %) had post-baseline neurocognitive data. No significant differences emerged in the neurocognitive outcomes of the three medication groups. Therefore, the three treatment groups were combined into one group to assess overall neurocognitive outcomes. Significant modest improvements were observed in the composite score and in three of six domain scores in the acute phase, and in four of six domain scores in the combined acute and maintenance phases. Partial correlation analyses revealed very few relationships among Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) baseline or change scores and neurocognition change scores. CONCLUSIONS: Antipsychotic intervention in youth with early-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders (EOSS) led to modest improvement in measures of neurocognitive function. The changes in cognition were largely unrelated to baseline symptoms or symptom change. Small treatment effect sizes, easily accounted for by practice effects, highlight the critical need {{for the development of}} more efficacious interventions for the enduring neurocognitive deficits seen in EOSS.

40|$|Sodium ion (Na+) {{influences}} binding of both dopamine agonists and antagonists to D 2 receptors in striatum and retina. Also, Na+ markedly potentiates {{the loss}} of high-affinity agonist binding due to the GTP analogue p[NH]ppG. 2 -Amino- 6, 7 -dihydroxy- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro[5, 8 - 3 H]naphthalene ([3 H]ADTN) binds exclusively to an agonist conformation of D 2 receptor in both striatum and retina, distinct from the antagonist conformation labeled by [3 H]spiroperidol or [3 H]domperidone in striatum or by [3 H]spiroperidol in retina. Na+ is not required for interaction of [3 H]ADTN or antagonist radioligand sites with the selective D 2 agonist LY- 141865, the D 2 antagonist domperidone, or nonselective dopamine agonists or antagonists; however, Na+ is necessary for high affinity interaction of those radioligand sites with the D 2 antagonists <b>molindone</b> and metoclopramide. With Na+ present, striatal sites for [3 H]ADTN, [3 H]spiroperidol, and [3 H]domperidone have similar affinities for antagonists but only [3 H]ADTN sites have high affinity for agonists. Na+ further decreases the low affinity of dopamine agonists for [3 H]spiroperidol binding sites. Also, Na+ enhances [3 H]spiroperidol and decreases [3 H]ADTN binding. Na+ alone causes bound [3 H]ADTN to dissociate from at least 30 % of striatal and 50 % of retinal sites, and with Na+ present [3 H]ADTN rapidly dissociates from the remaining sites upon addition of p[NH]ppG. It is proposed that D 2 receptors in striatum and retina exist in distinct but interconvertible conformational states, with different properties depending on {{the presence or absence}} of Na+ and of guanine nucleotide...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between binding of antipsychotic drugs and sigma psychotomimetic opiates to binding {{sites for the}} sigma agonist (+) -[3 H]SKF 10, 047 (N-allylnormetazocine) and to dopamine D 2 sites was investigated. In guinea pig brain membranes, (+) -[3 H]SKF 10, 047 bound to a single class of sites with a Kd of 4 X 10 (- 8) M and a Bmax of 333 fmol/mg of protein. This binding was different from mu, kappa, or delta opiate receptor binding. It was inhibited by opiates that produce psychotomimetic activities but not by opiates that lack such activities. Some antipsychotic drugs inhibited (+) -[3 H]SKF 10, 047 binding with high to moderate affinities {{in the following order}} of potency: haloperidol greater than perphenazine greater than fluphenazine greater than acetophenazine greater than trifluoperazine greater than <b>molindone</b> {{greater than or equal to}} pimozide greater than or equal to thioridazine greater than or equal to chlorpromazine greater than or equal to triflupromazine. However, there were other antipsychotic drugs such as spiperone and clozapine that showed low affinity for the (+) -[3 H]SKF 10, 047 binding sites. Affinities of antipsychotic drugs for (+) -[3 H]SKF 10, 047 binding sites did not correlate with those for [3 H]spiperone (dopamine D 2) sites. [3 H]-Haloperidol binding in whole brain membranes was also inhibited by the sigma opiates pentazocine, cyclazocine, and (+) -SKF 10, 047. In the striatum, about half of the saturable [3 H]haloperidol binding was to [3 H]spiperone (D 2) sites and the other half was to sites similar to (+) -[3 H]SKF 10, 047 binding sites...|$|E

Few treatments have demonstrated efficacy in rigorous clinical trials. Enduring response to current medications appears limited. Recently, olanzapine was approved {{for the treatment of}} adolescents with schizophrenia or acute manic/mixed episodes in pedBP. Methods: PubMed searches were conducted for olanzapine combined with pharmacology, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder. Searches related to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were limited to children and adolescents. The bibliographies of the retrieved articles were hand-checked for additional relevant studies. The epidemiology, phenomenology, and treatment of EOSS and pedBP, and olanzapine&rsquo;s pharmacology are reviewed. Studies of olanzapine treatment in youth with EOSS and pedBP are examined. Results: Olanzapine is efficacious for EOSS and pedBP. However, olanzapine is not more efficacious than risperidone, <b>molindone,</b> or haloperidol in EOSS and is less efficacious than clozapine in treatment-resistant EOSS. No comparative trials have been done in pedBP. Olanzapine is associated with weight gain, dyslipidemia, and transaminase elevations in youth. Extrapyramidal symptoms, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and blood dyscrasias have also been reported but appear rare. Conclusions: The authors conclude that olanzapine should be considered a second-line agent in EOSS and pedBP due to its risks for significant weight gain and lipid dysregulation. Awareness of the consistent weight and metabolic changes observed in olanzapine-treated youth focused attention on the potential long-term risks of atypical antipsychotics in youth.
