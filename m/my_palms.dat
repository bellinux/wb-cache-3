BJ Hickman, an intervention expert who appeared in two episodes, noticed Goldstein [...] "had a moment" [...] holding the crack pipe, and later {{felt the need to}} call his sponsor. Goldstein later said of the experience: [...] "I realized <b>my</b> <b>palms</b> were sweaty and I was like, wait a minute, this is not smart for me to be holding this." [...] In another episode, a police officer shows Goldstein confiscated drugs, including a bag of crack cocaine. Shortly thereafter, Goldstein leaves the building, informing the camera crew that he felt so tempted to consume the drugs that it was not safe for him to remain there.|$|E

60|$|THE SHE-ANCIENT. One day, when I {{was tired}} of {{learning}} to walk forward with some of my feet and backwards with others and sideways with the rest all at once, I sat on a rock with my four chins resting on four of <b>my</b> <b>palms,</b> and four or my elbows resting on four of my knees.

60|$|But {{the beams}} or cleats I found myself on {{were not the}} broad, generous ones that at that time were usually on box-cars. On the contrary, they were very narrow--not more than {{an inch and a}} half in breadth. I couldn't get half of the width of my sole on them. Then there was nothing to which to hold with my hands. True, there were the ends of the two box-cars; but those ends were flat, {{perpendicular}} surfaces. There were no grips. I could only press the flats of <b>my</b> <b>palms</b> against the car-ends for support. But that would have been all right if the cleats for my feet had been decently wide.|$|E
60|$|All very foolish, you say. No doubt, but it {{interested}} me and I was {{of an age}} when very few things {{interested me}} vitally. With clothing black as soot, with hands brown with stain and skinned and swollen and feverish, I kept to my job without regard to Sundays or the ordinary hours of labor. I was not seeking sympathy,--I was renewing my youth. I was both artist and workman. My muscles hardened, <b>my</b> <b>palms</b> broadened, my appetite became prodigious. I lost all fear of indigestion and ate anything which my friend Dudley {{was good enough to}} provide.

One thing I saw plainly: I must not simply retreat before him, or he would speedily hold me boxed into the bows, as a moment since he had so nearly boxed me in the stern. Once so caught, and nine or ten inches of the blood-stained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity. I placed <b>my</b> <b>palms</b> against the main-mast, which was of a goodish bigness, and waited, every nerve upon the stretch.|$|E

6000|$|But his laugh! It irritated me, maddened me, {{as nothing}} else {{under the sun}} could irritate or madden me. It haunted me, gripped hold of me, and would not let me go. It was a huge, Gargantuan laugh. Waking or {{sleeping}} it was always with me, whirring and jarring across my heart-strings like an enormous rasp. At break of day it came whooping across the fields to spoil my pleasant morning revery. Under the aching noonday glare, when the green things drooped and the birds withdrew to {{the depths of the}} forest, and all nature drowsed, his great [...] "Ha! ha!" [...] and [...] "Ho! ho!" [...] rose up to the sky and challenged the sun. And at black midnight, from the lonely cross-roads where he turned from town into his own place, came his plaguey cachinnations to rouse me from my sleep and make me writhe and clench my nails into <b>my</b> <b>palms.</b>|$|E
6000|$|There {{were other}} open spaces {{covered with a}} {{vegetation}} almost as interesting as the canes and the trees: this was where what were called [...] "weeds" [...] were allowed to flourish. Here were the thorn-apple, chenopodium, sow-thistle, wild mustard, redweed, viper's bugloss, and others, both native and introduced, in dense thickets five or six feet high. It was difficult to push one's way through these thickets, and one was always in dread of treading on a snake. At another spot fennel flourished by itself, {{as if it had}} some mysterious power, perhaps its peculiar smell, of keeping other plants at a proper distance. It formed quite a thicket, and grew to a height of ten or twelve feet. This spot was a favourite haunt of mine, as it was in a waste place at the furthest point from the house, a wild solitary spot where I could spend long hours by myself watching the birds. But I also loved the fennel for itself, its beautiful green feathery foliage and the smell of it, also the taste, so that whenever I visited that secluded spot I would rub the crushed leaves in <b>my</b> <b>palms</b> and chew the small twigs for their peculiar fennel flavour.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought the}} {{intrusion}} singular enough, but never harboured {{for a moment}} the idea that what I saw was anything more than the mortal form of some old woman about the establishment, who had a fancy to dress like her grandmother, and who, having perhaps (as your lordship mentioned that you were rather straitened for room) been dislodged from her chamber for my accommodation, had forgotten the circumstance, and returned by twelve to her old haunt. Under this persuasion I moved myself in bed and coughed a little, to make the intruder sensible of my being in possession of the premises. She turned slowly round, but, gracious Heaven! my lord, what a countenance did she display to me! There was no longer any question what she was, or any thought of her being a living being. Upon a face which wore the fixed features of a corpse were imprinted the traces of the vilest and most hideous passions which had animated her while she lived. The body of some atrocious criminal seemed to have been given up from the grave, and the soul restored from the penal fire, in order to form for a space a union with the ancient accomplice of its guilt. I started up in bed, and sat upright, supporting myself on <b>my</b> <b>palms,</b> as I gazed on this horrible spectre. The hag made, as it seemed, a single and swift stride to the bed where I lay, and squatted herself down upon it, in precisely the same attitude which I had assumed in the extremity of horror, advancing her diabolical countenance within half a yard of mine, with a grin which seemed to intimate the malice and the derision of an incarnate fiend." ...|$|E

3000|$|Challenging tasks with {{gloved hands}} include a {{majority}} of essential movements requiring hand motions such as using a walkie-talkie, carrying, holding and using tools or hoses etc. In particular, holding a hose (approximately 45  kg of pressure at the tip) with gloved hands is very challenging due to poor grip in the palm and fingers. A male firefighter elucidated the situation as such: “There’s almost no grip on <b>my</b> <b>palm</b> right now. Even though it’s resting on <b>my</b> <b>palm,</b> all the grip is in the fingers. I can’t grip the hose with my gloves. I grip it with my body and my arm. If I try to hold it just with my glove, it will slide (Site # 6).” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} place much {{dependence}} on my present recollection," [...] I frankly responded, [...] "but I {{reported on the}} case at once while my mind was most accurate as to details. Speaking further of these tricks, {{if you choose to}} call them such, I have had several failures, where the failure meant as much as a success. I have held two slates with a psychic (while we were both standing) when the creaking and scratching and grinding went on between my hands. I give you my word I was convinced at the moment of holding between <b>my</b> <b>palms</b> a sentient force. I felt as Franklin must have felt when he played with the lightning in the bottle at the tail of his kite. Once I heard the writing going on in a half-opened slate, but I did not see the pencil in motion. Some of these cases of 'direct-writing' are the most convincing of all my experiences. People ask me why I didn't talk with the spirits about heaven and angels. I was not interested in their religious notions. I kept to this one line--I wanted to see a particle of matter move from A to B without a known push or pull. I paid very little attention to 'trance-mediums' like Mrs. Piper; and although I saw a great deal of what is called 'mind-reading' and 'thought-transference,' I did not permit the cart to get before the horse. 'Independent slate-writing' interested me, for the reason that I could put the clamps on it. Materialization, on the contrary, is so staged and arranged for that to prove its genuineness seems impossible at present; but slate-writing under your hand is a different matter." ...|$|E
60|$|In this {{direction}} I had been pushing resolutely on for over half an hour, finding it no easy matter {{to make my}} way without constantly deviating to this side or that from the course I wished to keep, when I came to a much more open spot. The trees were smaller and scantier here, owing to the rocky nature of the ground, which sloped rather rapidly down; but it was moist and overgrown with mosses, ferns, creepers, and low shrubs, all of the liveliest green. I could not see many yards ahead owing to the bushes and tall fern fronds; but presently I began to hear a low, continuous sound, which, when I had advanced twenty or thirty yards further, I made {{out to be the}} gurgling of running water; and at the same moment I made the discovery that my throat was parched and <b>my</b> <b>palms</b> tingling with heat. I hurried on, promising myself a cool draught, when all at once, above the soft dashing and gurgling of the water, I caught yet another sound--a low, warbling note, or succession of notes, which might have been emitted by a bird. But it startled me nevertheless--bird-like warbling sounds had come to mean so much to me--and pausing, I listened intently. It was not repeated, and finally, treading with the utmost caution so as not to alarm the mysterious vocalist, I crept on until, coming to a greenheart with a quantity of feathery foliage of a shrub growing about its roots, I saw that just beyond the tree the ground was more open still, letting in the sunlight from above, and that the channel of the stream I sought was in this open space, about twenty yards from me, although the water was still hidden from sight. Something else was there, which I did see; instantly my cautious advance was arrested. I stood gazing with concentrated vision, scarcely daring to breathe lest I should scare it away.|$|E
