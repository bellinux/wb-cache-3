40|$|Methods Throughout the Nov- 07 /Jan- 08 time period, 60 class-V restorations {{have been}} performed. In {{order to be}} part of the study, every patient was to need at least 2 restorations on vital teeth, which had to be located on {{opposite}} quadrants of the oral cavity. All the restorations were made with micro-layering technique using Swiss <b>Master</b> <b>Light</b> (EMS) curing light (800 mW/cm 2 for 20 s). The test groups were randomly assigned to the class V cavities using composite and adhesive materials as follows: A) testing material - Venus-Diamond and GlumaComfortBond (Heraeus) B) competitor - CeramX-Duo and Prime&Bond-NT (Dentsply) A quadrant-based randomization was used to assign to every restoration its filling material and adhesive system: restorations have been performed according to the adhesive dentistry techniques by one expert clinician (> 10 years of clinical experience). Each restoration was polished with the 2 -step polishing system provided by Heraeus Kulzer (pre-polisher and high-gloss finisher).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Orthodontic {{brackets}} {{are routinely}} bonded with light-cured adhesives. Conventional halogen lights used in bonding have {{the disadvantage of}} a long curing time, and the available alternatives (laser and plasma lights) are expensive. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} minimum time necessary to bond brackets with a new, relatively low-priced, high-power halogen light. METHODS: Five groups of 15 deciduous bovine incisors were bonded with stainless steel brackets (Mini Diamond Twin, Ormco, Orange, Calif) by using different lamps and curing times. Three of the groups were bonded by using a high-power halogen light (Swiss <b>Master</b> <b>Light,</b> Electro Medical Systems, Nyon, Switzerland) for 2, 3, and 6 seconds, respectively. The fourth group, bonded with a fast halogen light (Optilux 501, Sybron Dental Specialties, Danbury, Conn) for 40 seconds, served as the positive control group. The fifth group, the comparison group, was bonded with a plasma light (Remecure, Remedent, Deurle, Belgium) for 4 seconds. After storage for 24 hours in the dark at 37 degrees C in water, shear bond strength was measured with a universal testing machine. RESULTS: A curing time of 2 seconds with the high-power halogen light negatively affected the bond strength and the probability of bond survival. The adhesive remnant index scores were not significantly different among the groups. Most failures (> 60...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the ability of an {{infrared}} (IR) camera to assess temperature changes and distributions in teeth below restorations when quartz-tungsten-halogen (QTH) and light-emitting diode (LED) curing lights were used to photopolymerize the restorative material. Our hypothesis was that the higher power density and broader spectral distribution of the QTH source would cause greater increases in tooth temperature than the LED source, and that these differences would be best demonstrated with the IR camera. Cavities were prepared on human third molars and restored with a resin composite restorative material. The material was light-cured using three light-curing sources using several exposure times. The external (outside the tooth) and internal (inside the pulp chamber) temperature changes during polymerization of the composite material were recorded over 360 s with thermocouples and an IR camera. Using thermocouples the maximum increase in external temperature (+ 17. 7 degrees C) was reported for the Swiss <b>Master</b> <b>light</b> after 20 s of curing time while the minimum temperature rise (+ 7. 8 degrees C) was reported for the Freelight 2. Whereas a 2. 6 degrees C increase in internal temperature was observed after curing 20 s with the Freelight 2, 7. 1 degrees C was reported after 60 s of light exposure to Astralis 10. Infrared images showed similar trends in external-internal rises in temperature as the thermocouples, although temperatures measured by the IR were generally higher. These results indicate that the higher power density QTH sources caused greater increases in tooth temperatures than the LED source and that thermocouples may underestimate the heat applied to the tooth...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{test the}} {{influence}} of photoinitiator type and filler particle inclusion on the validity of exposure reciprocity law. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 50 / 50 wt% Bis-GMA/TEGDMA resins were prepared with equimolar concentrations of camphorquinone/DMAEMA (0. 20 / 0. 80 mass%) (CQ) or Lucirin-TPO (0. 42 mass%), and were used either unfilled or filled to 75 mass%. Specimens were cured with a halogen Swiss <b>Master</b> <b>Light</b> (EMS, Switzerland) using four different curing protocols: 400 mW/cm(2) for 45 s as reference protocol (18 J/cm(2)), 1500 mW/cm(2) for 12 s (18 J/cm(2)), 3000 mW/cm(2) for 6 s (18 J/cm(2)) and 3 s (9 J/cm(2)). Degree of conversion (DC) was measured in real time for 70 s by FT-NIRS and temperature rise using a thermocouple. Depth of cure was determined with a penetrometer technique. RESULTS: With respect to DC and depth of cure, exposure reciprocity law did not hold for any tested material, except for the depth of cure of filled CQ-based materials. At similar radiant exposure, DC was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) for all unfilled and filled TPO-based materials compared with CQ-based materials. As exposure time was reduced and irradiance increased, TPO-based materials exhibited higher DC whilst an opposite trend was observed for CQ-based materials (p< 0. 05). For similar curing regimes, depth of cure of CQ-based materials remained significantly {{greater than that of}} TPO-based materials. Adding fillers generally reduced DC, except at higher irradiance for CQ-based materials where a positive effect was observed (p< 0. 05). SIGNIFICANCE: The validity of exposure reciprocity law was dependent on several factors, among which photoinitiator type and filler content were important. Lucirin-TPO is a highly reactive and efficient photoinitiator, which may allow the potential for a reduction in curing time of TPO-based photoactive materials in thin sections...|$|E
