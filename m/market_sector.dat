50|$|Economic impacts are {{expected}} to vary regionally. For a medium increase in global mean temperature (2-3 °C of warming, relative to the average temperature between 1990-2000), <b>market</b> <b>sectors</b> in low-latitude and less-developed areas might experience net costs due to climate change. On the other hand, <b>market</b> <b>sectors</b> in high-latitude and developed regions might experience net benefits for this level of warming. A global mean temperature increase above about 2-3 °C (relative to 1990-2000) would very likely result in <b>market</b> <b>sectors</b> across all regions experiencing either declines in net benefits or rises in net costs.|$|R

25|$|IPCC (2001, p.74) {{compared}} their literature {{assessment of}} the aggregate <b>market</b> <b>sector</b> impacts of climate change against projections of future increases in global mean temperature. Temperature projections {{were based on the}} six illustrative SRES emissions scenarios. Projections for the year 2025 ranged from 0.4 to 1.1°C. For 2050, projections ranged from 0.8 to 2.6°C, and for 2100, 1.4 to 5.8°C. These temperature projections correspond to atmospheric CO2 concentrations of 405–460ppm for the year 2025, 445–640ppm for 2050, and 540–970ppm for 2100.|$|E

25|$|Volkswagen {{entered the}} {{supermini}} market in 1975 with the Volkswagen Polo, a stylish and spacious three-door hatchback designed by Bertone. It {{was a strong}} seller in West Germany {{and most of the}} rest of Western Europe, being one of the first foreign small cars to prove popular in Britain. It had started out in 1974 as the Audi 50, which was only available in certain markets and was less popular. The Polo entered a <b>market</b> <b>sector</b> already being dominated by the Fiat 127 and Renault 5, and which before long would also include the Austin Metro and Ford Fiesta.|$|E
25|$|Smith et al. (2001, p.958) {{assessed}} {{the literature on}} the aggregate impacts of climate change. With medium confidence, they concluded that a small increase in global average temperature (up to 2°C, measured against 1990 levels) would result in an aggregate <b>market</b> <b>sector</b> impact of plus or minus a few percent of world GDP. Smith et al. (2001) found that for a small to medium (2-3°C) global average temperature increase, some studies predicted small net positive market impacts. Most studies they assessed predicted net damages beyond a medium temperature increase, with further damages for greater (more than 3°C) temperature rises.|$|E

25|$|The Hoa were {{notoriously}} enterprising entrepreneurs that traded {{and manufactured}} {{a myriad of}} good and services of value ranging from fine Chinese silk to black incense. The monopolized gold export trade was entirely in Chinese hands in addition to Chinese domination of local trade in paper, tea, pepper, arms, sulphur, lead, and lead oxide. The economic clout held by the Hoa coupled with repeated attempts by China to conquer and dominate Vietnam inflamed anti-Chinese hostility, bitterness, and resentment from the indigenous Vietnamese Kinh majority. Hostility against the ethnic Chinese minority resulted in violence, including the infamous 1782 massacre of some 2000 Hoa in Cholon, Saigon's Chinatown. By the time the French arrived in the mid-18th century, Hoa held a controlled and dominated the indigenous Vietnamese majority in trade, mining, and every urban <b>market</b> <b>sector</b> in addition to prospering under the colonial laissez faire market policies enshrined by the French colonialists. In addition, Hoa also served as intermediaries operating as agents for the French {{as well as their}} own. Hoa also collaborated with the French and other European capitalists in tapping the natural riches and exploiting the native Kinh Vietnamese via the laissez faire economic system to become wealthy. Under French rule, the collection of paddy in the Mekong delta was completely under Chinese hands who resold it to French companies for export. Industrial commodities imported from France by French companies in Vietnam were retailed to the rural population in the South by Hoa merchants, with some of them holding exclusive distribution rights. By the 1930s, gaps between the large-scale manufacturing, commercial, and financial enterprises held by the French were filled by smaller businesses controlled by the Chinese. Favorable economic policies attracted a rapid influx of Chinese immigrants seeking their financial destiny through business success until the mid-twentieth century. Between 1925 to 1933, some 600,000 Han Chinese immigrants settled in Vietnam. Hoa merchants delved into the rice, liquor, opium and spice trade, where they set up plantations in the rural hinterlands of the Mekong delta and sold its products in Cholon. In the north, the Hoa were mainly rice farmers, fishermen, and coal miners, except for those residing in cities and provincial towns. The French regularly worked with Chinese businessmen in the agriculture and heavy industry sectors, and the latter often served as middlemen to liaise between themselves and the French in the domestic trade.|$|E
