40|$|Abstract A {{low-cost}} experimental apparatus {{has been}} developed to investigate the Mode I fatigue crack growth behavior of thin <b>metallic</b> <b>foils</b> and sheets. The apparatus utilizes magnetic coupling between a ceramic magnet and a rotating steel disk to induce cyclic tensile loads in notched rectangular test specimens.

Experiments were performed at ambient temperature using a loading frequency of 2 Hz and a nominal stress ratio of 0. 1. The cyclic crack growth data could be fit to a Paris relationship between crack growth rate and stress-intensity range.
