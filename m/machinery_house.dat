50|$|In the 1980s a {{new type}} of machine made its appearance. In an attempt to correct {{problems}} of turbulence and resulting discomfort from swimming against a jet of water, systems were devised to set the water in motion in a smoother fashion. The first, in 1984, was the SwimEx, developed by Stan Charren together with two MIT-trained engineers. This machine, consisting of a fiberglass pool with the <b>machinery</b> <b>housed</b> in an adjacent compartment, sets the water in motion by means of a paddlewheel, thus generating a steady stream of water as wide as the swimming pool itself.|$|R
5000|$|A {{gantry crane}} has a hoist in a fixed <b>machinery</b> <b>house</b> or on a trolley that runs {{horizontally}} along rails, usually fitted {{on a single}} beam (mono-girder) or two beams (twin-girder). The crane frame is supported on a gantry system with equalized beams and wheels that run on the gantry rail, usually perpendicular to the trolley travel direction. These cranes come in all sizes, and some can move very heavy loads, particularly the extremely large examples used in shipyards or industrial installations. A special version is the container crane (or [...] "Portainer" [...] crane, named by the first manufacturer), designed for loading and unloading ship-borne containers at a port.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{account of}} the British high mast in its fully developed state at Cardington, and its operation, is abridged from Masefield.Mooring masts were developed {{to act as a}} safe open harbour to which airships could be moored or unmoored in any weather, and at which they could receive (hydrogen or helium) gas, fuel, stores and payload.The Cardington mast, completed in 1926, was an eight sided steel girder structure, 200 ft high, tapering from 70 ft diameter at ground level to 26 ft at the passenger platform, 170 ft from the ground. Above the passenger platform was the 30 ft of the conical housing for the mooring gear. A lower platform 142 ft above the ground accommodated searchlights and signalling gear in a gallery 4 ft wide.The top platform, at the height of 170 ft, from which passengers embarked and disembarked to and from the airships, was 40 ft in diameter and encircled by a heavy parapet. The top rail of the parapet formed a track on which a gangway, let down from the airship, ran on wheels to give freedom for the airship to move around the tower as it swung with the wind. An electric passenger lift ran up the centre of the tower, encircled by a stairway to provide foot access.The upper portion of the tower, from the passenger platform upwards, was a circular steel turret surmounted by a truncated cone with its top 23 ft above the passenger platform. A three-part telescopic arm, mounted on gimbals, projected through an opening at the top, free to swing from the vertical in any direction up to 30 degrees of movement. The top of the arm consisted of a bell-shaped cup mounted to rotate on ball bearings.A cable extended through the bell-mouth which, linked to a cable dropped from airship to be moored, enabled the nose of the airship to be drawn down until a cone on the nose locked home into the cup and so secured the airship to the tower. The telescopic arm was then centred, locked in the vertical position, and made free to rotate on a vertical axis so the airship could swing, nose to tower, in any direction of the wind.In the <b>machinery</b> <b>house</b> {{at the base of the}} tower three steam-driven winches operated the hauling gear through drums 5 ft in diameter to give cable hauling speeds of 50 feet a minute.|$|E

30|$|The {{protection}} circuit proposed {{in this paper}} {{can be used to}} protect the costly electrical appliances from abnormal conditions like sag, swell, under voltage, over voltage, over current and able to avoid appliances being get damaged from harmful effects. The advantages of this protective device are: highly sensitive, fit and forget system, low cost and reliable circuit, complete elimination of manpower, can handle heavy loads up to 7 A, auto switch OFF during abnormal conditions and auto switch ON at the time of normal conditions. The applications of this protection device are in industrial <b>machinery,</b> <b>house</b> hold appliances like: TV, refrigerator, air conditioner, agriculture motors, and water pumps. This device can also be used directly as standalone equipment between the supply mains and the load. The over/under voltage and over current cut-off with time delay provides over/under-voltage and over current protection and also protection against any transients. If tap changing transformer is used and is automatically controlled, then the device can operate the load normally during under voltage and over voltage condition. Hence, we can protect as well as operate the load in abnormal conditions also. The proposed system can be further improved by integrating it with GSM modem that alerts user by sending an SMS about the tripping status.|$|E

40|$|The de novo {{construction}} of cellular life requires, in part, {{the assembly of}} components that confer the ability to replicate. Herein we describe efforts to reconstitute parts of the Escherichia coli cell division machinery inside of water-in-oil emulsion compartments and synthetic phospholipid vesicles. The system was built with DNA and purified transcription and translation <b>machinery</b> <b>housed</b> in a compartment. A particular {{emphasis was placed on}} FtsZ, a protein that oligomerizes into a ring at the midcell and splits the cell into two. FtsZ does not contain a membrane interaction domain. In vivo, FtsZ interactions with the membrane are mediated by FtsA and ZipA. Therefore, the influence of FtsA on the behavior of FtsZ also was investigated. Fluorescently tagged constructs were used to facilitate evaluation by microscopy. The data showed that FtsZ readily assembles into rings in the presence of FtsA, thereby suggesting that the Fts system can be exploited for building a genetically encoded, self-replicating, cell-like system. We also explored additional methods of dividing compartments, {{such as the use of}} aqueous two and three phase systems...|$|R
