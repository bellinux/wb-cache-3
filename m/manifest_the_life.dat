Just as importantly, {{it is possible}} to say that Christians can learn from other religions or atheistic humanism because God's grace is and can be operative in them. The presence of Christ in other religions operates in and through his Spirit (Rahner, p. 316) and non-Christians respond to the grace of God through [...] "the unreflexive and 'searching Christology'" [...] (searching [...] "memory" [...] of the absolute saviour) present in the hearts of all persons (Rahner, pp. 295, 318). Three specific attitudes become involved: 1) an absolute love towards one's neighbours; 2) an attitude of readiness for death; and 3) an attitude of hope for the future (Rahner, pp. 295-298).

Afterward, he regretted this, even though he had used it in holiness. He knew that his repentance was accepted when later, he found himself again in a similar situation. This time he did not use practical Kabbalah to perform the miracle, but instead used faith to give him the miraculous supernatural power to cross the river. He then knew that his teshuvah was complete.

The first part presents actual findings about families with a child with disability, submits both negative and positive impacts of such coexistence on individual family members, namely on parents, siblings and grandparents. Subsequently it introduces a system approach to studying a family, which understands the family as a complex comprised of interacting units.

On that account it is necessary to define individual family roles properly, which helps ensuring stability and functionality of a family system. Further it comes to conclusion that due to the presence of a handicapped child, changes in the organization of the family system occur; the child turns into a sort of a family center to which others adapt. A child with disability occupies a special status of 'member - non member', because it can be situated neither into basic family subsystems nor into subsystems based on gender. The [...] ...|$|R

Foram sujeitos desse estudo sete atletas de basquetebol que participaram de campeonatos mundiais e/ou olímpicos. O instrumento utilizado foi uma entrevista semi-estruturada e a análise dos resultados foi feita de acordo com os procedimentos propostos por Maxwell (2002). Os resultados apontaram que conforme o princípio da Teoria Bioecológica, a resiliência se manifesta ao longo da vida a partir da interação entre os fatores de risco e de proteção e por ser o esporte de alto rendimento um ambiente que expõe as atletas ao risco e ao estresse, essas tiveram fortalecidas suas características pessoais positivas e rede de apoio social e afetivo eficaz para superar as adversidades e não abandonar a carreira precocemente.
