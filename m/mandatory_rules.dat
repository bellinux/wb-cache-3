25|$|The {{standard}} U.S. {{medical school}} curriculum is four years long. Traditionally, {{the first two}} years are composed mainly of classroom basic science education, while the final two years primarily include rotations in clinical settings where students learn patient care firsthand. Today, clinical education is spread across all four years with the final year containing the most clinical rotation time. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has published <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules,</b> obliging on all inpatient and outpatient teaching settings, laying down the guidelines for what medical students in the United States may do, if they have not completed a clerkship or sub-internship. These rules apply to when they are in the clinical setting in school, not when they are, for example, helping staff events or in other non-formal educational settings, even if they are helping provide certain clinical services along with nurses and the supervising physicians- for example, certain basic screening procedures. In the formal clinical setting in school, they can only assist with certain patient evaluation and management tasks, after the vital signs, chief complaint and the history of present illness have been discerned, but prior to the physical examination: reviewing the patient's signs and symptoms in each body system, and then reviewing the patient's personal medical, genetic, family, educational/occupational, and psychosocial history. The student's supervising physician (or another physician with supervisory privileges if the original doctor is no longer available, for some reason) must be in the room during the student's work, and must conduct this same assessment of the patient before performing the actual physical examination, and after finishing and conferring with the student, will review his or her notes and opinion, editing or correcting them if necessary, and will also have his or her own professional notes; both must then sign and date and I.D. the student's notes and the medical record. They may observe, but not perform, physical examinations, surgeries, endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures, radiological or nuclear medicine procedures, oncology sessions, and obstetrics. The patient must give consent for their presence and participation in his or her care, even at a teaching facility. Depending on the time they have completed in school, their familiarity with the area of medicine and the procedure, and the presence of their supervisor, and any others needed, in the room or nearby, they may be allowed to conduct certain very minor tests associated with the physical examination, such as simple venipuncture blood draws, and electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms, for learning and experience purposes, especially when there is no intern or resident available.|$|E
2500|$|The {{personal}} laws {{will usually}} define status in rem {{so that it}} is recognised wherever the individual may travel subject only to significant public policy limits. Hence, for example, as an aspect of parens patriae, a state will define the age at which a person may marry. If such a limitation could simply be evaded by the young person traveling abroad on a holiday to a country with a lower age limit, this would clearly breach the policy of the [...] "parental" [...] state. The same principle would apply to an adult who wished to create a polygamous marriage or to evade a restriction on consanguinity. In Family Law as opposed to the Law of Contract, there is also a strong case for legal capacity to be universally enforced to limit to ability of individuals to evade normally <b>mandatory</b> <b>rules.</b> The claims of the lex loci celebrationis to apply are weak given that the significance of the location may be no more than the convenience of their laws to those wishing to marry.|$|E

50|$|In legal theory, a default rule is {{a rule of}} {{law that}} can be {{overridden}} by a contract, trust, will, or other legally effective agreement.

One of the most important debates in contract theory concerns the proper role or purpose of default rules.|$|E
40|$|We examine {{two issues}} on duciary duty. First,what is the {{essential}} structure of duciary duty?Second,does duciary duty have elements of a <b>mandatory</b> <b>rule?</b> Concerning the rst question,the formation of a duciary relationship involves the di culty of writing a contract on the acts that the duciary has to do,and the outcomes of the acts. Especially,duciary duty is used when writing a contract on outcomes is so di cult that an outcome-based contract cannot attract an agent. We interpret duciary duty as an attempt at coping with this di culty by (1) a defensive incentive structure that prohibits the misappropriation of the principal's 'asset' by the agent and (2) the court's ex-post supervision on veri able acts of misappropriation. For duciary duty to have elements of a <b>mandatory</b> rule,(1) the <b>rule</b> itself should be clear and speci c and (2) {{the extent that the}} rule applies should be also clear.

40|$|When anyone acquires {{control over}} a listed company the <b>mandatory</b> bid <b>rule</b> is triggered. This means {{that the person who}} acquires the control has to make an offer to buy the {{remaining}} shares in the company. The purpose of the rule is to protect the minority shareholders from the buyers. This rule has been considered to be burdensome and thus it is followed by an exemption rule which under some special circumstances may make the <b>mandatory</b> bid <b>rule</b> void. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze if the exemptions given by the Swedish securities council (in Swedish Aktiemarknadsnämnden) are in accordance with the purpose of the <b>mandatory</b> bid <b>rule</b> and if a review of these rules are needed. To answer the purpose, the Swedish securities councils statements has been analyzed, to determinate if the exemptions are in accordance with the purpose of the <b>mandatory</b> bid <b>rule.</b> The result of the analysis is that the rules need to be changed because exemptions from the <b>mandatory</b> bid <b>rule</b> are given to arbitrary in Sweden...|$|R

At the time of al-Hashimi's appointment, the Turkish government agreed to allow the League of Nations to send a commission to then-British-held Mosul to determine which country its inhabitants favored joining and to make recommendations regarding a final settlement of the territorial dispute. The commission decided in July 1925 that Mosul should remain part of Iraq, that Iraq should remain under British <b>Mandatory</b> <b>rule</b> for 25 years and that Kurdish cultural rights and self-administration be recognized by the Iraqi state. Al-Hashimi was replaced by Abd al-Muhsin as-Sa'dun in June.
