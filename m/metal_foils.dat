5|$|The {{capacitor}} is {{a development}} of the Leyden jar and is a device that can store charge, and thereby storing electrical energy in the resulting field. It consists of two conducting plates separated by a thin insulating dielectric layer; in practice, thin <b>metal</b> <b>foils</b> are coiled together, increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore the capacitance. The unit of capacitance is the farad, named after Michael Faraday, and given the symbol F: one farad is the capacitance that develops a potential difference of one volt when it stores a charge of one coulomb. A capacitor connected to a voltage supply initially causes a current as it accumulates charge; this current will however decay in time as the capacitor fills, eventually falling to zero. A capacitor will therefore not permit a steady state current, but instead blocks it.|$|E
25|$|The highest surge-current rated film {{capacitors}} are film/foil capacitors with a {{metal foil}} construction. These capacitors use thin <b>metal</b> <b>foils,</b> usually aluminum, as the electrodes overlying the polymer film. The advantage of this construction is the easy and robust connection of the metal foil electrodes. In this design, the contact resistance {{in the area of}} the schoopage is the lowest.|$|E
25|$|The anode and cathode foils must be {{protected}} from direct {{contact with each other}} because such contact, even at relatively low voltages, may lead to a short circuit. In case of direct contact of both foils the oxide layer on the anode surface gives no protection. A spacer or separator made of a special highly absorbent paper with high purity protects the two <b>metal</b> <b>foils</b> from direct contact. This capacitor paper also serves as a reservoir for the electrolyte to extend the lifetime of the capacitor.|$|E
25|$|Film/foil {{capacitors}} or <b>metal</b> <b>foil</b> capacitors use two plastic {{films as}} the dielectric. Each film {{is covered with}} a thin <b>metal</b> <b>foil,</b> mostly aluminium, to form the electrodes. The advantage of this construction is the ease of connecting the <b>metal</b> <b>foil</b> electrodes, along with an excellent current pulse strength.|$|R
25|$|Film/foil {{capacitors}} or <b>metal</b> <b>foil</b> capacitors {{are made}} with two plastic films as the dielectric.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{applying}} a physical barrier to suppress thermal decomposition near a {{surface of a}} thermoelectric material including applying a continuous <b>metal</b> <b>foil</b> to a predetermined portion of {{the surface of the}} thermoelectric material, physically binding the continuous <b>metal</b> <b>foil</b> {{to the surface of the}} thermoelectric material using a binding member, and heating in a predetermined atmosphere the applied and physically bound continuous <b>metal</b> <b>foil</b> and the thermoelectric material to a sufficient temperature in order to promote bonding between the continuous <b>metal</b> <b>foil</b> and the surface of the thermoelectric material. The continuous <b>metal</b> <b>foil</b> forms a physical barrier to enclose a predetermined portion of the surface. Thermal decomposition is suppressed at the surface of the thermoelectric material enclosed by the physical barrier when the thermoelectric element is in operation...|$|R
25|$|Klee {{has been}} {{variously}} associated with Expressionism, Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism, and Abstraction, but his pictures {{are difficult to}} classify. He generally worked in isolation from his peers, and interpreted new art trends in his own way. He was inventive in his methods and technique. Klee worked in many different media—oil paint, watercolor, ink, pastel, etching, and others. He often combined them into one work. He used canvas, burlap, muslin, linen, gauze, cardboard, <b>metal</b> <b>foils,</b> fabric, wallpaper, and newsprint. Klee employed spray paint, knife application, stamping, glazing, and impasto, and mixed media such as oil with watercolor, watercolor with pen and India ink, and oil with tempera.|$|E
25|$|Supercapacitors are {{constructed}} with two <b>metal</b> <b>foils</b> (current collectors), each coated with an electrode material such as activated carbon, which {{serve as the}} power connection between the electrode material and the external terminals of the capacitor. Specifically to the electrode material {{is a very large}} surface area. In this example the activated carbon is electrochemically etched, so that the surface of the material is about a factor 100,000 larger than the smooth surface. The electrodes are kept apart by an ion-permeable membrane (separator) used as an insulator to protect the electrodes against short circuits. This construction is subsequently rolled or folded into a cylindrical or rectangular shape and can be stacked in an aluminum can or an adaptable rectangular housing. Then the cell is impregnated with a liquid or viscous electrolyte of organic or aqueous type. The electrolyte, an ionic conductor, enters the pores of the electrodes and serves as the conductive connection between the electrodes across the separator. Finally the housing is hermetically sealed to ensure stable behavior over the specified lifetime.|$|E
500|$|In his 1924 {{dissertation}} [...] (Research on Quantum Theory), French physicist Louis de Broglie {{hypothesized that}} all matter {{can be represented}} as a de Broglie wave {{in the manner of}} light. That is, under the appropriate conditions, electrons and other matter would show properties of either particles or waves. The corpuscular properties of a particle are demonstrated when it is shown to have a localized position in space along its trajectory at any given moment. The wave-like nature of light is displayed, for example, when a beam of light is passed through parallel slits thereby creating interference patterns. In 1927 George Paget Thomson, discovered the interference effect was produced when a beam of electrons was passed through thin <b>metal</b> <b>foils</b> and by American physicists Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer by the reflection of electrons from a crystal of nickel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>Foil</b> Deep Etching is a {{plastograph}} {{print in}} which aluminium foil {{is used to}} draw the engraved images. The thin foil is cut and placed on an engraved plate and then the embossed sheet is removed, turned over and filled with resin to stabilise the relief. The resin filled foil is then laminated on plywood or no any other surface. Onobrakpeya first started experimenting with foils and from the experiments transformed the foils into a print medium in the 1980s. He used already printed plates to try out the technique. <b>Metal</b> <b>Foil</b> Relief Print is a three-dimensional <b>metal</b> <b>foil</b> print drawn on a plastocast plate. A fairly thick foil is cut and placed over a plate and hand pressed to transfer {{the shape of the}} picture on the plate. The foil is then removed and filled from behind. It is then laminated onto a plywood and coloured {{in the same way as}} the <b>metal</b> <b>foil</b> deep etching print process already discussed above. Note that while the <b>metal</b> <b>foil</b> deep etching print is drawn from plastograph plates, the <b>metal</b> <b>foil</b> relief print is hand embossed on a plastograph plate.|$|R

2500|$|When Geiger and Marsden shot alpha {{particles}} {{at their}} <b>metal</b> <b>foils,</b> they noticed {{only a tiny}} fraction of the alpha particles were deflected by more than 90°. [...] Most just flew straight through the foil. This suggested that those tiny spheres of intense positive charge were separated by vast gulfs of empty space. Most particles passed through the empty space and experienced negligible deviation, while a handful struck the nuclei of the atoms and bounced right back.|$|E
2500|$|The {{applications}} of ultrasonic welding are extensive and {{are found in}} many industries including electrical and computer, automotive and aerospace, medical, and packaging. [...] Whether two items can be ultrasonically welded is determined by their thickness. [...] If they are too thick this process will not join them. [...] This is the main obstacle in the welding of metals. [...] However, wires, microcircuit connections, sheet <b>metal,</b> <b>foils,</b> ribbons and meshes are often joined using ultrasonic welding. [...] Ultrasonic welding is a very popular technique for bonding thermoplastics. [...] It is fast and easily automated with weld times often below one second {{and there is no}} ventilation system required to remove heat or exhaust. [...] This type of welding is often used to build assemblies that are too small, too complex, or too delicate for more common welding techniques.|$|E
2500|$|After the war came another {{period of}} retrenchment. Not only did {{military}} supply contracts end, but luminous dial manufacturing shifted to promethium-147 and tritium. Also, radium mining in Canada ceased in 1954, driving up supply costs. In that year, the company consolidated its operations at facilities in Morristown, New Jersey and South Centre Township east of Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. In Bloomsburg, {{it continued to}} produce items with luminescent paint using radium, strontium-90 and cesium-137 such as watch dials, instrument gauge faces, deck markers, and paint. It ceased radium processing altogether in 1968, spinning off those operations as Nuclear Radiation Development Corporation, LLC, based in Grand Island, New York. The following year, a new facility at the Bloomsburg plant opened for the manufacturing of [...] "tritiated <b>metal</b> <b>foils</b> and tritium activated self-luminous light tubes," [...] and the company switched focus to the manufacture of glow-in-the-dark exit and aircraft signs using tritium.|$|E
