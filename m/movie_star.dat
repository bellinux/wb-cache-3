5|$|The {{characterization}} of Neville Sinclair {{was inspired by}} <b>movie</b> <b>star</b> Errol Flynn, or rather by the image of Flynn that had been popularized by Charles Higham's unauthorized and fabricated biography of the actor, in which he asserted that Flynn was, among other things, a Nazi spy.
