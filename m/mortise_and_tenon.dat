5|$|The {{construction}} of cathedrals and castles advanced building technology, {{leading to the}} development of large stone buildings. Ancillary structures included new town halls, houses, bridges, and tithe barns. Shipbuilding improved {{with the use of the}} rib and plank method rather than the old Roman system of <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenon.</b> Other improvements to ships included the use of lateen sails and the stern-post rudder, both of which increased the speed at which ships could be sailed.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{during the}} Song period reached new heights of sophistication. Authors such as Yu Hao and Shen Kuo wrote books {{outlining}} {{the field of}} architectural layouts, craftsmanship, and structural engineering in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively. Shen Kuo preserved the written dialogues of Yu Hao when describing technical issues such as slanting struts built into pagoda towers for diagonal wind bracing. Shen Kuo also preserved Yu's specified dimensions and units of measurement for various building types. The architect Li Jie (1065–1110), who published the Yingzao Fashi ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') in 1103, greatly expanded upon the works of Yu Hao and compiled the standard building codes used by the central government agencies and by craftsmen throughout the empire. He addressed the standard methods of construction, design, and applications of moats and fortifications, stonework, greater woodwork, lesser woodwork, wood-carving, turning and drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, painting and decoration, brickwork, glazed tile making, and provided proportions for mortar formulas in masonry. In his book, Li provided detailed and vivid illustrations of architectural components and cross-sections of buildings. These illustrations displayed various applications of corbel brackets, cantilever arms, <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenon</b> work of tie beams and cross beams, and diagrams showing the various building types of halls in graded sizes. He also outlined the standard units of measurement and standard dimensional measurements of all building components described and illustrated in his book.|$|E
25|$|Biscuits are {{predominantly}} used in joining sheet goods such as plywood, particle board and medium-density fibreboard. They are sometimes used with solid wood, replacing <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenon</b> joints {{as they are}} easier to make and almost as strong. They are also used to align pieces of wood when joined edge-to-edge in making wider panels. It is important {{to use the same}} face when cutting the slots, so the boards are perfectly flush.|$|E
25|$|Routers {{have many}} uses. With {{the help of}} the {{multitude}} of jigs and various bits, they are capable of producing dovetails, <b>mortises,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenons,</b> moldings of infinite varieties, dados, rabbets/rebates, raised panel doors and frames, cutting circles, and so much more.|$|R
50|$|Many of Wegner's wooden {{chairs are}} {{characterized}} by traditional joinery techniques including <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenons,</b> finger joints, <b>and</b> sculpted elements such as armrests and seat supports. Wegner also utilized traditional construction for upholstered pieces, and often mixed materials such as solid wood, plywood, metal, upholstery, caning, and papercord.|$|R
50|$|Although lumber was {{plentiful}} in 19th-century America, {{skilled labor}} was not. The advent of cheap machine-made nails, along with water-powered sawmills {{in the early}} 19th century made balloon framing highly attractive, {{because it did not}} require highly skilled carpenters, as did the dovetail joints, <b>mortises</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenons</b> required by post-and-beam construction. For the first time, any farmer could build his own buildings without a time-consuming learning curve.|$|R
25|$|Commonly used {{woodworking}} tools included axes, adzes, chisels, pull saws, and bow drills. <b>Mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenon</b> joints are attested {{from the}} earliest Predynastic period. These joints were strengthened using pegs, dowels and leather or cord lashings. Animal glue came to be used only in the New Kingdom period. Ancient Egyptians invented the art of veneering and used varnishes for finishing, though the composition of these varnishes is unknown. Although different native acacias were used, as was the wood from the local sycamore and tamarisk trees, deforestation in the Nile valley resulted in {{the need for the}} importation of wood, notably cedar, but also Aleppo pine, boxwood and oak, starting from the Second Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Shipwreck D {{provided}} {{the team with}} an unprecedented opportunity to document hull construction {{during a time of}} transition. When observing the sonar signature of Shipwreck D, a long, slender upright feature on the seabed, transformed itself into a wooden mast. Elements rarely present on shallower shipwreck sites are beautifully preserved 200 m below the surface. Disappointingly for ship scholars and historians of technology, there are few indications of how the planks of Sinop D are held together. There are no <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenon</b> fastenings, and no sewing. Shipwreck D {{may be one of the}} earliest lateen-rigged ships to be studied by archaeologists. The angle of the mast and the lack of fittings on it suggest that a lateen sail is the most likely configuration for such a small vessel.|$|E
25|$|The first {{dedicated}} war galleys {{fitted with}} rams were built with a <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenon</b> technique, a so-called shell-first method. In this, the planking {{of the hull}} {{was strong enough to}} hold the ship together structurally, and was also watertight without the need for caulking. Hulls had sharp bottoms without keelsons in order to support the structure and were reinforced by transverse framing secured with dowels with nails driven through them. To prevent the hull from hogging there was a hypozoma, a thick cable that connected bow with stern. It was kept taut to add strength to the construction along its length, but its exact design or the method of tightening is not known. The ram, the primary weapon of ancient galleys from around the 8th to the 4th century, was not attached directly on the hull but to a structure extending from it. This way the ram could twist off if got stuck after ramming rather than breaking the integrity of the hull. The ram fitting consisted of a massive, projecting timber and the ram itself was a thick bronze casting with horizontal blades that could weigh from 400kg up to 2 tonnes.|$|E
50|$|Roseville Plantation is a {{historic}} home located near Florence, Florence County, South Carolina. It was built about 1885 and renovated about 1910. It is a two-story, lateral gabled, weatherboard-clad residence. The building consists partly of <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenoned</b> hand-hewn <b>and</b> peeled log construction. It {{was built on the}} foundations of the original plantation house built about 1835. It features a broad, one-story, hip roofed wraparound veranda.|$|R
50|$|CNC router (Or Computer Numerical Control router) is a {{computer-controlled}} {{cutting machine}} {{related to the}} hand held router used for cutting various hard materials, such as wood, composites, aluminium, steel, plastics, and foams. CNC stands for computer numerical control. CNC routers can perform the tasks of many carpentry shop machines such as the panel saw, the spindle moulder, and the boring machine. They can also cut <b>mortises</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenons.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{house at}} New Farm covered about 30 squares, {{including}} a 6' wide verandah all round. It had four main rooms (which could be subdivided to make eight) and three tokonomas and chigai-tanas. There was an akari shoji (moon window) made by exposing the bamboo frame of a plaster {{wall in the}} suki-ya tradition. The shelves of the chigai-tana were meticulously veneered to avoid exposing end grain. The corner posts and beams of the tokonomas had been chosen from cherrywood, hokki pine or bamboo samples. There were few hand wrought iron nails in the house {{as most of the}} joints were <b>mortised</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenoned</b> <b>and</b> secured with wooden pegs.|$|R
25|$|Local {{fishermen}} {{had always}} {{been aware of the}} existence of the wrecks, and had explored them and removed small artifacts, often using grappling hooks to pull up pieces, which they sold to tourists. In 1446, Cardinal Prospero Colonna and Leon Battista Alberti followed up on the stories regarding the remains and discovered them lying at a depth of , which at that time was too deep for effective salvage. They caused significant damage to the ships by using ropes with hooks to tear planks from them. Alberti learned little more than the type of wood and that it was covered in lead sheathing. In 1535, Francesco De Marchi dove on the wreck using a diving bell. His finds included bricks, marble paving stones, bronze, copper, lead artefacts and a great number of timber beams. He had all of the wood made into items such as walking sticks and boxes. De Marchi apparently sold everything he collected to the nobility and foreign visitors who visited the site to watch his work. From material recovered he added the knowledge that <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenon</b> joints had been used in their construction. Despite the successful salvage of entire structures and parts, there was no academic interest in the ships, so no further research was performed. The objects recovered were lost and their fate remains unknown.|$|E
500|$|The {{ship was}} {{constructed}} around a [...] long keel of [...] thickness, which {{is believed to}} have survived intact. The front of the ship had a 61° angle of rake at the bow where the stem post was joined to the keel with <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenon</b> joints and secured with [...] diameter rope. The hull planks were stitched onto the frames and keel through holes spaced at [...] intervals. The boat had a keelson for added strength, which rested on the half-frames.|$|E
500|$|Early Egyptians {{also knew}} how to {{assemble}} planks of wood with treenails to fasten them together, using pitch for caulking the seams. The [...] "Khufu ship", a [...] vessel sealed into a pit in the Giza pyramid complex {{at the foot of}} the Great Pyramid of Giza in the Fourth Dynasty around 2500BC, is a full-size surviving example that may have filled the symbolic function of a solar barque. Early Egyptians also {{knew how to}} fasten the planks of this ship together with <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenon</b> joints.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Chair", 1949. The Chair best {{represents}} Wegner's design {{philosophy of}} [...] "continuous purification...to cut {{down to the}} simplest possible elements of four legs, a seat, and a combined top rail and armrest" [...] The Chair was a collaboration of Wegner and furniture maker Johannes Hansen (now made by PP Mobler as models PP501/PP503). The construction features 11 pieces of wood joined by 12 <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenons</b> <b>and</b> two large finger joints. The finger joints orient the wood grain as the back rail wraps around the body to maximize material strength. The Chair was offered with a solid upholstered seat, or a seat of airy woven caning. It rose to prominence in the 1961 televised debate between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy. Both presidential candidates sat in The Chair during the debate.|$|R
50|$|Construction began {{soon after}} Putnam arrived in 1788 using a {{building}} method known as post-and-plank or corner post construction. Each {{wall of the}} building was built prefabricated. Four-inch-thick by foot-wide hewn oak timbers were <b>mortised</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenoned,</b> <b>and</b> fastened with wooden dowels into a diagonal braced frame. Random-width four-inch-thick planks were fitted to complete the wall lying on the ground. Each plank was numbered with Roman numerals, then removed so the frame could be raised, and then re-assembled. Eight by eight-inch oak floor joists with neither foundation nor basement were used, and tulip poplar floor boards were laid, but not fastened until seasoned.|$|R
5000|$|Inside the barns are {{supported}} by heavy structural systems. The <b>mortised</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenoned</b> <b>and</b> pegged beams are arranged in [...] "H-shaped" [...] units. The design alludes to cathedral interiors with columned aisles along a central interior space, used in Dutch barns for threshing. It is this design that links Dutch barns to the Old World barns of Europe. Another distinctive feature of the Dutch barn is that {{the ends of the}} cross beams protrude through the columns. These protrusions are often rounded to form tongues. This feature is not found in any other style of barn design.|$|R
500|$|The stones, {{as smooth}} as {{polished}} marble, were laid without mortar with very tight joints that are sometimes hard to find. The blocks were held together by <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenon</b> joints in some cases, while in others they used dovetails and gravity. The blocks were presumably put in place {{by a combination of}} elephants, coir ropes, pulleys and bamboo scaffolding. Henri Mouhot noted that most of the blocks had holes [...] in diameter and [...] deep, with more holes on the larger blocks. Some scholars have suggested that these were used to join them together with iron rods, but others claim they were used to hold temporary pegs to help manoeuvre them into place.|$|E
500|$|The {{framing of}} the house is unusual because it has [...] "longitudinal summer beams {{extending}} from the end girts to the chimney girts in both the hall and the parlor. Corner and intermediate posts are flared in gunstock pattern. The walls are sheathed with vertical planking except in the attic gables, where the planks are laid horizontally, alternating the taper. Framing is cased in the parlor and exposed in the hall, where the summers are adzed and roughly chamfered." [...] The attic construction is conventional with equally spaced rafters that have <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenon</b> joints at the ridge. This type of construction indicates that the conventional principal rafter or purlin framing may not have been used in Ledyard during that time.|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} the Borodino-class ships was {{modified}} as a consequence, which slowed their construction. Deck armour was reinforced with extra plates, the turret roofs were increased to a thickness of , and the side and roof of the conning tower were increased by [...] and [...] respectively. To compensate for the additional weight, the rear conning tower was removed entirely and {{the thickness of the}} main belt was reduced by [...] <b>Mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenon</b> joints were introduced between the armour plates along their vertical edges to better distribute the shock of a shell impact and to lessen the stress on the supporting hull structure. The launching of the first pair of ships was postponed by six months because of these changes, plus delays imposed by the large number of ship orders already in hand.|$|E
50|$|The Perkins House {{stands on}} the south side of Perkins Street, between the street and the Bagaduce River. It faces west, toward the main Wilson Museum building. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a central chimney. A 1-1/2 story ell extends to the rear of house; it also has a gable roof and a chimney. Its timbers are hand-hewn <b>and</b> joined by <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenons,</b> the lath used in the walls is made of split wood. The front entry is framed by {{sidelight}} windows and pilasters, and topped by an entablature and gabled pediment.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were many}} forms of {{fastening}} in use before threaded fasteners became widespread. They tended to involve carpentry and smithing rather than machining, and they involved concepts such as dowels <b>and</b> pins, wedging, <b>mortises</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenons,</b> dovetails, nailing (with or without clenching the nail ends), forge welding, and many kinds of binding with cord made of leather or fiber, using many kinds of knots. Prior to the mid-19th century, cotter pins or pin bolts, and [...] "clinch bolts" [...] (now called rivets), were used in shipbuilding. Glues also existed, although not in the profusion seen today.|$|R
50|$|Two {{kinds of}} villa-plan in Roman Britain may be {{characteristic}} of Roman villas in general. The more usual plan extended wings of rooms all opening onto a linking portico, {{which might be}} extended at right angles, even to enclose a courtyard. The other kind featured an aisled central hall like a basilica, suggesting the villa owner's magisterial role. The villa buildings were often independent structures linked by their enclosed courtyards. Timber-framed construction, carefully fitted with <b>mortises</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenons</b> <b>and</b> dowelled together, set on stone footings, were the rule, replaced by stone buildings for the important ceremonial rooms. Traces of window glass have been found, as well as ironwork window grilles.|$|R
500|$|The present {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Watkin George. George had been trained as a carpenter, but in 1792 became the chief engineer of the ironworks and {{a partner in the}} business. The bridge is composed of two cast iron A-frame trusses supporting a rectangular 2-foot by 6-foot-2-inch cast iron trough. This lower trough carried the Taff Fechan leat and acts as a girder supporting the plates acting as the railway sleepers, into which the rail chairs are integrally cast. [...] Wooden uprights were attached to the iron risers that passed through the apex of each of the A-frames and these supported the upper trough carrying the Taff Fawr leat. Reflecting its designer's roots in carpentry, the members composing the trusses are joined by dovetail and <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenon</b> joints commonly used in wooden structures.|$|E
500|$|Several of the church's pews {{date from}} 1857 {{and remain in}} use. The pews, quite simple in form, have a [...] "minimalist appearance". Each pew {{consists}} of a long wooden plank {{that serves as the}} seat, with a thin rail supported by three spindles as the backrest. The pews are supported by three arched supports joined to the seat by a <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenon</b> joint and reinforced with nails. The newer pews exhibit identical design elements but are constructed with modern nails and timber. Though most of the pews are arranged against the church's west elevation with a center aisle, two are along the north elevation and four are along the south elevation. The pulpit is situated at the east elevation. There is an upright piano in the northeastern corner of the church.|$|E
500|$|The {{panel is}} made from six {{horizontal}} boards linked by butt joins reinforced with a cylindrical rod, with the joins glued with plant fibres. The reverse is not painted, indicating {{it was intended to}} hang against a wall. The frame comprises a main frame nailed and screwed at the side to two outer parts. The borders do not show signs of having hinges, indicating that the work was meant as a stand-alone panel, and not as part of a triptych. The corners are assembled with <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenon.</b> Each corner is reinforced by two pegs. The boards were originally painted a uniform brown, and were degraded by gloss and overprint over the centuries. Following a series of restorations, mainly by Jef Van der Veken in 1933-34 and Edmond Florens in 1977, they are in good condition. The inscriptions were placed on flat strips between the mouldings.|$|E
50|$|Laminate {{trimmers}} {{have evolved}} {{to the point where}} they are essentially fully functional miniature routers. Apart from trimming and flushing, they can be used for jointing, rounding edges, chamfering, routing grooves and dados, dovetails, even <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenons.</b> A modern laminate trimmer can perform almost any task that a larger handheld router can do, with the caveat that the smaller machine may be limited in the size of bit that can physically fit within its collet and the base plate. Larger bits, e.g. those that fit a 1/2-inch collet or those with larger blade diameters than the laminate trimmer's smaller baseplate hole, cannot be used at all. The reduced power of a laminate trimmer (3/4 to 1 hp, as opposed to a typical router's 1-3 hp) may also make it unsuitable for heavy-duty router work.|$|R
50|$|In 1789-1790, Marmaduke built a {{substantial}} house which apparently {{was designed as}} an inn, trading post and stage coach stop on the road from Washington to Wrightsboro. It had two stories and consisted of two large rooms 20 × 20 feet, one over the other. The inside chimney was flanked on one side by a cupboard {{and on the other}} by a narrow winding staircase. This staircase was peculiar in that at a height of eight feet it made a complete semicircle. Another circular staircase directly above this led into the loft. The roof sloped down directly over the staircase so that one had to crawl in order to enter the loft. The open beams were all hand-hewn, and all joints were <b>mortised</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenoned</b> <b>and</b> secured with wooden pegs. Both rooms were paneled with wide boards of virgin pine, dark brown and mellowed with the passing years. The house is still standing and occupied. It is owned by Ian Mcfie. Before Ian McFie, the home and 540 of the original 600 acre were owned by his father Girdwood Mcfie. Girdwood maintained the farm animals in exactly the same numbers as listed in the inventory of Marmaduke's estate in 1797.|$|R

500|$|Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya {{was built}} by the ONZiV Shipyard at Nikolayev. She was laid down on 30 October 1911 as Ekaterina II, but {{this was just a}} {{ceremonial}} event as the design had not yet been finalized or the contract signed. ONZiV decided, on advice from Vickers, to increase her dimensions over those of her sisters to prevent her from being overweight. This added over two million gold rubles to her cost and delayed the start of her construction three months past her sisters. She suffered from a number of other delays during construction. First the method of fastening the armor to its supports was changed and the armor plates were locked together by a type of <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenon</b> joint to better distribute the shock of an impact. This was based on the full-scale armor trials conducted using the hulk of the old pre-dreadnought battleship [...] in 1913 and added almost [...] of weight to the ship. She was launched on 6 June 1914, renamed on 27 June 1915, and completed on 18 October 1915. She ran her trials during the remainder of the year.|$|E
500|$|Imperator Aleksandr III {{was built}} by the Russud Shipyard at Nikolayev.

This added almost [...] of weight to the ship and raised her cost by 220,000 rubles. Then her priority was reduced after the start of World War I to concentrate efforts on her more advanced sister ships to complete them more quickly. She was not expected to be finished before 1916, but her British-built turbines were also delayed. Imperator Aleksandr III was launched on 15 April 1914, but did not arrive at Sevastopol for fitting out until 17 July 1917, by which time the ship had been renamed Volia (Freedom). She conducted her sea trials over the next several months. By this time the Black Sea Fleet was totally ineffective {{as a result of the}} political situation after the February Revolution and Volia did not see any combat.|$|E
500|$|The {{full-scale}} armor trials {{with the}} hulk {{of the old}} pre-dreadnought battleship [...] greatly affected the armor protection of the Imperatritsa Mariya-class ships. The Krupp cemented armor plates were sized to match the frames to provide support for their joints and they were locked together by a type of <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenon</b> joint to better distribute the shock of a shell's impact.

60|$|The {{form of this}} {{monument}} is {{not only}} described but delineated in most authors, and, indeed, {{it is hard to}} know the first but by the last. The figure was at first circular, and there were at least four rows or circles within one another.

50|$|A bench joiner {{will need}} to be aware of the correct {{procedure}} for assembly of this type of door. Firstly he will glue and wedge the rails to the meeting stiles and then join the two meeting stiles together with the folding wedges, the through top rail and the metal bar recessed into the bottom of the door. Then the panels are slid into their places from the outsides. Of course he will follow good practice when inserting the panels, he will ensure that there is no glue in the groove that will stick the panels to the groove thus allowing the panels to move independently of the rails and stiles so they will not split as the door shrinks or expands. If the door is to be polished he will ensure that the panels are pre-polished with at least one coat to ensure that no bare wood is shown if the panels shrink. Once the panels are inserted the bench joiner will assemble the outer stiles, cramp and ensure the door is square before wedging up the <b>mortise</b> <b>and</b> <b>tenons</b> of the outer stiles.|$|R
