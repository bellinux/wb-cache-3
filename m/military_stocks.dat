2500|$|For the {{increasing}} ranks of recruits, infantry training {{was carried out}} at a CIA-run base (code-named JMTrax) near Retalhuleu in the Sierra Madre on the Pacific coast of Guatemala. The exiled group named themselves Brigade 2506 (Brigada Asalto 2506). In summer 1960, an airfield (code-named JMadd, aka Rayo Base) was constructed near Retalhuleu, Guatemala. Gunnery and flight training of Brigade 2506 aircrews {{was carried out by}} personnel from Alabama ANG (Air National Guard) under General Reid Doster, using at least six Douglas B-26 Invaders in the markings of Fuerza Aérea Guatemalteca, legitimate delivery of those being delayed by about six months. An additional 26 B-26s were obtained from US <b>military</b> <b>stocks,</b> 'sanitized' at 'Field Three' to obscure their origins, and about 20 of them were converted for offensive operations by removal of defensive armament, standardization of the 'eight-gun nose', addition of underwing drop tanks and rocket racks. Paratroop training was at a base nicknamed Garrapatenango, near Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. Training for boat handling and amphibious landings took place at Vieques Island, Puerto Rico. Tank training took place at Fort Knox, Kentucky, and Fort Benning, Georgia. Underwater demolition and infiltration training took place at Belle Chase near New Orleans. To create a navy, the CIA purchased five cargo ships from the Cuban-owned, but Miami-based Garcia Line, thereby giving [...] "plausible deniability" [...] as the State Department had insisted no US ships could be involved in the invasion. The first four of the five ships, namely the Atlantico, the Caribe, the Houston and Rió Escondido were to carry enough supplies and weapons to last thirty days while the Lake Charles had 15 days of supplies and was intended to land the provisional government of Cuba. The ships were loaded with supplies at New Orleans and sailed to Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. Additionally, the invasion force had two old Landing Craft Infantry (LCI) ships, the Blagar and Barbara J from World War II that were part of the CIA's [...] "ghost ship" [...] fleet and served as command ships for the invasion. The crews of the supply ships were Cuban while the crews of the LCIs were Americans, borrowed by the CIA from the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) One CIA officer wrote that MSTS sailors were all professional and experienced, but not trained for combat.|$|E

By 1982, Iran's major military supplier was North Korea, with sales in that year of $800 million.

Some came from North Korean <b>military</b> <b>stocks</b> and were replaced by the originating country, while others were merely transshipped, still in the original factory crate.

On-ground humanitarian aid was provided by the 353rd Civil Affairs Command, Bronx, New York City, and by subordinate units 432nd Civil Affairs Battalion, Green Bay, Wisconsin, and 431st Civil Affairs BN, Little Rock, Arkansas. These units were relocated to Turkey and Northern Iraq after completing missions in Kuwait. They were soon joined by Lieutenant Colonel Ted Sahlin's 96th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne) from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, which had only returned to the U.S. two weeks before after having been deployed to Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait for the past 10 months. The base camps that were established for Kurdish refugees were nicknamed Camp Jayhawk and Camp Badger after college mascots. Other camps were established in Silopi, Turkey the first troops to arrive were the 36h CES from Bitburg Air Base Germany, the 36th CES which built all base camp and facilities for multi-national troops sent to assist with the operation. Smaller [...] "detachment" [...] camps were also built in and around Zakho, Iraq and Sirsenk, Iraq by these same members and were led by USAF Prime BEEF commander Captain Donald Gleason from Ramstein Air Force base and USAF Prime RIBS personnel from RAF Bentwaters.

Supplies for these camps were sourced from a variety of areas including units that were returning to the U.S., Coalition countries, European <b>military</b> <b>stocks,</b> and civilian contractors in the U.S. Many supplies had to be airdropped due to restrictions by the Turkish government for entering Iraq through their border.|$|E

40|$|During 2009 {{nuclear power}} plants, with a {{capacity}} of 370 GWe, will produce roughly 14 % of the worldwide electric energy. About 65000 tons of natural uranium equivalent are required to operate these reactors. For 15 years on average only 2 / 3 of this fuel {{is provided by the}} uranium mines and 1 / 3 comes from secondary resources. According to the International Atomic Energy Administration (IAEA) and the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the secondary uranium resources will be essentially exhausted during the next 5 - 10 years. In this paper the situation concerning the secondary resources {{at the beginning of the}} year 2009 is presented. The data used are from the IAEA/NEA 2007 Red Book, “Uranium Resources, Production and Demand”, and from the World Nuclear Association (WNA). Our analysis shows that at the beginning of 2009 the remaining worldwide civilian uranium stocks amount to roughly 50000 tons. With the almost unavoidable yearly drawdown of 10000 tons, these civilian stocks will be essentially exhausted within the next 5 years. This coincides roughly with the year 2013, when the delivery of the 10000 tons of natural uranium equivalent from russian <b>military</b> <b>stocks</b> to the USA will end. As the majority of the remaining civilian stocks, about 30000 tons, are believed to be under the control of the US government and american companies, it seems rather unlikely that the USA will share their own strategic uranium reserves with other large nuclear energy users. In summary, all data indicate that a uranium supply shortage in many OECD countries can only be avoided if the remaining military uranium stocks from Russia and the USA, estimated to be roughly 500000 tons are made available to the other countries...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} {{criminal}} gangs and organized crime groups has created unprecedented challenges in Central America. Homicide rates {{are among the}} highest in the world, countries spend on average close to 10 percent of GDP to respond to the challenges of public insecurity, and the security forces are frequently overwhelmed and at times coopted by the criminal groups they are increasingly tasked to counter. With some 90 percent of the 700 metric tons of cocaine trafficked from South America to the United States passing through Central America, the lure of aiding illegal traffickers through provision of arms, intelligence, or simply withholding or delaying the use of force is enormous. These conditions raise the question: to what extent are militaries in Central America compromised by illicit ties to criminal groups? The study focuses on three cases: Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras. It finds that: Although illicit ties between the military and criminal groups have grown in the last decade, militaries in these countries are not yet “lost’ to criminal groups. Supplying criminal groups with light arms from <b>military</b> <b>stocks</b> is typical and on the rise, but still not common. In general the less exposed services, the navies and air forces, are the most reliable and effective ones in their roles in interdiction. Of the three countries in the study, the Honduran military is the most worrying because it is embedded in a context where civilian corruption is extremely common, state institutions are notoriously weak, and the political system remains polarized and lacks the popular legitimacy and political will needed to make necessary reforms. Overall, the armed forces in the three countries remain less compromised than civilian peers, particularly the police. However, in the worsening crime and insecurity context, there is a limited window of opportunity in which to introduce measures targeted toward the military, and such efforts can only succeed if opportunities for corruption in other sectors of the state, in particular in law enforcement and the justice system, are also addressed. Measures targeted toward the military should include: Enhanced material benefits and professional education opportunities that open doors for soldiers in promising legitimate careers once they leave military service. A clear system of rewards and punishments specifically designed to deter collusion with criminal groups. More effective securing of military arsenals. Skills and external oversight leveraged through combined operations, to build cooperation among those sectors of the military that have successful and clean records in countering criminal groups, and to expose weaker forces to effective best practices...|$|E
