2500|$|There {{have been}} several {{epidemiological}} studies that say there is {{an increased risk of}} various diseases, especially cancers, among people who live near nuclear facilities. A widely cited 2007 meta-analysis by Baker et al. of 17 research papers was published in the European Journal of Cancer Care. It offered evidence of elevated leukemia rates among children living near 136 nuclear facilities in the United Kingdom, Canada, France, United States, Germany, Japan, and Spain. However this study has been criticized on several grounds – such as combining heterogeneous data (different age groups, sites that were not nuclear power plants, different zone definitions), arbitrary selection of 17 out of 37 individual studies, exclusion of sites with zero observed cases or deaths, etc. Elevated leukemia rates among children were also found in a 2008 German study by Kaatsch et al. that examined residents living near 16 <b>major</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plants in Germany. This study has also been criticised on several grounds. These 2007 and 2008 results are not consistent with many other studies that have tended not to show such associations. The British Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment issued a study in 2011 of children under five living near 13 nuclear power plants in the UK during the period 1969–2004. [...] The committee found that children living near power plants in Britain are no more likely to develop leukemia than those living elsewhere Similarly, a 1991 study for the National Cancer Institute found no excess cancer mortalities in 107 US counties close to nuclear power plants. However, in view of the ongoing controversy, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has requested the National Academy of Sciences to oversee a state-of-the-art study of cancer risk in populations near NRC-licensed facilities.|$|E

25|$|The {{bilateral}} {{interaction was}} possible because, in many respects, Brazil and Argentina {{shared a common}} understanding of the global non-proliferation regime as a top-down imposition of the <b>major</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers</b> {{at the expense of}} weaker nations. In fact, starting in the early 1960s the two delegations to the IAEA had a tacit agreement, through which they would take turns in the seat assigned to the Latin American country with the most advanced nuclear program.|$|R
50|$|Responding to Smiling Buddha, the Nuclear Suppliers Group {{severely}} {{affected the}} India's nuclear program. The world's <b>major</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers</b> imposed technological embargo on India and Pakistan, which was technologically racing {{to meet with}} India's challenge. The nuclear program struggled for years to gain credibility and its progress crippled {{by the lack of}} indigenous resources and dependent on imported technology and technical assistance. At IAEA, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared that India's nuclear program was not militarising despite authorising preliminary work on the hydrogen bomb design.|$|R

40|$|This article investigates {{forms of}} social, political, and {{economic}} organization conducive to <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> expansion. We begin {{by developing a}} theoretical framework of nuclear socio-political economy based primarily upon the evolution of nuclear energy in France. This framework posits that (1) strong state involvement in guiding economic development, (2) centralization of national energy planning, (3) campaigns to link technological progress to a national revitalization, (4) influence of technocratic ideology on policy decisions, (5) subordination of challenges to political authority, and (6) low levels of civic activism are influential factors in supporting development of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power.</b> Accordingly, we seek to verify the causal properties of these six catalysts for <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> expansion in two nations – India and China – {{that are on the}} brink of becoming <b>major</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers.</b> We validate our framework by confirming the presence of the six catalysts during the initial <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> developmental periods in each country. We also apply our framework as a predictive tool by considering how present conditions in the two nations will impact <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> development trends. We conclude by highlighting the emergence of a potential seventh catalyst – the influence of greenhouse gas emission abatement policy on <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> development...|$|R
40|$|Major {{news media}} and think tanks have written and {{broadcast}} repeatedly about efforts to prevent nuclear war in South Asia, but relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to containment should a conflict between India and Pakistan break out. Even a limited nuclear exchange in South Asia would kill millions and have adverse environmental effects far beyond the region. Because India and Pakistan have ties to theworldÕs <b>major</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers,</b> such an exchange also has the potential to expand into worldwide nuclear war. A US-led effort to engage themajor <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers</b> in bilateral ormultilateral no-first-use pledgeswould decrease the likelihood that a conflict between India and Pakistan could spin out of control. Beyond South Asia, a no-first-use policy would help the United States implement its nonproliferation agenda, promote stability between nuclear weapons states, and deemphasize the role of nuclear weapons in defense policy, saving the United States money and increasing world security...|$|R

50|$|Nevertheless, energy {{conservation}} alone would not suffice. Since the 1970s, economic planners had been pursuing an ambitious nuclear energy program. In the long run, in their judgment, nuclear power was absolutely {{vital to the}} projected energy balance. In late 1978, the first <b>major</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plant (of Soviet design) began operation at Jaslovské Bohunice. In 1985 and 1986, portions of the Dukovany station began test runs, and preliminary site work was underway for two more power stations, at Mochovce in western Slovakia and Temelín in southern Bohemia. Nuclear power's share of the total electricity supply increased to almost 20% in 1986. According to the long-range plan, with expansion of this power station plus construction of additional stations and the import of electricity from joint nuclear projects in the Soviet Union, nuclear power would provide 30% or more of total electricity by 1990. Plans called for nuclear power to account for over 53% of electricity by the year 2000. Although the 1986 Chernobyl accident in the Soviet Union did not alter the government's commitment to nuclear power, particularly since none of the existing or planned reactors used the kind of technology employed at Chernobyl, Czechoslovak leaders acknowledged {{the need for a}} thorough review of safety measures. Subsequently a number of special conferences were held concerning nuclear power issues. Czechoslovakia was well positioned to fuel its ambitious nuclear program; in the mid-1980s, the country was an important producer of uranium. The uranium reserves were located in the Krušné hory of Bohemia.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the fall}} of Singapore in World War II, Australia and New Zealand both came to the {{realisation}} that Britain could no longer protect her former colonies in the Pacific. Accordingly, both countries desired an alliance with the United States and in 1951 the ANZUS Treaty was signed between the three countries. This meant that if a Treaty partner came under attack, the other two {{would be required to}} come to its aid. Although none of the ANZUS partners came under attack, (until, arguably, September 11, 2001, or the Rainbow Warrior bombing), both Australia and New Zealand nonetheless felt obliged to help America in its Cold War conflicts in Korea and Vietnam. Because of its close proximity to Asia, Australia has always been more worried than New Zealand about an invasion from Asia, and has thus been a more enthusiastic partner with America. New Zealand's contribution to the Vietnam War was small, whereas Australia went as far as to introduce conscription. By the 1970s, many people in both countries had begun to oppose the American alliance, not least because of Vietnam. America's role as a <b>major</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> was also a strong factor in anti-American sentiment. In 1984 New Zealand enacted a ban on nuclear armed or powered ships in its waters, essentially preventing most American naval ships from visiting New Zealand. As a result, America suspended its treaty obligations to New Zealand under the ANZUS alliance. Despite this, New Zealand committed small numbers of soldiers to the 1991 Gulf and Afghanistan Wars, and has sent engineering units to Iraq. Australia has remained a strong supporter of America, despite major domestic opposition; it was the third largest member (by number of troops) in the 'coalition of the willing' in Iraq.|$|E

50|$|South Korea is {{not allowed}} to enrich uranium or develop {{traditional}} uranium enrichment technology on its own, because of US political pressure, unlike most <b>major</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers</b> such as Japan, Germany, and France, competitors of South Korea in the international nuclear market. This impediment to South Korea's indigenous nuclear industrial undertaking has sparked occasional diplomatic rows between the two allies. While South Korea is successful in exporting its electricity-generating nuclear technology and nuclear reactors, it cannot capitalize on the market for nuclear enrichment facilities and refineries, preventing it from further expanding its export niche. South Korea has sought unique technologies such as pyroprocessing to circumvent these obstacles and seek a more advantageous competition. The US has recently been wary of South Korea's burgeoning nuclear program, which South Korea insists will be for civilian use only.|$|R
