This changeover to <b>monetary</b> <b>targeting</b> was due to the difficulties which the Bundesbank - like other central banks - was facing in pursuing its original strategy, and whichcame to a head in the early seventies, when inflation escalated. A second factor was the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates, which created the necessary scope for national <b>monetary</b> <b>targeting.</b> Finally, the advance of monetarist ideas fostered the explicit turn towards <b>monetary</b> <b>targets,</b> although the Bundesbank did not implement these in a mechanistic way. Whereas the Bundesbank has adhered to its policy of <b>monetary</b> <b>targeting</b> up to the present, nowadays <b>monetary</b> <b>targeting</b> plays only a minor role worldwide.

Exploiting the time dimension of our data to eliminate country fixed effects and using instrumental variable estimation to overcome endogeneity concerns, we present evidence that greater CBI is associated with lower inflation.
