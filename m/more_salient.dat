5|$|Ottawa distinguishes {{two types}} of {{grammatical}} third person in sentences, marked on both verbs and animate nouns. The proximate form indicates a <b>more</b> <b>salient</b> noun phrase, and obviative indicates a less prominent noun phrase. Selection and use of proximate or obviative forms is a distinctive aspect of Ottawa syntax that indicates the relative discourse prominence of noun phrases containing third persons; {{it does not have}} a direct analogue in English grammar.|$|E
5|$|Of Stratton's many contributions, {{his studies}} on {{perception}} and visual illusions {{would continue to}} influence the field of psychology well after his death. Of the nine books he wrote, {{the first was a}} scholarly look at the methodology and scope of experimental psychology. The remaining, including one unfinished at his death, were on sociology, international relations and the issues of war and how findings from psychology could be used to eradicate conflict between nations. Stratton considered these issues <b>more</b> <b>salient</b> to the application of psychology in the real world, though his ideas on this front did not produce a lasting impact in the field because of their subjective and non-experimental nature.|$|E
5|$|One {{proposed}} {{explanation for}} the existence of count-classifiers is that they serve more of a cognitive purpose than a practical one: in other words, they provide a linguistic way for speakers to organize or categorize real objects. An alternative account is that they serve more of a discursive and pragmatic function (a communicative function when people interact) rather than an abstract function within the mind. Specifically, it has been proposed that count-classifiers might be used to mark new or unfamiliar objects within a discourse, to introduce major characters or items in a story or conversation, or to foreground important information and objects by making them bigger and <b>more</b> <b>salient.</b> In this way, count-classifiers might not serve an abstract grammatical or cognitive function, but may help in communication by making important information more noticeable and drawing attention to it.|$|E

5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are <b>more</b> <b>salient</b> than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E

25|$|Foreign affairs seldom became {{partisan}} issues (except for {{the annexation}} of Hawaii, which Republicans favored and Democrats opposed). Much <b>more</b> <b>salient</b> were cultural issues. The GOP supported the pietistic Protestants (especially the Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians and Scandinavian Lutherans) who demanded prohibition. That angered wet Republicans, especially German Americans, who broke ranks in 1890–1892, handing {{power to the}} Democrats.|$|E

50|$|Bear Rocks is {{a remarkably}} scenic, windswept summit atop one of West Virginia's highest mountains. It is {{perched on a}} ridge of {{sandstone}} cliffs and is a rock outcropping on the Allegheny Front with a 2,000 to 3,000-foot (600 to 1,000 m) drop below that forms the Eastern Continental Divide. To the east, {{looking out over the}} South Branch of the Potomac River, which drains into the Atlantic Ocean via the Chesapeake Bay, there are breathtaking 35 mi views where seven mountain ridges are visible on a clear day extending into Virginia. On the clearest days you can see Hawksbill Mountain and Stony Man, the highest peaks in Shenandoah National Park. To the west, water drains into Dolly Sods towards Red Creek, which eventually flows to the Gulf of Mexico via the Dry Fork River, Black Fork, Cheat, Mongahela, Ohio and Mississippi River. Farther north along the ridge of the Front are two <b>more</b> <b>salients,</b> Stack Rocks and Haystack Rocks.|$|R
40|$|Humans have {{an ability}} to rapidly detect emotive stimuli. However, many {{emotional}} objects in a scene are also highly visually salient, {{which raises the question}} of how dependent the effects of emotionality are on visual saliency and whether the presence of an emotional object changes the power of a <b>more</b> visually <b>salient</b> object in attracting attention. Participants were shown a set of positive, negative, and neutral pictures and completed recall and recognition memory tests. Eye movement data revealed that visual saliency does influence eye movements, but the effect is reliably reduced when an emotional object is present. Pictures containing negative objects were recognized more accurately and recalled in greater detail, and participants fixated more on negative objects than positive or neutral ones. Initial fixations {{were more likely to be}} on emotional objects than <b>more</b> visually <b>salient</b> neutral ones, suggesting that the processing of emotional features occurs at a very early stage of perception...|$|R
25|$|Syllable {{deletion}} – stressed syllables are emphasis {{that may}} be given to certain syllables in a word. They {{are more likely to}} be retained in children's pronunciation than unstressed syllables (less emphasis on the sound) because they are <b>more</b> <b>salient</b> to children in an early language acquisition process. So children may say helikat instead of helicopter or fowe instead of telephone. That way, they don't pronounce the more emphasized sound in the word.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} alcohol myopia’s effects on one’s {{decisions}} about how to react to sexual arousal is dependent upon the level of confliction one feels. The more intense the personal conflict {{of whether or not}} to use a condom, the greater effect alcohol has on the final decision to engage in risky sexual behavior. Intoxicated males who had felt heavily conflicted about condom use were least likely to use a condom. Those intoxicated men who had been less conflicted about using a condom were {{more likely to engage in}} safe sex. Therefore, some intoxicated individuals can actually be less likely to engage in risky sexual behavior than their sober counterparts, given appropriate cues. The effects of alcohol myopia on response to sexual arousal also depend on the level of sexual arousal. When sexual arousal levels were high, a greater percentage of men reported not using a condom than when arousal levels were low. This goes back to the importance of saliency in alcohol myopia. The <b>more</b> <b>salient</b> the external cue (in this case, higher levels of sexual arousal were <b>more</b> <b>salient</b> than lower levels) the more likely it is for alcohol to inhibit the comprehension of the consequences of an action.|$|E
25|$|In {{multiple}} studies, neuroticism {{has been}} shown to have an equal, if not larger, impact on happiness and subjective well-being than extraversion. One study classified school children into four categories based on their scores in assessments of extraversion and emotional stability (neuroticism). The results showed {{no significant difference between the}} happiness levels of stable introverts and stable extraverts, while unstable extraverts and introverts both demonstrated significantly less happiness than their counterparts. In this study, neuroticism appeared to be the <b>more</b> <b>salient</b> factor for overall well-being.|$|E

40|$|Speech {{perception}} {{relies on}} auditory, visual, and motor cues {{and has been}} historically difficult to model, partially due to this multimodality. One of the current models is the Fuzzy Logic Model of Perception (FLMP), which suggests that if one {{of these types of}} speech mode is altered, the perception of that speech signal should be altered in a quantifiable and predictable way. The current study uses social priming to activate the schema of blindness in order to reduce reliance of visual cues of syllables with a visually identical pair. According to the FLMP, by lowering reliance on visual cues, visual confusion should also be reduced, allowing the visually confusable syllables to be identified more quickly. Although no main effect of priming was discovered, some individual syllables showed the expected facilitation while others showed inhibition. These results suggest that there is an effect of social priming on speech perception, despite the opposing reactions between syllables. Further research should use a similar kind of social priming to determine which syllables have <b>more</b> acoustically <b>salient</b> features and which have <b>more</b> visually <b>salient</b> features...|$|R
25|$|Workplace {{bullying}} overlaps to {{some degree}} with workplace incivility but tends to encompass more intense and typically repeated acts of disregard and rudeness. Negative spirals of increasing incivility between organizational members can result in bullying, but isolated acts of incivility are not conceptually bullying despite the apparent similarity in their form and content. In case of bullying, the intent of harm is less ambiguous, an unequal balance of power (both formal and informal) is <b>more</b> <b>salient,</b> and the target of bullying feels threatened, vulnerable and unable to defend himself or herself against negative recurring actions.|$|E
25|$|With {{regards to}} {{cultural}} {{differences in how}} the genders view infidelity, {{it was observed that}} females found emotional infidelity much more distressful and males found sexual infidelity to be much more distressful than females. A comparison between modern day Chinese and American societies showed that there was greater distress with sexual infidelity in the US than in China. The cultural difference is most likely due to the more restrictive nature of Chinese society, thus, making infidelity a <b>more</b> <b>salient</b> concern. Sexual promiscuity is more prominent in the United States, thus it follows that American society is more preoccupied with infidelity than Chinese society (Geary et al. 1995).|$|E
25|$|Alcohol myopia {{has also}} been found to affect one’s level of {{commitment}} to a personal goal. Individual commitment to a goal is dependent upon level of personal desire and feasibility of the goal. A person’s ability to appropriately interpret feasibility is inhibited by alcohol myopia. This is because desire is a <b>more</b> <b>salient</b> stimulus than feasibility, causing those experiencing alcohol myopia to ignore the less salient stimulant of feasibility. Because one is less inhibited {{by the prospect of}} unfeasible goals, those under the influences of alcohol myopia tend to feel more committed to their goals than sober individuals. Studies testing the relationship between intoxication and level of commitment to goals support the theory that increased goal commitment (despite level of feasibility) is a side effect of alcohol myopia.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{strategy}} for improvement amongst individuals with poor memory functioning {{is the use}} of elaboration to improve encoding of items, one form of this strategy is called self-imagining whereby the patient imagines the event to be recalled from a more personal perspective. [...] Self-imagining has been found to improve recognition memory by coding the event {{in a manner that is}} <b>more</b> individually <b>salient</b> to the subject.

40|$|Studies of derived {{relational}} responding and stimulus equivalence that {{examine the}} acquisition of arbitrary stimuli into existing classes suggest that classes that are <b>more</b> emotionally <b>salient</b> facilitate {{the acquisition of}} novel members. This study examined the hypothesis that personal distress would create facilitated acquisition in deriving relations between two arbitrary stimuli and one personally distressing stimulus. Transformation of function was also measured via self-report. No facilitated acquisition effect appeared, but transformation of function was more pronounced in the distressed group. These findings suggest that transformation of function is possible before the relations are fully derived and facilitated acquisition only occurs in particular behavioral contexts...|$|R
