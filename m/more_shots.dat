5|$|At 33 seconds a neon monster, {{with the}} 'SFA' logo on his chest, appears amongst the {{translucent}} buildings. <b>More</b> <b>shots</b> {{of the band}} and the computer generated city follow before the monster reappears during the second chorus, this time with electric bolts shooting from his body. As the track reaches its middle 8 a multicoloured neon spacecraft appears.|$|E
5|$|Bonventre {{was called}} to a meeting with Rastelli in Queens. He {{was picked up by}} Vitale and Attanasio and driven to a garage. En route, Attanasio shot Bonventre twice in the head but only wounded him; he would kill Bonventre with two <b>more</b> <b>shots</b> when they reached their destination. The task of {{disposing}} of Bonventre's corpse was handed to Gabriel Infanti, who promised Vitale that Bonventre's remains would disappear forever. However, after a tipoff, the remains were discovered on April 16, 1984, in a warehouse in Garfield, New Jersey, stuffed into two 55-gallon glue drums.|$|E
5|$|<b>More</b> <b>shots</b> of the band, {{cityscape}} and 'SFA' monster follow {{until the}} final verse, when the view returns to {{the road from the}} beginning of the video. The camera then flies up inside a skyscraper made entirely of small images of a mouth singing the along with the track. As the song finishes the view again returns to the road. Small spaceships (similar to the one from the middle 8) gather at either side as the city is left behind and the road gradually disappears.|$|E

5|$|No player {{along the}} lane may enter the key until the shot is released; the player {{shooting}} the free throw, and anyone {{on top of}} the key, should not pass the free throw line until the ball hits the rim. If any of the offensive players violate the rule, no points are awarded for the shot and, if there are no <b>more</b> <b>shots</b> remaining, the ball is given to the defending team. If a defending player is in the lane too soon, an extra shot will be awarded regardless of whether the shot was made or missed.|$|E
5|$|When {{the show}} began using computers, the {{cardboard}} cutouts were scanned and re-drawn with CorelDRAW, then imported into PowerAnimator, {{which was used}} with SGI workstations to animate the characters. The workstations were linked to a 54-processor render farm that could render 10 to 15 shots an hour. Beginning with season five, the animators began using Maya instead of PowerAnimator. The studio now runs a 120-processor render farm that can produce 30 or <b>more</b> <b>shots</b> an hour.|$|E
5|$|While his {{men were}} {{clearing}} up the remaining German positions, Ingram scouted ahead in search of machine gun nests in the village. He soon located one positioned in a house, which had been firing through the cellar ventilator. Managing to enter the house, he shot the gunner through the ventilator. He fired several <b>more</b> <b>shots</b> into the cellar before rushing {{to the head of}} the cellar stairs. By thus cutting off any means of escape, a further thirty Germans were taken prisoner.|$|E

5|$|Wormull helped Stevenage {{to reach}} {{the final of the}} FA Trophy in 2002, which they lost 2–0 to {{full-time}} professional club Yeovil Town. While with the club he won his seventh international cap, and maintained his reputation as a good crosser of the ball who was willing to shoot; in his first two seasons with the club he contributed <b>more</b> <b>shots</b> than any of his teammates, and in his second and third seasons he made most assists. Stevenage began to move towards full-time status before the 2002–03 season. At the end of that season, Wormull submitted a transfer request, because he was struggling to balance work and football commitments. Manager Graham Westley rejected the request, but in April 2004 his contract was cancelled by mutual consent, citing the player's injury record and his difficulties adjusting to the demands of full-time football.|$|E
5|$|During the 2009–10 season, Rolle started 33 games, in 24 {{of which}} he scored in double figures and in 11 {{of which he}} had double-doubles. He {{rejected}} <b>more</b> <b>shots</b> {{than anyone else in the}} WAC, averaging 2.1 blocks per game, and finished fourth in career blocked shots at Louisiana Tech despite playing there for only two seasons. Rolle also posted averages of 8.4 rebounds per game, third in the WAC (behind Luke Babbitt of Nevada and Chis Oakes of San Jose State), and 13.9 points per game, 12th in the WAC. His field goal percentage was 51.1, tied with Babbitt for third in conference and behind Tai Wesley of Utah State and Ike Okoye of Boise State. At the conclusion of the season, Rolle was named to the Lefty Driesell All-America Defensive Team, All-WAC Defensive Team, All-WAC Second Team, and All-Louisiana Second Team. He graduated from Louisiana Tech with a bachelor's degree in sociology in March 2010, becoming the first person in his family to earn a degree.|$|E
5|$|Francisco Rafael was celebrating his 64th {{birthday}} {{along with}} his wife, children, and friends at Ocean House, a beachfront banquet hall owned by Hotel Marbella in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur on 18 October 2013. There were about 80 to 100 attendees at the party, including prominent businessmen, politicians, celebrities, and sport figures like former Mexican footballer Jared Borgetti and boxing champion Omar Chávez. The party also hosted a number of musical groups, including banda La Cabeña, El Mariachi de Los Cabos, and the former leading vocalist of Banda El Recodo. At around 8:00p.m. that day, a black-colored SUV entered the private property and parked near {{the entrance of the}} ballroom. In the front seats of the car, according to eye-witness reports, were two men; in the back seat was a man dressed as a clown, who descended from the vehicle and headed towards the door that led to the kitchen. Once inside the ballroom, the clown identified Francisco Rafael {{at the center of the}} room and began to walk towards him. When the clown was about 1m (3.3ft) close, he pulled out a pistol from his costume and shot him point-blank in his head and then several times more as he fell to the ground, killing him on the scene. As the former drug lord lay dead near the entrance, the assassin ran through a rear exit while the attendees yelled, fell to the ground, and hid under the tables. Four <b>more</b> <b>shots</b> were heard outside the ballroom shortly after the attack; according to eyewitnesses, the clown had done this to scare off one of Francisco Rafael's sons, who was chasing him. The suspect then fled the crime scene in the black-colored SUV and headed towards the highway.|$|E

5|$|Once Jardine left Oxford, {{he began}} to qualify as a {{solicitor}} while still playing for Surrey. He made steady progress {{over the next three}} seasons but was overshadowed by other amateur batsmen. His contemporaries at Oxford and Cambridge attracted more attention in the press, as did the next generation of amateur batsmen. He was appointed vice-captain to Fender for the 1924 season. Several professionals, such as Jack Hobbs, could have been made captain, but Jardine was preferred as an amateur. In that season, Jardine was selected for the Gentlemen v Players match {{for the first time and}} came third in the Surrey averages. In all first-class matches, he scored 1,249 runs at an average of 40.29. In the following season, Jardine was less successful, scoring fewer runs at a lower average and with a highest score of 87 (1,020 runs at 30.90). Suggestions made in the press that Jardine should captain the Gentlemen with a view towards the future of the England Test team, were ignored. In the event, owing to an injury sustained playing village cricket, he was unable to appear in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. In 1926, Jardine had his most successful season to date, with 1,473 runs (average 46.03), although he was again overshadowed by other players and by the attention given to the Ashes series being played. Towards the end of the season, his batting became more attractive and his rate of scoring increased as {{he began to}} play <b>more</b> <b>shots.</b> His assurance and judgement against all bowling, even international bowlers, increased and he scored 538 runs in his final ten innings.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} people he shot were sitting {{directly}} in front of him. The shooting was contained to one theater. After the shooting ended, Houser exited the theater through a side door and apparently tried to head for his vehicle while blending in with survivors. However, upon noticing police sirens, he retreated back inside the building and fired three <b>more</b> <b>shots</b> at fleeing moviegoers before committing suicide.|$|E
25|$|A {{few minutes}} later, Auvinen spotted the first {{responding}} {{police officers and}} paramedics converging at {{the area of the}} inner court. He fired a shot at them through a window, but the bullet failed to penetrate the glass. At 12:04, he took another position near the main entrance and fired two <b>more</b> <b>shots</b> at police officers who tried to approach and negotiate with him. No officers were hit. Soon afterward, Auvinen walked into the corridor next to the canteen and shot himself in the head, ending the shooting.|$|E
25|$|Greif then fired one <b>more</b> <b>shot,</b> and Alcantara duly {{returned}} fire. The {{one shot}} was later {{attributed to a}} shell left in the breech of an abandoned gun being fired by {{the heat of the}} fire now raging aboard Greif.|$|R

25|$|This time, {{the ships}} {{that he was}} facing were in motion, {{and he had to}} contend with three monitors, not one. Tennessee was so slow that she became the target of ramming rather than her opponents. Several of the Federal sloops managed to ram, {{including}} Monongahela, which had been fitted with an iron shield on her bow just for this purpose. None of the collisions harmed the ironclad; in every case, the ramming vessel suffered <b>more.</b> <b>Shots</b> from Farragut's fleet bounced off Tennessees armor, but Tennessees fire was ineffective due to inferior powder and multiple misfires.|$|E
25|$|Allen Crum, a 40-year-old retired Air Force tail gunner, was {{a manager}} at the University Book Store Co-Op. Across the street he saw a 17-year-old {{newspaper}} boy being dragged and went to break up {{what he thought was}} a fight. Learning the boy had been shot, and hearing <b>more</b> <b>shots,</b> Crum rerouted street traffic out of harm's way. Unable to make his way back to the store safely, he then made his way to the tower, where he offered to help the police. Inside the tower, he accompanied Department of Public Safety Agent Dub Cowan and Austin Police Officer Jerry Day up the elevator; Cowan provided Crum with a rifle.|$|E
25|$|While {{still in}} the parking lot, Mătăsăreanu was shot twice in the right buttock and the left forearm, forcing him to abandon his duffel bag of money, enter the {{get-away}} vehicle, and start the engine. Phillips retrieved the HK-91 from the open trunk and continued firing upon officers, while walking alongside the sedan, using it for cover. As Phillips approached the passenger's side of the get-away vehicle, he {{was hit in the}} shoulder and his rifle was struck in the receiver and magazine by bullets fired by police. After firing a few <b>more</b> <b>shots</b> with one arm, Phillips discarded the HK-91, and retrieved the Norinco Type 56 before exiting the parking lot and retreating onto the street while Mătăsăreanu drove down the road.|$|E

25|$|Bosse {{entered the}} school building, firing several <b>more</b> <b>shots</b> and {{wounding}} four students. He also lit several smoke bombs, filling the building up with smoke. At 9:34 a.m., police arrived, but found {{entry into the}} school extremely difficult. At 9:58 a.m., a special task force finally breached the school and searched the building, discovering the body of Bosse {{on the second floor}} at 10:36 a.m., 38 minutes after entry. Bosse had shot himself in the mouth, although it was initially unclear if he had shot himself or was killed by the detonation of an explosive device that was attached to his body. Explosive experts had to be brought in to defuse the explosives found strapped to his body, as well as additional explosives found around the school.|$|E
25|$|Video of the {{shooting}} shows that Van Dyke was advancing on McDonald, while McDonald was walking away from Van Dyke when the first shot was fired. The first shot hit McDonald, who spun {{and fell to the}} ground. As McDonald lay on the ground, still holding the knife, Van Dyke fired <b>more</b> <b>shots</b> into him. In total, Van Dyke shot McDonald 16 times in 14–15 seconds, expending the maximum capacity of his 9mm semi-automatic firearm. Van Dyke was on the scene for less than 30 seconds before opening fire and began shooting approximately six seconds after exiting his car. The first responding officer said that he did not see the need to use force, and none of the at least eight other officers on the scene fired their weapons.|$|E
25|$|Weaving {{normally}} begins {{from the}} bottom of the loom, by passing a number of wefts through the warps to form a base to start from. Knots of dyed wool, cotton or silk threads are then tied in rows around consecutive sets of adjacent warps. As more rows are tied to the foundation, these knots become the pile of the rug. Between each row of knots, one or <b>more</b> <b>shots</b> of weft are passed to keep the knots fixed. The wefts are then beaten down by a comb-like instrument, the comb beater, to further compact and secure the newly-woven row. Depending on the fineness of the weave, the quality of the materials and the expertise of the weavers, the knot count of a handmade rug can vary anywhere from 16 to 800 knots per square inch.|$|E
