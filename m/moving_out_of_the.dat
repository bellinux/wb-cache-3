5|$|The Maryland–Virginia {{football}} rivalry was {{a designated}} official ACC cross-divisional series when Maryland was an ACC member and the teams have a long-standing rivalry due to proximity and history. The programs also vie for recruits {{in the same}} region, and more recently, an additional factor has been the schools' academic competition. Maryland and Virginia have occasionally served as spoilers for one another by precluding a championship or bowl game appearance. Since Maryland is <b>moving</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ACC and into the Big Ten, {{the future of this}} series is in question. On January 12th, 2017, the schools jointly announced a home-home series would be played during the 2023 and 2024 seasons.|$|E
5|$|Dr. John Markway narrates {{the history}} of the 90-year-old Hill House, which was {{constructed}} by Hugh Crain as a home for his wife. She died when her carriage crashed against a tree as she approached the house for the first time. Crain remarried, but his second wife died in the house from a fall down the stairs. Crain's daughter Abigail lived in the house {{for the rest of her}} life, never <b>moving</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nursery. She died calling for her nurse-companion. The companion inherited the house, but later hanged herself from a spiral staircase in the library. Hill House was eventually inherited by a Mrs. Sanderson, although it has stood empty for some time.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, {{incumbent}} Pryce {{announced her}} retirement {{at the end}} of her elected term. The Democrats felt that the seat continued to be vulnerable. Kilroy announced her intention to again seek the 15th District seat in 2008. She ran against Republican Steve Stivers, a State Senator from the 16th District, Libertarian Mark M. Noble, and Independent candidate Don Elijah Eckhart. The race was considered to be one of the most important U.S. House of Representatives races to watch in the country. The last Democrat to hold the 15th district was Robert T. Secrest in the mid-1960s, but with Republican voters <b>moving</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> district into the northern suburbs of Columbus, Ohio since the 1990s, the district became more evenly matched.|$|E

5|$|On 7 May 1915, the IV Scouting Group, {{which by}} then {{consisted}} of Stettin, Stuttgart, , and Danzig, and twenty-one torpedo boats was sent into the Baltic Sea {{to support a}} major operation against Russian positions at Libau. The operation was commanded by Rear Admiral Hopman, {{the commander of the}} reconnaissance forces in the Baltic. The IV Scouting Group was tasked with screening to the north to prevent any Russian naval forces from <b>moving</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Finland undetected, while several armored cruisers and other warships bombarded the port. The Russians did attempt to intervene with a force of four cruisers: Admiral Makarov, Bayan, Oleg, and Bogatyr. The Russian ships briefly engaged München, but both sides were unsure of the others' strength, and so both disengaged. Shortly after the bombardment, Libau was captured by the advancing German army, and Stettin {{and the rest of the}} IV Scouting Group were recalled to the High Seas Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Liberty Property Trust {{hoped to}} get the One Pennsylvania Plaza site {{designated}} a Keystone Opportunity Improvement Zone (KOZ). KOZ designation was intended to encourage development in poor, blighted areas by exempting the tenants of the building from all state and local taxes. Designating One Pennsylvania Plaza a KOZ was supported by then Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, who said {{it was important to}} keep corporations within the city. At the time, many of Philadelphia's big employers' leases, including Comcast's, were due to expire, and the employers were considering the possibility of <b>moving</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city and state. Rendell also said allowing Comcast to enlarge its headquarters by moving into One Pennsylvania Plaza could attract other corporate headquarters to the city. However, other Center City building owners, including Comcast's landlord at Centre Square, HRPT Properties Trust, were opposed to the plan. They said giving the tower the KOZ designation would give it an unfair advantage because Liberty Property Trust could charge above-market rents since the tax breaks would offset the cost for tenants. The group believed tenants attracted to One Pennsylvania Plaza because of the tax breaks would cause more vacancies in other Center City skyscrapers, rather than attracting more business to blighted areas as intended under the law. In early 2004, Center City had a vacancy rate of 12.8%.|$|E
5|$|The ride {{begins with}} Evac <b>moving</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loading station {{and making a}} turn. The vehicle {{approaches}} the first of thirteen 3D high-definition video screens which depicts Ravage grabbing a canister containing the AllSpark. Evac spins 180° to face the second screen on which Bumblebee is fighting Sideways for the AllSpark, which ends up in Evac's possession. Evac reverses into one of two elevator shafts which ascend to the second level of the attraction. During the ascent Optimus Prime battles Megatron and Grindor chases Evac who is furiously heading in reverse until Grindor's arm is broken off by a train. Megatron grabs Evac and the two struggle until Megatron breaks a water pipe, which sprays riders with water. Evac enters a dead end pathway before reversing and turning to face another 3D screen, which shows Megatron firing a missile at Evac while continuing to find Optimus. Hot air and fog generate the illusion of an explosion. Evac then heads {{through the hole in}} a building which was caused by the explosion. Inside lies Devastator, who is trying to suck everything out of the building. Ratchet and Ironhide cover fire while Evac reverses and escapes the suction. Here the Autobot Sideswipe helps in the battle against the Decepticon Bonecrusher. Devastator returns to the scene alongside Starscream. Evac escapes from Devastator a second time by going through him, but Starscream grabs Evac and throws him across several city blocks before landing on a construction site and smashing into some drums which release clouds of fog resulting in Evac asking if the riders are okay. Optimus Prime and Megatron continue their battle in the construction site as Evac reverses away in an attempt to protect the AllSpark. Starscream appears for a second time but is chased away by two NEST helicopters. Evac then returns to a second set of two elevators. During the descent to the ground floor, Evac forces the AllSpark into Megatron's chest causing both to freefall to the ground when Megatron grabs Evac. Bumblebee saves Evac from destruction before Optimus Prime congratulates Evac and the riders on their mission. The last thing guests see before disembarking is the twisted wreckage of Megatron stuck in the ceiling near the exit.|$|E

5|$|The storm's {{convection}} {{organized around}} a central core, {{and the system}} became a tropical storm on November23 and received the name Delta. An eye-like feature appeared near the storm's circulatory center several times that day. The larger-scale deep-layered cyclonic circulation within which it was embedded steered it on a slow southward and then south-southwesterly track. Strong wind shear prevented immediate development and the system added an eastward component to its drift. <b>Moving</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high-shear environment on November24, Delta gained organization. Outflow and convective banding increased and an eye feature became well defined. This eye signaled the storm's peak strength of 70mph (110km/h), just below hurricane status. However, the official forecast at the time predicted Delta to strengthen further and become a minimal hurricane. Delta's motion stalled as it reached the southern base of a large cyclonic trough over the northern Atlantic within which it was embedded. Maintaining its intensity, Delta remained motionless for half a day until, that evening when it began a slow southward drift at 6mph (9km/h). Maintaining its intensity, Delta remained motionless for half a day Convection broke down in the storm's western semicircle early on November25; the decreased organization caused slight weakening. Maintaining its intensity, Delta remained motionless for half a day The southward motion slowed and the weakening trend continued into the evening. Cooling cold tops were counteracted by wind shear which exposed most of the low-level center. The storm's southward motion stopped and it began moving east at 6mph (9km/h). Some of the computer models suggested the weakening tropical storm could be absorbed by a developing low to the west, which {{a few days later}} became Hurricane Epsilon. This did not occur, and Tropical Storm Delta began to move to the northeast.|$|E
