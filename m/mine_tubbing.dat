5000|$|The {{colliery}} railway probably used <b>mine</b> <b>tubs</b> {{from the}} collieries' internal lines {{when it opened}} in 1876. By 1902, 18 flat four-wheeled wagons were in use, each of which carried four mine [...] "hutches". The hutches were small <b>mine</b> <b>tubs</b> each of which carried 9½ cwt (480 kg) of coal. The hutches were mounted transversely on short lengths of rail on the main railway wagons.|$|R

50|$|According to Mr K.B.C. Montgomery, {{the owner}} and last manager of the hone stone mine, interviewed at the site on 16 October 2010, the extant <b>mine</b> <b>tubs</b> in Dalmore Quarry were brought there {{a few years ago}} by the BBC for a {{television}} documentary about coal-mining during the nineteenth century. The wagons used in the hone stone mine were smaller and of a different type. For the documentary the broken waste stone dumped over the sides of the quarry was sprayed with black paint so that it looked like a huge stack of coal in the film. At the date of the interview there was a length of the stone mine track in situ beneath the grass leading from close to the mine shaft {{to the edge of the}} quarry, still present in 2010.|$|R
5000|$|The mines on the Denniston Plateau {{included}} the Banbury, Ironbridge, Coalbrookdale, Whareatea, and Sullivan mines. The first mine was the Banbury, which began production in 1880. A double track 2 ft (0.61m) gauge 560 metre long horse tramway was built {{from the top}} of the incline to the Banbury Mine above the Waimangaroa Gorge to carry coal from the mine to the top of the incline. Later, horse-power was replaced by a steam engine-powered moving endless rope to which <b>mine</b> <b>tubs</b> were hooked by chains for their journeys to and from the bins at Brakehead. By 1889, the double track tramway (now called a roperoad) had been extended through and beyond the Banbury Mine, past the Ironbrook Mine and on to the Coalbrookdale Mine—a distance of about 2.4 kilometres (1.5 miles). The roperoad system was renewed along a partly new alignment between 1900 and 1904. (An image of one of these roperoads can be seen below in External links.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{primary school}} was opened in August 1895 by Sir Charles Palmer, the MP for Jarrow (who had {{at one time}} been {{the manager of the}} colliery, {{becoming}} a partner in 1842), and finally closed over a century later {{at the beginning of the}} 2010 Christmas Holidays. At the time of writing the school buildings remain in situ. They are still owned by Gateshead Council and there have been calls to ensure that they are retained for public use. The Sacred Heart R.C. school in the neighbouring village of Byermoor was also under threat of closure, with the intention that the pupils would join those from Marley Hill at other schools in the area, mainly Clover Hill and Washingwell primaries in Whickham, although this decision was subsequently reversed. Prior to closure, two wooden-bodied <b>mine</b> <b>tubs</b> from the colliery stood outside the front of the school for many years. These had gradually fallen into a state of disrepair, and were subsequently removed for restoration. This having been completed, they were unveiled during a small ceremony on 6 October 2011 by Gateshead's Mayor, Councillor Joe Mitchison, in a new position on the grassed area in front of the aged miner's cottages, with the area's three Liberal Democrat councillors (who had secured the funding to have them restored) in attendance. The event was recorded by Councillor Jonathan Wallace, and the footage uploaded to YouTube. The sound quality on the video is affected as a result of the prevailing westerly winds which frequently buffet the village due to its exposed location.|$|R
40|$|Mining is the {{extraction}} of valuable minerals from earth. Mining creates pollution which affects the surrounding environment. Loss of many biological species and deterioration of soil quality were the ultimate consequences. During mining, companies should adopt mitigation measures for maintaining good environmental conditions. EIA (Environment Impact Assessment) is required to understand {{the status of the}} environment that will help in taking up appropriate strategy to combat any adverse effect on it. Soil status {{is one of the key}} factors in the EIA. Land rehabilitation and mine reclamation are very crucial after finishing of mining. For this purpose the present study was conducted on physico-chemical characteristics and microbial diversity of top soil from selected villages (Nawari, Tubed and Dhobiajharan) in the proposed coal <b>mining</b> area of <b>Tubed</b> Coal <b>Mines</b> Ltd., Latehar district, Jharkhand, India. The results showed that the pH of the soil was found to be slightly acidic in nature. The bulk density and the specific gravity of the soil samples were very low, that indicates that the soil samples contain higher organic matter which is suitable for the growth of plants. The Chloride content ranged between 8. 62 – 12. 69 mg/g which is far higher than normal range (0. 3 - 1 mg/g). Potassium content is extremely high in all the soil samples which ranged between 566 - 597 Kg/ha except the soil samples from Dhobiajharan village which is found to be very low 63 Kg/ha (normal range is 198. 5 - 254. 1 Kg/ha). 5 bacterial species (Bacillus species, Micrococcus species, Pseudomonas species, Staphylococcus species and Enterobacter species) and one fungal species (Aspergillus sp.) were identified from the soil samples. From the result it is concluded that the soils is rich in macronutrients which is essential for the growth of plants. Hence the suitability of the soil should be maintained after completion of mining in the proposed area. ...|$|R
5000|$|Marley Hill Colliery and the {{adjoining}} coke works were {{situated in the}} area known as Old Marley Hill, further along St. Cuthbert's Road (which is closed to vehicles beyond a large metal gate just past St. Cuthbert's Park), and at one time most of the village, including houses, a shop, the original post office and two Chapels (Wesleyan and Primitive Methodist, the latter being situated {{at the end of}} one of the rows of colliery houses, reputedly earning it the nickname [...] "Ranter's Row") was centred around the colliery itself. There was also a row of very basic houses which was originally called Fen House Row, after a large house which stood in the field behind them, but came to be known simply as [...] "The Hole" [...] or [...] "The Valley." [...] Heading towards the pit, these were on the right hand side of St. Cuthbert's road, just beyond the gate. The houses backed onto the steep hillside along the pit road, and some of them were flattened by a landslide around the turn of the 20th century. The rest were demolished in 1920. There were also three terraces nearer the A6076 which runs from Sunniside to Stanley; Bowes Terrace, Gibraltar Row, and Marley Hill Terrace. These were known collectively as Andrews Houses. Bowes terrace is visible on the 1938 OS map, but appears to have been demolished by 1951. Gibraltar Row and Marley Hill terrace last appear on the 1966 map but some of the houses were certainly still extant as late as 1973, albeit in a derelict condition, as they appear in the background of a photograph taken that year. Bowes Bridge MPD (a sub-shed of Gateshead MPD) on the North Eastern Railway's Tanfield Branch was also in this area, and the disused Turntable pit and coaling stage for the locomotives are still extant alongside the Tanfield Railway, whose car park now occupies the site of Gibraltar Row and Marley Hill Terrace. Bowes Terrace occupied the high ground on the opposite side of the Tanfield Branch, overlooking Marley Hill engine shed, (reputed to be the world's oldest working example) which is still in use by the Tanfield Railway for the storage and maintenance of its locomotives. A number of additional buildings have been constructed around the shed in the years since the site became a heritage railway, including sheds for the storage of out-of use locomotives and rolling stock, a shed for the restored carriages used on the passenger services, as well as a number of workshops. The <b>mine</b> <b>tubs</b> from outside the school were restored in the railway's woodwork shop. Marley Hill shed was actually on the Bowes Railway, which crossed the Tanfield Branch on the level beside the signal box and was owned by the National Coal Board after nationalisation in 1947, whereas the Tanfield branch (by this time part of the LNER) came under the control of British Railways. There are bus stops either side of the road here, which would have originally been used by the occupants of Andrews Houses. These are now used mainly by visitors to the Tanfield Railway, and are served by West Durham Swift services X30 and X31 from Lanchester. The majority of the houses in this area were very basic, and were in an extremely poor condition by the time they were demolished. Some were of a similar design to the houses in the pit village at the nearby Beamish Museum, and others were built as back-to-backs, a type common in Yorkshire (large numbers remain in Leeds), Lancashire and the Midlands but rarely seen in the north-east. The Bowes Railway ran through a cutting east of the signal box, and the Stanley road crossed it on a bridge. After the closure of the line, this bridge was no longer necessary, and the cutting was backfilled, although the western end of it is still visible adjacent to the box, forming the headshunt of the shed yard. There was also another colliery in this area; Andrews House Colliery, which was served by a spur from the Bowes Railway, part of which is still in existence. This is the section of track which crosses the entrance to the shed yard and passes behind the shed, beneath the former coal drops, and continues a short distance to the rear of the site.Coal was also mined from Blackburn Fell Drift, on the other side of the Stanley road, which was served by the Bowes Railway. It had a relatively short life compared to the deep mine, being driven in 1937 and closing in 1979, with the men transferring to Marley Hill. In contrast to those of its neighbours, the surface buildings of this mine (including stables for the pit ponies) survived in a derelict condition for over twenty years, and the partially blocked entrance to the drift itself, (with tub lines emerging from it) was still visible beneath one of them right up until they were finally removed in the early 21st century. Although the main surface structures are gone, a small hut made from the yellow bricks characteristic of many local colliery buildings stands on the hill overlooking the site of the drift, on the opposite side of Birklands Lane. Its windows and door have been bricked up, and a small chimney-like structure which appears to be some kind of vent projects from the roof at one end. Looking from the point where the drift emerged, (and assuming the drift ran in a relatively straight line) this structure appears to sit directly above the main roadway. It is therefore a possibility that it housed pumps or an emergency access shaft, or both. This structure does not appear on the 1921 OS map, but is visible on the map from 1951 (the area is not covered on the 1938-39 map), so it is probably safe to assume that it is in some way associated with the drift. The trackbed of the Bowes Railway on this side of the Stanley road is now a cycle path, and continues from the site of the drift's screens, past Birkheads Cottages and {{the adjoining}} Birkheads Secret Gardens and on to Kibblesworth, where the next colliery on the line was situated.|$|R
