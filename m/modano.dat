5|$|Despite {{growing up}} in Michigan, he was a Minnesota North Stars fan. As a young hockey player, Kesler looked up to North Stars center and fellow Livonia native Mike <b>Modano</b> as a role model. He has also listed Joe Sakic of the Quebec Nordiques and Colorado Avalanche as a {{favorite}} player during his childhood.|$|E
5|$|Free {{of injury}} {{for the first}} time in two seasons, Bure was one of the Panthers' {{offensive}} leaders in 2003–04. He reached 20 goals for the fifth time in his NHL career, and as the season's trade deadline approached, was Florida's leading scorer with 45 points. However, as the Panthers were out of playoff contention, they traded Bure to the Dallas Stars on March 9, 2004, in exchange for Drew Bagnall and a draft pick. Bure was placed on the Stars' top line with Mike <b>Modano</b> and Jere Lehtinen, and he recorded 7 points in 13 games to conclude the regular season. Bure added three assists in five playoff games.|$|E
5|$|The Montreal Canadiens {{have had}} the most first overall picks of any other team, {{selecting}} five players first between 1963 and 1980. Five players {{have come from the}} London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League, more than any other team. 11 players have won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL's rookie of the year: Gilbert Perreault, Denis Potvin, Bobby Smith, Dale Hawerchuk, Mario Lemieux, Bryan Berard, Alexander Ovechkin, Patrick Kane, Nathan MacKinnon, Aaron Ekblad and Auston Matthews.

5|$|After {{one season}} {{playing with the}} Medicine Hat Midget Tigers of the Alberta Midget Hockey League (AMHL), Linden joined the WHL Tigers for the final five games of the 1985–86 regular season, where he scored two goals; he also {{appeared}} in six playoff games, scoring one goal. The next season, {{at the age of}} 16, he made the team full-time. In his first full season in the WHL, Linden had 36 points in 72 games, and then had nine points in 20 playoff games, including two goals in the championship game, helping Medicine Hat win their first Memorial Cup as Canadian junior champions. The next year, Linden had 110 points in 67 games, and led the Tigers to their second consecutive Memorial Cup title. During the 1988 WHL playoffs, Linden set a WHL playoff record by scoring the fastest goal from the start of a game, scoring seven seconds into a 6–5 Tigers win over the Saskatoon Blades on April 15, 1988. At the 1988 NHL Entry Draft, the Vancouver Canucks selected Linden second overall, after the Minnesota North Stars selected Mike <b>Modano.</b>|$|E
25|$|On September 29, 2006, Brenden Morrow was {{announced}} as new team captain, taking the role over from Mike <b>Modano,</b> {{who had served}} as the incumbent since 2003. Jere Lehtinen remained the last Minnesota North Star still with the franchise, although he never wore a Minnesota North Stars jersey; he was drafted by the club {{while it was still}} in Minnesota. On March 13, 2007, Mike <b>Modano</b> scored his 500th career NHL goal, making him only the 39th player and second American to ever reach the milestone. On March 17, <b>Modano</b> scored his 502nd and 503rd NHL goals, breaking the record for an American-born player, previously held by Joe Mullen.|$|E
25|$|To {{begin the}} 2010 season, the Stars won their first three games, {{going on a}} three-game win streak {{for the first time}} since the 2007–08 season by beating the New Jersey Devils in overtime, New York Islanders in a shootout and against Mike <b>Modano</b> and the Red Wings. During the third game against the Red Wings, the Stars crowd gave <b>Modano</b> a {{standing}} ovation as he was shown on the Jumbotron.|$|E
25|$|McFarlane has {{produced}} some noticeable flaws {{throughout the years}} making sports picks. Ones that would stand out the most would be NHL 3’s Mike <b>Modano’s</b> incorrect sock pattern, NHL 5’s Marian Hossa mix up and the dreaded facial likeness of NHL 6’s Vincent Lecavalier. Though some figures that were made wrong in their prototype stage, some have been corrected like the NHL 7 Bertuzzi but some {{made it out of}} the factory before they were fixed.|$|R
50|$|After the 2004 NHL lockout, Jon {{helped the}} Stars {{return to the}} playoffs for the 2005-06 season, before losing at the hands of former team, the Avalanche, in the Western Conference Quarterfinals. In the 2006-07 season, Klemm was re-signed by the Stars on a club option on June 28, 2006. Klemm spent the {{majority}} of the season as a healthy reserve, however his final assist helped him reach a milestone 100 assists for his career. His assist coincidentally came on Mike <b>Modano's</b> milestone 500th goal in a 3-2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on March 13, 2007.|$|R
25|$|The Stars {{played their}} first game in Dallas on October 5, 1993, a 6–4 win against the Detroit Red Wings. In that game, Neal Broten scored the first Stars goal in Dallas. Dallas was an {{experiment}} for the NHL. At that time, the Stars {{would be one}} of the three southern-most teams in the NHL, along with the newly created Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida Panthers as the NHL's first real ventures into southern non-traditional hockey markets. Though the Stars were relatively still unknown, word of the team spread rapidly, and the immediate success of the team on the ice, as well as Mike <b>Modano's</b> career best season (50 goals, 93 points) helped spur the team's popularity in Dallas. The Stars set franchise bests in wins (42) and points (97) in their first season in Texas, qualifying for the 1994 playoffs. The Stars further shocked the hockey world by sweeping the St. Louis Blues in the first round, but lost to the eventual Western Conference Champion Vancouver Canucks in the second round. The Stars' success in their first season, along with American superstar Mike <b>Modano's</b> spectacular on ice performances would be an integral part of the Stars' eventual franchise success in the immediate years to come. The almost immediate success of the Stars was also helped by a long history of second tier hockey in the area. The minor league Central Hockey League had two teams in the area, the Fort Worth Texans and the Dallas Blackhawks for three decades before the Stars arrival.|$|R
25|$|In 2013, Recchi {{joined the}} Dallas Stars as a {{consultant}} along with former Stars Mike <b>Modano</b> and Marty Turco.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010 off-season, the Stars {{released}} Marty Turco and Mike <b>Modano,</b> {{the face}} of the franchise for the past two decades. <b>Modano</b> subsequently signed with the Detroit Red Wings while Turco joined the Chicago Blackhawks. Winger Jere Lehtinen, who played his entire career with the Stars, announced his retirement in December 2010. The team also made key acquisitions, such as winger Adam Burish (who was on the 2010 Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks) and goaltender Andrew Raycroft. They also gave Jonathan Cheechoo a try-out, but he was cut and later signed with division rivals San Jose Sharks.|$|E
25|$|To {{celebrate}} the team's 25th anniversary, the team wore a commemorative patch {{on the left}} shoulder of their uniforms. The patch depicted Bill Goldsworthy, wearing a green uniform, facing off against Mike <b>Modano,</b> wearing the new black uniform.|$|E
25|$|Having led the NHL in 2007–08 with a plus-minus of +41 and 144 takeaways (58 {{more than}} Mike <b>Modano's</b> second-best total of 86), Datsyuk {{was awarded the}} Frank J. Selke Trophy as the League' best {{defensive}} forward. With just 20 penalty minutes, he also won the Lady Byng Trophy. In voting for the Selke, Datsyuk received 537 points (43 first place votes) while John Madden of the New Jersey Devils received 447 points and Datsyuk's linemate Henrik Zetterberg received 425 points. In voting for the Lady Byng, Datsyuk received 985 points (75 first place votes). In addition, Datsyuk became the first NHL player to win the Lady Byng three consecutive times in over 70 years, since Frank Boucher of the New York Rangers won from 1933 to 1935. Datsyuk and Ron Francis are the only players to have been awarded both the Selke and Lady Byng trophies during their careers.|$|R
50|$|In Game 1, Edmonton {{scored two}} {{goals in the}} second period 3:48 apart to take the lead and then win the game 2-1. Dallas {{controlled}} Game 2 by allowing only 13 shots on goal, and five different players scored in a 6-1 victory including Scott Young who had two goals and an assist. In Game 3, Edmonton scored three times within 3:05 to take a 3-2 lead early in the third period to win the game. Eric Brewer assisted on two of the goals. The Stars evened the series in Game 4 by scoring 23 seconds apart in the third period taking a 3-1 victory as a result. In Game 5, Sergei Zubov scored two goals in a 5-2 win for the Stars. Although Edmonton tied the game {{in the second period}} after being down two goals, Mike <b>Modano's</b> goal at 13:08 of the third period proved to be the series-winner.|$|R
25|$|These numbers remain retired {{with the}} Dallas Stars today. In {{addition}} to Goldsworthy and Masterton, the Stars have retired the number 7 of Neal Broten, {{who played with}} the North Stars from 1981 to 1993, and the number 9 of Mike <b>Modano</b> who played from 1988 to 1993.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Neal Broten was {{inducted}} into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. In 2009, Brett Hull became the first Dallas Stars player inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, followed by Ed Belfour and Joe Nieuwendyk in 2011 and Mike <b>Modano</b> in 2014. In 2010, brothers Derian and Kevin Hatcher were inducted to the United States Hockey Hall of Fame.|$|E
25|$|The Minnesota North Stars were an NHL {{team that}} was part of the 1967 NHL Expansion and played their home games at Met Center in Bloomington. They {{appeared}} in the 1981 and 1991 Stanley Cup Finals, but did not win either one of them. In 1993, the North Stars moved to Dallas, where they became the Dallas Stars. Notable players include Harry Howell, John Mariucci, Gump Worsley, Neal Broten and Mike <b>Modano.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Detroit Compuware Hockey {{organization}} {{was founded in}} the mid 1970s by Compuware owner/president Peter Karmanos and his partner Thomas Thewes. The organization grew to include all age levels of hockey including Junior 'A'. The Junior 'A 'team competed in the North American Hockey League. Some of its alumni include Eric Lindros, Pat LaFontaine, Mike <b>Modano,</b> David Legwand, Derian Hatcher and Doug Weight. The program was so successful that its owners endeavored to expand the Compuware Ambassador program to play at a higher level.|$|E
25|$|The Stars' 2009–10 {{season was}} similar to the {{previous}} one. Inconsistent play and defensive struggles plagued the team throughout the season, as they failed to adjust to Marc Crawford's new offensively-minded system, and owner Tom Hicks' financial troubles prevented the team from spending more than $45million on payroll, over $11million beneath the league salary cap. The Stars failed to win more than three games in a row all season, finished in last in the Pacific Division and repeated their 12th place conference finish from the year before with a record of 37–31–14 for 88 points. This {{was the first time that}} they would miss the playoffs two seasons in a row since the Stars moved to Texas. In the off-season, longtime goaltender Marty Turco was let go in favor of Kari Lehtonen to become the team's number one goaltender for the future. In the last game of the season at the Minnesota Wild, Mike <b>Modano</b> was named the game's first star and skated around the rink after the game wearing his North Stars uniform, receiving a rousing ovation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} round of the playoffs, Dallas faced their playoff arch-rivals, the Edmonton Oilers. The Stars swept the Oilers in four tough games, winning Game 4 in the third {{overtime}} on a goal by Joe Nieuwendyk. They then faced the St. Louis Blues in the second round. After taking a 2–0 series lead, the Blues stormed back to tie the series. The Stars then won the next two games to beat the Blues in six games. The series again ended on an overtime goal, this time from Mike <b>Modano.</b> In the Conference Finals, they faced the Colorado Avalanche for the first time in Stars history. This would be the first of four playoff meetings between the Stars and Avalanche in the next seven years. After both the Stars and the Avalanche split the first four games at a 2–2 series tie, the Avalanche won Game 5 by a score of 7–5, taking a 3–2 series lead, The Stars rallied winning game six on the road, and game seven at home, both by 4–1 scores.|$|E
25|$|After 1984, the {{franchise}} {{would only have}} one more winning season in Minnesota, in 1985-86. Seemingly, {{the franchise}} hit bottom in 1987-88, when it won only 19 games, still the second-fewest wins in franchise history. However, the Norris Division was so weak that year (only the Red Wings finished with a winning record) that the North Stars and Toronto Maple Leafs were fighting it out for the last playoff spot from the division {{on the last day}} of the season despite having the two worst records in the league. In those days, the four top teams in each division made the playoffs, regardless of record. A loss to the Calgary Flames not only kept the North Stars out of the playoffs, but assured them of the worst record in the league. While the late 1980s saw the franchise draft what would turn out to be their greatest player – forward Mike <b>Modano</b> – chronic attendance problems spurred the owners to threaten to move the club to the San Francisco Bay Area, against the league's wishes.|$|E
500|$|In business, Hull {{was twice}} {{involved}} {{in the operation of}} restaurants. [...] He owned two eateries in St. Louis while {{he was a member of}} the Blues, and partnered with Mike <b>Modano</b> and others on a Dallas restaurant called [...] "Hully and Mo Restaurant and Tap Room" [...] following his playing career. He lent his name to a 1995 Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game called Brett Hull Hockey. Hull was a co-owner of the St. Louis Bandits, a junior team in the North American Hockey League.|$|E
500|$|Remaining {{in hockey}} {{following}} {{the end of}} his playing career, Nieuwendyk joined the Florida Panthers' front office as a consultant to general manager Jacques Martin in 2007. [...] He left the Panthers after one year to join the Maple Leafs as special assistant to general manager Cliff Fletcher in 2008. He served as assistant general manager for the silver-medal winning Canadian national team at the 2009 World Championships, and on June 1, 2009, was named General Manager of the Dallas Stars. [...] His ability to make moves was at times limited by the financial difficulty of team owner Tom Hicks. [...] Among Nieuwendyk's decisions in his first two seasons as general manager was to allow popular former captain Mike <b>Modano</b> to leave the organization after 22 years with the franchise in 2010. Nieuwendyk stated such moves were difficult, as he played with <b>Modano</b> and considered him a friend. Nieuwendyk was released as Stars' general manager {{at the conclusion of the}} 2012–13 NHL season as team owner Tom Gaglardi stated that the team wanted to [...] "take this organization in a different direction". [...] On September 3, 2014, the Carolina Hurricanes announced they had hired him as a pro scout and advisor.|$|E
500|$|The first American {{player in}} NHL history to score 500 goals and 1,000 points, Mullen's career totals of 502 goals and 1,063 points stood as American records until surpassed by Mike <b>Modano</b> and Phil Housley, respectively. Along {{with his brother}} Brian, Mullen was named a {{recipient}} of the Lester Patrick Award in 1995 in recognition of his contributions to hockey in the United States. [...] He {{was inducted into the}} United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1998, and two years later, to the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 2011, the St. Louis Blues honored four players who wore uniform number 7 for their team. Mullen, Red Berenson, Garry Unger and Keith Tkachuk were each celebrated as part of the ceremony.|$|E
500|$|The Devils {{completed}} the comeback against the Flyers with a 2–1 victory and faced off against the defending Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars in the Stanley Cup Finals. [...] Stevens and Rafalski were tasked {{with the responsibility}} of shutting down Dallas' scoring line of Mike <b>Modano,</b> Brett Hull, and Joe Nieuwendyk. Stevens scored the game-winner {{in the first game}} of the series, en route to a Devils 7-3 victory; the goal was his third of the playoffs. The Devils went on to win the Finals in six games, after Game Five went to three overtimes and Game Six was decided in double overtime. [...] Stevens earned an assist on Jason Arnott's Cup-winning goal, and won the Conn Smythe Trophy for his leadership role on the team.|$|E
500|$|Hull tied Mike <b>Modano</b> for the American scoring lead at the 1991 Canada Cup {{with nine}} points. He led the Americans into the tournament final against Canada, but was held {{pointless}} in the decisive game as Canada won the tournament with a 4–2 game. Canadian fans turned on Hull at the inaugural World Cup of Hockey in 1996. [...] In the semifinal against Russia, fans in Ottawa loudly booed Hull and chanted [...] "traitor" [...] towards {{him as he}} scored two goals to lead the United States to the final against Canada. In the deciding game of the best-of-three final, Hull scored a key goal as the Americans turned a 2–1 deficit with five minutes to play into a 5–2 victory and captured the championship. Hull led all players with 11 points and was a tournament all-star at forward.|$|E
500|$|Making his Olympic {{debut at}} the 1998 Winter Games, Hull scored two goals in four games. The Americans were quickly {{eliminated}} from the tournament and were criticized for their lack of desire and leadership. The team was further embarrassed when it was discovered some members had trashed their hotel room following their elimination. [...] Hull was initially blamed as being a culprit. He angrily denied the accusation and claimed it was an invention of Canadian media upset that he was playing for the United States. Hull, <b>Modano</b> and John LeClair formed the American's top line for the 2002 Olympics. [...] The trio were dominant {{throughout most of the}} tournament, leading Team USA to the gold medal game against Canada. Hull and LeClair finished second and third in overall scoring, respectively; however they were held pointless against Team Canada in the final. [...] Hull and the Americans settled for the silver medal following a 5–2 defeat.|$|E
