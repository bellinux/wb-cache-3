500|$|As {{the weeks}} passed, Heywood calmly {{occupied}} himself by resuming his {{studies of the}} Tahitian language. Meanwhile the family—Nessy in particular—busied itself on his behalf, and another plea was made to the Earl of Chatham, in heart-rending terms. Shortly afterwards came the first indication that a royal pardon was in the offing, and on 26 October, on Hector's quarterdeck, this was formally read to Heywood and Morrison by Captain Montagu. Heywood responded with a short statement that ended: [...] "I receive with gratitude my Sovereign's mercy, for which <b>my</b> <b>future</b> life will be faithfully devoted to his service." [...] According to a Dutch newspaper which reported the case, his contrition {{was accompanied by a}} [...] "flood of tears". William Muspratt, the only other of the accused to employ legal counsel, was reprieved on a legal technicality and pardoned in February 1793.|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} Brown's laugh, {{followed}} by [...] "undislodgeable [...] piano notes." [...] Over these notes, the first {{lines of the}} refrain are rapped in a call and response interaction between Brown and Halliwell. The words [...] "tell," [...] "really" [...] and [...] "I wanna" [...] are repeated, so that the vocal tone and lyrics build up an image of female self-assertion. The refrain ends with the word [...] "zigazig-ha," [...] a euphemism for female desire, which is ambiguously sexualised or broadly economic. The first verse follows; Brown, Halliwell, Chisholm, Bunton sing one line individually, in that order. In this part, the lyrics have a pragmatic sense of control of the situation; they begin, [...] "If you want <b>my</b> <b>future,</b> forget my past." [...] This, according to musicologist Sheila Whiteley, taps directly into the emotions of the young teenage audience.|$|E

500|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1850, Fuller wrote to a friend: [...] "It has long seemed that in the year 1850 I should stand on some important plateau in the ascent of life... I feel however no marked and important change as yet." [...] Also that year, Fuller wrote: [...] "I am absurdly fearful and various omens have combined {{to give me a}} dark feeling... It seems to me that <b>my</b> <b>future</b> upon earth will soon close... I have a vague expectation of some crisis—I know not what". A few days after writing this, Fuller, Ossoli, and their child began a five-week return voyage to the United States aboard the ship Elizabeth, an American merchant freighter carrying cargo that included mostly marble from Carrara. They set sail on May 17. At sea, the ship's captain, Seth Hasty, died of smallpox. Angelino contracted the disease and recovered.|$|E
500|$|James Lance Bass {{was born}} in Laurel, Mississippi, to James Irvin Bass, Jr., a medical technologist, and Diane (née Pulliam), a middle school mathematics, English, and career {{discovery}} teacher. Along with his older sister, Stacy, Bass grew up in adjacent Ellisville, Mississippi, and was raised as a Southern Baptist. Bass has described his family as devoutly Christian and conservative and has said that his childhood was [...] "extremely happy". As a young boy, Bass developed an interest in space, and at age 9 traveled to Cape Canaveral, Florida, with his father to watch his first live space shuttle launch. Of this experience Bass said, [...] "I was certain from then on that <b>my</b> <b>future</b> was {{to be involved with}} space." [...] Shortly after, Bass attended space camp in Titusville, Florida, and aspired to attend college and study engineering, with the hope that he would one day work for NASA.|$|E
500|$|After England had amassed 496 in {{the first}} innings, Australia had slumped to 3/68 with Bradman one of the {{dismissed}} batsmen. Harvey, {{the youngest member of}} the squad, joined cavalier all-rounder Keith Miller.

500|$|McClintock {{began her}} studies at Cornell's College of Agriculture in 1919. There, she participated in student {{government}} and {{was invited to}} join a sorority, though she soon realized that she preferred not to join formal organizations. Instead, McClintock took up music, specifically jazz. She studied botany, receiving a BSc in 1923. Her interest in genetics began when she took her first course in that field in 1921. The course {{was based on a}} similar one offered at Harvard University, and was taught by C. B. Hutchison, a plant breeder and geneticist. Hutchison was impressed by McClintock's interest, and telephoned to invite her to participate in the graduate genetics course at Cornell in 1922. McClintock pointed to Hutchison's invitation as the reason she continued in genetics: [...] "Obviously, this telephone call cast the die for <b>my</b> <b>future.</b> I remained with genetics thereafter." [...] Although {{it has been reported that}} women could not major in genetics at Cornell, and therefore her MA and PhD—earned in 1925 and 1927, respectively—were officially awarded in botany, recent research has revealed that women did earn graduate degrees in Cornell's Plant Breeding Department during the time that McClintock was a student at Cornell.|$|E
500|$|The Shins {{were not}} truly a band when James Mercer {{composed}} the song, {{and the idea}} of making music his career seemed uncertain. The song's creation was partially a reaction to the music scene in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the band's hometown, which Mercer described as [...] "macho, really heavy, and aggressive." [...] He characterized it as a punk rock-esque move akin to giving the finger to the entire town. The song was born out of frustration regarding his personal life and future. [...] "It's definitely a moment in my life, that sort of angst and confusion about what <b>my</b> <b>future</b> was going to be," [...] he remarked. He described it as a [...] "Saturn return" [...] period of his life, in which he felt he could not relate to anyone in his hometown and his life there had become depressing. He had become a [...] "hermit" [...] working on the band's debut album, Oh, Inverted World, and had lost interest in partying with friends. The line [...] "Gold teeth and a curse for this town" [...] refers to his songwriting talent and his feelings on Albuquerque.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of being captain, Evra bore the brunt of the criticism. However, despite the public ridicule, Evra {{maintained}} his stance regarding his future with the national team, stating, [...] "I can’t see <b>my</b> <b>future</b> without the France team." [...] On 17 March 2011, he was called up to the national team by new manager Laurent Blanc {{for the first time since}} the 2010 World Cup. He had been eligible to return to the team since the previous month after serving his five-match suspension, however he was not called up to the team by Blanc, with the manager citing [...] "sporting reasons" [...] as the reason. Evra made his return to the team on 25 March in the team's Euro 2012 qualifying match against Luxembourg. He started the match and played the full 90 minutes in a 2–0 win. Four days later, Evra appeared on the bench in his first match at the Stade de France since the World Cup, against Croatia. After appearing regularly in qualifying for Euro 2012, on 29 May 2012, he was named to the 23-man squad to participate in the finals of the competition. France were eliminated in the quarter-finals following a 2–0 defeat against eventual champions Spain.|$|E

The director uses all means to his disposal to keep the viewer engaged and interested {{in the life of the}} main protagonist, Nemo Nobody." [...] Fred Topel, writing for Screen Junkies, praised the film's artistry, saying [...] "All of Nemo's lives are painful. No matter what he chooses, he experiences heartbreak, death of loved ones, his own death, and clinical depression. <b>My</b> <b>future</b> seems brighter, but the film makes the strong point that every experience is worthwhile. The goal isn't to choose the easiest path. It's to live." [...] Chris Holt from Starburst magazine wrote that [...] "Mr. Nobody is a film that is remarkable by its very existence and that in itself is something to be happy about. You may love it you may hate it, but you can bet that you will never forget it." [...] Exclaim!s Robert Bell called the film [...] "a powerful movie about what it means to be alive." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Marc Cherry {{was in a}} {{precarious}} financial situation and was having trouble finding a job. He commented, [...] "I was broke, unable to get even an interview for a writing job, and seriously concerned about <b>my</b> <b>future.</b> I had just turned forty and was starting to wonder if I {{was one of those}} deluded writers that wander around Hollywood, convincing themselves they're talented when all the evidence points to the contrary." [...] While watching television coverage of the Andrea Yates trials with his mother, Cherry turned to her and asked, [...] "Can you imagine being so desperate that you would do that to your children?" [...] to which his mother replied, [...] "I've been there." [...] Cherry was intrigued by the idea that a [...] "perfectly sane, rational woman could have the life she wanted, being a wife and mother... and still have moments of insanity;" [...] he began writing the pilot episode soon after. Cherry originally developed the concept as a half-hour comedy. However, after his agent was arrested for embezzlement, Cherry signed with Paradigm Talent Agency, where he was advised to rewrite the script as a soap opera. Cherry completed the first draft of the pilot in April 2002 and pitched the script to CBS, NBC, Fox, HBO, Showtime, and Lifetime, all of which turned it down.|$|E
500|$|Evelyn Waugh's {{professional}} and private circumstances, {{in the years}} after the Second World War, prefigured those of his fictional counterpart Pinfold. Before the war he had established himself as a writer, mainly of light satirical fiction. His wartime experiences, including service in the Royal Marines and the Royal Horse Guards, changed his personal and literary outlook, and put him into what his biographer David Wykes describes as [...] "a mood of introspection... that endured {{to the end of his}} career". Despite occasional reversions to his former style, in general Waugh's post-war fiction aspired to a more serious purpose. In an essay published in Life magazine in April 1946, he wrote: [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>future</b> books there will be two things to make them unpopular: a preoccupation with style and the attempt to represent man more fully, which, to me, means only one thing, man in his relation to God." [...] The commercial success of Brideshead Revisited, published in 1945, provided Waugh with the financial means to pursue his writing career in a leisurely fashion. He worked intermittently on his novel Helena for five years, while completing shorter projects and carrying out much unpaid work, particularly for Catholic organisations. In a marked change from his pre-war life, he ceased to socialise and became increasingly concerned to protect his privacy. To this end he adopted an overtly hostile persona as a defence mechanism, to repel the outside world.|$|E

[...] Hilson said that she wrote the song with Spears in mind after Danja played her the instrumental, adding, [...] "I just started singing, 'Give me, Give me,' and added a little more in and just having fun and messing around really." [...] Spears began recording the track in Las Vegas in August 2006, while she was seven months pregnant with her second child, Jayden James. Recording continued at Spears' house in Los Angeles, California, three weeks after she gave birth. Hilson commented that [...] "She gave 150 percent.

500|$|Robben was inflicted {{with yet}} another injury in a match against Liverpool on 20 January 2007. Robben made his return in a 3–0 victory against Middlesbrough in February, driving in a shot that took a {{deflection}} past Mark Schwarzer for an own goal by Abel Xavier. He came on {{as a substitute for}} Claude Makélélé in the 2007 League Cup final against Arsenal and set up the winning goal for Didier Drogba. Robben scored a goal {{in the second round of}} the Champions League against Porto, which led to Chelsea winning the tie 3–2 on aggregate. At the end of March 2007, Robben underwent a knee operation after sustaining a knee injury upon returning from international duty that was expected to rule him out for at least four weeks. He only made two further appearances for Chelsea, both of which were as a substitute and both of which would prove to be key games for the club. His first appearance since returning from injury was against Liverpool in the Champions League semi-final second leg which went to penalties. Robben went on to have his penalty saved by Pepe Reina, and Chelsea ultimately lost. His final appearance for the club came against Manchester United in the 2007 FA Cup Final. Robben replaced Joe Cole at half-time, but was then substituted himself for Ashley Cole in extra time as Chelsea emerged victorious. Spanish club Real Madrid were interested in two of Chelsea's players. Then manager Bernd Schuster is said to have demanded Michael Ballack, while Real Madrid's then president Ramón Calderón was known to favour Robben. Robben said to reporters of Spanish newspaper AS, [...] "I do not know when a deal will be reached.

500|$|Bridges re-joined Conference National side Kettering Town on 1 August 2011, {{signing a}} two-year {{deal with the}} club.

There comes a time when you can't wait any longer and I needed to sort <b>my</b> <b>future</b> out so here we are". Bridges made his Kettering Town debut in a 2–0 away win at Lincoln City on 10 September 2011, the club's first away victory of the season. After making just five appearances for Kettering, Bridges was transfer-listed by new manager Mark Stimson on 29 September. Despite being transfer-listed due to Kettering's financial problems, Bridges continued to play in the first-team, and he scored his first goal for the club in a 2–2 draw against Ebbsfleet United, scoring from close range to give the club an initial one-goal lead. Bridges scored once again in a 2–1 home defeat to Grimsby Town on 26 November 2011, scoring in injury-time to half the deficit. Bridges was forced to take training following the departure of Stimson, with only six other Kettering players turning up to train due to unpaid wages. Despite the off-field problems, he remained ever-present {{for the remainder of the}} season, playing 38 times in all competitions, and scoring his third and final goal of the campaign in a 1–1 home draw with Barrow in April 2012. Kettering were relegated, finishing bottom of the league, and faced a further relegation due to entering a Company Voluntary Arrangement. Bridges had one year remaining on his contract at Kettering, but left in July 2012, calling the campaign the [...] "worst of his career".|$|E
