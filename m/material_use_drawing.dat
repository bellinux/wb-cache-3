40|$|International audienceOn site Raman {{analyses}} were performed at the Musée national de Céramique, Sèvres, France, on Kütahya pottery. A comparison is made with Iznik and Safavid productions. Two Raman signatures of silicate glazes (with an index of polymerisation ~ 0. 6 - 1 indicating a lead silicate composition, with characteristic Si-O stretching doublet at ~ 985 and 1050 cm- 1) are recognized and associated with the colour. Considering the peak position and the ratios of Qn (n = 1, 2 and 3) components allow for the classification of the different productions. Differentiation between Kütahya and Iznik Ottoman pottery is straightforward from the centres of gravity. The procedure is also efficient to discriminate between early and late Iznik production. The white colour arises from a alpha-quartz slip. Although Iznik production does not fluctuate, {{as a consequence of}} the nakkashame regulation, composition/nanostructure dispersion of Kûtahya wares is large and different families can be recognized.

40|$|This is a {{paper about}} the topological presuppositions that frame the {{performance}} of social similarity and difference.

First, there are 'regions' in which objects are clustered together, and boundaries are drawn round each cluster. Second, there are 'networks' in which distance is a function of relations between elements, and difference a matter of relational variety. These two forms of spatiality are often mobilized in social theory. However, we argue that there are other kinds of social space, and here consider the possible character of a third, that of 'fluid spatiality'. In this, places are neither delineated by boundaries, nor linked through stable relations: instead, entities may be similar and dissimilar at different locations within fluid space. In addition, they may transform themselves without creating difference...|$|R
40|$|Batik {{is a form}} {{of visual}} art on textile <b>materials</b> {{produced}} <b>using</b> traditional <b>drawing</b> techniques originating from Indonesia. For the Javanese, batik is a traditional cloth integral to their cultural identity. Visuals on ornaments of batik cloths illustrate the life sayings and values upon which the life of the community is laid. The study focuses on identifying the values found in Indonesian batik ornaments which are adapted as visual content on the Nitiki game. The findings are then used to reconstruct the values that represent the real batik culture. This study employs the qualitative descriptive method by collecting dozens of batik ornaments on the Nitiki game, exploring the values mentioned in literature, sorting out the dominant values, and reconstructing them. The findings suggest that the values found in Indonesian batik ornaments in the Nitiki game clearly show the patterns of how traditional culture of batik survives and thrives in Indonesian society, as well as show the flexibility of batik against the current development of modern culture, including its integration as culture-based content in interactive media. This study contributes to the dissertation research on aesthetical interaction in cultural content-based game...|$|R

Twenty reference <b>materials</b> were <b>used</b> to <b>draw</b> calibration curves with the headspace solid–phase microextraction (HS–SPME) method. By calculating the calibration curves, obtaining the quantifications of each component, and determining the area ratio of mass numbers by diluting the reference materials of each substance, the coefficients of determination are {{shown to be a}} minimum of 0. 997, e. g., α–Pinene (R 2 = 0. 997) and β–Pinene (R 2 = 0. 998), and a high reproducibility is indicated. Detection and quantification limits are below 0. 07 and 0. 24 ng, respectively, for all materials. To determine the amount of NVOCs measured in the atmosphere within forests, sampling was performed for a total of 14 air volume sections collected from a coniferous region using disposable tubes from September to October 2012. The results of the comparative analysis of the detected NVOC substances in these air volumes show the highest efficiency in the 9 L section.

40|$|This {{research}} shows how job postings can lead job candidates {{to see themselves}} as particularly deserving of hiring and high salary. We propose that these entitlement beliefs entail both personal motivations to see oneself as deserving and the ability to justify those motivated judgments. Accordingly, we predict that people feel more deserving when qualifications for a job are vague and thus amenable to motivated reasoning, whereby people use information selectively to reach a desired conclusion. We tested this hypothesis with a 2 -phase experiment (N = 892) <b>using</b> <b>materials</b> <b>drawn</b> from real online job postings. In {{the first phase of the}} experiment, participants believed themselves to be more deserving of hiring and deserving of higher pay after reading postings composed of vaguer types of qualifications. In the second phase, yoked observers believed that participants were less entitled overall, but did not selectively discount endorsement of vaguer qualifications, suggesting they were unaware of this effect. A follow-up preregistered experiment (N = 905) using postings with mixed qualification types replicated the effect of including more vague qualifications on participants' entitlement beliefs. Entitlement beliefs are widely seen as problematic for recruitment and retention, and these results suggest that reducing the inclusion of vague qualifications in job postings would dampen the emergence of these beliefs in applicants, albeit at the cost of decreasing application rates and lowering applicants' confidence.
