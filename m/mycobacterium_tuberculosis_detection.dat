Methods: A prevalence survey of respiratory diseases was conducted in two homeless shelters in Marseilles, in February 2005. A multidisciplinary team including infectious diseases specialists, lung specialists, residents, nurses, physiotherapists and X-ray technicians visited the two shelters.

40|$|AIMS: To {{assess the}} {{performance}} of three commercially available <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>detection</b> systems employing nucleic acid amplification, when applied directly to respiratory and non-respiratory specimens from patients where the diagnosis of tuberculosis is difficult using clinical and traditional bacteriological methods. METHODS: 42 respiratory and 21 non-respiratory specimens were concentrated, examined with auramine staining, and cultured on Lowenstein-Jensen slopes. These specimens were also assayed using the Amplicor Mycobacterium tuberculosis test (AM) (Roche Diagnostic Systems), the Amplified Mycobacterium tuberculosis direct test (AMD) (Gen-Probe), and the LCx Mycobacterium tuberculosis assay (LMA) (Abbott Laboratories). RESULTS: All three amplification systems {{used in this study}} gave specificities of 100 % when used on respiratory specimens. When used on non-respiratory specimens, AM and LMA gave specificities of 100 % and AMD 75 %. With respiratory specimens the AM, AMD, and LMA systems gave sensitivities of 75 %, 65. 2 %, and 79. 2 %, respectively. With non-respiratory specimens the sensitivities were 50 %, 66. 7 %, and 60 %, while with smear negative, culture positive specimens they were 33. 3 %, 66. 7 %, and 55. 6 %. Positive predictive values of 100 % were seen with all specimens except non-respiratory specimens assayed using AMD where the value was 66. 7 %. CONCLUSIONS: The manufacturers of these systems recommend that they should only be used for the direct analysis of respiratory specimens, and the US Food and Drug Administration has approved them for use only with smear positive specimens. This study confirms that sensitivities are lower for non-respiratory and smear negative specimens, but positive predictive values are high.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Early {{diagnosis}} and treatment of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) saves lives, but current laboratory diagnostic tests lack sensitivity and the best treatment regimens are uncertain. This article reviews the advances towards better TBM {{diagnosis and}} treatments made over the last 2 years. RECENT FINDINGS: A modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain, interferon-gamma release assays and <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> antigen <b>detection</b> assays have all shown promise as new TBM diagnostic tests. HIV-associated TBM carries an especially grave prognosis and there are new data describing the optimal timing of antiretroviral treatment initiation and the clinical predictors of TBM immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of different fluoroquinolones for TBM treatment have been compared, and there are intriguing new data to suggest higher doses of rifampicin given intravenously may improve the survival. Finally, there are preliminary data to suggest that the beneficial effect of adjunctive corticosteroids on TBM survival may be augmented by aspirin and predicted by a polymorphism in a gene responsible for eicosanoid synthesis. SUMMARY: Much remains to be done to improve the outcome from TBM. There have been important advances in the treatment, which may influence treatment guidelines in the near future, but there remains an urgent need for better diagnostic tests...|$|R
40|$|SummaryNucleic acid {{amplification}} {{tests for}} <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> (MTB) <b>detection</b> from sputum are highly sensitive and specific with smear microscopy positive specimens, but their sensitivity with smear-negative/culture-positive specimens is much lower; therefore, these tests cannot {{rule out a}} tuberculosis diagnosis. Co-extraction of PCR inhibitors may be a cause of decreased test sensitivity. Here the design and early validation of a MTB screening assay with sample preparation and qPCR methods designed to specifically address this diagnostic gap is reported. First, human genomic DNA is identified as a significant qPCR inhibitor. To circumvent this problem, a novel, streamlined sample preparation method utilizing detergent and proteolysis to thin the sputum and DNA sequence specific MTB DNA isolation was developed. Additionally, a multiplexed qPCR assay targeting two MTB complex-specific loci: the potentially multi-copy IS 6110 and the single-copy senX 3 -regX 3, combined with the cotJC gene from Bacillus atrophaeus spores amplified as a process control was developed. The limit of detection of the test {{was estimated to be}} 20  cfu/ml which is significantly lower than the Xpert® MTB/RIF assay.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the diagnostic performance of three real-time PCR kits and evaluate the concordance with two older PCR methods. Materials and Methods: Using 128 samples, the five PCR methods were assessed, including an in-house PCR protocol, the COBAS Amplicor MTB, the CO-BAS TaqMan MTB, the AdvanSure TB/NTM real-time PCR, and the Real-Q M. tuberculosis kit. The discrepant results were further examined by DNA sequencing and using the AdvanSure Mycobacteria Genotyping Chip for complete analysis. Results: For <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> (MTB) <b>detection,</b> all five kits showed 100 % matching results (positive; N = 11 and negative; N = 80).

Conclusion: Real-time PCR, yielded results that were comparable to those of the older PCR methods for detecting MTB. However, there were disagreements among the applied kits in regard to the sample test results for detecting NTM.

40|$|Pyrazinamide (PZA), {{an analog}} of nicotinamide, is a prodrug for {{tuberculosis}} which requires conversion to the bactericidal compound pyrazinoic acid by bacterial pyrazinamidase activity. Mutations {{leading to a}} loss of pyrazinamidase activity cause PZA resistance in <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis.</b> Thus, the <b>detection</b> of pyrazinamidase activity makes the discrimination of PZA-resistant tuberculosis possible. However, the detection of the pyrazinamidase activity of M. tuberculosis isolates needs a large amount of bacilli and is therefore time consuming. In this paper, we describe a new method for the detection of pyrazinamidase activity with a PCR-based system. The genes encoding pyrazinamidase (pncA genes) in 30 resistant clinical isolates were amplified by PCR by using forward primers containing bacteriophage T 7 promoter sequences at their 5 " ends. Then the PCR products were directly subjected to an in vitro transcription-translation coupled system. All of the PZA-resistant isolates tested showed reduced pyrazinamidase activity compared to susceptible M. tuberculosis type strain H 37 Rv. In contrast, all of the 15 susceptible clinical isolates exhibited pyrazinamidase activities similar to that of H 37 Rv.

This study determined the diagnostic performance of MTBDRplus in BAL for MTB complex detection and isoniazid/rifampicin resistance in smear-negative and sputum scarce patients. Materials and Methods: Retrospective evaluation of data (January–December 2013) from patients who underwent bronchoscopy was done. Of these, patients with high TB suspicion with available data on acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear/culture and MTBDRplus were selected. Results of MTBDRplus were compared with AFB smear/culture and drug susceptibility. Sensitivity and specificity of MTBDRplus was determined using TB culture as gold standard. Results: Data on 383 patients who underwent bronchoscopy were collected. Of these, 154 previously untreated TB suspect patients that were either smear negative on sputum microscopy or sputum scarce were selected. Out of 154 patients, 11 were smear positive and 34 patients were AFB culture positive. MTBDRplus detected MTB in 23 / 34 cases, the sensitivity and specificity being 67. 6 % and 85 % (P < 0. 001) versus 32. 4 % and 100 % (P < 0. 001) compared to smear microscopy. All smear-positive cases (n = 11) were detected by MTBDRplus. There were no discrepancies between phenotypic drug susceptibility testing and LiPA for isoniazid and rifampicin resistance in patients.

Heat shock protein HSPX when attached to the N-termini of the antigens PE 35, tnPstS 1 and FbpC 1, all the fusion molecules were expressed at high levels in E. coli in a soluble form. ELISA analysis of the plasma samples of TB patients against HSPX-tnPstS 1 showed 57. 7 % sensitivity which is nearly the same as the expected combined value obtained after deducting the number of plasma samples (32) containing the antibodies against both the individual antigens. Likewise, the 54. 4 % sensitivity of HSPX-PE 35 was nearly the same as that expected from the combined values of the contributing antigens. Structural analysis of all the fusion molecules by CD spectroscopy showed that α-helical and β-sheet contents were found close to those obtained through molecular modeling. Molecular modeling studies of HSPX-tnPstS 1 and HSPX-PE 35 support the analytical results as most of the epitopes of the contributing antigens were found to be available for binding to the corresponding antibodies.
