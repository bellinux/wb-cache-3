In general the ethernet ports of each RP in the system will be connected to an out-of-band ethernet LAN so you keep control over the system even when the CSR wouldn't be able to route any data. If the CSR is installed at the same location as the configuration system you will probably use a dedicated ethernet LAN. If the CSR is in a different location you will probably connect this (configuration) <b>management</b> (<b>V)LAN</b> with your NOC via a network connection that doesn't use the CRS to route the data (or you have a fall-back method such as ISDN access to the local management LAN) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed to the {{problems}} of virtual local networks. In the first chapters are explained both basic and advanced methods of designing and management of virtual LAN networks. The following chapters are dedicated to the methods of effective <b>management</b> <b>VLAN</b> networks and to the protocol Spanning Tree, preventing formation of loops in redundant networks, and their exploitation in VLANs. The practical part describes the application of the implementation of the technology of virtual local networks in experimental network, containing various types of devices. Based on this theory, a laboratory assignment has been designed for the training of the students in solving such problems. The scope of the laboratory assignment is divided into simpler partial tasks, which even a less advanced student should be able to configure and test...|$|E
40|$|Nordsken {{is a game}} festival {{that shows}} the game and geek hobby to the public. Visitors can join in on tournaments and can try a large variety of {{computer}} and board games. Besides this, Nordsken invites different companies and lecturers who tell and show the best from the game and geek hobby. 600 participants gathered at Nordsken 2013 and over 1500 visitors came during these 3 days to play games and hangout with likeminded. As being responsible for Nordsken’s network, we had as a task to set up, configure and monitor the network during the entire event and act as support when needed. Ahead of the event a plan was introduced, which involved going through old documentation, buying a new server, renting switches and deployment of these devices. After a logical topology of the network was created, we began to configure all switches, wireless access points and the server. The network was split into three layers, core, distribution and access. The switches within each layer were configured depending on its location and connection. VLAN’s were created and configured into different sections based on {{the placement of the}} tables. On the server, we installed two virtual machines with Ubuntu 12. 04, one which included all the services and another which included all the management tools that were necessary. The services provided were DHCP for every VLAN, NAT for the <b>Management</b> <b>VLAN</b> and some firewall functionality. The tools that were used were Adiscon LogAnalyzer, FTP, Ubiquity Unifi Controller Software and Cacti with both the plug-ins, Thold and Monitor. Guides for installing and configuring these services are included in this thesis. All in all the event was a success when it comes to planning, installing, managing, and to take it down. The only big problem that occurred was that the wireless network didn´t function as well as we had hoped. We managed to solve the problem somewhat and the event went on as planned. The software that was installed and used on the server was chosen based on our past encounter with them during different labs at the university.

Many vendors (including Cisco) have turned to support dynamic VLAN assignments using the 802.1x authentication protocol with a Radius server that has additional attributes designating the VLAN.|$|R

From an operator standpoint, the system not only provides a network wide view of how VLANs are organized in an enterprise network but also assists them in performing actions like extending current VLANs and configuring new VLANs. Network managers can also use this toolkit to detect and diagnose subopti-mal root bridge placements and misconfigurations such as missing and redundant links.

40|$|Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) are {{extensively}} used in enterprise networks. However, their configuration {{remains an}} ad-hoc, complex and error-prone process today. We {{believe that to}} eliminate these difficulties, there is need for automation tools, and also need for visualization tools. In this paper, we report on our experience building a <b>VLAN</b> <b>management</b> toolkit, which automates and visualizes common VLAN configuration tasks. We begin by describing common misconfigurations, {{and their impact on}} network performance and security. We next present a set of algorithms that automate the VLAN configuration tasks. These algorithms form the back end of the toolkit. The front end of the toolkit consists of an interactive graphical user interface which provides visualization of VLAN operations at multiple granularities, and can be accessed remotely from a web browser. We {{are in the process of}} deploying the toolkit at a large campus network which has thousands of switches, and around 800 VLANs. Our initial operational experience shows that the toolkit is effective in both automating configuration tasks, and identifying common misconfigurations. In particular, we have found that (i) more than 40 % of the VLANs in the network have redundant links that may lead to security and performance issues. (ii) more than 30 % of the VLANs in the network have missing links which may result in connectivity issues and (iii) the root-bridge placements of more than 30 % of the VLANs are not optimum, which again may result in performance issues. We believe these insights highlight the benefit and importance of such a toolkit...|$|R
