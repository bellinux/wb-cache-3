50|$|Mrs. Danvers, the {{sinister}} housekeeper, was profoundly {{devoted to the}} first <b>Mrs.</b> <b>de</b> Winter, Rebecca, {{who died in a}} boating accident about a year before Maxim and the second <b>Mrs.</b> <b>de</b> Winter met. She continually attempts to undermine the new <b>Mrs.</b> <b>de</b> Winter psychologically, subtly suggesting to her that she will never attain the beauty, urbanity, and charm her predecessor possessed. Whenever the new <b>Mrs.</b> <b>de</b> Winter attempts to make changes at Manderley, Mrs. Danvers describes how Rebecca ran it when she was alive. Each time Mrs. Danvers does this, she implies that the new <b>Mrs.</b> <b>de</b> Winter lacks the experience and knowledge necessary for running an important estate. Cowed by Mrs. Danvers' imposing manner, the new mistress simply caves in.|$|R

Conradin despises <b>Mrs.</b> <b>De</b> Ropp, who takes delight in telling him off [...] "for his own good."

5000|$|The {{film was}} used as the basis of a sketch on the BBC comedy sketch show That Mitchell and Webb Look. In the skit, the plot is changed, at the insistence of the producer, to a prequel, set while the first <b>Mrs.</b> <b>de</b> Winter is still alive and has just begun living with Maxim. The humour is derived from {{references}} to the then-unknown second <b>Mrs.</b> <b>de</b> Winter scattered throughout the mansion, such as a dress [...] "reserved for the second <b>Mrs.</b> <b>de</b> Winter" [...] and a painting of a woman with her face covered and the letters [...] "TBA" [...] written.|$|R

As a result, Armand was forced to turn to King Louis XIV of France, from whom, in March 1700, he obtained original letters patent. This was widely reported in the Nouveau d'Hozier, who also made the observation that these letters patent resembled more an ennoblement than a confirmation.|$|E

25|$|On 27 October 1940, the General {{council was}} {{dissolved}} and the Mayors of Guadeloupe and its dependencies were relieved of their duties {{and replaced by}} prominent citizens appointed by the Vichy government. The mayor of Terre-de-Haut, Théodore Samson, {{was replaced by a}} Béké of Martinique, <b>Mr.</b> <b>de</b> Meynard. Popular gatherings were forbidden and freedom of expression was banned by the regime. A passive resistance to Vichy and its local representatives was organised from 1940 to 1943. More than 4,000 French West Indians left their islands, at the risk of their life, to join the nearby British colonies. Then they rallied the Free French Forces, first by undertaking military training in the United States, Canada or Great Britain. At the same time, Fort Napoléon became a political jail where the dissidents were locked. The Saintois boarded their traditional Saintoise to the Guadeloupean coast to pick up the volunteers for dissidence departure. Then, they were sailed through Dominica Passage, avoiding the cruisers and patrol boats of Admiral Robert.|$|E
500|$|Contrecœur {{prepared}} {{an official}} {{report of the}} action {{that was based on}} two sources. [...] Most of it came from a Canadien named Monceau who escaped the action but apparently did not witness Jumonville's slaying: [...] " [...] saw themselves surrounded by the English {{on one side and the}} Indians on the Other. [...] The English gave them two volleys, but the Indians did not fire. [...] <b>Mr.</b> <b>de</b> Jumonville, by his interpreter, told them to desist, that he had something to tell them. [...] Upon which they ceased firing. [...] Then <b>Mr.</b> <b>de</b> Jumonville ordered the Summons which I had sent them to retire, to be read ... Monceau saw all our Frenchmen coming up close to <b>Mr.</b> <b>de</b> Jumonville, whilst they were reading the Summons ... during which Time, said Monceau made the best of his Way to us". [...] Contrecœur's second source was an Indian from Tanacharison's camp, who reported that [...] "Mr. de Jumonville was killed by a Musket-Shot in the Head, whilst they were reading the Summons". The same Indian claimed that the Indians then rushed in to prevent the British from slaughtering the Frenchmen.|$|E
500|$|The local {{population}} in Miri has indeed started to extract oil from hand-dug wells for centuries. Song Huiyao Jigao, a {{documentation of the}} Song dynasty of China, mentions the imports of Borneo camphor and petroleum in the 11th century. In 1882, <b>Mr</b> <b>de</b> Crespigny reported to the Brooke government on 18 hand-dug oil wells in the Miri area. He also recommended that area near Miri River should be thoroughly explored. However, his recommendations were ignored. But when Charles Hose took over the Resident office in 1891, {{he was interested in}} <b>Mr</b> <b>de</b> Crespigny's idea and began to collaborate with him. <b>Mr</b> <b>de</b> Crespigny began to map oil seeps around the Miri area, however a consultant geologist from England discouraged the oil exploration in Miri due to poor logistical conditions. After his retirement from administrative positions in Sarawak, Charles Hose went back to England. He later went to London to discuss the idea of oil exploration in Miri with the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (later became a part of Royal Dutch Shell Company in 1907). Mr. H.N. Benjamin, a branch manager from the petroleum company, was interested in this idea. Finally in 1909, Rajah Charles Brooke came to London to sign the first Sarawak Oil Mining Lease. Royal Dutch Shell dispatched a senior geologist named Josef Theodor Erb together with Charles Hose back to Miri. Mr Erb started to map Miri oil fields from August 1909 to July 1910. He also identified a location known as [...] "Miri Hill" [...] (now known as [...] "Canada Hill", 150 m above sea level) is suitable to act as an anticline for oil drilling.|$|E

500|$|Washington's {{accounts}} of the battle exist in several versions; they are consistent with each other, but short on details. [...] He wrote in his diary, [...] "We were advanced pretty near to them ... when they discovered us; whereupon I ordered my company to fire ... Company ... received the whole Fire of the French, during the greatest Part of the Action, which only lasted a Quarter of an Hour, before the Enemy was routed. [...] We killed <b>Mr.</b> <b>de</b> Jumonville, the commander ... also nine others; we wounded one, and made Twenty-one Prisoners".|$|E
500|$|On February 28, 1894 Crispi {{presented}} the [...] "evidence" [...] for a widespread conspiracy in parliament: the so-called [...] "International Treaty of Bisacquino", {{signed by the}} French Government, the Czar of Russia, Giuseppe De Felice, the anarchists and the Vatican, with the goal to detach Sicily {{from the rest of}} the country and put it under a Franco-Russian protectorate. The Radical deputy Felice Cavallotti ridiculed the conspiracy of Crispi, poking fun at [...] "the famous treaty between the Emperor of Russia, the President of the French Republic, and <b>Mr</b> <b>De</b> Felice". The so-called [...] "Treaty of Bisacquino" [...] was so named not because it was signed in the Sicilian town, but because it had been invented by the Director of Public Safety of Bisacquino, the Neapolitan Sessi.|$|E
500|$|Charles Brooke succeeded James Brooke {{as the new}} Rajah of Sarawak in 1868. By 1883, Sultan of Brunei (Sultan Abdul Momin) ceded the Baram region (including Miri) to Charles Brooke. The fourth {{division}} of Sarawak was immediately created with the installation of Claude Champion de Crespigny as the first Resident of the Division. The Miri area was still a fishing village at that time. It was a small settlement surrounded by mangrove and Nipah palm jungles consisted of 20 scattered houses, a few wooden shops operated by Chinese traders and a lone Arab trader. A fort was built in Claudetown (present day Marudi, 43km {{to the east of}} Miri) in 1883. Claudetown became the administrative centre of the division. Mr Claude's administration was helped by two junior officers, 30 rangers, and a few native police. Charles Hose succeeded <b>Mr</b> <b>de</b> Crespigny as the new Resident in 1891 and the fort in Marudi was renamed as [...] "Fort Hose". To restore peace among various ethnic tribes fighting in the Baram region, Charles Hose decided to organise a peace conference at his fort in April 1899. This peace conference also led to the birth of first Baram Regatta, a long boat race competition among the natives which continued to be held until today.|$|E
