This means that the <b>member</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exporting</b> merchant does not collect VAT on the sale, but still gives the exporting merchant a credit for the VAT paid on the purchase by the exporter (in practice this often means a cash refund). The importing <b>member</b> <b>state</b> [...] "reverse charges" [...] the VAT. This means that the importer is required to pay VAT to the importing <b>member</b> <b>state</b> at its rate. In many cases a credit is immediately given for this as input VAT. The importer then charges VAT on resale in the normal way.|$|R

Also, the main factors that prompt the external competitiveness in these economies are determined. The results show that the most dynamic New <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> (NMS) in terms of market share and export volumes are Poland and the Czech Republic followed at some distance by Hungary and Romania. While Hungary and the Czech Republic have improved or maintained their price competitiveness throughout the analysed period, a few countries like Romania and Lithuania suffered a serious deterioration in this area due to increases in labour costs. After the onset of the international financial and economic crisis price competitiveness has been partially restored. In the case of non-price competitiveness, the most dynamic NMS is the Czech Republic. Romania is ranked quite low in this area and has experienced small improvements in the analysed period. external competitiveness, New <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> export volumes, market share. ...|$|R

In several countries, including the EU <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> the <b>export</b> <b>of</b> dual-use goods {{is controlled by}} national licensing processes {{as a measure of}} non-proliferation. Dual-use items relate to a variety of generally high-tech goods falling in diverse categories: nuclear materials, facilities and equipment; special materials and related equipment; materials processing; electronics; computers; telecommunications and information security; sensors and lasers; navigation and avionics; marine; aerospace and propulsion. In connection to the ongoing review <b>of</b> the EU <b>export</b> control policy, currently based on Regulation 428 / 2009 and amendments, it is of relevance to know the size of the EU dual-use sector and have a method to assess, in a quantitative way, the impact <b>of</b> <b>export</b> controls on trade. Because the dual-use trade draws from a range of industrial sectors, no single trade statistics exists today to portrait this cross-cutting sector ‘as a whole’. In this report we estimate the total intra- and extra-EU Dual-Use Export Value (DUEV). DUEV is meant to be an indicator of the relevance of the dual-use sector to the EU economy. To estimate DUEV, lower and upper bound values are first derived based on license data provided by EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and on COMEXT export data available from Eurostat. The bounds are then combined in a single estimate to DUEV. As a result, DUEV is estimated to be at most 3. 3 % of the total intra- and extra-EU export in 2013, equivalent to about 150 Billion of Euros. The report explains the method used to derive these figures by qualitative reasoning on quantitative data. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|R
