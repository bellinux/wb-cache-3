40|$|Mirena is a {{long acting}} intrauterine hormone-releasing (LNG-IUS) {{contraceptive}} system with a flexible plastic T-shaped frame bearing a levonorgestrel(LNG) -containing cylinder which releases small doses levonorgestrel into the uterine cavity after insertion with maximum effect on the endometrium and minimum progestogenic side-effect. LNG causes thinning of the endometrium, atrophy of the endometrial glands and decidualisation of the endometrial stroma. The most common side-effect of LNG-IUS is unscheduled vaginal bleeding in the first 3 months, so proper counseling is needed. In some cases functional ovarian cysts may occur which are relatively small, symptomless and resolved spontaneously within a short time. Mirena is now licensed {{for the treatment of}} menorrhagia in UK because it reduces 97 % of <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> in 12 months uses. It is also an effective progestogenic endometrial protection in women with Hormone replacement therapy. There are conflicting evidence of LNG-IUS in the management of Fibroids uterus but it reduces fibroid related <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>losses.</b> It has also some beneficial effect in endometriosis and adenomyosis by reducing pain and <b>blood</b> <b>loss.</b> The LNG-IUS also reduces endometrial hyperplasia and may take place in the treatment of eartly endometrial cancer in some cases.

5000|$|The {{suggestion}} that an additional factor might exist {{was made by}} Dr Paul Owren (1905-1990), a Norwegian physician, during his investigations into the bleeding tendency of a lady called Mary (1914-2002). She had suffered from nosebleeds and menorrhagia (excessive <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss)</b> for most her life, and {{was found to have}} a prolonged prothrombin time, suggesting either vitamin K deficiency or chronic liver disease leading to prothrombin deficiency. However, neither were the case, and Owren demonstrated this by correcting the abnormality with plasma from which prothrombin had been removed. Using Mary's serum as index, he found that the [...] "missing" [...] factor, which he labeled V (I-IV having been used in Morawitz' model), had particular characteristics. Most investigations were performed during the Second World War, and while Owren published his results in Norway in 1944, he could not publish them internationally until the war was over. They appeared finally in The Lancet in 1947.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the associations of iron depletion (ID) with <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>losses,</b> lifestyle, and dietary habits, in pubertal girls. The study sample comprised 1222 girls aged 9 – 13 years old. Biochemical, anthropometrical, dietary, clinical, and physical activity data were collected. Out of 274 adolescent girls with menses, 33. 5 % were found to be iron depleted (defined as serum ferritin < 12 [*]μg/L) compared to 15. 9 % out of 948 girls without menses. Iron-depleted girls without menses were found to have lower consumption of poultry (P= 0. 017) and higher consumption of fruits (P= 0. 044) and fast food (P= 0. 041) compared to their peers having normal iron status. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that girls with menses were 2. 57 (95 % CI: 1. 37, 4. 81) times more likely of being iron depleted compared to girls with no menses. Iron depletion was found to be associated with high calcium intake, high consumption of fast foods, and low consumption of poultry and fruits. Menses was the only factor that was found to significantly increase the likelihood of ID in these girls. More future research is probably needed in order to better understand the role of diet and menses in iron depletion...|$|R
40|$|Background: Reproductive-aged {{females are}} {{particularly}} {{at risk of}} developing iron deficiency, partly due to <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>losses.</b> Hormonal contraceptives (HC) may reduce <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> volume and frequency and potentially reduce iron deficiency risk. However, low meat consumption and excess body fat may increase iron deficiency risk through lowered absorption or utilisation of dietary iron by the body. Objective: To determine whether menstrual frequency and hormonal contraceptive practices differed between BMI category and regularity of meat consumption in female university students. Design: A 20 item questionnaire was conducted in female Griffith University, Gold Coast students aged = 25 years. All measures were self-report, including height and weight. Students {{were randomly selected from}} classes available on campus. Descriptive and chi-square analyses were conducted. Outcomes: Two thirds (66. 5 %, 547 / 822) of respondents were on HCs. Over half of respondents (52. 6 %) ate red meat less than twice weekly (low meat) or were vegetarian (V) (low meat & V= 448 / 850, low meat= 398, V= 50). Over half of respondents (54. 9 %, 449 / 818) were healthy weight, 10. 4 % overweight and 4. 2 % obese or morbidly obese. There was no association between menstrual frequency or HC use and BMI or lowered meat consumption (p> 0. 05). However obese respondents {{were less likely to be}} using HCs (? 2 = 8. 929, p= 0. 030), and more likely to have been pregnant (? 2 = 6. 867, p= 0. 009) and donated blood (? 2 = 9. 405, p= 0. 024). Conclusion: While HC use is commonplace amongst young female university students, young females with lifestyles that may increase their iron deficiency risk may not be more likely to reduce menstrual volume or frequency and subsequent iron loss through HC use.

40|$|Background: Women tend to {{have lower}} {{haemoglobin}} compared to men due to <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>losses.</b> This is often compounded by nutritional deficiencies. There is a further drop in haemoglobin during pregnancy due to red cell dilution. Pregnancy itself places a huge demand on maternal iron stores. High haemoglobin may reflect haemoconcentration due to {{a failure of the}} normal physiological expansion in plasma volume. Iron excess has also been associated with free-radical damage. In current practice, high maternal haemoglobin in pregnancy is often not given as much attention as anaemia. This study examines the association between high maternal haemoglobin in the third trimester and neonatal birth weights as well as other maternal and neonatal outcomes. Objectives: To determine the potential association between elevated third trimester maternal haemoglobin and neonatal gestational age adjusted birth weights at term. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, women delivering at the Aga Khan University Hospital’s maternity unit who had either normal or high haemoglobin levels in their third trimester of pregnancy were recruited at delivery. Information about the pregnancy outcome was then recorded for analysis. The primary outcome measure was neonatal gestational age adjusted birth weights. Results: No difference was found in the proportions of small for gestational age newborns between mothers with elevated haemoglobin and those with normal haemoglobin in the third trimester [9. 9 % 95 % CI (7. 4 to 13. 1) and 9. 7 % 95 % CI (6. 5 to 13. 8) respectively]. Similarly no difference was detected in the secondary outcomes of maternal hypertension, mode of delivery as well as other neonatal outcomes, though the study was not powered to detect differences in these outcomes. Conclusion: There is evidence of no association between elevated maternal haemoglobin in the third trimester and small for gestational age newborns in this study population...|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of these systems was in large part based upon a process was conducted using RAND's Delphi process. The results allowed for a collective recognition of the disparity and inconsistency in definitions and terminology a circumstance that {{was a surprise to}} many. The result of this process was a near unanimous decision to create a new set of descriptive and unambiguous terms that could be translated into a wide spectrum of languages. This process resulted in the first FIGO system; one that provided both definitions and nomenclature of normal and abnormal uterine bleeding using the 5th to 95% percentiles from the available large-scale epidemiological studies. Included in this set of definitions was the adoption of the term HMB - a symptom (not a diagnosis) - that was described by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence as “excessive <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss,</b> which interferes with a woman's physical, social, emotional and/or material quality of life”. These findings and recommendations were published simultaneously in 2007, in Fertility and Sterility and Human Reproduction.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system and oral me-droxyprogesterone acetate {{in the treatment of}} idiopathic heavy menstrual bleeding. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, controlled study, women aged 18 years or older with heavy men-strual bleeding (<b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> 80 mL or more per cycle) were randomly assigned to six cycles of treatment with either levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (10 mg daily for 10 days beginning on day 16 of each cycle). The primary efficacy variables were the absolute change in <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> from baseline to end of study and the propor-tion of women with successful treatment (defined as <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> less than 80 mL and a 50 % or greater reduction in <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> from baseline). RESULTS: Of 807 women screened, 165 were randomly assigned to treatment (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauter-ine system n 82, oral medroxyprogesterone acetate n 83). At the end of the study, the absolute reduction in median <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> was significantly greater in the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system group (128. 8 mL, range 393. 6 to 1242. 2 mL) than in the medroxyprogesterone acetate arm (17. 8 mL, range 271. 5 to 78. 6 mL, P <. 001), and the proportion of women with successful treatment was significantly higher for the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (84. 8 %) than for medroxyprogesterone acetate (22. 2 %, P <. 001). CONCLUSION: In women with idiopathic heavy men-strual bleeding, the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system reduces <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> more effectively and has a higher likelihood of treatment success than oral medroxyprogesterone acetate...|$|E

We also wanted {{to explore the}} extent to which clinicians pay attention to women's subjective accounts of ‘heavy’ <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> when making a diagnosis. The consequences of making a distinction between ‘normal’ and ‘abnormal’ blood loss may be considerable. A diagnosis of menorrhagia may crucially affect quality of life, morbidity and mortality.

Aims: The {{aim of the}} present study was to conduct an ethnomedicinal survey working with a Bagdi tribal healer of Rajbari District, Bangladesh. Settings and Design: The survey was carried out working with a Bagdi healer, who lived alone in the wetlands of Rajbari District and used primarily aquatic plants for treatment. Materials and Methods: Interview of the healer was carried out with the help of a semi-structured questionnaire and the guided field-walk method. Results: The Bagdi healer was observed to use seven different aquatic plant species coming from five plant families for treatment of ailments such as hemorrhoids, tonsillitis, heart disorders, burning sensations and pain in hands or legs, blurred vision, debility, sexual weakness in males, chronic dysentery, infertility in women, constipation, chronic leucorrhea, blackness and foul odor of <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood,</b> hair <b>loss,</b> graying of hair and to keep the head cool. One plant was used to treat what the healer mentioned as "evil eye", this refers to their belief in black-magic.

Objective: Evaluation {{of the effects of}} oral and rectal misoprostol in the treatment of excessive blood loss in cases of menorrhagia and comparison between both routes. Subjects and methods: Sixty patients with heavy, but however, regular periods (menorrhagia) were included in the study. They were randomly divided into two equal groups. Both groups were evaluated in two consecutive menstrual cycles. First without the treatment (baseline value) and the second cycle by either rectal misoprostol tablets (three times daily for the first 3 days of the bleeding) or by oral misoprostol tablets (one tablet three times daily for the first 3 days of the bleeding). For both the groups the estimated <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> was assessed before and after treatment using subjective and objective assessments. Results: A highly statistical significant reduction in <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> occurred by treatments in both groups (p= 0. 000). Rectal misoprostol produced the highest reduction in the <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> with a percent change of 53. 45 %, while oral misoprostol was less effective in reducing the <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> with a percent change of 36. 15 %. Both routes were effective in improving dysmenorrhea and reducing the number of cycle days with no significant differences between them. Conclusions: Both rectal and oral misoprostol are safe and effective routes for reducing excessive <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> (menorrhagia), but the rectal route is more effective...|$|E

Methods : A systematic review addressing the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the LNG-IUS for menorrhagia was undertaken. Results : Five controlled trials and five case series were found which measured <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss.</b> Nine studies recorded statistically significant average <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> reductions with LNG-IUS (range 74 %– 97 %). Another showed reduction in menstrual disturbance score. The LNG-IUS was more effective than tranexamic acid, but slightly less effective than endometrial resection at reducing <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss.</b> In one study, 64 % of women cancelled surgery at six months, compared with 14 % of control group women. In another, 82 % were taken off surgical waiting lists at one year. No cost effectiveness studies were found. Discussion : Small studies of moderate quality indicate the LNG-IUS is an effective treatment for menorrhagia. Costs may be less than for tranexamic acid in primary and secondary care. Although its use may reduce surgical waiting lists, cost effectiveness assessment requires longer follow up. Conclusion : Effectiveness and cost effectiveness relative to other treatments and the effect on surgical waiting lists can only be established in larger trials measuring patient-centred outcomes in women with menorrhagia. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the combined influence of diet, menstruation and genetic factors on iron status in Spanish menstruating women (n = 142).

Five selected SNPs were genotyped: rs 3811647, rs 1799852 (Tf gene); rs 1375515 (CACNA 2 D 3 gene); and rs 1800562 and rs 1799945 (HFE gene, mutations C 282 Y and H 63 D, respectively). Iron biomarkers were determined and cluster analysis was performed. Differences among clusters in dietary intake, <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> parameters and genotype frequencies distribution were studied. A categorical regression was performed to identify factors associated with cluster belonging. Three clusters were identified: women with poor iron status close to developing iron deficiency anemia (Cluster 1, n = 26); women with mild iron deficiency (Cluster 2, n = 59) and women with normal iron status (Cluster 3, n = 57).

40|$|Abstract Background Abnormal uterine {{bleeding}} {{is often}} investigated in clinical studies and critical to identify during gynecological consultation. The current standard for quantification of <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> is the alkaline-hematin-method. However, {{this method is}} expensive and inconvenient for patients. Bleeding diaries, although widely used, provide only qualitative information on <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss.</b> Other methods have been developed, but still do not provide reliable quantitative data. Methods We estimated blood loss volume using data from two clinical studies in women suffering abnormal menstrual bleeding. These estimations were derived from mixed linear models based on diary data, hematological parameters and age. To validate the models, we applied our results to data from a third study with a similar patient population. Results The resulting best fitting model uses diary entries on bleeding intensity at a particular day, information on occurrence and frequency of single bleeding intensities in defined time windows, hemoglobin and ferritin values and age of the patient all as predictors of <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> volume. Sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of excessive bleeding were 87 % and 70 %, respectively. Our model-based estimates reflect the subjective assessment by physicians and patients {{in the same way}} as the measured values do. When applying the model to an independent study, we found a correlation of 0. 73 between estimated and measured values for the blood loss in a single day. Further models with reduced number of parameters (simplified for easier practical use) still showed correlation values between 0. 69 and 0. 73. Conclusions We present a method for estimating <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> volume in women suffering from prolonged or excessive menstrual bleeding. Our statistical model includes entries from bleeding diaries, laboratory parameters and age and produces results which correlate well with data derived by the alkaline-hematin-method. Therefore, this model may be used to estimate <b>menstrual</b> <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> volume in both routine gynecological counseling and clinical studies. </p...|$|E
