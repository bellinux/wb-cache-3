5|$|A set of {{elements}} under two binary operations, + and −, {{is called a}} Euclidean domain if it forms a commutative ring R and, roughly speaking, if a generalized Euclidean algorithm can be performed on them. The two operations of such a ring need not be the addition and multiplication of ordinary arithmetic; rather, they can be more general, such as the operations of a mathematical group or <b>monoid.</b> Nevertheless, these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity.|$|E

Here, we show that the quasi-center of these <b>monoids</b> can be studied and described similarly, and then we exhibit the intersection between the two classes of <b>monoids...</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{families}} of atomic <b>monoids</b> whose arithmetical invariants {{have received a}} great deal of attention during the last two decades. In particular, the factorization theory of finitely generated <b>monoids,</b> Krull <b>monoids,</b> and C-monoids has been systematically studied. Puiseux <b>monoids,</b> which are additive submonoids consisting of nonnegative rational numbers, have only recently been investigated. In this paper, we provide evidence that this family comprises plenty of <b>monoids</b> with a basically unexplored atomic structure. We do this by showing that the arithmetical invariants of the well-studied atomic <b>monoids</b> mentioned earlier can almost never be transferred to Puiseux <b>monoids</b> via homomorphisms that preserve atomic configurations, i. e., transfer homomorphisms. As a result, we prove that most Puiseux <b>monoids</b> are neither Krull <b>monoids</b> nor C-monoids. Comment: 15 page...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe study <b>monoids</b> {{generated}} by certain Zariski–van Kampen generators in the 17 fundamental {{groups of the}} complement of logarithmic free divisors in C 3 listed by Sekiguchi. These <b>monoids</b> admit positive homogeneous presentations (Theorem 1). Five of them are Artin <b>monoids</b> and eight of them are free abelian <b>monoids.</b> The remaining four <b>monoids</b> are not Gaußian and, hence, are neither Garside nor Artin (Theorem 2). However, we introduce the concept of fundamental elements for positive homogeneously presented <b>monoids,</b> and we show that all 17 <b>monoids</b> possess fundamental elements (Theorem 3). As an application {{of the study of}} <b>monoids,</b> we solve some decision problems for the fundamental groups except in three cases...|$|R
25|$|Yet another {{definition}} is as a residuated lattice whose <b>monoid</b> operation is ∧. The <b>monoid</b> unit must then {{be the top}} element 1. Commutativity of this <b>monoid</b> implies that the two residuals coincide as a→b.|$|E
25|$|This is the {{analogue}} in <b>monoid</b> {{theory of}} a (left) group action. Right M-acts are defined {{in a similar}} way.

40|$|We {{describe}} irreducible representations {{and character}} formulas of the Renner <b>monoids</b> for reductive <b>monoids,</b> which generalizes the Munn-Solomon representation theory of rook <b>monoids</b> to any Renner <b>monoids.</b> The type map and polytope associated with reductive <b>monoids</b> {{play a crucial}} role in our work. It turns out that the irreducible representations of certain parabolic subgroups of the Weyl groups determine the complete set of irreducible representations of the Renner <b>monoids.</b> An analogue of the Munn-Solomon formula for calculating the character of the Renner <b>monoids,</b> in terms of the characters of the parabolic subgroups, is shown...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{construction}} of a wreath product of <b>monoids</b> with small categories is a generalization of wreath products of <b>monoids,</b> and of endomorphism <b>monoids</b> of free, projective, and even arbitrary acts over <b>monoids.</b> In this paper, we give a complete description of wreath products of <b>monoids</b> with small symmetric categories whose principal right (left) ideals from a tree with respect to inclusion. Such tree conditions are fulfilled by <b>monoids</b> whose (finitely generated) right (left) ideals are projective or injective. In particular, the characterization of (semi) hereditary endomorphism <b>monoids</b> of projective acts becomes a special case of the results obtained here...|$|R
40|$|In 2010, Everitt and Fountain {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} reflection <b>monoids.</b> The Boolean reflection <b>monoids</b> form a family of reflection <b>monoids</b> (symmetric inverse semigroups are Boolean reflection <b>monoids</b> of type $A$). In this paper, we give a family of presentations of Boolean reflection <b>monoids</b> and show how these presentations are compatible with mutations of certain quivers. A feature of the quivers in this paper corresponding to presentations of Boolean reflection <b>monoids</b> is that the quivers have frozen vertices. Our results recover the presentations of Boolean reflection <b>monoids</b> given by Everitt and Fountain and the presentations of symmetric inverse semigroups given by Popova. Surprisingly, inner by diagram automorphisms of irreducible Weyl groups or Boolean reflection <b>monoids</b> can be constructed by sequences of mutations preserving the same underlying diagrams. As an application, we study the cellularity of semigroup algebras of Boolean reflection <b>monoids</b> and construct new cellular bases of such cellular algebras using presentations we obtained and inner by diagram automorphisms of Boolean reflection <b>monoids.</b> Comment: 33 page...|$|R

25|$|A small {{category}} with {{a single}} object {{is the same thing}} as a monoid: the morphisms of a one-object category {{can be thought of as}} elements of the <b>monoid,</b> and composition in the category is thought of as the <b>monoid</b> operation.

The second part deals with the motivating examples of this class—the positive singular Artin <b>monoids.</b> Finally, the singular Artin <b>monoids</b> are introduced. The word and division problems are solved for all singular Artin <b>monoids</b> of finite type, including, for example, the singular braid <b>monoids</b> introduced by Baez and Birman...|$|R

25|$|Monoids may {{be given}} a presentation, much {{in the same way}} that groups can be {{specified}} by means of a group presentation. One does this by specifying a set of generators Σ, and a set of relations on the free <b>monoid</b> Σ∗.

40|$|A {{presentation}} by generators and relations is {{given for the}} <b>monoids</b> of endomorphisms in the simplicial category. These <b>monoids</b> are submonoids of <b>monoids</b> one finds in Temperley-Lieb algebras, and as the <b>monoids</b> of Temperley-Lieb algebras are linked to situations where an endofunctor is adjoint to itself, so the <b>monoids</b> of simplicial endomorphisms axiomatized here are linked to arbitrary adjoint situations.

25|$|The natural numbers form a <b>monoid</b> under addition. It {{turns out}} that this {{operation}} can be extended (in more than one way) to βN, turning this space also into a <b>monoid,</b> though rather surprisingly a non-commutative one.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the atomic {{structure}} {{of the family of}} Puiseux <b>monoids.</b> Puiseux <b>monoids</b> are a natural generalization of numerical semigroups, which have been actively studied since mid-nineteenth century.

Even more interesting is that there are many Puiseux <b>monoids</b> which are not even atomic. We delve into these situations, describing, in particular, a vast collection of commutative cancellative <b>monoids</b> containing no atoms. On the other hand, we find several characterization criteria which force Puiseux <b>monoids</b> to be atomic.

40|$|Our first main result {{shows that}} a graph product of right cancellative <b>monoids</b> is itself right cancellative. If each of the {{component}} <b>monoids</b> satisfies the condition that the intersection of two principal left ideals is either principal or empty, then so does the graph product. Our second main result gives a presentation for the inverse hull of such a graph product. We then specialise {{to the case of}} the inverse hulls of graph <b>monoids,</b> obtaining what we call polygraph <b>monoids.</b> Among other properties, we observe that polygraph <b>monoids</b> are F*-inverse.
