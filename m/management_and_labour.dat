25|$|The {{reasons for}} the CAW split from the UAW are complicated. Holmes and Rusonik (1990) contend that {{although}} the Canadian labour movement {{has been seen as}} traditionally more militant than its American counterpart, it was in fact the uneven geographical development of both <b>management</b> <b>and</b> <b>labour</b> led the Canadian auto-workers to develop a distinctly different set of collective bargaining objectives, which placed them in a far stronger bargaining position as compared to the UAW in the U.S., and, ultimately, brought about the events that led directly to the Split.|$|E
2500|$|A {{spokesman}} for the Canadian Taxpayers Federation has criticized the CAW's [...] "no-concession" [...] stance, saying that it only serves to strengthen the opposition to a taxpayer-funded bailout for the struggling Detroit Three automakers. The CTF further pointed out that [...] "It is especially difficult to understand anyone asking for government help that refuses {{to do anything to}} help itself to begin with", since they [...] "fail to realize they've existed at the substantial largesse of taxpayers for decades". Kelly McParland, a columnist for the National Post, has suggested that [...] "if he won't give anything, he and his members are likely to lose everything." [...] He also said that the problem facing the North American auto industry was borne equally by <b>management</b> <b>and</b> <b>labour</b> alike, criticizing labour for building up pay and benefits for themselves that was as unsustainable as it was enviable, while attacking management for its short-term strategy of selling gas-guzzling trucks and sales tactics (price cuts, rebates, free gas and cash-back schemes).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Japan has {{experienced}} high economic growth {{for most of}} the last forty-five years. In the early 1990 s the economy slowed, industrial production declined and unemployment increased. How have Japanese firms reacted to the changed economic circumstances? This is the question addressed by this paper. Using identical surveys administered in 1991 and 1995 the paper is able to show the changes in <b>management</b> practices <b>and</b> <b>labour</b> strategy over this four year period. The major finding of the research is that commitment to lifetime employment has declined both as a practice <b>and</b> in <b>management</b> s perception as a key determinant of productivity. The paper concludes by considering how far these changes represent a long-term trend or whether they are an opportunistic response to the cyclical nature of economic activity...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to {{showcase}} the symbiotic potency of an integrated Ergonomics and Design Research. The focus is to capture actionable insights for the design and evaluation of an Obstetric Body-Support System for physiologic childbirth. Such a system would be biomechanically efficient for the mother, in addition to improving the tasks of the birth attendants in the <b>management</b> of <b>labour</b> <b>and</b> ensuring the safety and well-being of the mother and her baby. The current medical model adopted for the <b>management</b> of <b>labour</b> <b>and</b> childbirth in hospitals is discussed to highlight current idiosyncratic procedures adopted in childbirth practices of modern obstetrics, and the challenges and opportunities for design improvement. An evidence-based transdisciplinary method is detailed through a case study to demonstrate how ergonomics research is applied to elicit empirical anatomical, physiological, psychological and behavioural knowledge, to inform the designer with evidence and insight for problem framing, new concept visualization, prototyping, and system evaluation in hospital settings. ‘Ergodesign’, a hybrid paradigm to humanise <b>labour</b> <b>and</b> childbirth, is proposed as a design science to improve current obstetric practices.

However, the literature caters little for the recent rise of employees taking to social networking sites (SNSs), such as Facebook, {{to find ways to}} cope with the pressures of contemporary employment. To explore the self-organised coping qualities of SNSs, interviews were conducted with front line workers, employed by a large anti-trade union US retailer, who contribute to a self-organised Facebook group set up as a place for fellow employees to deal with collective employment-related problems. The main findings suggest employee self-organised Facebook groups represent an important development and extension to the coping practices available to individual and groups of employees. The main implication of the findings is that Facebook groups appear to strengthen and widen the options for employee resilience in an age of continuing trade union retreat...|$|R
5000|$|Between 1911 and 1918, a {{succession}} of laws was promulgated in South Africa which dealt with various industrial sectors, <b>and</b> with <b>labour</b> in general. Only {{in the aftermath of}} large-scale industrial unrest on the Witwatersrand in 1922, however, was any comprehensive attempt undertaken to regulate relations between <b>management</b> <b>and</b> organised <b>labour.</b> The tumult on the Rand led directly to the first comprehensive piece of labour legislation, the Industrial Conciliation Act 1924, which was also the first legislation to regulate strikes in the country. It also recognised and regulated lock-outs. The Act provided for the registration of white trade unions and employers’ organisations, [...] "self-evidently also white," [...] and established a framework for collective bargaining through industrial councils or conciliation boards, as well as a dispute settlement system. Although the Act was [...] "largely voluntarist," [...] compliance with its provisions and with collective agreements was enforced by criminal sanction. The 1924 Act resulted in greater wage disparity between different racial groups. The Industrial Conciliation Act dealt only with collective labour rights; individual rights were dealt with in a Wage Act in 1925.|$|R
