5|$|Toxemia of {{pregnancy}} is common and kills many pregnant females. Signs of toxemia include anorexia, lack of energy, excessive salivation, a sweet or fruity breath odor due to ketones, and seizures in advanced cases. Pregnancy toxemia {{appears to be}} most common in hot climates. Other serious complications {{of pregnancy}} can include a prolapsed uterus, hypocalcaemia, and <b>mastitis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Underwire bras are {{occasionally}} {{linked to}} health conditions including breast pain, <b>mastitis,</b> and metal allergies. Women wearing an underwire bra {{have in a}} few rare instances been subjected to extra scrutiny when their bra set off metal detectors at security checkpoints in airports or prisons. There {{have been a few}} recorded incidents where the underwire deflected a bullet or other weapon that struck the woman's chest.|$|E
5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, <b>mastitis,</b> salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
5|$|Most E. coli strains do {{not cause}} disease, but virulent strains can cause gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, {{neonatal}} meningitis, hemorrhagic colitis, and Crohn's disease. Common {{signs and symptoms}} include severe abdominal cramps, diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, vomiting, and sometimes fever. In rarer cases, virulent strains are also responsible for bowel necrosis (tissue death) and perforation without progressing to hemolytic-uremic syndrome, peritonitis, <b>mastitis,</b> septicemia, and Gram-negative pneumonia. Very young children {{are more susceptible to}} develop severe illness, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome, however, healthy individuals of all ages are at risk to the severe consequences that may arise as a result of being infected with E. coli.|$|E
25|$|In {{veterinary}} medicine, it is a well-recognized {{cause of}} bovine <b>mastitis,</b> {{hence the name}} dys-galactiae. In some geographic regions, it is reported only second to Staphylococcus aureus {{as a cause of}} both clinical and subclinical <b>mastitis.</b> S. dysgalactiae has been particularly linked to <b>mastitis</b> occurring during the summer time (“Summer mastitis”), and bacterial spreading by flying insects has been suggested. <b>Mastitis</b> in other animals has also been documented.|$|E
25|$|Cows {{receiving}} rBGH supplements may {{more frequently}} contract an udder infection known as <b>mastitis.</b> Problems with <b>mastitis</b> {{have led to}} Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan banning milk from rBST treated cows. <b>Mastitis,</b> among other diseases, {{may be responsible for}} the fact that levels of white blood cells in milk vary naturally.|$|E
25|$|Milk fat {{percentages}} may {{be manipulated}} by dairy farmers' stock diet formulation strategies. <b>Mastitis</b> infection can cause fat levels to decline.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mastitis</b> is an {{inflammation}} of the breast. It causes local pain (dolor), redness (rubor), swelling (tumor), and warmth (calor). Later stages of <b>mastitis</b> cause symptoms of systemic infection like fever and nausea. It mostly occurs 2–3 weeks after delivery but can happen at any time. Typically results from milk stasis with primary or secondary local, later systemic infection. Infectious organisms include Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp. and E. coli. Continued breastfeeding, plenty of rest and adequate fluid supply is the best treatment for light cases.|$|E
25|$|In humans : gastroenteritis, {{urinary tract}} infections, and {{neonatal}} meningitis. In rarer cases, virulent strains are {{also responsible for}} hemolytic-uremic syndrome, peritonitis, <b>mastitis,</b> septicaemia and gram-negative pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Research has incriminated Hydrotaea irritans as a vector {{of summer}} <b>mastitis,</b> a bovine {{infection}} {{that can be}} caused by multiple suspected bacteria. The research allowed flies inoculated with select bacteria from a sample representing summer <b>mastitis</b> to come in contact with the udders of cattle. The bacteria appeared in some of the cows and on the bodies of just over a third of the doctored flies. The evidence indicates that H. irritans transmits the bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Peptostreptococcus indolicus, and Fusobacterium necrophorum.|$|E
25|$|S. aureus {{is one of}} {{the causal}} agents of <b>mastitis</b> in dairy cows. Its large {{polysaccharide}} capsule protects the organism from recognition by the cow's immune defenses.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} many {{studies suggest that}} cows with SCC of less than 200,000 {{are not likely to}} be {{infected}} with major <b>mastitis</b> pathogens, but cows with SCC above 300,000 are probably infected (Smith, 1996).|$|E
25|$|Toxic shock {{syndrome}} (TSS) {{is a condition}} caused by bacterial toxins. Symptoms may include fever, rash, skin peeling, and low blood pressure. There may also be symptoms related to the specific underlying infection such as <b>mastitis,</b> osteomyelitis, necrotising fasciitis, or pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Every time a cow {{enters the}} parlor several {{things need to}} happen to ensure milk quality and cow health. First, the cow’s udder must be cleaned and {{disinfected}} to prevent both milk contamination and udder infections. Then the milking technician must check each teat for signs of infection by observing the first stream of milk. During this processes, called stripping the teat, the milking technician is looking for any discoloration or chunkiness that would indicate <b>mastitis,</b> an infection in the cow’s mammary gland. Milk from a cow with <b>mastitis</b> cannot enter the human milk supply, thus farmers must be careful that infected milk does not mix with the milk from healthy cows and that the cow gets the necessary treatment. If the cow passes the <b>mastitis</b> inspection, the milking technician will attach the milking cluster. The cluster will run until the cow is fully milked and then drop off. The milk travels immediately through a cooling system and then into a large cooled storage tank, where it will stay until {{picked up by a}} refrigerated milk truck. Before the cow is released from the milking stalls her teats are disinfected one last time to prevent infection.|$|E
25|$|The {{names are}} derived from Greek; Streptococcus meaning chain forming (Streptos) rounded berry-like bodies (kokkos), {{referring}} to their usual appearance under a light-microscope. Dys (bad) galactiae (milk) alludes to their propensity to cause bovine <b>mastitis.</b> Equi (horse) similis (like) infers similarity to the closely related species, Streptococcus equi.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the danger}} of {{infection}} to humans, it is important to maintain the health of milk-producing cattle. Common ailments affecting dairy cows include infectious disease (e.g. <b>mastitis,</b> endometritis and digital dermatitis), metabolic disease (e.g. milk fever and ketosis) and injuries caused by their environment (e.g. hoof and hock lesions).|$|E
25|$|In animals, virulent {{strains of}} E. coli are {{responsible}} {{of a variety}} of diseases, among others septicemia and diarrhea in newborn calves, acute <b>mastitis</b> in dairy cows, colibacillosis also associated with chronic respiratory disease with Mycoplasma where it causes perihepatitis, pericarditis, septicaemic lungs, peritonitis etc. in poultry, and Alabama rot in dogs.|$|E
25|$|Radiation {{treatments}} {{may interfere}} with the mother's ability to breastfeed her baby because it reduces the ability of that breast to produce milk and {{increases the risk of}} <b>mastitis.</b> Also, when chemotherapy is being given after birth, many of the drugs pass through breast milk to the baby, which could harm the baby.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mastitis</b> {{frequently}} {{interferes with}} milk production. Its incidence {{appears to be}} unusually high among Rashaida camels. Most often it occurs in animals whose offspring have died, {{so it may be}} attributable to insufficient milking. Köhler-Rollefson, Musa and Fadl Achmed, 1991). Among the most common diseases affecting livestock are trypanosomiasis (ghuffar), mange (jerab), pneumonia (haboob), camel pox (ghedderi), contagious skin necrosis (na'aita) and ringworm (ghoob) and Western medication is rarely available to treat them.|$|E
25|$|Most {{symptoms}} of breast disorders, including most lumps, do not {{turn out to}} represent underlying breast cancer. Fewer than 20% of lumps, for example, are cancerous, and benign breast diseases such as <b>mastitis</b> and fibroadenoma of the breast are more common causes of breast disorder symptoms. Nevertheless, {{the appearance of a}} new symptom should be taken seriously by both patients and their doctors, because of the possibility of an underlying breast cancer at almost any age.|$|E
25|$|The breast is {{susceptible}} to numerous benign and malignant conditions. The most frequent benign conditions are puerperal <b>mastitis,</b> fibrocystic breast changes and mastalgia. Lactation unrelated to pregnancy can occur as galactorrhea (spontaneous milk flow) from the adverse effects of drugs (e.g. antipsychotic medications), extreme physical stress, or endocrine disorders. In a newborn infant, the capability of lactation {{is a consequence of}} the mother's circulating hormones (prolactin, oxytocin, etc.) in his or her blood stream, which were introduced by the shared circulatory system of the placenta.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditionally}} accepted {{identification of}} the model is of Rembrandt's partner Hendrickje Stoffels, {{who would have been}} 28 {{at the time of the}} painting. Sluijter has proposed otherwise, stating that the likeness is of an ideal type used by Rembrandt over a long period. Assuming Stoffels as the model, medical researchers have observed deformity in the left breast, and have offered various hypotheses including breast cancer, abscess due to tuberculosis and lactation <b>mastitis</b> following an unsuccessful pregnancy. The diagnosis of breast cancer is unlikely, given that Stoffels lived for another nine years.|$|E
25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae is a gram positive, beta-haemolytic, coccal {{bacterium}} {{belonging to}} the family Streptococcaceae. It is capable of infecting both humans and animals, but is most frequently encountered as a commensal of the alimentary tract, genital tract, or less commonly, {{as a part of}} the skin flora. The clinical manifestations in human disease range from superficial skin-infections and tonsillitis, to severe necrotising fasciitis and bacteraemia. The incidence of invasive disease has been reported to be rising. Several different animal species are susceptible to infection by S.dysgalactiae, but bovine <b>mastitis</b> and infectious arthritis in lambs (joint ill) have been most frequently reported.|$|E
25|$|Warts {{caused by}} the Xipapillomavirus group have a cauliflower-like {{appearance}} and can attain {{the size of a}} fist; most common on the head, neck and shoulders, they may also occur in other locations. Cutaneous fibropapillomas caused by Deltapapillomavirus group have a nodular appearance. Although unsightly, most skin warts rarely cause problems except in show animals. However, large warts may bleed, potentially leading to secondary infections, and florid warts of the teat can cause <b>mastitis</b> and interfere with suckling and milking. Fibropapillomas can be troublesome when present in the genital area, causing pain and sometimes loss of reproductive functions as well as interfering with calving. Chronically immunosuppressed animals may develop extensive papillomatosis in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which can cause difficulties with eating and breathing.|$|E
25|$|When larvae of Lucilia feed parasitically {{they cause}} the disease facultative myiasis (facultative = {{opportunistic}} or optional). When this occurs on sheep {{it is often}} known as blow-fly strike. This causes severe distress to the host and may be fatal due to toxemia from ammonia excreted by masses of infesting larvae. Females of Chrysomya, Cochliomyia and Wohlfahrtia and similar genera always seek out their host such as cattle, sheep, dogs, to lay their eggs at vulnerable sites such as a small wound. The larvae hatch and rapidly invade the superficial layers of skin to continue feeding there until ready to pupate. This form of parasitism is essential for these types of fly, and causes obligate myiasis (obligate = necessary or essential). This infestation develops into severe disease and can be fatal if the infestation is at a vulnerable site such as ear or navel of the host. Adult blow-flies {{such as those in}} the Calliphora genus can be significant as transmitters of various bacteria involved in <b>mastitis</b> of cattle. The conjunctivitis of cattle known as pink-eye is caused by Moraxella bovis bacteria and may be transmitted by blow-flies.|$|E
500|$|Trauma or illness {{may also}} {{result in a}} cow unable to rise to its feet. [...] Such animals are {{sometimes}} called [...] "downers." [...] Sometimes this {{occurs as a result}} of muscle and nerve damage from calving or a disease such as <b>mastitis.</b> [...] Leg injuries, muscle tears, or a massive infection of some sort may also be causes. Downer cows are encouraged to get to their feet and have a much greater chance of recovery if they do. If unable to rise, some have survived—with medical care—as long as 14 days and were ultimately able to get back on their feet. Appropriate medical treatment for a downer cow to prevent further injury includes rolling {{from one side to the}} other every three hours, careful and frequent feeding of small amounts of fodder, and access to clean water.|$|E
500|$|In 1930, Warren {{became an}} Associate Professor of Medicine. That year he {{published}} [...] "A Roentgenologic Study of the Breast". X-ray imaging {{of the breast}} had first been investigated by Albert Salomon at the University of Berlin in 1913. He produced images of over 3,000 mastectomy specimens, and observed different forms and stages of cancer. He was even able to detect an undiagnosed cancer in a breast that had been removed because of a large cyst. However, Salomon apparently did not appreciate the life saving potential of his observations. Warren used radiology to track changes in breast tissue {{as a result of}} pregnancy and <b>mastitis.</b> He developed a stereoscopic technique, using patients rather than specimens and adapting general purpose X-ray equipment to his needs. His method involved having the patient lie on her side with one arm raised while being X-rayed. In 119 women who subsequently underwent surgery, he correctly found breast cancer in 54 out of 58 cases. This represented a leap forward, as it made diagnosis of breast cancer possible without surgery. It also sparked intense interest in the technique around the world. Today mammography saves thousands of lives.|$|E
2500|$|Herds with {{bulk tank}} SCC above 200,000 will have {{varying degrees of}} {{subclinical}} <b>mastitis</b> present. Data from the National <b>Mastitis</b> Council (1987) show that 6% of the [...] quarters in a herd {{could be expected to}} be infected in a herd with a bulk tank SCC of 200,000.|$|E

2500|$|Certain Hydrotaea {{species have}} been proven to carry and {{transmit}} certain diseases to warm blooded animals, including humans. Researchers continue to monitor these vectors of disease {{as they have been}} connected with the spread of <b>mastitis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Soft masses such as {{milk and}} bread, onion and cornmeal, cow dung, pancakes, or potato {{scrapings}} {{were used to}} treat <b>mastitis.</b> [...] A cloth soaked in camphor was applied to engorged breasts to draw out milk.|$|E
2500|$|Irritation {{is caused}} by large numbers of Musca house-flies, through to severe biting stress from dense populations of Stomoxys or Haematobia flies. Musca house-flies, face-flies, and similar types {{transmit}} a variety of bacteria involved in <b>mastitis</b> of cattle. The conjunctivitis of cattle known as pink-eye {{is caused by}} Moraxella bovis bacteria transmitted by Musca autumnalis face-flies. The feeding of various Musca species of fly permits the contaminative transmission of nematode worms, for example Parafilaria bovicola, causing a nodular filariasis in cattle. Stomoxys species transmit several species of Trypanosoma protozoa to cattle, sheep and goats causing various types of trypanosomiasis. [...] Haematobia horn-flies transmit nematode worms in the genus Stephanofilaria to the skin of cattle, causing stephanofilariasis, a suppurating dermatitis known as hump sore. Stomoxys flies transmit the bacterium Eperythrozoon ovis to sheep and this infection may lead to fever and anemia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effect of}} {{overstocking}} in cows {{can have a}} negative effect on milk production and reproduction rates which are two very important traits for dairy farmers. Overcrowding of cows in barns has been found to reduced feeding, resting and rumination. Although they consume the same amount of dry matter within the span of a day, they consume the food at a much more rapid rate, and this behaviour in cows can lead to further complications. The feeding behaviour of cows during their post-milking period is very important as it has been proven that the longer animals can eat after milking, the longer they will be standing up and therefore causing less contamination to the teat ends. This is necessary to reduce the risk of <b>mastitis</b> as infection has been shown to increase the chances of embryonic loss. Sufficient rest is important for dairy cows because it is during this period that their resting blood flow increases up to 50%, this is directly proportionate to milk production. Each additional hour of rest can be seen to translate to 2 to 3.5 more pounds of milk per cow daily. Stocking densities of anything over 120% have been shown to decrease the amount of time cows spend lying down.. Accessed 16 Nov 2016 ...|$|E
50|$|Periductal <b>mastitis,</b> comedo <b>mastitis,</b> {{secretory}} {{disease of}} the breast, plasma cell <b>mastitis</b> and <b>mastitis</b> obliterans are sometimes considered special cases or synonyms of duct ectasia syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is called}} [...] <b>mastitis</b> (or {{lactation}} <b>mastitis</b> or lactational <b>mastitis)</b> when {{it occurs in}} lactating mothers and non-puerperal (or nonlactational) otherwise. <b>Mastitis</b> can, in rare cases, occur in men. Inflammatory breast cancer has symptoms very similar to <b>mastitis</b> and must be ruled out.|$|E
50|$|Granulomatous <b>mastitis</b> can {{be divided}} into {{idiopathic}} granulomatous <b>mastitis</b> (also known as granular lobular <b>mastitis)</b> and granulomatous <b>mastitis</b> occurring as a rare secondary complication of a great variety of other conditions such as tuberculosis and other infections, sarcoidosis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Special forms of granulomatous <b>mastitis</b> occur as complication of diabetes. Some cases are due to silicone injection (Silicone-induced granulomatous inflammation) or other foreign body reactions.|$|E
