Several essential oils consisting mostly of anethole have insecticidal action against larvae of the mosquitos Ochlerotatus caspius and Aedes aegypti. [...] In a similar manner, anethole itself is effective against the fungus gnat Lycoriella ingenua (Sciaridae) and the <b>mold</b> <b>mite</b> Tyrophagus putrescentiae. [...] Against the mite, anethole is a slightly more effective pesticide than DEET, but anisaldehyde, a related natural compound that occurs with anethole in many essential oils, is 14 times more effective. [...] The insecticidal action of anethole is greater as a fumigant than as a contact agent. (E)-anethole is highly effective as a fumigant against the cockroach Blattella germanica and against adults of the weevils Sitophilus oryzae, Callosobruchus chinensis and beetle Lasioderma serricorne.|$|E

This study determined {{the effects of}} relative humidity on mold mites (Tyrophagus putrescentiae) with regard to acaricide efficacy and dispersal characteristics. The <b>mold</b> <b>mite</b> is a stored product pest that can infest retail habitats. <b>Mold</b> <b>mite</b> survival depends on relative humidity (RH), and RH levels may affect efficacy of residual acaricides. In a simulated retail habitat, increasing humidity levels generally decreased acaricide efficacy. Results indicated that some acaricides may create a barrier against this mite. A second study analyzed <b>mold</b> <b>mite</b> dispersal characteristics. Mite infestations may remain undetected until mites leave the food package. Arenas provided an enclosed food reservoir incubated at high RH, and an open space incubated at one of three RH levels.

40|$|Background: Cow {{hair and}} dander are {{important}} inducers of occupational allergies in cattle-exposed farmers. To estimate allergen exposure in farming environments, a sensitive enzyme immunoassay {{was developed to}} measure cow hair allergens. Methods: A sandwich ELISA was developed using polyclonal rabbit antibodies against a mixture of hair extracts from different cattle breeds. To assess the specificity of the assay, extracts from other mammalian epithelia, <b>mites,</b> <b>molds</b> and grains were tested. To validate the new assay, cow hair allergens were measured in passive airborne dust samples from the stables and homes of farmers. Dust was collected with electrostatic dust fall collectors (EDCs). Results: The sandwich ELISA {{was found to be}} very sensitive (detection limit: 0. 1 ng/ml) and highly reproducible, demonstrating intra-and interassay coefficients of variation of 4 and 10 %, respectively. The assay showed no reactivity with <b>mites,</b> <b>molds</b> and grains, but some cross-reactivity with other mammalian epithelia, with the strongest reaction with goat. Using EDCs for dust sampling, high concentrations of bovine allergens were measured in cow stables (4, 760 - 559, 400 mu g/m(2)). In addition, bovine allergens were detected in all areas of cattle farmer dwellings. A large variation was found between individual samples (0. 3 - 900 mu g/m(2)) and significantly higher values were discovered in changing rooms. Conclusion: The ELISA developed for the detection of cow hair proteins is a useful tool for allergen quantification in occupational and home environments. Based on its low detection limit, this test is sensitive enough to detect allergens in passive airborne dust. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|R

30|$|In {{building}} environments, {{water vapor}} condensation happens wherever exposed building surfaces {{are at a}} lower temperature than the dew point. Typically, {{it is not easy}} to detect small amounts of the condensed water on building surfaces with the naked eye. Failure in detecting the onset of such condensation issues causes the condensed moisture to accumulate over time. Then, <b>molds</b> and dust <b>mites</b> may build up, which ultimately has potential for causing allergic reactions among the building occupants. In addition, the resulting wet surface may cause flaking paints and peeling wallpapers. This is when the building occupants are more likely to detect the problems with their naked eyes. In building environments, windowsills or thermal bridges around corners of the walls typically have low temperatures. Thus, energy auditors need to proactively analyze these areas whether the surface temperature has reached to the dew point.|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of allergen molecules (‘components’) from several protein families has advanced {{our understanding of}} immunoglobulin E (IgE) -mediated responses and enabled ‘component-resolved diagnosis’ (CRD). The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Molecular Allergology User's Guide (MAUG) provides comprehensive information on important allergens and describes the diagnostic options using CRD. Part A of the EAACI MAUG introduces allergen molecules, families, composition of extracts, databases, and diagnostic IgE, skin, and basophil tests. Singleplex and multiplex IgE assays with components improve both sensitivity for low-abundance allergens and analytical specificity; IgE to individual allergens can yield information on clinical risks and distinguish cross-reactivity from true primary sensitization. Part B discusses the clinical and molecular aspects of IgE-mediated allergies to foods (including nuts, seeds, legumes, fruits, vegetables, cereal grains, milk, egg, meat, fish, and shellfish), inhalants (pollen, <b>mold</b> spores, <b>mites,</b> and animal dander), and Hymenoptera venom. Diagnostic algorithms and short case histories provide useful information for the clinical workup of allergic individuals targeted for CRD. Part C covers protein families containing ubiquitous, highly cross-reactive panallergens from plant (lipid transfer proteins, polcalcins, PR- 10, profilins) and animal sources (lipocalins, parvalbumins, serum albumins, tropomyosins) and explains their diagnostic and clinical utility. Part D lists 100 important allergen molecules. In conclusion, IgE-mediated reactions and allergic diseases, including allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, food reactions, and insect sting reactions, are discussed from a novel molecular perspective.

Self screening questionnaires for {{indoor air pollution}} (IAP) exist but none has been validated. We have built a self-administered questionnaire for screening IAP in asthmatic children {{using data from the}} literature and existing questionnaires unvalidated self. Aim: The goal is to validate the self-administered questionnaire items, this is the main objective. The second is to show an association between sources of pollution or contaminants from the air of the home and the degree of asthma. Method: First of all, we asked general practitioners in Vienne and in Charente Maritime for the recruitment of asthmatic children seen in primary care. Self IAP questionnaire was filled by the child s parents. Then second of all, a survey of asthmatic children s homes was completed. Observations and samples of indoor air pollutants (VOCs, <b>mold,</b> dust <b>mites,</b> particles, temperature, humidity) were performed to verify the consistency of responses to the self-administered questionnaire. Results: On the one hand, 9 items self questionnaire IAP within the house in a population of 50 asthmatic children seen in primary care have been statistically validated. On the other hand, the lack of means of aeration in the kitchen is associated only with children whose severity stage is level 2 and 3. A link between chlorine and within groups 2 and 3 levels was found. Several VOCs in the indoor air of within the house including chlorine, propanal, chloroform, were measured at high rates at least 50 % of dwellings, see about 90 % for chlorine. Conclusion: This study has validated the items of the self-administered questionnaire. It remains to be confirmed with a larger sample observations in our study namely the association found between levels of asthma more severe and the presence of chlorine in indoor air at hight rates and the absence of aeration in the kitchen.

5000|$|Important to the {{understanding}} of migrant community health is the increasingly stratified American society, manifested in residential segregation. Beginning in the 1970s, the low to moderate levels of income segregation in the United States began to degrade. [...] As the rich became richer, so did their neighborhoods. This trend was inversely reflected in the poor, as their neighborhoods became poorer. As sociologist Douglas Massey explains, “As a result, poverty and affluence both became more concentrated geographically.” Professor of public administration and economics John Yinger writes that “one way for poor people to win the spatial competition for housing is to rent small or low-quality housing.” However, he continues, low-quality housing often features serious health risks such as lead paint and animal pests. Though lead-based paint was deemed illegal in 1978, it remains on the walls of older apartments and houses, posing a serious neurological risk to children. Asthma, a possible serious health risk, also has a clear link to poverty. Moreover, asthma attacks have been associated with certain aspects of poor housing quality such as the presence of cockroaches, mice, dust, dust <b>mites,</b> <b>mold,</b> and mildew. The 1997 American Housing Survey found that signs of rats or mice are almost twice as likely to be detected in poor households as in non-poor households.|$|R

40|$|Asthma is {{a chronic}} lung disease {{characterized}} by recurrent and intermittent episodes or attacks {{in which the}} linings of the airways swell, mucus blocks the airways, and the muscles around the airways tighten. During an episode, people with asthma experience tightness in the chest, difficulty breathing, wheezing, and coughing. Asthma symptoms occur when exposed to certain triggers such as pet dander, <b>mold,</b> dust <b>mites,</b> tobacco smoke, or wood smoke. Asthma symptoms can be controlled through appropriate use of medications and avoidance of identified triggers. However, poor management of the disease can lead to complications that result in poor health, hospitalization, and even death.

We describe the implementation of the Seattle-King County Healthy Homes Project, a randomized, controlled trial of an outreach/education intervention to improve asthma-related health status by reducing exposure to allergens and irritants in the home. We randomly assigned 274 low-income children with asthma ages 4 - 12 to either a high- or a low-intensity group. In the high-intensity group, community health workers called Community Home Environmental Specialists (CHES) conducted initial home environmental assessments, provided individualized action plans, and made additional visits over a 12 -month period to provide education and social support, encouragement of participant actions, provision of materials to reduce exposures (including bedding encasements), assistance with roach and rodent eradication, and advocacy for improved housing conditions.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of sulfite intolerance are unknown. It {{has been suggested}} that, in some cases, it {{could be due to}} a partial sulfite-oxidase deficiency. In these patients, this enzyme is unable to metabolize adequately an overload of ingested or inhaled exogenous sulfite, triggering a bronch-ospasm. Cyanocobalamin is able to catalyze the extracellu-lar oxidation of sulfites, preventing sulfite accumulation and the subsequent symptoms due to this excess. Methods A 36 y. o. woman was attended at our allergy Clinic after suffering repeated anaphylactic episodes and an anaphylac-tic shock, 60 minutes after eating different foods. The aller-gic study confirmed sensitization to pollens, animal dander, dust <b>mites,</b> <b>molds</b> and PR- 10 proteins (ImmunoCAP Isac, Thermofisher, Sweden). We performed a double-blind placebo controlled challenge (DBPCC) with sulfites. She reacted with 50 mg of metabisulfite with facial flushing, rhinitis and bronchospasm (FEV 1 decrease> 20 %). We recommended a sulfite avoidance diet, but two months later she came back complaining of great difficulty to avoid sulfite given the ubiquity of this additive in nearly all foods. We performed another sulfite challenge with cyanoco-balamin pretreatment. Results We pre-treated the patient with 4 mcg of cyanocobalamin 1 hour before repeating de sulfite challenge. We increased the sulfite dose every 20 minutes, from 5 mg to 200 mg. The challenge test was negative. We recommended the patient to take every day 4 mcg of cyanocobalamin in order to prevent anaphylactic reactions from inadvertent exposure to sulfites and to continue with a sulfite avoidance diet. Since then, she has been stable, without asthma exacerbation or anaphylactic reactions.

40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of fresh cheeses {{one of the main}} drawbacks is the mold proliferation {{on the surface of the}} product. Therefore, the use of chemical agents with antimicrobial activity is almost mandatory. However, the industry’s interest is oriented toward alternatives preferably in line with consumers expectations for food products with a short list of ingredients. In this study, the antimicrobial efficacy of ozone against molds and yeasts that contaminate the rooms of fresh cheese maturation has been tested. The experiment was conducted using 2 adjacent rooms with a volume of 360 m 3 each. Five successive batches of cheese obtained in as many days were considered for experimental purposes. At the end of the salting phase (in brine for 48 h) the cheeses of each batch were equally split between the 2 rooms. The cheeses were settled on plastic shelves located in the opposite side of the door. In one room were placed 4 ozone generators (2 near the door and 2 in the opposite side) operating according to corona discharge with a production capacity of 5 g ozone/h each one. The emission of ozone was continued for 28 consecutive days from 6 : 00 pm to 4 : 00 am. The microbial samples were taken by scrubbing 100 cm 2 surface area both for shelves (accurately sanitized before the beginning of the trial) and for cheese. The scrubs were collected the day after the cheese manufacture, at the end of first, second, third and fourth week of maturing. In all cases the collections were taken at 8 : 00 am. At the fourth week, microbial analysis was also conducted on 25 g of crust cheese removed for a thickness of about 2 mm. The molds and yeasts cells collected were submitted to grown on DRBCA AGAR BASE and OGYE AGAR BASE at 25 ° C for 5 days. The scrubs coming from the room used as control showed molds charges that were in the order of magnitude of 1 log in the first sampling time rising up to 3 - 4 logs after 28 days both for shelves and cheeses. The yeasts showed more variable values in the first sampling time (from 1 to 3 logs) and higher values at the end of the experiment (up to 5 logs). In the room submitted to ozone treatment the microbial behavior was completely different. The molds were almost absent from all the surfaces tested already at the end of the first week of maturing time and this situation persisted until the end. The yeasts showed a linear decrease until disappearing at the end of the third week. In conclusion, the employment of ozone in gaseous form seems to be able to eliminate molds and yeasts both from shelves surface and from the crust of fresh cheeses. That of ozone is a technology relatively easy to use that leaving no residual is also environmental friendly. It was defined as GRAS by the US-FDA and employed as direct food additive. In Italy the Ministry of Health in 1996 recognized the ozone for the treatment of water and air as a tool for the sterilization of confined environments contaminated by viruses, bacteria, spores, <b>molds</b> and <b>mites...</b>|$|R

Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 39 chronic allergic rhinitis patients (males 24, females 15), aged 20 - 70 (mean age 36. 33 ± 2. 03) years and 53 individuals (36 males, 17 females); aged 24 to 64 (mean age 45. 42 ± 1. 36) years. Duration of allergic rhinitis was 1. 77 ± 0. 237 years. In the study group, nasal symptoms were scored and the results were recorded. The patients were classified as having perennial Allergic rhinitis (PAR) if they had had at least 2 rhinitis symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, itching) for at least 6 months a year in the previous 2 years and if they had a positive skin prick test response to at least 1 clinically significant perennial allergen (e. g., house dust <b>mites,</b> <b>molds,</b> cockroach, cockroach excrement grass and tree pollen, cat and dog epithelia and molds, or animal dander). They had no other allergic diseases except persistent allergic rhinitis diagnosed by the physical and history examination. Erythrocyte lipid peroxidation, erythrocyte antioxidants viz., glutathione, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase, catalase and plasma antioxidants viz., ceruloplasmin, glutathione-S-transferase, vitamin C, total antioxidant activity were estimated in the above two groups. Results: Erythrocyte lipid peroxidation (0 hour, p < 0. 01) and superoxide dismutase (p < 0. 01) were significantly higher, whereas plasma vitamin C (p < 0. 001), ceruloplasmin (p < 0. 05) and total antioxidant activity (p < 0. 001) were significantly lower in chronic allergic rhinitis patients when compared to controls. Plasma Glutathione S transferase and erythrocyte catalase, glutathione, and glutathione reductase remained unchanged from normal subjects. Conclusion: The changes in different parameters indicate an imbalance in the oxidant and antioxidant status in chronic allergic rhinitis patients. Further studies are required to investigate the potential for antioxidant supplements to be used as routine therapy in chronic allergic rhinitis patients. Capsule summery: The study shows that the body is trying to cope for the oxidative stress by altering the enzyme levels. But external supplement may also be required as the total antioxidant levels are very much depleted...|$|R

As medidas de controle {{ambiental}} estão entre as várias ações terapêuticas, e buscam reduzir a exposição aos alérgenos. OBJETIVO: Verificar a prevalência de controle ambiental adequado em uma população atendida pelo programa de saúde da família e a possível associação com exacerbações de asma em crianças e adolescentes na faixa etária de 5 a 14 anos no município de Camaragibe (PE). MÉTODO: Estudo transversal com 210 mães/responsáveis por crianças/adolescentes em que se aplicaram os formulários do International Study of Asthma and allergies {{in children}} para caracterizar a exacerbação das crises de asma, e em que se utilizou o Guia de Avaliação Ambiental do Alérgico na observação direta do quarto e da sala das residências. RESULTADOS: Entre as 210 crianças/adolescentes que apresentaram asma em 2001, foi observado controle ambiental adequado em 141 casos (67, 1 %), não havendo associação entre o grau de controle ambiental e menor freqüência (BACKGROUND: Hypersensitivity to dust <b>mites,</b> <b>mold</b> and pet dander {{found in the}} home is common among patients with asthma. Home environmental control to reduce exposure to allergens is one of various therapeutic measures that can be taken. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of adequate home environmental control among a study population monitored by the Family Health Program and to identify any possible correlation with the exacerbation of asthma among {{children between the ages}} of 5 and 14 in the city of Camaragibe, located in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. METHOD: A transversal study was carried out involving 210 mothers/guardians of children, to whom International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children questionnaires were administered in order to characterize the exacerbation of asthma attacks. The Environment Assessment Guide of Allergic Patients was used to assess the bedrooms and living rooms in the home. RESULTS: Among the 210 asthmatic children and adolescents evaluated in 2001, adequate home environmental control was observed in 141 (67. 1 %), and no correlation was observed between the degree of environmental control and fewer (< 3) asthma attacks (p = 0. 39). Regarding the rooms where the asthmatic patients sleep, inappropriate furnishings were found in the homes of 93 patients (44. 3 %), including rag curtains in 84 cases (40. 2 %). Passive smoking was reported in 77 cases (36. 7 %). CONCLUSION: The level of home environmental control was satisfactory in the great majority of the residences, which may have contributed to the fact that no correlation was found between home environmental control and lower frequency of acute asthma attacks among the population studied...|$|R
40|$|Bakers are {{repeatedly}} {{exposed to}} wheat flour (WF) and may develop sensitization and occupational rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma to WF allergens. 1 Several wheat proteins {{have been identified}} as causative allergens of occupational respiratory allergy in bakery workers. 1 Testing of IgE reactivity in patients with different clinical profiles of wheat allergy (food allergy, wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, and baker's asthma) to salt-soluble and salt-insoluble protein fractions from WF revealed a high degree of heterogeneity in the recognized allergens. However, mainly salt-soluble proteins (albumins, globulins) seem to be associated with baker's asthma, and prolamins (gliadins, glutenins) with wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, whereas both protein fractions reacted to IgE from food-allergic patients. 1 Notwithstanding, gliadins have also been incriminated as causative allergens in baker's asthma. 2 We report on a 31 -year-old woman who had been exposed to WF practically since birth because her family owned a bakery housed in the same home where they lived. She moved from this house when she was 25 years, but she continued working every day in the family bakery. In the last 8 years she had suffered from work-related nasal and ocular symptoms such as itching, watery eyes, sneezing, nasal stuffiness, and rhinorrhea. These symptoms markedly improved when away from work and worsened at work. In the last 5 years, she had also experienced dysphagia with frequent choking, especially when ingesting meats or cephalopods, which had partially improved with omeprazole therapy. Two years before referral to our clinic, she began to have dry cough and breathlessness, which she also attributed to her work environment. Upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms increased when sifting the WF and making the dough. The patient did not experience gastrointestinal symptoms with ingestion of cereal products. Skin prick test results were positive to grass (mean wheal, 6 mm), cypress (5 mm) and Russian thistle pollen (4 mm), WF (4 mm), and peach lipid transfer protein (6 mm) and were negative to rice flour, corn flour, profilin, <b>mites,</b> <b>molds,</b> and animal dander. Skin prick test with a homemade WF extract (10 % wt/vol) was strongly positive (15 mm). Serologic tests yielded the following results: eosinophil cationic protein, 47 ?g/L; total serum IgE, 74 kU/L; specific IgE (ImmunoCAP; ThermoFisher, Uppsala, Sweden) to WF, 7. 4 kU/L; barley flour, 1. 24 kU/L; and corn, gluten, alpha-amylase, peach, and apple, less than 0. 35 kU/L. Specific IgE binding to microarrayed purified WF allergens (WDAI- 0. 19, WDAI- 0. 53, WTAI-CM 1, WTAI-CM 2, WTAI-CM 3, WTAI-CM 16, WTAI-CM 17, Tri a 14, profilin, ?- 5 -gliadin, Tri a Bd 36 and Tri a TLP, and gliadin and glutamine fractions) was assessed as described elsewhere. 3 The patient's serum specifically recognized ?- 5 -gliadin and the gliadin fraction, and no IgE reactivity was observed to other wheat allergens. Spirometry revealed a forced vital capacity of 3. 88 L (88 %), an FEV 1 of 3. 04 L (87 %), and FEV 1 /forced vital capacity of 83 %. A methacholine inhalation test was performed following an abbreviated protocol, 4 and the results were expressed as PD 20 in cumulative dose (mg) of methacholine. Methacholine inhalation challenge test result was positive (0. 24 mg cumulative dose) when she was working, and after a 3 -month period away from work and with no visits to the bakery house, it gave a negative result. A chest x-ray was normal. Specific inhalation challenge test was carried out in the hospital laboratory by tipping WF from one tray to another for 15 minutes. Spirometry was performed at baseline and at 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after the challenge with WF. Peak expiratory flow was measured at baseline and then hourly over 24 hours (respecting sleeping time). A 12 % fall in FEV 1 was observed at 20 minutes and a 26 % drop in peak expiratory flow at 9 hours after exposure to WF...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of Review: Sensitization to {{pets and}} animal dander {{is a risk}} factor for atopic eczema, {{allergic}} rhinitis, and asthma, and it has been assumed that pet ownership was a risk for sensitization. Several studies in the past decade have attempted to address this question, but it is still not clear if this is true and how we should advise our patients on the issue of pet ownership. Background: Many children around the United States suffer from allergies including allergic rhinitis, eczema, and asthma. The most common indoor allergens were generated from <b>molds,</b> house dust <b>mites,</b> and household pets. Repeated trips to the emergency room and doctor 2 ̆ 7 s office for allergy related conditions are strenuous on the medical community as well as the patient 2 ̆ 7 s and their families. It has been common practice to advise families who suffer from allergies to avoid keeping indoor pets. Results from recent studies have challenged this practice, as they show negative associations between early-life exposure to domestic pets and occurrence of atopy-related conditions. Atopic eczema is a common condition that affects more than one in ten children, and the incidence is only rising. It is defined as an itchy inflammation of the skin which causes a dry, red, flaky or scaly rash, also known as atopic dermatitis. Affected individuals must cope with a significant psychosocial burden, in addition to dealing with the medical aspects of the disease. Asthma is a disease caused by increased responsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree to various stimuli, which results in episodic narrowing and inflammation of the airways. Asthma can be a debilitating disease as well as a deadly disease if not taken seriously. According to the Center of Disease Control (CDC), in 2004 alone, there were a total of 198, 000 hospitalizations for asthma in children, and a total of 186 children died from asthma. Allergic rhinitis is defined as inflammation of the nasal passages that causes symptoms including sneezing, itching, nasal congestion, runny nose, and post-nasal drip. The most recent data from the CDC is a 1993 census that suggests at least 35. 9 million people have symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis, and up to 79. 5 million people experience greater than 7 days of nasal and ocular symptoms yearly. Objective: To find a correlation between indoor pets and childhood allergies including atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. As well as compile the latest recommendations for our patients and their families who suffer from these diseases. Methods: An extensive literature review and search was completed via Ovid and PubMed. Three main articles were used to compile this data 2 ̆ 2 Early Pet Exposure: Friend or Foe 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 Exposure to Dogs and Cats in the First Year of Life and Risk Allergic Sensitization at 6 to 7 Years of Age 2 ̆ 2, and 2 ̆ 2 Exposure to Pets and Atopy-related Diseases in the First 4 Years of Life. 2 ̆ 2 These articles were published from 2001 - 2003. For the latest data and up to date literature a more complete literature review was complied from research as current as this year, 2007. Results: The majority of studies reviewed found either no association or a decrease in risk of atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis, and asthma amongst pet owners. While there were a few articles that support the findings of an increased risk of asthma with an increased amount of animal dander. In the case of atopic eczema, the correlation between the presence of house dust mites and an increase in symptoms was stronger than animal dander and an increase in symptoms. The results of this literature review indicate that early-life exposure to pets or a lifestyle associated with pets might reduce the risk of developing atopy-related diseases, specifically asthma, eczema, and allergic rhinitis. Conclusion: Specific recommendations on whether patients who suffer from atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis, or asthma, should or should not avoid pets were not conclusive through this literature review. Even with multiple articles in support of both sides, a general consensus has not been reached in the medical community. Although recommendations can be made to help decrease the amount of allergens in the home to hopefully decrease the symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic eczema...|$|R
40|$|Rinitis je upala nosne sluznice različite etiologije, uključujući infekciju, alergiju ili hiperreaktivni odgovor na raznovrsne podražaje iz okoline. Praćen je simptomima opstrukcije, hipersekrecije, kihanja ili svrbeža nosa. Klasifikacije rinitisa se oslanjaju na etiologiju i težinu simptoma. Iako je s epidemiološkog gledišta najčešći virusni rinitis u sklopu obične prehlade, javnozdravstveno se značenje prvenstveno fokusira na kronični rinitis, alergijski i nealergijski. Alergijski rinitis se etiološki dijeli na sezonski i perenijalni, a prema trajanju simptoma na intermitentni i perzistentni (do 4 tjedna ili do 4 dana u tjednu, odnosno dulje od 4 tjedna ili više od 4 tjedana). Nazalni simptomi kod nealergijskog hiperreaktivnog rinitisa mogu biti izazvani samo kratkotrajno, nosnom iritacijom samo u trenucima ekspozicije okidaču refleksnog odgovora. Zbog odsutnosti značajnijih razina upalnih elemenata u nosnoj sluznici, u nekim oblicima nealergijskog neinfektivnog rinitisa, takav se odgovor nosne sluznice na iritanse svrstava u kronične rinopatije, koji se u posljednje vrijeme definira najčešće kao idiopatska rinopatija. U takvim rinitisima ključna je uloga proteina koji reguliraju ionske kanale u nosnoj sluznici, te neuralnih refleksa, koji dovode do kongestije, hipersekrecije ili kihanja. Terapija kroničnih rinitisa, alergijskih i nealergijskih, temelji se na izbjegavanju alergena, odnosno okidača te na primjeni toalete nosnih šupljina, antihistaminika, topikalnih kortikosteroida, antikolinergika i imunoterapije. Rhinitis is a {{very common}} {{disorder}} caused by inflammation or irritation of nasal mucosa. Dominant symptoms are nasal obstruction; however, in some patients, runny nose, excessive sneezing or nasal itch {{may be the most}} bothersome symptoms. The most common causes of nasal inflammation are viral infections and allergic response to airborne allergens. Response to irritants may cause similar symptoms, although signs of inflammation may not always be present. Viral rhinitis is lasting up to 10 days and {{it is part of the}} common cold syndrome. In short-lived rhinitis, lasting for 7 to 10 days, sometimes it is not easy to differentiate between the potential causes of the disorder, if general symptoms of infection like fever and malaise are not present. In long-living rhinitis, it is important to differentiate between infectious, allergic, non-allergic non-infectious rhinitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis. Itch and ocular symptoms are more common in allergic rhinitis, while other symptoms like nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea and sneezing may affect patients with allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. Patients with allergic rhinitis often have symptoms after exposure to irritants, temperature and humidity changes, like patients with non-allergic rhinitis, and such exposure may sometimes cause more severe symptoms than exposure to allergens. Sensitivity to a non-specific trigger is usually called non-specific nasal hyperreactivity. Allergic rhinitis occurs due to immunoglobulin E (IgE) interaction with allergen in contact with nasal mucosa in a sensitized patient. Sensitization to certain airborne allergen, like pollens, dust, molds, animal dander, etc. usually occurs in families with allergy background, which is helpful in making diagnosis in patients who have rhinitis in a certain period of the year, or aggravation of nasal symptoms occurs in the environment typical of certain allergen. The diagnosis is clinically confirmed by proving sensitivity to certain allergen on skin prick test, and by proving specific antibody IgE in patient serum. Allergic rhinitis is categorized according to sensitivity to allergens that occur seasonally, like pollens, or to allergens that are present all year round, like house dust <b>mite,</b> <b>molds</b> and animal dander, into seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis. Allergy to pollens causes the same mechanism of inflammation in response to allergens, which is the result of allergen binding to specific IgE antibody; however, patients with pollen allergy usually complain more of sneezing and runny nose, whereas patients with allergy to perennial allergens more often complain of obstruction, with the episodes of sneezing and runny nose occurring only when exposed to higher concentrations of allergens (house cleaning, around pets). Treatment includes avoidance of allergens, medical treatment and immunotherapy (allergy vaccines, tablets with allergens). Avoidance of allergens means reduction of environmental allergen load to the respiratory system including workplace, which is not easy to accomplish. Medical treatment is usually necessary to control symptoms, and it includes antihistamines, nasal or in tablets, and nasal glucocorticoids (steroids). Antihistamines should be second generation, which do not cause sedation, and such treatment shows more efficacy on runny nose, sneezing and nasal itch than on nasal stuffiness. Nasal steroids are more potent in improving nasal patency than antihistamines, and are at least as potent in the control of all other nasal and ocular symptoms. Nasal patency may be improved by nasal or oral decongestants, but such treatment should be reduced to as short period as possible, since after several days of using nasal decongestants rebound congestion may occur and patients will need nasal decongestants to improve nasal airways even when allergens are not around anymore...|$|R
