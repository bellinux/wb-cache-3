This <b>message,</b> <b>coded</b> “seek opinion,” initiated an active discussion of 10 other messages, seen as the thread in the lower left corner of Fig.  6.

40|$|AbstractInformation is {{typically}} transmitted in telecommunication systems {{in form of}} messages. Many applications nowadays demand protection of their content and/or authentication of the sender and recipient of the <b>message.</b> <b>Message</b> Authentication <b>Codes</b> are commonly used for the authentication purposes. They {{are very sensitive to}} any change of the message they are appended to. If one or more bits of the message change, <b>Message</b> Authentication <b>Codes</b> change about 50 % of their bits, making the message useless. A successful verification of <b>Message</b> Authentication <b>Codes</b> demands that all of bits of the received <b>Message</b> Authentication <b>Code</b> and of the bits of the recalculated <b>Message</b> Authentication <b>Code</b> from the received message are equal. Such a hard condition is not suitable for some applications. The introduction of a softer condition for the successful verification can improve the successful authentication of messages corrupted by transmission over a noisy channel. Algorithms are presented, which introduce robustness into the verification of messages protected by <b>Message</b> Authentication <b>Codes,</b> as well as an algorithm which not only verifies, but also corrects the messages corrupted due to the noisy channel...|$|R

40|$|<b>Message</b> Authentication <b>Codes</b> are {{constructed}} {{in such a}} way, {{that they are very}} sen-sitive to any change of the message they are appended to. This sensitivity of <b>Message</b> Authentication <b>Codes</b> is their most important property known as an avalanche effect,, which enables a good protection against forgeries. <b>Message</b> Authentication <b>Codes</b> change about 50 % of their bits, making the message useless due to the avalanche effect, if one or more bits of the message change. Therefore the successful verification of <b>Message</b> Au-thentication <b>Codes</b> demands equality of all of bits of the received <b>Message</b> Authentication <b>Code</b> and that one recalculated from the received message. This hard condition for the successful verification of messages protected by <b>Message</b> Authentication <b>Codes</b> is known as a standard or hard verification. Unfortunately the hard verification is not suitable for some applications, like multimedia applications for example. This paper introduces an algorithm with a softer condition for the successful verification, in order to enable the correction and improvement of the successful verification of messages corrupted by the noise on a transmission channel.

40|$|Gastrulation in {{sea urchin}} embryos is {{accompanied}} by a striking increase in the synthesis of N-linked glycoproteins, and inhibitors of this process block gastrulation. In this report, the <b>messages</b> <b>coding</b> for N-glycosylatable proteins in the developing embryo of the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, were examined. Total mRNA and mRNA isolated from membranes of the embryos at various stages of development were used to program a cell-free translation/glycosylation system prepared from rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with dog pancreas microsomes. The glycosylated translation products were separated from the nonglycosylated products by concanavalin A-agarose and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The results indicate that although the RNA derived from the membranes of gastrula-stage embryos contains <b>messages</b> <b>coding</b> for numerous glycoproteins, only trace amounts of glycoprotein messages are associated with membranes at earlier stages of development. mRNAs coding for four glycoproteins of Mrs 70, 000, 65, 000, 51, 000, and 30, 000 were examined further in total RNA preparations from the developing embryo. The data indicate that the <b>messages</b> <b>coding</b> for the glycoproteins of Mrs 65, 000 and 51, 000 are present also in the unfertilized egg and in the pregastrulation embryo. Because these two messages are not found associated with the membranes until gastrula stage, {{it is likely that the}} synthesis of these glycoproteins during gastrulation is regulated at the translational level. The <b>messages</b> <b>coding</b> for glycoproteins of Mrs 70, 000 and 30, 000, on the other hand, are not detectable in the unfertilized egg and may be synthesized de novo by the embryos. Thus, the expression of these two glycoproteins during gastrulation is regulated at least in part on the transcriptional level. On the basis of these findings, it appears that different modes of regulation are used for different glycoproteins that are synthesized during gastrulation...|$|R
