Here we present an approach to jointly exploit multisensor data for detection of mines from remotely sensed imagery. LWIR, MWIR, laser, <b>multispectral,</b> and <b>radar</b> sensor have been applied individually to the mine detection and each has shown promise for supporting automated detection. However, none of these sources individually provides a full solution for automated mine detection under all expected mine, background and environmental conditions. Under support from Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) we have developed an approach that, through joint exploitation of multiple sensors, improves detection performance over that achieved from a single sensor. In this paper we describe the joint exploitation method, {{which is based on}} fundamental detection theoretic principles, demonstrate the strength of the approach on imagery from minefields, and discuss extensions of the method to additional sensing modalities. The approach uses prethreshold anomaly detector outputs to formulate accurate models for marginal and joint statistics across multiple detection or sensor features. This joint decision space is modeled and decision boundaries are computed from measured statistics. Since the approach adapts the decision criteria based on the measured statistics and no prior target training information is used, it provides a robust multi-algorithm or multisensor detection statistic. Results from the joint exploitation processing using two different imaging sensors over surface mines acquired by NVESD will be presented to illustrate the process. The potential of the approach to incorporate additional sensor sources, such as <b>radar,</b> <b>multispectral</b> and hyperspectral imagery is also illustrated...|$|R

The use of covariates derived from <b>multispectral</b> and <b>radar</b> remote sensors allows mapping large areas and has the potential to improve the accuracy of soil attribute maps. The objectives of this study were to: (a) evaluate the addition of relief, and vegetation covariates derived from multispectral images with distinct spatial and spectral resolutions (Landsat 8 and RapidEye) and L-band radar (ALOS PALSAR) for the prediction of soil organic carbon stock (CS) and particle size fractions; and (b) evaluate the performance of four geostatistical methods to map these soil properties. Overall, the results show that, even under forest coverage, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and ALOS PALSAR backscattering coefficient improved the accuracy of CS and subsurface clay content predictions. The NDVI derived from RapidEye sensor improved the prediction of CS using isotopic cokriging, while the NDVI derived from Landsat 8 and backscattering coefficient were selected to predict clay content at the subsurface using regression kriging (RK).

Here we apply maximal invariants to design target detection algorithms which have constant false alarm rate yet maintain high target detection rate. Numerical comparisons will be presented for <b>multispectral</b> and multisnapshot <b>radar</b> images which illustrate that significant gains are achievable using invariance approaches. I.

40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the processes responsible for the formation of lunar sinuous rilles, a study of Rima Mozart was conducted using a variety of geologic, photographic, and remote sensing data. The apparent source of this rille is located in a highlands unit of known composition and it is hypothesized that thermal and mechanical erosion {{played an important role in}} the formation of Rima Mozart. Excellent photographic, topographic, <b>multispectral,</b> and <b>radar</b> data exist for this rille. The preliminary results of an analysis of this data are presented. Photographic data indicates the presence of two volcanic source vents for Rima Mozart: Kathleen and Ann. It is suggested that Rima Mozart, like many other lunar sinuous rilles, was most likely formed by a combination of events. Rima Mozart does follow a pre-existing, dominant NW/SE structural trend suggesting the influence of structural features on the rille, however, the tectonic influence is not the sole source for the formation of the rille, as suggested by the presence of the two source vents and the spatter around Ann. It is suggested that the rille formation began with an explosive eruption at Kathleen which later calmed down to a pulsating, high volume, low-viscosity lava flow. The rapid effusion rate of the magma as well as its high temperature and turbid nature helped carve the sinuous rille into the fractured and structurally weak Apennine Bench Formation underneath.

Its many interrelated wetland types undergo seasonal and longer-term changes due to weather and climate variations as well as anthropogenic land use such as grazing and burning. Mapping and monitoring of these wetlands has not been previously undertaken due primarily to their relative isolation and lack of resources. This study investigated the potential of remote sensing based classification for mapping the primary vegetation groups in the Dabus Wetlands using a combination of dry and wet season data, including optical (Landsat spectral bands and derived vegetation and wetness indices), radar (ALOS PALSAR L-band backscatter), and elevation (SRTM derived DEM and other terrain metrics) as inputs to the non-parametric Random Forest (RF) classifier. Eight wetland types and three terrestrial/upland classes were mapped using field samples of observed plant community composition and structure groupings as reference information. Various tests to compare results using different RF input parameters and data types were conducted. A combination of <b>multispectral</b> optical, <b>radar</b> and topographic variables provided the best overall classification accuracy, 94. 4 % and 92. 9 % for the dry and wet season, respectively.

For this paper, our study site was the Danube Delta. The biodiversity of the Danube Delta is extraordinary and it possesses one of the largest reed beds in the world. The main goal of our paper was to recognize, characterize and map the main vegetation units of the Danube Delta. The paper emphasizes the importance of the joint use of LiDAR measurements (acquired in May 2011), RADARSAT- 2 radar data (acquired on 4 June 2011) and SPOT- 5 optical data (acquired on 25 May 2011).

The radar measurements are based on C-band, providing additional information about the structure of the vegetation cover. The simultaneous acquisition of HH, HV, VV and VH polarizations enabled us to discriminate between the targets, depending on their responses to the various polarizations, by calculating their polarimetric signatures.
