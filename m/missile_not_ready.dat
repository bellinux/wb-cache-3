25|$|The main {{difficulty}} came in {{the design}} of the APR-28 guidance system undertaken by CKB-111 (later NPO Avtomatika). This meant that the Kh-28 <b>missile</b> was <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> until the 1970s. Flight trials were carried out on a Yak-28N, but by then the Yak-28 had ceased production and was perceived as obsolete, and the K-28P system was cancelled. Instead the Kh-28 was adapted for use by standard attack aircraft, in particular the Su-24 'Fencer-A' and Su-17M 'Fitter-C'.|$|R
50|$|Many {{people in}} Pakistan blamed Sharif for {{retreating}} from Kargil under American pressure. Growing fiscal deficits and debt-service payments mainly due to American sanctions after Pakistan tested its Nuclear Weapons in May 1998 {{as a response}} to India had led to a financial crisis. When asked about his reason for backing down from Kargil, Sharif said that Pakistan had only enough fuel and ammunition for 3 days and the nuclear <b>missiles</b> were <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> at that time. This comment made many Pakistanis brand Nawaz Sharif a traitor as Army doctrine called for having at least 45 days of fuel and ammunition and to have stand by nuclear missiles ready.|$|R
50|$|The US army {{procured}} 500 {{missiles and}} {{three sets of}} launching equipment to evaluate a prototype version of the missile between early 1952 and October 1953, but concluded that the <b>missile</b> was <b>not</b> currently <b>ready</b> for use, but that the continued development should be monitored. After development of the missile was completed, the US successfully re-evaluated the missile in mid-1958, and the later SS.11 (also by designer Bastien-Thiry) and Entac missiles were procured for Army use.|$|R
50|$|China's first {{ballistic}} missile submarine, Type 092 submarine (Xia-class), was {{laid down in}} 1978, launched in 1981 and commissioned by 1983. Its primary weapon is the JL-1 SLBM, with 12 launch tubes, as well as six 533 mm tubes for self-defense. The JL-1 <b>missile</b> was <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> until the first successful test launch of the missile from the Xia in 1988. Previous launch attempts from 1985 had failed. The missile's short range only permits the 092 to launch its missiles against regional targets. Striking targets far away require the submarine to travel dangerously closer to enemy waters. The Xia has since undergone a major modernisation refit, with a new black-coated paint and possibly other improvements with unofficial reports indicating the Xia is now carrying an improved missile, the JL-1A that {{is alleged to have}} longer range.|$|R
