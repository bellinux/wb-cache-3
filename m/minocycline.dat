5|$|<b>Minocycline,</b> lithium and N-acetylcysteine show {{tentative}} {{success in}} animal models.|$|E
5|$|Compounds {{that have}} failed to prevent or slow {{progression}} of Huntington's disease in human trials include remacemide, coenzyme Q10, riluzole, creatine, <b>minocycline,</b> ethyl-EPA, phenylbutyrate and dimebon.|$|E
5|$|If a chest tube {{is already}} in place, various agents may be instilled through the tube to achieve {{chemical}} pleurodesis, such as talc, tetracycline, <b>minocycline</b> or doxycycline. Results of chemical pleurodesis tend to be worse than when using surgical approaches, but talc pleurodesis {{has been found to}} have few negative long-term consequences in younger people.|$|E
5|$|Research {{has found}} a {{tentative}} benefit in using <b>minocycline</b> to treat schizophrenia. Nidotherapy or efforts to change the environment of people with schizophrenia to improve their ability to function, is also being studied; however, {{there is not enough}} evidence yet to make conclusions about its effectiveness. Negative symptoms have proven a challenge to treat, as they are generally not made better by medication. Various agents have been explored for possible benefits in this area. There have been trials on drugs with anti-inflammatory activity, {{based on the premise that}} inflammation might play a role in the pathology of schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} {{applied to the}} skin or taken orally to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of antibiotics for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective, especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical erythromycin. Commonly used antibiotics, either applied to the skin or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and <b>minocycline.</b> When antibiotics are applied to the skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical antibiotics, and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use together.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally <b>minocycline</b> therapy {{may result}} in {{autoimmune}} disorders such as drug related lupus and auto-immune hepatitis; <b>minocycline</b> induced auto-immune hepatitis when it occurs usually occurs in men who also developed <b>minocycline</b> induced lupus, however, women {{are the most likely}} to develop <b>minocycline</b> induced lupus. Significant or complete recovery occurs in most people who develop <b>minocycline</b> induced autoimmune problems within a period of a couple of weeks to a year of cessation of <b>minocycline</b> therapy. Autoimmune problems emerge during chronic therapy but can sometimes occur after only short courses of a couple of weeks of therapy. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome can occur during the first few weeks of therapy with <b>minocycline.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both <b>minocycline</b> and {{doxycycline}} {{have shown}} effectiveness in asthma due to immune suppressing effects. <b>Minocycline</b> {{as well as}} doxycycline have modest effectiveness in treating rheumatoid arthritis. However, the 2015 American College of Rheumatology guideline {{for the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis does not include <b>minocycline.</b>|$|E
25|$|In various {{models of}} {{neurodegenerative}} disease, <b>minocycline</b> has demonstrated neurorestorative {{as well as}} neuroprotective properties. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease have shown a particularly beneficial response to <b>minocycline</b> in research studies, and an antipsychotic benefit {{has been found in}} people with schizophrenia and <b>minocycline</b> is proposed as a possible addon therapy for some schizophrenics. Current research is examining the possible neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of <b>minocycline</b> against the progression of a group of neurodegenerative disorders including multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. As mentioned above, <b>minocycline</b> harms ALS patients.|$|E
25|$|Early {{research}} has found a tentative benefit from <b>minocycline</b> in schizophrenia, with several trials underway. A 2014 meta-analysis found <b>minocycline</b> may reduce negative and total symptom scores and was well tolerated.|$|E
25|$|Thyroid {{cancer has}} been {{reported}} in the post-marketing setting in association with <b>minocycline</b> products. When <b>minocycline</b> therapy is given over prolonged periods, monitoring for signs of thyroid cancer should be considered.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minocycline,</b> but not other tetracyclines, {{can cause}} {{vestibular}} disturbances with dizziness, ataxia, vertigo and tinnitus. These effects are again {{thought to be}} related to minocycline's greater penetration into the central nervous system. Vestibular side effects are much more common in women than in men, occurring in 50% to 70% of women receiving <b>minocycline.</b> As a result of the frequency of this bothersome side effect, <b>minocycline</b> is rarely used in female patients.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 study {{reported}} {{the impact of}} the antibiotic <b>minocycline</b> on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes and serum immune molecules in 40 MS patients over 24 months of open-label <b>minocycline</b> treatment. Despite a moderately high pretreatment relapse rate in the patient group prior to treatment (1.3/year pre-enrollment; 1.2/year during a three-month baseline period), no relapses occurred between months 6 and 24 on <b>minocycline.</b> Also, despite significant MRI disease-activity pretreatment (19/40 scans had gadolinium-enhancing activity during a three-month run-in), the only patient with gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI at 12 and 24 months was on half-dose <b>minocycline.</b> Levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12), which at high levels might antagonize the proinflammatory IL-12 receptor, were elevated over 18 months of treatment, as were levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). The activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was decreased by treatment. Clinical and MRI outcomes in this study were supported by systemic immunological changes and call for further investigation of <b>minocycline</b> in MS.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minocycline</b> is a {{relatively}} poor tetracycline-class antibiotic choice for urinary pathogens sensitive to this antibiotic class, as its solubility in water and levels in the urine are less than all other tetracyclines. <b>Minocycline</b> is metabolized by the liver and has poor urinary excretion.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the FDA added <b>minocycline</b> to its Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS); {{a list of}} {{medications}} {{under investigation by the}} FDA for potential safety issues. The AERS cites a potential link between the use of <b>minocycline</b> products and autoimmune disease in pediatric patients.|$|E
25|$|Also, more so {{than other}} tetracyclines, <b>minocycline</b> can cause the rare {{condition}} of secondary intracranial hypertension which has initial symptoms of headache, visual disturbances, dizziness, vomiting, and confusion. Brain swelling, as well as autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis are rare side effects to <b>minocycline</b> in some people.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minocycline</b> is {{typically}} delivered via slim syringe applicators.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minocycline</b> {{may cause}} upset stomach, diarrhea, dizziness, unsteadiness, drowsiness, mouth sores, {{headache}} and vomiting. <b>Minocycline</b> increases sensitivity to sunlight. <b>Minocycline</b> {{may affect the}} quality of sleep and rarely cause sleep disorders. It has also been linked to cases of lupus. Prolonged use of <b>minocycline</b> {{over an extended period of}} time can lead to blue-gray skin, fingernails and staining of scar tissue. This staining is not permanent but can take a very long time for the skin color to return to normal; on the other hand a muddy brown skin color in sun exposed areas is usually a permanent skin discolouration. Permanent blue discoloration of gums or teeth discoloration may also occur. Rare but serious side effects include fever, yellowing of the eyes or skin, stomach pain, sore throat, vision changes, and mental changes, including depersonalization.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minocycline</b> {{may also}} exert neuroprotective effects {{independent}} of its anti-inflammatory properties.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minocycline</b> also {{inhibits}} microglial activation, through {{blockade of}} NF-kappa B nuclear translocation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minocycline</b> is {{also known}} to {{indirectly}} inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS).|$|E
25|$|<b>Minocycline</b> {{was shown}} to be highly {{effective}} in conferring neuroprotection during murine cerebral malaria.|$|E
25|$|Tetracyclines {{should be}} used with caution in those with liver {{impairment}} {{and those that are}} soluble in water and urine worsen renal failure (this is not true of the lipid-soluble agents doxycycline and <b>minocycline).</b> They may increase muscle weakness in myasthenia gravis and exacerbate systemic lupus erythematosus. Antacids containing aluminium and calcium reduce the absorption of all tetracyclines, and dairy products reduce absorption greatly for all but <b>minocycline.</b>|$|E
25|$|Their {{most common}} current use {{is in the}} {{treatment}} of moderately severe acne and rosacea (tetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline or <b>minocycline).</b>|$|E
25|$|StoneBridge Pharma also markets <b>Minocycline</b> as Cleeravue-M in {{combination}} with SteriLid eyelid cleanser {{in the treatment of}} rosacea blepharitis.|$|E
25|$|When ingested, it {{is usually}} {{recommended}} that the more water-soluble, short-acting tetracyclines (plain tetracycline, chlortetracycline, Oxytetracycline, demeclocycline and methacycline) be taken with a full glass of water, either two hours after eating or two hours before eating. This is partly because most tetracyclines bind with food and also easily with magnesium, aluminium, iron and calcium, which reduces their ability to be completely absorbed by the body. Dairy products, antacids and preparations containing iron should be avoided near the time of taking the drug. Partial exceptions to these rules occur for doxycycline and <b>minocycline,</b> which may be taken with food (though not iron, antacids, or calcium supplements). <b>Minocycline</b> can be taken with dairy products {{because it does not}} chelate calcium as readily, although dairy products do decrease absorption of <b>minocycline</b> slightly.|$|E
25|$|A double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} {{study of}} <b>minocycline</b> for depression in 2017, {{adds to the}} growing body of literature addressing whether depression can be treated with drugs which reduce inflammation and foster nerve growth. The result was significant, suggesting that, in select patients who have failed to respond fully to more commonly used antidepressant drugs, it may be appropriate to try <b>minocycline</b> as an adjunctive therapy for depression, especially considering its relatively good safety profile.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in 2007, suggested that <b>minocycline</b> harms ALS patients. Patients on <b>minocycline</b> declined more rapidly than those on placebo. The mechanism of this side effect is unknown, although a hypothesis is that the drug exacerbated an autoimmune component of the primary disease. According to the researcher from Columbia University the effect {{does not seem to}} be dose-dependent because the patients on high doses did not do worse than those on the low doses.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{inflammatory}} lung diseases (panbronchiolitis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchitis). Both doxycycline and <b>minocycline</b> {{have shown}} effectiveness in asthma due to immune suppressing effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minocycline</b> in mice {{resulted}} in marked decreases in {{the levels of}} several markers, viral titer, {{and the level of}} proinflammatory mediators and also prevents blood brain barrier damage.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{most other}} {{tetracycline}} antibiotics (doxycycline excluded), <b>minocycline</b> {{may be used}} in those with kidney disease, but may aggravate systemic lupus erythematosus. It may also trigger or unmask autoimmune hepatitis.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Histone {{antibodies}} {{are positive}} {{in up to}} 95% of patients with drug induced lupus. DIThe most common medications associated with drug induced lupus are hydralazine, procainamide, isoniazid, methyldopa, chlorpromazine, quinidine, and <b>minocycline.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{bacteria}} that causes gingivitis {{can be controlled}} by using an oral irrigator daily with a mouthwash containing an antibiotic. Either amoxicillin, cephalexin, or <b>minocycline</b> in 16 ounces of a non-alcoholic fluoride mouthwash is an effective mixture.|$|E
25|$|Amoxicillin is {{occasionally}} {{used for}} the treatment of skin infections, such as acne vulgaris. It is often an effective treatment for cases of acne vulgaris that have responded poorly to other antibiotics, such as doxycycline and <b>minocycline.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{recent study}} (2007) found that {{patients}} taking 200mg of <b>minocycline</b> {{for five days}} within 24 hours of an ischemic stroke showed an improvement in functional state and stroke severity {{over a period of}} three months compared with patients receiving placebo.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minocycline</b> was {{patented}} in 1961 {{and came}} into commercial use in 1971. It {{is not a}} naturally occurring antibiotic, but was synthesized semi-synthetically from natural tetracycline antibiotics by Lederle Laboratories in 1966, and marketed by them under the brand name Minocin.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of an {{allergic}} reaction include rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing. <b>Minocycline</b> has also been reported to very rarely cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), a side effect also more common in female patients, potentially leading to permanent vision damage.|$|E
