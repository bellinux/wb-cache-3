500|$|Titanic {{suffered}} backlash {{in addition}} to its success. In 2003, the film topped a poll of [...] "Best Film Endings", and yet it also topped a poll by Film 2003 as [...] "the worst movie of all time". The British film magazine Empire reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings. In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film. Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. [...] "What really irks me...," [...] he said, [...] "are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it."

40|$|This arts-based inquiry explores {{visual art}} {{practice}} {{as a way of}} knowing, doing and sharing. The conceptual frame traverses the borderlands of postmodern creative practices and socially constructs a narrative of a Northern Ireland studio-based group of art therapists' visual, reflective and social conversations. These studio conversations explore how art therapists engage with art practice to understand and make meaning of their professional identities and practices, professional standards, and continuing professional development (CPD). The narrative findings show that the studio art practice enabled the art therapists to engage with, maintain, and develop understanding of Standards of Proficiency (SoP) relating to art making, and contribute to a range of CPD activity, both of which are in place to renew registration. The multiple dimensions of the art therapists' professional and personal identities were explored through conscious and unconscious processes, using different art media, which highlighted a particular need for art making as a form of professional and personal self-care. The art therapists' identities and practices were also constructed and understood in relation to personal biography, professional working contexts and roles, and current and past relationships. Interwoven throughout this thesis are self-reflexive fragments of my art practice, which highlight <b>my</b> <b>understandings</b> of myself as a developing researcher, and how I have negotiated my position as a participant, facilitator, and researcher during this journey.

2500|$|In 1993 Minnesota {{passed a}} {{provision}} that added sexual orientation to the state's human rights law. The provision has been characterized by its supporters as protecting “gay and lesbian teachers and students from discrimination”. In early 2003 Rep.

And it doesn't mean they're going to be homosexual, but unfortunately they hear about some of the sexual activities of the homosexual, and they're being told that it's safe and so forth and healthy, and it isn't.” He claimed “parents have complained to the schools, and administrators have told them that there's nothing they can do because of state law.” Lindner co-authored a bill to repeal this provision and worked to get it a hearing by a House committee. Meeting with homosexuals opposed to his bill Lindner stressed “I don't hate any of those people. I know they accuse me of hating and wanting all kind of terrible things to happen to them, but I don't hate any of them. I do love them. Actually this would benefit them if they were to leave that lifestyle or if they would maybe be more faithful to one partner, if it's got to be that way. But it's <b>my</b> <b>understanding</b> that gays have hundreds and even thousands of partners over a lifetime.” His remarks were seen as offensive by many Minnesotan homosexuals who said “most gays and lesbians are in committed relationships.” [...] They also took issue with Lindner's suggestion that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice.|$|E
2500|$|The 1967 Public Law 90-100 {{found the}} traffic in {{pornography}} to be [...] "a matter of national concern", {{as well as}} in obscenity. In this period the Court considered pornography to have two major dimensions. The first can be defined as dealing with sexual representations that are offensive to public morality or taste, which concerned the Court notably in the 1966 Ginzburg v. United States case. The second centers on the effect of pornography on specific individuals or classes, which is the focus of most public discussions and prior Court pornography decisions. This dimension was mentioned only twice in the array of decisions made in 1966. A frustration was expressed notably by Justice Hugo Black in the 1966 Mishkin v. New York: [...] "I wish once more to express my objections to saddling this Court with the irksome and inevitably unpopular and unwholesome task of finally deciding by a case-by-case, sight-by-sight personal judgment of the members of this Court what pornography (whatever that means) is too hard core for people to see or read." [...] In the 1974 Hamling v. United States decision the Supreme Court said that just because pornographic materials are for sale and purchased around the country, [...] "Mere availability of similar materials by itself means nothing more than that other persons are engaged in similar activities." [...] The 1976 American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defined that pornography consists of [...] "written, graphic, or other forms of communication intended to excite lascivious feelings". Since determining what is pornography and what is [...] "soft core" [...] and [...] "hard core" [...] are subjective questions to judges, juries, and law enforcement officials, it is difficult to define, since the law cases cannot print examples for the courts to follow. The Rehnquist Court further enhanced the power of community controls on pornography. Current Chief Justice John Roberts told at the confirmation hearing on his nomination: [...] "Well, Senator, it's <b>my</b> <b>understanding</b> under the Supreme Court's doctrine that pornographic expression is not protected to the same extent at least as political and core speech, and the difficulty that the Court has addressed in these different areas of course is always defining what is or is not pornography and what is entitled to protection under the First Amendment and what is not".|$|E
