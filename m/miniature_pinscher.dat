25|$|Syringomyelia (SM) is a {{condition}} affecting the brain and spine, causing symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis. Syringomyelia is characterised by fluid filled cavities within the spinal cord.

2500|$|In some breeds hair follicles {{in certain}} parts of the body become {{progressively}} miniaturized, analogous to what occurs in male pattern baldness in humans. [...] It is most commonly seen in Dachshunds, <b>Miniature</b> <b>Pinschers,</b> and Chihuahuas. [...] Affected areas become progressively more alopecic. The pattern of hairlessness that results is somewhat breed-dependent and sex dependent. In short-coated toy and miniature dogs, ventral neck, ventral chest, ventral abdomen and inner thighs are affected. In males, the pinnae (ear flaps) are affected. [...] In Greyhounds, the thighs are affected as well as the ventral chest and abdomen.|$|R

50|$|The Argentine Pila, Chaqueño variety, {{comes in}} three sizes: Small, between 25 and 35 cm (10 to 14 inches) at the withers, Medium, from 35 to 45 cm (14 to 18 inches) and Large, over 45 cm tall. Structurally, true ‘Chaqueño’ Pilas {{are very similar}} to <b>Miniature</b> <b>Pinschers,</b> with shorter backs than the other hairless breeds, and higher tail set-on, so that in motion the tail curls forward with the tip ideally just {{touching}} the back. Movement is less extended than in most breeds, but very elastic, with quick short steps, often -especially in the smaller dogs- in attractive hackney style which should be encouraged as distinctive to this breed. They are extremely agile, fast runners and great jumpers and climbers.|$|R

50|$|Harlequin Pinschers {{are small}} dogs that weigh {{anywhere}} from {{eight to ten}} pounds. They have short hair that can be blue or red merle. The ears can be cropped or left natural. Natural ears should be held erect {{with half of the}} ear dropping forward. These are known as rose prick ears. Their tails can be docked or left long. Personality: Harlequin Pinschers are known for their alert and inquisitive expressions. These little dogs are fearless despite their small size. In fact, many Min Pin fanciers state that the Min Pin is a large dog trapped in a small body. They can also be quite vocal and rambunctious. Harlequin Pinschers originated in Germany and were created by crossing traditional <b>Miniature</b> <b>Pinschers</b> with various toy-sized short-haired terriers. While these tiny dogs were once used as ratters, today they are lovable lap dogs. Furthermore, due to their small size, Harlequin Pinschers are great for people who live in apartments or small homes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{record of}} a rat-catching dog is that of [...] "Hatch", whose remains were recovered from the Mary Rose, the flagship of Henry VIII, sunk in 1545 and re-raised in 1982. Hatch {{is thought to have}} been a mongrel, and was brought on board to control the rat population. The breed name comes from the occupation of its earliest ancestors brought to the US by working-class British migrants as the dogs were used in rat-baiting. However they were, for the most part, bred for speed. Their speed is used for controlling vermin and hunting small game such as squirrels and hares. After the 1890s, as the breed type became popular in America, Beagles, Italian Greyhounds and <b>Miniature</b> <b>Pinschers</b> were bred in. Many of the foundation Rat Terriers were indistinguishable from small mixed-breed hunting dogs known as [...] "feists". The smaller varieties diverged from the Rat Terrier line very early on, with UKC registration for the Toy Fox Terrier beginning in 1936.|$|R

5000|$|The {{misconception}} that the <b>Miniature</b> <b>Pinscher</b> is a [...] "miniature Doberman" [...] occurred because the Doberman Pinscher (a breed developed by Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann around 1890) {{was introduced to}} the U.S. before the <b>Miniature</b> <b>Pinscher.</b> In 1919, the <b>Miniature</b> <b>Pinscher</b> {{was introduced to the}} AKC show ring. At the time, not knowing that it was referred to officially in Germany as the Zwergpinscher (little biter), the AKC referred to the breed as simply [...] "Pinscher" [...] and listed it in the miscellaneous category. When the <b>Miniature</b> <b>Pinscher</b> Club of America (MPCA) was created in 1929 (the year of the breed's official introduction into the AKC), they petitioned for Miniature Pinschers to be placed in the Toy group. The AKC's description, that the dog [...] "must appear as a Doberman in miniature," [...] led to the misconception common today that this breed is a [...] "Miniature Doberman Pinscher." ...|$|E
40|$|Dogs {{and cats}} with {{suspected}} skin disease {{referred to the}} Department of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zagreb, over a nine-year period were routinely screened for dermatophyte infections. A total of 5, 191 animals (3, 353 dogs and 1, 838 cats) were examined, from which 1, 263 cases of dermatophytoses were detected. The prevalence {{was found to be}} higher in cats (P< 0. 001) than dogs. The species most frequently isolated was Microsporum canis. Infection with Trichophyton mentagrophytes, M. gypseum and M. persicolor was comparatively rare. Infected animals were primarily crossbred dogs and cats, followed by <b>miniature</b> Doberman <b>pinschers,</b> collies, Dalmatians, dachshunds, terriers and boxers in dog, and Siamese and Persians in the cat population. Animals with dermatophyte infection were most often young male animals up to one year of age. The number of cats with clinically evident lesions was significantly higher (P< 0. 001) when compared to those with no lesion of suspected dermatophyte disease. However, in correlation to dogs there was a significantly higher proportion of irregular alopecia in cats (P< 0. 001). These results suggest that dermatophytosis, particularly M. canis, is now endemic in Croatia and that this situation is likely to persist. Dermatophytoses will continue to be encountered regularly in our clinical practice. U razdoblju od 1990. do 1998. u mikološkom laboratoriju Zavoda za mikrobiologiju i zarazne bolesti Veterinarskog fakulteta Sveučilišta u Zagrebu pretraženi su na dermatofite materijali od 5. 191 psa i mačke. Većina materijala uzeta je na Klinici Zavoda, a manjim dijelom u veterinarskim ambulantama na području Hrvatske, i poslana na pretragu zbog postavljanja etiološke dijagnoze utvrđene kožne bolesti. Infekcija dermatofitima ustanovljena je u 515 (15, 36 %) od ukupno 3. 353 pretražena psa i u 748 (40, 7 %) od ukupno 1. 838 pretraženih mačaka. Većina životinja bila je inficirana vrstom Microsporum canis, rjeđe vrstama Trichophyton mentagrophytes, M. gypseum i M. persicolor.

50|$|The <b>Miniature</b> <b>Pinscher</b> (Zwergpinscher or Min Pin) {{is a small}} {{breed of}} dog {{originating}} from Germany. The breed's earliest ancestors may have included the German Pinscher mixed with Italian greyhounds and dachshunds.

The <b>Miniature</b> <b>Pinscher</b> is reported to include the Dachshund and Italian Greyhound among its ancestors.
