5000|$|<b>Myrophine</b> (Myristylbenzylmorphine) is an opiate {{analogue}} {{that was}} developed in 1952. It is a derivative of morphine.|$|E
50|$|Benzylmorphine is {{an active}} {{metabolite}} of the opioid analgesic <b>myrophine,</b> formed in the liver. It has a metabolic fate {{similar to that of}} codeine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Myrophine</b> is {{substituted}} with a 3-benzyl {{group and}} a 6-myristyl chain. It is metabolised to form benzylmorphine and then further to morphine, {{and so is}} a long-acting prodrug for morphine, but with a slow onset of effects. It is weaker than morphine as an analgesic but longer-lasting in effects, and was thought to have more local anesthetic effect than morphine, though with a somewhat greater tendency to cause histamine reactions like itching and rash. In addiction studies conducted in human subjects in the 1950's, <b>myrophine</b> did not substitute for morphine in withdrawal, did not produce notable morphine-like effects, and did not produce addiction or dependence regardless of dose or how it was administered. Consequently, it {{was thought to be}} useful in treating pain in addicts who were being detoxified from other opioid drugs.|$|E
30|$|Eels of {{the genus}} Neenchelys appear to {{represent}} a closely related group, characterized by the position and form of the posterior nostril. It is a somewhat elongate slit {{on the side of}} the head above the lip, oriented obliquely in an anteroventral to posterodorsal direction, and is completely exposed (i.e., without a flap). Other characters include the terete form of the head and the presence of at least a rudimentary pectoral fin. A few other Indo-west Pacific <b>myrophines,</b> e.g., species of Skythrenchelys and Muraenichthys, also have the posterior nostril above the lip, but they greatly differ in appearance, with shorter heads and blunter snouts (Castle and McCosker 1999). Their posterior nostril is smaller than that of Neenchelys and is preceded by a dermal flap. Moreover, they lack all traces of a pectoral fin.|$|R
50|$|It is a Schedule I {{drug in the}} USA, {{considered}} to have high potential for abuse and no medical applications, and is controlled under international drug conventions. <b>Myrophine</b> is almost invariably used as the hydrochloride (free base conversion ratio 0.94) and has a DEA Administrative Controlled Substance Control Number of 9308.Myrophine is a Class A controlled substance in the UK, {{and is on the}} UN's Yellow list.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Skythrenchelys n. gen. {{differs from}} other <b>myrophine</b> ophichthids in the {{condition}} of its gill openings (moderately elongate and below lateral midline), dentition (large, conical and uniserial), posterior nostril (entirely outside mouth), and other characters. Skythrenchelys zabra n. sp., the type species, is described from India, the Philippines, Indonesia and northern Australia; S. lentiginosa n. sp. is described from the Red Sea. Scolecenchelys Ogilby, previously a subgenus of Muraenichthys Bleeker, is generically distinct {{on the basis of}} differences in dentition (teeth conical and uniserial or biserial vs blunt and multiserial), cephalic pores (2 pores between anterior and posterior nostrils vs 1 pore), and its posterior nostril condition (within vs outside mouth). Valid species of Muraenichthys and Scolecenchelys and their synonyms are identified. CASTLE, P. H. J., & JOHN E. MCCOSKER, 1999.

40|$|Larvae of Neenchelys Bamber {{are rather}} short and deep bodied, {{reaching}} about 75 mm before metamorphosis. They {{have a relatively}} short gut which is pigmented and slightly swollen at intervals along its length, as in larvae of other <b>myrophine</b> ophichthids. Neenchelys leptocephali also have a conspicuous midlateral patch of pigment about midway between the anus and caudal tip, and develop ova before metamorphosis...|$|E
30|$|A {{monotypic}} <b>myrophine</b> genus, Pylorobranchus (type species Pylorobranchus hoi McCosker, Chen and Lin, in McCosker et al. 2012), {{was recently}} described by McCosker et al. (2012) {{based on a}} series of large deepwater eels captured off eastern Taiwan. It is similar to species of Neenchelys and Pseudomyrophis in having the posterior nostril above the upper lip, but differs in being much more robust, having elongate jaws that do not completely close, and in possessing a third preopercular pore.|$|E
30|$|Smith and Böhlke (1983 : 83) {{discussed}} {{the problem of}} defining genera among the <b>myrophine</b> eels in which the posterior nostril opening is above the lip. Two of the characters they emphasized, the degree of development of the pectoral fin and {{the position of the}} dorsal fin origin, now appear less significant. The pectoral fin of the species treated here varied from well developed to rudimentary, and the dorsal origin varied from shortly behind the gill opening to behind the anus. Of the five groups mentioned by Smith and Böhlke (1983), Benthenchelys is the most distinct and can largely be eliminated from the discussion. It is small, short-headed, and large-eyed and possesses osteological characters that merit its recognition as a tribal sister group to the Myrophini (McCosker 1977). They also separated N. daedalus from other species known at the time (N. microtretus, N. buitendijki, and N. parvipectoralis) by its pelagic habits and dorsal fin origin, but as we have shown, this species conforms well with the others. That leaves only Neenchelys (as treated here) and Pseudomyrophis (which is known from the Atlantic and eastern Pacific).|$|E
