40|$|AbstractThe membrane-spanning domain (MSD) {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type I (HIV- 1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) is critical for its biological activity. Initial studies have defined an almost invariant “core” structure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>MSD</b> and demonstrated that it is crucial for anchoring Env <b>in</b> <b>the</b> membrane and virus entry. We show here that amino acid substitutions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>MSD</b> “core” do not influence specific virus–cell attachment, nor CD 4 receptor and CXCR 4 coreceptor recognition by Env. However, substitutions within <b>the</b> <b>MSD</b> “core” delayed <b>the</b> kinetics and reduced the efficiency of cell–cell fusion mediated by Env. Although we observed no evidence that membrane fusion mediated by <b>the</b> <b>MSD</b> core mutants was arrested at a hemifusion stage, impaired Env fusogenicity was correlated with minor conformational changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> V 2, C 1, and C 5 regions in gp 120 and <b>the</b> immunodominant loop <b>in</b> gp 41. These changes could delay initiation of the conformational changes required <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fusion process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — <b>The</b> <b>MSD</b> (Mass-Spring-Damper) model {{efficiently}} calculates shape {{deformation of}} {{many kinds of}} materials such as elastic, visco-elastic, and rheologic objects. For this reason, dynamic animation {{can be made in}} a personal computer and its popular acceleration board within the video-frame rate. <b>The</b> problem of <b>MSD</b> model is how to maintain shape precision of each deformation. For this purpose, we have calibrated coefficients of damper and spring of Voigt part and a coefficient of damper of <b>the</b> other part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basic <b>MSD</b> element under many surface points capturing a real rheologic object by the randomized algorithm. Nevertheless, the shape precision is not unfortunately enough. To overcome this, we improve our previous approach <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following five points: (1) The number of voxels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>MSD</b> model increases from 75 to 600. (2) The ratio between lengths of Voigt and <b>the</b> other parts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>MSD</b> element is added to three coefficients of spring and dampers of the basic element as calibrating parameters. (3) Four unknown parameters of the basic element are distinguished to calibrate in and on each voxel. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> parameters are distinguished to calibrate among surface and core areas of a virtual rheologic object. (4) In order to speed up the calibration, we use GA (Genetic Algorithm) in replace of RA (Randomized Algorithm). (5) Each or both of local and global volume constant conditions are added into <b>the</b> previous approach. <b>In</b> conclusion, we investigate relations between shape deformation, volume resolution, and number of calibrated parameters in several MSD models representing a rheologic object.

This {{study was designed to}} use miniscalpel-needle (MSN) technique as an intervention for work-related MSDs. Methods. Thirty-one patients with work-related MSDs and 28 healthy subjects were enrolled as controls <b>in</b> this study. <b>The</b> <b>MSD</b> symptoms of each patient were assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) and neck disability index (NDI). Blood samples were collected from control subjects and MSD patients before and after treatment. Serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were measured using ELISA. Results. Prior to MSN treatment, serum levels of CRP and TNF were significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>MSD</b> patients than <b>the</b> healthy controls. Serum CRP levels correlated with VAS and NDI scores, and serum TNF levels correlated with NDI scores. Compared to pretreatment, VAS and NDI scores were significantly lower in MSD patients after MSN treatment, while serum CRP and TNF levels were significantly lower compared with the healthy control levels. Conclusions. Our results indicate that MSN may be an effective intervention for work-related MSDs and be associated with lower serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers...|$|R
