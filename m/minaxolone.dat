50|$|A {{variety of}} {{synthetic}} derivatives and analogues of allopregnanolone with similar activity and effects exist, including alfadolone (3α,21-dihydroxy-5α-pregnane-11,20-dione), alfaxolone (3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnane-11,20-dione), ganaxolone (3α-hydroxy-3β-methyl-5α-pregnan-20-one), hydroxydione (21-hydroxy-5β-pregnane-3,20-dione), <b>minaxolone</b> (11α-(dimethylamino)-2β-ethoxy-3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one), Org 20599 (21-chloro-3α-hydroxy-2β-morpholin-4-yl-5β-pregnan-20-one), Org 21465 (2β-(2,2-dimethyl-4-morpholinyl)-3α-hydroxy-11,20-dioxo-5α-pregnan-21-yl methanesulfonate), and renanolone (3α-hydroxy-5β-pregnan-11,20-dione).|$|E
50|$|<b>Minaxolone</b> (CCI-12923) is a neuroactive steroid {{which was}} {{developed}} as a general anesthetic but was withdrawn before registration due to toxicity seen with long-term administration in rats, and hence was never marketed. It is a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, as well as, less potently, a positive allosteric modulator of the glycine receptor.|$|E
50|$|Several {{synthetic}} neurosteroids {{have been}} used as sedatives for the purpose of general anaesthesia for carrying out surgical procedures. The best known of these are alphaxolone, alphadolone, hydroxydione, and <b>minaxolone.</b> The first of these to be introduced was hydroxydione, which is the esterified 21-hydroxy derivative of 5β-pregnanedione. Hydroxydione proved to be a useful anaesthetic drug with a good safety profile, but was painful and irritating when injected probably due to poor water solubility. This {{led to the development of}} newer neuroactive steroids. The next drug from this family to be marketed was a mixture of alphaxolone and alphadolone, known as Althesin. This was withdrawn from human use due to rare but serious toxic reactions, but is still used in veterinary medicine. The next neurosteroid anaesthetic introduced into human medicine was the newer drug <b>minaxolone,</b> which is around three times more potent than althesin and retains the favourable safety profile, without the toxicity problems seen with althesin. However this drug was also ultimately withdrawn, not because of problems in clinical use, but because animal studies suggested potential carcinogenicity and since alternative agents were available it was felt that the possible risk outweighed the benefit of keeping the drug on the market.|$|E
50|$|Alfaxalone, {{also known}} as 11-oxo-3α,5α-tetrahydroprogesterone, 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-11,20-dione, or 3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnane-11,20-dione, is a {{synthetic}} pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone (pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione). It is specifically a modification of progesterone in which the C3 ketone {{has been reduced to}} a hydroxyl group, the double bond between the C4 and C5 positions has been reduced and is now a single bond, and a ketone has been substituted at the C11 position. Alfaxalone is also a derivative of allopregnanolone (5α-pregnane-3α-ol-20-one), differing from it only by the addition of the C11 ketone. Other closely related steroids include ganaxolone (3β-methyl-5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one), hydroxydione (21-hydroxy-5β-pregnane-3,20-dione), <b>minaxolone</b> (11α-(dimethylamino)-2β-ethoxy-5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one), pregnanolone (3α-hydroxy-5β-pregnan-20-one), and renanolone (5β-pregnan-3α-ol-11,20-dione).|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>minaxolone,</b> a new steroidal anesthetic agent, {{were derived}} after continuous intravenous infusion and bolus {{administration in the}} chronically catheterized sheep. There was a linear relationship between the steady-state blood concentration after continuous iv infusion and the infusion rate used, indicating <b>minaxolone</b> pharmacokinetics were linear. Further experimental {{evidence in support of}} this finding was the lack of dose dependence in any pharmacokinetic parameter following bolus doses through the clinical range of 1 2. 5 - 100 mg. <b>Minaxolone</b> was shown to have a high total body clearance between 3 and 4 liters/mm and a terminal half-life between 10 and 20 mm. Renal excretion of un-changed <b>minaxolone</b> was less than 1 %. Organ clearance studies indicated that <b>minaxolone</b> was totally extracted during passage through the liver but negligible extraction occurred during passage through the kidney and lung...|$|E
40|$|In 19 patients, <b>minaxolone</b> citrate, a {{water-soluble}} steroid anaesthetic agent, {{has been}} used as a continuous infusion to supplement nitrous oxide anaesthesia. The minimum infusion rate (MIR) was found to be 11. 3 ng kg ~ ' min ~ ' for patients premedicated with morphine 10 mg i. m. and breathing spontaneously 66 % nitrous oxide in oxygen. The cardiovascular and respiratory effects were similar to those described in a previous study for Althesin administered under comparable conditions. Recovery from <b>minaxolone</b> was prolonged compared with Althesin, and this may be related both to the water-solubility of the drug, and to its greater apparent volume of distribution. <b>Minaxolone</b> citrate (11 otN,N-di methylamino- 2 p-ethoxy- 3 cx hydroxy- 5 a pregnan- 20 one), a water-soluble steroid anaesthetic agent, was developed as a possible alternative to Althesin for the induction and maintenance of anaesthesia.

40|$|The {{effects of}} general anaesthetics, thiopentone, etomidate, <b>minaxolone</b> and {{ketamine}} were studied on identified voltage-clamped neurones of Helix aspersa. At concentrations of 0. 1 - 0. 5 mM, thiopentone, etomidate and <b>minaxolone</b> {{had no effect}} on the resting conductance of identified cells, D 1 and D 2. Ketamine at a concentration of 0. 1 - 0. 5 mM depolarized and excited the cells. All four anaesthetics tested depressed a chloride-dependent inhibitory response to acetylcholine (ACh) in cells D 1 and D 2 at concentrations of 0. 1 - 0. 5 mM in a dose-dependent and reversible manner with no change in the reversal potential of the response. These results show that general anaesthetics can block the transmitter-evoked chloride-mediated increases in membrane conductance in Helix neurones...|$|E
40|$|Analgesic neurosteroids such as 5 -pregnan- 3 -ol- 20 -one (53) are potent {{selective}} endogenous modulators of the GABAA receptor (GABAAR) while certain synthetic derivatives (i. e. <b>minaxolone)</b> additionally {{enhance the}} function of recombinant glycine receptors (GlyR). Inhibitory transmission within the superficial dorsal horn has been implicated in mediating the analgesic actions of neurosteroids. However, the relative contribution played by synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors is unknown. In this study, we have compared the actions of 53 and <b>minaxolone</b> upon inhibitory transmission mediated by both GABAA and strychnine-sensitive GlyRs in lamina II neurones of juvenile (P 15 - 21) rats. At the near physiological temperature of 35 °C and at a holding potential of - 60 mV we recorded three kinetically distinct populations of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) : GlyR-mediated, GABAAR-mediated and mixed GABAAR-GlyR mIPSCs, arising from the corelease of both inhibitory neurotransmitters. In addition, sequential application of strychnine and bicuculline revealed a small (5. 2 ± 1. 0 pA) GlyR- but not a GABAAR-mediated tonic conductance. 53 (1 - 10 µM) prolonged GABAAR and mixed mIPSCs in a concentration-dependent manner but was without effect upon GlyR mIPSCs. In contrast, <b>minaxolone</b> (1 - 10 µM) prolonged the decay of GlyR mIPSCs and, additionally, was 10 -fold more potent than 53 upon GABAAR mIPSCs. However, 53 and <b>minaxolone</b> (1 µM) evoked a similar bicuculline-sensitive inhibitory conductance, indicating that the extrasynaptic GABAARs do not discriminate between these two steroids. Furthermore, 92 % {{of the effect of}} 1 µM 53 upon GABAergic inhibition could be accounted for by its action upon the extrasynaptic conductance. These findings are relevant to modulation of inhibitory circuits within spinally mediated pain pathways and suggest that extrasynaptic GABAARs may represent a relevant molecular target for the analgesic actions of neurosteroids...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{designed}} to examine blood concentration-re-sponse relationships for <b>minaxolone</b> administered to sheep by either i. v. infusion or bolus injection in both clinical doses and overdoses. Responses examined included effects on sensory nervous, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The ratio of fatal blood concentrations to anesthetic blood concentrations (therapeutic ratio) was 3 to 4 without respiratory support other than endotracheal intubation to maintain a patent airway. Mm-axolone consistently depressed respiration rate, raised PACO 2 and depressed PAO 2. Death resulted from respiratory failure. With intermittent positive pressure ventilation, the therapeutic ratio was raised to 30 to 40. Duration of anesthesia after bolus doses was {{directly related to the}} logarithm of the dose. Cardio-vascular effects were minimal with clinical doses and mild overdoses and included slight tachycardia, slightly elevate...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of 8 -aminolaevulinic acid synthetase (E. C. 2. 3. 1. 37) (ALA-S) {{was measured in}} rat liver after the simultaneous administration of various anaesthetic agents and 3, 5 -diethoxycarbonyl- 1, 4 -dihydrocollidine (DDC) in vivo. Flunitrazepam, Althesin and phenobarbitone caused a sig-nificant increase in the {{activity of}} the enzyme which was not observed with propanidid, etomidate and <b>minaxolone.</b> It is suggested that DDC-treated rat, which resembles latent human variegate porphyria, may be a more valid method of testing drugs for their ability to elicit acute porphyric phases in susceptible individuals. The anaesthetic agents which induced the activity of hepatic ALA-S in this model are not recommended in patients with genetic hepatic porphyria. The porphyrias are a group of disorders of haem metabolism characterized by specific patterns of haem precursor overproduction, accumulation and excretion, each pattern defining a particular form of porphyria. Variegate, or South African genetic porphyria, is one of the forms particularly common in southern Africa. It has been estimated that there ar...|$|E
40|$|Background. Anaesthetic steroids are {{established}} positive allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors, but {{little is known}} concerning steroid modulation of strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors, the principal mediators of fast, inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain stem and spinal cord. This study compared the modulatory actions of ®ve anaesthetic pregnane steroids and two non-anaesthetic isomers at human recombinant a 1 glycine and a 1 b 2 g 2 L GABAA recep-tors. Methods. Recombinant a 1 glycine or a 1 b 2 g 2 L GABAA receptors were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and agonist-evoked currents recorded under voltage-clamp. Steroid modulation of currents evoked by GABA, or glycine, was quanti®ed by determining the potency (EC 50) and maximal effect of the compounds. Results. The anaesthetics <b>minaxolone</b> (EC 50 = 1. 3 mM), Org 20599 (EC 50 = 1. 1 mM) and alphaxa-lone (EC 50 = 2. 2 mM) enhanced currents mediated by GABAA receptors. The anaesthetics also enhanced currents mediated by glycine receptors, although with higher EC 50 values (minaxo-lone 13. 1 mM; Org 20599 = 22. 9 mM and alphaxalone= 27. 8 mM). The maximal enhancement (to 780 ± 950 % of control) produced by the three steroids acting at the GABAA receptor was simi...|$|E
