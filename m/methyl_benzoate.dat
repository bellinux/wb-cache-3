2500|$|Star-like waxy {{flowers are}} {{produced}} on [...] inflorescences {{arising from the}} stem from June to September in the wild with most flowers wilting by August. When cultivated in Europe however, the plant flowers between December and January. This flowering habit is what lends the orchid several of its common names, such as [...] "Comet orchid" [...] due {{to the shape of}} its flower and [...] "Christmas orchid" [...] due to the timing of its flowering. Each flower opens up with a green coloration, but eventually turns white with tones of light green. The amount of green in each flower can vary from plant to plant. It is claimed that the age-dependent color change is more pronounced in wild A.sesquipedale than in greenhouse-grown plants. The sepals tend to stay green for a longer time than the petals. As the flower ages further it goes from white to yellowish and then from orange to brown as it begins to wilt. As the wilting progresses the dorsal sepal bends down and then the lateral sepals bend inward with the lip remaining fairly stationary. Finally the entire flower closes in on itself. A distinctive feature of the flowers is that they have a long green spur attached. The spur of the flower is [...] from its tip to the tip of the flower's lip. The specific epithet sesquipedale is Latin for [...] "one-and-a-half-feet-long," [...] referring to the distance between the end of the spur and {{the very top of the}} dorsal sepal. At the end of the spur is a small amount of nectar usually about 40–300µl in volume. In general, longer spurs tend to have greater concentrations of nectar. This nectar fills the spur up to within [...] from the bottom of the spur. The nectar has been found to contain the sugars fructose, sucrose, glucose, and raffinose. The flowers produce an extremely intense spicy scent that can easily fill a room; this fragrance is only present during the night and is reminiscent of lily and some nocturnally flowering Nicotiana species. The scent has been found to be composed of approximately 39 different chemical constituents with its greatest concentration consisting of isovaleraldoxime, <b>methyl</b> <b>benzoate,</b> benzyl alcohol, isovaleronitrile, benzyl benzoate, phenylethyl alcohol, isovaleraldehyde, and phenylacetaldoxime.

40|$|The voltammetric {{reduction}} {{of a series}} of phenyl-substituted 4 -benzoyloxy- 1 -methylcyclohexyl bromides has been investigated in DMF. The reduction leads to the cleavage of the C-Br bond. On a thermodynamic ground, the direct {{reduction of}} the tertiary C-Br function is easier than that of the selected benzoates by at least 0. 5 V. However, since the direct reduction of bromides is affected by a large activation overpotential, the electron is first located in the benzoate moiety. The rate constant for the following exergonic intramolecular dissociative electron transfer was determined by kinetic analysis of the cyclic voltammetry curves. The intermolecular rate constants for the reaction between the radical anions of <b>methyl</b> <b>benzoates</b> and 4 -tert-butyl- 1 -methylcyclohexyl bromide were also determined and found to correlate very well with related literature data pertaining to tert-butyl bromide. The intramolecular rate constants were found to be more sensitive to variation of driving force than the corresponding intermolecular data. This result can be attributed to a shift of the center of the ð* orbital of the radical anion donor away from the acceptor moiety, the shift being larger for the most easily reduced donors. The resulting distance increase is therefore envisaged as responsible for a more rapid rate drop, compared to the intermolecular pattern, when smaller driving forces are considered...|$|R

The effect of ultrasound and the role of water on the conversion rates have also been investigated.

We observed that lipase-ultrasound assisted hydrolysis of AME in the presence of triolein and water showed the highest hydrolysis conversion rate (65. 3 %). Herein low water amount played an important role as a nucleophile being crucial for the hydrolysis yields obtained.
