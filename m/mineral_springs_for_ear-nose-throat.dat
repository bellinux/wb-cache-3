50|$|In 1859, John H. Gray {{discovered}} a <b>spring</b> while searching <b>for</b> petroleum {{in the village}} of Cambridge, Pennsylvania. The village was incorporated into the borough of Cambridgeboro in 1866. Gray examined the water found in Hot Springs, Arkansas in 1884 and concluded that the water of his spring also had medicinal properties. Gray formed the Gray's Mineral Fountain Company in August 1884 and financed the construction of a sanitorium. The opening of the Riverside Hotel was postponed to July 1, 1888 by construction delays, but was the first built in Crawford County. Disputes between partners of in the company forced the hotel into receivership. In 1895, the Riverside was sold to William Baird. Baird also purchased Gray's <b>mineral</b> <b>spring</b> <b>for</b> $60,000. Cambridgeboro was renamed Cambridge Springs in 1897 to reflect the status of the borough as a spa town.

A golf course was added in 1913, and was expanded to have 18-holes in 1923.|$|R
30|$|Spring {{water is}} a natural {{solution}} formed under definite geological conditions. Such waters are characterized via physico-chemical dynamism.

Specifics of spas in the Czech Republic and traditional spa in Japan show a strong linking to the aspects preferred within promoting corporate social responsibility (CSR). A survey that was made was focused on i) identifying way of the perception of various aspects of CSR in the spa / onsen, ii) identifying way of the perception of various aspects of CSR by the public authority („government“) in the spa resort, iii) comparing the level of conformity of both types of groups in the Czech Republic, and iv) comparing the results of the survey of Czech spas, Czech spa resorts and Japanese onsen in order to identify conformity and differences in the groups.
