Offices with definitions fairly unique to their programs are noted; otherwise, the definition is considered to be generally accepted across all Agency programs.

40|$|Measurement {{noise is}} one of the ISO-proposed {{metrological}} characteristics of areal surface texture instruments [1, 2, 3, 4]. Measurement noise includes all of the unwanted contributions to the output signals when the instrument is used in its normal operating condition [5, 6]. This paper focuses on detecting the non-linearity signature of the vertical stage of a focus variation microscope using the measurement noise and surface topography repeatability. The paper presents a procedure and <b>material</b> <b>measure</b> to determine the measurement noise and surface topography repeatability. The procedure is carried out at different height levels (5 %, 40 %, 55 % and 85 %) of the total vertical scanning range of the instrument, with equal contrast and brightness parameters. An optical flat with nano-scale surface texture is used as the <b>material</b> <b>measure</b> [7, 8]. One objective lens, with magnification of 100 ×, is used to measure the flat surface. Subtraction and averaging methods are used to evaluate the measurement noise. The surface topography repeatability is evaluated by calculating the standard deviation of the root mean square (Sq) surface texture parameter from several measurements taken successively under the same measurement conditions [9, 10]. The repeatability at each height level is calculated with five and ten repetitions. The results contain the signature of the non-linear motion of the vertical stage, which can be observed from the results of both the noise and the repeatability measurements. An increasing trend for both the noise and the repeatability is apparent. Using the subtraction method, the noise value is (1. 1 ± 0. 18) nm (see figure 1). For the surface topography repeatability, the obtained value is (0. 06 ± 0. 02) nm (see figure 3). The differences of measurement noise from different height levels are statistically significant. The non-linear behaviour of the vertical stage is attributed {{to the way in which}} the drive mechanism is guided and how the vertical axis is mounted on its guiding rails. In addition, the results of the motion stage non-linearity signature are compared with the results from the manufacturer (Alicona) and show good agreement (see figure 2 and 4) ...|$|E

40|$|Multiple-choice and essay {{tests are}} the typical test formats {{used to measure}} student {{understanding}} of economics in college courses. Each type has its features. A multiple- choice (or fixed-response) format allows for a wider sampling of the content because more questions can be given in a testing period. Multiple-choice tests also offer greater efficiency and reliability in scoring than an essay. The major disadvantage of a multiple-choice item is that the fixed responses tend to emphasize recall and encourage guessing. In an essay (or constructed- response) test, students generate responses that {{have the potential to}} show originality and a greater depth of understanding of the topic. The essay also provides a written record for assessing the thought processes of the student. Despite the claimed differences for each format, little empirical work exists to support the suppositions. If a multiple-choice and an essay test that cover the same <b>material</b> <b>measure</b> the same economic understanding, then the multiple-choice test would be the preferred method for assessment because it is less costly to score and is a more reliable measure of achievement in a limited testing period. If, however, an essay test measures unique aspects of economic understanding, then the extra examinee time and substantial scoring costs may be justified...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasound is {{a popular}} {{technique}} for industrial non-destructive testing (NDT) applications. By sending ultrasonic waves into an object and observing the amplitude and the delay of the reflected or transmitted waves, one can characterize the <b>material,</b> <b>measure</b> {{the thickness of the}} object, and detect discontinuities (flaws) as well as the size, location, and orientation of the defects in the object. Traditionally, ultrasonic transducers for NDT are made with piezoelectric crystals. Meanwhile, another class of ultrasonic transducers known as capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) have become popular in medical ultrasound research because of their large bandwidths and other attributes that allow them to be integrated into the tip of a catheter. However, CMUTs have not been widely adopted in ultrasonic NDT applications. In this thesis, three important CMUTs characteristics that could potentially make them attractive for NDT applications are introduced and demonstrated. First, CMUTs can be beneficial to NDT because the fabrication techniques of CMUTs can easily be used to implement high-frequency, high-density phased arrays, which are essential for high resolution scanning. Surface scanning using a 2 -D row-column addressed CMUT array was demonstrated. Secondly, CMUTs can be integrated with supporting microelectronic circuits, thus one can implement a highly integrated transducer system, which can be useful in structural health monitoring NDT applications. Front-end microelectronic circuits that include a transmit pulser and a receive amplifier were designed, tested, and characterized. Thirdly, CMUTs are suitable for air-coupled applications because of their low acoustic impedance at resonance. Air-coupled CMUTs fabricated in a standard RF-MEMS process were characterized and tested. This thesis concludes with an analysis of the potential usefulness of CMUTs for ultrasonic NDT. While many ultrasonic NDT applications are better off being performed using conventional piezoelectric transducers, CMUTs can and should be used in certain NDT applications that {{can take advantage of the}} beneficial characteristics of this exciting transducer technology...|$|E
40|$|Robots {{are capable}} to reach points {{repeatable}} in its workspace. However, the exact and therefore absolute approaching of points is for various processes insufficient. As a result, the robotic community tries to overcome limitations of robot’s accuracy by compensating path deflections during {{the execution of}} processes such as drilling or deburring. The use of additional sensor systems and the measuring of the pose offer one possibility to control the exact positioning. Conventional sensor systems in robotics hardly achieve a {{penetration of the market}} because of missing number of measured degree of freedom, lacking accuracy or limited possibilities for integration in robot cells. The conveived measuring principle of this dissertation applies the projection of a <b>material</b> <b>measure</b> in the workspace of the robot as a contact-free reference for a designed sensor system. The main contribution of the work is the development of a formalism and an algorithm that interpret the measurements of the projected reference structure and compute the pose based on image processing operations. Furthermore, the work deals with the simulation of the sensor system and evaluation of influencing variables. Afterwards a real test bed is presented and the experimental validation of the sensor system based on movements along lines or circles in a cuboid are outlined. One essential result is the achieved accuracy of the developed sensor system compared to a monocular approach which is presented as reference measurement. In case of a 6 D pose determination, the sensor systems achieves an improvement about 83, 2 %. In fact, when evaluating parallel test paths the translational accuracy is 0, 087 mm with an uncertainity 0, 048 mm of a defined assessment criteria. This shows the effectiveness of the measurement principle in order to set up robot system for complex and accurate machining tasks...|$|E
