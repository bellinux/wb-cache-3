Our new economic modeling for the United States suggests that greenhouse gas payments of up to $ 50 per tCO 2 e could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 700 million tCO 2 e per year through afforestation, forest management, and bioelectricity generation.

Two transects of 14 stations in total were made. One transect, crossing the Fram Strait from the east to the west, followed mainly the ice edge. The second transect extended latitudinally in a northerly direction, starting in ice-free areas, passing the ice edge, and ending in heavy ice-covered areas, approximately 100 nm north of the ice edge. Stations along this transect were sampled at almost constant water depths to avoid depth-related influences in our investigations. Results showed the expected high phytodetritus concentrations in the ice-edge vicinity. Concentrations of sediment-bound plant pigments were approximately 5 times higher than in ice-covered areas, indicating a very strong phytodetritus input. With increasing distance from the highly productive areas at the ice edge, we found significantly decreasing concentrations of phytodetrital input to the seafloor in a northerly direction. Within the foraminiferans, generic diversity was clearly reduced in the area of strong phytodetritus deposition. Along the latitudinal transect, out of the direct ice-edge influence, foraminiferal diversities slowly increased within increasing distance from the ice edge.

S. Twenty of the 25 designated areas that comprise NOAA's National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) have one or more Mussel Watch monitoring sites. Trace elements and organic contaminants were quantified including As, Ag, Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Zn, ΣPCBs, ΣPAHs, DDT and its metabolites, and butyltins. The Mussel Watch sites located in or near the 20 Reserves provide for both status and trends. Generally the Reserves have trace element and organic contaminant concentrations that are at or below the median concentration determined for all NS&T Mussel Watch monitoring data. Trends were derived using the Spearman-rank correlation coefficient. It was possible to determine if trends exist for sites at which six or more years of data are available. Generally no trends were found for trace elements but when trends were found they were usually decreasing.

40|$|A {{local and}} gauge {{invariant}} alternative version of QCD for massive fermions introduced in previous works, is considered here to just propose a theory which includes Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) terms in its defining {{action in a}} renormalizable form. The Lagrangian includes {{a special kind of}} new vertices which at first sight, look as breaking power counting renormalizability. However, these terms also modify the quark propagators, to become <b>more</b> <b>decreasing</b> that the Dirac propagator at large momenta, indicating that the theory is renormalizable. Therefore, it follows the surprising conclusion that the added NJL four fermions terms does not break renormalizability.

The structure of the free propagator, given by the substraction between a massive and a massless Dirac one in the Lee-Wick form, also suggests that the theory retains unitarity, if the radiative corrections make the massless quarks become non propagating. The appearance of finite masses in the theory is justified {{by the fact that the}} new action terms break chiral invariance.

The renormalized Feynman diagram expansion of the model is written here and the formula for the degree of divergence of the diagrams is derived. The primitive divergent graphs are identified. We start their evaluation through the calculation of the divergence of the gluon polarization operator.
