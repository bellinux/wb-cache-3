40|$|In this study, {{the energy}} {{utilization}} and environmental {{aspects of the}} rice processing industries in Bangladesh was analyzed. Rice husk, a <b>milling</b> <b>by-product</b> of rice, {{is used as a}} source of thermal energy to produce steam for parboiling of raw rice. The rice is mostly dried on a concrete floor under the sunshine. In mechanical drying, rice husks are used as a source of primary energy. In Bangladesh, the annual estimated energy used in 2000 for the drying of rice by sunshine was 10. 7 million GJ and for drying and parboiling by rice husks it was 48. 2 million GJ. These amounts will increase to 20. 5 and 92. 5 million GJ in 2030, respectively. Electrical energy consumption for mechanical drying and milling of rice was calculated as 1. 83 million GJe and 3. 51 million GJe in 2000 and in 2030, respectively. Biogenic carbon dioxide emission from burning of rice husk is renewed every year by the rice plant. Both the biogenic and non-biogenic carbon dioxide emissions in 2000 were calculated as 5. 7 and 0. 4 million tonnes, respectively, which will increase to 10. 9 and 0. 7 million tonnes in 2030. The demand of energy for rice processing increases every year, therefore, energy conservation in rice processing industries would be a viable option to reduce the intensity of energy by increasing the efficiency of rice processing systems which leads to a reduction in emissions and an increased supply of rice husk energy to other sectors as well...|$|E

Lutein was the major carotenoid (229  26 μg/ 100 g) found in the peel of “Mateus” cultivar followed by β-carotene with a content of 174  11 μg/ 100 g. The mean value found for α-tocopherol content in seeds was higher than 0. 90 mg/ 100 g. This vitamin was quantified in all the fruit parts and the content increased in the following order: pulp<peel<seeds. Annona cherimola <b>Mill.</b> <b>by-products</b> (peel and seeds) can be potentially rich in bioactive compounds, especially lutein and α-tocopherol, indicating promising sources of high value natural extracts that can have potential {{to be used in}} the development of nutraceuticals or pharmaceuticals to benefit human health.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} at JUST agricultural research center during 1999 - 2000 growing season to evaluate the effects of soil amendment with olive <b>mill</b> <b>by-products</b> (Jift) on growth of faba bean and their symbiosis with VA fungi. Soil was amended with Jift at different levels (Jift: Soil; 0 : 10, 1 : 9, 2 : 8, 3 : 7 and 4 : 6) and exposed to solarization, methyl bromide and fungicide treatments. A split plot design with three replications was used, in which soil treatments (solarization, methyl bromide, fungicide and untreated control) were assigned to main plots and soil-Jift mixtures to sub plots. Our data indicated that the maximum seed yield (2943 kg ha 1) was achieved under soil mixtures treated with fungicide, followed by those which treated with methyl bromide (2662 kg ha 1) and untreated control (2343 kg ha 1). When Jift was considered as main factor, seed yield {{was found to be}} increased as Jift level was increased in soil mixtures. Even so, seed yield (2861 kg ha 1) at the highest Jift level (3 : 7) was not considerably different from the yield at the rate of 2 : 8 (2998 kg ha 1). Phosphorus nutrition may be enhanced with Jift amendment remarkably for soils branded by low organic matter contents. Mycorrhizal fungi population and symbiosis with the legume crops could be increased when Jift was added to the soil, particularly under soil sterilization practices...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} impacts that large-scale alcohol {{production from}} corn, grain sorghum, and crop residues {{may have on}} U. S. agriculture in the year 2000 are investigated. A one land group interregional linear programming model is used. The objective function is to minimize the cost of production in the agricultural sector, given specified crop demands and constrained resources;The impacts that levels of alcohol production, ranging from zero to 12 billion gallons, have at two projected levels of crop demands, two grain-to-alcohol conversion and two milling methods, wet and dry, rates are considered. At the lower level of crop demands, 1980 crop exports are used and at the higher level of demands, one-half times 1980 crop exports are used. A rate of conversion which reflects current technology, 2. 6 gallons of alcohol per bushel of grain, and one which reflects a maximum potential rate of conversion, 3. 0 gallons per bushel of grain, are incorporated into the model;The impacts that large-scale fuel alcohol production has on U. S. agriculture are small. The major impacts that occur are the substitution of <b>milling</b> <b>by-products,</b> DDG, gluten feed, and gluten meal, for soybean meal in livestock feed rations. Production of 12 billion gallons of alcohol {{is estimated to be}} equivalent to an 18 percent increase in crop exports. Improving the grain-to-alcohol conversion rate from 2. 6 to 3. 0 gallons per bushels reduces the overall cost of agricultural production by 989 billion when 12 billion gallons of alcohol are produced...|$|R
