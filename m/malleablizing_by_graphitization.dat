30|$|Crystallization is {{a process}} for atoms to {{overcome}} an activation energy of crystallization at an appreciable probability. In general, low-temperature crystallization is possible if (1) {{a significant amount of}} input energy is stored and (2) there is a trigger to release the stored energy to induce crystallization. d’Hendecourt et al. (1982) observed that the energy stored in their OR is released at ∼ 30 K. Recently, Kaito et al. (2006) prepared particles of amorphous Mg silicate coated with amorphous carbon. They found that their crystallization temperatures are lowered substantially due to the energy released <b>by</b> <b>graphitization</b> of amorphous carbon. Inclusion of CH 4 in the amorphous carbon mantle further reduces the crystallization temperature to room temperature (Kaito et al., 2007). Although their experiments does not necessarily simulate crystallization of cometary silicate, they prove that a silicate core proceeds with forsterite crystallization upon releasing energy in its outer layer. The temperature to trigger the nonthermal crystallization could be further lowered, if the stored energy is released at much lower temperatures.

40|$|Graphite fiber reinforced/copper matrix {{composites}} have sufficiently high {{thermal conduction}} {{to make them}} candidate materials for critical heat transmitting and rejection components. The term textile composites arises because the preform is braided from fiber tows, conferring three-dimensional reinforcement and near net shape. The principal issues investigated {{in the past two}} years have centered on developing methods to characterize the preform and fabricated composite and on braidability. It is necessary to have an analytic structural description for both processing and final property modeling. The structure of the true 3 -D braids used is complex and has required considerable effort to model. A structural mapping has been developed as a foundation for analytic models for thermal conduction and mechanical properties. The conductivity has contributions both from the copper and the reinforcement. The latter is accomplished <b>by</b> <b>graphitization</b> of the fibers, the higher the amount of graphitization the greater the conduction. This is accompanied by an increase in the fiber modulus, which is desirable from a stiffness point of view but decreases the braidability; the highest conductivity fibers are simply too brittle to be braided. Considerable effort has been expended on determining the optimal braidability [...] conductivity region. While a number of preforms have been fabricated, one other complication intervenes; graphite and copper are immiscible, resulting in a poor mechanical bond and difficulties in infiltration by molten copper. The approach taken is to utilize a proprietary fiber coating process developed by TRA, of Salt Lake City, Utah, which forms an itermediary bond. A number of preforms have been fabricated from a variety of fiber types and two sets of these have been infiltrated with OFHC copper, one with the TRA coating and one without.

DLC coatings can effectively lower {{the coefficient of}} friction (CoF) and wear rate of engine components, consequently improving the fuel efficiency and durability of these components. Therefore, the interaction between nonferrous coatings (e. g., DLC) and vegetal oil must be investigated. A ball-on-plate tribotester was used to run the experiments using stainless steel plates coated with amorphous hydrogenated (a-C:H) DLC and hydrogen-free tetrahedral (ta-C) DLC sliding against 440 C stainless steel ball. Raman analysis was performed to investigate the structural change of the coatings. At high temperatures, the CoF decreases in both coatings but the wear rate increases in the a-C:H and decreases in the ta-C DLC-coated plates. CoF and wear rate (coated layer and counter surface) are mostly influenced <b>by</b> coating <b>graphitization.</b> The degree of graphitization increases with increasing temperature. Graphitization occurs in the tribological contact because of friction-induced heating under contact and high contact stress conditions. 1...|$|R
40|$|High {{surface area}} {{electrode}} materials {{are of interest}} {{for a wide range}} of potential applications such as super-capacitors and electrochemical cells. This paper describes a fabrication method of three-dimensional (3 D) graphene conformally coated on nanoporous insulating substrate with uniform nanopore size. 3 D graphene films were formed <b>by</b> controlled <b>graphitization</b> of diamond-like amorphous carbon precursor films, deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD). Plasma-assisted graphitization was found to produce better quality graphene than a simple thermal graphitization process. The resulting 3 D graphene/amorphous carbon/alumina structure has a very high surface area, good electrical conductivity and exhibits excellent chemically stability, providing a good material platform for electrochemical applications. Consequently very large electrochemical capacitance values, as high as 2. 1 mF for a sample of 10 mm(3), were achieved. The electrochemical capacitance of the material exhibits a dependence on bias voltage, a phenomenon observed by other groups when studying graphene quantum capacitance. The plasma-assisted graphitization, which dominates the graphitization process, is analyzed and discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|Ductile {{cast iron}} with {{different}} copper content was precipitation hardened. Cast iron with 0. 48 % Cu content was ferritized. That operation was ended with rapid quenching, and then aged. Cast iron with 1. 27 or 2. 10 % Cu content was spheroid annealing. After rapid quenching cast iron was aged. Not {{alloy cast iron}} with small copper content (0. 04 %) had a chemical composition similar to cast iron with 0. 48 % Cu content. Such copper was for tests {{in order to obtain}} an answer for the question whether only copper is responsible for precipitate hardening effects. Metalographic microscope tests (LM, SEM) of mechanical properties (Rm, Rp, A 5, Z, K and H) and x-ray diffraction tests were performed. It has been stated, that hardening of ferretic cast iron let to obtain tensile strength above 500 MPa and elongation approx. 23 %. Precipitation hardening of ductile cast iron efficiently compensates reducing of hardening caused <b>by</b> partial <b>graphitization</b> and spheroidization of pearlitic cementite...|$|R
40|$|Thermo-optical {{properties}} of hydrogenated amorphous carbon nitride layers (a-C:N:H) deposited on crystalline silicon by plasma assisted {{chemical vapour deposition}} were studied. The layers were characterized by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and their chemical composition, i. e. [N]/[C] ratio, was determined by energy dispersive X-ray technique. The optic measurements were made by spectroscopic ellipsometer Wollam M 2000 equipped with a heated vacuum chamber. The measurements of ellipsometric angles were carried out during heating the sample from room temperature to 300 C. Refractive index, extinction coefficient and the layer thicknesses were calculated by fitting {{the model of the}} layer to the ellipsometric data. The results confirm that at about 23 C the layer properties are changed. The measured thermo-optical parameters, dn/dT and dk/dT, show abrupt change from negative to positive values which can be explained <b>by</b> structure <b>graphitization.</b> Simultaneously, the bandgap decreases from 2. 5 to 0. 7 eV and the layer thickness drops to about 50 % of the initial value...|$|R
