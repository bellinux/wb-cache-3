25|$|Stimulated {{emission}} {{was first}} {{observed in the}} <b>microwave</b> <b>region</b> of the electromagnetic spectrum, giving rise to the acronym MASER for Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. In the <b>microwave</b> <b>region,</b> the Boltzmann distribution of molecules among energy states is such that, at room temperature all states are populated almost equally.|$|E
25|$|The energy {{difference}} between the msnbsp&= 0 and msnbsp&= ±1 states corresponds to the <b>microwave</b> <b>region.</b> Thus by irradiating the N-V centers with microwave radiation, one can change the relative population of those levels, thereby again modulating the luminescence intensity.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} radiation-induced free {{radicals}} in biological substances (for cancer research) poses the additional problem that tissue contains water, and water (due to its electric dipole moment) {{has a strong}} absorption band in the <b>microwave</b> <b>region</b> used in EPR spectrometers.|$|E

50|$|These {{molecules}} {{have equal}} moments of inertia about any axis, and {{belong to the}} point groups Td (tetrahedral AX4) and Oh (octahedral AX6). Molecules with these symmetries have a dipole moment of zero, so {{do not have a}} pure rotation spectrum in the infrared or <b>microwave</b> <b>regions.</b>|$|R
25|$|Researchers at Princeton University have {{recently}} built a quantum well laser {{which is no}} bigger than a grain of rice. The laser is powered by a single electron which passes through two quantum dots; a double quantum dot. The electron moves from a state of higher energy, to a state of lower energy whilst emitting photons in the <b>microwave</b> <b>region.</b> These photons bounce off mirrors to create a beam of light; the laser.|$|E
25|$|When {{the laser}} was developed, Townes and Schawlow {{and their colleagues}} at Bell Labs pushed {{the use of the}} term optical maser, but this was largely {{abandoned}} in favor of laser, coined by their rival Gordon Gould. In modern usage, devices that emit in the X-ray through infrared portions of the spectrum are typically called lasers, and devices that emit in the <b>microwave</b> <b>region</b> and below are commonly called masers, regardless of whether they emit microwaves or other frequencies.|$|E
25|$|The CMB {{essentially}} {{confirms the}} Big Bang theory. In the late 1940s Alpher and Herman reasoned {{that if there}} was a big bang, {{the expansion of the universe}} would have stretched and cooled the high-energy radiation of the very early universe into the <b>microwave</b> <b>region</b> of the electromagnetic spectrum, and down to a temperature of about 5K. They were slightly off with their estimate, but they had exactly the right idea. They predicted the CMB. It took another 15 years for Penzias and Wilson to stumble into discovering that the microwave background was actually there.|$|E
40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} spectrum describes {{the frequencies of}} electromagnetic radiation with the spectral, thermal, and <b>microwave</b> <b>regions</b> being of key importance for characterizing, mapping, and monitoring the components of wetlands. A diverse range of ground, airborne, and spaceborne active and passive sensors are available to provide data in these regions, with these operating across {{a broad range of}} spatial resolutions and coverages and temporal frequencies...|$|R
25|$|Early {{conventional}} tube {{systems were}} limited to the high frequency bands, and although very high frequency systems became widely available in the late 1930s, the ultra high frequency and <b>microwave</b> <b>regions</b> were well beyond the ability of conventional circuits. The magnetron {{was one of the}} few devices able to generate signals in the microwave band and it was the only one that was able to produce high power at centimeter wavelengths.|$|R
30|$|Sr 1 −xTiO 3 or BST) {{thin films}} have been {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the most important candidates for the development of tunable microwave components. However, the relatively large dielectric insertion loss, soft mode effect, and limited figure of merit at high-frequency <b>microwave</b> <b>regions</b> still restrict practical applications in tunable microwave elements. Therefore, optimizing the microwave dielectric properties by lowering the dielectric loss tangent and enhancing dielectric tunability has become an important issue for device applications[13 – 19].|$|R
25|$|The {{heat of the}} {{explosion}} causes air in the vicinity to become ionized, creating the fireball. The free electrons in the fireball affect radio waves, especially at lower frequencies. This causes a large area of the sky to become opaque to radar, especially those operating in the VHF and UHF frequencies, which is common for long-range early warning radars. The effect is less for higher frequencies in the <b>microwave</b> <b>region,</b> as well as lasting a shorter time – the effect falls off both in strength and the effected frequencies as the fireball cools and the electrons begin to re-form onto free nuclei.|$|E
25|$|The {{infrared}} {{portion of}} the electromagnetic spectrum is usually divided into three regions; the near-, mid- and far- infrared, named for their relation to the visible spectrum. The higher-energy near-IR, approximately 14000–4000cm−1 (0.8–2.5μm wavelength) can excite overtone or harmonic vibrations. The mid-infrared, approximately 4000–400cm−1 (2.5–25μm) may be used to study the fundamental vibrations and associated rotational-vibrational structure. The far-infrared, approximately 400–10cm−1 (25–1000μm), lying adjacent to the <b>microwave</b> <b>region,</b> has low energy and may be used for rotational spectroscopy. The names and classifications of these subregions are conventions, and are only loosely based on the relative molecular or electromagnetic properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} the {{rotational}} constant B is {{much smaller than the}} vibrational one νo, such that a much smaller amount of energy is required to rotate the molecule; for a typical molecule, this lies within the <b>microwave</b> <b>region.</b> However, the vibrational energy of HCl molecule places its absorptions within the infrared region, allowing a spectrum showing the rovibrational transitions of this molecule to be easily collected using an infrared spectrometer with a gas cell. The latter can even be made of quartz as the HCl absorption lies in a window of transparency for this material.|$|E
40|$|Terahertz (THz) {{radiation}} has {{a frequency}} {{of the order of}} 101212 Hz. This lies between the infrared and <b>microwave</b> <b>regions</b> of the electromagnetic spectrum; a section labeled the 'THz gap'. Infrared and microwave radiation is used in the medical field; research is underway for an application for THz radiation. At present no formal safety analysis of a THz pulsed imaging (TPI) system has been performed. This will be necessary for future in vivo studies. The radiation is delivered in a train of femtosecond pulses. International guidelines on exposure to non-ionizing radiation, and supporting literature, were reviewed to determine the Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) for radiation of this range of wavelengths, both for a single pulse and continuous wave exposure. Two methods of deriving the MPE were identified. Current guidelines for infrared and <b>microwave</b> <b>regions</b> of the electromagnetic spectrum incorporate the THz region. Using conservative parameter estimation an MPE per pulse, over the area of the beam, of 94 W was calculated. At present THz pulsed imaging systems produce pulses of power approximately 1 mW; this lies within the limit calculated using the published guidelines. There are, however, areas requiring further investigation before the technique becomes routine in clinical practice...|$|R

The large values of the weight factor C 2 (= 0. 70) for group rotation, indicates that the relaxation is largely duo to group rotation in both the cases. A Poley absorption in the high frequency region is also observed in both...|$|R
25|$|It was {{noticed that}} when the {{magnetron}} was operating at the critical value, it would emit energy in the radio frequency spectrum. This occurs because {{a few of the}} electrons, instead of reaching the anode, continue to circle in the space between the cathode and the anode. Due to an effect now known as cyclotron radiation, these electrons radiate radio frequency energy. The effect is not very efficient. Eventually the electrons hit one of the electrodes, so the number in the circulating state at any given time is {{a small percentage of the}} overall current. It was also noticed that the frequency of the radiation depends on the size of the tube, and even early examples were built that produced signals in the <b>microwave</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E

AVIRIS and SAR underwent extensive in-flight engineering testing in 1987 and 1988 and are scheduled to become operational in 1989. TIMS has been in operation for several years.

50|$|Even if the Q {{factor of}} VHF {{inductors}} and capacitors is {{high enough to}} be useful, their parasitic properties can significantly affect their performance in this frequency range. The shunt capacitance of an inductor may be more significant than its desirable series inductance. The series inductance of a capacitor may be more significant than its desirable shunt capacitance. As a result, in the VHF or <b>microwave</b> <b>regions,</b> a capacitor {{may appear to be}} an inductor and an inductor may appear to be a capacitor.

2500|$|In the <b>microwave</b> <b>region</b> of the {{electromagnetic}} spectrum, a waveguide normally consists of a hollow metallic conductor.

50|$|These {{molecules}} {{fall into}} two classes, according to symmetry: centrosymmetric molecules with point group D∞h, such as carbon dioxide, CO2, and ethyne or acetylene, HCCH; and non-centrosymmetric molecules with point group C∞v such as hydrogen cyanide, HCN, and nitrous oxide, NNO. Centrosymmetric linear molecules have a dipole moment of zero, so do not show a pure rotation spectrum in the infrared or <b>microwave</b> <b>regions.</b> On the other hand, in certain vibrational excited states the molecules do have a dipole moment so that a ro-vibrational spectrum {{can be observed in}} the infrared.|$|R

2500|$|The cosmic {{microwave}} background (CMB) is electromagnetic radiation left over from {{an early stage of}} the universe in Big Bang cosmology. In older literature, the CMB is also variously known as {{cosmic microwave}} background radiation (CMBR) or [...] "relic radiation". The CMB is a faint cosmic background radiation filling all space that is an important source of data on the early universe because it is the oldest electromagnetic radiation in the universe, dating to the epoch of recombination. With a traditional optical telescope, the space between stars and galaxies (the background) is completely dark. However, a sufficiently sensitive radio telescope shows a faint background noise, or glow, almost isotropic, that is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object. This glow is strongest in the <b>microwave</b> <b>region</b> of the radio spectrum. The accidental discovery of the CMB in 1964 by American radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s, and earned the discoverers the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E

40|$|Conducting {{polymers}} (CPs) display strong electrochromism {{across the}} visible, near-IR (NIR), IR and even <b>microwave</b> spectral <b>regions.</b> Applications range from military to space. However, a fundamental {{understanding of the}} phenomena behind this electrochromism, the charge carrier(s) responsible, and the relation of nanoscopic morphology and electrochemical properties to the electrochromism, still remains lacking. This paper takes a first step at such a correlation, mining a wealth of data accumulated {{over the course of}} many years by our group. Expected findings are that certain population states contribute predominantly to certain spectral regions (e. g. bipolaron states to the IR, the valence band to the visible and other mid-gap states to the microwave). Among more specific findings, a prominent 7 μ m (0. 16 eV) peak in MR devices is ascribed to bipolarons, whilst a low-energy transition at 0. 054 eV is ascribed to inter/intra-chain transitions. Other findings point to the potential design of very broad-band electrochromic systems encompassing the visible through <b>microwave</b> <b>regions...</b>|$|R
