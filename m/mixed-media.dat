5|$|Mellor's {{work was}} {{represented}} in the first National Indigenous Art Triennial in 2007, with the elaborate (and elaborately named) sculpture The contrivance of a vintage Wonderland (A magnificent flight of curious fancy for science buffs, a china ark of seductive whimsy, a divinely ordered special attraction, upheld in multifariousness) featuring a diorama that included sculpted kangaroos made with blue and white crockery fragments (evoking Spode bone china), real kangaroo skin (used for the ears and paws), and synthetic eyeballs; stuffed birds sat in a life-sized <b>mixed-media</b> tree overhead. The work featured in media reports of the exhibition, including by The Adelaide Advertiser, The Canberra Times, The West Australian and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Takemitsu was a {{founding}} member of the anti-academic : an artistic group established for multidisciplinary collaboration on <b>mixed-media</b> projects, who sought to avoid Japanese artistic tradition. The performances and works undertaken by the group introduced several contemporary Western composers to Japanese audiences. During this period he wrote Saegirarenai Kyūsoku I ("Uninterrupted Rest I", 1952: a piano work, without a regular rhythmic pulse or barlines); and by 1955 Takemitsu had begun to use electronic tape-recording techniques in such works as Relief Statique (1955) and Vocalism A·I (1956). Takemitsu also studied in the early 1950s with the composer Fumio Hayasaka, perhaps best known for the scores he wrote for films by Kenji Mizoguchi and Akira Kurosawa, the latter of whom Takemitsu would collaborate with decades later.|$|E

25|$|Ballpoint pens {{have proven}} to be a {{versatile}} art medium for professional artists as well as amateur doodlers. Low cost, availability, and portability are cited by practitioners as qualities which make this common writing tool a convenient, alternative art supply. Some artists use them within <b>mixed-media</b> works, while others use them solely as their medium-of-choice.|$|E
25|$|Jane Schenthal Frank (born Jane Babette Schenthal) (July 25, 1918 – May 31, 1986) was an American artist. She {{studied with}} Hans Hofmann and Norman Carlberg {{and is known}} as a painter, sculptor, mixed media artist, and textile artist. Her landscape-like, <b>mixed-media</b> {{abstract}} paintings are included in some important public collections, including those of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Baltimore Museum of Art, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum.|$|E
25|$|The 1937 Lobster Dress was {{a simple}} white silk evening dress with a crimson {{waistband}} featuring a large lobster painted (by Dalí) onto the skirt. From 1934, Dalí had started incorporating lobsters into his work, including New York Dream-Man Finds Lobster in Place of Phone shown in the magazine American Weekly in 1935, and the <b>mixed-media</b> Lobster Telephone (1936). His design for Schiaparelli was interpreted into a fabric print by the leading silk designer Sache. It was famously worn by Wallis Simpson {{in a series of}} photographs by Cecil Beaton taken at the Château de Candé shortly before her marriage to Edward VIII.|$|E
25|$|By the {{completion}} of the Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project in 2010, original artwork was installed in each of the 18 renovated stations along the CTA's Brown Line. By combining the visibility and accessibility of the city's mass transit system with the creativity of Chicago's art resources, this program resulted in a successful public display of professional works of art designed with input from nearby communities. This program provided high-profile locations for public art and server as a gateway to communities served by the CTA stations. Media under consideration included, but were not limited to, mosaics, art glass, ornamental fencing, <b>mixed-media</b> artwork, and freestanding sculpture and furniture.|$|E
25|$|Famous 20th-century {{artists such}} as Andy Warhol, among others, have {{utilised}} ballpoint pens to some extent during their careers. Ballpoint pen artwork continues to attract interest in the 21st century, with contemporary artists gaining recognition for their specific use of ballpoint pens; for their technical proficiency, imagination, and innovation. Korean-American artist Il Lee has been creating large-scale, ballpoint-only abstract artwork since the late 1970s. Since the 1980s, Lennie Mace creates imaginative, ballpoint-only artwork of varying content and complexity, applied to unconventional surfaces including wood and denim. The artist coined terms such as PENtings and Media Graffiti to describe his varied output. More recently, British artist James Mylne has been creating photo-realistic artwork using mostly black ballpoints, sometimes with minimal <b>mixed-media</b> color. In the mid-2000s (decade), Juan Francisco Casas generated Internet attention {{for a series of}} large-scale, photo-realistic ballpoint duplications of his own snapshots of friends, utilising only blue pens.|$|E
500|$|Deepan Sivaraman, noted scenographer and {{director}} from India, adapted the film into an hour-long <b>mixed-media</b> piece with the Performance Studies students at Ambedkar University Delhi {{as part of}} a course entitled [...] "Space and Spectatorship." [...] The performance took place in a run-down warehouse on the university campus and employed multimedia projection to create visual impact. The show premiered in February 2015 in Delhi.|$|E
500|$|As a post-black artist, his <b>mixed-media</b> work, {{such as his}} Spring 2008 {{exhibition}} The Dead Lecturer, {{plays on}} race while diminishing its significance by playing with contradictions, coded references and allusions (E.g., The New Negro Escapist Social and Athletic Club (Emmett), right). The exhibit was described as [...] "a fictional secret society of African-American intellectuals, a cross between Mensa and the Masons" [...] {{that that was a}} challenge to either condemn or endorse.|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{adapted the}} lyric for [...] "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" [...] from an 1843 poster for Pablo Fanque's circus that he {{purchased}} at an antique shop in Kent {{on the day}} of filming the promotional film for [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever". Womack views the track as an effective blending of a print source and music: [...] "The interpretive power of the <b>mixed-media</b> application accrues its meaning through the musical production with which the group imbues the Ur-text of the poster." [...] MacDonald notes Lennon's request for a [...] "fairground production wherein one could smell the sawdust", an atmosphere that Martin and Emerick attempted to create with a sound collage that comprised randomly assembled recordings of harmoniums, harmonicas and calliopes. MacDonald describes the song as [...] "a spontaneous expression of its author's playful hedonism". Everett thinks that the track's use of Edwardian imagery thematically links it with the album's opening number.|$|E
500|$|Dave McKean drew {{most of the}} {{principal}} art, {{as well as the}} cover art of the graphic novel. In illustrating the story, McKean blends paintings, drawings, photography, and <b>mixed-media</b> collage to come up with striking page designs, and dense symbols. He has said that he was [...] "trying to make the book despite the subject, rather than because of it. At the end of the day, if you really love to do Batman comics, then that's probably the best thing to do. Not liking them, and then trying to make something out of them is just a waste of time." [...] He also came to think that [...] "overpainted, lavish illustrations in every panel just didn't work. It hampers the storytelling." [...] McKean liberally uses symbolism, imagery, and surrealism, and many scenes involve the use of symbols to denote a particular psychological device. For example, a Greek inscription can be seen scratched on the doorway of Maxie Zeus's electroshock chamber, which translates into [...] "Discover thyself." [...] Much of this symbolism was later explained and expanded upon by the release of the 15th Anniversary Edition containing Morrison's annotated script.|$|E
500|$|Jarrell created many jazz tributes {{starting}} in the 1980s. Cookin' n Smokin (1986) {{is a tribute to}} jazz musician Oscar Peterson, who is shown playing piano with a sunburst design around his head. To the left of Peterson is bass player Ray Brown. Both figures have large heads, their faces have exaggerated features similar to African masks, and are described as being [...] "midpoint between naturalism and abstraction" [...] by Robert Douglas. The trowel is used throughout to blend color. Jazz Giants (1987), another jazz tribute, shows Dizzy Gillespie, Harry Carney, Johnny Hodges and Cootie Williams performing. Leaf patterns and circles common in Jarrell's work are seen throughout. The trowel is used to create recognizable portraits of the musicians, with the paint on a white background appearing as if a woodcut. Priestess (1988) depicts another jazz icon, Nina Simone, who appears twice - playing piano and singing solo, backed by a band. 1979's I Remember Bill is a memorial to Jarrell's friend guitarist Bill Harris, originally of The Clovers. [...] Jarrell occasionally traveled with Harris, hanging his paintings behind Harris as he performed. The painting is a large <b>mixed-media</b> polyptych of shaped canvas, and a painted six-stringed guitar sits {{on the top of the}} work. The painting features glued on photographs of Harris and two painted portraits of the musician, surrounded by Jarrell's signature symbols, designs and patterns.|$|E

2500|$|Hamilton also {{incorporated}} {{pieces of}} plastic directly into his collages. [...] In Pin-up (1961), a <b>mixed-media</b> work exploring the female nude, sculpted plastic {{was used for}} the breasts of the nude figure. $he (1959-1961) incorporated a plastic holographic eye, given to Hamilton by Herbert Ohl.|$|E
2500|$|Myst, {{released}} in 1993 by Cyan Worlds, {{is considered one}} of the genre's more influential titles. Myst included pre-rendered 3D graphics, video, and audio. Myst was an atypical game for the time, with no clear goals, little personal or object interaction, and a greater emphasis on exploration, and on scientific and mechanical puzzles. Part of the game's success was because it did not appear to be aimed at an adolescent male audience, but instead a mainstream adult audience. Myst held the record for computer game sales for seven years—it sold over nine million copies on all platforms, a feat not surpassed until the release of The Sims in 2000. In addition, Myst is considered to be the [...] "killer app" [...] that drove mainstream adoption of CD-ROM drives, as the game was one of the first to be distributed solely on CD-ROM, forgoing the option of floppy disks. Mysts successful use of <b>mixed-media</b> would lead to its own sequels, and other puzzle-based adventure games using <b>mixed-media</b> such as The 7th Guest. With many companies attempting to capitalize on the success of Myst, a glut of similar games followed its release, which contributed towards the start of the decline of the adventure game market in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] is {{a hybrid}} of text and {{graphical}} adventure games, typically featuring text-based story and interactivity aided by static or sprite-based visuals. They resemble <b>mixed-media</b> novels or tableau vivant stage plays. The format has its primary origins in Japanese and other Asian video game markets, typically for personal computers and more recently on handheld consoles or mobile devices. The format has not gained much traction in Western markets. A common type of visual novel are dating sims, which has the player attempt to improve a relationship {{with one or more}} other characters, such as Hatoful Boyfriend.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Krens, {{director}} of the foundation from 1988 to 2008, led a rapid expansion of the foundation's collections. [...] In 1991, he broadened the foundation's holdings by acquiring the Panza Collection. [...] Assembled by Count Giuseppe di Biumo and his wife, Giovanna, the Panza Collection includes examples of Minimalist sculptures by Carl Andre, Dan Flavin and Donald Judd, and Minimalist paintings by Robert Mangold, Brice Marden and Robert Ryman, {{as well as an}} array of Post-Minimal, Conceptual, and perceptual art by Robert Morris, Richard Serra, James Turrell, Lawrence Weiner and others, notably American examples of the 1960s and 1970s. [...] In 1992, the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation gifted 200 of his best photographs to the foundation. [...] The works spanned his entire output, from his early collages, Polaroids, portraits of celebrities, self-portraits, male and female nudes, flowers and statues. It also featured <b>mixed-media</b> constructions and included his well-known 1998 Self-Portrait. The acquisition initiated the foundation's photography exhibition program.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{his return}} to New York, Noguchi took a new studio in Greenwich Village. Throughout the 1940s, Noguchi's {{sculpture}} drew from the ongoing surrealist movement; these works include not only various <b>mixed-media</b> constructions and landscape reliefs, but lunars [...] self-illuminating reliefs [...] {{and a series of}} biomorphic sculptures made of interlocking slabs. The most famous of these assembled-slab works, Kouros, was first shown in a September 1946 exhibition, helping to cement his place in the New York art scene. In 1947 he began a relationship with Herman Miller of Zeeland, Michigan. This relationship was to prove very fruitful, resulting in several designs that have become symbols of the modernist style, including the iconic Noguchi table, which remains in production today. Noguchi also developed a relationship with Knoll, designing furniture and lamps. During this period he continued his involvement with theater, designing sets for Martha Graham's Appalachian Spring and John Cage and Merce Cunningham's production of The Seasons. [...] Near the end of his time in New York, he also found more work designing public spaces, including a commission for the ceilings of the Time-Life headquarters. In March 1949, [...] Noguchi had his first one-person show in New York since 1935 at the Charles Egan Gallery. In September 2003, The Pace Gallery held an exhibition of Noguchi's work at their 57th Street gallery. The exhibition, entitled 33 MacDougal Alley: The Interlocking Sculpture of Isamu Noguchi, featured eleven of the artist’s interlocking sculptures. This was the first exhibition to illustrate the historical significance of the relationship between MacDougal Alley and Isamu Noguchi’s sculptural work.|$|E

Hasbro released the first Scorpion figures in 1994: a 3.75" [...] version in which his mask was blue and he was packaged with a plastic scorpion accessory, then a twelve-inch figure whose design and packaged weaponry were {{more in line with}} the games. Toy Island distributed a Scorpion figure in 1996 as part of their MK Trilogy collection, which included a pair of hookswords, and Infinite Concepts put out a Scorpion figure in 1999. Jazwares released a 6" [...] Deception figure in 2005, and a 2006 Shaolin Monks figure that was also included as part of a Hot Topic-exclusive two-pack with Sub-Zero, in addition to a collection of figures in 2011: a 4" [...] figure from their MK2011 line, a [...] "Klassic" [...] four-incher, and a [...] "Retro" [...] figure that featured an interchangeable skull head and which was packaged with Sub-Zero, Reptile and Smoke in a box set.
