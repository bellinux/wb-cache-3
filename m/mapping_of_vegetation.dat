Gaussen was an early advocate of the ideas of stages and vegetation succession, which are fundamental to phytogeography. His work allowed for the production of a vegetation map of France at a scale of 1/200 000 (completed after his death by the service of the CNRS, but which he had created and directed) and many similar projects in other countries. His work led to many advanced phytogeographic tools such as [...] "Gaussen index", the [...] "xerothermic index" [...] and [...] "ombrothermic diagram [...] ".

40|$|<b>Mapping</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> {{patterns}} {{over large}} extents using remote sensing methods requires field sample collections for two different purposes: (1) {{the establishment of}} plant association classification systems from samples of relative abundance estimates; and (2) training for supervised image classification and accuracy assessment of satellite data derived maps.

Dune slacks are the major type of habitat and the most threatened in the Dutch dune belt. The influence of groundwater on dune slack vegetation is illustrated. The vegetation of dunes, especially of slacks, has been described by lists of species and vegetation maps in earlier publications. An explanation of methods used in such surveys, including floristic surveys and <b>mapping</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation,</b> is given. Comparison with historic records showed that slack vegetation deteriorated severely between 1850 and 1978. A fall in watertable was the main cause of the deterioration in vegetation of dune slacks near Bergen (NorthHolland). Studies there and elsewhere along the dune belt showed that even a small fall in watertable could cause considerable changes in vegetation, such as a fall in the number of phreatophytes. ...|$|E

The resulting regression analysis values were applied to the hyperspectral imagery (APEX). The classification results were compared to the supervised classification SVM (Support Vector Machine). The DCA method was able to explain 16, 3 % variation for the first three axes of the ordination analysis. Subsequent correlation with spectral data of vegetation showed that the highest confidence value reached the first axis correlated with field spectral data (R 2 = 0, 56).

40|$|A major {{challenge}} {{in the study of}} the earth system is the <b>mapping</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> quantities over large regions. Geostatistical methods, such as cokriging and stochastic simulation, have the potential to exploit more fully both remotely sensed data and ground information and improve the spatial estimation of vegetation variables over traditional regression methods. A synthetic example constructed from imaging spectrometer data allows a useful comparison among regression, cokriging and a simple probability-field method. A range of linear relationships between direct (sampled) and ancillary images is used. The lowest root-mean-square-error is achieved with cokriging until the correlation between direct and ancillary data exceeds. 89, at which point regression is the superior estimator. Probability-field simulation gives a range of possible realizations, most more precise than those from regression. The relationship between ground measurements and image data is thus demonstrated to be one of the critical factors in the choice of a spatial estimation method...|$|E

40|$|Traditional satellite-based <b>mapping</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{vegetation}}</b> {{vigor and}} amount {{is based on}} the way vegetation interacts with red and infrared light. Occasionally, however, those two signals are not enough. MODIS measures light reflected from Earth at a variety of wavelengths, and the Arizona researchers incorporate the additional information into their Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The EVI has increased sensitivity within very dense vegetation, and it has built-in corrections for several factors that can interfere with the satellite-based vegetation mapping, like smoke and background noise caused by light reflecting off soil. The bi-weekly and monthly vegetation index maps have wide usability by biologists, natural resources managers, and climate modelers. They can track naturally occurring fluctuations in vegetation, such as seasonal changes, as well as those that result from land use change, such as deforestation. The EVI can also monitor changes in vegetation resulting from climate change, such as expansion of deserts or extension of growing seasons.
