40|$|The {{generation}} of large-scale magnetic {{field in the}} kinematic regime {{in the absence of}} an alpha-effect is investigated by following two different approaches, namely the test-field method and multiscale stability theory relying on the homogenisation technique.

Our computations of the <b>magnetic</b> eddy <b>diffusivity</b> tensor for the specific instances of the parity-invariant flow-IV of G. O.

Finally, a new analytic result is presented: upon expressing the eddy diffusivity tensor in terms of solutions to auxiliary problems for the adjoint operator, we derive relations between <b>magnetic</b> eddy <b>diffusivity</b> tensors that arise for opposite small-scale flows v(x) and -v(x).

40|$|The Sun, {{aside from}} its 11 -year sunspot cycle, is {{additionally}} subject to long-term variation in its activity.

We compute the turbulent transport coefficients, describing {{the effects of the}} turbulent velocity field on the mean magnetic field, using the test-field method. The test-field analysis provides a plausible explanation of the missing cycle in terms of the reduction of αϕϕ in advance of the reduced surface activity and enhanced downward turbulent pumping during the event to confine some of the magnetic field {{at the bottom of the}} convection zone, where the local maximum of magnetic energy is observed during the event.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} with self-similar {{initial and}} boundary conditions provide {{a link between}} theoretical and numerical investigations of jet dynamics. We perform axisymmetric resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations for a generalised solution of the Blandford & Payne type, and compare them with the corresponding analytical and numerical ideal-MHD solutions. We disentangle {{the effects of the}} numerical and physical diffusivity. The latter could occur in outflows above an accretion disk, being transferred from the underlying disk into the disk corona by MHD turbulence (anomalous turbulent diffusivity), or as a result of ambipolar diffusion in partially ionized flows. We conclude that while the classical magnetic Reynolds number R_ m measures the importance of resistive effects in the induction equation, a new introduced number, =(β/ 2) R_ m with β the plasma beta, measures the importance of the resistive effects in the energy equation. Thus, in magnetised jets with β< 2, when 1 resistive effects are non-negligible and affect mostly the energy equation. The presented simulations indeed show that for a range of <b>magnetic</b> <b>diffusivities</b> corresponding to 1 the flow remains close to the ideal-MHD self-similar solution.

40|$|The {{existence}} of the solar tachocline, a thin differentially rotating layer {{at the base of}} the convection zone which is inferred from helioseismology, leads to the concept of an interface dynamo. The tachocline is magnetically coupled to the radiative interior and the overlying convection zone. A multilayered interface dynamo is required to describe the dynamo process involved. We first discuss a two-dimensional multilayered interface dynamo model in cartesian geometry consisting of four horizontal layers with different <b>magnetic</b> <b>diffusivities</b> magnetically coupled by the three sets of interface matching conditions for the generated magnetic field. Exact solutions of the coupled dynamo system are obtained in this model. We then discuss a fully three-dimensional and multi-layered spherical dynamic interface dynamo using a finite element method based on the three-dimensional tetrahedralization of the whole spherical system. The spherical dynamic interface dynamo also consists of four magnetically coupled zones. In the convection zone, the fully three-dimensional dynamic feedback of Lorentz forces is taken into account. It is shown that the dynamo is characterized by a strong toroidal magnetic field, selects dipolar symmetry and propagates equatorward. © 2008 International Astronomical Union. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
