Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly wrote that, although the band [...] "can still knock out a noisy punk stomper when the mood strikes" [...] like on the track [...] "Sleepin Around", the cleaner and quieter melodies are the ones that [...] "really rip up your emotions". Slants Jimmy Newlin stated similar pros, noting that [...] "quiet is the new loud", and felt that the band's shift towards romantic poignancy was [...] "a welcome growth as the band advances well into its second decade of existence".|$|E
500|$|... "Is It Scary" [...] {{generally}} received {{positive to}} mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. Jim Farber, {{writer for the}} New York Daily News, commented that [...] "Is It Scary' boasts a few innovative sounds but no real melodies". Roger Catlin of The Hartford Courant stated that [...] "the most intriguing pairing" [...] was [...] "Ghosts" [...] and [...] "Is It Scary" [...] because Jackson [...] "asks those who've only read about him in tabloids if he seems monstrous". Anthony , a writer for The Buffalo News, remarked that Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mixs songs [...] "Superfly Sister", [...] "Ghosts" [...] and [...] "Is It Scary" [...] were [...] "programmed plastic soul that <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> how someone as talented as Jackson can churn out such tracks".|$|E
500|$|Leslie Felprin of The Hollywood Reporter {{praised the}} film as an [...] "affecting if {{somewhat}} soft-soaped comedy drama, elevated by excellent performances." [...] The Reporter wrote that [...] "Emma Thompson takes charge of {{the central role of}} P. L. Travers with an authority that <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> how anybody else could ever have been considered." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety wrote that the film [...] "has all the makings of an irresistible backstage tale, and it's been brought to the screen with a surplus of old-fashioned Disney showmanship...", and that Tom Hanks's portrayal captured Walt Disney's [...] "folksy charisma and canny powers of persuasion— at once father, confessor and the shrewdest of businessmen." [...] Overall, he praised {{the film as}} [...] "very rich in its sense of creative people and their spirit of self-reinvention." ...|$|E

500|$|Mark Wright of The Stage commented overall {{that the}} episode was [...] "about as deliciously old-fashioned as new Who gets," [...] {{stating that the}} script was [...] "a deftly simple premise that <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> why you didn't think of it yourself", and that Tate's {{character}} {{moved away from the}} caricature in [...] "The Runaway Bride". Wright also praised Agyeman for [...] "effortlessly" [...] portraying Martha and her evil cloned counterpart. A fan of the Sontarans, Wright reacted positively to their return and redesign. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy rated the episode four stars out of five. Rawson-Jones felt the narrative was well plotted and paced, and felt Helen Raynor's writing had improved from [...] "Daleks in Manhattan". Rawson-Jones also praised the reintroductions of UNIT, Martha, Donna's family and the Sontarans, the interaction between Donna and Martha, and Christopher Ryan's portrayal of Staal, but felt Skorr's voice was [...] "distinctly lacklustre." [...] The episode's direction by Douglas Mackinnon also received criticism, particularly the scenes in the clone room. In the end, Rawson-Jones felt that the first part's effectiveness lies on how much the viewers wish to tune in to see [...] "The Poison Sky".|$|E

On 25 May, the DTRA issued the 5th Bomb Wing an [...] "unsatisfactory" [...] rating, the lowest rating possible, from the inspection. The 5th passed the inspection in nine of ten areas, but failed {{in the area of}} nuclear security. Following the inspection, Westa stated, [...] "Overall, their assessment painted a picture of some things we need to work on in the areas of training and discipline". The 5th Bomb Wing Security Forces Squadron Commander, Lieutenant Colonel John Worley, was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Weaver on 16 June 2008. In spite of failing the NSI, the wing kept its nuclear certification. Said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists about the 5th's failure in the inspection, [...] "It <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> what's going on elsewhere, like the nuclear weapons stationed at bases overseas, and at Barksdale Air Force Base and Whiteman Air Force Base."

So it's fitting that she wraps up the deluxe edition with the title track [...] Deep down, she does have a rebel heart— and you can't fault her for reminding us that pop music is all the better for it". Of the leaked demo, Daniel Welsh from The Huffington Post, wrote that [...] "it’s taken the best parts of Avicii’s sound and blended them with Madonna, rather than giving us an ear-assaulting [...] "Avicii feat.

Spin said it was the singer's [...] "sweetest melody since 'What It Feels Like for a Girl', with her register dropped an octave or two until it resembles the Liz Phair of 2005's (underrated) Somebody's Miracle". Q magazine called it a [...] "movingly autobiographical title track, where Madonna reflects at length on her career and her motivation.

500|$|Altogether, Ripken spent 36 {{years in}} the Baltimore Orioles organization, serving as a player, a scout, a coach, and a manager. He is remembered for helping bring about [...] "The Oriole Way", Baltimore's {{tradition}} of excellence. The Baltimore Sun wrote, [...] "Most Baltimore fans couldn't define the term exactly, but they liked that it implied reverence for the sport and {{the skills needed to}} play it well." [...] Elrod Hendricks, another longtime Oriole coach who kept in touch with Ripken throughout the years, said [...] "He was baseball and baseball was him." [...] Sam Perlozzo, who like Ripken spent many years as a third base coach, said [...] "When you were around him, you didn't say much. One reason was out of respect. The other was because you could learn from him, no matter how long you had been in the game." [...] Despite his 36 years with the organization, only a little more than one of them were as manager of the team, causing Thomas Boswell to write, [...] "The idea that a person could find deep satisfaction through fulfilling difficult responsibilities – while never focusing on personal rewards – seems antique these days. Yet Ripken's example <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> if the century, not Senior, has lost its way."

500|$|The {{critical}} {{reception of}} the character has been generally negative. Robert A. George of the New York Post has written that Glee has: [...] "the most unpleasant pack of female characters of any show in recent memory", and deemed Terri the [...] "biggest culprit". George called Terri's hysterical pregnancy [...] "Freudian" [...] and wrote: [...] "The Terri-Quinn plot sends {{the message that the}} devious gender will use every trick to lure and trap its mate — including lying about pregnancy." [...] Varietys Brian Lowry commented: [...] "Perhaps to foster a rooting interest (or at least sympathy) for a Will-Emma pairing, [...] (Jessalyn Gilsig) is initially presented as a ditsy shrew." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan has called Terri [...] "the worst thing about Glee", and opined: [...] "As written by Murphy and played by Gilsig, the character is screechy, unfunny and deeply unpleasant. It's as if Ryan didn't trust that the audience would get behind Will and the saga of his ragtag glee club and so saw fit to give the teacher the shrewish, nagging wife from hell." [...] Ryan later deemed Terri the [...] "one big flaw in Glee, commenting that she: [...] "manages to drain all the fun out of Glee every time she appears. Not only is this shrill character intensely annoying, but she <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> whether Will has brain damage. What other explanation could there be for his ending up with this materialistic harpy?". Furthermore, Terri was included in TV Guide list of The Most Loathed TV Characters.|$|E
500|$|In its DVD Reviews section, EWs Chris Nashawaty {{gave the}} film an A-minus, stating, [...] "Depp's soaring voice <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> what other tricks he's been hiding... Watching Depp's barber wield his razors... it's {{hard not to}} be {{reminded}} of Edward Scissorhands frantically shaping hedges into animal topiaries 18 years ago... and all of the twisted beauty we would've missed out on had [...] never met." [...] In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers awarded it 3½ out of 4 stars and added, [...] "Sweeney Todd is a thriller-diller from start to finish: scary, monstrously funny and melodically thrilling... is a bloody wonder, intimate and epic, horrific and heart-rending as it flies on the wings of Sondheim's most thunderously exciting score." [...] As with Time, the critic ranked it fifth on his list of the best movies of 2007. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "The blood juxtaposed to the music is highly unsettling. It runs contrary to expectations. Burton pushes this gore into his audiences' faces so as to feel the madness and the destructive fury of Sweeney's obsession. Teaming with Depp, his long-time alter ego, Burton makes Sweeney a smoldering dark pit of fury and hate that consumes itself. With his sturdy acting and surprisingly good voice, Depp is a Sweeney Todd for the ages." [...] Harry Knowles gave the film a highly positive review, calling it Burton's best film since Ed Wood, his favorite Burton film, and said it was possibly superior. He praised all of the cast and the cinematography, but noted it would probably not appeal to non-musical fans due to the dominance of music in the film.|$|E

2500|$|Anthony Violenti of The Buffalo News said of {{the lead}} single, [...] " [...] laced with Teddy Riley's new jack swing sound and a {{pounding}} techno beat". Violenti added, [...] "'Superfly Sister', 'Ghosts' and 'Is It Scary' are programmed plastic soul that <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> how someone as talented as Jackson can churn out such tracks". He said of [...] "Morphine", [...] " [...] has more synthesized beats and quickly fades into Jackson's current indistinguishable style". William Ruhlman of AllMusic {{said of the}} lead track, [...] "'Blood on the Dance Floor' is an uptempo Jackson song in the increasingly hysterical tradition of 'Billie Jean' and 'Smooth Criminal' with Jackson huffing, puffing, and yelping through some nonsense about a stabbing...over a fairly generic electronic dance track." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine, also of AllMusic, had a negative reaction to the record. He said that all five new tracks were, [...] "embarrassingly weak, sounding tired, predictable and, well, bloodless". He described [...] "Blood on the Dance Floor" [...] as a [...] "bleak reworking of 'Jam' and 'Scream'".|$|E
2500|$|Rather than {{attempt to}} {{reproduce}} his subjects, Lichtenstein's work tackled {{the way in}} which the mass media portrays them. He would never take himself too seriously, however, saying: [...] "I think my work is different from comic strips -- but I wouldn't call it transformation; I don't think that whatever is meant by it is important to art." [...] When Lichtenstein's work was first exhibited, many art critics of the time challenged its originality. His work was harshly criticized as vulgar and empty. The title of a Life magazine article in 1964 asked, “Is He the Worst Artist in the U.S.?” Lichtenstein responded to such claims by offering responses such as the following: [...] "The closer my work is to the original, the more threatening and critical the content. However, my work is entirely transformed in that my purpose and perception are entirely different. I think my paintings are critically transformed, but it would be difficult to prove it by any rational line of argument." [...] He discussed experiencing this heavy criticism in an interview with April Bernard and Mimi Thompson in 1986. Suggesting that it was at times difficult to be criticized, Lichtenstein said, “I don’t doubt when I’m actually painting, it’s the criticism that <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder,</b> it does.” ...|$|E

Burton had first given him an original cast recording of the [...] in 2000, and although not a fan of the musical genre, Depp had grown to like the tale's treatment. He cited Peter Lorre in Mad Love (1935) as his main influence for the role. Although he had performed in musical groups, Depp was initially unsure that {{he would be able to}} perform the role, which required him to sing. He recorded demos and worked with Bruce Witkin to shape his vocals without a qualified voice coach. In the DVD Reviews section, Entertainment Weeklys Chris Nashawaty gave the film an A minus, stating, [...] "Depp's soaring voice <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> what other tricks he's been hiding... Watching Depp's barber wield his razors... it's hard not to be reminded of Edward Scissorhands frantically shaping hedges into animal topiaries 18 years ago... and all of the twisted beauty we would've missed out on had [...] never met."

[...] Team manager Hill Brannon remembered one of Woodruff's many Yogi Berra-esque pre-game exhortations as [...] "Remember, the team that makes the fewest mistakes, makes the fewest mistakes."

5000|$|However, Green Day was {{slightly}} {{criticized for not}} progressing {{as much as their}} predecessors. Entertainment Weekly stated that: [...] "Insomniac does <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> about Green Days growth, though. Between albums one and four, The Clash, to take an old-school example, branched out from guitar crunch to reggae, dub, and Spectorized pop. By comparison, Green Day sound exactly the same as on their first album, albeit with crisper production and, ominously, a palpable degeneration in their sense of humor. The few hints of growth are fairly microscopic: a tougher metallic edge to a few of the songs ... and lyrics that are bleaker than Dookies." ...|$|R

All of which are way more poignant than raps about how dope she is." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian gave the song a negative review commenting on Minaj's tone, stating [...] "she sounds bored rigid, which rather <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> where showing off one's musical versatility ends and cravenly softening your sound for the marketplace begins." [...] Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork commented on the songs status on the album and how Minaj was out-shined by its collaborator, stating [...] "Minaj is upstaged by Drake and Kanye West on [...] "Moment 4 Life" [...] and [...] "Blazin'", respectively, but these tracks—plus the Rihanna collaboration [...] "Fly" [...] and the solo ballad [...] "Save Me"—are {{the best examples of}} what Pink Friday is rather than what many of us wanted it to be." [...] Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine gave the song a negative review on Minaj's part of the song and on the album as a whole, stating [...] "Minaj's deranged wildness could potentially provide a foil for Drake, cutting into his tendency to work slowly and calmly on [...] "Moment 4 Life." [...] Instead, Minaj backs off from an early round of forcefulness, letting Drake dictate the pace of the song. It's this seeming lack of confidence, contradictory to the poise she shows elsewhere, which identifies the problems with Pink Friday, an often wobbly first effort that shows enormous promise." ...|$|E
