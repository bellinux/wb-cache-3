He {{regularly}} {{played football}} in the backyard with two friends, Nelso and Pierpaolo, as a child. All three dreamed of becoming footballers, but only Alessandro would eventually manage to do so. Alessandro's older brother, Stefano, briefly played professional football for Sampdoria before an injury curtailed his career; he later worked as Alessandro's agent. The family lived in the hamlet of Saccon, a rural home in San Vendemiano. While growing up, Del Piero's family did not have <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> travelling abroad, so he considered being a lorry driver in order to see the world.|$|E

25|$|Attempts to {{purchase}} the bridge from the toll company were numerous in the 1930s and 1940s. A bill was defeated in 1931 by Governor of New York Franklin Delano Roosevelt that would have authorized the state to investigate purchasing the bridge. Roosevelt vetoed the bill, stating that the New York State Department of Public Works can choose to investigate without a legislated act. The state made an effort in 1933 which was unsuccessful. In 1937, the village of Waverly made an unsuccessful attempt to have the bridge bought by the state as part of construction of a road out of Waverly to improve connections. By July 1, 3,000 people had a signed a petition to have the structure purchased that would be delivered to Governor Thomas Dewey. The state declined the petition however, citing that the bridge company wanted too <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> the transaction.|$|E

500|$|His {{interest}} in psychology began when his sister Eunice committed suicide, {{because of the}} issue of depression. [...] He received a letter from Eunice's husband in August 1829, which told of her death. [...] Todd had thought he had cured her, multiple times, but she still had episodes, and when she had to attend to a large farm in empty Vermont alone, she was pushed over the edge. This began his theory that mental retardation (insanity at the time) was a disease and had a cause and possibly a cure. This began his revolutionary treatments, and what made the government give so <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> the mental hospital to be built.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{cast and crew}} {{associated}} with the series, including actor Michael Biehn, previous director James Cameron, and novelist Alan Dean Foster, expressed their frustration and disappointment with the film's story.

The feat of two hat-tricks in an innings has been repeated only once in first-class cricket, by Joginder Rao).

In addition, Herzog felt that shooting Aguirre in English would improve the film's chances for international distribution. However, the small amount of money that had been set aside for post-synchronization [...] "left Peru with {{the man in charge of}} the process; both absconded en route." [...] The English-language track was ultimately replaced by a higher-quality German language version, which was post-synched after production was completed. Herzog claims that Kinski requested too <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> the dubbing session, and so his lines were performed by another actor.|$|E

2500|$|One of Burnand's biggest successes, both in Punch and on stage, was satire of the {{aesthetic}} movement. His play The Colonel (1881), based on The Serious Family, a play by Morris Barnett, ran for 550 performances and toured extensively. It made so <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> the actor-manager Edgar Bruce {{that he was able}} to build the Prince of Wales Theatre. Burnand rushed The Colonel into production to make sure that it opened several months before Gilbert and Sullivan's similarly themed comic opera, Patience, but Patience ran even longer than The Colonel. Oscar Wilde, no fan of Burnand's farces, wrote, in anticipation of seeing Patience: [...] "With Gilbert and Sullivan I am sure we will have something better than the dull farce of The Colonel". For the Gaiety Theatre, Burnand wrote a burlesque of The Tempest entitled Ariel in October 1883, with music by Meyer Lutz, starring Nellie Farren and Arthur Williams. The Times complained of the [...] "flatness and insipidity" [...] of Burnand's text and of his vulgarising the original. The Observer was less censorious, finding the piece moderately amusing, and correctly predicting that it would run successfully until it had to make way for the annual Gaiety pantomime at Christmas.|$|E
2500|$|The New Deal {{programs}} put {{millions of}} Americans immediately {{back to work}} or at least helped them to survive. The programs were not specifically targeted to alleviate the much higher unemployment rate of blacks. Some aspects of the programs were even unfavorable to blacks. The Agricultural Adjustment Acts for example helped farmers which were predominantly white but reduced the need of farmers to hire tenant farmers or sharecroppers which were predominantely black. While the AAA stipulated that a farmer had to share the payments with those who worked the land this policy was never enforced. The Farm Service Agency (FSA), a government relief agency for tenant farmers, created in 1937, made efforts to empower African Americans by appointing them to agency committees in the South. Senator James F. Byrnes of South Carolina raised opposition to the appointments because he stood for white farmers who were threatened by an agency that could organize and empower tenant farmers. Initially, the FSA stood behind their appointments, but after feeling national pressure FSA was forced to release the African Americans of their positions. The goals of the FSA were notoriously liberal and not cohesive with the southern voting elite. Some New Deal measures inadvertently discriminated against harmed blacks. Thousands of blacks were thrown {{out of work and}} replaced by whites on jobs where they were paid less than the NRA's wage minimums because some white employers considered the NRA's minimum wage [...] "too <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> Negroes." [...] By August 1933, blacks called the NRA the [...] "Negro Removal Act." [...] An NRA study found that the NIRA put 500,000 African Americans out of work.|$|E
2500|$|In 1961, Cepeda {{had what}} he {{considers}} the best statistics of his career. He {{led the league in}} RBIs (142), home runs (46) and home run average (7.9). He was once again selected to play in the All-Star Game starting lineup. The Giants led the National League in runs scored, while the pitching staff had a collective earned run average of 3.77. The team finished in third place in the National League. Cepeda finished second in the Most Valuable Player voting, after Frank Robinson. After the season, Cepeda who at the moment was earning $30,000, asked for a $20,000 raise based on his performance. The general manager believed that he was making too <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> a fourth-year player, and the negotiations continued until a final salary of $46,000 was settled on. The 1962 Giants were an improved team. They constantly rivaled the Dodgers for the league lead. Several players from the team, including Cepeda, participated in the All-Star Games. Finishing tied with the Dodgers, the Giants played against them in a playoff series to determine the National League's champion. They won the best of three series 2–1. The team advanced to the World Series to face the New York Yankees. New York won in a seven-game series. Cepeda batted [...]306, with 35 home runs and 114 RBIs. In 1961 and 1962, Cepeda had strong years; however, he had serious problems with the team's manager Alvin Dark, to the point of almost skipping some games. Among the things that Dark did after being named manager was to order the Latin American players to stop speaking Spanish in the clubhouse. Cepeda immediately confronted him; after this Dark avoided summoning the Hispanic players to any team meeting.|$|E

2500|$|Interpreting the {{prohibition}} of coveting in [...] (20:14 in NJSP) and desiring in [...] (5:18 in NJPS), Maimonides taught that any person who covets a servant, a maidservant, a house, or utensils that belong to a colleague, or any other article that the person can purchase from the colleague and pressures the colleague with friends and requests until the colleague agrees to sell, violates a negative commandment, even though the person pays <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> it, as [...] (20:14 in NJSP) says, [...] "Do not covet." [...] Maimonides taught that the violation of this commandment was not punished by lashes, {{because it does not}} involve a deed. Maimonides taught that a person does not violate [...] (20:14 in NJSP) until the person actually takes the article that the person covets, as reflected by [...] "Do not covet the gold and silver on these statues and take it for yourself." [...] Maimonides read the word for [...] "covet" [...] in both [...] (20:14 in NJSP) and [...] to refer to coveting accompanied by a deed. Maimonides taught that a person who desires a home, a spouse, utensil, or anything else belonging to a colleague that the person can acquire violates a negative commandment when the person thinks in the person's heart how {{it might be possible to}} acquire this thing from the colleague. Maimonides read [...] (5:18 in NJPS), [...] "Do not desire," [...] to refer even to feelings in the heart alone. Thus, a person who desires another person's property violates one negative commandment. A person who purchases an object the person desires after pressuring the owners and repeatedly asking them, violates two negative commandments. For that reason, Maimonides concluded, the Torah prohibits both desiring in [...] (5:18 in NJPS) and coveting in [...] (20:14 in NJSP). And if the person takes the article by robbery, the person violates three negative commandments.|$|E
