MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page.

We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there.

Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all <b>makes</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>sense,</b> and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong.

Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music.
