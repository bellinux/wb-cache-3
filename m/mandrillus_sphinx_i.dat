Using a degenerate consensus primer PCR method for the herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene, the presence of KSHV homologues has been investigated in two semi-free-ranging colonies of eight drill (Mandrillus leucophaeus), five mandrill (<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>sphinx),</b> and two hybrid (<b>Mandrillus</b> leucophaeus-Mandrillus <b>sphinx)</b> monkeys, living in Cameroon and Gabon, Central Africa.

In such species, the vasodilatory effects of estradiol may cause red facial coloration to change systematically during females‚Äô ovarian cycle. Although increased red facial coloration during estrus has been observed in female mandrills (<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>sphinx)</b> and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), evidence linking primate facial color changes directly to changes in measured estradiol is lacking. Addressing this issue, we used a longitudinal design to demonstrate that red facial coloration tracks within-subject changes in women's estradiol, but not within-subject changes in women's progesterone or estradiol-to-progesterone ratio. Moreover, the relationship between estradiol and facial redness was observed in two independent samples of women (N= 50 and N= 65).

40|$|Abstract. Mandrills (<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>sphinx)</b> {{experimentally}} {{infected with}} human Loa loa usually remain microfilar-emic {{for a long}} period of time. Nevertheless some control their microfilaremia while still harboring adults worms, and therefore become occult-infected. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, targeted on the repeat 3 region of the gene coding for the L. loa 15 -kD protein (15 r 3 -PCR), has been evaluated in mandrills infected with third-stage larvae (L 3) of L. loa. The results of this assay were negative during the prepatency period (4 months after inoculation), but became positive when microfilariae appeared in the blood, and remained positive in all mandrills, even in those that became amicrofilaremic. These results show that the positivity of the 15 r 3 -PCR assay is linked to the appearance of microfilariae in peripheral blood and demonstrated that L. loa-specific DNA can be detected in blood from occult-infected mandrills. Loa loa is a filarial parasite transmitted by tabanid flies that is limited to the rain forest of central and west Africa. 1 This parasite has been estimated to cause chronic infection in as many as 13 million people.

We used two estimators of genetic diversity to explore the relationship between heterozygosity and reproductive success in male and female mandrills (<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>sphinx)</b> living in a semifree ranging setting in Gabon. Because social rank is known to influence reproductive success in both sexes, we also examined the correlation between genetic diversity and social rank in females, and acquisition of alpha status in males, as well as length of alpha male tenure. We found that heterozygous individuals showed greater reproductive success, with both females and males producing more offspring. However, heterozygosity influenced reproductive success only in dominant males, not in subordinates. Neither the acquisition of alpha status in males, nor social rank in females, was significantly correlated with heterozygosity, although more heterozygous alpha males showed longer tenure than homozygous ones. We also tested whether the benefits of greater genetic diversity were due mainly to a genome-wide effect of inbreeding depression or to heterosis at {{one or a few}} loci. Multilocus effects best explained the correlation between heterozygosity and reproductive success and tenure, indicating the occurrence of inbreeding depression in this mandrill colony...|$|R

Part of the study site included gallery forests within savanna areas, allowing observation of entire hordes, hitherto impossible in dense forest habitat. Horde size and composition (sex and age classes) were documented using exact records on video film whenever a horde or subgroup crossed an open space. Mean horde size was 620, and hordes of up to 845 individuals were documented, probably the largest stable group size found in any wild, unprovisioned primate population. Hordes were cohesive throughout the study period and {{did not seem to}} be aggregations of smaller units. Mandrill societies seem to be quite different from the baboon societies, to which they have been compared to date. Mature, breeding-age males were not resident members of hordes, but entered at the onset of seasonal cycles in the females (as deduced by the presence of sexual tumescence) and emigrated once female sexual cycles ceased. The number of breeding males present in the horde at any one time is best explained by the number of sexually attractive females. It is postulated that the extreme coloration of males and strong sexual dimorphism in mandrills may have evolved through an enhanced need for competitive signals in a situation where no long-term social bonds between breeding partners exist...|$|R

However, few studies have investigated MHC-mediated post-copulatory mate choice under natural, or even semi-natural, conditions. We set out to explore this question in a large semi-free-ranging population of mandrills (<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>sphinx)</b> using MHC-DRB genotypes for 127 parent‚Äìoffspring triads. First, we showed that offspring MHC heterozygosity correlates positively with parental MHC dissimilarity suggesting that mating among MHC dissimilar mates is efficient in increasing offspring MHC diversity. Second, we compared the haplotypes of the parental dyad {{with those of the}} offspring to test whether post-copulatory sexual selection favored offspring with two different MHC haplotypes, more diverse gamete combinations, or greater within-haplotype diversity. Limited statistical power meant that we could only detect medium or large effect sizes. Nevertheless, we found no evidence for selection for heterozygous offspring when parents share a haplotype (large effect size), genetic dissimilarity between parental haplotypes (we could detect an odds ratio of ‚â• 1. 86), or within-haplotype diversity (medium-large effect). These findings suggest that comparing parental and offspring haplotypes may be a useful approach to test for post-copulatory selection when matings cannot be observed, {{as is the case in}} many study systems.

Although many animals rely on multicomponent signals to communicate, the selective pressures shaping these signals are still poorly understood. Previous work has mainly investigated the evolution of multicomponent signals by studying each trait individually, which may not accurately reflect the selective pressures exerted by the holistic perception of signal receivers. Here, we study {{the design of the}} multicoloured face of an Old World primate, the mandrill (<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>sphinx),</b> in relation to two aspects of signalling that are expected to be selected by receivers: conspicuousness and information. Using reflectance data on the blue and red colours of the faces of 34 males and a new method of hue vectorisation in a perceptual space of colour vision, we show that the blue hue maximises contrasts to both the red hue and the foliage background colouration, thereby increasing the conspicuousness of the whole display. We further show that although blue saturation, red saturation and the contrast between blue and red colours are all correlated with dominance, dominance is most accurately indicated by the blue-red contrast. Taken together our results suggest that the evolution of blue and red facial colours in male mandrills are not independent and are likely driven by the holistic perception of conspecifics. In this view, we propose that the multicoloured face of mandrills acts as a multicomponent signal. Last, we show that information accuracy increases with th...|$|R

Although SIV and other primate retroviruses infect laboratory workers and zoo workers, zoonotic retrovirus transmission has not been documented in natural settings. We investigated zoonotic infection in individuals living in central Africa. Methods We obtained behavioural data, plasma samples, and peripheral blood lymphocytes from individuals living in rural villages in Cameroon. We did serological testing, PCR, and sequence analysis to obtain evidence of retrovirus infection. Findings Zoonotic infections with simian foamy virus (SFV), a retrovirus endemic in most Old World primates, were identified in people living in central African forests who reported direct contact with blood and body fluids of wild non-human primates. Ten (1 %) of 1099 individuals had antibodies to SFV. Sequence analysis from these individuals revealed three geographically-independent human SFV infections, each of which was acquired from a distinct non-human primate lineage: De Brazza's guenon (Cercopithecus neglectus), mandrill (<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>sphinx),</b> and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), two of which (De Brazza's guenon and mandrill) are naturally infected with SIV. Interpretation Our findings show that retroviruses are actively crossing into human populations, and demonstrate that people in central Africa are currently infected with SFV.

Peeled polygons and fixed kernel contours revealed multiple centres of use, with the horde spending more than half its time in < 10 % of the total documented range, typical of a frugivore using a patchy environment.

Next, I focus on male-male competition and female choice, followed by the less well-studied questions of female-female competition and male choice. This review shows how different reproductive priorities lead to very different life histories and divergent adaptations in males and females. It demonstrates how broadening traditional perspectives on sexual selection beyond the ostentatious results of intense sexual selection on males leads to an understanding of more subtle and cryptic forms of competition and choice in both sexes and opens many productive avenues in the study of primate reproductive strategies. These include the potential for studies of postcopulatory selection, female intrasexual competition, and male choice. These studies of mandrills provide comparison and, I hope, inspiration for studies of both other polygynandrous species and species with mating systems less traditionally associated with sexual selection...|$|R
