5|$|Diagnosis of a {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leak is performed {{through a combination}} of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography <b>myelogram</b> (CTM) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in the spinal canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. Once the pressure is measured, a radiocontrast agent is injected into the spinal fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several {{studies have}} been {{undertaken}} to validate quanti-tative methods of evaluating cervical spinal stenosis. This study was performed to assess the degree of interobserver and intraobserver agreement in the qualitative evaluation of cervical spinal stenosis on CT <b>myelograms</b> and MR images. METHODS: Cervical MR images and CT <b>myelograms</b> of 38 patients were evaluated retro-spectively. Six neuroradiologists with various backgrounds and training independently assessed the level, degree, and cause of stenosis on either MR images or CT <b>myelograms.</b> Unknown to the evaluators, 16 of the patients were evaluated twice to determine intraobserver variability. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement among the radiologists with regard to level, degree, and cause of stenosis on CT <b>myelograms</b> showed values of 0. 50, 0. 26, and 0. 32, respectively, and on MR images showed values of 0. 60, 0. 31, and 0. 22, respectively. Intraobserver agreement with regard to level, degree, and cause of stenosis on CT <b>myelograms</b> showed mean values of 0. 69, 0. 41, and 0. 55, respectively, and on MR images showed mean values of 0. 80, 0. 37, and 0. 40, respectively.

40|$|Three {{patients}} with cervical radicular symptoms and normal metrizamide <b>myelograms</b> underwent thin-section high-resolution computed tomographic scanning {{because of a}} strong clinical suspicion of herniated disk. Herniated disk was demonstrated in all three cases. In two, the disk protrusions were recognized only by computed tomographic myelography, and in the third case, the diagnosis was made with plain computed tomography and confirmed by computed tomographic myelography. Traditionally, confirmation of clinically suspected cervical disk disease has been sought by Pantopaque or plain-film metrizamide myelography [1, 2]. Recently computed tomography (CT) {{has been used to}} demonstrate cervical disk disease in {{patients with}} suspicious <b>myelograms</b> [3]. CT myelography is a technique in which spinal CT is combined with the intrathecal administration of metrizamide. Since its first description, this procedure has been used in a large number of disorders of the spinal canal and its contents [4, 5]. We present three patients with signs and symptoms of a cervical radiculopathy who had negative metrizamide <b>myelograms,</b> positive CT <b>myelograms,</b> and operative findings of soft herniate...|$|R
40|$|In a {{prospective}} study, patients with known malignant disease who were {{suspected of having}} a spinal epidural metastasis, had myelography which was {{not confined to the}} clinically suspected site, but included at least the whole lumbar and thoracic spinal canal. Fifty four of the 106 <b>myelograms</b> revealed at least one epidural metastasis. Twelve of these 54 <b>myelograms</b> showed two separate lesions, and four <b>myelograms</b> showed three separate lesions. In all 16 cases with multiple lesions {{at least one of the}} lesions was asymptomatic at the time of the diagnosis. It is concluded that multiple spinal epidural metastases are of common occurrence and occur in about one third of the cases. This finding may have important clinical implications. Examination of the spinal canal for epidural metastases should not be confined to the clinically suspected site, but should include as extensive an area as possible of the spinal canal, whatever technique is to be used...|$|R

40|$|This {{prospective}} study evaluated {{the usefulness of}} myelography in breast cancer patients who present with radiculopathy or myelopathy. A total of 124 consecutive <b>myelograms</b> were performed in 100 patients. Epidural metastasis (EM) was diagnosed in 67 <b>myelograms</b> (54 %). Multiple epidural metastases were diagnosed in 15 (22 %) of those, {{resulting in a total}} of 87 epidural lesions. A complete block was found in 13 EM (15 %) and an incomplete block in 14 EM (16 %). Clinical data could not predict the site of EM in 29 cases (33 %). Fifteen asymptomatic EM were detected in <b>myelograms</b> with multiple EM. Plain radiographs were of no value in determining the site of EM in 29 cases (33 %), including 13 cases (15 %) without vertebral metastasis at the site of EM. Treatment consisted of radiotherapy (RT) with or without systemic treatment in 52 cases (80 %), systemic treatment alone in 11 cases (17 %) and surgery in two patients (3 %). Clinical improvement was noticed in 72 %, no change in 13 %, and deterioration in 15 %. No difference in response was noticed between RT and systemic therapy. Before treatment 21 % and after treatment 15 % of the patients could not walk. The one year survival was 42 %. The ambulatory status at presentation was the most important prognostic factor. Examination of the spinal fluid, obtained at myelography, disclosed meningeal carcinomatosis in 9 % of the patients. Imaging of the whole spinal canal with cytological examination of the spinal fluid is recommended in breast cancer patients suspected of epidural tumour with features of radiculopathy or myelopathy, irrespective of further clinical data and plain spinal radiographs...|$|R

5000|$|Wobbler {{disease is}} {{probably}} inherited in the Borzoi, Great Dane, Doberman, and Basset Hound. Instability of the vertebrae {{of the neck}} (usually the caudal neck) causes spinal cord compression. In younger dogs such as Great Danes {{less than two years}} of age, wobbler disease is caused by stenosis (narrowing) of the vertebral canal [...] related to degeneration of the dorsal articular facets and subsequent thickening of the associated joint capsules and ligaments. A high-protein diet may contribute to its development. In middle-aged and older dogs such as Dobermans, intervertebral disc disease leads to bulging of the disc or herniation of the disc contents, and the spinal cord is compressed. In Great Danes, the C4 to C6 vertebrae are most commonly affected; in Dobermans, the C5 to C7 vertebrae are affected. The disease tends to be gradually progressive. Symptoms such as weakness, ataxia, and dragging of the toes start in the rear legs. Dogs often have a crouching stance with a downward flexed neck. The disease progresses to the front legs, but the symptoms are less severe. Neck pain is sometimes seen. Symptoms are usually gradual in onset, but may progress rapidly following trauma. X-rays may show misaligned vertebrae and narrow disk spaces, but it is not as effective as a <b>myelogram,</b> which reveals stenosis of the vertebral canal. Magnetic resonance imaging {{has been shown to be}} more effective at showing the location, nature, and severity of spinal cord compression than a <b>myelogram.</b> Treatment is either medical to control the symptoms, usually with corticosteroids and cage rest, or surgical to correct the spinal cord compression. The prognosis is guarded in either case. Surgery may fully correct the problem, but it is technically difficult and relapses may occur. Types of surgery include ventral decompression of the spinal cord (ventral slot technique), dorsal decompression, and vertebral stabilization. One study showed no significant advantage to any of the common spinal cord decompression procedures. Another study showed that electroacupuncture may be a successful treatment for Wobbler disease. [...] A new surgical treatment using a proprietary medical device has been developed for dogs with disc-associated wobbler disease. It implants an artificial disc (cervical arthroplasty) in place of the affected disc space.|$|E
5000|$|Removal of a disc at {{one level}} can lead to disc {{herniation}} at a different level at a later time. Even the most complete surgical excision of the disc still leaves 30-40% of the disc, which cannot be safely removed. This retained disc can re-herniate sometime after surgery. Virtually every major structure in the abdomen and the posterior retroperitoneal space has been injured, at some point, by removing discs using posterior laminectomy/discectomy surgical procedures. The most prominent of these is a laceration of the left internal iliac vein, which lies {{in close proximity to}} the anterior portion of the disc. In some studies, recurrent pain in the same radicular pattern or a different pattern can be as high as 50% after disc surgery. [...] Many observers have noted that {{the most common cause of}} a failed back syndrome is caused from recurrent disc herniation at the same level originally operated. A rapid removal in a second surgery can be curative. The clinical picture of a recurrent disc herniation usually involves a significant pain-free interval. However, physical findings may be lacking, and a good history is necessary. [...] The time period for the emergence of new symptoms can be short or long. Diagnostic signs such as the straight leg raise test may be negative even if real pathology is present. The presence of a positive <b>myelogram</b> may represent a new disc herniation, but can also be indicative of a post operative scarring situation simply mimicking a new disc. Newer MRI imaging techniques have clarified this dilemma somewhat. [...] Conversely, a recurrent disc can be difficult to detect in the presence of post op scarring. Myelography is inadequate to completely evaluate the patient for recurrent disc disease, and CT or MRI scanning is necessary. Measurement of tissue density can be helpful.|$|E

In chronic glomerulonephritis there was the intermediate pattern of the two. From the results obtained, it is most likely that renal anemia results from the deleterious effects upon bone marrow hematopoiesis, particularly upon erythropoiesis of the noxious substances present in azotemia.
