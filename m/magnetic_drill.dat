40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{fields in the}} deepest oceanic drill hole, DSDP/ODP Hole 504 B, and in the neighboring Hole 896 A, have been logged continuously with a calibrated three-axis magnetometer so that horizontal and vertical field anomalies could be deter-mined. The extrusive basalts produce the largest anomalies (up to 5000 nT) but the amplitudes vary strongly with short wave-lengths, whereas the sheeted dikes are associated with 500 to 1500 nT anomalies. The horizontal anomalies are predominantly negative and confirm the inferred inverse polarity of the drilled oceanic crust. At {{the base of the}} extrusives (oceanic Layer 2 A) there are positive anomalies, presumably from basalts with normal magnetization. However, steeply dipping layers with inverse polarity could also cause positive anomalies. The vertical extent of negative anomalies in Layer 2 A is only 200 m for Hole 896 A and 475 m for Hole 504 B, indicating a strong lateral variability in the thickness of this source layer. The fine struc-tures of the anomalies in both holes bear little resemblance to each other but the average amplitudes of the horizontal anomalies are both around 2000 nT in the upper parts. Simple forward models as horizontal cylinders allow us to determine average mag-netization values of 3 A/m for the extrusive basalts and 1. 7 A/m for the sheeted dikes (Layer 2 B). The former is only half the average measured rock magnetization, whereas sheeted dike values agree. At depths that correspond to the transitions in drill-ing from Legs 111 / 137 and 140 / 148 there are clear changes in the horizontal anomalies. These are inteΦreted as a result of drilling-induced magnetizations caused by strongly <b>magnetic</b> <b>drill</b> pipes used during Legs 137 and 140. The deduced average magnetization intensities have been used as parameters to model surface anomalies. Layers 2 A and 2 B contribute approxi-mately equally to the surface anomalies with maximum amplitudes of 160 nT that agree well with the measured anomalies; thus gabbros are unlikely to contribute to marine lineated magnetic anomalies...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{consists of}} two parts. One part deals with an integrated analysis of the structural anomaly associated with the Uinta Mountains, Utah. The other part deals with {{a study on the}} effect of Tamarix on soil and water quality. ^ The Uinta Mountains are an anomalous east-west trending range of the Central Rocky Mountains and are located in northeastern Utah and northwestern Colorado. They have long been recognized as a structural anomaly that is surrounded by other Laramide structures that trend N-S or northwest. The study area extends from - 112 to - 108 degrees longitude and 41. 5 to 39 degrees latitude and consists of three major geologic features: The Green River basin, Uinta Mountains, and the Uinta basin. This study investigates the tectonic evolution and the structural development of the Uinta aulacogen. There is a growing interest in exploration for petroleum and other hydrocarbons in the area of this study. Oil companies have been drilling wells in this area since the 19502 ̆ 7 s. The results of this study will enhance the existing knowledge of this region, and thus will help in the pursuit of hydrocarbons. ^ A highly integrated approach was followed for this investigation. Gravity, <b>magnetic,</b> <b>drill</b> hole, seismic and receiver function data were used in the analysis. Gravity and magnetic data were analyzed using software tools available in the Department of Geological Sciences such as Oasis Montaj and GIS. Filtered gravity maps show that the Uinta Mountains and the surrounding basins and uplifts are deep seated features. These maps also reveal a correlation between the Uinta Mountains and the regional tectonic structures. This correlation helps in understanding how the different tectonic events that this region went through contributed to the different phases of development of the Uinta aulacogen. Four gravity models were generated along four north-south trending profile lines covering the target area from east to west. Interpretations of these models give a comprehensive picture of the structures in the study area. These models show that the Uinta uplift is a single sedimentary block with numerous thrust faults on the northern and southern flanks of the uplift. These models also reveal the fact that the thickness of the crust is quite variable in the study area. This is also supported by the crustal thickness map constructed for this study from seismic and receiver function information. Magnetic maps show that the Proterozoic sedimentary package known as Uinta Mountain Group extends into the Basin and Range and indicates its link with the ancient rift margin in the Western United States. ^ Findings of this research are correlated to earlier studies and placed in a broader context. Finally an analogy is made between the Uinta aulacogen, the Southern Oklahoma aulacogen and the Dniepr-Donets aulacogen in Ukraine. This discussion focuses light on the mechanism that led to the Uinta 2 ̆ 7 s development from a failed rift to an uplift. ^ Part two of this research examined the effect of saltcedar (Tamarix sp) on water and soil properties in the Rio Grande River valley in West Texas. Tamarix is a woody phreatophyte (water-loving plant) common in riparian habitats. The presence of Tamarix in a river system raises concerns about its effect on water quality because it can increase the salinity of water and surrounding soil and it reduces stream flow. ^ Geophysical electrical techniques were used to track soil salinity and moisture changes caused by Tamarix, as well as to determine how soil salinity and moisture properties are altered when Tamarix is eradicated from the region. These techniques allowed more rapid in-situ assessment of the soil properties than the conventional method of removing soil and water samples for analysis. ^ This study was focused on the influence of Tamarix on soil properties and hydrology at the subsurface at four sites in the Rio Bosque Wetlands Park, El Paso, Texas Two sites had flourishing Tamarix and two others were areas where the Tamarix have either been killed with herbicides or chopped down but their stumps have been left in place. Two soil properties, namely resistivity and ground conductivity, were monitored at the sites for one year on a bi-monthly basis. Ground penetrating radar was used to investigate near surface soil stratigraphy that influences groundwater flow and soil properties. The target was to determine what role Tamarix plays in the seasonal variation of the electrical properties of the soil. ^ Seasonal variation in resistivity shows that resistivity primarily varies at shallow depth and this variation is more prominent away from the trees. Also this variation was higher at the dead tree site compared to the live tree sites. This suggests the trees act to maintain relatively constant salinity and moisture condition around themselves. ...|$|E

40|$|Paleo{{magnetic}} {{and rock}} magnetic {{analyses were conducted}} on discrete samples from sediments drilled during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 317 in the Canterbury Basin offshore New Zealand to assess the nature of magnetic remanence and to evaluate the directional data for a magnetic reversal stratigraphy. The sediments consist of relatively coarse grained lithologies from shelf to slope settings. The presence of several hiatuses, together with very low core recovery in some intervals as well as drillingrelated magnetic overprints, prevented establishment of a good shipboard magnetostratigraphy. In an effort to overcome some of the magnetic shortcomings and to substantiate shipboard measurements (overprints and partial demagnetization to 20 mT), natural remanent magnetization and subsequent full stepwise alternating field or thermal demagnetization measurements were taken on 765 individual discrete samples from Holes U 1351 B (131 samples), U 1352 B/U 1352 C (485 samples), U 1353 B (54 samples), and U 1354 B/U 1354 C (95 samples). Some rock magnetic measurements, including thermomagnetic curves, were taken on a few representative samples to acquire information on the magnetic carriers. The remanence intensity of the sediments is relatively low (usually 10 – 3 to 10 – 5 A/m) and often displays unstable behavior upon demagnetization. Demagnetization data have been separated into four different classes based on their quality. Classes 1 and 2 are of sufficient quality {{to be used for}} magnetostratigraphic purposes and represent ~ 40 % of the studied samples (although some of them could still represent a steep <b>magnetic</b> <b>drilling</b> overprint). Considering the calculated characteristic remanent magnetization inclination, a number of polarity zones can be defined. However, the fragmentary nature of the data set, mostly related to core recovery in addition to detected and undetected sedimentary hiatuses, makes determination of the precise position of the reversal boundaries and their correlation to the geomagnetic polarity timescale a difficult task. Nevertheless, when combined shipboard and postcruise discrete measurements are placed within biostratigraphic constraints, some magnetostratigraphic insights can potentially refine the available age model. These insights include the identification of the Matuyama/Brunhes boundary (C 1 r 1 r/C 1 n, 0. 778 Ma) at all four sites, the Gauss/Matuyama boundary (C 2 An. 1 n/C 2 r. 2 r, 2. 581 Ma) in Hole U 1351 B, and also the position of the Olduvai Subchron (C 2 n, 1. 778 – 1. 945 Ma) in Hole U 1351 B, which relates to the position of the classical Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary...|$|R

40|$|Saline {{groundwater}} poses {{problems in}} parts of the irrigation area that straddles the Great Divide near Mareeba, north Queensland. In some places the watertable has been rising rapidly, leading us to examine aquifer geology to determine why. Two study sites were chosen, both being relatively flat areas where the catchments of the Mitchell River (which flows in to the Gulf of Carpentaria) and Barron River (which flows into the Coral Sea) adjoin. Aquifer geology was examined using aerial <b>magnetic</b> survey data, <b>drilling</b> records from existing bores, on-ground <b>magnetic</b> surveys, <b>drilling</b> and other on-ground observations. At the first study site, in Cattle Creek catchment (sub-catchment of the Mitchell River) east of Mareeba, basalt flows approximately 10 m thick and several 100 m wide were found, buried under 7 m of alluvium. The basalt flows cut across from Granite Creek catchment (sub- catchment of the Barron River) into Cattle Creek catchment. The continental divide in this region has therefore migrated west since the eruption of the basalt, 1. 79 million years ago. A rapid rate of watertable rise in Cattle Creek has previously been attributed to high recharge from within the catchment. However groundwater flow may be following the trend of the sub-surface strata, rather than reflecting the surface drainage divides. The rising watertable levels in the Cattle Creek catchment may therefore be influenced by groundwater flows from the adjacent Granite Creek catchment. At the second study site, north of Mareeba, buried basalt flows also occur along the continental divide between Mitchell River and Barron River. Borehole data, combined with accurate surveying of bedrock in the present river channel, showed that the paleo-channel down which the lava flowed must have been a tributary of Mitchell River. The major tributaries of this blocked channel were diverted to the east to become the headwaters of Barron River, resulting in the western migration of the continental divide. The consequent reduction in stream energy available to the truncated headwaters of Mitchell River has led to channel infill and aggradation of more than 30 m since the diversion of the Barron River. In regions where surface gradients are low, catchment area management may need to consider the practices operating in adjacent catchments...|$|R

This technology requires precise separation between the production well and the injection well to ensure the efficient drainage of the reservoir. By studying {{the attitude of the}} downhole probe tube and the production well trajectory, an algorithm is proposed for eliminating ferromagnetic interference while drilling injection wells. A high accuracy filter circuit has been designed to correct the detected magnetic signals, which are ultra-weak, frequency-instable, and narrow-band. The directional <b>drilling</b> <b>magnetic</b> guidance system (DD-MGS) has been developed by integrating these advanced techniques. It contains a sub-system for the ranging calculation software, a magnetic source, a downhole probe tube and a sub-system for collecting & processing the detected signals.
