40|$|A {{lead-free}} {{surface mounting}} process was assessed and {{compared to a}} conventional leaded one. The ternary lead-free Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu solder paste was compared to Sn- 36 Pb- 2 Ag. Two different board finishes were used, the first one being a lead-free <b>Matte</b> <b>tin</b> (100 % Sn) and the second a Sn- 37 Pb. The boards were aged in a pressure cooker {{under the influence of}} 103 ºC, 100 % RH for a time period of 30 days. The shear strength of some solder joints was measured as a function of aging and production parameters used. The void content was analysed as a function of board metallization, solder paste used and component pitch (large and small pitch). The solderability results were also analysed, where factors such as wetting, solder balls, bridges, and solder joint shape were compared. The results show that <b>Matte</b> <b>tin</b> is the preferred board finish when using the lead free solder paste. This is {{based on the fact that}} the combination lead-free solder and <b>Matte</b> <b>tin</b> resulted in much lower void content compared to the combination lead-free solder and Sn- 37 Pb metallization. The shear test results show that the un-aged boards attained a higher shear strength compared to the aged ones. Two failure modes were however observed during the shear testing. The majority of the aged samples showed complete pad lift-off while un-aged samples showed a fracture through the solder joint. Regarding the solderability results, the lead free process depicted comparable quality to the leaded process...|$|E

40|$|With {{the global}} {{transition}} to lead-free electronics, the electronic component market has seen {{an increase in}} the selection of pure tin and tin-rich alloys as lead-free component finishes. The adoption of tin-rich finishes has enhanced a reliability issue associated with the formation of electrically conductive whiskers, emanating from tin finished surface. A spontaneous growth of whisker may bridge adjacent conductors, leading to current leakage or electrical shorts. Whiskers tend to grow over many months. However, {{due to a lack of}} the factors accelerating whisker growth, prediction of whisker formation is extremely difficult. Therefore, the effective mitigation strategies are necessary, particularly for high-reliability applications, which require a long product operational life. The objective of this study is to investigate a method for characterizing whisker growth, which can further enable measuring the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. To achieve this objective, a set of experiments was conducted using <b>matte</b> and bright <b>tin</b> platings on copper, Alloy- 42, and brass metal coupons.

40|$|Lead (Pb), {{commonly}} used in plating of electronic components, is required to be phased out due to the hazards it poses. Possible alternative technologies and materials are discussed. Whisker formation, avoidance of which was an important reason {{for the use of}} lead as an alloying element, is examined. Whisker formation is dependent on stress in the electrodeposit, and strategies for its avoidance are discussed. Alloys of tin with bismuth, copper or silver may be difficult to control on an ongoing production basis and are also known to be liable for whisker formation. Pure <b>matte</b> <b>tin,</b> when plated appropriately with respect to substrate, current density and other operating conditions, has fewer problems and can be used profitably in existing plating installations...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{termination}} finish of Small Output Integrated Circuit (SOIC) chip components were converted from Pb-free to Sn-Pb (backward conversion) and from Sn-Pb to Pb-free (forward conversion). The motivation for these conversions {{is due to}} a combination of factors such as the supply chain constraints on component availability and European Union’s (EU) legislation on “Restriction of Hazardous Substances ” (or RoHS). Additionally, components with 100 % <b>matte</b> <b>tin</b> finish were converted to Pb-free Sn- 3. 5 %Ag- 0. 5 %Cu (SAC 305) finish. This type of conversion would be necessary to avoid tin whiskers issue on <b>matte</b> <b>tin</b> finish components. The conversions were performed using a “Robotic Stripping and Solder Dipping Process”. After conversion, the parts were examined using x-ray fluorescence (XRF) to verify for RoHS compliance. Electrical and die visual investigation utilizing optical microscopy, DC pin to pin electrical testing and acid de-encapsulation were performed on one of the converted component (MC 14111 DW) to inspect for damage on die, after the conversion process. There were no opens or short circuits found during the electrical test. The die was undamaged after the conversion process. As the final evaluation method, the converted parts were assembled on an actual PCB using both tin-lead and lead-free process. Three Printed Circuit Board (PCB) surface finishes namely Immersion Silver (ImAg), Organic 1 Solderable Preservative (OSP), and Electroless Nickel/Immersion Gold (ENIG) were evaluated. The microstructures of the converted components were normal in appearance and had well defined IMC both along the board and component interface. After microstructure analysis, lead pull testing was performed at ‘as assembled condition ’ (AA) and ‘after thermal aging ’ (ATA) to determine the mechanical reliability of converted component termination finishes with respect to the original termination finish. The results indicate that the converted component has almost the same pull strength as to that of the original component...|$|E
40|$|Surprisingly, {{after almost}} 60 years of {{research}} into the causes of tin whisker formation, very little experimental evidence exists to verify {{some of the basic}} mechanisms believed to be involved in whisker growth. Long range diffusion of tin is thought to occur in order to supply the amount of tin required to form a whisker, however, no direct experimental data to support the long range diffusion hypothesis has been generated. The objective {{of this study was to}} use tin isotopes and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) to evaluate the room temperature self-diffusion of tin within whisker-prone tin platings (bright and <b>matte</b> <b>tin).</b> Tin diffusion was monitored through the plating thickness and also parallel to the substrate by using SIMS surface analysis and depth profiling techniques. The amount of each isotope that was incorporated into the whiskers that formed and variations in the isotopic percentages along the length of each whisker were quantified (before and after sputtering of the whiskers) ...|$|E
40|$|In the industry’s drive towards {{becoming}} {{lead free}} (Pb-free) by July 1, 2006, as {{dictated by the}} WEEE Directive, several Pb-free terminal finishes have been proposed and evaluated. Some of them were rejected as soon as evaluations began. Others have been dropped along the way due to problems with either manufacturability or reliability. However, a few alternatives are becoming increasingly popular and {{seem to be the}} “chosen ones”. SnAgCu alloys, for example, have emerged as the clear choice for Pb-free solder. In contrast, there is no clear winner yet in the area of Pb-free plating alternatives. Even though 100 % <b>matte</b> <b>Tin</b> (Sn) seems to be the most popular, its widespread acceptance is impeded by whisker growth concerns based on long-past issues with pure Tin lead finishes. This paper present the findings of a series of whisker growth studies performed on 100 % matte Sn plating on Copper (Cu) leadframes. Studies were done on different package types, assembled at different locations at different times, with and without mitigation techniques and on samples at a component level and as mounted on PWBs. Since these studies started when no Pb-free or whisker definitions or standards were available, best known methods were employed in the studies. However, results from a new study done using NEMI’s recommended Sn whisker test methods and failure criteria are also included. Based on the results from this wide variety of samples and references from other similar published data, we demonstrate that 100 % matte Sn finish on Cu leadframe is resistant to whisker growth under a variety of stress test conditions, and can be expected to produce whisker free assemblies in virtually all expected applications...|$|E

To achieve this objective, a set of experiments was conducted using matte and bright tin platings on copper, Alloy- 42, and brass metal coupons. The plated coupons were subjected to high temperature exposures, including annealing (at 150 ºC/one hour). Whisker growth on tin-plated samples was characterized using environmental scanning electron microscopy, in terms of the maximum whisker length, length distribution, and whisker density, at different time periods up to 24 months. The experimental results have shown different behaviors of whisker growth (length and density) between bright and <b>matte</b> <b>tin,</b> depending on the materials and exposure conditions. It was experimentally demonstrated that bright tin over brass could be considered a worst-case scenario for assessing the risks associated with tin whiskers. This work has further revealed that the current industry practice of testing for 3000 hours for monitoring the propensity of tin whiskers is insufficient to cover a saturation of whisker density and capture the temporal nature of whiskers. In order to overcome such insufficiencies, the use of time-based distribution data for whisker length and whisker density was proposed as an alternative method for characterizing whisker growth. With the application of this proposed method, the effect of annealing (150 ºC/one hour) and its effect under the presence of electrical current were investigated for retarding whisker formation and growth on tin-plating...|$|E
