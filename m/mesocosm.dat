25|$|The use {{of silicon}} by diatoms is {{believed}} by many researchers {{to be the}} key to their ecological success. In a now classic study, Egge and Aksnes (1992) found that diatom dominance of <b>mesocosm</b> communities was directly related to the availability of silicic acid — when concentrations were greater than 2 µmol m−3, they found that diatoms typically represented more than 70% of the phytoplankton community. Raven (1983) noted that, relative to organic cell walls, silica frustules require less energy to synthesize (approximately 8% of a comparable organic wall), potentially a significant saving on the overall cell energy budget. Other researchers have suggested that the biogenic silica in diatom cell walls acts as an effective pH buffering agent, facilitating the conversion of bicarbonate to dissolved CO2 (which is more readily assimilated). Notwithstanding the possible advantages conferred by silicon, diatoms typically have higher growth rates than other algae of a corresponding size.|$|E

These relationships varied in different <b>mesocosms</b> and depended on the trophic status of water and the exudation rates of organic carbon (EOC) by phytoplankton. Close coupling of bacterial production to V(max) of GLCase activity was observed only in nutrient-enriched <b>mesocosms.</b> The relationship between GLCase and DOC content was also significant in enriched water. There was no correlation between the V(max) of GLCase and DOC and bacterial production in nutrient-impoverished and control (mesotrophic) enclosures. However, the V(max) of AMPase correlated well to DOC and bacterial production in these <b>mesocosms.</b> AMPase activity did not correlate with DOC and bacterial production in nutrient-impoverished <b>mesocosms.</b> There was no relationship between bacterial biomass and enzyme activity in all studied <b>mesocosms.</b> Comparison of the rates of phytoplankton production of EOC and rates of the bacterial organic carbon demand (BOCD) in nutrient-impoverished <b>mesocosms</b> showed that EOC flux constituted, on average, 90 % of BOCD. However, in nutrient-enriched <b>mesocosms</b> EOC contributed only, on average, 27 % to the BOCD; thus, in these <b>mesocosms,</b> bacteria were probably organic-carbon limited.

40|$|International audienceBenthic foraminifera from an {{intertidal}} mudflat (Bay of Bourgneuf, France) {{have been}} exposed to different types of oil-polluted seawater in an experimental laboratory setting. The aim of this experiment was to study the response of foraminiferal faunas from the intertidal zone to oil spills, as observed after the wreckage of the Erika oil tanker in December 1999 on the French Atlantic coast. In the course of the experiment a saturated seawater mix (SSW) and a water accommodated fraction of the oil (WAF) were on several occasions added to a part of the <b>mesocosms,</b> and the response of the foraminiferal assemblages was monitored during 3 months after the start of oil treatments. Several potential effects of oil-pollution were studied: 1) foraminiferal standing stocks, 2) anomalous growth patterns resulting in deformed or abnormal foraminiferal tests, and 3) changes in the taxonomical composition of the assemblage. The foraminiferal assemblages {{at the start of the}} experiment were dominantly composed of Haynesina germanica. The experimental results show a strong decline in density in all <b>mesocosms</b> (including the control <b>mesocosms)</b> over time. During the first 2 weeks of the experiment, this decline was stronger in the oil-treated <b>mesocosms</b> than in the control <b>mesocosms.</b> After the first 2 weeks, the replicates of the oil-treatments showed an extreme variability, whereas the control <b>mesocosms</b> showed less variability with densities steadily decreasing over time. In some of the oil-treated <b>mesocosms,</b> we observed strongly increased densities, indicative of reproductive events. In all other oil-treated <b>mesocosms</b> foraminiferal densities decreased more severely than in the control <b>mesocosms.</b> The different types of oil–seawater mixtures did not cause a significantly different response. After 3 months, some taxa that had not been encountered previously in the field samples or in the <b>mesocosms</b> (e. g., Textularia earlandi) appeared in the 63 – 125 μm fractions of the oil-treated <b>mesocosms.</b> We conclude that there is a dual response to oil-induced pollution: foraminiferal faunas may respond by a strongly increased mortality, and/or by an accelerated reproduction of some of the taxa...|$|R

40|$|To {{study the}} fate of Pseudomonas putida DSM 3931 in an aquatic environment, {{cultures}} of the strain were released into lake water <b>mesocosms.</b> P. putida, bearing the TOL-plasmid, was released as a representative xenobiotic-degrading microorganism. The release {{was carried out in}} <b>mesocosms</b> with unamended lake water and in lake water with added culture medium to compare the survival of the strain due to the influence of different organic load. As a comparison, the survival of P. putida was followed in microcosms with sterile lake water. Survival and fate of the strain were determined by means of immunofluorescence with highly specific monoclonal antibodies and growth on selective agar medium for up to ten weeks after release. Addition of medium had a pronounced influence on survival in <b>mesocosms.</b> In <b>mesocosms</b> without added medium, the number of P. putida cells decreased within ten days by over 2 orders of magnitude. In <b>mesocosms</b> with medium, cell numbers increased in the first two days by an order of magnitude and were, after ten days, in the same range as at the time of introduction. Over time, cell numbers decreased but remained detectable in both types of <b>mesocosms</b> for up to ten weeks after release. In <b>mesocosms</b> with unamended lake water, the major fraction of the cells was attached to particles after two days. In <b>mesocosms</b> with medium, large aggregates of P. putida cells formed which included algae. The observed decrease in cell numbers in <b>mesocosms</b> was attributed mainly to grazing. Sedimentation was an additional factor contributing to loss of cells out of the water column, which especially affected aggregate-forming cells in <b>mesocosms</b> with medium in the long run (beyond two weeks).

We {{conducted}} {{a series of}} experiments, coupling seepage meters directly to phytoplankton enclosure experiments to determine the impacts of groundwater-borne nutrients on biomass and response in community structure of phytoplankton. To assess the impacts of groundwater-borne nutrients, we measured chlorophyll a concentrations as a proxy for overall biomass and used genetic sequencing techniques to characterize the phytoplankton community structure. Groundwater carried a high N load to the estuary with NO 3 - up to 295 µmol/L, and NH 4 + up to 55 µmol/L. As a result treatment <b>mesocosms</b> had NO 3 - concentrations up to 55. 5 µmol/L and NH 4 + up to 4. 0 µmol/L, while control <b>mesocosms</b> received filtered seawater, and were thus relatively low in nutrients (24. 2 µmol/L NO 3 - and ∼ 2 µmol/L NH 4 +). In June the highest chlorophyll a concentrations occurred after 3. 5 days, with significant differences between control <b>mesocosms</b> (4. 3 ± 0. 2 mg/L), groundwater amended <b>mesocosms</b> (7. 0 ± 0. 6 mg/L), and <b>mesocosms</b> receiving groundwater across the sediment-water interface (10. 9 ± 0. 2 mg/L). In August, biomass peaked after 3 days and showed larger variation across treatment groups with groundwater amended <b>mesocosms</b> reaching significantly higher values (36. 6 ± 2. 0 mg/L) than <b>mesocosms</b> receiving groundwater across the sediment-water interface (18. 7 ± 4. 8 mg/L), which showed significantly different values than both controls and phosphate amended <b>mesocosms</b> (11. 9 ± 0. 7 and 9. 9 ± 0. 2 mg/L respectively). Community gene sequence data showed that species assemblage was also impacted by availability of nutrients, with significant differences in community structure for <b>mesocosms</b> receiving nutrients vs control <b>mesocosms</b> in both June and August experiments. Several harmful algal species also proliferated in high nutrient treatments, including Cylindrotheca closterium, Karlodinium veneficum, Nitzschia ovalis, and Heterocapsa sp.

40|$|Abstract We present {{evidence}} of a strong response to light by Chrysaora quinquecirrha, the common sea nettle, based on studies in large enclosures (<b>mesocosms).</b> This result is somewhat unexpected due to the reported absence of light-sensing ocelli in marginal sense organs of this scyphomedusan jelly-fish. We used 5 -m-deep <b>mesocosms</b> to document light responses and vertical migration of Cquin-quecirrha in both natural and manipulated light fields. Chrysaora quinquecirrha appear to be negatively phototactic; a large fraction of the population always rose towards the surface within 10 - 15 min after the <b>mesocosms</b> were covered to exclude light, and descended just as quickly when they were uncovered. When natural daylight entering the <b>mesocosms</b> was unaltered, C. quinquecirrha exhibited a consistent pattern of diel vertical migration during 1 - 3 week experiments. Medusae remained at depth {{during the day and}} rose to the surface (top 1 m) of the <b>mesocosms</b> during late afternoon.
