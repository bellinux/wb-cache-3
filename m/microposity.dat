40|$|The {{stabilisation}} of pitch fibres (PFs) is {{the most}} important step for their subsequent use in the preparation of carbon fibres (CFs) and their resulting characteristics. The present work studies the influence that the stabilisation time has on the porosity of the CFs, and on the subsequent properties as carbon molecular sieve (CMS). The increase of the stabilisation time carried out at 573 K, from 2 to 8 h favours their CMS properties producing a decrease in the <b>microposity</b> accessible to N 2, which gets completely blocked after 6 and 8 h, while the narrow microporosity (V-DR CO 2) remains accessible. Adsorption kinetic studies with CH 4 and CO 2 were performed to assess the possibility of using these CFs as CMS by comparing them with Takeda 3 A CMS. The results suggest that there is an optimal stabilisation time which allows the preparation of CFs from an abundant raw precursor with properties similar to Takeda 3 A CMS.

40|$|The {{combination}} of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) allowed a clear identification and quantification of nitrogenous species Incorporated Upon nitridation ill three different zeolites one Y zeolite (Si/Al ratio of 2. 6) and two ultrastable Y zeolites (Si/Al ratios of 13 and 37). Both {{the amount and}} the chemical nature of incorporated nitrogen species were controlled by the nitridation temperature. Namely, ill increase of the temperature induces in increase of the nitrogen content {{and the appearance of}} nitrogenous species in the following order of increasing temperature: NH 4 +, adsorbed NH 3, -NH 2, > NH, and > N- Based on these spectroscopic results, a mechanism of nitridation in function of temperature was proposed, this mechanism being independent of the properties of the parent zeolite. We evidenced here that the replacement of hydroxyls groups located in the <b>microposity</b> of the zeolite by nitrogen species was effective which call be very motivating result for the application of these materials as shape selective catalysts...|$|E
