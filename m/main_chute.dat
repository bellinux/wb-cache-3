2500|$|The {{spacecraft}} was cone shaped, with a neck at {{the narrow}} end. It had a convex base, which carried {{a heat shield}} (Item 2 in the diagram below) consisting of an aluminum honeycomb covered with multiple layers of fiberglass. Strapped to it was a retropack (1) consisting of three rockets deployed to brake the spacecraft during reentry. Between these were three minor rockets for separating the spacecraft from the launch vehicle at orbital insertion. The straps that held the package could be severed when {{it was no longer}} needed. Next to the heat shield was the pressurized crew compartment (3). Inside, an astronaut would be strapped to a form-fitting seat with instruments {{in front of him and}} with his back to the heat shield. Underneath the seat was the environmental control system supplying oxygen and heat, scrubbing the air of CO2, vapor and odors, and (on orbital flights) collecting urine. The recovery compartment (4) at the narrow end of the spacecraft contained three parachutes: a drogue to stabilize free fall and two <b>main</b> <b>chutes,</b> a primary and reserve. Between the heat shield and inner wall of the crew compartment was a landing skirt, deployed by letting down the heat shield before landing. On top of the recovery compartment was the antenna section (5) containing both antennas for communication and scanners for guiding spacecraft orientation. Attached was a flap used to ensure [...] the spacecraft was faced heat shield first during reentry. A launch escape system (6) was mounted to the narrow end of the spacecraft containing three small solid-fueled rockets which could be fired briefly in a launch failure to separate the capsule safely from its booster. It would deploy the capsule's parachute for a landing nearby at sea. (See also Mission profile for details.) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{changes in}} both {{physical}} and chemical properties of interstitial water were investigated within a large gravel bar to determine if the parafluvial zone was a hotspot for nutrient transformations in a lowland eutrophic river, the Doubs (Eastern France). Interstitial water was sampled in 30 piezometers along five transects across the gravel bar, surface water was sampled in <b>main</b> and <b>chute</b> channels. Five campaigns of sampling were performed among summer and winter. In both interstitial and surface samples, water chemistry (electrical conductivity, pH, chloride, dissolved oxygen concentrations-DO) and nutrient concentrations (nitrate-NO 3 (-), ammonium-NH 4 (+), soluble reactive phosphorus-SRP, dissolved organic carbon-DOC) were measured. Moreover, temperature, water level, sediment grain size distribution and total bacterial abundance were assessed along a flowpath through a lateral gravel bar of the Doubs River. Measurements of water table elevation in the bar, <b>main</b> and <b>chute</b> channels indicated that the parafluvial flowpath was perpendicular to the main channel. Very low changes in chloride concentration and electrical conductivity showed minor groundwater input along the flowpath. The parafluvial zone was 0. 9 m thick under the mean piezometric level, hydraulic gradients along the flowpath were 0. 3 %, and the discharge of interstitial water through the bar calculated at low flow was 40. 6 m(3) day(- 1). Most changes in interstitial nutrients occurred during the warm season, suggesting that biotic mechanisms occurred. Along the flowpath, DO, DOC, and bacterial abundance declined, while phosphate increased. Temporal trends of nitrate were less clear, exhibiting a slight increase during spring (organic matter biodegradation) and a decrease during summer (denitrification). Using the parafluvial discharge and nutrient concentrations of water infiltrating into and seeping from the gravel bar, the retention capacity of the bar was 171 gC day(- 1) for DOC and 48. 3 gN day(- 1) for nitrate. Phosphate production ranged from 0. 65 to 2. 3 gP day(- 1). These values were low compared to the nutrient fluxes in the river Doubs, suggesting a minimal local impact of the parafluvial zone in regulating of river pollution...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the 2017 Oroville Dam {{spillway}} incident. This event is {{yet another example of}} the severe problems the United States has with maintaining its large infrastructure. However, in order to better understand how events unfolded, it is first necessary to conduct a detailed analysis of Oroville Dam and the basic elements of its location, the Feather River Basin. An assessment of the hydroclimatic characteristics of the area reveals it to have a Mediterranean climate, indicated by heavy precipitation during the winter months, producing floods during the spring, followed by almost completely dry summers. From a geological standpoint, the area near Oroville Dam contains metavolcanic rock, which is of adequate hardness, but it is also significantly weathered, especially near the ground surface. This thesis also contains a summary of various Oroville Dam design elements, as well as a full history of its construction. This analysis reveals hidden clues that help identify the causes of the 2017 incident. Most significantly, design criteria for the main and emergency spillways appear much more relaxed than those of the main structure. Next, a study of the previous significant floods that occurred at Oroville Dam is conducted. This reveals that reservoir levels were much higher during the 2017 incident compared to other events, which indicates a need to lower the minimum flood control elevation. Futhermore, this thesis includes an extensive timeline of the 2017 incident events, including the damages to Oroville Dam’s <b>main</b> spillway <b>chute</b> and area downstream of the emergency spillway. After further research, initial cause of the main spillway failure is defined as concrete chute floor slab uplift, caused due to faults in the drain system below it. In addition, perusal of previous official inspection reports reveals that under current practice standards, if a comparable incident occurs again, its indications are unlikely to be detected in time. Finally, recommendations are made in order to avoid similar events from happening in the future. For Oroville Dam, this means lowering the minimum flood control elevation level and creating a fully armored concrete emergency spillway. In the short term, informal inspections by the authorities that operate large structures in the United States can discover faults before they turn into accidents. However, a more long-term plan to effectively repair and maintain the country’s existing infrastructure needs to be put into action immediately...|$|R
50|$|Formerly, {{the main}} chutes were {{released}} from the SRB at impact using a parachute release nut ordnance system (residual loads in the main chutes would deploy the parachute attach fittings with floats tethered to each fitting). The current design keeps the main chutes attached during water impact (initial impact and slapdown). Salt Water Activated Release (SWAR) devices are now incorporated into the <b>main</b> <b>chute</b> riser lines to simplify recovery efforts and reduce damage to the SRB. The drogue deployment bag/pilot parachutes, drogue parachutes and frustums, each <b>main</b> <b>chute,</b> and the SRBs are buoyant and are recovered.|$|E
50|$|In 1987, Steven Gyrsting of Paoli, Pennsylvania, jumped using {{gear that}} was not BASE-specific gear and was killed after {{he was unable to}} open his reserve chute in time when his <b>main</b> <b>chute</b> failed to deploy.|$|E
50|$|After the drogue chute has {{stabilized}} the SRB in a tail-first attitude, the frustum {{is separated}} from the forward skirt by a pyrotechnic charge triggered by the low-altitude baroswitch at a nominal altitude of 5500 ft about 243 seconds after SRB separation. The frustum is then {{pulled away from the}} SRB by the drogue chute. The <b>main</b> <b>chute</b> suspension lines are pulled out from deployment bags that remain in the frustum. At full extension of the lines, which are 203 ft long, the three main chutes are pulled from their deployment bags and inflate to their first reefed condition. The frustum and drogue parachute continue on a separate trajectory to splashdown. After specified time delays (using redundant 10 and 17-second reefing line cutters), the <b>main</b> <b>chute</b> reefing lines are cut and the chutes inflate to their second reefed and full open configurations. The <b>main</b> <b>chute</b> cluster decelerates the SRB to terminal conditions. Each of the 136 ft diameter, 20-degree conical ribbon parachutes have a design load of approximately 195000 lb and each weighs approximately 2180 lb. These parachutes are the largest that have ever been used — both in deployed size and load weight. The RSRM nozzle extension is severed by a pyrotechnic charge about 20 seconds after frustum separation.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} the approaches and methods selected in fabrication of a carbon composite demonstration {{structure for the}} Composite Crew Module (CCM) Program. The program is managed by the NASA Safety and Engineering Center with participants from ten NASA Centers and AFRL. Multiple aerospace contractors are participating in the design development, tooling and fabrication effort as well. The goal {{of the program is}} to develop an agency wide design team for composite habitable spacecraft. The specific goals for this development project are: a). To gain hands on experience in design, building and testing a composite crew module. b) To validate key assumptions by resolving composite spacecraft design details through fabrication and testing of hardware. This abstract is based on Preliminary Design data [...] The final design will continue to evolve through the fall of 2007 with fabrication mostly completed by conference date. From a structures perspective, the. CCM {{can be viewed as a}} pressure module with variable pressure time histories and a series of both impact and quasi-static, high intensity point, line, and area distributed loads. The portion of the overall space vehicle being designed and. fabricated by the CCM team is just the pressure module and primary loading points. The heaviest point loads are applied and distributed to the pressure module at. an aluminum Service Module/Alternate Launch Abort System (SM/ALAS) fittings and at <b>Main</b> and Drogue <b>Chute</b> fittings. Significant line loads with metal to metal impact is applied at. the Lids ring. These major external point and line loads as well as pressure impact loads (blast and water landing) are applied to the lobed floor though the reentry shield and crushable materials. The pressure module is divided into upper and lower. shells that mate together with a bonded belly band splice joint to create the completed structural assembly. The benefits of a split CCM far outweigh the risks of a joint. These benefits include lower tooling cost and less manufacturing risk. Assembly of the top and bottom halves of the pressure shell will allow access to the interior of the shell throughout remaining fabrication sequence and can also potentially permit extensive installation of equipment and. crew facilities prior to final assembly of the two shell halves. A Pi pre-form is a woven carbon composite material which is provided in pre-impregnated form and frozen for long term storage. The cross-section shape allows the top of the pi to be bonded to a flat or curved surface with a second flat plate composite section bonded between two upstanding legs of the Pi. One of the regions relying on the merits of the Pi pre-form is the backbone. All connections among plates of the backbone structure, including the upper flanges, and to the lobe base of the pressure shell are currently joined by Pi pre-forms. The intersection of backbone composite plates is formed by application of two Pi pre-forms, top flanges and lobed surfaces are bonded with one Pi pre-form. The process of applying the pre-impregnated pi-preform will be demonstrated to include important steps like surface preparation, forming, application of pressure dams, vacuum bagging for consolidation, and curing techniques. Chopped carbon fiber tooling was selected over other traditional metallic and carbon fiber tooling. The requirement of schedule and cost economy for a moderate reuse cure tool warranted composite tooling options. Composite tooling schedule duration of 18 weeks compared favorably against other metallic tooling including invar tooling. Composite tooling also shows significant cost savings over low CTE metallic options. The composite tooling options were divided into two groups and the final decision was based on the cost, schedule, tolerance, temperature, and reuse requirements...|$|R

50|$|For {{recovery}}, {{they have}} a recovery system and receivers that permitted overriding the program and flying it 'by hand'. The recovery sequence was triggered by the flight control computer at the preset position, unless overridden by the Drone Recovery Officer (DRO) in the control vehicle. Normally the drone {{was picked up by}} radar as it approached the recovery area and controlled by the DRO. Last minute course corrections were made as necessary and the recovery sequence triggered at the precise point to drop the drone on top of the waiting recovery helicopter. The on-board recovery system consisted of a servomechanism that shut down the engine, deployed a drag chute (to cause the drone to nose over) and opened the main parachute at a preset altitude. The recovery helicopter then flew over the <b>main</b> <b>chute</b> engaging a reinforced catch chute with a set of trailing hooks attached to an internal winch. The drone was then winched up to just below the recovery helicopter and flown back to base. An alternative method of recovery allowed the drone to reach the ground under the <b>main</b> <b>chute.</b> On ground impact a sensor operated a charge that severed the chute risers allowing the drone to be recovered. This method had a higher likelihood of damage and was not preferred.|$|E

50|$|The {{recovery}} sequence {{begins with}} {{the operation of the}} high-altitude baroswitch, which triggers the pyrotechnic nose cap thrusters. This ejects the nose cap, which deploys the pilot parachute. Nose cap separation occurs at a nominal altitude of 15704 ft, about 218 seconds after SRB separation. The 11.5 ft diameter conical ribbon pilot parachute provides the force to pull lanyards attached to cut knives, which cut the loop securing the drogue retention straps. This allows the pilot chute to pull the drogue pack from the SRB, causing the drogue suspension lines to deploy from their stored position. At full extension of the twelve 105 ft suspension lines, the drogue deployment bag is stripped away from the canopy, and the 54 ft diameter conical ribbon drogue parachute inflates to its initial reefed condition. The drogue disreefs twice after specified time delays (using redundant 7 and 12-second reefing line cutters), and it reorients/stabilizes the SRB for <b>main</b> <b>chute</b> deployment. The drogue parachute has a design load of approximately 315000 lb and weighs approximately 1200 lb.|$|E
