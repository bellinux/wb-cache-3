40|$|Optimally doped ceramic superconductors (cuprates, pnictides, etc.) exhibit {{transition}} temperatures T c {{much larger}} than strongly coupled metallic superconductors like Pb (T c =  7. 2  K, E g/kT c =  4. 5) and exhibit many universal features that appear to contradict the Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer theory of superconductivity based on attractive electron-phonon pairing interactions. These complex materials are strongly disordered and contain several competing nanophases that cannot be described effectively by parameterized Hamiltonian models, yet their phase diagrams also exhibit many universal features in both the normal and superconductive states. Here we review the rapidly growing body of experimental results that suggest that these anomalously universal features {{are the result of}} <b>marginal</b> <b>stabilities</b> of the ceramic electronic and lattice structures. These dual <b>marginal</b> <b>stabilities</b> favor both electronic percolation of a dopant network and rigidity percolation of the deformed lattice network. This “double percolation” model has previously explained many features of the normal-state transport properties of these materials and is the only theory that has successfully predicted strict lowest upper bounds for T c in the cuprate and pnictide families. Here it is extended to include Coulomb correlations and percolative band narrowing, as well as an angular energy gap equation, which rationalizes angularly averaged gap/T c ratios, and shows that these {{are similar to those of}} conventional strongly coupled superconductors...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the geometrical properties of stellar disks (a flatness and truncation radius) and the disk kinematics are considered for edge-on galaxies. It is shown that the observed thickness of the disks and the approximate constancy of their thickness along the radius well agrees with the condition of their <b>marginal</b> local gravitational <b>stability.</b> As a consequence, those galaxies whose disks are thinner should harbor more massive dark haloes. The correlation between the de-projeced central brightness of the disks and their flatness is found (the low surface brightness disks {{tend to be the}} thinniest ones). We also show that positions of observed photometrically determined truncation radii $R_{cut}$ for the stellar disks support the idea of <b>marginal</b> local gravitational <b>stability</b> of gaseous protodisks at $R =R_{cut}$, and hence the steepening of photometric profiles may be a result of too inefficient star formation beyond $R_{cut}$.

50|$|Based on the Standard Cirrus, the {{original}} Mini-Nimbus HS-7 design had an all-moving tailplane and fibre glass wing spars. A tailplane anti-balance tab was a required modification for certification in the United Kingdom after flight testing by Derek Piggott {{on behalf of}} the British Gliding Association revealed very low stick forces and <b>marginal</b> pitch <b>stability</b> of the HS-7 version. A conventional tail was added for the Mini-Nimbus B version. The conventional horizontal stabiliser/elevator configuration was less sensitive to inputs by the pilot making it easier to fly without constantly making small adjustments to the pitch attitude. This was due to the much larger control surface of the former compared to the later configuration.|$|R
50|$|Flying wings lack {{anywhere}} to attach an efficient vertical stabilizer or fin. Any fin must attach directly {{on to the}} rear part of the wing, giving a small moment arm from the aerodynamic center, which in turn means that the fin is inefficient and to be effective the fin area must be large. Such a large fin has weight and drag penalties, and can negate {{the advantages of the}} flying wing. The problem can be minimized by increasing the wing sweepback and placing twin fins outboard near the tips, as for example in a low-aspect-ratio delta wing, but many flying wings have gentler sweepback and consequently have, at best, <b>marginal</b> <b>stability.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} galactic-scale {{triggering}} of star formation.

40|$|We {{construct}} stationary global {{configurations of}} both aligned and unaligned logarithmic spiral perturbations in a composite disc system of stellar and isopedically magnetized gaseous singular isothermal discs (SIDs) coupled by gravity. The thin gaseous SID is threaded across by a vertical magnetic field B_z with a constant {{ratio of the}} surface gas mass density to B_z. There exist two classes of stationary magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solutions with in-phase and out-of-phase density perturbations. For both aligned and unaligned cases with azimuthal periodicities |m|≥ 2 (m is an integer), there may be two, one, and no solution situations, depending on the chosen parameters. For the transition criteria from an axisymmetric equilibrium to aligned secular bar-like instabilities, the corresponding T/|W| ratio can be {{much lower than the}} oft-quoted value of T/|W|∼ 0. 14, where T is the total rotational kinetic energy and W is the total gravitational potential energy plus the magnetic energy. The T/|W| ratios for the two sets of solutions in different ranges are separated by m/(4 m+ 4). For the unaligned cases, we study <b>marginal</b> <b>stabilities</b> for axisymmetric (m= 0) and non-axisymmetric (m≠ 0) disturbances. The gravitational influence of an axisymmetric dark matter halo on the background is also examined. The global analytical solutions and their properties are valuable for testing and benchmarking numerical MHD codes. Our model analysis contains more realistic elements and offers useful insights into the structures and dynamics of disc galaxies consisting of stars and magnetized interstellar medium. In the presence of star burst activities, supernovae, hypernovae, superbubbles etc., our open magnetic field geometry in disc galaxies bears strong implications on circumnuclear and spiral galactic winds.
