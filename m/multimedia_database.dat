40|$|Several {{clustering}} algorithms can {{be applied}} to clustering in large <b>multimedia</b> <b>databases.</b> The effectiveness and efficiency of the existing algorithms, however, is somewhat limited, since clustering in <b>multimedia</b> <b>databases</b> requires clustering high-dimensional feature vectors and since <b>multimedia</b> <b>databases</b> often contain large amounts of noise. In this paper, we therefore introduce a new algorithm to clustering in large <b>multimedia</b> <b>databases</b> called DENCLUE (DENsitybased CLUstEring). The basic idea of our new approach is to model the overall point density analytically as the sum of influence functions of the data points. Clusters can then be identified by determining density-attractors and clusters of arbitrary shape can be easily described by a simple equation based on the overall density function. The advantages of our new approach are (1) it has a firm mathematical basis, (2) it has good clustering properties in data sets with large amounts of noise, (3) it allows a compact mathematical [...] ...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} research {{issue in}} <b>multimedia</b> <b>databases</b> is the retrieval of similar objects. For most applications in <b>multimedia</b> <b>databases,</b> an exact search is not meaningful. Thus, much {{effort has been}} devoted to develop efficient and effective similarity search techniques. A recent approach, that has been shown to improve the effectiveness of similarity search in <b>multimedia</b> <b>databases,</b> resorts to the usage of combinations of metrics where the desirable contribution (weight) of each metric is chosen at query time. This paper presents the Multi-Metric M-tree (M 3 -tree), a metric access method that supports similarity queries with dynamic combinations of metric functions. The M 3 -tree, an extension of the Mtree, stores partial distances to better estimate the weighed distances between routing/ground entries and each query, where a single distance function is used to build the whole index. An experimental evaluation shows that the M 3 -tree may be as efficient as having multiple M-trees (one for each combination of metrics) ...|$|R
