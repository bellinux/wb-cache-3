500|$|Allen Toussaint {{described}} {{learning the}} song as a [...] "rite of passage". [...] The {{subject of the}} song is unknown. Among the speculated subjects are a place and a person. Hugh Laurie recorded a cover of the song {{around the time of}} its selection to the National Recording Registry. He commented about the mystery as follows: [...] "I thought it was better not knowing. It adds to its mystique and its power to <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>laugh</b> and cry all in one go." ...|$|E
500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{gave it a}} {{slightly}} more critical review, awarded it a [...] "B". He compared the episode the third season episode [...] "A Benihana Christmas", writing that [...] "both deal with Michael’s heart being broken and the somewhat self-destructive ways he deals with it." [...] However, {{he felt that the}} episode [...] "struggles greatly if you have no emotional connection to Holly and Michael" [...] because it [...] "isn't funny, by any real stretch of the term, nor is it really intended to be funny." [...] He went on to say [...] "I like episodes like this one in general and don't necessarily need the show to <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>laugh,</b> but I would say that I wanted this hour to be slightly more... pleasant." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Whale Whores" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{described the}} criticism of the save-the-whales conservationists as a [...] "delightfully savage ridicule". Brian Jacks of MTV complimented the show's focus on whale conservation, writing, [...] "Leave it to the hard-hitting folks at South Park to do more for conservationism than fifteen cable reality shows put together." [...] Josh Modell of The A.V. Club said the episode was unfunny and mocked a television series that was [...] "culturally insignificant" [...] and not particularly well-known. Modell wrote, [...] "The show's star, Paul Watson, seems to have really pissed off South Park's creators Parker and Stone [...] Fine, but could you <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>laugh</b> a few times while you beat me {{over the head with}} information about a guy that I couldn't care less about?" ...|$|E

500|$|Public {{reaction}} varied. Some women {{admired her}} strength and poise in private matters {{that were made}} public, some sympathized with her {{as a victim of}} her husband's insensitive behavior, others criticized her as being an enabler to her husband's indiscretions, while still others accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence. Her public approval ratings {{in the wake of the}} revelations shot upward to around 70percent, the highest they had ever been. In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to [...] "a love that has persisted for decades" [...] and add: [...] "No one understands me better and no one can <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>laugh</b> the way Bill does.

500|$|Buddy TV {{senior writer}} Oscar Dahl remarked, [...] "It didn't <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>laugh</b> out loud and, yet, I still loved it." [...] He shed a {{negative}} light on Andy's behavior towards Dwight, calling it [...] "annoying {{and not that}} funny." [...] Dahl hoped Dwight would be reappearing soon, and concluded [...] "Overall, a crucial story episode with a nice cliffhanger. Even if wasn't as funny as last week or even most episodes this season, The Office still entertains." [...] AOL TV's Michael Sciannamea lauded the episode, writing [...] "I cannot remember ever guffawing over every single line in a single sitcom episode as I did watching this one. If the performances in this particular one don't garner the actors in this show a plethora of Emmys, {{there ought to be}} an investigation." [...] Sciannamea continued that he believed it was Steve Carell's best series performance thus far because he [...] "displayed the full range of his personality—jokester, arrogant jerk, charming salesman, sensitive soul, and added a new one—anger." ...|$|E

2500|$|Searching for the Young Soul Rebels was {{released}} to positive reviews from music critics. Melody Maker named {{it one of}} the best albums of 1980 in its year-end list, while NME named it the tenth best album of the year. David Hepworth, however, reviewing the album in Smash Hits, was dismissive and felt that [...] "potentially good songs are dragged down by mannered vocals and would-be epic arrangements". Calling it [...] "a weird record", Robert Christgau wrote: [...] "Never have soul horns sounded remotely as sour, and Kevin Rowland can't carry a tune to the next note. There are horn interjections that <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>laugh</b> out loud at their perfectly timed wrong rightness, and with Kevin Rowland quavering through his deeply felt poesy and everybody else blaring away, I enjoy it {{in much the same way}} I enjoy a no wave band on a good night".|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year, Hanks landed one of {{the lead}} roles, that of character Kip Wilson, on the ABC television pilot of Bosom Buddies.

Hanks had previously partnered with Scolari on the 1970s game show <b>Make</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Laugh.</b> After landing the role, Hanks moved to Los Angeles. Bosom Buddies ran for two seasons, and, although the ratings were never strong, television critics gave the program high marks. [...] "The first day I saw him on the set," [...] co-producer Ian Praiser told Rolling Stone, [...] "I thought, 'Too bad he won't be in television for long.' I knew he'd be a movie star in two years." [...] However, although Praiser knew it, {{he was not able}} to convince Hanks. [...] "The television show had come out of nowhere," [...] Hanks' best friend Tom Lizzio told Rolling Stone.|$|E
2500|$|Elton {{says of his}} {{criticism}} [...] "I would have loved a honeymoon period, but I've been irritating journos from the beginning. Originally I was knocked for being too left-wing, and now apparently I've sold out and I'm too right-wing, but all the time I've been being me, and that certainly isn't the person I recognise in anything that's written about me." [...] He denies being anti-establishment though, [...] "I wrote a sitcom for the BBC when I was 21! [...] How the fuck can I be anti-establishment? From the first interview I ever did, I talked about Morecambe and Wise, and every time {{they wanted me to}} talk about Lenny Bruce I'd say, 'Yeah, he's fine, but he doesn't <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>laugh</b> the way Eric 'n' Ernie do." [...] He also points out he was a socialist at a time when [...] "the media was on the whole slavishly worshipping of Thatcher".

2500|$|Merkerson {{made her}} {{television}} debut as Reba the Mail Lady on Pee-wee's Playhouse. [...] "It {{was one of}} those wild things where I went to audition.

[...] "I didn't know who Pee-wee Herman was, so if, you know, for fans of the show, if they watch like the first episode that I ever did, I think it was a big party and he just kept making me laugh because I had never seen the character before.
