25|$|One common {{faux pas}} on Internet forums is to post {{the same message}} twice. Users {{sometimes}} post versions of a message that are only slightly different, especially in forums where {{they are not allowed}} to edit their earlier posts. <b>Multiple</b> <b>posting</b> instead of editing prior posts can artificially inflate a user's post count. <b>Multiple</b> <b>posting</b> can be unintentional; a user's browser might display an error message even though the post has been transmitted or a user of a slow forum might become impatient and repeatedly hit the submit button. An offline editor may post the same message twice. <b>Multiple</b> <b>posting</b> can also be used as a method of trolling or spreading forum spam. A user may also send the same post to several forums, which is termed crossposting. The term derives from Usenet, where crossposting was an accepted practice but causes problems in web forums, which lack the ability to link such posts so replies in one forum are not visible to people reading the post in other forums.|$|E

40|$|Semantic {{clarity and}} {{completeness}} of idea are two fundamental characteristics {{of virtually all}} forms of continuous writing especially essays, letters and reports. However, multiple post-modification of nominal groups often used to achieve clarity and brevity sometimes subjects ideas to ambiguity thereby making them to be susceptible to double or multiple semantic interpretations. This paper presents {{the outcome of a}} linguistic study of the continuous writing-essays, letters and reports in the scripts of eighty [80] students of The Federal Polytechnic, Ede, Nigeria offering English courses as compulsory minors. The paper identifies <b>multiple</b> <b>post</b> modification in the usage of the English nominal groups and their tendency to lead to ambiguity. A syntactic-semantic analysis of the ambiguous expressions resulting from <b>multiple</b> <b>post</b> modification is presented detailing the sources of ambiguities that arise. Finally, possible disambiguation methods are suggested especially for English as a second language writers and readers...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} the fracture resistance {{of different sizes}} of standardized single fiber posts and the combinations of <b>multiple</b> small experimental <b>posts.</b> METHODS: Single posts in three different sizes (1, 2 and 3; DT Light Posts, RTD; DT), as control, and seven different combinations of experimental small posts (Abrasive Technology), reproducing the sizes of several endodontic files were cemented in endodontic resin blocks. The combinations of small posts were made combining 2 - 4 small posts so as to reach the sizes of standardized DT posts. The posts were loaded at an angle of 45 degrees to the long axis of the block using a crosshead speed of 1 mm/minute until specimen failure. Ten posts/combinations were tested. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tamhane test for the post hoc comparisons (P < 0. 05). RESULTS: For the single posts, fracture resistance increased when increasing {{the diameter of the}} post. The use of <b>multiple</b> <b>posts</b> resulted in fracture resistances comparable to that of the single post for two of the three diameters studied (DT 1 and DT 2). For the largest diameter (DT 3), the use of <b>multiple</b> <b>posts</b> resulted in lower fracture resistances than did the single post...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{mechanical}} behaviour of an endodontic implant, {{based on a}} new restoration technique, is analyzed. It employs <b>multiple</b> prefabricated <b>posts</b> instead of one post {{in such a way}} that the root cavity may be more efficiently filled. From a statical point of view, the use of <b>multiple</b> <b>posts</b> enables an increase of the overall mechanical resistance of the implant. Moreover, as a consequence of the global core-post interfaces increasing, a reduction of the interface shear stress, leading to a reduction of the post pull-out risk, is expected. In order to analyze the statical behaviour of the restoration, three-dimensional nonlinear large-displacement finite-element analyses are performed for several load conditions, both in the case of a double-post restoration and of a single-post one, highlighting the advantages of the new proposed technique...|$|R

40|$|The {{popularity}} of posts, topics, and opinions {{on social media}} websites and the influence ability of users can be discovered by analyzing the responses of users (e. g., likes/dislikes, comments, ratings). Existing web opinion mining systems such as OpinionMiner is based on opinion text similarity scoring of users 2 ̆ 7 review texts and product ratings to generate database table of features, functions and opinions mined through classification to identify arriving opinions as positive or negative on user-service networks or interest networks (e. g., Amazon. com). These systems are not directly applicable to user-user networks or friendship networks (e. g., Facebook. com) since they do not consider <b>multiple</b> <b>posts</b> on <b>multiple</b> products, users 2 ̆ 7 relationships (such as influence), and diverse posts and comments. In this thesis, we propose a new influence network (IN) generation algorithm (Opinion Based IN:OBIN) through opinion mining of friendship networks (like Facebook. com). OBIN mines opinions using extended OpinionMiner that considers <b>multiple</b> <b>posts</b> and relationships (influences) between users. Approach used includes frequent pattern mining algorithm for determining community (positive or negative) preferences for a given product as input to standard influence maximization algorithms like CELF for target marketing. Experiments and evaluations show the effectiveness of OBIN over CELF in large-scale friendship networks.

40|$|The {{experimental}} data, {{relative to}} instantaneous flames evolving downstream a conical bluff body burner, {{have been carried}} out through a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique. Instantaneous and mean properties of the flame are the results of <b>multiple</b> <b>post</b> processing methods applied on Mie scattering images (digital processing) and velocity fields. All these kinds of information are used to determine the non dimensional parameters necessary for a physical description of flame-vortices interaction. We analyse the direct effect of the equivalence ratio (0. 6 <φ< 1. 2), the Reynolds number (4000 <Re< 15000) and the blockage ratio on the kinematical (with PIV) and thermal (with thermocouple) properties of the “hot bubble”, generated by the ring like vortex rotating downstream the conical bluff body. In a second time, we measure the effect of these variations on NOx and CO emission. The dependency of the pollutant emissions on the burner geometry and the flow properties (Re, φ) has been pointed out, allowing us to show the direct effect of the residence time on the Dry Low NOx (DLN) burner.
