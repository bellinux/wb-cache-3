500|$|The scene between Mark and Leslie at the pit was {{mirrored}} {{in the second}} season finale [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", which aired in May 2010 and was Mark's final appearance as a regular cast member. During that scene, the two overlook {{what was once the}} pit, but was now a filled-in lot, and Mark gives her construction plans for a park before kissing her goodbye on the cheek and leaving. Schur said of the scene, [...] "It's great because Leslie and Mark, it was such a disastrous moment last time (at the pit) and he didn't really respect her, and a lot's happened in a year." [...] Goor said of using that setting, [...] "I liked the symmetry of having it play a critical, and opposite role in this finale. Last year, they sat on the bench and kissed, and it seemed like they <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> back together. This year, they sat on the bench and Mark kissed Leslie goodbye." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] was {{the final}} episode to include Paul Schneider in any {{capacity}} after his two seasons as regular cast member as Mark Brendanawicz. Schneider left the series, and though Schur claimed that both the producers and Schneider were interested in having him return for guest appearances in future episodes, Schneider stated {{that he was not}} interested in returning and had never been contacted about it. The final scene between Leslie and Mark in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", in which the two sit together at Lot 48, mirrors their scenes together in the first season finale, [...] "Rock Show", in which the two shared a kiss while overlooking the lot while it was still a construction pit. Schur said of the scene, [...] "It's great because Leslie and Mark, it was such a disastrous moment last time (at the pit) and he didn't really respect her, and a lot's happened in a year."

[...] The bench they sit in during that scene is the same one they sat on during their kiss scene in [...] "Rock Show". Throughout the second season, that bench was in Leslie's office. Schur said, [...] "We decided that in the reality of the show she brought it to the lot for this moment. It's {{a little bit of a}} stretch, but, you know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Disturbed at his son's {{participation}} {{in what he}} considered a [...] "useless" [...] endeavor, Landis's father tried to discourage him from racing his bike by giving him extra chores. This left him no time to train during the day, so he would sneak {{out of the house}} at night to train, sometimes at 1 or 2 a.m. and often in the freezing cold. Landis's father received a tip that his son had been going out at night. He did not appreciate his son's passion for cycling and thought he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> into drugs or alcohol. He often followed Landis at a distance {{to make sure he was}} not getting into trouble. Landis' father later became a hearty supporter of his son and considered himself one of Floyd's biggest fans.|$|E

60|$|Rambonet {{had started}} {{straightway}} for Liege, with this missive; and had duly presented it there, I guess on the 7th,--with {{notice that he}} would wait forty-eight hours, and then return with what answer or no-answer there <b>might</b> <b>be.</b> <b>Getting</b> no written answer, or distinct verbal one; getting only some vague mumblement as good as none, Rambonet had disappeared from Liege on the 9th; and was home at Moyland when Voltaire arrived that Sunday evening,--just walking about to come to heat again, after reporting progress to the above effect.|$|E
60|$|Without staying to make further {{examination}} of Leif's old huts--for {{from the place}} where they stood all the six of them could be clearly seen-- the young pioneers started on their return to the coast. They ran back with much greater speed than they had pushed forward--fearing that their companions <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> impatient or alarmed about them. They did not even converse, but with heads up, chests forward, and elbows bent, addressed themselves to a quick steady run, which soon brought them to the branch of the river previously mentioned.

60|$|He {{realized}} how much he slept, {{and how much he}} desired to sleep. Of old, he had hated sleep. It had robbed him of precious moments of living. Four hours of sleep in the twenty-four had meant being robbed of four hours of life. How he had grudged sleep! Now it was life he grudged. Life was not good; its taste in his mouth was without tang, and bitter. This was his peril. Life that did not yearn toward life was in fair way toward ceasing. Some remote instinct for preservation stirred in him, and he knew he must get away. He glanced about the room, and the thought of packing was burdensome. Perhaps {{it would be better to}} leave that to the last. In the meantime he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> an outfit.|$|E
60|$|Uncle Tom <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> old, but {{he seemed}} to Honora to be of the same age as in her childhood. Some people never grow old, and Uncle Tom was one of these. Fifteen years before he had been {{promoted}} to be the cashier of the Prairie Bank, and he was the cashier to-day. He had the same quiet smile, the same quiet humour, the same calm acceptance of life. He seemed to bear no grudge even against that ever advancing enemy, the soot, which made it increasingly difficult for him to raise his flowers. Those which would still grow he washed tenderly night and morning with his watering-pot. The greatest wonders are not at the ends of the earth, but near us. It was to take many years for our heroine to realize this.|$|E
60|$|How did one grow old-how {{could one}} become confident? He wished he felt older. Why, what {{difference}} was there, {{as far as}} he felt matured or completed, between him now and him at his own wedding? He <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> married over again--he and his wife. He felt himself tiny, a little, upright figure on a plain circled round with the immense, roaring sky: he and his wife, two little, upright figures walking across this plain, whilst the heavens shimmered and roared about them. When did one come to an end? In which direction was it finished? There was no end, no finish, only this roaring vast space. Did one never get old, never die? That was the clue. He exulted strangely, with torture. He would go on with his wife, he and she like two children camping in the plains. What was sure but the endless sky? But that was so sure, so boundless.|$|E

60|$|Rumour of the Pennycoops' visit {{flew through}} the parish. Other ladies felt it their duty to show to Mrs. Pennycoop {{that she was not}} the only Christian in Wychwood-on-the-Heath. Mrs. Pennycoop, it was feared, <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> a swelled head over this matter. The Rev. Augustus, with pardonable pride, {{repeated}} {{some of the things that}} Mrs. Pennycoop had said to him. Mrs. Pennycoop was not to imagine herself the only person in Wychwood-on-the-Heath capable of generosity that cost nothing. Other ladies could say graceful nothings--could say them even better. Husbands dressed in their best clothes and carefully rehearsed were brought in to grace the almost endless procession of disconsolate parishioners hammering at the door of St. Jude's parsonage. Between Thursday morning and Saturday night the Rev. Augustus, much to his own astonishment, had been forced to the conclusion that five-sixths of his parishioners had loved him from the first without hitherto having had opportunity of expressing their real feelings.|$|E
6000|$|But she was {{interrupted}} by a visitor. It was the editor and proprietor of the SAGAMORE. He had happened into Lakeside to pay a duty-call upon an obscure grandmother of his who was nearing the end of her pilgrimage, and with the idea of combining business with grief he had looked up the Fosters, who had been so absorbed in other things {{for the past four years}} that they neglected to pay up their subscription. Six dollars due. No visitor could have been more welcome. He would know all about Uncle Tilbury and what his chances <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> to be, cemeterywards. They could, of course, ask no questions, for that would squelch the bequest, but they could nibble around on the edge of the subject and hope for results. The scheme did not work. The obtuse editor did not know he was being nibbled at; but at last, chance accomplished what art had failed in.

This was the true and only doctor who had saved Mr. Keller's life, when the poor helpless fools about his bed had given him up for lost! The Mistress, the dear Mistress, was as good as cured already. Not a drop more of her precious blood should be shed by the miscreant, who had opened his knife and wounded her. Oh, of all the colors in the world, there's no color like blue! Of all the friends in the world, there never was such a good friend as this! He kissed and hugged the bottle {{as if it had been}} a living thing. He jumped up and danced about the room with it in his arms. Ha! what music there was in the inner gurgling and splashing of the shaken liquid, which told him that there was still some left for the Mistress! The striking of the clock on the mantelpiece sobered him at the height of his ecstasy. It told him that time was passing. Minute by minute, Death <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> nearer and nearer to her; and there he was, with Life in his possession, wasting the time, far from her bedside.|$|E

60|$|After {{receiving}} Mr. Pyncheon's message, {{the carpenter}} merely tarried {{to finish a}} small job, which he happened to have in hand, and then took his way towards the House of the Seven Gables. This noted edifice, though its style <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> {{a little out of}} fashion, was still as respectable a family residence as that of any gentleman in town. The present owner, Gervayse Pyncheon, was said to have contracted a dislike to the house, in consequence of a shock to his sensibility, in early childhood, from the sudden death of his grandfather. In the very act of running to climb Colonel Pyncheon's knee, the boy had discovered the old Puritan to be a corpse. On arriving at manhood, Mr. Pyncheon had visited England, where he married a lady of fortune, and had subsequently spent many years, partly in the mother country, and partly in various cities on the continent of Europe. During this period, the family mansion had been consigned to the charge of a kinsman, who was allowed to make it his home for the time being, in consideration of keeping the premises in thorough repair. So faithfully had this contract been fulfilled, that now, as the carpenter approached the house, his practised eye could detect nothing to criticise in its condition. The peaks of the seven gables rose up sharply; the shingled roof looked thoroughly water-tight; and the glittering plaster-work entirely covered the exterior walls, and sparkled in the October sun, {{as if it had been}} new only a week ago.|$|E
60|$|Little did we, {{or could}} we, {{anticipate}} all that lay before us. The wind held at north-west until {{the ship had}} got within twenty miles of the Welsh coast; then, it came out light, again, at the southward. We were now so near Liverpool, that I expected, every hour, to make some American bound in. None was seen, notwithstanding, and we stood up channel, edging over towards the Irish coast at the same time, determined to work {{our way to the}} northward as well as we could. This sort of weather continued for two days and nights, during which we managed to get up as high as Whitehaven, when the wind came dead ahead, blowing a stiff breeze. I foresaw from the commencement of this new wind, that it would probably drive us down channel, and out into the Atlantic once more, unless we could anchor. I thought I would attempt the last, somewhere under the Irish coast, in the hope of getting some assistance from among the children of St. Patrick. We all knew that Irish sailors, half the time, were not very well trained, but anything that could pull and haul would be invaluable to us, in heavy weather. We had now been more than a week, four of us in all, working the ship, and, instead of being in the least fagged, we had rather got settled into our places, as it <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> <b>getting</b> along without much trouble; still, there were moments when a little extra force would be of great moment to us, and I could see by the angry look of the skies, that these moments were likely to increase in frequency and in the magnitude of their importance to us.|$|E

"But even if {{they could}} not get up in the daylight, they could crawl up at night and finish us, or they could camp down {{at the mouth of the}} ravine and starve us out, for there was no chance of our {{climbing}} the sides, even if my leg had been all right. I was mighty sorry for the chief. He had just thrown his life away, and it must come to the same in the end, as far as I was concerned. Even now he could get away if he chose, but I knew well enough it weren't any good talking to him. So I lay there, just listening for the crack of his rifle above. He would bring down the first man that came in, sartin, and there would be plenty of time after that to get me up beside him, for they would be sure to have a long talk before they made any move. I did not expect them until late in the afternoon, and hoped it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> dark before they got down into the valley. There had been a big wind sweeping down it since the snow had fallen, and though it had drifted deep along the sides, the bottom was for the most part bare. I noticed that the chief had picked his way carefully, and guessed that, as they would have no reason for thinking we were near, they might not take up the trail till morning. Of course they would find our fire and the dead bear, or all that there was left of him, and they would fancy we had only stopped to take a meal and had gone on again. They would see by the fire that we had left pretty early in the day. I heard nothing of the chief until it began to get dark; then he came down to me.|$|E
