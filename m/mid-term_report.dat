30|$|The HFA <b>mid-term</b> <b>report</b> {{also calls}} {{attention}} {{to the lack of}} funding to support community implementation, an important impediment to realizing progress at the community level. In the HFA <b>mid-term</b> <b>report,</b> the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies expressed the related concern that “national planning and decision-making often does not take into consideration the needs and capacities of the most vulnerable, so resources and support are not provided to enable and empower those who need it most” (UNISDR 2011, p. 49). Without funding streams to “explicitly put disaster risk reduction on the agenda of local governments, it is unlikely to achieve the mainstreaming required for effective local action unless local voices are sufficiently strong to advocate for a prioritization of resources at the local government level in favour of disaster risk reduction” (UNISDR 2011, p. 48). These statements raise the real concern that without better funding, local-level implementation is likely to continue to lag behind national and international plans.|$|E

On the basis of the partial equilibrium model ESIM this article analyses potential consequences of different options for a reformed CAP. While the impact on agricultural markets will be relatively small, the financial burden of a harmonisation of agricultural policies and an {{introduction of}} direct payments in the new member states has to be carried mainly by the old member states of the EU- 15. The burden of the main net-payers, especially Germany, would be significantly lower, if CAP were reformed according to the proposals of the EU-Commission's <b>Mid-term</b> <b>Report.</b> However, the remaining negative impacts on world agricultural trade and on world market prices for agricultural products, clearly show the necessity of a further reform of the CAP.

40|$|Capstone design courses {{typically}} involve {{many groups}} of students all working on identical design projects. This approach leads to fierce competitiveness between groups for limited resources, in terms of library materials, computer resources, instructor feedback, and innovative ideas. At the same time, employers are looking for ìteam playersî who can work cooperatively with other employees from all departments for the overall good of the company. The standard approach to process design instruction also yields {{a large number of}} very similar reports, which can be quite tedious to evaluate. Another difficulty encountered in many capstone design courses is the wide variety of (ABET required) topics covered, which leaves many students wondering how they are all related and what relevance each has to the overall design process. This semester a novel approach was investigated, wherein each design group was assigned to study a different production process within the petrochemical industry. The projects were inter-related through feeds and products, just as different production facilities are inter-connected within a large chemical processing complex. Students completed <b>mid-term</b> <b>reports</b> that analyzed different aspects of their process and produced a final report that encompassed their full semesterís work.
