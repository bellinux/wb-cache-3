40|$|High {{accuracy}} in working lining wear rate measurements of a <b>metallurgical</b> <b>vessel</b> is very essential. If the molten steel burns through the vessel because of excessive lining wear, the consequences may be substantial losses in production, {{damage to the}} instrumentation, and equipment and danger to the staff. Such lining measurements are done with laser scanning equipment. The positioning of the vessel for the laser scanning is done with a CCD-camera. Each vessel contains a positioning plate, which is a planar object containing four rings at the corners. A procedure realised with a special image processing hardware locates the rings on a rectangular plane with known dimensions. With that information {{the position of the}} <b>metallurgical</b> <b>vessel</b> is calculated before each laser scanning. The ring search method is based on cross-correlation, which is a very accurate method in 2 D situations. There is, however, a problem of the perspective projection of the ring at different angles, which causes a [...] ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThree novel {{applications}} of {{surface acoustic wave}} (SAW) sensor systems in the steel industry are presented: radio frequency identification (RFID) and temperature monitoring of slide gate plates, monitoring of the temperature inside a lining of a <b>metallurgical</b> <b>vessel</b> and RFID tagging of slag ladles. The motivation, the system requirements and constraints of the sensor design and the sensor integration are discussed. Results of field trials of the SAW sensor systems within the steel plants are presented...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{wireless}} {{sensor system}} based on surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology has been developed to measure the temperature inside a refractory lining of a <b>metallurgical</b> <b>vessel.</b> The components of the sensor unit are designed for harsh environments to withstand moisture and high temperatures. The sensor signal, which contains an identification number and the temperature, is transmitted through the steel shell of the vessel via a robust cable link from the SAW sensor to the transponder antenna. A continuous wave reader unit interrogates the sensor unit and processes the signal for the recording unit. The sensor unit has been tested in a drying sequence of a castable refractory lining. The design of the sensor unit {{and the results are}} presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSome {{refractory}} linings of <b>metallurgical</b> <b>vessels</b> {{consist of}} masonry. To model these large-sized structures, it is {{convenient to use}} an equivalent material instead of a model that involves all bricks and joints. The properties of the equivalent material depend on geometrical and mechanical properties of the bricks, the joint states and the temperature. In this paper, several joint states which are the combinations of open/closed states of bed and head joints are considered. The equivalent material properties are determined thanks to periodic homogenization techniques. Results obtained with this approach are used to model different masonries walls, with or without mortar, subjected to bi-axial compression and bending. Finally, an application to a coke oven heatingwall is presented...|$|R
