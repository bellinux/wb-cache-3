5|$|Dunball wharf {{was built}} in 1844 by Bridgwater coal <b>merchants,</b> <b>and</b> {{was linked to the}} Bristol and Exeter Railway by a rail track which crossed the A38. The link {{was built in}} 1876, also by coal <b>merchants,</b> <b>and</b> was {{originally}} operated as a horse-drawn tramway. In 1875, the local landowner built The Dunball Steam Pottery & Brick & Tile Works adjacent to the wharf.|$|E
5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between <b>merchants</b> <b>and</b> protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans would order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would continue in a controlled manner for a couple of weeks and then all controls would be taken off, at which point the <b>merchants</b> <b>and</b> protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate the results. Also as part of the agreement, the media was to be informed of the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.|$|E
5|$|Armenian {{churches were}} {{constructed}} during that period, including the St. James Monastery. The latter was last expanded in the mid-12th century. An Armenian scriptorium was in operation by the mid-fifth century. A secular community composed of <b>merchants</b> <b>and</b> artisans {{was established in}} the sixth century in the Zion Quarter, where an Armenian street existed (Ruda Armeniorum).|$|E

5|$|Bulgarian {{nationalism}} gradually {{emerged during}} the mid-19th century with the economic upsurge of Bulgarian <b>merchants</b> <b>and</b> craftsmen, the development of Bulgarian-funded popular education, the struggle for an autonomous Bulgarian Church and political actions towards {{the formation of a}} separate Bulgarian state. The First and Second Serbian Uprisings had laid the foundation of an autonomous Serbia during the late 1810s, and Greece had been established as an independent state in 1832, {{in the wake of the}} Greek War of Independence. However, support for gaining independence through an armed struggle against the Ottomans was not universal. Revolutionary sentiment was concentrated largely among the more educated and urban sectors of the populace. There was less support for an organized revolt among the peasantry and the wealthier <b>merchants</b> <b>and</b> traders, who feared that Ottoman reprisals would jeopardize economic stability and widespread rural land ownership.|$|E

5|$|In 1247 Odense {{was burned}} by Abel of Denmark during {{conflicts}} {{with his brother}} King Erik IV. The cathedral had to be completely rebuilt. Nevertheless, the town continued to flourish as a commercial centre, and was charted in 1335. The city thrived economically during the Middle Ages, attracting many <b>merchants</b> <b>and</b> craftsman who traded their goods.|$|E

5|$|Mongolia's central {{geographical}} {{position on}} the Asian continent was an important reason why {{it was able to}} play such a large role in the trade system. The Mongol army was easily able to assert strong rule throughout most of the empire. The military ensured that supply lines and trade routes flowed smoothly; permanent garrisons were established along trade routes to protect the travellers on these routes. Complex local systems of taxation and extortion that were prevalent before Mongol rule were abolished to ensure the smooth flow of <b>merchants</b> <b>and</b> trade through the empire. A system of weights-and-measures was also standardised. To make the voyage on the trade routes less harrowing, the Mongols went as far as to plant trees along the roads to shade the <b>merchants</b> <b>and</b> travellers in the summer months; stone pillars were used to mark the roads where trees could not grow.|$|E
5|$|Rugby was {{introduced}} to France in 1872 by English <b>merchants</b> <b>and</b> students. On 26 February 1890, a French rugby team recruited from the Janson Desailly Lyceum defeated an international team at the Bois de Boulogne.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} events, {{possibly}} on the 29 July whilst still in Beaucaire, Napoleon wrote a political pamphlet titled Le souper de Beaucaire (The supper at Beaucaire) {{in which a}} soldier speaks with four <b>merchants</b> <b>and,</b> sympathetic to their opinions, attempts to dissipate their counter-revolutionary sentiments.|$|E

5|$|Some Athenian citizen {{women were}} <b>merchants,</b> <b>and</b> Athenian law forbade {{criticism}} of anyone (male or female) for selling in the marketplace.

5|$|The Arabic {{language}} and the Muslim religion continued to be spread in South Sudan by <b>merchants</b> <b>and</b> administrators from the North, and even by British officials who preferred to speak Arabic rather than learn the local language.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{had been}} a part of Hawaii's culture since the late 18th century, when the islands were first visited by Chinese <b>merchants</b> <b>and</b> tradesmen. In 1852, sugar {{plantations}} began recruiting unskilled labor from China. Because these men initially intended to return to China upon the completion of their contracts, most came without families.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they were}} still allies, San Martín began to {{distance}} himself from Alvear, who controlled the Assembly and the lodge. Alvear opposed the <b>merchants</b> <b>and</b> the Uruguayan caudillo José Gervasio Artigas, San Martín thought that it was risky to open such conflicts when the royalists were still a threat. The Army of the North, which was operating at the Upper Peru, was defeated at the battles of Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, so the triumvirate appointed San Martín to head it, replacing Manuel Belgrano.|$|E
5|$|As {{the river}} {{frontage}} areas of Alabama and Mississippi were settled by planters {{who developed the}} cotton plantation economy {{with the use of}} slave labor, Mobile's population exploded. It came to be settled by attorneys, cotton factors, doctors, <b>merchants</b> <b>and</b> other professionals seeking to capitalize on trade with the upriver areas. Mobile was well situated for trade, as its location tied it to a river system that served as the principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi. By 1822 the city's population was 2800.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1875 as the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland, Temple Sinai is {{the oldest}} synagogue in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area. It grew out of Oakland's Hebrew Benevolent Society, which had been {{organized}} in 1862 by eighteen <b>merchants</b> <b>and</b> shopkeepers from several foreign countries—predominantly Polish Jews from Posen. Although Hebrew Benevolent Societies typically ceased operations upon the founding of a synagogue, Oakland's was unusual in continuing to function independently {{for a number of}} years (the two groups did not merge until 1881).|$|E

5|$|George Koval's father, Abram Koval, {{left his}} home town of Telekhany in Belarus to immigrate to the United States in 1910.

He and his wife Ethel Shenitsky Koval raised three sons: Isaya, born 1912; George (or Zhorzh), born Christmas 1913; and Gabriel, born 1919.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to natural calamities and jiedushi amassing autonomous control, the Huang Chao Rebellion (874–884) {{resulted in the}} sacking of both Chang'an and Luoyang, and took an entire decade to suppress. Although the rebellion was defeated by the Tang, it never recovered from that crucial blow, weakening it for the future military powers to take over. There were also large groups of bandits, {{in the size of}} small armies, that ravaged the countryside {{in the last years of}} the Tang, who smuggled illicit salt, ambushed <b>merchants</b> <b>and</b> convoys, and even besieged several walled cities.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the {{increasing}} wealth of middle class <b>merchants</b> <b>and</b> traders meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy, {{and threatened to}} break {{down some of the}} symbolic barriers between the nobility and the lower classes. The response came in two forms: didactic literature warning of the dangers of adapting a diet inappropriate for one's class, and sumptuary laws that put a cap on the lavishness of commoners' banquets.|$|E
