5|$|Along with Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara!, Chennai Express was {{initially}} abandoned by Pakistani distributors and exhibitors because four Pakistani films were released {{on the same}} day. The release dates were postponed to 15 and 9 August, respectively. During its Wai schedule of filming, the film's unit ran into trouble for using too <b>much</b> <b>water</b> from Dhom Dam, in the drought-stricken Satara district of Maharashtra. The state's relief and rehabilitation minister, Patangrao Kadam, addressed the problem.|$|E

5|$|September 16, 1999– Hurricane Floyd {{crosses the}} entire state as a {{tropical}} storm, unleashing torrential rainfall amounting {{to a maximum of}} 13.34inches (33.88cm) in Somerville. Cape May reports a storm surge of 2.6feet (.79m). Five rivers, including the Raritan River, withhold too <b>much</b> <b>water</b> and exceed flood stages. Strong wind gusts leave over 650,000citizens without power during the storm's passage. Floyd caused great damage in the state and six casualties.|$|E
5|$|Horseshoe crabs convert {{nitrogenous}} wastes to ammonia {{and dump}} it via their gills, and excrete other wastes as feces via the anus. They also have nephridia ("little kidneys"), which extract other wastes for excretion as urine. Ammonia is so toxic {{that it must}} be diluted rapidly with large quantities of water. Most terrestrial chelicerates cannot afford to use so <b>much</b> <b>water</b> and therefore convert nitrogenous wastes to other chemicals, which they excrete as dry matter. Extraction is by various combinations of nephridia and Malpighian tubules. The tubules filter wastes out of the blood and dump them into the hindgut as solids, a system that has evolved independently in insects and several groups of arachnids.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, China led {{the world}} in {{renewable}} energy production, with a total capacity of 378 GW, mainly from hydroelectric and wind power. As of 2014, China leads {{the world in}} the production and use of wind power, solar photovoltaic power and smart grid technologies, generating almost as <b>much</b> <b>water,</b> wind and solar energy as all of France and Germany's power plants combined. China's renewable energy sector is growing faster than its fossil fuels and nuclear power capacity. Since 2005, production of solar cells in China has expanded 100-fold. As Chinese renewable manufacturing has grown, the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped. Innovation has helped, but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion.|$|E

5|$|The Achaeans were {{demoralized}} by this battle; Aratus {{declined the}} generalship, and when both Athens and the Aetolian League turned down their appeals, they sued Cleomenes for peace. Initially, Cleomenes advanced only minor requests, {{but as the}} talks continued, his demands became greater and he eventually insisted that leadership of the League be surrendered to him. In exchange, {{he would return to}} the Achaeans the prisoners and strongholds he had seized. The Achaeans invited Cleomenes to Lerna, where they were holding council. While marching there, Cleomenes drank too <b>much</b> <b>water,</b> which caused him to lose his voice and cough up blood—a situation that forced him to return to Sparta.|$|E

5|$|With the {{introduction}} of non-native species, predominantly giant reed, castor bean and tobacco tree, native plant species in the watershed began to die out. As giant reed is not suitable habitat for many species, areas infested by giant reed are biologically dead in comparison with unaffected areas. It can grow extremely fast, removing too <b>much</b> <b>water</b> from the creek, and during flood events, {{many parts of the}} giant reed can wash downstream and re-establish themselves as a new colony, increasing the problem. Along with increasing concentrations of nutrients from fertilizer and other substances contained in runoff, algal blooms began to hurt the water quality of the creek, especially above Sulphur Creek Reservoir. The historically seasonal creek was replaced with a constant flow of polluted water from several large storm drains and many smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|A single {{spotted hyena}} can eat at least 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although spotted hyenas act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than by {{fighting}} as lions do. When feeding on an intact carcass, spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the abdominal cavity and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace. Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted hyenas do not require <b>much</b> <b>water,</b> and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E
5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How <b>much</b> <b>water</b> vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E

5|$|Although {{adapted to}} {{terrestrial}} life, frogs resemble freshwater fish in {{their inability to}} conserve body water effectively. When they are on land, <b>much</b> <b>water</b> is lost by evaporation from the skin. The excretory system {{is similar to that}} of mammals and there are two kidneys that remove nitrogenous products from the blood. Frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic products from the kidney tubules. The nitrogen is excreted as ammonia by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as urea, a less toxic product, by most terrestrial adults. A few species of tree frog with little access to water excrete the even less toxic uric acid. The urine passes along paired ureters to the urinary bladder from which it is vented periodically into the cloaca. All bodily wastes exit the body through the cloaca which terminates in a cloacal vent.|$|E
5|$|By 01:00, {{there was}} too <b>much</b> <b>water</b> in the hull for the pumps to handle. Water began to enter the forward {{generator}} compartments, which forced the crew to work by candlelight. Lützow was so low in the water by 01:30 that water began to flood the forward boiler room. By that point, {{almost all of the}} compartments in the forward part of the ship, up to the conning tower and below the main armored deck, were thoroughly flooded. Water had also entered the ship through shell holes in the forecastle above the armored deck; the majority of the upper portion of the ship forward of the forward-most barbette was flooded as well. The battlecruiser's crew attempted to patch the shell holes three times, but as the flooding worsened and the draft increased, water increasingly washed over the deck and inhibited progress on the repair work. The crew attempted to reverse direction and steam backwards, but this had to be abandoned when the bow became so submerged that the propellers were pulled partially out of the water; forward draft had increased to over 17meters.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{conserve}} heat {{by reducing}} {{the flow of blood}} to their skin and lose heat by evaporation through their mouths. Cats have minimal ability to sweat, with glands located primarily in their paw pads, and pant for heat relief only at very high temperatures (but may also pant when stressed). A cat's body temperature does not vary throughout the day; this is part of cats' general lack of circadian rhythms and may reflect their tendency to be active both during the day and at night. Cats' feces are comparatively dry and their urine is highly concentrated, both of which are adaptations to allow cats to retain as <b>much</b> <b>water</b> as possible. Their kidneys are so efficient, they can survive on a diet consisting only of meat, with no additional water, and can even rehydrate by drinking seawater. While domestic cats are able to swim, they are generally reluctant to enter water as it quickly leads to exhaustion.|$|E

5|$|The High Seas Fleet {{managed to}} punch through the British light forces without drawing the {{attention}} of Jellicoe's battleships, and subsequently reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. Off Helgoland, Grosser Kurfürst had taken in so <b>much</b> <b>water</b> that {{she was forced to}} reduce speed. She fell out of formation, but later rejoined the fleet outside the Schillig roadstead. Upon reaching Wilhelmshaven, Grosser Kurfürst went into harbor while several other battleships took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead. The ship was transferred to Hamburg where she was repaired in AG Vulcan's large floating dock. Repair work was completed by 16 July. In the course of the battle, Grosser Kurfürst fired a total of 135 shells from her main battery and 216 rounds from her 15cm guns. She was hit by eight large-caliber shells, which killed fifteen men and wounded ten.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeated}} army suffered greatly, {{not only}} from the Byzantine pursuit, but also due to lack of water: before the battle, Kardarigan had ordered the water supplies poured to the ground, trying to make his men fight harder to break through the Byzantine army and reach the Arzamon. In addition, the surviving Persians were refused entry into Dara since, according to Simocatta, Persian custom forbade entrance to fugitives. Simocatta also narrates that many Persians died of thirst or from water poisoning when they drank too <b>much</b> <b>water</b> from wells after their ordeal. Kardarigan himself had managed to find refuge on a nearby hilltop with a small detachment and withstood several Byzantine attacks. Finally, after three or four days, the Byzantines, not aware that the enemy commander was there, abandoned the effort. Kardarigan thus escaped, although his men suffered further casualties in the process, up to a thousand according to Simocatta, from Byzantine patrols.|$|E
5|$|The few {{men who had}} {{not been}} wounded because they were manning the ships during the battle were {{reinforced}} with three men who had suffered relatively minor wounds; they put ashore at a remote beach to dig for water. They found some and brought it back to the ships, although it sickened those who drank it. The two ships sailed through a storm for two days and nights; Alaminos, the pilot, then steered a course for Florida, where they found good drinking water, although they lost one man to the local Indians and another drank so <b>much</b> <b>water</b> that he died. The ships finally made port in Cuba, where Hernández de Cordóba wrote a report to Governor Velázquez describing the voyage, the cities, the plantations, and, most importantly, the discovery of gold. Hernández died soon after from his wounds. The two captured Maya survived the voyage to Cuba and were interrogated; they swore that there was abundant gold in Yucatán.|$|E
