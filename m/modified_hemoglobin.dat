50|$|The {{impact of}} sickle cell trait on malaria {{immunity}} illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs {{that have occurred}} because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes {{a change in the}} hemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow capillaries; however, when the <b>modified</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> S molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape. In these strands the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are homozygous (with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta allele) have sickle-cell anaemia, while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavor the trait's survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the benefits provided by the heterozygous form.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Severe anemia is a {{major cause}} of death in falciparum malaria. Blood {{transfusion}} increases survival in humans and in animal models of this disease. Because of logistic constraints and viral contamination of the blood supply, transfusions are frequently not practical in endemic regions. <b>Modified</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> is an effective O 2 carrier in hemorrhagic shock. It is free of infectious contamination, may not require refrigeration, and because of its nitric oxide scavenging and small size, may have pharmacologic benefits in malaria. The effects of transfusions of <b>modified</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> in rats with high-grade parasitemia were evaluated. <b>Modified</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> decreased lactic acidosis and corrected anemia as well as transfusions with red blood cells; these findings may correlate with improved survival and suggest a possible proerythropoietic effect. Further study of this novel therapy is warranted. Plasmodium species cause more than two million deaths per year worldwide; at least 30 – 40 % of P. falciparum-re-lated deaths are secondary to severe anemia. 1, 2 Anemia is caused by hemolysis, erythrophagocytosis, dyserythropoies-is, and sequestration of infected red blood cells (RBCs) in peripheral vessels. 3 – 5 Blood transfusion for the treatment of severe malaria anemia decreases mortality in some patient...|$|E

40|$|<b>Modified</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> {{red blood}} cell {{substitutes}} {{have a number of}} potential areas of application. In some of these applications, it will be important to lessen the pro-oxidant effects of hemoglobin and potential free radical-mediated toxicity. This research introduces a novel <b>modified</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> that is based on intermolecularly crosslinking hemoglobin, superoxide dismutase and catalase (PolyHb-SOD-CAT) with the bifunctional agent, glutaraldehyde. Superoxide dismutase and catalase catalyze the breakdown of superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide respectively. Studies of structural and functional parameters reveal that PolyHb-SOD-CAT retains superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymatic activity, and consists of a mixture of molecular species ranging in molecular size and protein composition. Circulation time studies of PolyHb-SOD-CAT in rats show that hemoglobin, superoxide dismutase and catalase possess longer circulatory half-lives as compared to the free forms of these proteins. Studies also show that PolyHb-SOD-CAT prevents the formation of methemoglobin, ferrylhemoglobin, hydroxyl radical, free iron, and lipid peroxidation. Ischemia-reperfusion studies using isolated perfused hindlimbs and intestine of rat show that PolyHb-SOD-CAT reduced the formation of hydroxyl radical compared to PolyHb. Altogether, these results suggest that PolyHb-SOD-CAT is a potentially safer <b>modified</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> oxygen carrier by virtue of its ability to detoxify reactive oxygen species, and reduced propensity to promote and participate in oxidative processes...|$|E

Impaired absorption can be excluded as a factor of any significance in certain experiments given above.

40|$|The {{major goal}} {{of the present study}} is to {{describe}} the mechanisms by which plants adapt to deficiencies in the electron transport chain, either in terms of lack of the functional electron transport complex or lack of final electron acceptor (oxygen). In plants, the main function of class 1 hemoglobins is to scavenge nitric oxide (NO). Under hypoxia and anoxia, there is a significant increase in hemoglobin expression which upregulates the turnover of the Hb-NO cycle. This cycle not only participates in the electron transport chain, but NO influences various signalling processes which govern plant development, morphology and physiology. The current study demonstrates that NO produced under hypoxia induces AOX 1 A gene expression, which is translated to a higher AOX activity and leads to a shift towards biosynthesis of amino acids. It also demonstrates that respiratory complex I deficiency results in low NO levels and upregulation of fermentation pathways. The current study undertakes extensive efforts to characterise the morphological, biochemical and physiological effects of <b>modified</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> expression in barley.

40|$|During {{aging in}} vivo and in vitro, {{erythrocytes}} display removal signals. Phagocytosis is triggered by binding of autologous IgG to a senescent cell antigen originating on band 3. Erythrocytes generate vesicles {{as an integral}} part of the aging process in vivo and in vitro, i. e. during storage. These vesicles display senescent cell antigens as well as phosphatidylserine, that is recognized by scavenger receptors. Recent comparative proteomic analyses of erythrocytes and their vesicles support the hypothesis that aging is accompanied by increased binding of <b>modified</b> <b>hemoglobins</b> to band 3, disruption of the band 3 -mediated anchorage of the cytoskeleton to the lipid bilayer, vesicle formation, and antigenic changes in band 3 conformation.

40|$|A {{hydrogen}} exchange (HX) functional labeling {{method was}} used to study allosterically active segments in human hemoglobin (Hb) at the a-chain N terminus and the b-chain C terminus. Allosterically important interactions that contact these segments were removed one or more at a time by mutation (Hbs Cowtown, Bunbury, Barcelona, Kariya), proteol-ysis (desArg 141 a, desHis 146 b), chemical modification (N-ethylsuccinimi-dyl-Cys 93 b), and the withdrawal of extrinsic effectors (phosphate groups, chloride). The effects of each modification on HX rate at the local and the remote position were measured in the deoxy Hb T-state and translated into change in structural free energy at each position. The removal of individual salt links destabilizes local structure by 0. 4 to 0. 75 kcal/mol (pH 7. 4, 0 C, 0. 35 M ionic strength) and often produces cross-subunit effects while hemoglobin remains in the T-state. In doubly <b>modified</b> <b>hemoglobins,</b> different changes that break the same links pro-duce identical destabilization, changes that are structurally independent show energetic additivity, and changes that intersect show energetic overlap. For the overall T-state to R-state transition and for some but not all modifications within the T-state, the summed loss in stabilization free energy measured at the two chain termini matches the total loss in allo-steric free energy measured by global methods.

40|$|Anoxia-reoxygenation {{leads to}} severe {{metabolic}} alterations, which {{result in a}} generalized inflammatory reaction and multiple organ dysfunction. Direct blood transfusion limits these alterations, but is accompanied by risk of transmission of infections or viral diseases. To avoid these risks, "blood substitutes" have been designed. The modified hemoglobins are not true blood substitutes {{because they do not}} possess the complex functions of erythrocytes. They are only oxygen carriers, with a short intravascular life, adapted for temporary use. They are stable, devoid of toxicity and antigenicity, and are able to carry and deliver O 2 without regulation of this oxygen transport and without chemical reaction with O 2. They possess rheologic properties and an oncotic pressure like those of blood. The use of natural hemoglobin solutions, obtained after lysis of erythrocytes, remains "at risk" because these solutions easily form methemoglobin, increase the oncotic pressure, present renal toxicity, and possess a too high affinity for O 2. For these reasons, 5 types of <b>modified</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> solutions have been designed, prepared from human or bovine hemoglobin or by genetic engineering. These hemoglobins are highly purified to eliminate trace amounts of stroma, lipids and endotoxins, which are responsible for acute toxicity. They are modified by internal cross-linking between the monomers, or by binding to macromolecules. Afterwards, they can be polymerized or encapsulated in liposomes. The purpose of these modifications is to modulate the affinity for O 2 (by decreasing the binding of O 2 and increasing its delivery to tissue), to reduce the dissociation into monomers and to guard against oxidation into methemoglobin. Encapsulation in liposomes allows co-encapsulation of effector molecules and protective substances. Genetic engineering allows the production of recombinant hemoglobin with selective modifications. The <b>modified</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> solutions are essentially used in hemorrhagic shock and perioperative hemodilution. Experimental work in animals has afforded good results: restoration of normal O 2 pressure and no toxicity. These assays allow frequent observation of an unexpected rapid hypertensive effect, transient, reversible, and that could be controlled by antihypertensive drugs. The mechanisms of this hypertensive effect remain controverted (stimulation of endothelin production, inhibition of nitric oxide effects, etc.). In humans, studies with healthy volunteers have been completed, while phase II clinical studies are under way in hypovolemic shock, in major abdominal, orthopedic and cardiac surgery, in stroke and in intensive care patients after surgery.

40|$|Background: Hemoglobin adducts are {{considered}} suitable biomarkers to evaluate human exposure to electrophile agents. One {{of the procedures}} used for the molecular dosimetry of hemoglobin adducts is the enzymatic digestion of the protein and the subsequent quantification of modified peptides by mass spectrometry. Due to {{the low level of}} <b>modified</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> peptides with respect to the corresponding unmodified ones, for the detection of adducts, samples must be enriched for them. Objectives: Within this item, hemoglobin was digested with Calpain I and the study was divided into two phases. Firstly we characterized proteolytic sites on pure hemoglobin, then we evaluate the ability of Calpain to discriminate between normal and alkylated globin chains. Methods: Digestions of pure hemoglobin sample and of an alkylated one with Calpain I at 200 : 1 and 25 : 1 weight ratios, for 1, 5 and 18 hrs were carried out. Results: By using a 200 : 1 weight ratio only peptides a(1 - 137), a(1 - 138) and b(1 - 142) were produced, pointing out that the first proteolytic sites are located at the C-terminus ends of both a- and b-chains. The identification of peptides obtained from the 25 : 1 digestions allowed the determination of internal secondary proteolytic sites, not reported in literature. In both cases, a non-negligible proteolysis was observed only when a reaction time of 18 hrs was used.

40|$|Human hemoglobin, reacted at {{the four}} amino termini with 4 -isothiocyanatobenzenesulphonic acid (Hb-ICBS), was {{separated}} into its constituent chains. Recombination of the ICBS-reacted chains with the unmodified mate chains produced the hybrid tetramers modified at either the beta or the alpha chains: alpha 2 beta 2 ICBS and alpha 2 ICBS beta 2. All of the modified tetramers show a reduced oxygen affinity and reduced cooperativity; furthermore the oxygen affinity of the Hb-ICBS and alpha 2 beta 2 ICBS is unaffected by 2, 3 -bisphosphoglycerate while the oxygen affinity of alpha 2 ICBS beta 2 is decreased {{in the presence of}} this organic phosphate. The oxygen affinity of Hb-ICBS and alpha 2 ICBS beta 2 is independent of chloride concentration, while the alpha 2 beta 2 ICBS hybrid shows a reduced response to this anion. The tetramers alpha 2 ICBS beta 2 and alpha 2 ICBS beta 2 ICBS show a decreased alkaline Bohr effect, which can be rationalized as being due to disruption of the oxygen-linked chloride-binding sites; in the case of alpha 2 beta 2 ICBS the Bohr effect is instead (partially) maintained. The functional properties of artificial tetramers have been studied also from a kinetic point of view by CO combination and the results obtained compare satisfactorily with equilibrium data.

Although the Fe-His stretching frequency has been assigned for the deoxy form, the same has not been reported for any ligated forms of Hb. In the low frequency region RR spectra of oxyHb reported here, the H 2 O/D 2 O buffer exchange permitted the assignment of Fe-His stretching frequency to a band around 230 cm- 1. The Fe-O-O bending mode is also identified here in the low frequency region by isotopic substitution studies. Hemoglobin and its isolated subunits were reconstituted with meso and deuterohemes in order to study the effect of heme peripheral substituent modification on heme-protein interaction. Hybrid hemoglobins containing proto/meso and proto/deutero hemes were prepared in the met hybrid form {{as well as in}} the fully reduced form. The native and modified subunits of these hybrids in the deoxy form were selectively probed by using two different excitation lines.

Pyridoxal phosphate modified intracellular hemoglobin more slowly than pyridoxal. Pyridoxal phosphate lowered the oxygen affinity of normal cells, but had no effect on oxygen binding by sickle cells. Pyridoxal increased the oxygen affinity of normal and sickle erythrocytes equally. Pyridoxal phosphate significantly inhibited sickling of sickle or sickle trait erythrocytes (P less than 0. 001). Inhibition of sickling by pyridoxal phosphate was largely independent of oxygen binding; whereas inhibition of sickling by pyridoxal was almost entirely dependent on increased oxygen binding. Although pyridoxal phosphate and pyridoxal both inhibit sickling by modification of hemoglobin S, they differ in the kinetics of whole cell modification, the effect on oxygen affinity of intact cells, and the mechanism of action of the antisickling activity...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Tissue hypoxia after blood loss, replantation and flap reperfusion {{remains a}} {{challenging}} task in surgery. Normovolemic hemodilution improves he-morheologic properties without increasing oxygen car-rying capacity. Red blood cell transfusion is the cur-rent standard of treatment with its attendant risks. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the potential of the chemically <b>modified</b> <b>hemoglobin,</b> MP 4, to re-duce skin flap necrosis and its effect on selected blood markers and kidneys. Materials and Methods: Tissue ischemia was induced in the ear of hairless mice (n= 26). Hemodilution was performed by replacing one third of blood volume with the similar amount of MP 4, dextran, or blood. The extent of non-perfused tissue was assessed by in-travital fluorescent microscopy. Results: Of all groups, MP 4 showed the smallest area of no perfusion (in percentage of the ear ± SEM: 16. 3 % ± 2. 4), the control group the largest (22. 4 % ± 3. 5). Leukocytes showed a significant increase in the MP 4 and dextran group (from 8. 7 to 13. 6 respectively 15. 4 * 109 /l). On histology no changes of the kidneys could be observed. Conclusion: MP 4 causes an increase of leukocytes, im-proves the oxygen supply of the tissue and shows no evidence of renal impairment...|$|E
40|$|When cyanide {{poisoning}} {{is treated}} with a methemoglobin-forming agent, oxidative metabolism is protected {{at the expense of}} the oxygen capacity of the blood. The affinity of methemoglobin for CN- is high enough to compete with cytochrome oxidase, which protects the latter from becoming blocked, but all hemoglobin used for this purpose is lost for the transport of oxygen. Therefore, the fractions of the various hemoglobin derivatives present in the blood should be carefully monitored during this kind of treatment. After we had developed a multiwavelength spectrophotometric method for this purpose, we studied the feasibility of using a <b>modified</b> commercial six-wavelength <b>hemoglobin</b> photometer (Radiometer OSM 3) for easy and rapid analysis of methemoglobin and methemoglobin cyanide in small samples of blood. All conditions appeared to be fulfilled for the construction of a practical multiwavelength photometer for reliably monitoring methemoglobin therapy in patients with cyanide poisoning, even in the presence of carboxyhemoglobin, as often occurs in fire victims...|$|R
40|$|Hemoglobin (presumably its {{essential}} protein globin), given intraperitoneally to a protein-fasting dog, {{will be used}} effectively to supply the protein requirements of the body. Nitrogen balance may thus be maintained for 20 days under favorable conditions. New hemoglobin and plasma protein will be formed related to hemoglobin injections in depleted dogs where there is urgent need for these proteins (anemia and hypoproteinemia). Obviously this calls for supplementary amino acids which in globin are low and we assume these amino acids must be contributed from body protein stores. Plasma proteins (in plasma) tested {{in the same manner}} are completely utilized with no loss of nitrogen, positive nitrogen balance, weight balance, and no change in the albumin-globulin ratios. Hemoglobin (globin) is less effectively utilized as compared with plasma protein given parenterally and there is some increase in urinary nitrogen above control periods. The albumin-globulin ratio may be somewhat <b>modified</b> by <b>hemoglobin</b> injections intraperitoneally. Hemoglobin (globin) digests contribute effectively to body maintenance of nitrogen equilibrium. These digests are about as effective as whole hemoglobin in maintaining nitrogen balance but cause a rise in undetermined nitrogen not seen when hemoglobin alone is given intraperitoneally. Pigment radicles derived from hemoglobin given intraperitoneally are thrown away and appear as surplus bile pigment even when there is urgent need for all available nitrogenous material—given protein fasting, anemia, and hypoproteinemia in a bile fistula dog. The body evidently prefers to make rather than conserve the pyrrol aggregate (pigment radicle). We assume that the injected hemoglobin (globin) or hemoglobin digests contribute to the body protein pool and from this pool various proteins emerge to supply protein requirements of tissue or organ cells or to produce new hemoglobin or plasma protein if needed. We have no explanation as to what determines the pattern of this protein flow but new hemoglobin is very high on the priority list...|$|R
40|$|The present paper reports {{data for}} the effect of pH and D-glycerate 2, 3 -bisphosphate (D-glycerate- 2, 3 -P 2) on the oxygen {{equilibrium}} of normal and SH(beta 93) -modified human hemoglobin. At sufficiently high D-glycerate- 2, 3 -P 2 concentrations, both oxy and deoxy forms of HbA are saturated with the organic phosphate at all pH values between 6 and 9. Furthermore {{the difference in the}} affinity for D-glycerate- 2, 3 -P 2 between deoxy and oxy hemoglobin remains constant with pH, implying that the pK values of the Bohr effect groups in deoxy and oxyhemoglobin are not affected by the presence of D-glycerate- 2, 3 -P 2 on the hemoglobin molecule. In the <b>hemoglobins</b> <b>modified</b> in position beta 93, the difference in affinity between deoxy and oxy hemoglobin for D-glycerate- 2, 3 -P 2 decreases with decrease in pH due mainly to a decrease in the affinity of the deoxy form for D-glycerate- 2, 3 -P 2. The effect of the chemical modification appears to be primarily a change in pK of a Bohr group in deoxy hemoglobin which is especially pronounced in the presence of phosphates...|$|R
