50|$|While it {{is common}} to {{associate}} polyester resins and epoxy resins, their properties are sufficiently different that they are properly treated as distinct <b>materials.</b> <b>Polyester</b> resins are typically low strength unless used with a reinforcing material like glass fibre, are relatively brittle unless reinforced, and have low adhesion. Epoxies, by contrast, are inherently strong, somewhat flexible and have excellent adhesion. However, polyester resins are much cheaper.|$|R

40|$|Modification of {{textiles}} for achieving multifunctional materials {{is one of}} the guidance for future textile development in Europe. As highly hydrophobic synthetic <b>material,</b> <b>polyester</b> fabric from poly(ethylene-terphthalate) (PET), is not comfortable. Surface modifications such are aminolysis and alkaline hydrolysis result in better comfort and other fabric properties, but unfortunately, produce huge amounts of textile wastewater. Therefore, textile wet processes assisted by ultrasound and natural zeolite are researched. The main chemical effect of ultrasound is free radicals formation, which react with each other to form new molecules and radicals, or diffuse into surrounding and serve as oxidants. On the other hand, natural zeolites increase the active surface area, leading to better adsorption, and contribute to antimicrobial, UV, heat, flame and radioactive protection. In this paper, for better durability than achieved by thermosol procedure it was implemented on polyester fabric by high frequency ultrasound...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn general, the {{experience}} at inspection of motor road bridges and viaducts indicates the “water-proofing” system {{as one of}} the most vulnerable elements in a roadway structure. In many cases they are made with considerable deviations from specifications, violations of the engineering construction technology, etc. To manufacture a strong and durable roadway covering with a high wear resistance and resistance to the attack of corrosive media (water, salt, oil, etc.), the polymer concrete on the polyester, furfural acetone and epoxy, and the carbamide resin was studied. The most profitable material for the roadway pavement appears to be a polyester polymer concrete capable to harden at the subzero temperature and at the cost which is 2 - 3 times less than that of the epoxy <b>material.</b> <b>Polyester</b> polymer concrete <b>materials</b> possess the sufficient water resistance (Kb= 0. 7 - 0. 85) and frost resistance (300 - 500 cycles).

40|$|Liquid {{transporting}} {{and drying}} rate are two vital factors affecting the physiological comfort of sport garments. In this study, plated knitted fabrics produced with functional fiber yarns {{in the back}} of the knit (close to the body), combined with polypropylene or polyester in the face (outer surface) were tested in terms of their wicking behavior and drying rate capacity. Functional knitted fabrics were evaluated by vertical and horizontal wicking tests. The drying capability was assessed by drying rate tests under two different conditions, namely, at 20 ± 2 °C and 65 ± 3 % relative humidity and, in an oven, at 33 ± 2 °C, in order to simulate the human body temperature.
