6000|$|They {{all looked}} {{quickly in the}} same direction, and there, through a rent in the watery veil, they beheld a little spot of blue sky, rising into which was a mountain-top so pure, so faint so high and inexpressibly far off, yet so {{brilliant}} in a glow of sunshine, that {{it seemed as if}} heaven had been opened, and one of the hills of Paradise revealed. It was the first near view that the travellers had obtained of these <b>mountains</b> of <b>everlasting</b> ice. With the exception of the exclamations [...] "Wonderful!" [...] "Most glorious!" [...] they found no words for a time to express their feelings, and seemed glad to escape the necessity of doing so by listening to the remarks of their driver, as he went into an elaborate explanation of the name and locality of the particular part of Mont Blanc that had been thus disclosed.|$|R

[...] But as straws, chips, and seaweed play in a thousand fantastic figures {{on the face of the}} ocean, sometimes even concealing the solemn depths beneath, so the prose of daily existence mixes itself up with the solemn poetry of life, here as elsewhere.|$|R
60|$|NOW--soft awhile--have I arrived so {{near the}} end? Yes! {{it is all}} over now--a step or two over those new made graves, and the wearisome way is done. Can I {{accomplish}} my task? Can I streak my paper with words capacious of the grand conclusion? Arise, black Melancholy! quit thy Cimmerian solitude! Bring with thee murky fogs from hell, which may drink up the day; bring blight and pestiferous exhalations, which, entering the hollow caverns and breathing places of earth, may fill her stony veins with corruption, so that not only herbage may no longer flourish, the trees may rot, and the rivers run with gall--but the <b>everlasting</b> <b>mountains</b> be decomposed, and the mighty deep putrify, and the genial atmosphere which clips the globe, lose all powers of generation and sustenance.

6000|$|Let us {{look back}} on Florence while we may, and when its shining Dome is seen no more, go {{travelling}} through cheerful Tuscany, with a bright remembrance of it; for Italy will be the fairer for the recollection. The summer-time being come: and Genoa, and Milan, and the Lake of Como lying far behind us: and we resting at Faido, a Swiss village, near the awful rocks and <b>mountains,</b> the <b>everlasting</b> snows and roaring cataracts, of the Great Saint Gothard: hearing the Italian tongue {{for the last time}} on this journey: let us part from Italy, with all its miseries and wrongs, affectionately, in our admiration of the beauties, natural and artificial, of which it is full to overflowing, and in our tenderness towards a people, naturally well-disposed, and patient, and sweet-tempered. Years of neglect, oppression, and misrule, have been at work, to change their nature and reduce their spirit; miserable jealousies, fomented by petty Princes to whom union was destruction, and division strength, have been a canker at their root of nationality, and have barbarized their language; but the good that was in them ever, is in them yet, and a noble people may be, one day, raised up from these ashes. Let us entertain that hope! And let us not remember Italy the less regardfully, because, in every fragment of her fallen Temples, and every stone of her deserted palaces and prisons, she helps to inculcate the lesson that the wheel of Time is rolling for an end, and that the world is, in all great essentials, better, gentler, more forbearing, and more hopeful, as it rolls! ...|$|R
5000|$|Ehrenfeld {{states that}} the arrogance {{exhibited}} by today's society is attributed to humans’ over-dependence on technology to solve environmental and social problems. He concludes that the intelligence of humans can not simply solve everything and that until humans accept this fact, society will not truly progress. Ehrenfeld utilizes a pessimistic tone {{in the course of}} this book in regards to these [...] "arrogant" [...] assumptions made by modern society. He states that, [...] "We must live in our century and wait, enduring somehow the unavoidable sadness ... nothing is free of the taint of our arrogance. We have deﬁled everything, much of it forever, even the farthest jungles of the Amazon and the air above the <b>mountains,</b> even the <b>everlasting</b> sea which gave us birth." [...] Environmentalist David Orr accentuates the main points of this book when he states Ehrenfeld's belief that Americans lack the science of land health that Aldo Leopold described in the early twentieth century. This book is widely regarded as one of Ehrenfeld's most influential works.|$|R
60|$|I tarried there a while, {{filled with}} such {{thoughts}} as {{may not be}} written. Then, leaving my dead wife to her long sleep where the waters fall in melancholy music beneath {{the shadow of the}} <b>everlasting</b> <b>mountain,</b> I turned and sought that spot where first we had told our love. Now the orange grove was nothing but a tangled thicket; many of the trees were dead, choked with creepers, but some still flourished. There stood the one beneath which we had lingered, there was the rock that had been our seat, and there on the rock sat the wraith of Stella, the Stella whom I had wed! Ay! there she sat, and on her upturned face was that same spiritual look which I saw upon it in the hour when we first had kissed. The moonlight shone in her dark eyes, the breeze wavered in her curling hair, her breast rose and fell, a gentle smile played about her parted lips. I stood transfixed with awe and joy, gazing on that lost loveliness which once was mine. I could not speak, and she spoke no word; she did not even seem to see me. Now her eyes fell. For a moment they met mine, and their message entered into me.|$|R
6000|$|NINTH, A Creator is God! the God unto {{whom they}} that suffer {{according}} to his will are to commit the keeping of their souls--the Creator. And doth he take charge of them as a Creator? Then this should teach us to be far off from being dismayed, as the heathens are, at his tokens; for our God, the Lord, is the true God, the living God, the King of eternity (Jer 10:1,2,10). We should tremblingly glory and rejoice when we see him in the world, though upon those that are the most terrible of his dispensations. God the Creator will sometimes mount himself and ride through the earth in such majesty and glory, that he will make all to stand in the tent doors to behold him. O how he rode in his chariots of salvation when he went to save his people out of the land of Egypt! How he shook the nations! Then [...] "his glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power. Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet. He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the <b>everlasting</b> <b>mountains</b> were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting." [...] Then said the prophet, [...] "I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble. Was the Lord displeased against the rivers? was thine anger against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?" [...] (Hab 3:3-8).|$|R
6000|$|In the {{afternoon}} we rode {{out across the}} Rhone, where it breaks from the lake, and round upon the ascending shore. It is seldom here that the Alps are visible. The least mist hides them completely, so that travellers are wont to record it in their diaries as a great event, [...] "I saw Mont Blanc to-day." [...] Yesterday {{there was nothing but}} clouds and thick gloom; but now we had not ridden far before H. sprang suddenly, as if she had lost her senses--her cheeks flushed, and her eye flashing. I was frightened. [...] "There," [...] said she, pointing {{out of the side of}} the carriage across the lake, [...] "there he is--there's Mont Blanc." [...] "Pooh," [...] said I, [...] "no such thing." [...] And some trees for a moment intervened, and shut out the view. Presently the trees opened, and H. cried, [...] "There, that white; don't you see?--there--there!" [...] pointing with great energy, as if she were getting ready to fly. I looked and saw, sure enough, behind the dark mass of the Mole, (a huge blue-black mountain in the foreground,) the granite ranges rising gradually and grim as we rode; but, further still, behind those gray and ghastly barriers, all bathed and blazing in the sun's fresh splendors, undimmed by a cloud, unveiled even by a filmy fleece of vapor, and oh, so white--so intensely, blindingly white! against the dark-blue sky, the needles, the spires, the solemn pyramid, the transfiguration cone of Mont Blanc. Higher, and still higher, those apocalyptic splendors seemed lifting their spectral, spiritual forms, seeming to rise as we rose, seeming to start like giants hidden from behind the black brow of intervening ranges, opening wider the amphitheatre of glory, until, as we reached the highest point in our road, the whole unearthly vision stood revealed in sublime perspective. The language of the Revelation came rushing through my soul. This is, as it were, a door opened in heaven. Here are some of those <b>everlasting</b> <b>mountain</b> ranges, whose light is not of the sun, nor of the moon, but of the Lord God and of the Lamb. Here is, as it were, a great white throne, on which One might sit before whose face heaven and earth might flee; and here a sea of glass mingled with fire. Nay, rather, here are some faint shadows, some dim and veiled resemblances, which bring our earth-imprisoned spirits to conceive remotely what the disencumbered eye of the ecstatic apostle gazed upon.|$|R
60|$|But if, {{over and}} above this, any reader should be wroth at my having left Lancelot's history {{unfinished}} on questions in his opinion {{more important than that}} of love, let me entreat him to set manfully about finishing his own history--a far more important one to him than Lancelot's. If he shall complain that doubts are raised for which no solution is given, that my hero is brought into contradictory beliefs without present means of bringing them to accord, into passive acquiescence in vast truths without seeing any possibility of practically applying them--let him consider well whether such be not his own case; let him, if he be as most are, thank God when he finds out that such is his case, when he knows at last that those are most blind who say they see, when he becomes at last conscious how little he believes, how little he acts up to that small belief. Let him try to right somewhat of the doubt, confusion, custom-worship, inconsistency, idolatry, within him--some of the greed, bigotry, recklessness, respectably superstitious atheism around him; and perhaps before his new task is finished, Lancelot and Tregarva may have returned with a message, if not for him--for that depends upon him having ears to hear it--yet possibly for strong Lord Minchampstead, probably for good Lord Vieuxbois, and surely for the sinners and the slaves of Whitford Priors. What it will be, I know not altogether; but this I know, that if my heroes go on as they have set forth, looking with single mind for some one ground of human light and love, some everlasting rock whereon to build, utterly careless what the building may be, howsoever contrary to precedent and prejudice, and the idols of the day, provided God, and nature, and the accumulated lessons of all the ages, help them in its construction--then they will find in time the thing they seek, and see how the will of God may at last be done on earth, even as it is done in heaven. But, alas! between them and it are waste raging waters, foul mud banks, thick with dragons and sirens; and many a bitter day and blinding night, in cold and hunger, spiritual and perhaps physical, await them. For it was a true vision which John Bunyan saw, and one which, as the visions of wise men are wont to do, meant far more than the seer fancied, when he beheld in his dream that there was indeed a land of Beulah, and Arcadian Shepherd Paradise, on whose <b>mountain</b> tops the <b>everlasting</b> sunshine lay; but that the way to it, as these last three years are preaching to us, went past the mouth of Hell, and through the valley of the Shadow of Death.|$|R
