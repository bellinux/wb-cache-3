5|$|The {{majority}} of insects hatch from eggs. The fertilization and development takes place inside the egg, enclosed by a shell (chorion) {{that consists of}} maternal tissue. In contrast to eggs of other arthropods, most insect eggs are drought resistant. This is because inside the chorion two additional membranes develop from embryonic tissue, the amnion and the serosa. This serosa secretes a cuticle rich in chitin that protects the embryo against desiccation. In Schizophora however the serosa does not develop, but these flies lay their eggs in damp places, such as rotting matter. Some species of insects, like the cockroach Blaptica dubia, as well as juvenile aphids and tsetse flies, are ovoviviparous. The eggs of ovoviviparous animals develop entirely inside the female, and then hatch immediately upon being laid. Some other species, {{such as those in}} the genus of cockroaches known as Diploptera, are viviparous, and thus gestate inside the mother and are born alive. Some insects, like parasitic wasps, show polyembryony, where a single fertilized egg divides into many and in some cases thousands of separate embryos. Insects may be univoltine, bivoltine or <b>multivoltine,</b> i.e. they may have one, two or many broods (generations) in a year.|$|E

40|$|The {{protease}} {{activity in}} the midgut of bivoltine and muitivoltine races of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, was studied. The enzyme activity increased during fifth instar reached a peak, and decreased significantly through pre-pupal stage {{to the lowest level}} at the pupal stagTouring pharate adult period, the protease activity increased to reach another peak just before emergence of the moth, and decreased thereafter. The enzyme activity m bivoltmes was about 2 - 3 times higher than <b>multivoltines</b> at the peak levels. Bivoltines showed a sex difference in midgut protease activity while no significant difference was observed in <b>multivoltines.</b> Larvae and pharate adults showed a difference in the pH optima for the enzyme activity.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{understand}} the genetic polymorphism and phylogenetic relationships among the eighteen silkworm races/breeds comprising six each of bivoltines(BVs), <b>multivoltines</b> (MVs) and autosomal mutants of the silkworm Bombyx mori belonging to both indigenous and exotic origins, which were drawn from the germplasm of the Department. The DNA was extracted from the whole moth and amplification was carried out with inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) marker technique. Four ISSR primers namelyUBC- 812, UBC- 813, UBC- 826 and UBC- 827 were utilized of which two primers UBC- 812 and UBC- 826 generated a total of 88 clear, distinct and reproducible bands ranging from 500 bp to 2000 bp corresponding to an average of 44 bands/primer. Among 88 bands 18 bands were monomorphic and remaining 70 were polymorphic. Thus, the percentage of polymorphism revealed for UBC- 812 primer was 100 %, whereas UBC- 826 revealed 60. 86 % indicating the occurrence of genomic variation from the inbred population. The unweight pair group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA) was constructed from the ISSR marker profiles have clearly discriminated the BVs, whereas MVs and an auto somalmutant namely pre and a BV race namely C 108 were genetically inter-linked together incluster-I and II respectively.

40|$|The Indian {{sericulture}} {{industry is}} beset with many problems. One {{of the main}} problems is the inability to produce quality silk of international grade. The quality silk can be produced only form bivoltines. The bulk of silk produced in India is from <b>Multivoltines</b> which are of inferior quality. Therefore, it is highly pertinent to have more productive bivoltine silkworm breeds capable of producing quality silk. However, the hot climatic conditions of India is not conducive to rear productive bivoltines. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop bivoltine breeds which can yield stable crops under the adverse climatic conditions. Accordingly, efforts should be focussed by the silkworm breeders to develop bivoltine breeds with genetic plasticity to buffer against the adverse climatic conditions. The main constraint of the tropical environment is the high temperature coupled with high and low humidity. It is a well established fact that the bivoltines are highly vulnerable to high temperature coupled with high and low humidity especially in the late instars.

40|$|Induction of {{resistance}} is a mechanism which is operative in nature {{by the nature}} itself. It is vaccination protocol, which involves exposing the susceptible host to the pathogen at low, insufficient dose to cause disease or by using abiotic and biotic components which is generalized by the term inducers. To induce resistance in silkworm against nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV), two sets of experiments were carried out. For both the experiments five silkworm races i. e., NB 4 D 2, CSR 2 (Bivoltines), Pure Mysore, C. nichi (<b>Multivoltines)</b> and a hybrid (PM X CSR 2) were used. In {{the first set of}} experiments silkworms were fed with known amount of inactivated nuclear polyhedral inclusion bodies (PIBs) thrice at various time intervals for multiple immunization. In the second set of experiments such a type of treatment was given only once. At the age of fifth instar second day, the silkworms of all the batches i. e., control, single immunized and multiple immunized batches were challenge inoculated with known amount of live PIBs. Among immunization methods, the multiple immunization method was more effective when compared to single immunization method, as all the races indicated by showing high survival rate. Also variation in qualitative and quantitative biochemical composition was observed with respect to haemolymph proteins and enzymes such as amylase, succinate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase and beta esterase when compared with the unimmunized controls. The results pave light towards use of immunization method to induce resistance in silkworms against the dreaded NPV. The technique can be further extended to other diseases also...|$|R
40|$|Silkworm, being a poikilothermic insect, {{its growth}} and {{development}} is affected by environmental factors especially, temperature. In tropical countries like India, it has considerable effect on silk production due to the prevailing of hot climatic conditions. Previous attempts to evolve silkworm breeds and hybrids tolerant to high temperature by traditional breeding methods have not yielded the desired results. Hence application of new strategies like marker assisted selection (MAS) {{could be the most}} effective strategy for developing a thermo-tolerant bivoltine silkworm for sustainable silk production in India. As a prelude, in this study it is aimed to identify simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers closely linked with thermotolerance in silkworm. To do so, 20 silkworm breeds were evaluated at high temperature (36 °C) and based on pupation percentage, two <b>multivoltines</b> (Nistari and Cambodge) and two bivoltines (SK 4 C and BHR 3) were identified as thermo-tolerant and one bivoltine (CSR 2) was identified as the susceptible breed. These breeds were screened with 85 SSR markers drawn from different linkage groups and out of those, only 11 markers (12. 9 %) showed distinct polymorphism between thermo-tolerant and susceptible breeds. Further, bulked segregant analysis (BSA) was performed using 11 polymorphic SSR primers, by comparing the SSR profiles of the tolerant (Nistari) and susceptible (CSR 2) parents, their F 1 and F 2 bulks. Nevertheless, only 5 markers generated clear differences in the amplified DNAs between the bulks corresponding to that of the parents suggesting that the DNA regions amplified by these SSR markers are closely linked to thermotolerance in B. mori. The results obtained through bulk segregant analysis was further confirmed by genotyping 5 linked SSR markers using 140 individual F 2 progenies. Of these 5 markers, highest Spearman's rho correlation coefficient was shown by S 0816 indicating a high degree of closeness between the genotypic and phenotype variations in F 2 population. Furthermore, we have also attempted to locate the genes near to S 0816 by in silico approach and upshot revealed 3 genes nearer to its sequence on the B. mori genome. The BGIBMGA 005249 gene was found to be located nearest to S 0816 at a distance of 14. 8 Kb. But, further studies are required in this regard to derive a relationship between the thermotolerance and the functional role of identified genes nearer to the closest marker, so that the identified markers can be used to develop a thermo-tolerant silkworm breed through MAS...|$|R
2500|$|Some saturniids are {{strictly}} univoltine, producing only one generation a year, whereas others are <b>multivoltine,</b> producing {{more than one}} brood a year. Spring and summer broods hatch {{in a matter of}} weeks; autumn broods enter a state known as diapause and emerge the following spring. How the pupae know when to hatch early or hibernate is not yet fully understood, though research suggests day length during the larval fifth instar plays a major role, as well as cooling temperatures. Longer days may prompt pupae to develop early, while shorter days result in pupal diapause. The number of broods is flexible, and a single female may produce both fast-developing and slow-developing individuals, or they may produce different numbers of broods in different years or parts of the range. In some species [...] e.g. the luna moth (Actias luna) or Callosamia securifera (both [...] Saturniinae) , spring and summer broods look different, with different genes activated by environmental conditions.|$|E

50|$|Anopheles walkeri has a <b>multivoltine</b> life cycle. It {{produces}} a hardy winter egg which differs morphologically {{from the more}} vulnerable summer eggs by having enlarged floats on the dorsal side. By overwintering in egg form, this species is able to mature through one full larval generation before hibernating adults of other species are able to become active. The <b>multivoltine</b> life cycle means this species is active during both the swampy, open water conditions of early spring, as well as {{later in the year}} after the swampland has become thickened with plant growth. It takes about 10 days to mature through the larval stages and pupate, dependent on temperature and water conditions. Adults will typically mate within a few hours of emergence from their pupated form. The females then begin to seek out a blood meal to provide necessary protein to facilitate egg development. The female will then rest while the eggs develop. Once mature, the eggs are oviposited and the female begins the process all over again, feeding and laying for the 40 days or so that it lives for.|$|E
