5|$|Massey and Brown {{introduced}} standardization to the fragmented company. After visiting Pete Harman's {{operations in}} Utah, {{they began to}} implement the stand-alone take-out model across the entire chain. Franchisees were ordered to delist their own menu items {{so that they could}} concentrate on KFC products. The restaurants were re-branded with a distinctive red-and-white striped color pattern and mansard roofs with cupolas. The roll-out of freestanding stores accelerated the company's growth as outlets exclusively selling fried chicken proved to be <b>more</b> <b>appealing</b> to potential franchisees.|$|E
5|$|Sakura {{has become}} the series' female lead, although, she was not {{immediately}} intended for the role. Kishimoto has had difficulty drawing her character resulting in Kishimoto inadvertently emphasizing certain parts of her appearance, including her large forehead. In {{order to make the}} character <b>more</b> <b>appealing</b> {{in the second part of}} the series, Kishimoto designed her costume to make her look more like a martial artist as well as more beautiful during later chapters. Chie Nakamura voices the character in the animated adaptations of the series, while Kate Higgins plays her in the English dub.|$|E
5|$|The film is {{inspired}} by Aesop's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. Production began shortly {{after the release of}} Toy Story in 1995. The screenplay was penned by Stanton and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw. The ants in the film were redesigned to be <b>more</b> <b>appealing,</b> and Pixar's animation unit employed new technical innovations in computer animation. During production, the filmmakers became embroiled in a public feud with DreamWorks Animation due to the production of their similar film Antz, which was released the same year. Randy Newman composed the music for the film.|$|E

5|$|The {{reconstruction}} of NY205 transformed the road {{into the main}} north–south connection between West Oneonta and Oaksville. At the same time, the parallel Southern New York Railroad had become unprofitable as the highways running alongside the track had become <b>more</b> <b>appealing</b> to shippers and travelers than the railroad itself. In 1940, the railroad abandoned the section of its line between West Oneonta and Jordanville, Herkimer County. The track ran alongside state routes {{for most of its}} length, and the presence of NY205 and NY167 was noted as a contributing factor to the line's demise in the railroad's abandonment petition to the Interstate Commerce Commission.|$|E
5|$|The series won several {{international}} advertising {{awards for}} BBH. The brand's creaminess was emphasised through {{items such as}} face cream, ice cream, sun cream and whipped cream. Managing director of Whitbread, Miles Templeman, explained that: We were thinking how to turn a second-rate north-west brand into something more stylish, to make it <b>more</b> <b>appealing</b> again. BBH thought of focusing on the creamy aspect, of selling a beer like a face cream.

It also altered the traits of the male leads to make them <b>more</b> <b>appealing</b> to contemporary viewers. Elinor and Marianne's different characteristics were emphasised through imagery and invented scenes. Ang Lee was selected as director, both due to {{his work in the}} 1993 film The Wedding Banquet and because Doran believed he would help the film appeal to a wider audience. Lee was given a budget of $16 million.|$|E

5|$|As {{the first}} shooter {{game in the}} Final Fantasy series, the game's staff had various {{problems}} during development, although producer Yoshinori Kitase found the experience challenging, and added role-playing elements {{in order to make}} the game more entertaining for traditional fans of the main series. When Dirge of Cerberus was released outside Japan, several aspects of the gameplay were modified in order to make it <b>more</b> <b>appealing.</b> A mobile phone tie-in was also released in 2006, while in 2008, Square republished the game in Japan with the updates made for the Western versions. Although the game has sold 1.5 million copies worldwide as of 2011, it has received a mixed critical reaction.|$|E
5|$|Bardou-Jacquet {{wanted to}} compose the {{advertisement}} {{with as little}} computer-generated imagery as possible, believing that the final product would be that much <b>more</b> <b>appealing</b> to its audience. To this end, he set two months aside {{for the creation of}} hundreds of conceptual drawings detailing various possible interactions between the parts, and a further four months for practical testing and development. For the testing phase, the script was broken into small segments, each comprising only one or two interactions. Ideas deemed unworkable by the testing crew, such as airbag explosions and collisions between front and rear sections of the car, were abandoned, and the remaining segments were slowly brought together until the full and final sequence was developed.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{of the set}} {{began on}} December 5, 1994, on Paramount Stage 16. The set's {{construction}} pushed the episode's cost over its budget. This was considered normal for a new series and the next four episodes also exceeded their budgets. Despite {{the high cost of}} the manor set, the crew designed it for repeated use {{over the course of the}} series. This was <b>more</b> <b>appealing</b> than shooting several sequences of a covered wagon on location in the countryside. Curry took special care to merge the blue-screen effects with Kolbe's footage seamlessly to achieve the effect of the manor transforming back into the holodeck. Curry and Kolbe had worked together on previous projects that required similar special effects.|$|E
5|$|Holy Roman {{emperors}} {{had been}} elected from the House of Habsburg {{for most of the}} previous three centuries. Charles VI arranged a marriage of his eldest daughter, Maria Theresa, to Francis of Lorraine. Francis relinquished the Duchy of Lorraine near France in exchange for the Grand Duchy of Tuscany near Austria to make himself a <b>more</b> <b>appealing</b> candidate for eventual election as emperor. On paper, many heads of state and, most importantly, the rulers of the German states of the Holy Roman Empire, accepted the Pragmatic Sanction and the idea of Francis as the next emperor. Two key exceptions, the duchies of Bavaria and Saxony, held important electoral votes and could impede or even block Francis's election. When Charles died in 1740, Maria Theresa had to fight for her family's entitlements in Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia, and her husband faced competition in his election as the Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, Harrison {{began to}} lobby Congress to repeal Article Six of the Northwest Ordinance, which {{prohibited}} {{slavery in the}} original Northwest Territory, in order permit slavery in the Indiana Territory. He claimed legalizing slavery was necessary to make the region <b>more</b> <b>appealing</b> to settlers and ultimately make the territory economically viable. That same year Harrison had indenturing legalized by the General Court. The territory was granted representation in the United States Congress in 1805, and pro-slavery Benjamin Parke became the territory's first representative. Parke used his position to get Congress to support Harrison's appeal. He was able pass legislation to have Article Six suspended for ten years, and the territories covered by the ordinance were granted the ability to legalize slavery. By the same act, Congress removed the General Court's legislative power and created a legislative council to be elected by popular vote.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{consistently}} highlighted its comedic achievement. Game Informer said it {{is frequently}} hilarious, ranking it among the best comedic games ever released. IGN praised The Stick of Truth for its witty and intelligent satire of the role-playing genre, while others said {{that as well as}} being consistently funny, the game was suitably boisterous, shocking, provocative, self-effacing, and fearless in its desire to offend. Many reviewers agreed that much of the content was <b>more</b> <b>appealing</b> to South Park fans; some jokes are lost on the uninitiated but others said that enough context was provided for most jokes to be funny regardless of players' familiarity with the source material. IGN said that it is the game South Park fans have always wanted, but some reviewers said that without the South Park license, the game's shallowness would be more obvious.|$|E
5|$|The Fast5 Series is a {{competition}} {{among the top}} six national netball teams, as ranked by the INF World Rankings. It is organised by the INF {{in conjunction with the}} national governing bodies of the six competing nations, UK Sport, and the host city's local council. The All England Netball Association covers air travel, accommodation, food and local travel expenses for all teams, while the respective netball governing bodies cover player allowances. It is held over three days, with each team playing each other once during the first two days in a round-robin format. The four highest-scoring teams advance to the semi-finals; the winners face each other in the Grand Final. The competition features modified fastnet rules and has been likened to Twenty20 cricket and rugby sevens. A new format featuring shorter matches with modified rules was designed to make the game <b>more</b> <b>appealing</b> to spectators and television audiences. The World Netball Series was held annually in England from 2009 to 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{final weeks}} were a frantic rush to finish, {{with the band}} and {{production}} crew all suffering from exhaustion. Eno and Flood had minimal involvement with the final mixes, as they had other commitments. Facing understaffing, in late December, U2 hired Steve Lillywhite, producer of their first three albums, to remix the potential singles and make them <b>more</b> <b>appealing</b> to commercial radio. His eleventh-hour presence and changes caused discontent among the production crew, including Eno and Lanois. Lillywhite mixed four songs with engineer Mark Wallis on an SSL desk at Windmill Lane Studios. At the same time, Lanois, McCarthy, and Meegan mixed seven songs at Melbeach on a 24-track AMEK 2500 mixing desk; all three were required to operate the console {{due to the lack}} of mix automation.|$|E
50|$|A garnish makes food {{or drink}} items <b>more</b> {{visually}} <b>appealing.</b> They may, for example, enhance their color, {{such as when}} paprika is sprinkled on a salmon salad. They may provide a color contrast, for example when chives are sprinkled on potatoes. They may make a cocktail <b>more</b> visually <b>appealing,</b> such as when a cocktail umbrella is added to an exotic drink, or when a Mai Tai is topped with any number of tropical fruit pieces. Sushi may be garnished with baran, a type of plastic grass or leaf. Sometimes a garnish and a condiment will be used together to finish the presentation of a dish; for example, an entrée could be topped with a sauce, as the condiment, along with a sprig of parsley as a garnish.|$|R
