25|$|Almost {{every country}} in the world has laws {{relating}} to and aimed at preventing child labour. International Labour Organisation has helped set international law, which most countries have signed on and ratified. According to ILO <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> <b>convention</b> (C138) of 1973, child labour refers to any work performed by children under the age of 12, non-light work done by children aged 12–14, and hazardous work done by children aged 15–17. Light work was defined, under this Convention, as any work that does not harm a child's health and development, and that does not interfere with his or her attendance at school. This convention has been ratified by 135 countries.|$|E

This Convention regards violence against women as a form of discrimination and calls on participating governments to put measures in place to combat violence in all forms, be it domestic or public. The UAE regularly participates in and hosts international and GCC conferences on women's issues. The UAE has signed several other international treaties on protecting the rights of women. Among these are the Convention on the Rights of a Child, the Hours of Work (Industry) Convention, the Equal Remuneration Convention, the Conventions Concerning Employment of Women During the Night and the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Age</b> <b>Convention.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1999, ILO {{helped lead}} the Worst Forms Convention 182 (C182), which {{has so far been}} signed upon and {{domestically}} ratified by 151 countries including the United States. This international law prohibits worst forms of child labour, defined as all forms of slavery and slavery-like practices, such as child trafficking, debt bondage, and forced labour, including forced recruitment of children into armed conflict. The law also prohibits the use of a child for prostitution or the production of pornography, child labour in illicit activities such as drug production and trafficking; and in hazardous work. Both the Worst Forms Convention (C182) and the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Age</b> <b>Convention</b> (C138) are examples of international labour standards implemented through the ILO that deal with child labour.|$|E

Some of Haiti's efforts to combat modern day slavery include ratifying several key conventions, including the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UHDR), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, and the ILO <b>Minimum</b> <b>Age</b> <b>Convention.</b> [...] In 2014 Haiti ratified the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children. Conventions such as these, if enforced, could help to combat human trafficking.

30|$|Age {{may account}} for little of the {{variation}} in paid employment, but there is still scope for <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> of employment regulation to influence time allocation. To examine this, we look for changes in time allocation at the <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> of employment in each of the 59 countries separately and pooled. Our econometric approach is to compare the observed prevalence of paid employment at the <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> of employment to what would be predicted based on an age trend estimated on the regulated (younger) ages. Our estimates of the impact of <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> regulation are, in effect, estimates of the impact on paid employment of extending current <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> regulations by one additional year, holding all prices fixed. Of course, this design does not inform the counterfactual of what employment would be in the absence of <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> laws altogether.|$|R

5000|$|According to the ILO, {{child labor}} is “work that deprives {{children}} of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development.” The ILO classifies work conducted by children into three categories: children in employment, child labor, and hazardous work. The ILO condemns both child labor and hazardous work {{with the goal of}} eliminating hazardous child labor by 2016. In 2012, the ILO estimated that 168 million children (11% of the world’s children) were engaged in child labour, of which, 85 million engaged in hazardous work. [...] ILO Convention No. 5 adopted in 1919 and entered into force in 1921 was the first ILO convention regulating child labour. Specifically, the main provision of the article stated “children under the age of fourteen years shall not be employed or work in any public or private industrial undertaking.” Since its inception in 1919, several other ILO conventions had been adopted that have modified and expanded the initial 1919 convention. Today, the C138 <b>Minimum</b> <b>Age</b> <b>Convention,</b> 1973 and C182 Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention 1999 have replaced all the previous conventions. The <b>Minimum</b> <b>Age</b> <b>Convention</b> defines the minimum age children are allowed to work. Children, unless under special allowances, are not allowed to engage in hazardous work until the age of 18. The basic minimum age for child labor is 15 (14 for developing countries), and the minimum wage for light work, which may not interfere with education or vocational orientation and training, is 13 (12 for developing countries). [...] C182 urges all governments to take immediate action to identify and eliminate the worst forms of child labour.The following are defined as hazardous work according to the ILO: ...|$|E
30|$|According to this theory, {{the data}} will be {{consistent}} with binding <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> of employment regulation when we observe increases in paid employment, decreases in work inside the household, and no change in schooling or idleness at the <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> of employment. In the data, we observe increases in paid employment at the <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> only in 4 of the 59 countries. We do not observe a significant or substantive decline in work inside the family at the <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> {{in any of the}} countries. Hence, we do not observe evidence consistent with binding <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> of employment regulation in a single country. The data are consistent with increases in household based activities when paid employment increases in general. Some countries have labor laws that allow light work before the <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> of employment, and there is one country, Trinidad and Tobago, where the data are consistent with binding light work regulations.|$|R

50|$|The labour {{department}} {{estimates that}} there were about one million of South Africa's children who are working as child labourers. South Africa has ratified the ILO <b>Minimum</b> <b>Age</b> <b>Convention,</b> 1973 (C138). This Convention requires ratifying states to pursue a national policy designed to ensure the effective abolition of child labour and to progressively raise the minimum age for admission to employment or work. South Africa also assisted in drafting the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (C182), which it ratified in 2000. In terms of this convention South Africa must take time-bound measures to eliminate the worst forms of child labour (WFCL). These include forms of bonded labour, commercial sexual exploitation of children, trafficking of children, {{and the use of}} children by others in illegal activities, including drug trafficking.|$|E
50|$|Paraguay’s formal {{labour force}} was {{estimated}} to total about 2.7 million workers in 2004. About 45 percent worked in the agricultural sector, 31 percent in the industrial sector, and 19 percent in the services sector. Unemployment was estimated at about 15 percent. Paraguay’s constitution guarantees the right of workers to unionize and bargain collectively. About 15 percent of workers are members of one of Paraguay’s 1,600 unions. Strikes are legal and not uncommon. The 2001 census found that 5 percent of Paraguay’s workforce was {{under the age of}} 14. Although Paraguay ratified the International Labour Organization’s <b>Minimum</b> <b>Age</b> <b>Convention</b> in 2004, child labour continues to be prevalent. Nearly 14 percent of {{children between the ages of}} 5 and 17 are employed, many in poor conditions and for negligible pay.

[...] The ILO also has three categories pertaining to children in work: economically active children, child labour, and hazardous work. Children can be categorised as economically active if they are involved in work outside of school or the home at least one hour once every seven days. Children can be categorised as performing child labour if they are under the age of 12 or performing hazardous work. Children are categorised as performing hazardous work if they are involved in activities that may harm their physical, mental, or developmental health or safety.|$|E
