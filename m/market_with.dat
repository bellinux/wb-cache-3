40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} R&D {{persistence}} of R&D active firms in different <b>markets</b> <b>with</b> different intensities of competition, based on firm-level panel {{data for the}} period 1996 - 2008.

Persistence of R&D expenditures {{is more likely to be}} observed in <b>markets</b> <b>with</b> few principal competitors (between 6 and 10) and is very unlikely to be observed in polypolistic type of markets (more than 50 competitors). These results call for a stronger coordination between competition policy and innovation promotion policy, since the former basically aims at larger <b>markets</b> <b>with</b> many competitors, while the latter aims at persistence of R&D efforts and thus <b>markets</b> <b>with</b> fewer competitors.
