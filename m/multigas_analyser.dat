40|$|Recently {{reducing}} {{emissions of}} the harmful gases that {{generated in the}} combustion process of the automobile and other internal combustion engine is absolutely essential to environmental preservation. These emissions pollute the environment {{and contribute to the}} global warming, acid rain, smog, odours, and respiratory and other health problems. Therefore many countries around the world are taking major efforts to toughen emission standards. Motor cycles, the lagers amount, contributed the major air pollution in Indonesia. The hamful gases that generated in the motor cycles especially CO, HC and NOx. As the motor cycles is getting older, many components in the combustion system are getting worst and contribute more hamfull emissions. This research was done on July 2001 to find out the emissions and was done on Honda Astrea Grand which have been used since 1995, 1996 dan 1997 on the variety of gear level. A <b>multigas</b> <b>analyser</b> was used to analyse the emission gas out form the tile pipe. Â The result shows that the maximum CO and HC emission are generated by all motor cycle on the first gear. The higerst CO and HC emission is generated by the olderst motor cycle (1995) and the minimum CO and HC emission is generated by the motor cycle that has been used since 1997...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Measurement of {{the carbon}} {{monoxide}} transfer factor (TLCO) has traditionally been performed using the single breath method but recently the intrabreath method has been developed. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the two methods in the clinical evaluation of patients with obstructive and non-obstructive pulmonary disorders. METHODS [...] Measurements of TLCO with the intrabreath method were carried out on a study sample composed of 50 patients with non-obstructive disorders and 50 with airways obstruction (FEV 1 /FVC < 70 %) either before or after a single breath measurement of the TLCO had been performed. The method involves the continuous analysis of a single slow expirate using a computerised rapid <b>multigas</b> infrared <b>analyser.</b> TLCO, alveolar volume (VA), TLCO/VA, and inspired vital capacity (IVC) values were obtained for both groups by both methods. RESULTS [...] When measured with the intrabreath method the group with airways obstruction showed lower TLCO and TLCO/VA values than the non-obstructive group. VA was higher in both patient groups when measured with the intrabreath technique. The same test also showed higher TLCO values with the intrabreath method in the group with non-obstructive disorders and lower TLCO/VA values with the intrabreath method in those with airways obstruction. The corresponding parameters obtained by the two methods correlated closely, with no correlation between the magnitude of the differences with the magnitude of the readings. An index of gas mixing indicated a better distribution of the inspired air for the intrabreath method than for the single breath method. The VA values obtained with the intrabreath method showed a closer agreement to the actual total lung capacities measured by body plethysmography. CONCLUSION [...] The intrabreath method of determining TLCO is comparable to the traditional single breath method. Measurement of alveolar volume by the intrabreath method approximates more closely to total lung capacity, even in subjects with airways obstruction...|$|R
