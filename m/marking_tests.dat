A {{wide range of}} different Data Matrix symbol marking processes and materials, including some still under development, were evaluated. The samples flown on MISSE 1 and 2 were in orbit for 3 years and 348 days, MISSE 3 and 4 were in orbit for 1 year and 15 days, MISSE 6 was in orbit for 1 year and 130 days, and MISSE 8 was in orbit for 2 years and 55 days. The initial MISSE <b>marking</b> <b>tests</b> clearly reflected that intrusive marking processes can be successfully used for this purpose. All of the intrusive marking processes tested exceeded program expectations and met 100 percent of the principle investigators objectives. However, subsequent tests demonstrated that some additive marking processes will also satisfy the requirements. This was an unexpected result...|$|E

40|$|Some {{animals are}} capable of {{recognizing}} themselves in a mirror, which {{is considered to be}} demonstrated by passing the <b>mark</b> <b>test.</b> Mirror self-recognition capacity has been found in just a few mammals having very large brains and only in one bird, the magpie (Pica pica). The results obtained in magpies have enormous biological and cognitive implications because the fact that magpies were able to pass the <b>mark</b> <b>test</b> meant that this species is at the same cognitive level with great apes, that mirror self-recognition has evolved independently in the magpie and great apes (which diverged 300 million years ago), and that the neocortex (which is not present in the bird’s brains) is not a prerequisite for mirror self-recognition as previously believed. Here, we have replicated the experimental design used on magpies to determine whether jackdaws (Corvus monedula) are also capable of mirror self-recognition by passing the <b>mark</b> <b>test.</b> We found that our nine jackdaws showed a very high interest towards the mirror and exhibited self-contingent behavior as soon as mirrors were introduced. However, jackdaws were not able to pass the mark test: both sticker-directed actions and sticker removal were performed with a similar frequency in both the cardboard (control) and the mirror conditions. We conclude that our jackdaws’ behaviour raises non-trivial questions about the methodology used in the avian <b>mark</b> <b>test.</b> Our study suggests that the use of self-adhesive stickers on sensitive throat feathers may open the way to artefactual results because birds might perceiv...|$|R

Eighteen-month-olds, however, no longer showed this relation.

40|$|The {{reactions}} of chimpanzees to regular mirrors {{and the results}} of the standard Gallup <b>mark</b> <b>test</b> have been well documented. In addition to using the <b>mark</b> <b>test</b> to demonstrate self-recognition in a regular mirror, we exposed six female chimpanzees to mirrors that produced distorted or multiplied self-images. Their reactions to their self-images, in terms of mirror-guided self-referenced behaviors, indicated that correct assessment of the source of the mirror image was made by each subject in each of the mirrors. Recognition of a distorted self-image implies an ability for abstraction in the subjects in that the distortion must be rationalized before self-recognition occurs. The implications of these results in terms of illuminating the relative importance of feature and contingency of movement cues to self-recognition are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} {{self-awareness}} and mirror self-recognition {{has been more}} discussed since 1970, when the new procedure named <b>mark</b> <b>test</b> showed the self-recognition in chimpanzees. Although the theory that mirror self-recognition provides evidence of self-awareness is generally accepted, it was showed in the recent studies {{that it is not}} necessarily always true, and that the transition between "having self-awareness" and "not having self-awareness" is gradual. There are more mirror tests dealing with mirror self-recognition in animals, such as mirror-mediated spatial location task. Almost all tested species passed well this kind of mirror tests and showed that there was a certain degree of mirror-image understanding. However not all of them show mirror induced self-recognition. There are several reasons of negative results of <b>mark</b> <b>test</b> such as improper methods and procedures applied to particular species, as well as individual differences, e. g. in social isolation and previous experience with mirror. Problems appear in comparative testing of species with different body morphology, e. g. cetaceans, birds, and fish which have forelimbs in form of wings and fins. They are not able to show the same behavioral responses as primates, for which the original <b>mark</b> <b>test</b> was developed. Applied methods should be always [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} laser marking process of {{titanium}} cold sprayed coatings on aluminium substrates. Despite several studies regarding the laser marking process are available in literature very few attention have been paid to the marking of cold sprayed coatings and there are no previous papers in literature. Also the phenomena occurring during the marking of a porous coating are to date not fully understood and will be discussed in this paper. The experimental campaign was also repeated on grade 2 titanium rolled sheets with a thickness of 2 mm. The <b>marking</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out under different experimental conditions varying the main process parameters (i. e. laser pulse power and laser scan speed), after that the mark sections were observed by optical microscope and SEM. Both the maximum penetration depth and width of the marks were acquired and also internal damages induced by the process were studied. A correlation between the process parameters and the mark's geometry was found. The results show the effectiveness of the laser process to produce high quality marks on both the titanium layer and the titanium sheet. Moreover, a higher mark penetration on Ti coating was observed compared to the Ti sheet. However, the results show also the possibility to introduce severe and hidden damages in both materials if the process parameters are not properly set...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the {{aerospace}} industry, {{in order to}} ensure the identification and the traceability of the products, high repeatability, non-invasive and durable marking processes are required. Laser marking {{is one of the most}} advanced marking technologies. Compared to traditional marking processes, like punches, microdot, scribing or electric discharge pencil etcher, laser marking offers several advantages, such us: non-contact working, high repeatability, high scanning speed, mark width comparable to the laser spot dimension, high flexibility and high automation of the process itself. In order to assure the mark visibility for the component lifetime, an appropriate depth of the mark is required. In this way, a stable behaviour is ensured also when the component operates in aggressive environments (i. e. in presence of oxidation, corrosion and wear phenomena). The mark depth is strongly affected by the laser source kind and by the process parameters, such us average power, pulse frequency and scanning speed. Moreover, an excessive mark penetration could cause stress concentrations and reduce the fatigue life of the component. Consequently, an appropriate selection of the process parameters is required in order to assure visibility and to avoid excessive damage. Cold Spray Deposition (CSD) is a relative new technology that allows to produce surface coatings without significant substrate temperature increasing. In aeronautics fields this technology is useful to coat materials sensible to temperature, such as solution tempered aluminum alloy, with a titanium layer. Aim of the work is to characterize the laser marking process on CSD Ti coating, in order to study the influence of the laser marking process parameters (pulse power and scanning speed), on the groove geometry of the marking. The experimental <b>marking</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out through a 30 W MOPA Q-Switched Yb:YAG fibre laser; under different process conditions. The groove geometry was measured through a HIROX HK 9700 optical microscope. The results showed the effectiveness of the laser process to produce high quality marks on the titanium layer. Moreover, a correlation between the process parameters and the mark's geometry was clearly observed...|$|E

However, in mathematics the process of determining the component score is slightly more complex because in mathematics there is a school mark to consider in addition to the <b>test</b> <b>mark.</b> To include the school mark the next step of the process is to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the scaled mathematics <b>test</b> <b>marks</b> for each school. Then, school at a time, the mathematics school marks for each student are moderated (or scaled) to the same mean and standard deviation as the scaled <b>test</b> <b>marks</b> for students for that school. The scores formed from this process are called the moderated school marks and are also out of 100. The reason for scaling the school <b>marks</b> and <b>test</b> <b>marks</b> to the same mean and standard deviation is to ensure that both school and <b>test</b> <b>marks</b> have the same value in the final component score. Next, the scaled <b>test</b> <b>marks</b> and moderated school marks for each student are averaged and then re-scaled on a statewide basis to the mean of 60 and standard deviation of 12 to form the final component score out of 100. The reason for scaling all component scores to the same mean and standard deviation is to ensure that each component is given an equal value in the profile score. If this were not to occur then the component with the highest standard deviation would have the greatest value.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{study of}} self-recognition, with {{a mirror and}} a mark applied to the face, was conducted independently by Gallup (1970) for use with chimpanzees and monkeys, and by Amsterdam (1972) for use with infant humans. Comparative psychologists have followed the model (and assumptions) set by Gallup, whereas developmental psychologists have followed a different model (e. g., Lewis & Brooks-Gunn, 1979). This article explores the assumptions in the definitions and methods of self-recognition assessments in the 30 years since these initial studies, and charts the divergence between the developmental <b>mark</b> <b>test</b> and the comparative <b>mark</b> <b>test.</b> Two new studies, 1 with infant chimpanzees and 1 with infant humans, illustrate a reconciliation of the 2 approaches. Overt application of the mark, or other procedures related to how the mark is discovered, did not enhance mirror selfrecognition. In contrast, maternal scaffolding appears to enhance performance, perhaps by eliciting well-rehearsed verbal responses (i. e., naming self). When comparable testing procedures and assessment criteria are used, chimpanzee and human infants perform comparably.

50|$|It was {{recently}} thought that self-recognition {{was restricted to}} mammals with large brains and highly evolved social cognition but absent from animals without a neocortex. However, in a recent study, an investigation of self-recognition in corvids was carried out, and significant result quantified the ability of self-recognition in the magpie. Mammals and birds inherited the same brain components from their last common ancestor nearly 300 million years ago, and have since independently evolved and formed significantly different brain types. The results of the mirror and <b>mark</b> <b>tests</b> showed that neocortex-less magpies are capable of understanding that a mirror image belongs to their own body. The findings show that magpies respond {{in the mirror and}} <b>mark</b> <b>test</b> {{in a manner similar to}} apes, dolphins and elephants. This is a remarkable capability that, although not fully concrete in its determination of self-recognition, is at least a prerequisite of self-recognition. This is not only of interest regarding the convergent evolution of social intelligence; it is also valuable for an understanding of the general principles that govern cognitive evolution and their underlying neural mechanisms. The magpies were chosen to study based on their empathy/ lifestyle, a possible precursor for their ability of self-awareness.|$|R
