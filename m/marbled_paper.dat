25|$|The Pisani Dossi Ms., titled Flos Duellatorum, was {{believed}} to have been lost in World War II and only resurfaced in a private collection in Italy in 2005. Novati described this manuscript as an unbound collection of leaves, covered with a cardboard folder with a <b>marbled</b> <b>paper</b> cover. The Pisani Dossi Ms. is the only manuscript in the series that includes a date, claiming to be completed on 10 February 1409 after six months of effort. It consists of 36 folia and possesses two different prologues, one in Renaissance Latin and one in Italian. The body of the text consists of four to six illustrations per page, each with only a brief couplet or quatrain to explain it. This manuscript is typically referred to as either the 'Novati' or 'Pisani Dossi version'.|$|E
500|$|The children’s {{publisher}} John Marshall & Co. produced The footstep to Mrs. Trimmer's Sacred history: for {{the instruction}} and amusement of little children in 1785. Trimmer had always advocated {{the use of}} pictorial material in books for children, and the publisher, who was experienced in producing cheap popular prints, was {{in a good position}} to publish them for her. In May 1786 Marshall published A series of prints of scripture history, [...] "designed as ornaments for those apartments in which children receive the first rudiments of their education." [...] The prints were sold [...] "pasted on boards, for hanging up in nurseries" [...] at 1s 6d, in sheets for 8d, sewed in <b>marbled</b> <b>paper</b> ‘for the pocket,’ for 10d. or else neatly bound in read leather at 1s 2d. They were also published with an accompanying small book entitled, A description of a set of prints of scripture history, which was also available in different bindings. The venture proved to be successful and these two works were quickly followed by the publication of five similar ‘Series of Prints’ together with accompanying ‘Descriptions’, compiled by Mrs Trimmer, on the subjects of Ancient history (1786), Roman history (1789), English history (1789), the New Testament (1790) and the Old Testament (1797). These were hugely popular and were reprinted by the Marshalls and their successors at regular intervals over the next thirty years.|$|E

2500|$|Chaloner's next {{target was}} the Bank of England which started trading in 1694. New £100 'bank notes' were {{introduced}} in June 1695, and to prevent forgery they were printed on official <b>marbled</b> <b>paper.</b> Chaloner had large stocks of forged blank paper delivered to his Knightsbridge home, and began producing his own new £100 bank-notes. Surprisingly, this did not become a felony until 1697. The first forgery was detected on 14 August 1695, within two months of their introduction. The forged paper was eventually traced to the printer who informed on Chaloner. Chaloner immediately turned [...] "King's evidence", surrendered his stock of unused paper, named other conspirators to give him credibility, and exposed a major fraud against the bank (one presumably {{in which he was}} himself involved). He testified that blank bills on the [...] "City orphans' fund" [...] were cut from the cheque book in the [...] "Chamber of London" [...] by Aubrey Price and the bank paid out amounts up to £1,000. For his 'efforts' Chaloner received formal thanks from the Bank of England, received a reward of £200 from the bank, and kept all of his profits from the counterfeiting.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Lewisham felt {{a curious}} change of {{atmosphere}} on his entry. The door slammed behind him. The hall with its insistent scholastic suggestions, its yellow <b>marbled</b> <b>paper,</b> its long rows of hat-pegs, its disreputable array of umbrellas, a broken mortar-board and a tattered and scattered Principia, seemed dim and dull {{in contrast with}} the luminous stir of the early March evening outside. An unusual sense of the greyness of a teacher's life, of the greyness indeed of the life of all studious souls came, and went in his mind. He took the [...] "lines," [...] written painfully over three pages of exercise book, and obliterated them with a huge G.E.L., scrawled monstrously across each page. He heard the familiar mingled noises of the playground drifting in to him through the open schoolroom door.|$|E
6000|$|The {{interplay of}} old {{tradition}} and new necessities becomes at times very curious. Consider, for example, the home influences {{of the child}} of a shopman in a large store, or those of {{the child of a}} skilled operative--an engineer of some sort let us say--in England. Both these are new types in the English social body; the former derives from the old middle class, the class that was shopkeeping in the towns and farming in the country, the class of the Puritans, the Quakers, the first manufacturers, the class whose mentally active members become the dissenters, the old Liberals, and the original New Englanders. The growth of large businesses has raised a portion of this class to the position of Sir John Blundell Maple, Sir Thomas Lipton, the intimate friend of our King, and our brewer peers; it has raised a rather more numerous section to the red plush glories of Wagon-Lit trains and their social and domestic equivalents, and it has reduced the bulk of the class to the status of employees for life. But the tradition that our English shopman is in the same class as his master, that he has been apprentice and improver, and is now assistant, with a view to presently being a master himself, still throws its glamour over his life and his home, and his child's upbringing. They belong to the middle class, the black coat and silk-hat class, and the silk hat crowns the adolescence of their boys as inevitably as the toga made men in ancient Rome. Their house is built, not for convenience primarily, but to realize whatever convenience is possible after the rigid traditional requirements have been met; it is the extreme and final reduction of the plan of a better class house, and the very type of its owner. As one sees it in the London suburbs devoted to clerks and shopmen, it stands back a yard or so from the road, with a gate and a railing, and a patch, perhaps two feet wide, of gravel between its front and the pavement. This is the last pathetic vestige of the preliminary privacies of its original type, the gates, the drive-up, the front lawn, the shady trees, that gave a great impressive margin to the door. The door has a knocker (with an appeal to realities, [...] "ring also") and it opens into a narrow passage, perhaps four feet wide, which still retains the title of [...] "hall." [...] Oak staining on the woodwork and <b>marbled</b> <b>paper</b> accentuate the lordly memory. People of this class would rather die than live in a house with a front door, even had it a draught-stopping inner door, that gave upon the street. Instead of an ample kitchen in which meals can be taken and one other room in which the rest of life goes on, these two covering the house site, the social distinction from the servant invades the house space first by necessitating a passage to a side-door, and secondly by cutting up the interior into a [...] "dining-room" [...] and a [...] "drawing-room." [...] Economy of fuel throughout the winter and economy of the best furniture always, keeps the family in the dining-room pretty constantly, but there you have the drawing-room as a concrete fact. Though the drawing-room is inevitable, the family will manage without a bath-room well enough. They may, or they may not, occasionally wash all over. There are probably not fifty books in the house, but a daily paper comes and Tit Bits or Pearson's Weekly, or, perhaps, M.A.P., Modern Society, or some such illuminant of the upper circles, and a cheap fashion paper, appear at irregular intervals to supplement this literature.|$|E
