30|$|A {{close match}} {{is thought to}} be {{desirable}} as productivity and wages are higher when workers can effectively implement their education-related skills (Sattinger 2012). The wage of a worker is jointly influenced by the characteristics of their skills and those of their current job. The larger the discrepancy (i.e., the degree of mismatch), the greater is the potential for the worker to increase their wage by finding a match. Furthermore, collaboration among similarly educated colleagues may lead to a more stimulating work environment and lead to peer effects that can further enhance productivity. These notions are corroborated by the substantial wage effects found in Lemieux (2014) and Yuen (2010) for Canada and Robst (2007) for the USA using a similar self-reported measure as in this article. Furthermore, similar to that found in Lemieux (2014), {{there is no evidence that}} these <b>matching</b> <b>premiums</b> are an artifact of unobserved ability bias.

When the model is estimated under the restriction that the implied average 10 -year term <b>premium</b> <b>matches</b> the observed <b>premium,</b> it turns out that risk aversion and habit only need to rise slightly, while the increase in the term premium is achieved by a drop in the monetary policy parameter that governs the aggressiveness of the monetary policy rule. A less aggressive policy increases the persistence of the reaction of inflation and the short interest rate to any shock, reinforces the covariance between the marginal rate of substitution of consumption and bond prices, turns positive the contribution of the inflation premium and drives the term premium up.

The equity premium is an artifact of comparing an average return to equity with a marginal return to risk-free lending.

40|$|Decades-long trends towards highly {{concentrated}} provider markets in healthcare have serious {{implications for the}} prices of healthcare services, {{one of the leading}} drivers of healthcare spending, and costs for consumers. This study examines the impact of provider consolidation on costs for consumers by analyzing the relationship between hospital market concentration and private insurance premiums in the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) health insurance marketplaces. Herfindahl-Hirschman Indices of market concentration were computed for 51 hospital markets across the nation and those markets were <b>matched</b> with <b>premium</b> data taken from Healthcare. gov via the Kaiser Family Foundation’s annual analysis of premium changes.

40|$|We use {{equity index}} options to {{quantify}} the distribution of consumption growth disasters. The challenge lies in connecting the risk-neutral distribution of equity returns implied by options to the true distribution of consumption growth estimated from macroeconomic data. We attack the problem from three perspectives. First, we compare pricing kernels constructed from macro-finance and option-pricing models. Second, we compare option prices derived from a macro-finance model to those we observe. Third, we compare the distribution of consumption growth derived from option prices using a macro-finance model to estimates based on macroeconomic data. All three perspectives suggest that options imply smaller probabilities of extreme outcomes than have been estimated from international macroeconomic data.

In this paper, we modify a canonical risk-sharing model to generate asset return behavior closer to the data and then consider the effects on welfare gains. To better fit asset return behavior, we introduce persistent consumption risk, finding that the welfare gains depend critically on the international correlation in this persistent risk. We then provide a new identification for this risk by jointly exploiting the data correlation for equity returns and for consumption. This identification implies high correlation in persistent consumption risk, suggesting a strong degree of diversification despite low correlations in transitory risk. As such, our findings show that matching equity returns can imply lower international risk sharing gains than previously thought...|$|R

This {{allows us to}} solve the model for parameter values where the standard “Lucas tree ” model is not de-fined. For these parameters, disasters become more important, and the market risk premium therefore higher, even though consumption is less risky.

40|$|Our paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} heterogeneous trading technologies for households on asset prices {{and the distribution of}} wealth. We distinguish between passive traders who hold fixed portfolios of stocks and bonds, and active traders who adjust their portfolios to changes in expected returns. To solve the model, we derive an optimal consumption sharing rule that does not depend on the trading technology, and we derive an aggregation result for state prices. This allows us to solve for equilibrium prices and allocations without having to search for market clearing prices in each asset market separately. We show that the fraction of total wealth held by active traders, not the fraction held by all participants, is critical for asset prices because only these traders respond to variation in state prices and hence absorb the residual aggregate risk created by non-participants. We calibrate the heterogeneity in trading technologies to <b>match</b> the equity <b>premium</b> and the risk-free rate. The calibrated model reproduces the skewness and kurtosis of the wealth distribution in the data. In contrast to existing asset pricing models with heterogeneous agents, our model matches the high volatility of returns and the low volatility of the risk-free rate.

We start with a theoretical examination of how these different policies create different changes to family budget constraints and produce somewhat different financial incentives for recipients. Next we empirically model the impact of these policies using a competing risk approach to differentiate exits due to transfers to other eligibility categories of public coverage from exiting the public health insurance system.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{implications}} of investors’ everyday mild feelings for aggregate asset returns. To this end, it introduces a novel class of state dependent preferences - happiness maintenance preferences - into the standard Mehra and Prescott (1985) economy by allowing investors’ coefficient of relative risk aversion to depend partly on their current feelings, which, in turn, are {{a function of the}} current state of the economy. Consistent with recent evidence from experimental psychology (see for example Isen (1999)), good times bring about a positive mood for investors and a heightened pain from any potential loss. In an attempt to maintain their good mood, investors become less willing to bear any portfolio risk, i. e. they become more risk averse. Extremely mild procyclical changes (a standard deviation of about one percentage point) in investors’ risk aversion are sufficient to bring {{the implications of}} a simple dynamic model of asset pricing in line with the historically observed stylized features of asset returns, without relying on unreasonable values of the behavioral parameters. With a realistic consumption process, the model is capable of accounting for a sizable equity premium in line with the one observed in the US data.

30|$|Across all groups, {{qualitative}} matching has {{a significant}} effect on wages. A partial match yields roughly a 16 % premium over an unrelated job (the excluded category), while a close <b>match</b> yields a <b>premium</b> of roughly 25 and 30 % for males and females, respectively (Tables 5 and 6; rows 7 and 8; columns 2 for each group) 21. These wage effects are consistent with the notion that productivity is higher when workers are able to use more of their education-related skills on the job. The immigrant interaction terms for partial and close matches reveal that there is no statistically significant difference in the returns between traditional and Canadian-born males (rows 9 and 10; columns 3). In contrast, non-traditional males receive higher returns than natives by 11 and 23 percentage points for partial and close matches, respectively. Thus, matching boosts their productivity more than both natives and traditionals but conversely face greater difficulties adapting in the labor market when not matched. Conceivably, since traditionals likely face less obstacles such as language difficulties and discrimination, their disadvantage when not matched is mitigated. The results reported in column 4 show that when supervisory responsibility (a proxy for innate ability and motivation) is conditioned on, the returns fall only slightly across all stratification groups (column 4; rows 7 – 11). Similar to that found in Nordin et al. (2010) and Lemieux (2014), {{there is little evidence that}} the estimated returns to job match are an artifact of higher ability workers (with higher earning potential) being more likely to secure a job match.
