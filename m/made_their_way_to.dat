5|$|Herodotus {{does not}} mention {{specific}} figures for casualties, merely saying that losses were heavy on both sides. The Sicyonians in particular suffered, also losing their general Perilaus. On the Persian side, the admiral Mardontes and the general Tigranes were both killed, though Artayntes escaped. Herodotus says that a few Persians troops escaped the battle and <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Sardis. Diodorus claims that there were 40,000 Persian casualties, and also suggests that the survivors <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Sardis.|$|E
5|$|Islamic {{methods of}} mathematics, astronomy, and science <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Africa, East Asia and Europe during the Pax Mongolica. Methods of paper-making and {{printing}} {{made their way}} from China to Europe. During the Pax Mongolica rudimentary banking systems were established, and money changing and credit extension were common, resulting in large amount of merchant wealth.|$|E
5|$|After {{the match}} ended, David Sammartino, {{accompanied}} by his father Bruno Sammartino, and Brutus Beefcake, accompanied by Johnny Valiant, <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the ring. The action favoured both contestants, as each wrestler alternated having the advantage. After Beefcake threw David Sammartino out of the ring, Valiant lifted him up and slammed him to the cement floor. He then pushed Sammartino back into the ring before being attacked by Bruno. A short while later, all four men began fighting in the ring, and the match ended in a no-contest.|$|E

5|$|After {{the second}} match ended, Rick Rude and the Junkyard Dog <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the ring. Their match began as Rude {{attacked}} Junkyard Dog from behind, who retaliated by headbutting Rude several times. Subsequently, Rude {{climbed to the}} wrestling ring's top rope and pulled down his tights to reveal another pair of tights {{with a picture of}} Cheryl Roberts on them. As a result, Jake Roberts, Cheryl Roberts' husband, ran to the ring and attacked Rude, forcing the referee to disqualify the Junkyard Dog.|$|E
5|$|Following the match, King Kong Bundy (accompanied by Jimmy Hart) and Special Delivery Jones <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the ring. After {{crushing}} {{his opponent}} against the turnbuckle and landing on him stomach-first, Bundy pinned Jones. The WWF's official {{time for the}} match is a then-record time of nine seconds (a record since surpassed by The Rock defeating Erick Rowan at WrestleMania 32), although the match actually lasted closer to 24 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Shirayuki {{handed over}} the rescued seamen to troops on Endau the {{following}} day. They were never seen again, but {{are believed to have}} been executed in retaliation for losses sustained by the Japanese in an ambush by the Australian 2/18th Battalion, which occurred south of Mersing {{about the same time as}} the naval action off Endau. Davies, four other officers, and 61 ratings from Thanet managed to reach shore and <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Singapore, together with shot down aircrew.|$|E

The breed was recognized officially in North America with acceptance into the Standard of Perfection in 1874. Once Silkies became {{more common in}} the West, many myths were perpetuated about them. Early Dutch breeders told buyers they were the offspring of chickens and rabbits, while sideshows promoted them as having actual mammalian fur.|$|E
5|$|The Red Turban Rebellion saw the {{application}} of early, arrow-firing cannon to both siege and naval warfare in the Southern area of conflict. Following the ascendancy of the Ming Dynasty, cannon were restricted at first to operations pacifying the southern border, including a resounding victory over a band of war-elephants in the 1380s. Cannon <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the northern border by 1414, where their noise had great effect on the Oirats, in addition to reportedly killing several hundred Mongols.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} {{fast mail}} route to the Pacific coast was {{prompted}} largely by California's newfound prominence and its rapidly growing population. After gold was discovered there in 1848, thousands of prospectors, investors and businessmen <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> California, at that time a new territory of the U.S. By 1850, California entered the Union as a free state. By 1860, the population had grown to 380,000. The demand for a faster way to get mail and other communications to and from this westernmost state became even greater as the American Civil War approached.|$|E

The Breens <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> San Juan Bautista where they operated an inn and became the anonymous subjects of J. Ross Browne's story about his severe discomfort upon learning that he was staying with alleged cannibals, printed in Harper's Magazine in 1862. Many of the survivors encountered similar reactions.|$|E
5|$|According to Oleg Gordievsky, {{the highest-ranking}} KGB officer ever to defect, and Pavel Sudoplatov, the former deputy {{director}} of Foreign Intelligence for the Soviet Union, Pontecorvo was a Soviet spy. However, Sudoplatov misidentified Pontecorvo as the spy codenamed Mlad, whom we now know was Ted Hall. While Pontecorvo always denied working on nuclear weapons, in Canada, Britain or the Soviet Union, he never confirmed or denied {{that he was a}} spy. The actual evidence against him was flimsy. Frank Close noted that the blueprints of the Canadian NRX reactor had <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the Soviet Union, and Lona Cohen obtained a sample of uranium from the NRX after it started operation in 1947. Nunn May could not have been the culprit, so Pontecorvo is the prime suspect.|$|E
5|$|After the scuttling of the monitors, around 450 {{officers}} and {{men from the}} Sava and various other riverine vessels gathered at Obrenovac. Armed only with personal weapons and some machine guns stripped from the scuttled vessels, the crews started towards the Bay of Kotor in the southern Adriatic in two groups. The smaller {{of the two groups}} reached its objective, but the larger group only made it as far as Sarajevo by 14 April before they were obliged to surrender. The remainder <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the Bay of Kotor, which was captured by the Italian XVII Corps on 17 April.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Russian Provisional Government declared a general amnesty and offered to fund the return of those Russians who had been exiled as political opponents of the Empire; the entire staff of Golos Truda elected to leave New York City for Russia and to move the periodical to Petrograd. In Vancouver on May 26, 1917, the editors, along with Ferrer Center artist Manuel Komroff and thirteen others, boarded a ship bound for Japan. On board, the anarchists played music, gave lectures, staged plays and even published a revolutionary newspaper, The Float. From Japan, the band <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Siberia, and proceeded East to European Russia.|$|E
5|$|At {{times during}} the last interglacial period (130,000â€“ 70,000 BCE) Europe had a climate warmer than today's, and early humans may have <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> what is now Scotland, though archaeologists have found no traces of this. Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600 BCE. Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} encampments formed the first known settlements, and archaeologists have dated a site near Biggar to around 8500 BCE. Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers, probably with a very low density of population.|$|E

5|$|During the war, {{the castle}} was {{involved}} in an armed stand-off with French naval vessels. After the Fall of France in 1940, some of the French ships had <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> British ports, including Portsmouth, but fears rose that the warships might leave and fall into German hands. On 23 June, the castle was ordered to man its guns and {{to be prepared to}} fire on the French navy to prevent their departure; one gun, albeit not ready for action, was levelled at the fleet and the French destroyer LÃ©opard responded by aiming its guns at the castle, but no shooting ensued. On 3 July, under Operation Grasp, British forces boarded and seized the ships, ending the confrontation.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} events, 91 revolutionaries {{were sentenced to}} exile. Of these, a small group was transported by barges from Giurgiu, {{on their way to}} the Austrian-ruled SviniÈ›a, near the Danube port of Orschowa. The revolutionary artist Constantin Daniel Rosenthal and Maria Rosetti, both of whom had been allowed to go free and had {{subsequently}} followed the barges on shore, pointed out that the Ottomans had stepped out of their jurisdiction, and were able to persuade the mayor of SviniÈ›a to disarm the guards, which in turn allowed the prisoners to flee. The escapees then <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Paris.|$|E
5|$|In Philadelphia itself, the {{combination}} of snow and sleet closed many of the schools, delayed flights, trains and buses. The school district parochial schools were closed on the 14th, as were the regional and central administrative offices. During the midday hours on the 14th, giant slabs of ice slid off tops of buildings in Center City and crashed to the ground. Chunks of ice as large as three feet wide <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the pavement from high up. Police started to block off areas where the ice was falling, however one man {{was hit in the}} head by the falling ice and was knocked to the ground.|$|E
