5|$|Reports {{of the six}} <b>missing</b> <b>women</b> and Sparks's brutal beating {{appeared}} {{prominently in}} newspapers and on television throughout Washington and Oregon. Fear spread among the population; hitchhiking by young women dropped sharply. While pressure mounted on law enforcement agencies, the paucity of physical evidence severely hampered them. Police could not provide reporters with the little information that was available for fear of compromising the investigation. Further similarities between the victims were noted: The disappearances all took place at night, usually near ongoing construction work, {{within a week of}} midterm or final exams; all of the victims were wearing slacks or blue jeans; and at most crime scenes, there were sightings of a man wearing a cast or a sling, and driving a brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.|$|E
25|$|Some {{critics argue}} {{that the lack of}} results arising from this {{investigation}} is the result of systemic racism. This was also believed to be an issue in the case of Vancouver's <b>missing</b> <b>women</b> and the Robert Pickton murders. The issue of systemic racism in these cases is explored in Finding Dawn, the 2006 documentary by Christine Welsh whose film includes a section on the Highway of Tears victim Ramona Wilson, including interviews with family and community members. Often overlooked in reports on the Highway of Tears is the fact that over half of the <b>missing</b> <b>women</b> are First Nation.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the course}} of the next three years, Hiscox noticed that women who visited the farm {{eventually}} went missing. On February 6, 2002, police executed a search warrant for illegal firearms at the property. After the Picktons were taken into custody, police obtained a second court order to search the farm as part of the BC <b>Missing</b> <b>Women</b> Investigation. Personal items belonging to <b>missing</b> <b>women</b> were found at the farm, which was sealed off by members of the joint RCMP–Vancouver Police Department task force. The following day Pickton was charged with weapons offences. He was later released and was kept under police surveillance.|$|E

25|$|Across Canada, {{there has}} been a large number of missing and murdered women of Aboriginal descent since 1980. 16% of female murder victims and 12% of <b>missing</b> <b>women</b> have been Aboriginal, while demographically they {{comprise}} only 4% of the overall female population. This amounts to almost 1,200 Aboriginal females either missing or murdered in just over 30 years.|$|E

The property was once owned by Leland Vincent Switzer, who is currently serving a prison sentence for the second-degree murder of his brother.

25|$|In March 2006, various Aboriginal groups {{hosted a}} two-day Highway of Tears {{symposium}} at the CN Center in Prince George. In attendance {{to the event}} were the victim's families and over 500 Aboriginal leaders from across British Columbia. Shortly thereafter, the Highway of Tears Symposium Recommendation Report was issued with 33 recommendations to improve public transit, deter hitchhiking, and prevent violence towards Aboriginal women. Some of the recommendations from the report include a shuttle bus operation along Highway 16, improved educational, health and social services for Aboriginal people as well counseling and mental health groups organized by Aboriginal workers. These propositions {{are part of a}} long-term recommendation to directly confront the issue of First Nations intergenerational poverty. The Highway of Tears Symposium Recommendation Report was endorsed by B.C. inquiry commissioner Wally Oppal in his 2012 <b>Missing</b> <b>Women</b> Commission of Inquiry recommendations. Oppal's public inquiry report into the Robert Pickton case demanded urgent transportation improvement along Highway 16. Like the Highway of Tears Symposium Recommendation Report, Oppal's report also suggested implementing a shuttle bus service along Highway 16 to deter young women from hitchhiking.|$|E
25|$|A {{preliminary}} inquiry {{was held in}} 2003, the testimony from which was covered by a publication ban until 2010. At the inquiry, the fact that Pickton {{had been charged with}} attempted murder in connection with the stabbing of prostitute Wendy Lynn Eistetter in 1997 was revealed. Eistetter testified at the inquiry that after he had driven her to the Port Coquitlam farm and had sex with her, Pickton slapped a handcuff on her left hand and stabbed her in the abdomen. She stabbed Pickton in self defense. Later, both she and Pickton were treated at the same hospital, where staff used a key they found in Pickton's pocket to remove the handcuffs from the woman's wrist. The attempted-murder charge against Pickton was stayed on January 27, 1998, because the woman had drug addiction issues and prosecutors believed her too unstable for her testimony to help secure a conviction. The clothes and rubber boots Pickton had been wearing that evening were seized by police and left in an RCMP storage locker for more than seven years. Not until 2004 did lab testing show that the DNA of two <b>missing</b> <b>women</b> were on the items seized from Pickton in 1997.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft's {{work has}} also {{had an effect on}} {{feminism}} outside the academy in recent years.

British writer Caitlin Moran, author of the best-selling How to Be a Woman, described herself as [...] "half Wollstonecraft" [...] to the New Yorker. She has also inspired more widely.

500|$|Detectives {{from the}} King County Sheriff's Office and the Seattle Police Department grew {{increasingly}} concerned. There {{was no significant}} physical evidence, and the <b>missing</b> <b>women</b> had little in common, apart from being young, attractive, white college students with long hair parted in the middle. On June 1, Brenda Carol Ball, 22, disappeared after leaving the Flame Tavern in Burien, Washington, near Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. She was last seen {{in the parking lot}} talking to a brown-haired man with his arm in a sling. In the early hours of June 11, UW student Georgann [...] Hawkins vanished while walking down a brightly lit alley between her boyfriend's dormitory residence and her sorority house. The next morning, three Seattle homicide detectives and a criminalist combed the entire alleyway on their hands and knees, finding nothing. After Hawkins's disappearance was publicized, witnesses came forward to report seeing a man that night in an alley behind a nearby dormitory, on crutches with a leg cast, struggling to carry a briefcase. One woman recalled that the man asked her to help him carry the case to his car, a light brown Volkswagen Beetle.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} long term {{economic}} impact of severe obstetric complications for women and their children in Burkina Faso, focusing on measures of food security, expenditures and related quality of life measures. It uses a hospital based cohort, first visited in 2004 / 2005 and followed up four years later. This cohort of 1014 women consisted of two main groups of comparison: 677 women who had an uncomplicated delivery and 337 women who experienced a severe obstetric complication which would have almost certainly caused death had they not received hospital care (labelled a "near miss" event). To analyze the impact of such near miss events {{as well as the}} possible interaction with the pregnancy outcome, we compared household and individual level indicators between women without a near <b>miss</b> event and <b>women</b> with a near miss event who either had a live birth, a perinatal death or an early pregnancy loss. We used propensity score matching to remove initial selection bias. Although we found limited effects for the whole group of near <b>miss</b> <b>women,</b> the results indicated negative impacts: a) for near <b>miss</b> <b>women</b> with a live birth, on child development and education, on relatively expensive food consumption and on women's quality of life; b) for near <b>miss</b> <b>women</b> with perinatal death, on relatively expensive foods consumption and children's education and c) for near <b>miss</b> <b>women</b> who had an early pregnancy loss, on overall food security. Our results showed that severe obstetric complications have long lasting consequences for different groups of women and their children and highlighted the need for carefully targeted interventions...|$|R
