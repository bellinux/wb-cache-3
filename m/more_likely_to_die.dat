5|$|Larvae of Sirex {{woodwasp}} develop through arrhenotoky: male larvae develop {{only from}} unfertilized eggs, the females only from fertilized ones. Usually, 10 males are produced per female, but the ratio varies between 20:1 and 1:1. The larvae hatch after eight {{days at the}} earliest, but in some exterior conditions, they may remain in the egg for several months. At the optimal temperature of around 25°C (77°F), they hatch out after 10 to 12 days. Although the larvae hatch at 30°C (86°F) {{two to three days}} earlier, they are 20% <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> Such extreme temperatures result in slower development, and below 6.2°C (43°F), the larvae die. A sufficient interspersion of the wood with the mycelium of the woodwasp is crucial for its hatching, as the fungus prevents the wood from drying out. Without these prerequisites, hatching is not possible. The tree can only ward off the infestation if it floods the boreholes with resin or halts the fungus by producing a wall of polyphenols.|$|E

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{relation}} between residential mobility and well-being {{in a sample of}} 7, 108 American adults who were followed for 10 years. The more residential moves participants had experienced as children, the lower the levels of well-being as adults. As predicted, however, the negative association between the number of residential moves and well-being was observed among introverts but not among extraverts. We further demonstrated that the negative association between residential mobility and well-being among introverts was explained by the relative lack of close social relationships. Finally, we found that introverts who had moved frequently as children were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>died</b> during the 10 -year follow-up. Among extraverts, childhood residential mobility was unrelated to their mortality risk as adults. These findings indicate that residential moves can be a risk factor for introverts and that extraversion can be an interpersonal resource for social relationships and well-being in mobile societies...|$|R
40|$|Male facial width-to-height ratio (bizygomatic width scaled for face height) is a testosterone-linked trait {{predictive}} of reactive aggression, exploitative behavior, cheating, deception, and dominance.

We hypothesized that wider-faced males, being more aggressive and robust, would be less likely than narrower-faced males <b>to</b> <b>die</b> from contact violence (stabbed, strangled, or bludgeoned to death) compared with other forms of homicide. We tested this hypothesis in a forensic data sample covering 523 male and 339 female skeletons. In these data, men with narrower faces were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>died</b> as a consequence of homicides involving direct physical contact than men with wider faces. No such effect was found for women. This effect was found when considering all causes of mortality and when limiting the sample to homicides. This finding suggests that wider-faced males are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> from male male physical violence, perhaps because of their formidability. Our findings are discussed with reference to the previous literature indicating that facial width-to-height ratio is a marker for male dominance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: According to some studies, {{women with}} heart disease receive fewer {{procedures}} and have higher in-hospital death rates than men. These studies vary by data source (hospital discharge abstract versus detailed clinical information) and severity measurement methods. The authors examined whether evaluations of gender differences for acute myocardial infarction patients vary by data source and severity measure. METHODS: The authors considered 10 severity measures: four using clinical medical record data and six using discharge abstracts (diagnosis and procedure codes). The authors studied all 14, 083 patients admitted in 1991 for acute myocardial infarction to 100 hospitals nationwide, examining in-hospital death and use of coronary angiography, {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery (CABG), and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for death and procedure use for women compared with men, controlling for age and each of the severity scores. RESULTS: After adjusting only for age, women were significantly <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than men <b>to</b> <b>die</b> and less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> receive CABG and coronary angiography. Severity measures provided different assessments of whether women were sicker than men; for all cases, clinical data-based MedisGroups rated women 2 ̆ 7 s severity compared with men 2 ̆ 7 s, whereas four code-based severity measures viewed women as sicker. After adjusting for severity and age, women were significantly <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than men <b>to</b> <b>die</b> in-hospital and less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> receive coronary angiography and CABG; women and men had relatively equal adjusted odds ratios of receiving PTCA. Odds ratios reflecting gender differences in procedure use and death rates were similar across severity measures.

40|$|Background: Guideline-concordant therapies for {{survivors}} of an {{acute coronary syndrome}} (ACS) hospitalization require healthcare access, something that millions of Americans lack. Methods and Results: Using data from a prospective cohort study of over 2, 000 survivors of a hospitalization for an ACS in central Massachusetts and Georgia from 2011 to 2013, the first two aims of this thesis sought to identify the post-discharge consequences for survival and health status of having: 1) financial barriers to healthcare, 2) no usual source of care, and 3) transportation barriers. We found that patients lacking a usual source of care and having a transportation barrier were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>died</b> within two years following hospital discharge compared to those without such barriers. Also, patients with financial barriers <b>to</b> healthcare were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> experience clinically meaningful declines in physical and mental health-related quality of life over the six months after hospital discharge. The third aim sought to better understand factors influencing the success of care transitions home after an unplanned hospitalization through a qualitative study of 22 patients. Participants described how adequate healthcare access, particularly having insurance and transportation to clinical appointments, facilitated the receipt of follow-up care and adherence to treatments. Conclusions: Limitations in healthcare access may contribute to poorer survival, health-related quality of life, and survival.

25|$|Several {{studies have}} found that black women in the U.S. are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> from breast cancer even though white {{women are more likely to}} be {{diagnosed}} with the disease. Even after diagnosis, black women are less likely to get treatment compared to white women. Scholars have advanced several theories for the disparities, including inadequate access to screening, reduced availability of the most advanced surgical and medical techniques, or some biological characteristic of the disease in the African American population. Some studies suggest that the racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes may reflect cultural biases more than biological disease differences. However, the lack of diversity in clinical trials for breast cancer treatment may contribute to these disparities, with recent research indicating that black women are more likely to have estrogen receptor negative breast cancers, which are not responsive to hormone treatments that are effective for most white women. Research is currently ongoing to define the contribution of both biological and cultural factors.|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{patterns}} in aggregations form {{as a result}} of the interplay between costs and benefits experienced by individuals. Such self-organisation of aggregations can be explained using a zonal model in which a short-range zone of repulsion and longer-range zone of attraction surrounding individuals leads to emergent pattern properties. The signal of these processes can be detected using spatial pattern analyses. Furthermore, in sessile organisms, post-settlement mortality reveals the relative costs and benefits of positions within the aggregation. Acorn barnacles are known to require contact with conspecifics for reproduction and are therefore believed to aggregate for this purpose; isolated individuals may also be more susceptible to abiotic stress and predation. At short distances, however, competition for space and resources is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> occur. In this study spatial patterns of barnacles (Semibalanus balanoides L.) were analysed using pair-correlation functions. Individuals were dispersed at distances below 0. 30 cm, but peak relative density occurred at a distance of 0. 36 cm from conspecifics. This is much closer than required for reproductive access, implying a strong aggregative drive, up to the point of physical contact with neighbours. Nevertheless, analysis of dead barnacles illustrated that such proximity carries a cost as barnacles with many neighbours were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>died.</b> The inferences obtained from these patterns are that barnacles aggregate as closely as they can, and that local neighbourhood competition is a powerful determinant of mortality. These processes give rise to the observed pattern properties...|$|R
