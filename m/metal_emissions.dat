The Convention has been extended by eight protocols that identify specific measures to be taken by Parties to cut their emissions of air pollutants.The Executive Body adopted the Protocol on Heavy Metals on 24 June 1998 in Aarhus (Denmark). It targets three particularly harmful metals: cadmium, lead and mercury. According to one of the basic obligations, Parties will have to reduce their emissions for these three metals below their levels in 1990 (or an alternative year between 1985 and 1995). The Protocol aims to cut emissions from industrial sources (iron and steel industry, non-ferrous metal industry), combustion processes (power generation, road transport) and waste incineration. It lays down stringent limit values for emissions from stationary sources and suggests best available techniques (BAT) for these sources, such as special filters or scrubbers for combustion sources or mercury-free processes. The Protocol requires Parties to phase out leaded petrol. It also introduces measures to lower heavy <b>metal</b> <b>emissions</b> from other products, such as mercury in batteries, and proposes the introduction of management measures for other mercury-containing products, such as electrical components (thermostats, switches), measuring devices (thermometers, manometers, barometers), fluorescent lamps, dental amalgam, pesticides and paint.|$|E

In this study, the emissions of metal and organic compounds were investigated under oxygen deficient and oxygen surplus conditions for the RDF and such high volume contributors as office papers and magazines. The principal <b>metal</b> <b>emissions</b> of the RDF were Al, Ca, K, Si, and Zn. Magazines significantly contribute B, Mg, Mn, Ti emissions, whereas office papers contributed Ti and Zn emissions.

40|$|This {{working paper}} {{describes}} those determinants of intrasectoral change within the sector of non-ferrous metal {{production in the}} Ruhr Area, Northrhine-Westfalia, which contributed to the reduction of atmospheric heavy <b>metal</b> <b>emissions</b> since the mid-sixties, {{as well as the}} driving forces behind these intrasectoral changes. It constitutes part of the Rhine/Black Triangle Policy Comparison Study at IIASA. Intrasectoral changes pertaining to the emission of atmospheric heavy metals are shown to have consisted, in the first place, of process changes whose main characteristic was increased processing of production residues, i. e. a closing of economic (material) cycles, thus increasing recycling and decreasing waste. The second most important development was the application of gradually improved off-gas collection and cleaning technologies (end-of-pipe technologies). Closures of old plants also have contributed to the decrease in heavy <b>metal</b> <b>emissions.</b> Although capacities were increased during the period of the investigation (1955 to 1988), these capacity increases were brought about with modernized technologies, which are less emission intensive than those used in the older plants. Three major factors were the driving forces behind the intrasectoral change: developments in legal requirements (air pollution control); economic motivations of the enterprises; and financial support from public institutions. An open question is whether various residues resulting from the more modern processing technologies are, from an environmental point of view, more hazardous than heavy <b>metal</b> <b>emissions...</b>|$|E
