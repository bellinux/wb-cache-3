25|$|Possibly an {{important}} contribution from Gerard Murphy to the book, or <b>maybe</b> <b>something</b> he picked up while engaged in it, was a facility for explaining things particularly well. Later, in 1990, Gerard published a book called C*-algebras and operator theory (Academic Press) which has remained a standard reference. It covers the basics of the theory but also dips in to the more advanced and modern aspects {{in such a way}} that many new students of C*-algebras continue to fnd it a valuable introduction, preferable for the beginner to many fatter and more encyclopedic volumes.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, {{the first}} {{official}} tie-in comic was released. Quesada outlined his plan to expand the MCU into comic books, saying, [...] "The MCU [...] {{are going to be}} stories set within movie continuity. [...] not necessarily direct adaptations of the movies, but <b>maybe</b> <b>something</b> that happened off screen and was mentioned in the movie ... Kevin Feige is involved with these and in some cases maybe the writers of the movies would be involved [...] " [...] Marvel Comics worked with Brad Winderbaum, Jeremy Latcham, and Will Corona Pilgrim at Marvel Studios to decide which concepts should be carried over from the Marvel Comics Universe to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, what to show in the tie-in comics, and what to leave for the films. Marvel has clarified which of the tie-in comics are considered official canonical MCU stories, with the rest merely inspired by the MCU, [...] "where we get to show off all the characters from the film in costume and in comic form." ...|$|E
500|$|Because Jones's costume {{does not}} evolve much {{throughout}} the season, Maslansky used flashbacks {{to show how}} her costume had evolved to the present day: for 'pre-Kilgrave' Jessica Jones, Maslansky gave the character [...] "more pulled together" [...] clothes, albeit [...] "still kind of edgy" [...] clothes that did not change who she was as a character, but were just [...] "different". For instance, in a flashback to Jones working in a corporate environment, she does not wear a suit, instead [...] "wear her jeans and find a really cool jacket, maybe a vintage thing, <b>maybe</b> <b>something</b> that she borrowed from Trish". For a flashback where Jones wears a large sandwich costume, a [...] "variety" [...] of costumes were ordered online, with the chosen suit then distressed to [...] "look dirty and old"; [...] "a mere shadow of its former sandwich self," [...] becoming [...] "more of a hoagie than a sandwich." [...] In another flashback, Jones imagines escaping Kilgrave's control. The bright yellow dress the character wears in the dream sequence was chosen for its juxtaposition to the character's real situation, with Maslansky calling it [...] "so beautiful and so free and so light".|$|E

2500|$|On July 6, 2017, Francesa and Russo {{attended}} the SiriusXM Town Hall meeting moderated by actor Chazz Palminteri, {{a week before}} a 30 for 30 documentary on Francesa and Russo went on the air. Regarding the possibility of reunions, Francesa says, [...] "“first, someone has to make an offer, which no one has yet. But if something comes up, I’ll always listen.” And Russo says, [...] "I think we both know we could easily do shows together. I {{think it would be}} sporadic — maybe one day a week, <b>maybe</b> <b>something</b> around big events." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2006, 500 {{supporters}} including {{world champion}} boxers Koichi Wajima and Katsuo Tokashiki submitted {{letters to the}} Supreme Court asking for a retrial. [...] In March 2007, Norimichi Kumamoto, {{one of the three}} judges who had originally convicted Hakamada, came out in support of Hakamada's innocence. He stated that he had doubted the authenticity of the confession and believed Hakamada to be innocent. However, he had failed to persuade his two more senior colleagues, resulting in the split judgment for conviction. [...] He eventually resigned his position out of guilt for the conviction. The revelation came in spite of a strong tradition against revealing the discussions between judges, and it resulted in Kumamoto being highly criticized. [...] "I’m glad I spoke up," [...] he said. [...] "I wish I had said it earlier, and <b>maybe</b> <b>something</b> might have changed." [...] He tried to visit Hakamada in prison to apologize personally, but his request was denied.|$|E

6000|$|... "About that, sir. There {{were ten}} full, {{and under the}} {{millstones}} was a great bin holding, I should say, half as much more. Moreover, we have ridden far over the country, and have gathered up twelve head of cattle, four horses, and a score of sheep.

60|$|They stood grouped about, {{looking on}} in silence, Rotherby in the background. Behind him again, on the topmost {{of the three}} steps that led up into the inner hall, stood Mistress Winthrop, white of face, a wild horror in the eyes she riveted upon the wounded and {{unconscious}} man. She {{realized that he was}} like to die. There was an infinite pity in her soul--and, <b>maybe,</b> <b>something</b> more. Her impulse was to go to him; her every instinct urged her.

6000|$|Well, {{that night}} we had OUR show; but there warn't only about twelve people there--just enough to pay expenses. And they laughed all the time, and that made the duke mad; and {{everybody}} left, anyway, before the show was over, but one boy which was asleep. So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads couldn't come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted was low comedy--and <b>maybe</b> <b>something</b> ruther worse than low comedy, he reckoned. He said he could size their style. So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off some handbills, and stuck them {{up all over the}} village. The bills said: ...|$|E

6000|$|But not for long. It worried {{me all the}} afternoon. I thought, <b>maybe,</b> <b>something</b> {{would come}} {{to me in the}} evening. I wasted all that evening, and I wasted all the {{following}} morning. Everything has its amusing side, I told myself. One turns out comic stories about funerals, about weddings. Hardly a misfortune that can happen to mankind but has produced its comic literature. An American friend of mine once took a contract from the Editor of an Insurance Journal to write four humorous stories; one was to deal with an earthquake, the second with a cyclone, the third with a flood, and the fourth with a thunderstorm. And more amusing stories I have never read. What is the matter with the Fiscal question? ...|$|E
6000|$|Away {{late that}} night we were coming up-town in a horse-car when three boisterous roughs got aboard, and began to fling hilarious obscenities and profanities right and left among the timid passengers, {{some of whom were}} women and children. Nobody {{resisted}} or retorted; the conductor tried soothing words and moral suasion, but the toughs only called him names and laughed at him. Very soon I saw that the Major realised that this was a matter which was in his line; evidently he was turning over his stock of diplomacy in his mind and getting ready. I felt that the first diplomatic remark he made in this place would bring down a landslide of ridicule upon him, and <b>maybe</b> <b>something</b> worse; but before I could whisper to him and check him he had begun, and it was too late. He said, in a level and dispassionate tone: ...|$|E
6000|$|In my {{own case}} my inward {{watchman}} is, perhaps, somewhat out of practice. He does his best; {{but he is}} over-anxious; he worries himself, and loses count. I say to him, maybe, [...] "Five-thirty, please;" [...] and he wakes me with a start at half-past two. I look at my watch. He suggests that, perhaps, I forgot to wind it up. I put it to my ear; it is still going. He thinks, <b>maybe,</b> <b>something</b> has happened to it; he is confident himself it is half-past five, if not a little later. To satisfy him, I {{put on a pair}} of slippers and go downstairs to inspect the dining-room clock. What happens to a man when he wanders about the house in the middle of the night, clad in a dressing-gown and a pair of slippers, there is no need to recount; most men know by experience. Everything--especially everything with a sharp corner--takes a cowardly delight in hitting him. When you are wearing a pair of stout boots, things get out of your way; when you venture among furniture in woolwork slippers and no socks, it comes at you and kicks you. I return to bed bad tempered, and refusing to listen to his further absurd suggestion that all the clocks in the house have entered into a conspiracy against me, take half an hour to get to sleep again. From four to five he wakes me every ten minutes. I wish I had never said a word to him about the thing. At five o'clock he goes to sleep himself, worn out, and leaves it to the girl, who does it half an hour later than usual.|$|E
5000|$|I don't {{know anyone}} else {{who has been on}} as many shows as I have at my age and hasn't had a hit, You'd think a track record like that would {{discourage}} people from hiring me. But I think it works in my favor. Because I've had the opportunity to work a lot and not be pigeonholed. <b>Maybe</b> there's <b>something</b> to this one season- and-out thing.|$|R
50|$|I think I {{just really}} needed {{a break from}} it. It had lost its magic for me. Totally. Also, for some reason, I {{had to have a}} bit of a {{rebellion}} against AAE. <b>Maybe</b> it's <b>something</b> along the lines of why teenagers fall out with their parents and find everything about them embarrassing... Then they grow up a bit and realise that their Mum and Dad aren't too bad at all.|$|R
50|$|Spenser {{decides to}} trail Professor Hayden and <b>maybe</b> learn <b>something.</b> He sees two thugs get into Hayden's {{car at the}} {{university}} and Spenser follows them to Jamaica Pond and {{by then it was}} dark. The two gunmen intended to kill Hayden, but Spenser killed one and took a bullet in his side from the other. After crawling away, he managed to kill the other gunman, but instead of helping Spenser, Hayden ran away.|$|R
