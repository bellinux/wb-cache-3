2500|$|The modern {{phenomenon}} of fan fiction {{as an expression}} of fandom and fan interaction was popularized and defined via Star Trek fandom and their fanzines published in the 1960s. The first Star Trek fanzine, Spockanalia (1967), contained some fan fiction; many others followed its example. These fanzines were produced via offset printing and <b>mimeography,</b> and mailed to other fans or sold at science fiction conventions for a small fee to help recoup costs. Unlike other aspects of fandom, women dominated fan fiction authoring; 83% of Star Trek fan fiction authors were female by 1970, and 90% by 1973. One scholar states that fan fiction [...] "fill the need of a mostly female audience for fictional narratives that expand the boundary of the official source products offered on the television and movie screen." ...|$|E
5000|$|Compared to spirit duplication, <b>mimeography</b> {{produced}} a darker, more legible image. Spirit duplicated images were usually tinted a light purple or lavender, which gradually became lighter {{over the course}} of some dozens of copies. <b>Mimeography</b> was often considered [...] "the next step up" [...] in quality, capable of producing hundreds of copies. Print runs beyond that level were usually produced by professional printers, or as the technology became available, xerographic copiers.|$|E
5000|$|Screen {{printing}} {{also uses}} a stencil process, as does <b>mimeography.</b> The masters from which mimeographed pages are printed are often called [...] "stencils". Stencils {{can be made}} with one or many colour layers using different techniques, with most stencils designed to be applied as solid colours. During screen printing and <b>mimeography</b> the images for stenciling are broken down into color layers. Multiple layers of stencils are used on the same surface to produce multi-colored images.|$|E
50|$|There {{are still}} <b>mimeography</b> enthusiasts in the United States and Canada, and mimeo {{technology}} {{is still in}} everyday use in the Third World, since many low-cost mimeograph machines do not require electricity to operate.|$|E
50|$|Ditto {{machines}} and mimeograph machines were competing and complementary technologies {{during the first}} half of the 20th century. <b>Mimeography</b> was in general a more forgiving technology, and still survives in various forms into the 21st century.|$|E
50|$|Although mimeographs remain more {{economical}} and energy-efficient in mid-range quantities, easier-to-use photocopying and offset printing have replaced <b>mimeography</b> almost entirely in developed countries. Mimeograph machines {{continue to be}} used in developing countries because it is a simple, cheap, and robust technology. Many mimeographs can be hand-cranked, requiring no electricity.|$|E
50|$|Games {{was also}} an {{industrial}} designer of sorts. Activities in this discipline included {{the design of the}} 1947 Cona vacuum coffee maker (produced from 1949, reworked in 1959 and still in production) and inventions such as a circular vacuum cleaner and an early 1960s portable handheld duplicating machine by Gestetner, which was not put into production due to the demise of <b>mimeography.</b>|$|E
5000|$|One of Canada's longest running early little magazines, grOnk ran {{for well}} over 100 issues {{in a wide variety}} of formats & {{utilizing}} diverse print technologies such as rubberstamp, <b>mimeography,</b> offset and later xerography, including many hand-wrought additions (for examples, John Riddell's [...] "A hOle in the Head" [...] included many handcoloured pages & scissor-cut windows, while jwcurry's [...] "AS IS OR WITH" [...] was drawn entirely by hand throughout the edition). David UU (David W. Harris) was co-editor for the first series (8 issues, 1967), and editor of most of the 7th series (5 of 8 issues, 1971).|$|E
50|$|The Radville Public School, a {{traditional}} 3 story cube shaped red brick building, {{burned to the}} ground on Sunday January 23, 1977 (date requires confirmation). A <b>mimeography</b> machine with its alcohol based image transfer fluid created an explosion in the staff office on the second floor. Picture windows across the street were cracked {{as a result of the}} explosion. The new Radville Elementary School opened a few years later. In the interim, the students were sent to some reserved classrooms in the high school, and the younger students were sent to the Catholic school. The principal at the time of the fire was Warren Blackstock.|$|E
