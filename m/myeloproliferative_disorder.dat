40|$|Abstract Introduction Transient <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> is a hematologic {{abnormality}} {{characterized by}} an uncontrolled proliferation of myeloblasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow that primarily affects newborns and babies with Down syndrome. Tumor lysis syndrome is rarely associated with transient <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorder.</b> Case presentation Transient <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> was diagnosed in a seven-day-old baby girl with Down syndrome, who was referred to our department due to hyperleukocytosis. Our patient developed tumor lysis syndrome, successfully treated with rasburicase, as a complication of transient <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> resulting from rapid degradation of myeloid blasts after initiation of effective chemotherapy. Conclusions Tumor lysis syndrome is rarely reported as a complication of transient <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorder.</b> To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first case of a newborn with Down syndrome and transient <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> treated with rasburicase for developing tumor lysis syndrome. </p...|$|E
