50|$|A digital minilab is a {{computer}} printer that uses traditional chemical photographic processes to make prints from digital images. Photographs are input to the digital minilab using a built-in film scanner that captures images from negative and positive photographic films (including <b>mounted</b> <b>slides),</b> flatbed scanners, a kiosk that accepts CD-ROMs or memory cards from a digital camera, or a website that accepts uploads. The operator can make many corrections such as brightness or color saturation, contrast, scene lighting color correction, sharpness and cropping. A laser, LCD/LED, or Micro Light Valve Array (MLVA) then exposes photographic paper with the image, which is then processed by the minilab just {{as if it had}} been exposed from a negative.|$|E
5000|$|This type of scanner is {{sometimes}} called a slide or transparency scanner and it works by passing a narrowly focused beam of light through the film and reading the intensity and color of the light that emerges. [...] "Usually, uncut film strips of up to six frames, or four <b>mounted</b> <b>slides,</b> are inserted in a carrier, which is moved by a stepper motor across a lens and CCD sensor inside the scanner. Some models are mainly used for same-size scans. Film scanners vary {{a great deal in}} price and quality." [...] The lowest-cost dedicated film scanners can be had for less than $50 and they might be sufficient for modest needs. From there they inch up in staggered levels of quality and advanced features upward of five figures. [...] "The specifics vary by brand and model and the end results are greatly determined by the level of sophistication of the scanner's optical system and, equally important, the sophistication of the scanning software." ...|$|E
30|$|For staining, {{the slides}} were rinsed in {{distilled}} water and stained in hematoxylin (Merck, Germany). Slides were counterstained in eosin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and dehydrated, cleared, and <b>mounted.</b> <b>Slides</b> were viewed with slide scanner (Zeiss, Germany).|$|E

30|$|From a {{mechanical}} engineering/manufacturing perspective {{it is the}} output of the confocal microscope that makes it most apparently attractive, voxels and.tif files, as well as the huge convenience as a data acquisition source, using simply <b>mounted</b> <b>slides.</b> Stacked an image is produced in.avi format ready for virtual reality applications.|$|E

30|$|Also, {{alizarin}} red {{was used}} to identify calcium in tissue sections such as the bone, and the Alcian Blue {{was used to}} identify mucosubstances of connective tissues. The first step for staining is deparaffinization then rehydration and staining with Alcian Blue solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Slides were washed and stained in alizarin red stain solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Slides were dehydrated, cleared, and <b>mounted.</b> <b>Slides</b> were viewed with slide scanner (Zeiss, Germany).|$|E

50|$|In Acanthamoeba infections, the {{diagnosis}} {{can be made}} from microscopic examination of stained smears of biopsy specimens (brain tissue, skin, cornea) or of corneal scrapings, which may detect trophozoites and cysts. Cultivation of the causal organism, and its identification by direct immunofluorescent antibody, may also prove useful. Laboratory workers and physicians often mistake the organisms on wet mount for monocytes and a diagnosis of viral meningitis is mistakenly given if the organisms are not motile. Heating a copper penny with an alcohol lamp and placing it on the wet <b>mount</b> <b>slide</b> will activate sluggish trophozoites and more rapidly make {{the diagnosis}}. If the person performing the spinal tap rapidly looks at the heated wet <b>mount</b> <b>slide</b> the trophozoites can be seen to swarm while monocytes do not.|$|R
30|$|All {{the samples}} were {{subjected}} to concentration (by formal-ether sedimentation method and Sheather’s sucrose floatation technique). Microscopic examination was done by saline wet mount, iodine wet mount and modified acid-fast staining technique. The <b>mounted</b> <b>slides</b> were examined under low power (10 X) followed by high power (40 X) and acid-fast stained smears were examined using oil immersion (100 X).

30|$|The {{identification}} of the genera poses problem since the organic extensions usually disappear after frustule cleaning treatment that diatoms are subjected to for microscopic observation.

As such observations {{need to be made}} before cleaning the frustules as simple water <b>mounted</b> <b>slides.</b> But though this marine genus has both fultoportulae and rimoportulae, and could have been included in Thalassiosira, it is preferable to maintain the two genera separately, {{on the basis of the}} extended wing since the genus is already large and extremely diverse.|$|E

40|$|While I {{was on duty}} {{with the}} Naval Institute of Tropical Hygiene at Macassar, Celebes, during World War &# 8545;, I had the {{opportunity}} to examine various wild and domestic animals for parasites, these animals being taken mainly from Celebes.

I collected a fairly large amount of material from monkeys, buffaloes, birds, lizards, snakes and fishes, the latter being examined very carefully from the stand-point of prevention of parasitic infections transmitted from fish to man.

Briefly, sections of paraffin-embedded brain from control and permanent global brain ischemia induced due to hanging (0, 1, 3, 6 and 12  h) were deparaffinised in xyline overnight and then rehydrated with different graded ethanol. The slides were washed thrice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (0.01  M, pH  7.4) and then treated with 0.3 % H 2 O 2 in absolute methanol for 15  min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. The slides were washed twice with PBS and then exposed to PBS containing 0.1 % Triton X- 100 to for permeabilization. Slides were then exposed to 100  μl of blocking buffer (0.5 % BSA, 0.1 % tween- 20 in 100  ml PBS) {{at room temperature for}} 1  h and then incubated with an anti-p 53 antibody (sc- 6423; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by SYBR green-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., CA, USA) at a dilution of 1 : 1000 in PBS at room temperature for 1  h in a humidified chamber.

30|$|In this study, we {{analyzed}} {{changes in the}} radiolarian assemblage for 124 samples at about 0.5 to 1.5  m intervals between 0 and 180  m CCSF-D. To monitor changes in the northern ECS hydrography, changes in radiolarian assemblages and absolute abundances were analyzed for a continuum of the past 400 kyr. Additionally, we estimated the variation in summer SST and intermediate water temperature {{at a depth of}} ca. 500  m by applying the method proposed by Matsuzaki and Itaki (2017). Two types of microscopic slides were mounted: faunal slides (F-slides) and quantitative slide (Q-slides). The first preparation steps were similar for both types of slide: the 124 samples were freeze-dried, treated with diluted hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) (15 %, i.e., 50  ml of H 2 O 2 at a concentration of 30 % diluted in 100  ml of water) and hydrochloric acid (15 %) (40  ml of HCl at a concentration of 35 – 37 % diluted in 100  m of water) to remove organic and calcareous matter. The undissolved residue in each sample was sieved through a 45 -μm screen following the method proposed in Tada et al. (2015). Once the undissolved residue was washed, we <b>mounted</b> <b>slides</b> following the procedures proposed by Itaki et al. (2009). Then, we examined polycystine radiolarians under an optical microscope at magnifications of ×[*] 100 to ×[*] 400 on both types of slide. All radiolarians were identified and counted until at least 400 individual tests were identified in each sample, or until the sample material was exhausted (see the Additional file 1). The identification followed the nomenclature of Itaki (2009), Matsuzaki et al. (2015 a), and Zhang and Suzuki (2017). On average, we counted 435 specimens per slide.|$|E
