5|$|To reach {{all points}} {{designated}} by the Admiralty for longitude measurements, it was sometimes necessary to take chronometers ashore, across inlets and up rivers too shallow for the ship. This put the chronometers at risk and the disturbance of moving them affected their accuracy. This was another reason for survey ships to carry a large number â€“ most {{of them could be}} kept permanently in a safe, well-cushioned place on the <b>main</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{function}} of the vacuum vessel {{is to provide a}} hermetically sealed plasma container. Its main components are the <b>main</b> <b>vessel,</b> the port structures and the supporting system. The <b>main</b> <b>vessel</b> is a double walled structure with poloidal and toroidal stiffening ribs between [...] shells to reinforce the vessel structure. These ribs also form the flow passages for the cooling water. The space between the double walls will be filled with shield structures made of stainless steel. The inner surfaces of the vessel will act as the interface with breeder modules containing the breeder blanket component. These modules will provide shielding from the high-energy neutrons produced by the fusion reactions and some will also be used for tritium breeding concepts.|$|E
2500|$|Heraldic {{decoration}} {{with the}} {{coat of arms}} of the owner was very common. This could be engraved, or on small cast pieces attached to the <b>main</b> <b>vessel</b> by bolts. This method {{made it easier to}} change the heraldry if a service changed hands to a different family, and is used on the Lennoxlove and other services. [...] It is clear that many services were mainly made up from standard designs, perhaps often available from a silversmith's stock, and often built up taking some individual pieces from other silversmiths working with the same designs. [...] Moulds were also lent between workshops. In the 18th century pattern books became important, initially mostly French, but later originating in England and other countries; these supplemented earlier drawings and individual prints. [...] The sophisticated and complicated designs of the Rococo accelerated this process.|$|E

60|$|Section 46. The {{distribution}} of the veins of the rabbit has only a superficial parallelism with arteries. The chief factors of vena cava inferior are the hepatic vein (h.v.), which receives the liver blood, the renal veins (r.v.), from the kidneys, the ilaeo-lumbar, from the abdominal wall, and the external (e.il.v.) and internal ilias (i.il.v.); {{with the exception of}} the renal veins none of these run side by side with arteries. The superior cavae (r. and l.v.c.s.) are formed by the union of internal (i.j.) and external jugular (e.j.) veins with a subclavian (s.cl.v.) from the fore limb. The term pre-caval vein is sometimes used for superior cava. The attention, of the student is called to the small azygos vein (az.) running into the right vena cava superior, and forming the only asymmetrical (not-balancing) feature of the veins in front of the heart; it brings blood back from the ribs of the thorax wall, and is of interest mainly because it answers to an enormous <b>main</b> <b>vessel,</b> the right post-cardinal sinus, in fishes. There are spermatic arteries and veins (s.v. and a.) to the genital organs. All these vessels should be patiently dissected out by the student, and drawn.|$|E
50|$|In EVH, {{clinical}} experience, comprehensive {{training and}} a careful approach are needed when cutting and removing side branches from the <b>main</b> <b>vessel</b> being harvested. As branches are cut, {{they must be}} sealed, or cauterized, to prevent bleeding after disconnection from the <b>main</b> <b>vessel.</b> In surgical practice {{it is common to}} use a form of heat or electrical energy to cauterize, or seal tissues in order to stop bleeding. If not properly controlled, the application of heat or energy to seal off the branch vessels can cause unintended thermal injury to the surrounding cells including the endothelium of the <b>main</b> <b>vessel</b> or conduit.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{treatments}} of liver cancer is resection or ablation {{of one or}} several tumour and of an area of healthy tissue around it.

The objective is to find the number of tumours, their size and the physical and spatial relationship between the tumours and the <b>main</b> blood <b>vessels.</b> The extraction of the essential information from the images is a time-consuming procedure, as the radiologist must trace the contour of the liver manually as well as the tumour and the <b>main</b> <b>vessels.</b> In addition one problem is that blood vessels and liver tissue show similar contrast on the CT scans.
