25|$|Local anesthetics {{are broken}} down into 2 categories: ester-linked and amide-linked drugs. The esters include benzocaine, procaine, tetracaine, and chloroprocaine. The amides include {{lidocaine}}, <b>mepivacaine,</b> prilocaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine. Chloroprocaine is a short-acting drug (45–90 minutes), lidocaine and <b>mepivacaine</b> are intermediate duration (90–180 minutes), and bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine are long-acting (4–18 hours). Drugs commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks include lidocaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine, and <b>mepivacaine.</b> These drugs are often combined with adjuvants (additives) with the end goal of increasing {{the duration of the}} analgesia or shortening time of onset. Additives may include epinephrine, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine. Vasoconstriction caused by local anesthetic may be further enhanced synergistically with the addition of epinephrine, the most widely used additive. Epinephrine increases the length of analgesic duration and decreases blood flow by acting as an agonist at the α1-adrenoceptor. Dexmedetomidine is not as widely used as epinephrine. Studies in humans indicate improved onset time and increased duration of analgesia.|$|E
25|$|The lumbar plexus {{block is}} an {{advanced}} technique indicated for hip, anterior thigh, and knee surgery. The lumbar plexus {{is composed of}} nerves originating from L1 to L4 spinal roots such as the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, femoral, and obturator nerves. Since the plexus is located deep, there is {{an increased risk of}} local anesthetic toxicity, so less toxic anesthetics like chloroprocaine or <b>mepivacaine</b> mixed with ropivacaine are often recommended. A curvilinear ultrasound probe can be used but {{it is often difficult to}} see the plexus, so a nerve stimulator is used to locate it.|$|E

50|$|PEP {{is used as}} an {{intramuscular}} injection for estrogen therapy of prostate cancer.

50|$|Sufentanil is marketed {{for use by}} {{specialist}} centers {{under different}} trade names, such as Sufenta and Sufentil. Sufentanil with and without lidocaine or <b>mepivacaine</b> is available as a transdermal patch similar to Duragesic in Europe under trade names such as Chronogesic.|$|E
50|$|Choice of agentsA person {{receiving}} an epidural for pain relief may receive local anaesthetic, an opioid, or both. Common local anaesthetics include lidocaine, <b>mepivacaine,</b> bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and chloroprocaine. Common opioids include hydromorphone, morphine, fentanyl, sufentanil, and pethidine (known as meperidine in the United States). These are injected in relatively small doses, compared {{to when they}} are injected intravenously. Other agents such as clonidine or ketamine are also sometimes used.|$|E
50|$|Like lidocaine, {{bupivacaine}} is an amino-amide anesthetic; the aromatic {{head and}} the hydrocarbon chain are linked by an amide bond rather than an ester as in earlier local anesthetics. As a result, the amino-amide anesthetics are more stable {{and less likely to}} cause allergic reactions. Unlike lidocaine, the terminal amino portion of bupivacaine (as well as <b>mepivacaine,</b> ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine) is contained within a piperidine ring; these agents are known as pipecholyl xylidines.|$|E
50|$|Amide {{local anesthetics}} (e.g., lidocaine, prilocaine, bupivicaine, levobupivacaine, ropivacaine, <b>mepivacaine,</b> dibucaine and etidocaine) are {{generally}} heat-stable, {{with a long}} shelf life (around 2 years). They have a slower onset and longer half-life than ester anesthetics, and are usually racemic mixtures, {{with the exception of}} levobupivacaine (which is S(-) -bupivacaine) and ropivacaine (S(-)-ropivacaine). These agents are generally used within regional and epidural or spinal techniques, due to their longer duration of action, which provides adequate analgesia for surgery, labor, and symptomatic relief.|$|E
50|$|The {{duration}} of the anesthetic varies depending on the substance used. Lidocaine is especially short acting, and is therefore usually not used for lameness evaluations. The longer-acting anesthetic <b>mepivacaine</b> is most-commonly used for nerve blocks, because ideally the block should last throughout the lameness exam to avoid false positives with subsequent blocks as they are performed up the leg. Bupivicaine is very long-lasting (up to 4-6 hours), and is most commonly used for analgesia following surgery rather than for nerve blocks.|$|E
5000|$|Procaine is used less {{frequently}} today since more effective (and hypoallergenic) alternatives such as lidocaine (Xylocaine) exist. Like other local anesthetics (such as <b>mepivacaine,</b> and prilocaine), procaine is a vasodilator, thus is often coadministered with epinephrine {{for the purpose}} of vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction helps to reduce bleeding, increases the duration and quality of anesthesia, prevents the drug from reaching systemic circulation in large amounts, and overall reduces the amount of anesthetic required. Unlike cocaine, a vasoconstrictor, procaine does not have the euphoric and addictive qualities that put it at risk for abuse.|$|E
50|$|The lumbar plexus {{block is}} an {{advanced}} technique indicated for hip, anterior thigh, and knee surgery. The lumbar plexus {{is composed of}} nerves originating from L1 to L4 spinal roots such as the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, femoral, and obturator nerves. Since the plexus is located deep, there is {{an increased risk of}} local anesthetic toxicity, so less toxic anesthetics like chloroprocaine or <b>mepivacaine</b> mixed with ropivacaine are often recommended. A curvilinear ultrasound probe can be used but {{it is often difficult to}} see the plexus, so a nerve stimulator is used to locate it.|$|E
50|$|A local {{anesthetic}} is a {{drug that}} causes reversible local anesthesia {{and a loss of}} nociception. When it is used on specific nerve pathways (nerve block), effects such as analgesia (loss of pain sensation) and paralysis (loss of muscle power) can be achieved. Clinical local anesthetics belong to one of two classes: aminoamide and aminoester local anesthetics. Synthetic local anesthetics are structurally related to cocaine. They differ from cocaine mainly in that they have no abuse potential and do not act on the sympathoadrenergic system, i.e. they do not produce hypertension or local vasoconstriction, with the exception of Ropivacaine and <b>Mepivacaine</b> that do produce weak vasoconstriction.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used local anesthetic is lidocaine (also called xylocaine or lignocaine), a modern replacement for procaine (also known as novocaine). Its half-life in the body is about 1.5-2 hours. Other local anesthetic agents in current use include articaine (also called septocaine or ubistesin), bupivacaine (a long-acting anesthetic), and <b>mepivacaine.</b> A combination of these may be used depending on the situation. Also, most agents come in two forms: with and without epinephrine (adrenaline) or other vasoconstrictor that allow the agent to last longer and also controls bleeding in the tissue during procedures. Usually the case is classified using the ASA Physical Status Classification System before any anesthesia is given.|$|E

5000|$|Local {{and general}} {{anesthetic}} in surgery and dentistry, in particular those containing epinephrine. There is no universally taught or accepted practice regarding dentistry {{and use of}} MAOIs such as phenelzine, and therefore {{it is vital to}} inform all clinicians, especially dentists, of the potential effect of MAOIs and local anesthesia. In preparation for dental work, withdrawal from phenelzine is specifically advised, however since this takes two weeks it is not always a desirable or practical option. Dentists using local anesthesia are advised to use a non-epinephrine anesthetic such as <b>mepivacaine</b> at a level of 3%. Specific attention should be paid to blood pressure during the procedure, and the level of the anesthetic should be regularly and appropriately topped-up, for non-epinephrine anesthetics take longer to come into effect and wear off faster. Patients taking phenelzine are advised to notify their psychiatrist prior to any dental treatment.|$|E
40|$|Aims: A {{crossover}} double-blind, randomized {{study was}} designed to explore the efficacy of 2 % <b>mepivacaine</b> with 1 : 100, 000 adrenaline buccal infiltration and 4 % articaine with 1 : 100, 000 adrenaline buccal infiltration following 2 % <b>mepivacaine</b> with 1 : 100, 000 adrenaline inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) for testing pulp anesthesia of mandibular first molar teeth in adult volunteers. Materials and Methods: A total of 23 healthy adult volunteers received two regimens with at least 1 -week apart; one with 4 % articaine buccal infiltration and 2 % <b>mepivacaine</b> IANB (articaine regimen) and another with 2 % <b>mepivacaine</b> buccal infiltration supplemented to 2 % <b>mepivacaine</b> IANB (<b>mepivacaine</b> regimen). Pulp testing of first molar tooth was electronically measured twice at baseline, then at intervals of 2 min for the first 10 min, then every 5 min until 45 min postinjection. Anesthetic success was considered when two consecutive maximal stimulation on pulp testing readings without sensation were obtained within 10 min and continuously sustained for 45 min postinjection. Results: In total, the number of no sensations to maximum pulp testing for first molar teeth were significantly higher after articaine regimen than <b>mepivacaine</b> during 45 min postinjection (267 vs. 250 episodes, respectively, P 0. 05). Interestingly, volunteers in the articaine regimen provided faster onset and longer duration (means 2. 78 min, 42. 22 min, respectively) than <b>mepivacaine</b> regimen (means 4. 26 min, 40. 74 min, respectively) for first molar pulp anesthesia (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: Supplementary <b>mepivacaine</b> and articaine buccal infiltrations produced similar successful first molar pulp anesthesia following <b>mepivacaine</b> IANB injections in volunteers.

The neonatal umbilical vein con-centration was 0. 84 (/g/ml. The other group (30 patients: 2 % <b>mepivacaine)</b> received a mean total dose of 776 mg (11. 65 mg/kg) per patient, and developed a mean blood con-centration of <b>mepivacaine</b> at delivery of 3. 47 fi-g/ml. The neonatal umbilical vein con-centration was 2. 61 [ig/ml.

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Controversy exists about {{the specificity of}} diagnostic analgesia of the digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS) in horses. Objectives: To evaluate the degree of diffusion of <b>mepivacaine</b> from the equine DFTS to adjacent synovial structures. Study design: Crossover experiment. Methods: Under general anaesthesia, the DFTS of one front and one hindlimb of 8 horses were injected simultaneously with <b>mepivacaine.</b> Synovial fluid samples of the injected DFTS, the adjacent metacarpo-/metatarsophalangeal (MCP/MTP) joint, proximal interphalangeal joint, distal interphalangeal joint, navicular bursa and contralateral MCP/MTP joint were collected 15 min post injection (T 15) {{from one of the}} injected limbs and 60 min post injection (T 60) from the other limb. Venous blood samples were obtained at T 0, T 15 and T 60 to evaluate systemic distribution of <b>mepivacaine.</b> After a 2 -week washout period, the procedure was repeated using the same limbs but reversing the time of sampling (front vs. hindlimbs). The concentration of <b>mepivacaine</b> in samples was measured with a commercial ELISA kit. Results: <b>Mepivacaine</b> concentrations in the DFTS samples, at both T 15 (5077 mg/l) and T 60 (3503 mg/l), exceeded those estimated sufficient to produce synovial analgesia (100 mg/l or 300 mg/l). <b>Mepivacaine</b> was found in all synovial structures adjacent to the injected DFTS and in the contralateral MCP/MTP joints, but concentrations were low, with a maximum value of only 3. 2 mg/l. With the exception of the navicular bursa samples, the <b>mepivacaine</b> concentrations in the adjacent synovial structures were significantly higher at T 60 than at T 15 (P< 0. 03). Significantly higher <b>mepivacaine</b> concentrations were found in the ipsilateral than the contralateral MCP/MTP joints at T 60 (P< 0. 001). Blood samples had significantly higher <b>mepivacaine</b> concentrations at T 15 and T 60 than at T 0 (P< 0. 001). Conclusions: <b>Mepivacaine</b> injected into the DFTS of horses diffuses towards adjacent synovial structures without achieving clinically relevant concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} {{and compare the}} onset and duration of action of 2 local anesthetics based on objective lameness and skin sensitivity assessment. Study design: Interventional crossover experimental trial with balanced randomization. Animals: Eight horses. Methods: Reversible forelimb lameness was induced in 8 horses. A palmar digital nerve block (PDNB) was applied with <b>mepivacaine</b> or lidocaine (both 2 %). Quantitative lameness and skin sensitivity data were collected with an inertial sensor system and a force gauge, respectively. The times to lameness resolution/skin desensitization (T 1), consistent lameness detection/partial return of skin sensitivity (T 2), and complete return of lameness/skin sensitivity (T 3) were determined and compared between treatments and assessment methods. Results: <b>Mepivacaine</b> blocks resolved lameness in 8 / 8 horses, compared to 3 / 8 horses with lidocaine blocks. Both agents led to skin desensitization in 8 / 8 horses. Skin desensitization occurred sooner than lameness resolution after <b>mepivacaine</b> (P =. 047). Duration of action was longer with <b>mepivacaine</b> than lidocaine (mean T 3 _lameness <b>mepivacaine</b> 366 minutes, lidocaine 113 minutes (P =. 038); T 3 _skin <b>mepivacaine</b> 195 minutes, lidocaine 63 minutes [P ≤. 001]). Skin sensitivity returned sooner than lameness after lidocaine block at T 3 (P =. 015). Conclusion: The use of lidocaine in PDNBs {{for the purpose of}} lameness diagnosis should be reassessed, as it may not resolve lameness despite loss of skin sensation. <b>Mepivacaine</b> is superior, with a reliable onset and longer duration of action. Skin desensitization as an indicator for the onset of action or effectiveness of PDNBs for <b>mepivacaine</b> and lidocaine, or as a measure of the duration of action of lidocaine PDNBs should be interpreted with caution...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the speed of}} action and injection discomfort of 4 % articaine and 2 % <b>mepivacaine</b> for upper teeth extractions. Materials and Methods: Forty-five patients {{were included in the}} articaine 4 % group, and 45 in the <b>mepivacaine</b> 2 % control group. After all injections, soft and hard tissue numbness was objectively gauged by dental probe at intervals of 15 s. Furthermore, the discomfort of the injections were recorded by the patients after each treatment on standard 100 mm visual analog scales, tagged at the endpoints with “no pain” (0 mm) and “unbearable pain” (100 mm). Results: There were significant differences in the meantime of first numbness to associated palatal mucosa and tooth of patients between <b>mepivacaine</b> and articaine buccal infiltration (BI) groups P = 0. 01 and 0. 01. Patients in the articaine group recorded earlier palatal mucosa and teeth numbness than those in the <b>mepivacaine</b> group. With regards to the discomfort of the needle injections, palatal injection was significantly more painful than BI (t-test: P< 0. 001). Articaine buccal injection was significantly more painful than <b>mepivacaine</b> buccal injection (t-test: P< 0. 001). However, articaine palatal injection was less painful than articaine BI. Clinically, anesthesia onset time was faster in anterior upper teeth than upper middle and posterior teeth. Conclusions: BIs with 4 % articaine was faster in achieving palate and teeth anesthesia than 2 % <b>mepivacaine</b> for extraction of upper maxillary teeth.
