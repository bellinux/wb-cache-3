AWJ is the high-speed water jet containing solid particles and is used for cutting of various industrial materials.

Phase velocity distribution in the axial direction of jet was also estimated {{based on the measured}} pressure distribution in the AWJ nozzle with the aid of the continuous and the momentum equations. The result shows that the decrease of the liquid phase velocity in the <b>mixing</b> <b>nozzle</b> is small {{in the case of the}} gas liquid two phase flow, and the velocity of liquid phase is remarkably reduced on the contrary in the gas liquid-solid three-phase flow. In the latter case, the total momentum of jet is reduced comparing with two phase flow.

The impact of choice of graph on the optimization process is examined using four different graphs: cycle, hypercube, toroid, and Peterson. Conclusions about the general type of nozzles designed by each graph type are included {{in order to identify}} the design strengths associated with each graph. This work provides insight into the considerations required to obtain more desirable performance from a <b>mixing</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Characteristics that influence jet distance and trajectory are reviewed. Some of these characteristics include the shape and size of horn used to guide the jet and the open entrainment area between the horn and the jet. The relative importance of each of these traits and which traits have the most significant impact on the quality of a given design are also explored. Suggestions for nozzle design are summarized. This information allows the most limiting factors of a tank mixing design to be mitigated to the largest extent possible.;This work illustrates that using magnification ratio or velocity alone does not result in an optimized design. These factors must be weighted to obtain a design that balances these factors for the geometry of fluid volume to be mixed. Additionally, this work shows that nozzle placement is perhaps more significant than nozzle design for optimum mixing with minimum power consumption...|$|E

50|$|External <b>mix</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{contacts}} fluids {{outside the}} nozzle {{as shown in}} the schematic diagram. This type of spray nozzle may require more atomizing air and a higher atomizing air pressure drop because the mixing and atomization of liquid takes place outside the nozzle. The liquid pressure drop is lower for this type of nozzle, sometimes drawing liquid into the nozzle due to the suction caused by the atomizing air nozzles (siphon nozzle). If the liquid to be atomized contains solids an external mix atomizer may be preferred. This spray may be shaped to produce different spray patterns. A flat pattern is formed with additional air ports to flatten or reshape the circular spray cross-section discharge.|$|R

This research aims to study the effect of injector nozzle geometry on mixture and internal combustion efficiency in four stroke automotive engine which operates using hydrogen fuel. The research will concentrate on two aspects, namely the inflow and outflow profile of the injector nozzle. For each flow profile, the effect of geometrical design of the nozzle on the parameter such as flow velocity, fuel penetration distance, average mass fuel consumption and diffusion will be studied in detail. In this study, numerical simulation analysis was done by using the computing fluid dynamics (CFD) software, Star-CCM+. Models comprise of multiple orifice nozzle geometry with single angle orifice and double angle orifice was developed with CAD software.

Previous attempts to create biomimetic systems have often used single materials shaped into limited configurations that do not mimic the heterogeneous structure and properties of many biological tissues. The identification of new bio-inspired materials alongside the development of appropriate fabrication techniques is the key to overcoming the challenge of replicating the functional gradients of these heterogeneous tissues.

The composite materials were characterized mechanically and their performance could be modeled with standard composite theory.

The noise of such propulsion systems is also dominated by jet noise, making the study and noise reduction of these exhaust systems very important, both for military aircraft and future civilian supersonic aircraft. This paper presents particle image velocimetry of internally <b>mixed</b> <b>nozzle</b> with different area ratios between core and bypass, and nozzles that are ideally expanded and convergent. Such configurations independently control the geometry of the internal mixing layer and of the external shock structure. These allow exploration of the impact of shocks on the turbulent mixing layers, the impact of bypass ratio on broadband shock noise and mixing noise, and the impact of temperature on the turbulent flow field. At the 2009 AIAA/CEAS Aeroacoustics Conference the authors presented data and analysis from a series of tests that looked at the acoustics of supersonic jets from internally <b>mixed</b> <b>nozzles.</b> In that paper the broadband shock and mixing noise components of the jet noise were independently manipulated by holding Mach number constant while varying bypass ratio and jet temperature. Significant portions of that analysis was predicated on assumptions regarding the flow fields of these jets, both shock structure and turbulence.

In addition, the turbulent velocity data documented here will be very useful for validation of computational flow codes that are being developed to design advanced nozzles for future aircraft...|$|R
50|$|Consider a mixed {{turbofan}} with a fixed {{bypass ratio}} and airflow. Increasing the overall pressure {{ratio of the}} compression system raises the combustor entry temperature.

Although the higher temperature rise across the compression system implies a larger temperature drop over the turbine system, the <b>mixed</b> <b>nozzle</b> temperature is unaffected, because the same amount of heat is being added to the system. There is, however, a rise in nozzle pressure, because overall pressure ratio increases faster than the turbine expansion ratio, causing an increase in the hot mixer entry pressure.

The exploratory capabilities of the designer could be enhanced by creating an interactive virtual engineering framework. This research presents progressive interaction with the designer-in-the-loop whose intelligence is blended with the computational power to suitably control the optimization. Progressive interaction is a human-guided preference articulation method where the designer intelligence continuously controls the engineering analysis and optimization by visualization, modification and controlled re-optimization. Based on the designer 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge and the knowledge available from the interaction system, the designer preferences can be modified anytime to expedite optimization. Progressive interaction not only helps the designer discover the hidden relationship between the decision variables but it also uncovers the implicit constraints and other performance limitations of the design.

The rapid cure systems initially develop a shear elastic modulus at a faster rate which suddenly decreases at approximately the same time that the temperature of the adhesive reaches its maximum value during the exothermic reaction. This is consistent with an initial rapid reaction rate which is then greatly reduced as the remaining un-reacted polymer chains require a finite time to move into a position where they can react and join the network...|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Production of finely-dispersed crystalline propellants, explosives and/or oxidants involves contacting a solvent solution of the material in a nozzle with an anti-solvent which is at least partially miscible with the solution solvent and in which the material is non- or only slightly-soluble so as to precipitate the material as fine crystals which are then separated from the solvent and/or antisolvent, the solution being introduced {{in at least one}} channel (2) of a multi- component <b>mixing</b> <b>nozzle</b> (1 a, 1 b) and the anti-solvent being introduced in a second channel (3) which is at a finite angle (alpha) to channel (2) while the precipitated crystals, together with the solvent and anti-solvent, are removed via a third channel (4) formed by the intersection of channels (2) and (3), the novel feature being that the particle size of the crystals thus obtained is adjusted by varying the angle (alpha).

40|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{applications}} that require the use of nanoengineered surfaces for separation applications. Surfaces are commonly functionalized in order to facilitate the purification of gases and liquids. Functionalization often requires the application of a polymer to the surface. The most common means is to dissolve the polymer in a solvent and then either cast or spray it onto the surface. This traditional approach causes two severe limitations: (1) the polymer must be soluble; (2) the solvent must be removed from the final coating. The first limitation often eliminates many potential candidate polymers. The second limitation is influential on the transport and separation properties of the coating. Low levels of residual solvents can significantly degrade the ability of the coating to perform the separation process. These two issues can be overcome through the use of ''Solvent-Less vapor deposition followed by In-situ Polymerization'' (SLIP). The SLIP process was originally developed for the fabrication of Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) targets. This application required the deposition of films of 100 to 200 microns in thickness onto a spherical substrate. The process consists of two evaporation chambers each containing a quantity of monomer. The precursors, monomers, are vaporized and flow though a <b>mixing</b> <b>nozzle</b> and eventually are deposited on a substrate surface. They react at the surface and form a nanoengineered polymer film. The SLIP process has been utilized to develop composite membranes for gas and liquid separation applications.

The SLIP process {{has been shown to be}} robust and current plans are in place to scale-up the process. This scale-up would enable the coating of flat sheets and fibers.

Given that hot flows are of most practical interest, optical techniques such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) are applicable. When the flow has strong azimuthal features, such as those generated by chevrons or lobed mixers, traditional PIV, which aligns the measurement plane parallel to the dominant flow direction is very inefficient, requiring many planes of data to be acquired and stacked up to produce the desired flow cross-sections.

40|$|A {{broad range}} of {{commercial}} and experimental grades of ceramics and ceramic composites was tested in various model tests and simplified component tests. The tests were done to establish important microstructural features, friction and wear mechanisms. Important tribological systems used in the tests included face seals, abrasive-waterjet nozzles and hybrid bearings. The importance of mechanical and physical properties at the micro-level has been highlighted in the work, as they play vital roles in the tribology of ceramics and are less commonly investigated than the bulk properties. Novel ceramic whisker composites were produced by hot-isostatic-pressing. The composites {{were based on a}} silicon nitride matrix reinforced with silicon carbide whiskers. The matrix of silicon nitride showed high strength and fracture toughness. But the composites showed no improvements in the bulk mechanical properties when compared with the matrix. This was mainly due to impurities in the whisker batch, causing defects and lower fracture toughness. A new type of silicon carbide material was made dense using liquid-phase sintering, and its wear behaviour was established and compared with conventionally solid-state sintered silicon carbides. The presence of grain boundary phases was both an advantage and a disadvantage regarding wear rates. At high wear rates the grain boundary phase limits the severity, probably due to crack deflection of the micro-fractures that occur. However, in mild wear the limited high-temperature properties of the grain boundary phases can be a disadvantage. Monolithic ceramics and composites with similar mechanical and physical properties to the bulk showed dramatically different wear behaviour in the tests. A newly developed, more homogeneous grade of whisker reinforced alumina showed superior wear resistance to the other monolithic ceramics and composites that were considered. A high-speed abrasive-waterjet test was developed in the work for wear testing, and was used to investigate the resistance of ceramics to thermal wear. The wear was caused by thermal spalling, oxidation, creep and plastic deformation. Abrasive-waterjet tests were done at low inclination angles, and newly commercialized machines were used. The tests highlighted the influence of thermal wear in the <b>mixing</b> <b>nozzle</b> for the abrasive and the waterjet, and the thermal mechanisms present while machining engineering ceramics. It was previously not known that an abrasive waterjet creates a thermal zone when machining ceramics at the wear front and in the mixing nozzles. The temperatures reached in the wear zone of the test specimens were at least 1280 ° C for the garnet abrasive, and 2050 ° C for the alumina abrasive. In scratch testing with diamond tips the presence of four different wear regimes was established for ceramics. On the tested materials a transition was seen from entirely ductile deformation at low loads, towards catastrophic brittle fractures at high loads. In scratch testing some materials, such as a hot-isostatic-pressed silicon nitride composite, showed much higher resistance to the initiation of brittle fracture. Ceramic composites reinforced with long fibres were studied to rank their sensitivity to particle impact. The test showed that composites with silicon carbide spheres on the surface were more resistant to the impact of abrasive particles. The spheres were present from the manufacturing process (chemical vapour infiltration). A study of thrust bearings was performed to compare all-steel bearings with hybrid ones. The hybrid bearing was of the same type as the all-steel one except the balls were of silicon nitride. The influence of contaminants in the bearings was investigated for fairly soft micron-sized (0. 1 - 5. my. m titania) and macro-sized (75 100. my. m quartz) ceramic contaminants. The hybrid bearing showed greatly superior performance when contaminants were present compared to the traditional all-steel type of bearing. It was shown that it is even possible to reduce friction and wear in a hybrid bearing system by the introduction of micron-sized titania particles...|$|E

First, exploratory {{work on the}} use of passive mixing enhancement devices, namely chevrons and tabs, in IR signature reduction for external turbofan plumes is demonstrated numerically and experimentally. Such small attachments, when properly designed, cause an otherwise axisymmetric plume to have significant 3 D structures, affecting signature prediction. Second, an approach for including non-axisymmetric and installation effects in plume signature prediction is discussed using unstructured methodology. Unstructured flow solvers, using advanced turbulence modeling and plume thermochemistry, facilitate the modeling of aircraft effects on plume structure that previously have been neglected due to gridding complexities. The capabilities of the CRUNCH unstructured Navier-Stokes solver for plume modeling is demonstrated for a passively <b>mixed</b> turbofan <b>nozzle,</b> a generic fighter nozzle, and a complete aircraft...|$|R
