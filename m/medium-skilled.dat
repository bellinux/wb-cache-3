5000|$|Using the US Census Bureau's {{definition}} of poverty, the working poverty rate {{seems to have}} remained relatively stable since 1978. [...] However, many scholars {{have argued that the}} official poverty threshold is too low, and that real wages and working conditions have actually declined for many workers over the past three or four decades. Social scientists like Arne Kalleberg have found that the decline in US manufacturing and the subsequent polarization of the labor market has led to an overall worsening of wages, job stability, and working conditions for people with lower skill levels and less formal education. From the mid-1940s to the mid-1970s, manufacturing jobs offered many low-skilled and <b>medium-skilled</b> workers stable, well-paying jobs. Due to global competition, technological advances, and other factors, US manufacturing jobs have been disappearing for decades. (From 1970 to 2008, the percentage of the labor force employed in the manufacturing sector shrank from 23.4% to 9.1%.) During this period of decline, job growth became polarized on either end of the labor market. That is, the jobs that replaced medium-pay, low- to medium-skill manufacturing jobs were high-paying, high-skill jobs and low-paying, low-skill jobs. Therefore, many low- to <b>medium-skilled</b> workers who {{would have been able to}} work in the manufacturing sector in 1970 must now take low-paying, precarious jobs in the service sector.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the skill composition of migration flows on the host country’s labour market in a specific-factors-two-sector model with heterogeneous labour (low-, medium-, and high-skilled). We assume price-setting behavior in both manufacturing and services sectors. The low- and <b>medium-skilled</b> labour markets are characterized by frictions due to wage bargaining. Moreover, we assume bumping down of unemployed <b>medium-skilled</b> workers into low-skilled service jobs whereas endogenous benefits create an interdependency between the two bargaining processes. Particular attention is paid to <b>medium-skilled</b> migration which enables us to augment the literature by replicating important stylized facts regarding medium skills, such as i) the interaction between immigration, low-skilled unemployment and <b>medium-skilled</b> over-qualification, ii) the polarization effect where both low and high-skilled wages increase relative to the <b>medium-skilled.</b> The model is calibrated using German data. The key findings are: (i) a perfectly balanced migration has a neutral impact on the receiving economy due to international capital flows; (ii) immigration of <b>medium-skilled</b> labour together with some high-skilled labour lowers the low-skilled unemployment rate and has a positive effect on output per capita; (iii) migration of only <b>medium-skilled</b> labour has a neutral GDP per capita effect. ...|$|E

30|$|Summarizing the {{empirical}} picture {{obtained from the}} indicators clearly indicates that there was a turning point {{of the labor market}} chances of young job market entrants around the year 2000 : highly-educated workers have faced declining employment opportunities in top-paying jobs and, partly, in analytical jobs after 2000. Real entry wages have fallen for each new entry cohort since then {{until the end of the}} observation period. Moreover, wage growth after five years has substantially declined for cohorts entering the labor market in this period in Germany, too. In particular <b>medium-skilled</b> and higher-skilled labor market entrants have been affected by this development. Whereas the share of young high-skilled workers performing analytical jobs has declined only slightly after the tech bust (similar to the U.S.), our results indicate a general decline of wages for young workers. Falling wages are more profound for <b>medium-skilled</b> and low-skilled workers than for high-skilled workers. Wage premia for higher education slightly rose relative to <b>medium-skilled</b> and low-skilled workers. Moreover, the displacement effects, shrinking wages, and flattening wage growth for <b>medium-skilled</b> and low-skilled workers further signify the impacts of the increase in graduation rates in higher education.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} impact of high-skilled labor on the {{unemployment}} and wages of low- and <b>medium-skilled</b> workers in the Netherlands. Using annual panel data from the Netherlands’ Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (National Bureau of Statistics, CBS), a statistically significant negative impact {{of an increase in}} high-skilled labor on the livelihoods of low- and <b>medium-skilled</b> workers can be shown. An increase in high-skilled labor is associated with a significant decrease in the income share of the bottom tenth percentile of the population as well as a decrease in jobs for the low- and <b>medium-skilled</b> workers. The data reveals a significant negative effect on the bottom 60 percent of earners and a disproportionate increase in the earnings share of the top 30 percent. This development can be explained by job market dynamics. Every high-skilled worker that enters the labor market displaces medium- and low-skilled workers into lower paid positions...|$|E
30|$|We {{continue}} {{by showing}} {{the share of}} employed nationals by occupational skill level of the employed population by nationality. We categorized employed individuals’ occupations into low-skilled, <b>medium-skilled</b> and high-skilled following the OECD (2007) classification. Using the International Standard Classification of Occupations at the one digit level (ISCO 88), low-skilled occupations are elementary occupations (category 9), <b>medium-skilled</b> occupations are clerks, service workers, skilled agricultural and fishery workers, craft workers, plant and machine operators (category 4 – 8), and high-skilled occupations are legislators, technicians and professionals (category 1 – 3).|$|E
30|$|One of {{the most}} {{attractive}} features of this model {{is that it can}} be used to investigate the implications of technological changes on worker displacement from previously performed tasks. In particular, routine tasks, which are mostly performed by <b>medium-skilled</b> workers, are those most subject to machine displacement, and therefore task-replacing technological changes can directly reduce wages of the <b>medium-skilled</b> group independent of changes in total output. As these workers lose comparative advantage in routine-intensive activities, they must be reallocated either to the highest or the lowest tails of the occupational distribution, leading to employment polarization.|$|E
30|$|When task {{groups are}} {{considered}} in the estimation, they reduce the absolute level and the relative increase of the estimated wage premia of high-skilled workers. Despite this level effect, the relative increase of wage premia has followed a similar pattern. For high-skilled workers, wage premia have increased after the mid- 1990 s, but the rise has been smaller in size. However, {{the increase in the}} wage premium of <b>medium-skilled</b> workers relative to low-skilled workers has halved when taking the effects of tasks into account. Both panels show the increase in wage premia relative to low-skilled and <b>medium-skilled</b> workers. Figs.  4 and  5 above revealed already a decline of starting wages for low-skilled workers. The increase in wage premia of high-skilled workers may thus further imply a relative fall of demand and of wages for low-skilled workers. With respect to the timing, {{it should be noted that}} most of the increase of the wage premia has occurred after the mid- 1990 s. From the beginning of the 2000 s, however, real wages of high-skilled labor market entrants have fallen, but not as strong as those of low-skilled and <b>medium-skilled</b> workers.|$|E
30|$|By {{level of}} skill, labor compensations tend to {{concentrate}} in compensations to <b>medium-skilled</b> labor.

40|$|We {{forecast}} {{the number of}} qualified workers required in the German federal state Thuringia until 2015 {{on the basis of}} the manpower requirement approach. Disaggregated by types of qualification, this method distinguishes between two sources of recruitment requirements: replacement demand for old workers and expansion demand to reflect structural changes of industry sectors and productivity growth. Both components are calculated from register data on employment covered by social security. Relative to current employment, recruitment requirements vary across occupations. A comparison of recruitment requirements for <b>medium-skilled</b> workers with the structure of vocational training reveals potential mismatch between demand and supply of <b>medium-skilled</b> labor in the near future if the composition of apprenticeship programs remains unchanged. The study closes with policy recommendations to prevent occupational mismatch. ...|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, we {{observed}} how the typical worker {{has a higher}} relevance in some low- and <b>medium-skilled</b> occupations, whereas high-skilled occupations are more diversified in their implementation.

30|$|The {{second set}} of {{scenario}} assumes a 10 % increase in labor productivity across the board in all the sectors (simulation 2 A) and the same change but only of low-skilled and <b>medium-skilled</b> labor in the selected sectors (simulation 2 B). The increase in labor productivity is needed to increase supply efficiency in response to demand changes. These simulations also compare skill intensity in trade sectors, referring to which types of labor (low-skilled, <b>medium-skilled,</b> or high-skilled) are more demanded proportionately {{in the production of}} different goods. The demand for labor may rise or fall depending on the types of labor that are more important in the targeted sectors. Are agriculture, food, and rubber production more skilled intensive? This question can be addressed by examining what happens to labor demand when there is production disturbance.|$|E

3000|$|This cyclicality {{in wages}} and wage growth, {{promptly}} accelerating for cohorts entering {{the labor market}} in the mid- 1990 s and recapturing its former path after the millennium, still cannot completely explain the increasing wage gap between young and experienced workers (see Fig.  2 above). The cyclicality can be observed for both high-uni and high-fh-skilled workers, {{and there is no}} convergence to narrowing the wage gap between young and experienced workers in the late 1990 s. At the same time and in contrast to the higher-skilled groups, there is no clear cyclical movement for medium- and low-skilled workers: <b>medium-skilled</b> young workers had faced constant wages and wage growth in the 1990 s, which have declined after the millennium. For low-skilled workers, the corresponding fall in wages has begun already a decade earlier. Both developments are easy to reconcile with falling chances to obtain medium-paying jobs and increasing risks to get bottom-paying jobs as well as the cascading pattern across skill groups, starting by the millennium for <b>medium-skilled</b> workers and about a decade earlier for low-skilled workers. Still, the increasing wage gap between young and experienced workers is difficult to explain in light of the increasing share of high-skilled workers and the declining share of <b>medium-skilled</b> and low-skilled workers. Hence, a further possible reason for the wage gap remains in a decline of wage premia for skills, i.[*]e. lower returns to education levels over time. 9 [...]...|$|E
30|$|The {{coefficients}} on {{the cohort}} of arrival dummies also reveal an interesting result.

30|$|We {{validate}} our procedures {{by using}} external GDR census {{data provided by}} the German Statistical Office. These data allow us to compare the fraction of individuals in specific education-age group cells resulting from our imputations with those from the census data for comparable cohorts in 1984. The general picture that emerges is that IMP 2 and IMP 3 tend to overpredict the share of <b>medium-skilled</b> workers and underpredict the share of high-skilled for all age groups, whereas they underpredict (overpredict) the share of low-skilled for the younger (older) age groups. The latter is also true for IMP 1. Compared with IMP 2 and IMP 3, IMP 1 gives rise to smaller deviations for the share of <b>medium-skilled,</b> whereas it overpredicts the share of high-skilled especially for the younger age groups. Overall, when balancing out the trade off between goodness of fit and data coverage, the more narrowly defined procedure IMP 1 performs best.|$|E
30|$|The {{coefficients}} {{from the}} “years since arrival” dummies {{show how the}} immigrant-natives wage differential decreases over time. After 10 years in the country, the wage gap has narrowed by 12 percentage points for low-skilled workers and 14 percentage points for <b>medium-skilled</b> workers. While there is practically no difference in wage assimilation between low- and <b>medium-skilled</b> workers over time, high-skilled workers experience a higher wage convergence as their wage gap narrows 27 percentage points after a decade in the country. In addition, we find that full assimilation does not occur, as in Izquierdo et al. 2009, as a 12 percentage points wage differential remains for workers in jobs requiring no degree, 22 percentage points remains for workers in jobs requiring a high-school degree and 14 percentage points remain for workers in jobs requiring a college degree. After the first ten years in the country, the coefficients on the “years since migration” dummies either remain constant (for high-skilled workers) or begin to decrease (for medium- and low-skilled ones).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} wages, openness, and demand on employment in the private manufacturing industry in Turkey based on panel data {{for the period of}} 1973 – 2001. The wage elasticity of employment increases after trade liberalization. Nevertheless, output elasticity of labor demand is higher than wage elasticity in the total manufacturing sector for the whole estimation period, and in the high- and medium skilled sectors in the post- 1980 period. Trade effects, after controlling for output, seem to have a low economic significance. The positive effects of exports on the labor intensity of production are low or are offset by labor saving effects of foreign trade, particularly in the high- and <b>medium-skilled</b> sectors. On the other hand, there is some evidence of a negative import effect in the low-skilled sectors, whereas in the high- and <b>medium-skilled</b> group a complementary relation between domestic labor and imported inputs dominates the effects...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effects of}} offshoring on labour market inequalities between skill groups based on German industry level data from 1995 to 2007. Our main findings are the following: First, offshoring is on average biased in favour of high-skilled employees and in disfavour of low-skilled employees. This effect is strongly driven by the manufacturing sector, material offshoring, and offshoring to Central and Eastern Europe. Second, {{we find that the}} labour market adjusts to offshoring mainly through changes in relative wages rather than changes in relative employment. This runs counter to the classical argument that German labour market institutions (collective bargaining, unemployment benefits, etc.) lead to rigid wage structures and high unemployment rates. Third, in the service sector it is the group of <b>medium-skilled</b> employees which is particularly exposed to offshoring, possibly due to the different nature of tasks there. Fourth, <b>medium-skilled</b> employees are also negatively affected by technological change, which explains recent trends towards a polarisation in labour demand...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the changing nature}} of occupational labour-market trends in South Africa and the resulting impact on wages. We observe high levels of demand for skilled labour that have intensified a trend already established before 1994. Over the period 2001 - 12 employment within the primary sectors collapsed, employment in the manufacturing sector did not increase, while employment in the tertiary sectors such as financial services and community services grew. High- and <b>medium-skilled</b> occupations such as managers, professionals, service and sales workers have seen significant growth while the number of low-skilled workers, and the proportion of <b>medium-skilled</b> workers in the primary and secondary sectors of the economy have declined. In addition, an analysis of occupation demand using a Katz-Murphy decomposition model further shows that within-sector shifts outweigh between-sector shifts in explaining changes in relative labour demand. Increasing demand for skilled labour has also fed into and changed the structure of wages, and therefore wage inequality. We follow the work by Firpo et al. (2011) in an attempt to explore {{the way in which the}} returns to certain tasks (rather than occupations) have changed over time. This approach emphasizes the influence of structural factors such as technology and trade, in the presence of increasingly routinized tasks and offshoring, on wages. We run quantile regressions which suggest that, when controlling for age/experience, race and education, jobs which involve automated or routine tasks and those without any face-to-face component (largely lower- to <b>medium-skilled</b> jobs) have seen declining wage levels over time...|$|E
30|$|The {{baseline}} {{wage rate}} {{is set to}} 1 {{for all types of}} labor, whereas initial unemployment figures are set to 20 % for low-skilled, 15 % for <b>medium-skilled,</b> and 10 % for high-skilled labor as it is assumed that high-skilled labor finds it easier to enter the labor market and more likely to be employed. The modification in the model contributes to the originality of the study.|$|E
30|$|Among the 11, 331 {{individuals}} in the sample, the fraction exhibiting employment as the first state is 11.3 %, out of which about 19 % returned to education at some later point in time.

30|$|Second, we reveal {{heterogeneities}} in {{the evolution}} of labour market transitions: The increase in the transition rate from employment to unemployment was particularly pronounced for young persons, <b>medium-skilled</b> persons, and for men. The transition rate from unemployment to employment, on the other hand, fell more strongly for men than for women during the Great Recession. Furthermore, our results indicate that unemployment became more persistent for the high-skilled during the crisis.|$|E
30|$|During most of {{the last}} decade, newly arrived {{immigrants}} in Spain had no trouble finding jobs and quickly moved from low-skilled to <b>medium-skilled</b> jobs. The booming economy and excess demand for low-skilled workers in construction, trade, and other services sectors enabled easy integration into the labor market for most immigrants. Immigrants who arrived prior to 2008 seemed able to move quickly into employment and then from low-skilled to <b>medium-skilled</b> jobs within the first 3 to 5  years after arrival. But for many their economic situation in Spain has remained precarious. On average, one quarter of immigrants who arrived prior to the recession work in low-skilled jobs (compared to only 8 percent among natives), and the situation is worst for women and for migrants from Africa. Most immigrant workers have tended to be concentrated in construction, trade, agriculture, farming and fishing, and other services--all of which have a larger proportion of fixed-term contracts and part-time jobs. In addition, these sectors also have a prevalence of low-skilled work and, on average, shorter job tenure.|$|E
30|$|We {{have seen}} in the {{previous}} sections that the occupational distribution of EaP migrants is somewhat bimodal, with a large share being employed in low-skilled and high-skilled occupations. Given the strong worker overqualification in low- and <b>medium-skilled</b> occupations, Section 3 concluded that overqualification and non-recognition of skills seemed important obstacles to the integration of these migrants. Hence, a comparison of the occupations of natives and EaP nationals will suffer from these confounding factors.|$|E
30|$|The last {{scenario}} {{is the combination}} of the simulations 1 A, 1 B, and 2 B as the result of both the increase in demand for agro-industry and agriculture sector and the increase in productivity of low- and <b>medium-skilled</b> labor in both sectors.

30|$|Furthermore, we can {{see from}} the scatter plot in Fig.  4 that in some service sector occupations job growth was {{achieved}} at the expense of a larger share of atypical workers in the respective occupation.
