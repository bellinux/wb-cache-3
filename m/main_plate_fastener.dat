40|$|Timber {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{building}} materials of today, both in Sweden and in Europe, its uses range from single-family homes to apartment buildings and large arenas. The key reasons why timber construction continues to grow is the environmental aspects combined with the economically advantageous industrialised prefabrication process. One of the most commonly used connections in timber structures is the punched metal <b>plate</b> <b>fastener,</b> which {{is a perfect example of}} an effective connection that only can be used in a prefabrication process. It can be found in almost all kinds of buildings; from a rafter connection in small to middle sized houses up to reinforcement in heavier connections in arenas and warehouses. It is well known that the connections are the most critical parts of a structure and it is therefore crucial that these are designed for all eventualities. This project is a pilot study that seeks to evaluate the existing design methods for punched metal <b>plate</b> <b>fasteners</b> subjected to fire in Eurocode and in practice. The first conclusion is that such a method hardly exists, neither in codes nor in scientific theory, despite the fact that this is and has for decades been a very common structural detail. The theoretical analysis shows that it is very unlikely that a joint made with punched metal <b>plate</b> <b>fasteners</b> can withstand a standard fire scenario for even 15 minutes and the small-scale testing confirms this. But the project also shows that it is possible to protect the punched metal <b>plate</b> <b>fasteners</b> from fire and that it is possible to achieve up to 30 minutes resistance by installing gypsum fireboards, stone wool wood covering.

40|$|A {{coupling}} device is disclosed which is mechanically two fault tolerant for release. The device comprises a <b>fastener</b> <b>plate</b> and <b>fastener</b> body, {{each of which}} is attachable to a different one of a pair of structures to be joined. The <b>fastener</b> <b>plate</b> and body are coupled by an elongate toggle mounted at one end in a socket on the <b>fastener</b> <b>plate</b> for universal pivotal movement thereon. The other end of the toggle is received in an opening in the fastener body and adapted for limited pivotal movement therein. The toggle is adapted to be restrained by three latch hooks arranged in symmetrical equiangular spacing about the axis of the toggle, each hook being mounted on the fastener body for pivotal movement between an unlatching non-contact position with respect to the toggle and a latching position in engagement with a latching surface of the toggle. The device includes releasable lock means for locking each latch hook in its latching position whereby the toggle couples the <b>fastener</b> <b>plate</b> to the <b>fastener</b> body and means for releasing the lock means to unlock each said latch hook from the latch position whereby the unlocking of {{at least one of the}} latch hooks from its latching position results in the decoupling of the <b>fastener</b> <b>plate</b> from the <b>fastener</b> body...|$|R
40|$|A new shear {{connection}} {{system was}} tested {{in order to}} be used in off-site manufactured cassette floor elements made with glulam beams and Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) panels. The shear connection proposed is made with double-sided punched metal <b>plate</b> <b>fasteners,</b> connecting CLT and glulam members to form a T-cross-section. Due to the lack of withdrawal capacity of punched metal <b>plate</b> <b>fasteners,</b> the shear connection must be secured with screws to resist separations forces which may occur between the members in the floor element. Shear tests were performed on glulam-CLT joints made with double-sided punched metal <b>plate</b> <b>fasteners</b> and with inclined self-tapping screws as reference cases to compare to joints with both fastener types combined. Each fastener type is characterised by a specific load-slip curve and different values for the yield slip, slip at maximum load and failure slip. These parameters can be used to evaluate the compatibility of the different fasteners and their combined effect in a joint. The test results show that there is a significant contribution from both the double-sided punched metal plate and inclined screw fasteners to the strength and stiffness of the combined joints. Due {{to the fact that the}} individual fasteners reach their maximum load for different slip values, the load-carrying capacity of joints with combined fasteners is somewhat lower than the sum of the individual fasteners load-carrying capacities. The slip modulus of the combined fasteners may be estimated as the sum of the respective slip modulus of each fastener due to the compatible behaviour of the fasteners in the serviceability limit state.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a pyrotechnic actuated release mechanism which is mechanically two fault tolerant for effecting release. It is particularly {{well suited for}} releasably connecting structures {{to be used in}} the space environment or in other aerospace applications. The device comprises a <b>fastener</b> <b>plate</b> and <b>fastener</b> body, each attachable to either one of a pair of structures to be joined.

At its other end, which is received in a central opening in the fastener body and adapted for limited pivotal movement therein, the toggle is restrained by three retractable latching pins. Each pin is individually retractable by combustion of a pyrotechnic charge. While retraction of all three pins releases the toggle, the fastener is mechanically two fault tolerant since the failure of any single or pair of the latch pins to retract results in an asymmetrical loading on the toggle and its pivotal movement to effect a release.

40|$|A {{straightforward}} {{procedure to}} predict bearing strength in bolted composite structures has been developed. The method {{is based on}} a finite element analysis, using structural elements, followed by a post-processing procedure. Bolt-hole clearance, friction between member <b>plates,</b> <b>fastener</b> clamp-up and fastener deformation is accounted for. Forces calculated in the FE-analysis are converted into a local stress field which is used in an existing criterion to predict fiber microbuckling in the most critically loaded lamina. Predictions were compared with experiments which validated the method. The small computational cost required by the procedure suggests that the method is applicable on large scale structures and suitable to use in conjunction with iterative schemes such as optimization and statistical investigations.

Methods: Dietary intake data collected with a 24 -h pictorial diary in a convenience sample of 449 third- and fourth-grade schoolchildren were inspected. The weights of animal and vegetable items in each meal were calculated with respect to the food on the <b>main</b> <b>plate</b> and all elements of the meal. The percentage of animal contribution to the meal was tabulated by repast and by social group and gender and compared with the suggested limit of < 33 %. Results: Twenty-nine percent of the food depicted on <b>main</b> <b>plates</b> was of animal origin at lunch and 35 % at dinner, considering all subjects using plates; 24 % of all food consumed at the lunch meal was of animal origin, as was 28 % at dinner. Sixty-eight percent of children were concordant with the < 33 % limit on animal-origin foods served on <b>main</b> <b>plates</b> at lunch, as were 60 % with the dinner <b>main</b> <b>plates.</b> Expanding to the whole meal, concordance with the < 33 % criterion increased to 73 % at lunch and 67 % at dinner. Conclusions: In general, the habitual modes of consumption of these schoolchildren are compatible with a predominantly plant-based diet. The food consumed away from the <b>main</b> <b>plate</b> is principally of vegetal origin and needs to be accounted for in guidance for overall healthful eating. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|One of the {{important}} issues {{in the development of}} a multi-storey timber construction system is the definition of the floor solution. This thesis focuses on the development of composite floor solutions where Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) panels are used as a base element. Preliminary investigations on shear connections between prefabricated concrete beams and CLT panels were performed. The focus is on investigations on glulam-CLT composite beamelements, and the mechanical shear connectors used to achieve composite action. The new shear connections system evaluated in this thesis for glulam-CLT floor elements consists of double-sided punched metal <b>plate</b> <b>fasteners.</b> In order to secure the shear connection made with double-sided nail plates and to improve the shear behaviour of the joint, a combination with inclined self-tapping screws was evaluated through a shear test programme. It was found that the double-sided punched metal <b>plate</b> <b>fasteners</b> and inclined screws can effectively be combined. Bending tests (6. 4 m span) were carried out using double-sided nail plates as shear connectors, with and without combination with inclined screws. The double-sided nail plate connectors did behave satisfactorily in terms of strength and stiffness for the beam design considered, even when not combined with screws. It is however suggested that furtherresearch should be carried out before using double-sided nail plates as the sole shear connection in timber composite floor elements. It was found that, for the design and load case considered, the new shear connection system performs satisfactorily and could fulfil necessary design criteria. It is considered that the shear connection system may be suitable for floor spans up to 7 meters. Further research is necessary in order to assess the behaviour ofdouble-sided nail plates under long term loadings and, combined shear and separation forces. An analytical linear elastic model for the stiffness of inclined screw joints was derived. This model takes into account the dowel and withdrawal action of the screw as well as the friction between the timber members. The linear elastic model is general and allows prediction of theload-deformation behaviour of inclined screw joints in shear tension in the serviceability limit state for different angle inclinations. One of the advantages of this model is that different material properties and geometries can be used in each of the jointed members. The model is found to be appropriate for inclination angles between 30 and 60 degrees between the screw axis and the normal to the shear plane. Further material testing is necessary in order to obtain certain material parameters for this model. Godkänd; 2015; 20150413 (nicjac...|$|R

40|$|Structural {{design is}} today {{concerned}} with single component performance where each limit state {{is related to}} a single mode of failure of a single component. Further, in limit state codes the strength variables are related to a deterministic value (usually the 5 -percentile). However, in a structure {{with a number of}} elements, two different effects (called system effects) can be found: The probabilistic system effect that is based on the reduced probability that weak sections coincide with the most stressed sections. Structural load-sharing that is the ability to redistribute load between members. In this paper, Monte Carlo simulations of a timber W-truss with punched metal <b>plate</b> <b>fasteners</b> (nail <b>plates)</b> are performed. Structural timber displays a significant variability in strength and stiffness both within and between members and is described by a statistic model calibrated against data from Norway spruce (Picea abies).

The FE calculations are performed by TrussLab - a toolbox for MATLAB developed at Aalborg University. TrussLab considers contact between timber members and non-linear behaviour of the joints. The timber members are given linear properties. The system effect is based on reliability analyses.
