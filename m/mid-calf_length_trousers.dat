50|$|From a {{practical}} perspective, this broad bonnet captured much needed cooling breezes during the hot Maltese summer. On cooler days, the wearer could wrap the għonnella {{around her face}} more tightly, by making a slight adjustment. The {{lower part of the}} għonnella could be worn loosely draped around the wearer's bodice and hips, or more tightly wrapped in the case of inclement weather. It would typically fall to <b>mid-calf</b> <b>length.</b> While walking, the wearer would hold one or both sides of the għonnella clasped in her right hand.|$|R

The other complementary feature of the Punjabi suit is the dupatta; often used to cover the chest and head. Among the Punjabi people, the dupatta {{has long been a}} symbol of modesty.|$|R
5000|$|The {{immediate}} successor of the DMS boot was the [...] "Boot, Combat High" [...] - or as {{the soldiers}} themselves described it, the Boot Cardboard Horrible. Basically {{little more than a}} toecapless DMS boot extended up to <b>mid-calf</b> <b>length,</b> it was scarcely better than its predecessor. Theoretically waterproofed, it was therefore sweaty and unpleasant, and could cause acute tendinitis. A MkII version was introduced to solve this, but found little favour. Its only real advantage was that it was not supposed to be 'bulled' to a mirror shine.|$|R

5000|$|Bachelors' and masters' gowns in the United States {{are similar}} to their {{counterparts}} in the United Kingdom, though bachelor's gowns are now designed to be worn closed, and all are at least <b>mid-calf</b> <b>length</b> to ankle-length. [...] The masters' gown sleeve is oblong and, though the base of the sleeve hangs down in the typical manner, it is square cut at the rear part of the oblong shape. The front part has an arc cut away, and there is a slit for the wrist opening, {{but the rest of the}} arc is closed. The shape is evocative of the square-cut liripipe incorporated into many academic hoods (see, below). The master's gown is designed to be worn open or closed.|$|R
5000|$|Her {{clothes are}} {{normally}} quite conservative. In {{the first three}} seasons, she often wears floral, collared, <b>mid-calf</b> <b>length,</b> button down dresses with white ankle socks and oxfords. She also often wears high-waisted, tapered black jeans or pants and a bright blazer. For work, she dresses more formally. Peter Mehlman reveals on audio commentary in [...] "The Sponge" [...] and [...] "The Betrayal" [...] that female fans favor the brown leather jacket that she wears from Season 7 onward. Occasionally, she's entirely out of her usual attire, as in [...] "The Betrayal" [...] (when she wears an Indian outfit and hairstyle) and [...] "The Millennium" [...] (where she dons Mayan dress). Elaine also wears glasses at times, usually during work hours.|$|R

Accessories include wide silk belts, red or black caps, and cotton socks worn over their footwear called opanci (strapped soft soled sandals).|$|R
2500|$|Republican Rome {{viewed the}} draped {{clothing}} of Greek and Minoan (Cretan) culture as {{an emblem of}} civilisation and disdained trousers as the mark of barbarians. [...] As the Empire expanded beyond the Mediterranean basin, however, the greater warmth provided by trousers led to their adoption. Two types of trousers eventually saw widespread use in Rome: the Feminalia, which fit snugly and usually fell to knee or <b>mid-calf</b> <b>length,</b> and the Braccae, a loose-fitting trouser that was closed at the ankles. Both garments were adopted originally from the Celts of Europe, although later familiarity with the Persian Near East and the Teutons increased acceptance. [...] Feminalia and Braccae both began use as military garments, spreading to civilian dress later, and were eventually made {{in a variety of}} materials including leather, wool, cotton and silk.|$|R
