40|$|This Master's Thesis {{deals with}} the EU {{competition}} law enforcement towards undertakings in the energy industry. The attention of the thesis is devoted only to {{the part of the}} energy industry, gas and electricity sectors, as the EU decided to liberalize these markets in the mid- 1990 s with the aim of gradually transform them into the single European energy market, which will be fully open to the competition. The aim of the thesis is to answer research question, what the specifics of the EU competition law enforcement towards undertakings in the energy industry are. The first chapter {{deals with the}} fundamental competition law rules, which are analysed in the thesis within the energy industry. These are prohibition of the agreements which have as their object or effect the restriction of competition (regulated in the Art. 101 TFEU) and prohibition of the abuse of dominant position (regulated in the Art. 102 TFEU). Besides these rules, which are enforced ex post, the chapter also deals with the control of <b>merger</b> <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> by the Commission as an ex ant competition law enforcement towards notified mergers. The chapter further looks at the main objectives of the competition law and the means the Commission has at its disposal to competition law enforcement.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{in this paper}} is to make an {{in-depth}} analysis of the regulatory situations that can arise during mergers when political involvement takes place. The research is based on four controversial <b>merger</b> cases <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> within the same country (E. On-Ruhrgas), European Union countries (E. On-Endesa, Unicredit-Hypoverein) and between companies from the USA (Boeing-McDonnell Douglas) that have effect on the European market. We analyze the four mergers using Michele Ruta and Massimo Motta models from the paper "A Political Economy <b>of</b> <b>Merger</b> Policy in International Markets" (2008). By the end of the research we reached the conclusion that due to some lapses in the European Commission Merger regulation at the time <b>of</b> the <b>mergers,</b> as well as due to government involvement in the mergers, they are not always cleared in the benefit of the market competition or consumer welfare, but due to nationalistic interests of governments to have big players on the market or to keep governmental power in certain industries, even with the risk of harming competition. Along with this, from the mergers analyzed here, it becomes clear that local or union authorities scrutinize the foreign acquirers more.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of the social implications <b>of</b> transfers <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> is a topic that has made its way in the European law with quite enough difficulty, but became in time an increasingly discussed topic. Since the {{transfer of an undertaking}} from an employer to another could not be achieved with disregard of its human capital, the European legislator has established a legal framework ensuring the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event <b>of</b> transfers <b>of</b> <b>undertakings.</b> Currently, the main legal basis in the field consists of Council Directive 2001 / 23 /EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event <b>of</b> transfers <b>of</b> <b>undertakings,</b> businesses or parts <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> or businesses - the Transfer Directive. The paper aims to achieve a critical analysis of European regulations on the protection of employees' rights in the event <b>of</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> as a result <b>of</b> a <b>merger.</b> The scope <b>of</b> the Transfer Directive, the obligation to inform and consult employees in advance and the transfer of rights and obligations arising from the contract of employment as a result <b>of</b> a <b>merger</b> are being approached.

40|$|This article {{reports on}} the use <b>of</b> {{enforceable}} <b>undertakings</b> by the Australian employment standards enforcement agency, the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO), and its predecessor, the Workplace Ombudsman. Enforceable undertakings are used by the FWO as an alternative enforcement tool to court litigation in relation to breaches of the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth), which regulates wages, working hours and other minimum employment conditions. Proponents <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings</b> argue that they deliver value to regulatory agencies as a responsive alternative to traditional, punitive enforcement action. On the other hand, critics have raised concerns about the accountability and effectiveness of this enforcement tool. The authors provide a critical analysis of the FWO&# 039;s use <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings,</b> including consideration <b>of</b> the decision-making process, content, monitoring and enforcement <b>of</b> <b>undertakings.</b> The analysis {{is based on a}} review <b>of</b> all enforceable <b>undertakings</b> concluded in the period from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2012, as well as qualitative interviews with approximately 60 inspectors, managers and lawyers of the FWO, and a number of specialist workplace relations lawyers. The article reveals that the FWO has made limited but promising use <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings</b> in the review period. Through deployment <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings,</b> the FWO has demonstrated that it has a mix of regulatory approaches available to it that are consistent with the key principles of responsive regulation. The number <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings</b> accepted by the FWO, however, remains fairly limited.
