5000|$|Most commonly, multipart/alternative is {{used for}} email with two parts, one plain text (text/plain) and one HTML (text/html). The plain text part {{provides}} backwards compatibility while the HTML part allows use of formatting and hyperlinks.

50|$|IExpress Wizard {{interface}} {{guides the}} user {{through the process}} of creating a self-extracting package. It asks what the package should do: extract files and then run a program, or just extract files. It then allows the user to specify a title for the package, add a confirmation prompt, add a license agreement that the end-user must accept in order to allow extraction, select files to be archived, set display options for the progress window, and finally, specify a <b>message</b> <b>to</b> <b>display</b> upon completion.If the option to create an archive and run a program is selected, then there will be an additional step, prompting the user to select the program that will be run upon extraction.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} new system for SMS {{information}} display board. The system will display texts and icons of {{a message on the}} matrix LED. To sending a message to the system, A user have to send a message SMS on a mobile phone. It's mean, the user can be anywhere in the range of mobile signal to control the message on the display board. Furthermore, the user is able to control the pattern, speed and time duration of the display message. In additional, the user can set the time of the <b>message</b> <b>to</b> <b>display</b> on the system in advance or cancel it. The system provide the security by using password method to verified the authorize user only. Finally the system can apply to variety of usage with a lot of concurrent users and message scheduling application...|$|E

50|$|Falcon's Eye was {{developed}} by Jaakko Peltonen, a researcher of neural networks at Helsinki University of Technology, originally as a separate engine, and then grafted onto NetHack. The artwork and sound effects are largely his, with some submissions from users. NetHack code assumes little about the user interface, telling which dungeon maps and <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>display,</b> but leaves the implementation details to the interface. Peltonen explains that this versatility helped him to create Falcon's Eye, as {{he did not have}} to work around a fixed character-based interface.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the idea, first implementation {{and evaluation of}} an environment based messaging system. The basic motivation builds on the observation that it is sometimes more convenient to leave or send a <b>message</b> <b>to</b> a specific location as opposed to presenting it to a certain person (like when using SMS or email). We show and give conclusions from the first iteration {{of a system that}} allows sending text <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> small <b>display</b> devices that are kept at certain locations. Using gestures as input method, one can choose between possible answers defined by the sender of each message. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Flying Message Service (FMS) is {{a design}} project {{promoting}} community-based messaging in public {{spaces in the}} city. We have built a system that enables people <b>to</b> attach electronic <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> pigeons. From input stations located in public plazas, pigeons would transmit text <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> be <b>displayed</b> on large public screens at plazas throughout the city. The project evolved through ethnographic and experimental design methods and resulted in a working electronic prototype tested in a public square in Göteborg. Our approach and prototype are described in this paper, along with a preliminary user experience evaluation. FMS is a technologically-based cultural system that augments urban environments and animal behaviours to support local communications and communities...|$|R
50|$|The {{federal grant}} came {{along with the}} EBA railway authority's order in 2010 to have all {{stations}} get connected to the travel information system to announce delays with an electronic signage or loudspeakers. The Deutsche Bahn operator tried to proceed legally against that order for stations with very low frequency but she lost all lawsuits in 2015. It was given 18 months to equip the remaining stations which was done with DSAs. The DSA system has a GSM radio module to receive a text <b>message</b> <b>to</b> be <b>displayed</b> in a horizontally moving news ticker style. When there's no delay the current time is shown statically on its 96×8 LED dot-matrix display. A loudspeaker may optionally be mounted on top.|$|R
