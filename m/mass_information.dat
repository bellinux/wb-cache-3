40|$|This study, {{conducted}} in 1997, {{aimed to explore}} in depth the views and experiences of women with breast cancer concerning disease-related <b>mass</b> media <b>information.</b> Three age-stratified, unstructured focus group discussions were convened with thirty women with breast cancer (n = 11, 12 and 7). The discussions were audiotaped and transcribed in full and the transcripts were analysed using theme analysis. A number of themes concerning mass media breast cancer information were identified. Women sought and paid attention to information {{from a variety of}} mass media sources, including medical books and journals, leaflets, videotapes, women's magazines, newspapers and television programmes. <b>Mass</b> media <b>information</b> was thought to possess a number of advantages. In particular, participants viewed mass media sources such as magazines and television as helpful in raising breast cancer awareness in the general population. <b>Mass</b> media <b>information,</b> however, was also viewed as having a number of disadvantages. For example, once diagnosed, participants thought that mass media sources such as magazines were frightening and depressing owing to their often negative and sensationalised nature. This finding was particularly worrying as women with breast cancer looked for and were often 'drawn' to such communication vehicles. To conclude, <b>mass</b> media <b>information</b> has advantages and disadvantages and its impact upon individuals may depend on their disease status. It is important that editors of mass media sources such as women's magazines are aware of this dichotomy and are prepared to provide accurate, factual and less dramatised breast cancer information...|$|R

In education {{and awareness}} applications, SMS messages are sent directly to users' phones to offer information about various subjects, including testing and treatment methods, availability of health services, and disease management. SMSs provide an advantage of being relatively unobtrusive, offering patients confidentiality in environments where disease (especially HIV/AIDS) is often taboo. Additionally, SMSs provide an avenue to reach far-reaching areas—such as rural areas—which may have limited access to public health information and education, health clinics, and a deficit of healthcare workers.|$|E
