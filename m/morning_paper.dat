Its principal newspaper is Fyens Stiftstidende, a daily broadsheet owned by Den Fynske Bladfond and published by Fyens Stiftstidende A/S, which was established on 3 January 1772. Until 1841 the newspaper was known as Kongelig Priviligerede Odense Adresse-Contoirs Efterretninger, and on 13 April 1993 the newspaper changed its 221-year-old tradition as a midday newspaper, to a <b>morning</b> <b>paper.</b> In 2013, it had an average circulation of 47,738, down from some 60,500 in 2005. The editor in chief, Per Westergård, chairs the board of the Centre for Journalism at the University of Southern Denmark, one of the two university journalism departments in Denmark. Denmark's largest university press, the University Press of Southern Denmark, is also based in Odense. It was founded in 1966 as Odense University Press (Odense Universitetsforlag), and its authors are mainly academics from the University of Southern Denmark.|$|E

25|$|At {{the age of}} 22, Glass finally {{became a}} reporter, a job he had long sought, for the Lynchburg News. He rose to become the morning newspaper's editor by 1887. The {{following}} year, the publisher retired and offered Glass an option to purchase the business. Desperate to find financial backing, Glass received the unexpected assistance from a relative who loaned him enough for a $100 down payment on the $13,000 deal. Free to write and publish whatever he wished, Glass wrote bold editorials and encouraged tougher reporting in the <b>morning</b> <b>paper,</b> which increased sales. Soon, Glass was able to acquire the afternoon Daily Advance, then to buy out the competing Daily Republican. Thus he became Lynchburg's sole newspaper publisher; the modern-day Lynchburg News and Advance is the successor publication to his newspapers.|$|E

25|$|In 1977, the Knowland Family {{sold the}} Oakland Tribune to Combined Communications Corporation, owned by Arizona-based outdoor sign mogul Karl Eller. The Tribune Publishing Corporation, was {{dissolved}} by the Knowland Family. Eller had recently acquired The Cincinnati Enquirer. In 1979, CCC {{merged with the}} East Coast-based media conglomerate Gannett, and the Tribune was thus acquired by Gannett. That year, Allen H. Neuharth, Gannett CEO, used the Tribune as a pilot project with a new <b>morning</b> <b>paper</b> called Eastbay TODAY, which served as an early prototype of Gannett's later national paper USA TODAY. In 1979, Gannett named Robert C. Maynard (1937–1993) editor, becoming the first African-American editor in the paper's history. In 1983, Maynard—who by this time had become publisher and with Gannett's blessing—consolidated the Tribune and Eastbay TODAY into a single morning newspaper under the Tribune name.|$|E
25|$|The Chattanooga Times Free Press, the area's only daily newspaper, is {{published}} every morning. It {{was formed in}} 1999 from the merger of two papers that had been bitter rivals for half a century, the Times and the News-Free Press. The Times was owned and published by Adolph Ochs, who later bought the New York Times. The Times was the <b>morning</b> <b>paper</b> and had a generally more liberal editorial page. The News-Free Press, whose name {{was the result of}} an earlier merger, was an afternoon daily and its editorials were more conservative than those in the Times. On August 27, 1966, the News-Free Press became the first newspaper in the nation to dissolve a joint operating agreement. In 1999, the Free Press, which had changed its name from News-Free Press in 1993, was bought by an Arkansas company, WEHCO Media, publisher of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, which then bought The Times from the Ochs heirs. The Times Free Press is the only newspaper in the United States to have 2 editorial pages, each reflecting opposite ends of the political spectrum. The Times' editorial page, which is liberal, is on the left page and the Free Press' editorial page, which is conservative, is on the right page.|$|E

Disraeli impressed Murray with his energy and commitment to the project, but he failed in his key task of persuading the eminent writer John Gibson Lockhart to edit the paper. After that, Disraeli's influence on Murray waned, and to his resentment he was sidelined in ...|$|E

500|$|Hartman {{had been}} {{divorced}} twice before he married Brynn Omdahl in 1987; {{the couple had}} two children together. However, their marriage was fractured, {{due in part to}} her drug use. On May 28, 1998, Brynn Hartman shot and killed Hartman while he slept in their Encino, Los Angeles home, then committed suicide several hours later. In the weeks following his death, Hartman was celebrated in a wave of tributes. Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly opined that Hartman was [...] "the last person you'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your <b>morning</b> <b>paper</b> [...] a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with". Hartman was posthumously inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2012 and the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2014.|$|E

Pam reveals to her coworkers that she has committed {{a great deal of money}} to her upcoming wedding and has had no response to the weekend part-time job applications she's submitted. Ryan responds by confessing that he never actually went to Thailand.|$|E
500|$|The Tribune's demise hastened a {{settlement}} of the strike. Discontinued as a <b>morning</b> <b>paper,</b> the Tribune name {{was added to the}} afternoon publication and on September 12, 1966, the new World Journal Tribune published its first issue. [...] "It was not a bad paper," [...] according to Tribune historian Richard Kluger, and featured many Tribune writers, including Wolfe, Breslin, Kerr and columnist Dick Schaap, and incorporated New York as its Sunday magazine. The first weeks' editions were dominated by the input of the Hearst and Scripps papers, but after a time, the [...] "Widget" [...] (as the merged publication was nicknamed) took on the appearance and style of the late-era Tribune. The World Journal Tribune reached a circulation near 700,000—fourth-largest for American evening newspapers at the time—but had high overhead costs and relatively little advertising. Whitney eventually withdrew support for the newspaper, but Scripps and Hearst continued to back it until the paper folded on May 5, 1967.|$|E
