5|$|If {{ever there}} was a book {{calculated}} to make a man in love with its author, this appears to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of unbounded attachment.|$|E
5|$|When Ian Fleming {{sold the}} film {{rights to the}} James Bond novels to Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, he gave {{permission}} only for the title The Spy Who Loved <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used. Since the screenplay for the film {{had nothing to do}} with Fleming's original novel, Eon Productions, for the first time, authorised a novelisation based upon the script. This would also be the first regular Bond novel published since Colonel Sun nearly a decade earlier. Christopher Wood, who co-authored the screenplay, was commissioned to write the book titled James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E

5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God.

25|$|I {{have long}} been gravitating towards the Socialist {{position}} — {{of course there is}} Socialism and Socialism, and mine is of the reasonable and moderate kind.

25|$|On September 14, 2000, Microsoft {{released}} Windows ME (Millennium Edition), {{the last}} DOS-based version of Windows.

However, Windows ME was faced with criticism for its speed and instability, along with hardware compatibility issues and its removal of real mode DOS support.

His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but in 1971, after losing to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, he wrote to a friend: That Nobel Prize! I hope I never hear it mentioned again. I certainly don't want it; the machinery behind it seems a bit dirty, when we thought that only applied to Australian awards.
