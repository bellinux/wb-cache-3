500|$|From the mid-1850s, Emily's mother became {{effectively}} bedridden {{with various}} chronic illnesses {{until her death}} in 1882. Writing to a friend in summer 1858, Emily {{said that she would}} visit if she could leave [...] "home, or mother. I do not go out at all, lest father will come and <b>miss</b> <b>me,</b> or miss some little act, which I might forget, should I run away– Mother is much as usual. I Know not what to hope of her". As her mother continued to decline, Dickinson's domestic responsibilities weighed more heavily upon her and she confined herself within the Homestead. Forty years later, Lavinia stated that because their mother was chronically ill, one of the daughters had to remain always with her. Emily took this role as her own, and [...] "finding the life with her books and nature so congenial, continued to live it".|$|E
500|$|Steve Huey of Allmusic {{contrasts}} Brooks' and Dunn's voices, {{saying that}} Dunn [...] "was the quietly intense singer with the soulful voice, while Kix Brooks played {{the part of}} the high-energy showman." [...] He also describes their sound as [...] "a winning formula of rambunctious, rocked-up honky tonk with punchy, danceable beats [...] smooth, pop-tinged ballads." [...] In the book The New Generation of County Music Stars, David Dicaire describes Dunn as [...] "possess a soulful voice with a quiet intensity" [...] and a [...] "traditional country singer", while calling Brooks [...] "the opposite to Dunn's musical personality," [...] "a high-energy showman" [...] and [...] "the perfect accompaniment to his partner". Brooks sang lead on [...] "Lost and Found", [...] "Rock My World", [...] "You're Gonna <b>Miss</b> <b>Me</b> When I'm Gone", [...] "Mama Don't Get Dressed Up for Nothing", [...] "Why Would I Say Goodbye", and [...] "South of Santa Fe".|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} 1994, the duo {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Waitin' on Sundown. It also produced five charting singles, three of which made {{number one on the}} country charts: [...] "She's Not the Cheatin' Kind", [...] "Little Miss Honky Tonk" [...] and [...] "You're Gonna <b>Miss</b> <b>Me</b> When I'm Gone". The other two singles, [...] "I'll Never Forgive My Heart" [...] and [...] "Whiskey Under the Bridge", both made top ten. Allmusic critic Thom Owens thought that the album's singles were [...] "solid" [...] but {{that the rest of the}} songs were [...] "filler". A review of the single [...] "She's Not the Cheatin' Kind" [...] from the same site praised it for its [...] "hard-driving, honky-tonk spirit". Nash praised the honky-tonk sound of [...] "I'll Never Forgive My Heart", but thought that most of the other songs relied on [...] "contrivance". Randy Lewis of the Orlando Sentinel gave a generally positive review, saying that the [...] "minidrama" [...] of [...] "A Few Good Rides Away" [...] (which Brooks co-wrote) was the strongest track on the album.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 October, The Veronicas {{performed}} seven tracks {{from the}} album {{for the first}} time on radio for Today Network's World Famous Rooftop. The set included [...] "If You Love Someone", [...] "Cruel", [...] "Did You <b>Miss</b> <b>Me</b> (I'm a Veronica)", [...] "Sanctified", [...] "Mad Love", [...] "Cold" [...] and [...] "You Ruin Me". The duo supported 5 Seconds of Summer on the USA leg of their Rock Out with Your Socks Out Tour during November 2014 in Los Angeles and Phoenix. During the Phoenix shows, Jessica and Lisa wore identical figure hugging latex dresses in black and red, respectively, which were designed by Abigail Grey Danus.|$|E
2500|$|Kahlo's {{right leg}} was amputated {{at the knee}} due to {{gangrene}} in August 1953. She became severely depressed and anxious, and her dependency on painkillers escalated. When Rivera began yet another affair, she attempted suicide by overdose. She wrote in her diary in February 1954 that [...] "they have given me centuries of torture and at moments I almost lost my reason. I keep on wanting to kill myself. Diego is what keeps me from it, through my vain idea that he would <b>miss</b> <b>me.</b> ... But {{never in my life}} have I suffered more. I will wait a while..." [...] She was again hospitalized in April and May. That spring, she resumed painting after a one-year interval. Her last paintings include the political Marxism Will Give Health to the Sick (c. 1954) and Frida and Stalin (c. 1954), and the still-life Viva La Vida (1954).|$|E

2500|$|Luo Tong {{was from}} Wushang County (烏傷縣), Kuaiji Commandery, which is around present-day Yiwu, Zhejiang. His father Luo Jun (駱俊), {{who served as}} the Chancellor (相) of Chen State (陳國) in the Eastern Han dynasty, was killed by the warlord Yuan Shu. Luo Tong's mother {{remarried}} after her husband's death, and became a concubine of the official Hua Xin. Luo Tong, who was seven years old then, returned to Kuaiji Commandery with his close friends. Before he left, his mother tearfully saw him off, but Luo Tong did not look back when he boarded the carriage. When the carriage driver told him his mother was behind him, Luo Tong said, [...] "I don't want to make my mother <b>miss</b> <b>me</b> even more. That's why I don't look back." [...] Luo Tong was also known for being filial to his stepmother (Hua Xin's official spouse).|$|E
2500|$|Bass and McClure {{followed}} their early success with [...] "You'll <b>Miss</b> <b>Me</b> (When I'm Gone)" [...] that summer, {{a song that}} had mild success, reaching the Top 30 on the R chart, although it made no significant impression on the pop chart. After a brief tour, Bass returned to the studio. The result was an original composition with an aggressive rhythm section; backing musicians on the track included drummer Maurice White (later the leader of Earth, Wind, & Fire), bassist Louis Satterfield and tenor saxophonist Gene Barge, with the young Minnie Riperton among the background singers. The song, [...] "Rescue Me", shot up the charts {{in the fall and}} winter of 1965. After a month-long run {{at the top of the}} R charts, the song reached #4 on the US pop charts and #11 in the UK, and gave Chess its first million-selling single since Chuck Berry a decade earlier. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Harrison {{moved back}} home to Berlin, where she opened a {{consignment}} shop which she named [...] "Harrison's Peach Tree" [...] {{half a mile from}} the house where she was born and raised. Several years later, wanting to be closer to her sons, she returned to Los Angeles and obtained a real estate license, like her eldest sister, Kay. In 1995, she landed a small part as the [...] "Madam" [...] in Wild Bill. In 1998, she appeared as herself in the Kevin Burns TV documentary Behind the Planet of the Apes about the making of the first five Planet of the Apes films. In October 1998, Harrison attended her first science fiction convention in New Jersey. Also in attendance were Jonathan Harris, Marta Kristen, Mark Goddard and Angela Cartwright, of the original Lost in Space TV series; Lou Ferrigno of The Incredible Hulk TV series; and Bela Lugosi Jr. and Sara Karloff. Harrison found it [...] "rewarding when you really haven't done anything {{for a number of years}} and then, all of a sudden, people want your autograph. It was very gratifying." [...] Eventually, Harrison became an institution at Planet of the Apes cons. [...] "I like it. It's very good. You're being appreciated for your work." [...] In 2001, she had a cameo as the [...] "Woman in Cart" [...] in Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes. [...] "They are much more brutal in the new movie," [...] she said. [...] "And strong. They literally hurl the humans 50 or 60 [...] feet." [...] Most of the footage Harrison shot was omitted from the final, so [...] "if you blink you <b>miss</b> <b>me.</b> They showed my shots all over the place, but it got cut out." ...|$|E
