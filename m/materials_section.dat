The flat material surface is assigned on a flat <b>material</b> <b>section</b> (1). A coupling agent is partially added between two flat <b>material</b> <b>sections</b> in mutually overlapping fiber components. USE - Method for manufacturing a three-dimensional object through a generative manufacturing process after laminated object manufacturing. ADVANTAGE - The coupling agent is partially added between two flat <b>material</b> <b>sections</b> in mutually overlapping fiber components, and hence ensures manufacturing a light-weight object with improved stability features...|$|R

Cutting resistance which is proportional  to section area of  the layer to be cut and, correspondingly, a thermodynamic intensity in the polishing zone depend on S с value. The paper proposes relations for calculation of a <b>material</b> <b>section</b> area S с which is to be removed from a blank while forming a space between two teeth of a satellite gear of a planetary pin tooth reducer.
