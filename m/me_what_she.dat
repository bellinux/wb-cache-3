500|$|When Diane first played <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{had begun}} with the song, I needed no convincing about the record... {{it was about}} sharing that part of myself with the world... We {{talked a lot about}} what I felt the song needed in order to reach as many young people as possible. I felt that it needed to not stay in a purely {{emotional}} state, but {{that it was going to}} somehow grow throughout the performance and the song and by the end, kind of be full of rage. I feel like what this song accomplishes is women—or men—rising to say, 'You think you can hurt me? You don't know about power. Because after what you did to me, you don't even know how much stronger I am.' ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Kim" [...] was {{the first}} song the rapper {{recorded}} for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998. Eminem wrote [...] "Kim" [...] {{at a time in}} which {{he and his wife were}} separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, [...] "I asked her to tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this'. [...] " [...] The song [...] "Stan" [...] was produced by The 45 King. Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's [...] "Thank You". Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for [...] "Stan" [...] differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: [...] "'Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about. [...] " [...] Dido later heard [...] "Stan" [...] and enjoyed it, and observed, [...] "I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, 'We like your album, we've used this track. Hope you don't mind, and hope you like it. ' When they sent [...] to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, 'Wow! This track's amazing. '" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But tell <b>me,</b> <b>what</b> can <b>she</b> have to do? I {{thought you}} London ladies {{had nothing to}} do, but to sit with your hands before you {{entertaining}} company." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why don't you speak?" [...] he asked, suspiciously. [...] "Has {{she been}} telling you a pack of lies about <b>me?</b> <b>What</b> did <b>she</b> say when she came home?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nobody has {{dared to}} condemn me, except this impudent woman here, who wants {{an excuse for}} not paying <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> owes me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You come, I suppose, by {{the orders}} of your mistress, to visit Lord Evandale?--Tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> desires; her orders shall be my law." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless, I {{suppose she}} will tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> knows," [...] I said. [...] "Give me the Bradshaw, Allan, and that old Continental guide." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear fellow, {{she tried}} to found a salon, and only succeeded in opening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell <b>me,</b> <b>what</b> did <b>she</b> say about Mr. Dorian Gray?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not," [...] {{said the}} editor, {{somewhat}} impatient under the singular scrutiny of Mr. Bowers; [...] "and I'm {{very anxious to}} know how <b>she</b> looks. Tell <b>me,</b> <b>what</b> is <b>she</b> like?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know she}} has been telling you," [...] {{continued}} Margaret. [...] "I know she would not let {{you go to bed}} without accusing me. Tell <b>me,</b> John, <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has told you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Such {{faith in}} a Sergeant of Marines {{interested}} me greatly. [...] "Never mind about that," [...] I cried. [...] "Tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come! Your sister Betsey Trotwood {{would have}} told <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thought of anyone, directly. Be as like your sister as you can, and speak out!' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} see {{for the life of}} <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was driving at, but I assented sorrowfully. At any rate, I was holding my own.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me all!" [...] he implored. [...] "I {{must know}} the worst--before I see her. Tell <b>me</b> everything; <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{said at the}} very last." [...] His voice broke into sobs as he dropped to a couch.|$|R
60|$|Troil. Then you're no more my friend: And {{for your}} sake,--now mark <b>me</b> <b>what</b> I say,-- <b>She</b> shall not go.|$|R
6000|$|I {{remember}} how I handled and scrutinized that letter, seeking for some intimation that our former intimacy was still alive. We were to meet. How should we meet? How would <b>she</b> look at <b>me?</b> <b>What</b> would <b>she</b> think of me? ...|$|R
6000|$|THE STATUE. I! Oh, I {{swore that}} I would be {{faithful}} to the death; that I should die if they refused me; that no woman could ever be to <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} King, much {{amazed at the}} ignorance and temerity of the youth, [...] "go and speak to my {{daughter}} about the matter, and then come and tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> replies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To my mind," [...] he said, [...] "Lady Janet herself sets all further doubt at rest. Her letter tells <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted {{when she}} sent for Horace, and why {{my name was}} {{mentioned}} between them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Instead of answering, Henry put {{his hand}} under the chin of his child, who was leaning against him, and holding up her face to his brother, said, [...] "Thou canst see this child's face? Tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> like <b>she</b> is." ...|$|R
60|$|Eunice neither moved nor answered. Having {{some doubt}} {{of what might}} happen if the two girls {{remained}} together, I proposed to Helena to leave the garden and to let <b>me</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had to say, in the house.|$|R
50|$|Among other better-known {{compositions}} were Puppets; When You Left <b>Me</b> and <b>What</b> Has <b>She</b> Got That I Haven't Got.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know that," [...] I said. [...] "I {{have seen}} her; she told <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did, and I treated her as I would treat {{a boy who}} had brushed my coat, but I shall make amends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, I being Mrs. Wilmot, should {{certainly}} be mortified if Miss Rivers deserted me because {{the children were}} naughty. I think, I think I had rather she came and asked <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had better do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who?" [...] he answered, {{dropping}} his glass. [...] "Madame Blumenthal! What! It would {{take long to}} say. Be introduced; it's easily done; you will find her charming. Then, after a week, you will tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lame," [...] said Mrs. Proudie; [...] "I'd lame her if <b>she</b> {{belonged to}} <b>me.</b> <b>What</b> {{business}} had <b>she</b> here at all?--such impertinence--such affectation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An injudicious promise, Barbara. You do {{the child}} more harm by {{implying}} such an opinion of her {{than you could}} do by letting <b>me</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has actually done. But you are absolved from the promise, for she has herself told me." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus did <b>she</b> punish <b>me</b> for <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{considered}} my want {{of curiosity}} or interest; I knew {{it as well}} as if she had told me so. I accepted the rebuff and said no more, and she went on with her reading.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{know she}} had been writing to you, but I {{know that you are}} talking of Imogene. She told <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had said to you yesterday, and I blamed her for it, but I'm not sure that it wasn't best." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She did {{not speak}} {{in the way you}} fancy; but I asked her, and I would make her tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thought of you, or rather how she felt towards you. I wanted to know; I had long wanted to know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fine. That fellow Gray {{is still}} hanging round Babe. It beats <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> sees in him. Anybody but an infant {{could see the}} man wasn't on the level. Well, I don't blame you for quitting London, George. This sort of thing is worth fifty Londons." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing horrid--ah dear no." [...] And {{something}} in Mrs. Munden's tone, {{with the way}} she appeared to muse a moment, even suggested to <b>me</b> that <b>what</b> <b>she</b> [...] "oughtn't" [...] was perhaps what Lady Beldonald had too much neglected. [...] "She hasn't got on." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Yeobright {{declined}} to say. [...] "He {{is a man}} Thomasin likes," [...] she added, [...] "and one whose constancy she respects at least. It seems to <b>me</b> that <b>what</b> <b>she</b> refused then she {{would be glad to}} get now. She is much annoyed at her awkward position." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Garnett: [...] "I {{expected}} she would." [...] She fetches {{a thoughtful}} sigh, {{and for her}} greater emotional convenience she sinks into an easy-chair and leans forward. [...] "Oh dear! It is a scrape." [...] Suddenly and imperatively: [...] "Tell <b>me</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did, if you hope for any help whatever." ...|$|R
