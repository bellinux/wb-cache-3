40|$|A fully {{automated}} liquid chromatographic (LC) method for the simultaneous determination of <b>methylphenobarbital</b> enantiomers and phenobarbital in human plasma has been developed. The method {{is based on}} the use of a precolumn packed with an internal-surface reversed-phase packing material (LiChrospher ADS) for sample clean-up coupled to LC analysis on a cellulose tris(4 -methylbenzoate) based chiral stationary phase (Chiralcel OJ-R). A 100 -microliter plasma sample was injected directly on the precolumn packed with LiChrospher RP- 18 ADS using a mixture of pH 5. 0 phosphate buffer-methanol (97 : 3, v/v) as washing liquid. The analytes were then eluted in the back-flush mode with the LC mobile phase. The enantiomeric separation of <b>methylphenobarbital</b> was achieved on Chiralcel OJ-R). The retention times were modelled using a D-optimal design with ten experimental points in order to optimise the LC mobile phase for the separation of phenobarbital from the enantiomers of mephobarbital. The factors selected were the acetonitrile content, the pH and the sodium perchlorate concentration in the mobile phase. A Derringer's desirability function was used to find an optimal and robust solution within the experimental domain. The mobile phase selected consisted of a mixture of pH 7. 0 phosphate buffer-acetonitrile (60 : 40, v/v). The elution profiles of phenobarbital, <b>methylphenobarbital</b> and blank plasma samples on the precolumn and the time needed for analyte transfer from the precolumn to the analytical column were then determined. Finally, the method developed was validated. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The study {{goal was}} to assess {{teratogenic}} effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) {{through the use of}} a surveillance system (MADRE) of infants with malformations. Methods: Information on all malformed infants (1990 - 1996) with maternal first-trimester drug exposure was collected by the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects and Monitoring Systems (ICBDMS). Cases were defined as infants presenting with a specific malformation, and controls were defined as infants presenting with any other birth defect. Exposure was defined by the use of AEDs during the first trimester of pregnancy. The association of AEDs with malformations was then estimated by calculating the odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals and testing their homogeneity among registries. Results: Among 8005 cases of malformations, 299 infants were exposed in utero to AEDs. Of those exposed to monotherapy, 65 were exposed to phenobarbital, 10 to <b>methylphenobarbital,</b> 80 to valproic acid, 46 to carbamazepine, 24 to phenytoin, and 16 to other AEDs, Associations were found for spina bifida with valproic acid. Infants exposed to phenobarbital and to <b>methylphenobarbital</b> showed an increased risk of oral clefts. Cardiac malformations were found to be associated with phenobarbital, <b>methylphenobarbital,</b> valproic acid, and carbamazepine. Hypospadias was associated with valproic acid. Porencephaly and other specified anomalies of brain, anomalies of face, coarctation of aorta, and limb reduction defects were found to be associated with valproic acid. Conclusions: Using the MADRE system, we confirmed known teratogenic effects of AEDs. We also found increased risks for malformations that had never been reported associated with AEDs or for which the association was suggested by case reports...|$|E
40|$|Summary: A simple, rapid, quantitative, {{low-cost}} UV-differential {{spectrophotometric method}} for the routine monitoring of phenobarbitai in serum and cerebrospinal fluid is described. This method {{can also be}} used for moni-toring <b>methylphenobarbital</b> (Phemiton) and primidone (Mysoline), since the major active metabolite of both drugs is phenobarbitai. The basis for our procedure is Goldbaum's method (Anal. Chem., 24, 1604 (1952)). This method was improved with several modifications including a single extraction technique with dichloroethane, which has produced a very simple but still accurate method. The whole analysis takes less than 20 minutes. This procedure is accurate in the range from 1 — 100 mg/ 1 of phenobarbitai in serum or cerebrospinal fluid.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of <b>methylphenobarbital</b> (MPB) and phenobarbital (PB) in plasma in two volunteers {{who were given}} continuous once-daily oral doses of MPB for 3 weeks was demonstrated by use of a selected ion-monitoring GC/MS assay. It was shown that the PB concentration exceeded the MPB concentration in plasma after about day 4, and that both barbiturates achieved plateau concen-trations after about 2 weeks. GC/MS studies on the urine of these volunteers permitted the identification of several new metabolites of MPB. These included 5 -ethyl- 5 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 1 -methylbarbi-turic acid (p-OH-MPB), and the 3 - 0 -methylcatechols of both MPB and PB. The meta-isomers of hydroxy-MPB and hydroxy-PB were identified in urine extracts, but were shown to be methodological artifacts. Quantitative studies, with use of a HPLC assay, were carried out for p-OH-MPB, PB and p-OH-PB In urine, and it was shown that these three substances collectively accounted for som...|$|E
40|$|The stereoselectlvfty of the {{metabolism}} and pharmacokinetics of <b>methylphenobarbital</b> (MPB) was studied in six healthy aduft male volunteers given single oral {{doses of the}} racemic drug. All of the vOlunteers were phenotypically extensive metabolizers of the drug. The R- and S-enantlomers of MPB were analyzed in plasma by an enantioselective HPLC method, and the enantiomers of the 4 -hy-droxy-MPB metabolfte in urine by a similar procedure. The (R>-MPB was extensively hydroxylated, {{with an average of}} 49. 56 % of that enantlomer being recovered In urine as (R) - 4 -hydroxy-MPB. Only 7. 16 % of the (S) -MPB was converted to the corresponding hydroxy metaboifte. The extensive hydroxylation of (R) -MPB resufted in rapid elimination of this enantiomer, with a terminal plasma half-lIfe of 7. 52 ± 1. 70 (SD) hr. The (S) -MPB, the only recognized metabolites of which were (S) - 4 -hydroxy-MPB and phenobarbftal (PB), was elimi-nated very slowly [t#{ 189 }, 69. 78 ± 14. 77 (SD) hr]. The oral clearance o...|$|E
40|$|The incidences {{of various}} {{complications}} during pregnancy are {{not significantly different}} between epileptic and nonepileptic mothers {{in the majority of}} papers so far reported. More than 70 to 80010 of women with epilepsy will have no change in seizure frequency, while 5010 will have fewer seizures than before and the remaining patients will have more seizures during pregnancy provided that their drug compliance is good. Intrauterine growth, in particular, of head circumference of fetus is delayed. However, this retardation disappears within few years after birth. The risk of congenital malformations of the offspring born to treated epileptic mothers is greater than in the general population. Among risk factors for teratogenesis that had been considered to date, only antiepileptic drug (AED) -related factors had proved to be significantly related to the occurrence of malformations. Among AEDs, <b>methylphenobarbital,</b> valproate, primidone, carbamazepine and phenytoin are teratogenic, particularly when they are used in combination. Follow up EEG of children born to epileptic mothers revealed that the incidence of abnormal EEG was 44010, and 28 to 38010 showed epileptiform patterns. Only 7010 of offspring had epileptic seizures. In the offspring without clinical seizures revealed that most of the epileptiform patterns disappear after the age 10. Recommendations concerning AED therapy during pregnancy are also discussed...|$|E
