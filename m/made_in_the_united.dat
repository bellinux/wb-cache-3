A wealthy man, often stated to be Michigan's first millionaire, E.B. Ward had holdings in Great Lakes steamships; lumbering at Ludington, Michigan; iron and steel manufacturing at Wyandotte, Michigan, Leland, Michigan, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Chicago, Illinois; and silver mining in Colorado. He manufactured the first Bessemer steel to be <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States at his plant in Wyandotte.

25|$|According to the United States government, {{the crew}} {{incorrectly}} identified the Iranian Airbus A300 as an attacking F-14A Tomcat fighter, a plane <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and operated {{at that time}} by only two forces worldwide, the United States Navy and the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force. While the Iranian F-14s had been supplied by manufacturer Grumman in an air-to-air configuration only in the 1970s, the crew of Vincennes had been briefed when entering the region that the Iranian F-14s carried unguided bombs as well as Maverick missiles and unguided rockets. The Vincennes crew made ten attempts to contact {{the crew of the}} flight on military and civilian radio frequencies, but received no response. The International Civil Aviation Organization said that the flight crew should have been monitoring the civilian frequency.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1864, work resumed again. Although Roebling {{operated}} his own wire mill at Trenton, New Jersey, the bridge company purchased one million pounds of wire from Richard Johnson at Manchester, England for the cables that would span {{the width of the}} river. Roebling had used Johnson's wire for one of his other bridges. He preferred it over wire <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States because it was of better quality and greater tensile strength. Anchorages on both shores were constructed of limestone base and a freestone finish. Eleven ton iron anchors were embedded in each block, securing cables with wrought iron chain links of Roebling's patent. These links resembled almost exactly the ones his son, Washington Roebling, would use {{in the construction of the}} Brooklyn Bridge. The Civil War depleted the work force on the project, hindering speed and efficiency until its end.|$|E
25|$|The first aircraft, F.300, {{made its}} first flight on 29 September 1931. The M.F. 11s were {{equipped}} with the British-designed Armstrong Siddeley Panther II radial engine, the first 14 of which were <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom. From 1934 license manufacturing of the Armstrong Siddeley Panther II began in Norway at Marinens Minevesen in Horten, with F.314 being the first aircraft equipped with a Norwegian-made engine. As the handmade Norwegian power plants were installed they soon proved to be of superior quality to the machine manufactured originals. The same engine was also produced for the Norwegian Army Air Service aircraft. A total of 17 Panther IIs were made in Norway, seven for Navy and ten for Army aircraft. The licence production ended in 1938 as import engines became freely available at a low cost after the Panther II was abandoned by the UK armed forces as it {{could no longer be}} used to propel the increasingly powerful British aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Munroe {{had then}} made a {{business}} out of making lead pencils. He made the graphite formula for his pencils in secret, with only {{the help of his}} wife. The business was quite successful. By 1814 he had made nearly 175,000 pencils, which sold for about six thousand dollars, a very large amount of money at the time. When the war with England ended there were better pencils available from Europe and his profits were erased by these better imports. Munroe figured it was pointless to try to compete against these superior products so took up his normal trade of cabinet-making. He also made tooth brushes and watchmaker's brushes, also the first <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. During this interim time {{he went back to the}} drawing board to do further experimenting with his secret lead pencil paste. One thing led to another until he came up with a powdered graphite paste product that would make its mark.|$|E
25|$|It was {{discovered}} that the United Kingdom sold arms to Sri Lanka worth over £13.6 million {{in the last three}} years of the conflict, contravening the 1998 Code of Conduct on Arms Exports by the European Union that restricts business with countries facing internal conflicts or with poor human rights records and a history of violating international law. Several members of parliament expressed anger at the development. Four committees in the House of Commons expressed concern in a joint statement that arms <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom were fired on civilians during battles in Sri Lanka. In their annual report, the cross-party committees on arms export controls recommended the government should review all arms exports to Sri Lanka following the crackdown on rebels. The MPs also questioned the government's commitment to tackling corruption and bribery and called on ministers to investigate what British-supplied military equipment was used in the campaign against the Tamils.|$|E

The river flow here is the principal factor in allocating water to the seven U.S. and two Mexican states in the Colorado River basin. The Colorado River Compact of 1922 apportioned an equal portion of the river's flow to the Upper Basin (the U.S. states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming and northern Arizona) and the Lower Basin (Arizona, California and Nevada), with the individual [...] "basins" [...] divided by an imaginary line at Lees Ferry.|$|E
