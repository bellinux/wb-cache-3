5|$|The heat {{needed for}} geyser {{formation}} comes from magma {{that needs to}} be near the surface of the earth. The fact that geysers need heat <b>much</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> normally found near the earth's surface is the reason they are associated with volcanoes or volcanic areas. The pressures encountered at the areas where the water is heated make the boiling point of the water <b>much</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> at normal atmospheric pressures.|$|E

5|$|The mean {{strontium}} {{content of}} ocean water is 8mg/l.

5|$|It {{is thought}} that {{the total amount of}} iridium in the planet Earth is <b>much</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> that {{observed}} in crustal rocks, but as with other platinum-group metals, the high density and tendency of iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still molten.|$|E

5|$|Mass {{estimates}} from the Voyager program missions suggested that Enceladus was composed {{almost entirely of}} water ice. However, based {{on the effects of}} Enceladus's gravity on Cassini, its mass was determined to be <b>much</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> previously thought, yielding a density of 1.61 g/cm3. This density is higher than Saturn's other mid-sized icy satellites, indicating that Enceladus contains a greater percentage of silicates and iron.|$|E
5|$|Tail {{feathers}} of the extinct huia are very rare {{and they have}} become a collectors' item. In June 2010 a single huia tail feather sold at auction in Auckland for NZ$8,000, <b>much</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the $500 the auctioneers had expected, making it the most expensive feather ever. The previous record price for a single feather was $US2,800 (NZ$4,000) achieved by a bald eagle feather at auction in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} {{field on the}} surface of Epsilon Eridani causes variations in the hydrodynamic behaviour of the photosphere. This results in greater jitter during measurements of its radial velocity. Variations of −1 were measured over a 20year period, which is <b>much</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the measurement uncertainty of −1. This makes interpretation of periodicities in the radial velocity of Epsilon Eridani, such as those caused by an orbiting planet, more difficult.|$|E

Wealthier citizens make use of private clinics. The risk of catching HIV in the city is reportedly high, and many truck drivers stopping in the city for sexual services pose a major risk of spreading the disease to other parts of the country. The risk of catching malaria in Bangui and pygmy camps is also <b>much</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> in the rest of the country.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{problems}} with the original design, in summer 1542 work recommenced on the castle, well after the initial invasion scare was over, lasting until August 1543. The decision to rectify the problems with the castle may have been taken by King Henry himself. Oxenbridge appears to have stayed on as the pay master and acted as the master of the works, with von Haschenperg remaining in his role as engineer almost {{until the end of the}} project, despite the difficulties with his earlier work. The cost of the second phase of work was <b>much</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the first, around £10,000.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{interaction}} with nearby stars and galactic tides modified cometary orbits {{to make them}} more circular. This explains the nearly spherical shape of the outer Oort cloud. On the other hand, the Hills cloud, which is bound more strongly to the Sun, has not acquired a spherical shape. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} formation of the Oort cloud is broadly compatible with the hypothesis that the Solar System formed as part of an embedded cluster of 200–400 stars. These early stars likely played a role in the cloud's formation, since the number of close stellar passages within the cluster was <b>much</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> today, leading to far more frequent perturbations.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} prevent a second running of the program it corrupts itself when run. The program simply overwrites itself with a 6000 byte long DNA-like code at a certain position. Archival {{documents}} suggest that the original plan was to use a series of ASCII 1's to corrupt the binary, {{but at some point}} in development a change was made to use fake genetic code, in keeping with the visual motifs in the book. The genetic code has a codon entropy of 5.97 bits/codon, <b>much</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> any natural DNA sequence known. However, the ciphertext was not overwritten.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 2012, Al Jazeera {{published}} {{the results of}} a nine-month investigation, which revealed that none of the causes of Arafat’s death suggested in several rumors could be true. Tests carried out by a Swiss scientific experts found traces of polonium in quantities <b>much</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> could occur naturally on Arafat's personal belongings. On 12 October 2013, the British medical journal The Lancet published a peer-reviewed article by the Swiss experts about the analysis of the 38 samples of Arafat's clothes and belongings and 37 reference samples which were known to be polonium-free, suggesting that Arafat could have died of polonium poisoning.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} piece of advice Yamamoto gave Kurosawa was that a good director needed to master screenwriting. Kurosawa soon realized that the potential earnings from his scripts were <b>much</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> what he was paid as an assistant director. Kurosawa would later write or co-write all of his own films. He also frequently wrote screenplays for other directors such as for the antiwar film director Satsuo Yamamoto's film, A Triumph of Wings (Tsubasa no gaika, 1942). This outside scriptwriting would serve Kurosawa as a lucrative sideline lasting well into the 1960s, long after he became world-famous.|$|E
