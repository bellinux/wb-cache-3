40|$|A new {{generation}} of storage ring-based light source, called diffraction-limited storage ring (DLSR), with emittance approaching the diffraction limit for multi-keV photons by means of <b>multi-bend</b> achromat lattice, has attracted worldwide and extensive studies. Among various DLSR proposals, the hybrid <b>multi-bend</b> achromat concept developed at ESRF predicts an effective way of minimizing the emittance and meanwhile keeping the required sextupole strengths to an achievable level. For the High Energy Photon Source planned {{to be built in}} Beijing, an ESRF-type lattice design consisting of 48 hybrid seven-bend achromats is proposed to reach emittance as low as 60 pm. rad with a circumference of about 1296 m. Sufficient dynamic aperture promising vertical on-axis injection and moderate momentum acceptance are achieved simultaneously for a promising ring performance.

40|$|Abstract—Ultrasonic guided {{waves in}} pipes {{have been used}} as a {{powerful}} and effective tool for long-range inspection of pipes as they have the potential of propagating long distances with little attenuation. The propagation phenomena of guided waves in straight pipes have been investigated by many researchers; however, the propagation of guided waves across features such as bends in the pipe network is still not well understood. In order to study the complicated characteristics of guided waves propagating in <b>multi-bends</b> pipe, experiment on detecting <b>multi-bends</b> pipe using guided wave was conducted based on magnetostrictive sensors. Guided wave properties such as propagation speed, mode conversion, energy attenuation were studied in experiment.

40|$|In {{the design}} of a diffraction-limited storage ring (DLSR) {{consisting}} of compact <b>multi-bend</b> achromats (MBAs), it is challenging to simultaneously achieve an ultralow emittance and a satisfactory nonlinear performance, due to extremely large nonlinearities and limited tuning ranges of the element parameters. Nevertheless, taking the High Energy Photon Source (HEPS) as an example, we demonstrate that the potential of a DLSR design can be explored with a successive and iterative implementation of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). It turns out that with a hybrid MBA lattice, it is feasible for the HEPS to attain a natural emittance of about 50 pm. rad, and meanwhile, realize a sufficient ring acceptance for beam accumulation with an on-axis longitudinal injection scheme. Particularly, this study indicates that a rational combination of the PSO and MOGA is more effective than either of them alone in approaching the true global optima, for an explorative multi-objective problem with many optimizing variables and local optima.

30|$|A new {{generation}} of microscopes are being pioneered, commissioned, and planned at several US Department of Energy (DOE) user facilities [4 – 6] and elsewhere to achieve superior resolution and contrast in three dimensions, encompassing a macroscopic field of view and chemical or magnetic sensitivity, by coupling together the brightest sources of tunable X-rays, nanometer positioning, nanofocusing lenses, and faster detectors. Existing soft X-ray detector technology in use at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) for example generates 350 MBytes/s per instrument [7]; commercial detectors for hard X-rays can record 6 GB/s or raw data per detector  [8, 9], and a synchrotron light source can support 40 or more experiments simultaneously 24 hours a day. Accelerator technologies such as <b>multi-bend</b> achromat [10] are poised to increase brightness by two orders of magnitude around the globe  [11, 12]. Next generation microscopes may exploit multi-color sources, increased detector parallelism, increased frame rate, or stroboscopic structured illumination to extract higher-dimensional, higher resolution, higher frame-rate characterization of a specimen.

40|$|The Advanced Photon Source is in {{the process}} of up-grading its storage ring from a double-bend to a <b>multi-bend</b> lattice as part of the APS Upgrade Project (APS-U).

A novel concept that cancels out the effect of leakage field inside the stored beam chamber was introduced in the design of the septum magnet. As a result, the horizontal deflecting angle of the stored beam was reduced to below 1 micro-rad with a 2 mm septum thick-ness and 1. 06 T normal injection field. The concept helped to minimize the integrated skew quadrupole field and normal sextupole fields inside stored beam chamber as well.

40|$|Not {{very long}} ago, the 3 rd {{generation}} storage ring technology {{was judged as}} mature. Most of the 3 rd generation storage rings used the Double-Bend Achromat (DBA) or Triple-Bend Achromat (TBA) concepts. It was however a well-known fact that {{increasing the number of}} magnet cells in the rings is a powerful way of decreasing the electron beam emittance and thus the source brilliance, but at the penalty of increasing the size and cost of the rings. Preserving the Dynamic Aperture (DA) in the rings became also an issue when increasing the number of magnet cells. The <b>Multi-Bend</b> Achromat (MBA) concept, including a miniaturization of the ring elements, has now drastically changed the picture. The MBA rings, now in construction or being planned, offer orders of magnitudes higher brilliance than rings of conventional designs. Several light sources around the world are now implementing or planning to implement this MBA concept. This article touches on the science drivers for higher brilliance. We will then describe the MBA concept with its advantages as well as its challenges. A short survey of the MBA activity around the world will also be presented.

40|$|The MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring, {{currently}} under construction, pursues {{the goal of}} low electron beam emittance by using a <b>multi-bend</b> achromat magnet lattice, which is realised by having several consecutive magnet elements precision-machined out of a common solid iron block, 2. 3 - 3. 4 m long. With this magnet design solution, instead of having 1320 individual magnets, the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring is built up using 140 integrated `magnet block' units, containing all these magnet elements. Major features of this magnet block design are compactness, vibration stability and that the alignment of magnet elements within each unit is given by the mechanical accuracy of the CNC machining rather than individual field measurement and adjustment. This article presents practical engineering details of implementing this magnet design solution, and mechanical + magnetic field measurement results from the magnet production series. At the time of writing (spring 2014), the production series, which is totally outsourced to industry, is roughly half way through, with mechanical/magnetic QA conforming to specifications.

40|$|We {{report on}} high {{resolution}} measurements of resonances in {{the spectrum of}} coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) at the Canadian Light Source (CLS). The resonances permeate the spectrum at wavenumber intervals of 0. 074 cm^- 1, and are highly stable under changes in the machine setup (energy, bucket filling pattern, CSR in bursting or continuous mode). Analogous resonances were predicted long ago in an idealized theory as eigenmodes of a smooth toroidal vacuum chamber driven by a bunched beam moving on a circular orbit. A corollary of peaks in the spectrum {{is the presence of}} pulses in the wakefield of the bunch at well defined spatial intervals. Through experiments and further calculations we elucidate the resonance and wakefield mechanisms in the CLS vacuum chamber, which has a fluted form much different from a smooth torus. The wakefield is observed directly in the 30 - 110 GHz range by RF diodes, and indirectly by an interferometer in the THz range. The wake pulse sequence found by diodes is less regular than in the toroidal model, and depends on the point of observation, but is accounted for in a simulation of fields in the fluted chamber. Attention is paid to polarization of the observed fields, and possible coherence of fields produced in adjacent bending magnets. Low frequency wakefield production appears to be mainly local in a single bend, but <b>multi-bend</b> effects cannot be excluded entirely, and could play a role in high frequency resonances. New simulation techniques have been developed, which should be invaluable in further work. Comment: 5 figures.

40|$|Within research, {{synchrotron}} radiation {{is a highly}} useful probe {{for the study of}} materials, their properties and structures. Currently, no other radiation source allows the combination of high intensity and short wavelengths. The 3 rd generation light sources currently in use for the production of {{synchrotron radiation}} are however considerable investments: for already existing facilities this makes it important to ensure high operational reliability as well as good performance. For facilities in planning, such as the MAX IV light source, extensive design studies are of essence to meet target performance. The main subject of this thesis is the performance, characterisation and tuning of the existing MAX II and MAX III light sources at the MAX-laboratory, one of two national research facilities in Sweden. The MAX II storage ring, in operation since 1995, was characterised using response matrix analysis, bunch spectrum analysis and transverse beam profile measurement. In particular, some at the time of building unconventional technology solutions were evaluated: combined quadrupole-sextupole magnets, non-zero dispersion in straight sections and common girders for all magnets in one cell. The MAX III storage ring, commissioned in 2007 and starting synchrotron radiation production in late 2008, was characterised using response matrix and bunch spectrum analysis. Further, measurements were carried out of the betatron tunes, chromaticities, beam lifetime, magnets, pole-face strips as well as the RF parameters. Accurate characterisation of MAX III served dual purposes: improvement of MAX III performance and evaluation of new accelerator technology intended also for the MAX IV project. Initial MAX III operational experience showed that the dipole magnets used for orbit correction frequently saturated. To remedy this problem, the ring was realigned using the beam as a reference. The data required was the corrector magnet strengths. The thesis also encompasses some Intrabeam Scattering studies for two versions of a prototype <b>multi-bend</b> achromat lattice: a 12 cell and a 20 cell version.
