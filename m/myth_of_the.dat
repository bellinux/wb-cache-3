5|$|By the mid-1950s, HIAG {{established}} {{an image that}} separated the Waffen-SS from other SS formations and shifted responsibility for crimes {{that could not be}} denied to the Allgemeine-SS (security and police), the SS-Totenkopfverbände and the Einsatzgruppen. The Waffen-SS was thus successfully integrated into the <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clean Wehrmacht.|$|E
5|$|According to the Shumbha-Nishumbha <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Devi Mahatmya {{from the}} Markandeya Purana {{religious}} texts, the Matrikas goddesses appears as shaktis (feminine powers) from {{the bodies of}} the gods. The scriptures say that Varahi was created from Varaha. She has a boar form, wields a chakra (discus) and fights with a sword. After the battle described in the scripture, the Matrikas dancedrunk on their victim's blood.|$|E

5|$|Both {{civilian}} and military authorities considered the Wehrmachtbericht to be a vital instrument of German home-front mobilisation, the civilian contribution to the German war effort, especially after the defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad. According to historians Wolfram Wette and Daniel Uziel, the final 9 May 1945 communiqué {{laid the foundation for}} the <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clean Wehrmacht, the notion that the Wehrmacht had fought honourably and was not implicated in the crimes of the Nazi regime, for which (according to the myth) only the SS bore responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Fragments 2 and 3, giving {{accounts}} of Jesus' baptism and temptation or transfiguration, {{spring from the}} widespread Greco-Roman <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> descent of divine Wisdom; this underlies the parallel passages in the gospels of Matthew(11.25–30), Luke(7.18–35 and 11.49–51) and John(1.1–18), {{as well as the}} Gospel of Thomas. The differences between fragment 3 and the orthodox canonical gospels are considerable: their third-person narrative has become an account by Jesus himself, Satan is replaced by the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is identified as Jesus' mother.|$|E
5|$|In {{between the}} Argo and the Trojan War, {{there was a}} {{generation}} known chiefly for its horrific crimes. This includes the doings of Atreus and Thyestes at Argos. Behind the <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house of Atreus (one of the two principal heroic dynasties with the house of Labdacus) lies {{the problem of the}} devolution of power and of the mode of accession to sovereignty. The twins Atreus and Thyestes with their descendants played the leading role in the tragedy of the devolution of power in Mycenae.|$|E

5|$|Irving's {{writings}} on Columbus are {{a mixture of}} history and fiction, a genre now called romantic history. Irving based them on extensive research in the Spanish archives, but also added imaginative elements aimed at sharpening the story. The first of these works {{is the source of}} the durable myth that medieval Europeans believed the Earth was flat. (See <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flat earth.) According to the popular book, Columbus proved the Earth was round.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Fontenrose wrote Orion : the <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hunter and the Huntress (1981) to show Orion as {{the type}} {{specimen}} {{of a variety}} of grotesque hero. Fontenrose views him as similar to Cúchulainn, that is, stronger, larger, and more potent than ordinary men and the violent lover of the Divine Huntress; other heroes of the same type are Actaeon, Leucippus (son of Oenomaus), Cephalus, Teiresias, and Zeus as the lover of Callisto. Fontenrose also sees Eastern parallels in the figures of Aqhat, Attis, Dumuzi, Gilgamesh, Dushyanta, and Prajapati (as pursuer of Ushas).|$|E
5|$|Morris had {{continued}} to devote much time to writing poetry. In 1867 Bell and Dandy published Morris's epic poem, The Life and Death of Jason, at his own expense. The book was a retelling of the ancient Greek <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hero Jason and his quest to find the Golden Fleece. In contrast to Morris's former publication, The Life and Death of Jason was well received, resulting in the publishers paying Morris a fee for the second edition.|$|E

5|$|The walrus {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the religion and folklore of many Arctic peoples. Skin and bone are used in some ceremonies, and the animal appears frequently in legends. For example, in a Chukchi version of the widespread <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Raven, in which Raven recovers the sun and the moon from an evil spirit by seducing his daughter, the angry father throws the daughter from a high cliff and, as she drops into the water, she turns into a walrus – possibly the original walrus. According to various legends, the tusks are formed either by the trails of mucus from the weeping girl or her long braids. This myth is possibly related to the Chukchi <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old walrus-headed woman who rules the bottom of the sea, who is in turn linked to the Inuit goddess Sedna. Both in Chukotka and Alaska, the aurora borealis is believed to be a special world inhabited by those who died by violence, the changing rays representing deceased souls playing ball with a walrus head.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} media, {{newspapers}} were {{controlled by the}} state, with the Reich Press Chamber shutting down or buying newspapers and publishing houses. By 1939, over {{two thirds of the}} newspapers and magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry. The NSDAP daily newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter ("Ethnic Observer"), was edited by Alfred Rosenberg, author of The <b>Myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Twentieth Century, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority. Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. His propaganda ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely. Newspaper readership plummeted, partly because of the decreased quality of the content and partly because of the surge in popularity of radio.|$|E
5|$|At the Middle Preclassic city of Nakbe in {{the central}} lowlands, Maya sculptors were {{producing}} {{some of the earliest}} lowland Maya stelae, depicting richly dressed individuals. Nakbe Stela1 has been dated to around 400BC. It was broken into pieces, but originally represented two elaborately dressed figures facing each other, and perhaps represents the transference of power from one ruler to his successor, however it also has features that recall the <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maya Hero Twins, and would be the earliest known presentation of them. Around 200BC the enormous nearby city of ElMirador had started to erect stela-like monuments, bearing inscriptions that appear to be glyphs but that are so far unreadable. Stela dating to the Late Preclassic period are also known from the sites of El Tintal, Cival, and San Bartolo in Guatemala, and Actuncan and Cahal Pech in Belize.|$|E

5|$|In Greek mythology, Taurus was {{identified}} with Zeus, who assumed {{the form of}} a magnificent white bull to abduct Europa, a legendary Phoenician princess. In illustrations of Greek mythology, only the front portion of this constellation are depicted; this was sometimes explained as Taurus being partly submerged as he carried Europa out to sea. A second Greek myth portrays Taurus as Io, a mistress of Zeus. To hide his lover from his wife Hera, Zeus changed Io into {{the form of a}} heifer. Greek mythographer Acusilaus marks the bull Taurus as the same that formed the <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cretan Bull, one of The Twelve Labors of Heracles.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} when cacti were first cultivated. Opuntias (prickly pears) were used {{for a variety of}} {{purposes}} by the Aztecs, whose empire, lasting from the 14th to the 16th century, had a complex system of horticulture. Their capital from the 15th century was Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City); one explanation for the origin of the name is that it includes the Nahuatl word nōchtli, referring to the fruit of an opuntia. The coat of arms of Mexico shows an eagle perched on a cactus while holding a snake, an image {{at the center of the}} <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> founding of Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs symbolically linked the ripe red fruits of an opuntia to human hearts; just as the fruit quenches thirst, so offering human hearts to the sun god ensured the sun would keep moving.|$|E
5|$|Monteverdi's next {{commission}} from Mantua {{came early}} in 1618, {{when he was}} asked to provide the music for Andromeda, an opera based on the ancient Greek <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> princess chained to a rock. The libretto was written by Duke Ferdinando's chancellor, Ercole Marigliani, and the project was sponsored by the duke's younger brother, Don Vincenzo Gonzaga. It is probable that the work was intended for performance at the Mantua Carnival of March 1618, but as Carter records, Monteverdi's approach to his Mantua commissions was often dilatory and half-hearted; his inability or unwillingness to work on Andromeda delayed its performance, first to 1619 and then to 1620.|$|E

5|$|Mythology and {{folklore}} often {{exaggerate the}} skills of famous gunfighters. Most of these historical figures were not known {{to be capable of}} trick shooting, nor did they necessarily have a reputation for precision sharpshooting. Such tropes that are frequently seen in Westerns include shooting the center of a coin, stylistic pistol twirling, glancing shots that intentionally only graze an opponent (the bullet through the hat being an example), shooting an opponent's belt buckle (thus dropping his pants), a bullet cutting the hangman's rope, or shooting the guns out of opponents' hands (typically as an alternative to killing). The latter was debunked by Mythbusters as an impossibility, as unjacketed bullets tend to shatter into fragments that can hurt or even kill. Ed McGivern dispelled the <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inaccuracy of pistol fanning by shooting tight groups while fanning the revolver.|$|E
5|$|Spiders are {{depicted}} in Indigenous Australian art, in rock and bark paintings, and for clan totems. Spiders in their webs {{are associated with}} a sacred rock in central Arnhem Land on the Burnungku clan estate of the Rembarrnga/Kyne people. Their totem design is connected with a major regional ceremony, providing a connection with neighboring clans also having spider totems in their rituals. Nareau, the Lord Spider, created the universe, according to the traditional Cosmology of Oceania's Kiribati islanders of the Tungaru archipelago (Gilbert Islands); similarly, Areop-Enap ("Old Spider") plays an important part in the creation <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional Nauru islanders of Micronesia. In the Philippines, there is a Visayan folk tale version of The Spider and the Fly which explains why the spider hates the fly.|$|E
5|$|Steady losses had {{occurred}} throughout {{their participation in}} the battle. On 18 August, known as the Hardest Day because both sides suffered heavy losses, the Stuka was withdrawn after 16 were destroyed and many others damaged. According to the Generalquartiermeister der Luftwaffe, 59 Stukas had been destroyed and 33 damaged to varying degrees in six weeks of operations. Over 20% of the total Stuka strength had been lost between 8 and 18 August; and the <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stuka shattered. The Ju 87s did succeed in sinking six warships, 14 merchant ships, badly damaging seven airfields and three Chain Home radar stations, and destroying 49 British aircraft, mainly on the ground.|$|E
