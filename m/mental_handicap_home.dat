40|$|Calcineurin, a Ca 2 +- Calmodulin {{dependent}} protein phosphatase, {{is important}} for Ca 2 + mediated signal transduction. The main objective {{of this study was}} to examine the potential role of calcineurin in idiopathic <b>mental</b> <b>handicap.</b> Calcineurin levels were estimated in 20 children in the age group of 5 - 16 years with idiopathic <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> attending the Special Education Centre for the Mentally Handicapped in Hyderabad. The results of the present study showed decreased activity of serum calcineurin in children with idiopathic <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> compared to those of normal subjects in the same age group. The observations thus suggest impaired calcineurin activity in children with <b>mental</b> <b>handicap.</b> Calcineurin that is involved in biosynthesis and release of neurotransmitters at the synaptic terminal brain is affected thereby causing brain damage and leading to <b>mental</b> <b>handicap.</b> Impaired calcineurin activity was already indicated in many human diseases such as Downâ€™s syndrome, Alzheimers, Brain ischemia, cardiac hypertrophy etc. It is therefore necessary to check the calcineurin levels in children with <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> to understand the role of calcineurin in the causation of <b>Mental</b> <b>handicap...</b>|$|R
40|$|A new community-focused <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> {{service was}} started in a single-district area health {{authority}} in 1974. Almost 90 % of all the severely mentally handicapped people in a population of 250, 000 are now known to the service. Although two-thirds of long stay inpatients originally admitted with major behavioural problems have had them resolved, the remaining one-third with persisting problems are noted to have spent many years in large understaffed wards before transfer. Specialist services to mentally handicapped people are not synonymous with beds. The learning opportunities during the waking hours of a mentally handicapped person are where professional help must be concentrated, and extensive support services for those caring for the mentally <b>handicapped</b> at <b>home</b> must be set up. Absence of shared philosophies, policies, and planning among the health and local authorities has produced the problems and frustrations familiar to many professionals in <b>mental</b> <b>handicap.</b> Future developments {{must be based on}} clearly defined and declared principles...|$|R

It is noted that the definition of community integration has developed as the provision of community-based alternatives to traditional institutions has proceeded.

Research findings generally validate the development of community provisions in the place of long-stay hospitals.

40|$|This {{paper is}} in two parts. The first part reviews the {{available}} literature describing sleep patterns {{of people with}} <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> and the nature and prevalence of sleep disorders amongst this client group. Both electroencephalographic studies and informant-based reports are included. The literature is small, particularly {{in terms of the}} latter reports, and most of the information from both E. E. G. and informant sources describes populations of children with <b>mental</b> <b>handicap.</b> The need for further investigation of sleep and sleep problems, particularly amongst adults with <b>mental</b> <b>handicap,</b> therefore, becomes evident. The second part presents the results of a detailed sleep survey of 120 adults with <b>mental</b> <b>handicap,</b> approximately half of whom were resident in hospital and half in the community. A descriptive summary of the total sample is provided. Fifteen per cent of the sample presented significant sleep problems, particularly in the form of intermittent wakenings. The results of comparisons between (1) good and poor sleepers (2) hospital and community residents and (3) people with <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> and 'normal' adults (using data from another study) are then presented. The relationships between sleep and daytime functioning and the potential usefulness of behavioural approaches to management of sleep pattern are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{the number}} of {{children}} with a slight form of <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> who attend the ordinary state pre-schools has grown. In the thesis, I have tried to compare the outcomes of their work with the outcomes of their mates with no special needs. The outcomes have been evaluated through the Mathematics curriculum. The theoretical part of the thesis deals with the presentation of the children with a slight form of <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> who are given some extra professional help during their stay at the pre-school special needs programme. I was particularly interested in the temporal and spatial adaptations as well as the adaptations of activities that these children are involved into. The empirical part of the thesis deals with the results of the mathematical tests given to eleven children including a child with a slight form of <b>mental</b> <b>handicap.</b> The results of all eleven children have been compared. Additionally, the results achieved by the child with the slight form of <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> have been analyzed separately and compared with the results of his mates with no special needs. The given results in the field of Mathematics show that the child with the slight form of <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> is not much different from his mates with no special needs. The results differ considerably only in the field of orientation. Elsewhere there is no considerable deviation. According to my field research, I can sum up, there are no considerable differences in the analyzed outcomes between a child with a slight form of <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> and his mates with no special needs at least in the field of mathematics. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{that there}} has been an {{increasing}} number of people with disabilities entering the world of work with assistance from supported employment programmes, little research has been directed at investigating the quality of workplace integration of people with <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> in the local context. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the workplace interaction of people with <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> who had obtained a job with assistance from supported employment programmes in Hong Kong. Five young adults with mild <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> participated in in-depth interviews concerning their workplace interactions. Content analysis and constant comparative methods were used to analyse the data. Findings reveal that the participantsâ€™ levels of workplace interaction were affected by two factors: personal and external. The personal factors included the participantsâ€™ levels of social competence and individual preference; while the external factors include the job nature, the company policy and support from people in the workplace. These findings suggest that strategies aimed at improving group interaction skills, promoting self-determination, and involving support would enable people with <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> to have more workplace integration.

40|$|Recently {{professionals}} and service planners {{have become increasingly}} aware {{of the consequences of}} stigma and of limited social experience for the self-concepts of people with a <b>mental</b> <b>handicap.</b> These issues have been central to the debate concerning the mainstreaming of children with special needs in ordinary schools and have become of major importance for those promoting the social integration of people with a <b>mental</b> <b>handicap.</b> However, there is little understanding {{of the relationship between the}} person's experience of stigma and his or her self-concept. Researchers have studied the self-concepts of people with a <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> using normative or standardised tests which produce quantitative scores. I argue that such studies provide little insight into 'handicapped' treatment and the participants' views of themselves. In contrast to these studies, the present research has followed the work of Edgerton (1967), who used intensive methods to study the relationship between the self-concepts of adult people with a <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> and their social circumstances. Three groups of adult people with a mild <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> took part in this research. The first group lived in their family home, the second group moved from their family home to liye more independently, and the third group came from a long-stay hospital. The instruments used in the research were open-ended interviews. In total 48 participants with a mild <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> were interviewed, and where possible, their mothers and staff were also involved. The interviews concerned the participants' experience of stigma and their views of themselves in relation to handicap and stigma. A longitudinal investigation with a sub-sample of the participants was also carried out to explore their pattern of social lives and networks. It was found that participants led socially rather segregated lives, had considerable experience of stigma and were often regarded by significant others in their lives as 'handicapped' as persons. Despite this, most of the participants in each of the three groups rejected a 'handicapped' identity. These findings are discussed with reference to several social theories of the self and previous research. The practical implications of the results for future policy and services for people with a <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> are also considered...|$|R
