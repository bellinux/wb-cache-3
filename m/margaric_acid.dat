Subjects {{of the present study}} consisted of 80 neuroleptic-naïve UHR patients. Partial correlation coefficients were calculated between baseline erythrocyte membrane FA levels, measured by gas chromatography, and scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) after controlling for age, sex, smoking and cannabis use. Subjects were divided into three groups according to the predominance of positive or negative symptoms based on PANSS subscale scores; membrane FA levels in the three groups were then compared. More severe negative symptoms measured by PANSS were negatively correlated with two saturated FAs (myristic and <b>margaric</b> <b>acids),</b> one ω- 9 monounsaturated FA (MUFA; nervonic acid), and one ω- 3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA; docosapentaenoic acid), and were positively correlated with two ω- 9 MUFAs (eicosenoic and erucic acids) and two ω- 6 PUFAs (γ-linolenic and docosadienoic acids). More severe positive symptoms measured by PANSS were correlated only with nervonic acid. No associations were observed between FAs and MADRS scores. In subjects with predominant negative symptoms, the sum of the ω- 9 MUFAs and the ω- 6 :ω- 3 FA ratio were both significantly higher than in those with predominant positive symptoms, whereas the sum of ω- 3 PUFAs was significantly lower. In conclusion, abnormalities in FA metabolism may contribute to the neurobiology of psychopathology in UHR individuals.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{in the north}} of Tuscany along the Apennine ridge, mainly in Pistoia, Prato and Florence districts, it is {{recording}} an increase of red deer number and, therefore, an increasing quantity of derived meat. It is well known that, generally, venison contains less fat than traditional red meats, satisfying consumer demand for lean meat, but less are the knowledge about meat fatty acid profile. Therefore, from the carcasses of ten stags, shot during the last 2009 - 2010 hunting season at an age of 18 - 20 months, ten samples of longissimus lumborum were excised at the level of 7 th- 8 th ribs to determine pHu values (pHmeter Hanna pH 211) and fatty acid profile (by gas-chromatography after Folch extraction). pHu values are normal (5. 7 - 5. 8) indicating a good acidification of meat and no effect of stress due to hunting method. Meat fatty acid composition shows values similar to other authors on red deer: total saturated content (lauric, myristic, palmitic, <b>margaric</b> and stearic <b>acids)</b> is equal to 42. 08 %; total monounsaturated (myristoleic, palmitoleic, cis-heptadecanoic, oleic and cis-eicosenoic acids) is equal to 26. 04 %, while polyunsaturated ones (linoleic, α-linoleic, CLA, arachidonic, EPA, DPA, DHA) are equal to 31. 88 %.

40|$|The results {{obtained}} for the cross-sectional areas of the series of long-chain fatty acids may best be summarized {{with the aid of}} Graph 9. This graphical representation of the molecular areas, in Å², against the chain length (n), of the fatty acid molecules, illustrates variation of the areas with chain length for the series in recrystallized form, and also for selected samples in the zone purified and vacuum distilled forms. On the graph, the limits of variation of the molecular areas have been represented as lines of a length corresponding to twice the standard deviation (2 S). This is to give representation that the standard deviation may be positive or negative in relation to the mean. For molecules with n odd and lying between 15 and 19, the molecular area decreases. This {{may be due to the}} effect of 3 factorsg (1) A general decrease in lateral translation because of the increasing molecular mass (translational kinetic energy per molecule = ½ mc ⁻²), resulting in closer spacing of molecules. (2) A general, but steady decrease in the angle of tilt of the molecules which thus tend to be held more erect in the condensed film. (3) A general decrease in the precessional motion of the hydrophobic chain groups. For molecules with n odd and between 19 and 23, the molecular areas increase probably due to the steady increase in molecular mass causing the long chains to commence to buckle, tilt or topple in their upper regions. This tilting becomes greater because of the increasing gravitational effect on the heavier molecules which tends to make them assume a flatter posture in relation to the surface. The lower values observed for <b>margaric</b> and nonadecanoic <b>acids,</b> may be due to increasing symmetry in the chain, with corresponding economy in packing in condensed monolayers. This effect may be connected with increasing cylindrical symmetry of the hydrocarbon chain for even values of n. The results of this investigution, incomplete as it is, - serve to indicate what might reasonably be expected to happen in the orientation of these fatty acids in monolayers. Further work, especially on a greater range of acids with even n, is clearly necessary in order to establish the tentative ideas which have been suggested. However, in the present research, work was limited to those acids in the series which were obtainable without undue difficulty or delay, those which would spread readily under the conditions of experiments carried out at 20 °C, and those which could be purified relatively easily. The acids below n = 15 in the series were found to be too soluble in aqueous substrates, at operating temperatures of 20 °C, to yield reliable evidence with the Langmuir trough technique. The acids above n = 23 were unobtainable commercially and the synthesis of those acids from the lower members in the series presented problems of isolating the required specimens and difficulty in purifying these, which were considered b be beyond the scope of the present research.

Okra has different uses as a food and a remedy in traditional medicine. Since it producesmany seeds, distribution of the plant is also quite easy. Although seed oil yield is low (4. 7 %), since the linoleic acid composition of the seed oil is quiet high (67. 5 %), it can still {{be used as a}} source of (UNSAT) unsaturated fatty acids. In this study, samples of okra grown in four different locations were analyzed to measure fatty acid and amino acid compositions. The content of the lipid extraction ranged from 4. 34 % to 4. 52 % on a dry weight basis. Quantitatively, the main okra fatty acids were palmitic acid (29. 18 – 43. 26 %), linoleic acid (32. 22 – 43. 07 %), linolenic acid (6. 79 – 12. 34 %), stearic acid (6. 36 – 7. 73 %), oleic acid (4. 31 – 6. 98 %), arachidic acid (ND– 3. 48 %), <b>margaric</b> <b>acid</b> (1. 44 – 2. 16 %), pentadecylic acid (0. 63 – 0. 92 %), and myristic acid (0. 21 – 0. 49 %). Aspartic acid, proline, and glutamic acids were the main amino acids in okra pods, while cysteine and tyrosine were the minor amino acids. Statistical methods revealed how the fatty acid and amino acid contents in okra may be affected by the sampling location. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate effects of feeding monensin (MON) or a multivalent polyclonal antibody preparation (PAP) against several rumen microorganisms on feedlot performance, carcass characteristics, blood gas profile, and rumenitis of Bos indicus biotype (BT) yearling bulls. The study was designed as a completely randomized design with a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement, replicated 4 times, in which 32 yearling bulls of each of 3 BT evaluated (3 -way-cross, TC; Canchim, CC; and Nellore, NE) were fed diets containing either MON at 300 mg. d(- 1) or PAP at 10 mL. d(- 1) across 3 different periods. No significant (P > 0. 10) feed additive (FA) main effects were observed for any of the feedlot performance variables and carcass characteristics with the exception of dressing percentage. Yearling bulls receiving PAP had a decreased (P = 0. 047) dressing percentage when compared with yearling bulls receiving MON. Significant (P 0. 10) for any of the fatty acids measured in the subcutaneous adipose tissue, with the exception that yearling bulls receiving MON had greater (P < 0. 05) concentrations of palmitic acid (16 : 0), <b>margaric</b> <b>acid</b> (17 : 0), docosapentaenoic acid (22 : 5), and docosahexaenoic acid (22 : 6) than those yearling bulls receiving PAP. Feeding PAP tended to decrease incidence of rumen lesions and led to similar feedlot performance compared with feeding MON. Thus, PAP is a new technology that presents a possible alternative for ionophores.

The synthesized samples have been used to physical and electrochemical characterization such as thermo gravimetric analysis (TG/DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electrochemical characterization viz., electrochemical galvanostatic cycling studies, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and differential capacity curves (dQ/dE). XRD patterns of LiMn 2 O 4 and LiCuxAlyMn 2 −x−yO 4 confirm high degree of crystallinitywith better phase purity of synthesized materials. FESEM images of parent LiMn 2 O 4 depict the most of the particles that are in 0. 5 μm while LiCu 0. 5 Al 0. 05 Mn 1. 45 O 4 powders exhibiting ice-cube surface morphology with good agglomerated less particle size of 50 nm. TEM images of spinel LiMn 2 O 4 and LiCu 0. 5 Al 0. 05 Mn 1. 45 O 4 corroborate that all the synthesized particles are nano-sized with uniformspherical and cloudy particlemorphology.
