30|$|An 83 -year-old man was {{diagnosed}} with type 3 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (T 3 N 1 M 0, cStage IIIA, UICC- 7), spreading from the lower thoracic esophagus to the abdominal esophagus. He underwent thoracoscopic esophagectomy with a two-field lymph node dissection followed by substernal gastric tube reconstruction. The final diagnosis was <b>moderately</b> <b>differentiated</b> squamous <b>cell</b> carcinoma (T 3 N 2 M 0, fStage IIIB). Adjuvant chemotherapy was not administered because of the advanced age and postoperative condition of the patient. Computed tomography (CT) at 14  months postoperatively showed a mass with a 2 -cm diameter at the right adrenal gland. Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT revealed a high fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the mass. It was suspected that the mass was a metastatic lesion secondary to the primary esophageal carcinoma. No metastases to lymph nodes or other distant organs were identified. The patient underwent laparoscopic right adrenalectomy. The histopathological examination revealed <b>moderately</b> <b>differentiated</b> squamous <b>cell</b> carcinoma, suggesting metastasis from the primary esophageal carcinoma. He has survived without recurrence for 38  months since laparoscopic adrenalectomy to remove the right adrenal metastastic mass after the esophageal carcinoma surgery.|$|R

40|$|Background: Orofacial {{tumors are}} tumors {{that can affect}} any tissue in the oral and maxillofacial region. They {{constitute}} a major health problem in Africa because of late presentation. Aim: This was a retrospective study designed to determine the pattern of histologically diagnosed orofacial tumor and those actually managed. Materials and Methods: The department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Oral Pathology of a University Teaching Hospital in South West Nigeria. Histological diagnoses file and theater register booklet was retrieved from 2010 to 2014. Age, sex, diagnosis, and occupation of the patients were extracted. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16 (SPSS 16 Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results were presented as descriptive frequencies (%). The value of P < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Of the 188 data analyzed, 98 (52. 1 %) were females, whereas 90 (47. 9 %) were males with male: female ratio 1 : 1. 08. Age groups 21 – 30 and 31 – 40 constitute the highest age group with tumor presentation (41 [21. 8 %]). Most of the patients were traders (62 [33 %]). Plexiform ameloblastoma {{was the most common}} benign tumor (23 [12. 2 %]), whereas <b>moderately</b> <b>differentiated</b> squamous <b>cell</b> carcinoma was the most common malignant tumor (9 [4. 8 %]). Only 58 (30. 9 %) were treated while 91 (48. 4 %) were not treated and only 39 (20. 7 %) were referred. Conclusion: Ameloblastoma was the most common odontogenic tumor while <b>moderately</b> <b>differentiated</b> squamous <b>cell</b> carcinoma was the most common malignant lesion. Most of the diagnosed tumors were not treated and reason is due to low financial status of the patients. Negligence on the part of patient could also be a contributing factor...|$|R

Laboratory examinations showed leukocytosis (9, 530 /μl) {{and high levels of}} serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19 - 9, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Ultrasonography and computed tomography demonstrated a solitary tumor in the right lobe of the liver, and the gallbladder was not detected. A needle biopsy specimen of the liver tumor revealed <b>moderately</b> <b>differentiated</b> adenocarcinoma and we diagnosed suspected gallbladder carcinoma with liver infiltration. Fever of 37 ℃ to 38. 5 ℃ persisted from 5 days after transfer and the leukocyte count in the peripheral blood increased to a maximum of 3. 7 x 10 ^ 4 /μl during observation.

40|$|Background: The oral mucosa {{lining the}} oral cavity is {{composed}} of epithelium supported by connective tissue. The shape of the epithelial-connective tissue interface has traditionally been used to describe physiological and pathological changes in the oral mucosa. Aim: The aim is to evaluate the morphometric complexity in normal, dysplastic, well-differentiated, and <b>moderately</b> <b>differentiated</b> squamous <b>cell</b> carcinoma (SCC) of the oral mucosa using fractal geometry. Materials and Methods: A total of 80 periodic acid–Schiff stained histological images of four groups: normal mucosa, dysplasia, well-differentiated SCC, and <b>moderately</b> <b>differentiated</b> SCC were verified by the gold standard. These images were then subjected to fractal analysis. Statistical Analysis: ANOVA and post hoc test: Bonferroni was applied. Results: Fractal dimension (FD) increases as the complexity increases from normal to dysplasia and then to SCC. Normal buccal mucosa {{was found to be}} significantly different from dysplasia and the two grades of SCC (P < 0. 05). ANOVA of fractal scores of four morphometrically different groups of buccal mucosa was significantly different with F (3, 76) = 23. 720 and P< 0. 01. However, FD of dysplasia was not significantly different from well-differentiated and <b>moderately</b> <b>differentiated</b> SCC (P = 1. 000 and P = 0. 382, respectively).

We present a case of 72 year-old African-American woman with decreased appetite, fatigue, and weight loss associated with intermittent right upper quadrant pain for two months. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a mass in the gallbladder and the hepatic flexure of the colon with involvement of adjacent small bowel. On exploratory laparotomy, a mass at {{the dome of the}} gallbladder was found with local invasion of the hepatic flexure, and the proximal transverse colon. There was no obvious involvement of the duodenum, common bile duct, or the extra-hepatic biliary tree. An extended right hemicolectomy, distal small bowel resection, cholecystectomy, a wedge resection of the liver and a feeding jejunostomy, were performed. Pathologic evaluation demonstrated well to <b>moderately</b> <b>differentiated</b> squamous <b>cell</b> carcinoma of gallbladder without evidence of distant metastasis. The patient improved clinically and was discharged home in good condition...|$|R
