It {{is connected to}} ground through a coiled retractable cable and 1 <b>megohm</b> resistor, which allows high-voltage charges to leak through but prevents a shock hazard when working with low-voltage parts. Where higher voltages are present, extra resistance (0.75 <b>megohm</b> per 250 V) is added in the path to ground to protect the wearer from excessive currents; this typically {{takes the form of}} a 4 <b>megohm</b> resistor in the coiled cable (or, more commonly, a 2 <b>megohm</b> resistor at each end).|$|E
50|$|Z0 probes are a {{specialized}} type of low-capacitance passive probe used in low-impedance, very-high-frequency circuits. They {{are similar in}} design to 10× passive probes but at much lower impedance levels. The probe cables usually have a characteristic impedance of 50 ohms and connect to oscilloscopes with a matched 50 ohm (rather than a 1 <b>megohm)</b> input impedance). High-impedance scope probes are designed for the conventional 1 <b>megohm</b> oscilloscope, but the 1 <b>megohm</b> input impedance is only at low frequency; the input impedance is not a constant 1 <b>megohm</b> across the probe's bandwidth but rather decreases with frequency. For example, a Tektronix P6139A input impedance starts falling above 10 kHz and is about 100 ohms at 100 MHz. A different probe technique is needed for high frequency signals.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} design inserts a 9 <b>megohm</b> {{resistor}} {{in series with}} the probe tip. The signal is then transmitted from the probe head to the oscilloscope over a special lossy coaxial cable {{that is designed to}} minimize capacitance and ringing. The invention of this cable has been traced to John Kobbe, an engineer working for Tektronix. The resistor serves to minimize the loading that the cable capacitance would impose on the DUT. In series with the normal 1 <b>megohm</b> input impedance of the oscilloscope, the 9 <b>megohm</b> resistor creates a 10× voltage divider so such probes are normally known as either low cap(acitance) probes or 10× probes, often printed with the letter X or x instead of the multiplication sign, and usually spoken of as [...] "a times-ten probe".|$|E

50|$|To {{minimize}} loading, attenuator probes (e.g., 10X probes) are used. A typical probe uses a 9 <b>megohm</b> {{series resistor}} shunted by a low-value capacitor {{to make an}} RC compensated divider with the cable capacitance and scope input. The RC time constants are adjusted to match. For example, the 9 <b>megohm</b> series resistor is shunted by a 12.2 pF capacitor for a time constant of 110 microseconds. The cable capacitance of 90 pF in parallel with the scope input of 20 pF and 1 <b>megohm</b> (total capacitance 110 pF) also gives a time constant of 110 microseconds. In practice, {{there will be an}} adjustment so the operator can precisely match the low frequency time constant (called compensating the probe). Matching the time constants makes the attenuation independent of frequency. At low frequencies (where the resistance of R is much less than the reactance of C), the circuit looks like a resistive divider; at high frequencies (resistance much greater than reactance), the circuit looks like a capacitive divider.|$|E

50|$|Because the {{oscilloscope}} input {{has some}} parasitic capacitance {{in parallel with}} the 1 <b>megohm</b> resistance, the 9 <b>megohm</b> resistor must also be bypassed by a capacitor {{to prevent it from}} forming a severe RC low-pass filter with the 'scope's parasitic capacitance. The amount of bypass capacitance must be carefully matched with the input capacitance of the oscilloscope so that the capacitors also form a 10× voltage divider.
