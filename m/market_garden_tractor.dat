50|$|<b>Garden</b> <b>{{tractors}}</b> (mini tractors) are small, light tractors {{designed for}} use in domestic gardens and small estates. <b>Garden</b> <b>tractors</b> are designed for cutting grass, snow removal, and small property cultivation. In the U.S., the term riding lawn mower today often is {{used to refer to}} mid- or rear-engined machines. Front-engined tractor layout machines designed primarily for cutting grass and light towing are called lawn tractors; heavier-duty tractors of similar size are <b>garden</b> <b>tractors.</b> <b>Garden</b> <b>tractors</b> are capable of mounting a wider array of attachments than lawn tractors. Unlike lawn tractors and rear-engined riding mowers, <b>garden</b> <b>tractors</b> are powered by horizontal-crankshaft engines with a belt-drive to transaxle-type transmissions (usually of four- or five-speeds, although some may also have two-speed reduction gearboxes, drive-shafts, or hydrostatic or hydraulic drives). <b>Garden</b> <b>tractors</b> from Wheel Horse, Cub Cadet, Economy (Power King), John Deere, Massey Ferguson and Case Ingersoll are built in this manner. The engines are generally a one- or two-cylinder petrol (gasoline) engines, although diesel engine models are also available, especially in Europe. Typically, diesel-powered <b>garden</b> <b>tractors</b> are larger and heavier-duty than gasoline-powered units and compare more similarly to compact utility tractors.|$|R
