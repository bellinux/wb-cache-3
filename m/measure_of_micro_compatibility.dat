40|$|The {{prediction}} that economic freedom is beneficial in reducing corruption {{has not been}} found to be universally robust in empirical studies. The present work reviews this relationship by using firms' data in a cross-country survey and argues that approaches using aggregated macro data {{have not been able to}} explain it appropriately. We model cross-country variations of the microfounded economic freedom-corruption relationship using multilevel models. Additionally, we analyse this relationship by disentangling the determinants for several components of economic freedom because not all areas affect corruption equally. The results show that the extent of the macro-effects on the <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> (<b>micro)</b> economic freedom for corruption, identified by the degree of economic development of a country, can explain why a lack of competition policies and government regulations may yield more corruption.

30|$|Micro gas sensors with micro-platforms, which consist <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> heaters and sensing {{electrodes}} on the membranes, {{have been}} actively researched, {{due to the}} possibility to miniaturize sensors and reduce power consumptions [1 – 4]. Micro heaters are necessary for elevated temperatures to operate micro gas sensors [5], because most of gas sensors need thermal energy to react gases [6, 7]. However, usually, {{it is hard to}} measure and control accurate temperatures <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> gas sensors with input powers to increase temperatures <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> heaters. In general, {{there are two kinds of}} measurement methods <b>of</b> temperature <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> heaters. One is contact type method such as thermocouples, negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors and Pt resistance temperature detectors (RTDs), and so on. The other is non-contact type method such as IR cameras. Even though many researchers have <b>measured</b> the temperatures <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> gas sensors by IR cameras, there are some still problems in terms of measurement errors by setting the incorrect emissivity and not enough precision due to the resolution of the cameras [8]. For instance, temperature measurement of the same device is remarkably changed with variations <b>of</b> emissivity. The <b>measured</b> temperature is highly dependent on emissivity of materials. The reason why it is difficult to determine the exact emissivity of IR camera is that other materials exist surrounding micro heater layer in the micro gas sensor as reported in [8, 9] and the emissivity is affected by not only the kinds of materials but also morphologies of surfaces and shapes of materials [10]. Also, it is not possible to measure the operating temperature <b>of</b> packaged <b>micro</b> gas sensors using by IR cameras. In the case of the contact type of temperature sensors, it is also hard to measure the operating temperature <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> gas sensors with membranes due to the fracture problem from fragile structures of membranes and thermal conductivity problem between the micro heaters and contact type temperature sensors. So, special micro temperature sensors are needed.|$|R

40|$|The mass {{production}} <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> components is nowadays a standard in production technology.

Despite the growing degree <b>of</b> automation in <b>micro</b> assembly processes, the decollating <b>of</b> the bulk <b>micro</b> components prior to the micro assembly processes is still characterized by manual labour which results in time consuming pre-positioning steps. To realize an efficient process chain for the assembly <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> systems, the sophisticated and fully automated handling, sorting and alignment <b>of</b> multiple <b>micro</b> components with a reproducible precision is necessary. In the research work which has been conducted at the Fraunhofer IPT within the Collaborate Research Centre SFB 440, mechanisms for the multiple alignment <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> components {{have been developed to}} fill the gap between the automated bulk production <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> components and the automated assembly <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> systems.

40|$|In 2001, {{the term}} micro film was {{proposed}} by director and music producer Zhiping Yang, {{referring to a}} novel form of online audiovisual art, which is short in terms of duration and production process with small-scale investment. This thesis aims {{to contribute to the}} fundamental research <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> film in Chinese media studies on the definition <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> film and offer three particular perspectives on the form. Contrary to current research that regards micro film as a new audio-visual art genre, I propose to view micro film as a hybrid between a genre and a medium in Chinese cyber culture. This will be addressed through the perspective of the art form <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> film, the genealogy <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> film, and micro film as a “new” medium. In the first perspective, I engage into the ongoing debate around which art form micro film is, that is, whether micro film is film or video. I argue that as different audio-visual art forms, film and video address their ideal spectators differently. Thus, the art form <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> film can be defined by analyzing the ideal spectatorship of film, video and micro film, respectively. The second perspective focuses on the hybridity <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> film as a new art genre, which is argued as the other reason contributing to the debate around the defining issue <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> film. I suggest studying the history <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> film to understand its hybrid feature. Rather than tracking the micro film history in a linear way as what Chinese researchers did, I propose to study the genealogy <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> film, which stresses the historical affiliations and resonances <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> film. I argue that short film, amateur video of egao and advertisement are the three main cultural forms which are remediated by micro film. The third perspective discusses the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> film as a medium. By studying the argument that micro film is the product of “new media”, I criticize that Chinese researchers who propose this argument avoid answering the most fundamental questions: what is the definition of “new media” to which they refer and what are the characteristics of these “new media”? Furthermore, I argue that it is problematic to adopt the term “new media” and suggest using participatory digital media instead. I continue to discuss that as a medium, what the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> film are in relation to the specifics of participatory digital media. Last, I analyze the problems for the further development <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> film. I argue that the root of these problems lies on the current way that micro film is defined since it cannot reflect the distinct characteristics <b>of</b> <b>micro</b> film as a hybrid between a genre and a medium...|$|R
