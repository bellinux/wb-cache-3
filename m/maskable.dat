25|$|Many {{statements}} {{have been}} made concerning the relationship between transsaccadic memory and visual short-term memory. Researchers have noted several similar characteristics between the two systems, leading several to believe that transsaccadic memory is in fact visual short-term memory or a part of visual short-term memory. Transsaccadic memory has a limited capacity of three to four items, a slow decay rate and <b>maskable</b> characteristics. Basically, transsaccadic memory can hold three to four items for each saccade, and the retention of items decays or disappears from consciousness slowly after {{the presentation of the}} stimulus. However, once a mask stimulus, such as a blank screen, is presented immediately after the stimulus, the items retained prior to the mask can be replaced and/or eliminated faster by the mask. All of these factors are typical characteristics of visual short-term memory. The content stored in transsaccadic memory are less-image like, more abstract and are sparse representations of the objects, which is found to be similar to the type of representations in visual short-term memory. Transsaccadic memory is different from visual short-term memory in that it takes into account the changes of the target's location due to the eye moving to new saccades. The information retained between saccades do not take into account positional information very well. Nevertheless, relational and identity information are well retained. Prime and colleagues (2006) hypothesize, transsaccadic memory utilizes egocentric mechanisms, like selective attention, to reduce the visual search of the target and allow for spatial information between saccades to be retained and updated by incorporation of information across saccades.|$|E

50|$|The 8085 has {{extensions}} {{to support}} new interrupts, with three <b>maskable</b> vectored interrupts (RST 7.5, RST 6.5 and RST 5.5), one non-maskable interrupt (TRAP), and one externally serviced interrupt (INTR). Each {{of these five}} interrupts has a separate pin on the processor, a feature which permits simple systems to avoid {{the cost of a}} separate interrupt controller. The RST 7.5 interrupt is edge triggered (latched), while RST 5.5 and 6.5 are level-sensitive. All interrupts are enabled by the EI instruction and disabled by the DI instruction. In addition, the SIM (Set Interrupt Mask) and RIM (Read Interrupt Mask) instructions, the only instructions of the 8085 that are not from the 8080 design, allow each of the three <b>maskable</b> RST interrupts to be individually masked. All three are masked after a normal CPU reset. SIM and RIM also allow the global interrupt mask state and the three independent RST interrupt mask states to be read, the pending-interrupt states of those same three interrupts to be read, the RST 7.5 trigger-latch flip-flop to be reset (cancelling the pending interrupt without servicing it), and serial data to be sent and received via the SOD and SID pins, respectively, all under program control and independently of each other.|$|E

Depending on its architecture, the type of corrective action or actions that a watchdog can trigger may be fixed or programmable. Some computers (e.g., PC compatibles) require a pulsed signal to invoke a processor reset. In such cases, the watchdog typically triggers a processor reset by activating an internal or external pulse generator, which in turn creates the required reset pulses.|$|E

On the 80286, the DOS program had to run in realmode.

Each 8-bit channel has its own audio control register which select the noise content and volume. For higher sound frequency resolution (quality), two of the audio channels can be combined for more accurate sound (frequency can be defined with 16-bit value instead of usual 8-bit).

50|$|However, the ULA {{must wait}} for a Z80 read or write to {{complete}} before it can stop the Z80's clock and access the memory. As the ULA has no capacity to prefetch and store data in advance, it relies upon the memory being available to read to produce a clean and true video display. If an existing Z80 access is in progress when the ULA must read video data, the read is missed and the display shows blank white pixels {{in place of the}} correct video pixels. On the next frame, they may well be read correctly. The consequences of this often appeared as a flickering of missing pixels on the display, or 'snow' as it was also called. To avoid snow, some programs and games only copied data to the display on interrupt, as the Spectrum <b>maskable</b> interrupt was generated by the display vertical refresh signal. This ensures that as much of the display as possible was updated during the blanking and border time when video data was not used.|$|E
50|$|The 6501 and 6502 have 40-pin DIP packages; the 6503, 6504, 6505, and 6507 are 28-pin DIP versions, for reduced {{chip and}} circuit board cost. In the 28-pin versions, the pin count {{is reduced by}} leaving {{off some of the}} {{high-order}} address pins and various combinations of function pins, making those functions unavailable. Typically, the 12 pins omitted are the three N.C. pins, one of the two Vss pins, one of the clock pins, the SYNC pin, the S.O. pin, either the <b>maskable</b> interrupt or the NMI, and the four most-significant address lines (A12 - A15) are the 12 pins omitted to reduce the pin count from 40 to 28. The omission of four address pins reduces the external addressability to 4 KB (from the 64 KB of the 6502), though the internal PC register and all effective address calculations remain 16-bit. The 6507 omits both interrupt pins in order to include address line A12, providing 8 KB of external addressability but no interrupt capability. The 6507 was used in the popular Atari 2600 video game console, the design of which divides the 8 KB memory space in half, allocating the lower half to the console's internal RAM and peripherals the upper half to the Game Cartridge&trade;, so Atari 2600 cartridges have a 4 KB address limit (and the same capacity limit unless the cartridge contains bank switching circuitry).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThrough saccadic eye movements, the retinal {{projection}} of an extrafoveally glimpsed object {{can be brought}} into foveal vision quickly. We investigated what influence visual detail collected before the saccade exerts on the postsaccadic percept. Participants were instructed to saccade towards a peripheral stimulus, and to indicate on a continuum of ellipses with varying aspect ratios which exact shape they had perceived to be present after saccade landing. Compared to both an identical ellipse preview and a qualitatively different square preview, a quantitatively different ellipse preview was observed to shift the mean postsaccadic percept towards the presaccadic aspect ratio parameter value. This integration of subtly different form information was accompanied by an integration of the identity of both stimuli presented: In {{the great majority of}} these trials, subjects indicated that they had not noticed the occurrence of a change to the stimulus. When a blank screen preceded the postsaccadic stimulus onset the influence of presaccadic stimulus information on postsaccadic perception was weaker. An immediate postsaccadic mask on the other hand abolished the effect entirely. We conclude that integration of parametric visual form information occurs across saccades, but that it relies on a quickly decaying and <b>maskable</b> visual memory...|$|E
40|$|Humans {{typically}} {{make several}} saccades per second. This provides {{a challenge for}} the visual system as locations are largely coded in retinotopic (eye-centered) coordinates. Spatial remapping, the updating of retinotopic location coordinates of items in visuospatial memory, is typically assumed {{to be limited to}} robust, capacity-limited and attention-demanding working memory (WM). Are pre-attentive, <b>maskable,</b> sensory memory representations (e. g. fragile memory, FM) also remapped? We directly compared trans-saccadic WM (tWM) and trans-saccadic FM (tFM) in a retro-cue change-detection paradigm. Participants memorized oriented rectangles, made a saccade and reported whether they saw a change in a subsequent display. On some trials a retro-cue indicated the to-be-tested item prior to probe onset. This allowed sensory memory items {{to be included in the}} memory capacity estimate. The observed retro-cue benefit demonstrates a tFM capacity considerably above tWM. This provides evidence that some, if not all sensory memory was remapped to spatiotopic (world-centered, task-relevant) coordinates. In a second experiment, we show backward masks to be effective in retinotopic as well as spatiotopic coordinates, demonstrating that FM was indeed remapped to world-centered coordinates. Together this provides conclusive evidence that trans-saccadic spatial remapping is not limited to higher-level WM processes but also occurs for sensory memory representations...|$|E
