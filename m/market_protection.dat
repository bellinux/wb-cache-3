40|$|Atypical work forms – such as {{independent}} contracting, on-call, or temporary work – {{have been criticized}} as providing employment that is more precarious than that offered by regular (open-ended) employment.

40|$|During {{the years}} 1918 – 1973 mutual home <b>market</b> <b>protection</b> {{agreements}} were common, {{for example in}} the Nordic forest industry. According to such agreements, each country abandoned or restricted the export of particular goods to each other’s country. These agreements {{are the focus of}} attention here and have been analysed through archival studies of individual companies, trade associations and the competition authorities. Within the export-intensive sectors, the export went primarily to non-Nordic countries. In those cases, the Nordic home <b>market</b> <b>protection</b> agreements had no apparent impact. However, agreements on home <b>market</b> <b>protection</b> were in several cases signed for goods that were domestic-market oriented and for goods that were exposed to import competition. Although the Nordic home <b>market</b> <b>protection</b> agreements infringed with the EFTA competition rules, many of them remained in force into the 1970 s. Several new agreements were also signed during the late 1960 s. When the 1973 free trade agreements between the EFTA states and European Communities entered into force, the Nordic home <b>market</b> <b>protection</b> agreements were officially abolished. The study shows that there were gentlemen's agreements on home <b>market</b> <b>protection</b> between the Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish companies {{until the end of the}} 1980 s. In the business world home <b>market</b> <b>protection</b> was seen as a normal state. Meanwhile, infringements that resulted in conflicts were common. These were often dissolved by renewed or formalised home market protections agreements. In the domestic markets the result of the agreements was eliminated or reduced import competition. At the same time the agreements were seen as a precondition for broader Nordic export collaborations. The study shows that relatively minor offenses against the home <b>market</b> <b>protection</b> agreements could result in collapsing both domestic cartel collaborations and international export cartels...|$|E

40|$|In the {{dissertation}} I {{explore the}} political sources of market liberalization and <b>market</b> <b>protection.</b> In Chapter II, I argue that autocratic leaders use liberalization either {{to stimulate the}} economy in their country and thereby preserve their autocracy, or, when preservation is prohibitively costly, they use liberalization to constrain future tax rates and protect their wealth in democracy. In stable autocracies, liberalization bolsters the economy, thereby making revolution less attractive to the political opposition. In democracy, liberalization makes assets more mobile and provides asset owners with a credible exit option, thereby limiting redistribution. Chapter III explores the impact of economic sanctions on future trade and financial policies. Regardless of whether sanctions are effective in achieving concessions, sanctions restrict international trade flows, creating rents for import-competing producers, who are protected from international competition. These rents can then be used to pressure the government to implement protectionist policies. Thus, sanctions create powerful interest groups in the sanctioned country who seek <b>market</b> <b>protection.</b> In Chapter IV, I distinguish between two types of financial restrictions: inflow restrictions, which limit the entry of capital into the country, and outflow restrictions, which limit capital exit from the country. Inflow restrictions benefit domestic capital owners, who compete with foreign capital owners, while outflow restrictions benefit labor at the expense of domestic capital owners, who lose the bargaining power associated with a credible exit option. I derive and evaluate predictions for inflow and outflow restrictions based on political institutions and market structure...|$|E
