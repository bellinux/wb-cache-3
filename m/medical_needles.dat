40|$|AbstractResistance to {{puncture}} {{is a critical}} property for several applications, in particular for elastomer materials used in protective clothing. To evaluate the puncture resistance of membranes, some methods have been proposed as standard tests. However, the rounded puncture probes used in these tests {{are very different from}} real pointed objects like <b>medical</b> <b>needles,</b> and may not measure the level of material resistance that correspond to them. In fact, puncture by <b>medical</b> <b>needles</b> is shown to proceed gradually as the needle cuts into the membrane. This behavior is highly different from puncture by rounded probes which occurs suddenly when the strain at the probe tip reaches the failure value. In addition, maximum force values are observed to be much smaller with <b>medical</b> <b>needles.</b> A method has been developed based on the change in strain energy with the puncture depth to evaluate the fracture energy associated {{to puncture}}. The results show that the phenomenon of puncture by <b>medical</b> <b>needles</b> involves contributions both from friction and fracture energy, in a similar way as for cutting.

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} new motion {{planning}} framework that explicitly considers uncertainty in robot motion {{to maximize the}} probability of avoiding collisions and successfully reaching a goal. In many motion planning applications ranging from maneuvering vehicles over unfamiliar terrain to steering flexible <b>medical</b> <b>needles</b> through human tissue, the response of a robot to commanded actions cannot be precisely predicted. We propose to build a roadmap by sampling collision-free states in the configuration space and then locally sampling motions at each state to estimate state transition probabilities for each possible action. Given a query specifying initial and goal configurations, we use the roadmap to formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we solve using Infinite Horizon Dynamic Programming in polynomial time to compute stochastically optimal plans. The Stochastic Motion Roadmap (SMR) thus combines a sampling-based roadmap representation of the configuration space, as in PRM’s, with the well-established theory of MDP’s. Generating both states and transition probabilities by sampling is far more flexible than previous Markov motion planning approaches based on problem-specific or grid-based discretizations. We demonstrate the SMR framework by applying it to nonholonomic steerable needles, {{a new class of}} <b>medical</b> <b>needles</b> that follow curved paths through soft tissue, and confirm that SMR’s generate motion plans with significantly higher probabilities of success compared to traditional shortest-path plans.

40|$|Precise needle {{placement}} {{is important}} {{for a number of}} percutaneous interventions in different medical field, as, for instance, in the interventional radiological field. To improve needle placement, navigation systems are now more and more used in these clinical applications [1, 2]. Nevertheless, they are still limited due to the inaccuracy coming from the needle deformation during the medical procedure [3]. In this abstract, we present our first results related to the feasibility of <b>medical</b> <b>needles</b> deformation tracking. Our talk is focused on the evaluation of a new home-made mechanical system enabling needle deformation tracking. This system is composed of two strain gauges and an electronic device. As the needle is deformed, the metallic foil pattern of each gauge is deformed, causing electrical resistance to change, and then the voltage at the electronic device output. Our hypothesis is that this voltage is a reproducible one-to-one function of the needle deformation. To demonstrate our hypothesis, we made a needle prototype, which was evaluated in an accurate benchmark. Following one strain gauge, we evaluate the voltage reproducibility by repeating 10 times, from an initial position, a same displacement of the needle tip. We then evaluate the voltage variation of the two strain gauges during the displacement of the needle tip in a plane. The first obtained results appear to be probative enough in order to investigate more precisely the real feasibility of using strain gauges for steerable <b>medical</b> <b>needles</b> deformation tracking. Taking into account this a priori information in real time will be very useful for improving the percutaneous intervention accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Puncture {{resistance}} {{is among the}} major mechanical properties often required for protective clothing, especially in the medical sector. However the intrinsic material parameters controlling puncture resistance of protective materials are still unknown. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} work is to study the mechanism and mechanical behaviors of puncture resistance of protective clothing materials to various probe types. A better understanding of puncture mechanics will be helpful to develop suitable methods to evaluate the puncture resistance and to predict the failure of protective clothing materials. The thesis includes 4 articles which expose two major phases in this study. Article I and II studied the mechanics and mechanisms of puncture by conical and cylindrical probes used in the standard test methods (ASTM F 1342 and ISO 13996). The results show that the punctures of rubber membranes by conical and cylindrical probes are controlled by a maximum local deformation (or puncture failure strain) that is independent of the probe geometry. The puncture strengths of elastomer membranes are much lower than their tensile and biaxial strengths. In addition, a simpler cylindrical probe can be used in the place of the costly conical probe required by the ASTM standard and still provides a quantitative characterization of puncture. Actually, since 2005, an alternative method B had been added to F 1342 ASTM with 0. 5 mm-diameter rounded-tip cylindrical probe. Furthermore, the puncture probes used in the ASTM F 1342 are very different to the actual pointed objects (medical needle, pointed tip of knife [...] .) and cannot accurately characterize the puncture resistance to real objects. Therefore, in the second step, the mechanics and mechanisms of puncture by <b>medical</b> <b>needles</b> were studied. Article III shows that the puncture by sharp-pointed objects like <b>medical</b> <b>needles</b> {{is very different from the}} puncture by conical probes used in the ASTM standard test. For <b>medical</b> <b>needles,</b> the puncture resistance involves cutting and fracture energy of material. Using the fracture mechanics, based on the change in strain energy with the change in fracture surface, the fracture energy in puncture was estimated. This calculation assumes that there is no friction between the needle tip and fracture surface. However, even with the application of a lubricant on the needle surface, the effect of friction on the puncture process cannot be totally eliminated, preventing the determination of the material fracture energy. Therefore, Article IV has described a method, similar to that of Lake and Yeoh for cutting to access the precise value of fracture energy in puncture of rubbers by sharp-pointed objects. The method allows substantially eliminating the effects of friction on the evaluation of the fracture energy involved in the puncture process...|$|E

Clinical studies as well as basic scientific research have shown that <b>medical</b> <b>needling</b> can significantly increase the quality of burn scars with comparatively low risk and stress for the patient with regards to skin elasticity, moisture, erythema and transepidermal water loss. However, <b>medical</b> <b>needling</b> has no influence on repigmentation of large hypopigmented scars. The goal {{of this study is}} to evaluate whether two established methods – needling (for improvement of scar quality) and non-cultured autologous skin cell suspension (for repigmentation) – can be successfully combined. Twenty subjects with mean age of 33 years (6 – 60 years) with scars from deep second and third degree burns have been treated. The average treated surface area was 94 cm 2 (15 – 250 cm 2) and was focused on prominent areas such as the face, neck, chest and arm. Percutaneous collagen induction or “medical needling” was performed using a roller covered with 3 mm long needles. The roller is vertically, horizontally and diagonally rolled over the scar, inducing microtrauma. Then, non-cultured autologous skin cell suspension (NCASCS) was produced and applied using the ReNovaCell Autologous Cell Harvesting Device (Avita Medical), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The patients were followed 12 months postoperatively. Pigmentation changes were measured objectively, as well as with patient and observer ratings. Patient satisfaction/preference was also obtained.

40|$|We explore motion {{planning}} for {{a new class of}} highly flexible bevel-tip <b>medical</b> <b>needles</b> that can be steered to previously unreachable targets in soft tissue. Planning for these procedures is difficult because the needles bend during insertion and cause the surrounding soft tissues to displace and deform. In this paper, we develop a planning algorithm for insertion of highly flexible bevel-tip needles into soft tissues with obstacles in a 2 D imaging plane. Given an initial needle insertion plan specifying location, orientation, bevel rotation, and insertion distance, the planner combines soft tissue modeling and numerical optimization to generate a needle insertion plan that compensates for simulated tissue deformations, locally avoids polygonal obstacles, and minimizes needle insertion distance. The simulator computes soft tissue deformations using a finite element model that incorporates the effects of needle tip and frictional forces using a 2 D mesh. We formulate the planning problem as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem that is locally minimized using a penalty method that converts the formulation to a sequence of unconstrained optimization problems.

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) {{infection is}} the leading cause of liver disease and liver cancer and a major source of health-related discrimination in China. To better target HBV detection and prevention programs, it is necessary to assess existing HBV knowledge, educational resources, reporting, and preventive practices, particularly among those health professionals who would be responsible for implementing such programs. Methods At the China National Conference on the Prevention and Control of Viral Hepatitis on April 26 - 29, 2004, the Asian Liver Center at Stanford University partnered with the China Foundation for Hepatitis Prevention and Control to distribute a voluntary written questionnaire to Chinese healthcare and public health professionals from regional and provincial Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health departments, and medical centers. Correct responses to survey questions were summed into a total knowledge score, and multivariate linear regression was used to compare differences in the score by participant characteristics. Results Although the median score was 81 % correct, knowledge about HBV was inadequate, even among such highly trained health professionals. Of the 250 participants who completed the survey, 34 % did not know that chronic HBV infection is often asymptomatic and 29 % did not know that chronic HBV infection confers a high risk of cirrhosis, liver cancer, and premature death. Furthermore, 34 % failed to recognize all the modes of HBV transmission and 30 % did not know the importance of the hepatitis B vaccine in preventing liver disease. Respondents who reported poorer preventive practices, such as not having personally been tested for HBV and not routinely disposing of used <b>medical</b> <b>needles,</b> scored significantly lower in HBV knowledge than those who reported sound preventive practices. Of note, 38 % of respondents reported positive HBsAg results to patients' employers and 25 % reported positive results to patients' schools, thereby subjecting those with positive results to potential discriminatory practices. Conclusions These results indicate that there is a need for development of effective educational programs to improve HBV knowledge among health professionals and the general public to avoid missed vaccination opportunities, reduce misconceptions, and eliminate discrimination based on chronic hepatitis B in China. </p...|$|E

40|$|Tissue {{puncture}} is {{ubiquitous in}} medicine, from percutaneous injections and biopsies to laparoscopic surgical access, epidural anesthesia, and cranial drilling; over 10 million puncture procedures are performed {{each year in}} the US alone. At the moment of puncture when the tissue fails at the tip of a puncture device, the tip of the device may travel farther than intended and impact underlying tissues or organs, causing dangerous and potentially deadly complications. Tissue puncture is performed on significantly varied tissue types and patient populations with countless different methods and devices; however, it is crucial to note that essentially all puncture procedures follow a common set of fundamental physical principles and are governed by many of the same characteristic parameters and phenomena. As such, broadly applicable devices and strategies may be developed to increase the safety and precision of tissue puncture across all medical disciplines. In this work we develop a general definition and common theoretical basis for medical tissue puncture, and extract key parameters which can be optimized to increase the safety and precision of puncture procedures. This work has resulted {{in the development of a}} test apparatus to measure tissue surface deflection during high-velocity deep tissue puncture. In addition, we have experimentally demonstrated that during deep tissue puncture with <b>medical</b> <b>needles,</b> for certain needle-tissue systems there exists an optimal insertion velocity such that tissue deflection is minimized. A first-order theoretical model is developed and suggests that this optimum velocity behavior is due to increasing hydrodynamic friction forces at higher insertion velocities. From this common fundamental approach to tissue puncture, several devices have been developed which may be applied to a variety of medical procedures to increase puncture precision. Specifically, a flexural tip-retraction mechanism actively opposes the forward "plunge" acceleration of a puncture device and is scalable for many medical and non-medical puncture applications. In addition, audible-frequency vibration of a puncture device is found to significantly decrease insertion force without causing additional immediate tissue damage, as confirmed by live tissue histology study. Results of this work may have significant effects on future device development. by Nikolai David Michael Begg. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>needles</b> {{may not be}} {{very popular}} among patients, but they are {{exceptionally}} versatile instruments that have {{found their way into}} virtually every clinical intervention imaginable. However, despite their versatility, needles can be very difficult to use, and there is much room for improvement. Improvements can be realized by optimization of needle geometry, by the development of training facilities for clinicians, imaging modalities and needle-based sensors, by development of needle-steering mechanisms and path planning methods, or even by fully automating the needle insertion process. These approaches all rely on a proper understanding of the mechanical interaction between needle and soft-tissue. Ideally, insight into needle-tissue interaction mechanics should follow from the development and refinement of theoretical models based on experimental observation. The development of theoretical models has received a lot of attention in the literature, but our inability to collect useful and reliable experimental data remains an important obstacle. For this reason, the present thesis deals with the experimental study of needle-tissue interaction. The goal of the thesis is to provide insight into needle-tissue interaction mechanics based on experimental observation. To achieve this goal we measure the axial component of the external force acting on the needle during interaction with tissue, and we observe the position of the needle relative to the surrounding tissue. The first part of the thesis provides a basis for experimentation. This includes a survey of literature related to needle-tissue interaction force measurements. The intention of this survey is to gather existing experimental evidence regarding the influence of different factors, such as needle type, tissue type, and insertion speed, on the axial force. Based on this survey, a data model is constructed that describes the interrelations between the different aspects of needle-tissue interaction experiments. This data model enables the detailed encoding of experimental equipment, conditions, design, and results, and can be used as the blueprint for a database for experimental needle-tissue interaction data. The second part of the thesis presents two examples of relatively well-controlled experiments involving artificial specimens. These examples illustrate what happens at the tip of a needle during puncture of a membrane. The first experiment involves the use of high speed video to investigate the relation between axial force and needle tip geometry. The second experiment presents a follow-up study that investigates the influence of needle coating (lubrication) on the axial force during membrane puncture. The last part of the thesis presents two examples of experiments involving biological tissue. The first example is an exploratory study aimed at the characterization of forces during needle insertion into the kidney of a human cadaver. This is done with the help of synchronized ultrasound visualization. The second example is concerned with needle insertion into isolated porcine kidneys, intended to achieve a more detailed characterization of forces for different anatomical structures inside the kidney. This experiment uses synchronized ultrasound visualization with the ultrasound probe moving along with the needle. The thesis contributes to the field of needle-tissue interaction mechanics by providing an overview of available knowledge concerning needle-tissue interaction forces, and by providing a framework for structuring and expanding this knowledge. The thesis provides some insight by illustrating how needle reuse, needle coating, and specimen boundary conditions influence specific force metrics in artificial specimens. In addition, the thesis provides a first impression of the variability encountered during needle insertion into human cadaverous kidneys, and it provides a multivariate stochastic model of membrane puncture forces in porcine kidneys {{that can be used to}} simulate puncture events. However, the most important contribution consists of a set of tools for gathering, analyzing, and disseminating experimental needle-tissue interaction data.

While straight needles are useful for many body parts, curved needles are manufactured for areas where straight needles are not ideal. The needle selected is typically the same gauge (or sometimes larger as with cartilage piercings) as the initial jewellery to be worn, with higher gauges indicating thinner needles. The needle is inserted into the body part being pierced, frequently by hand but sometimes {{with the aid of}} a needle holder or pusher. While the needle is still in the body, the initial jewellery to be worn in the piercing is pushed through the opening, following the back of the needle. Jewellery is often inserted into the hollow end of a needle, so that as the needle pulls through the jewellery is left behind.|$|R

In this paper, we aimed at investigating the relationship between the insertion forces and cutting edge geometry and general mathematical models of included and inclination angles for two different needle configurations. Two new geometries, one with parabolic cut and other with parabolic surface, cut with two bevel planes have been proposed along with the corresponding mathematical models to improve the cutting edge properties. Results show that parabolic needles after cutting with bevel planes have significantly improved cutting edge properties and are better than the other common needle configurations such as bevel cut. Simulation studies predicted that the deformation and stresses are slightly higher for proposed needle tip geometries than currently available topologies. However, the advantage of included and inclination angles reduce insertion forces thus optimization of <b>medical</b> <b>needle</b> design for the selected tip geometries is a trade-off between insertion forces and deflection in needle...|$|R
