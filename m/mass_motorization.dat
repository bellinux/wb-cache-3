On February 11, 1933, at the Berlin Motor Show, Hitler had already presented promotion of motoring as an important objective, and named an extensive road-building program as the third on his list of four means of realizing it. Weimar Germany was car-mad, {{and the number of}} private vehicles had increased from 130,346 in 1924 to 489,270 in 1932, but the percentage of car owners lagged behind that in other European countries, not to mention the U.S. This was still true in 1937; at best, most Germans could afford a motorbike, not a car, and the following year the highway commissioner of the State of Michigan observed, [...] "Germany has the roads while we have the traffic." [...] Car ownership was a [...] "powerful public desire". Motoring {{and the use of the}} autobahn for outings were heavily promoted. German manufacturers produced touring buses for the non-car-owning public, and the Volkswagen (then called the KdF-Wagen, Strength Through Joy car, for the Nazi recreation organization) was developed and marketed in association with the autobahn to promote car ownership; Hitler first publicly called for its development at the opening of the first Reichsautobahn segment. The war effort put an end to efforts at <b>mass</b> <b>motorization,</b> as savings and production cability for the KdF-Wagen instead went into the Kübelwagen, the military version for all the branches (Wehrmacht Heer, Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe) of the combined Wehrmacht armed forces.

However, the high cost of manufacture prevented the idea from developing into a <b>mass,</b> individual <b>motorization.</b> At the same time, the high price of the vehicle was meant few could afford it.

5000|$|The Santana's biggest {{success was}} in China. The Santana (B2) {{had been built}} in China {{on a small scale}} trial basis by the Shanghai Tractor Automobile Corporation (STAC), {{predecessor}} of the SAIC group, since 1982. The first 100 cars were built from CKD kits delivered from Germany. [...] In 1984, Volkswagen signed a contract with STAC, along with the China National Automotive Industry Corporation (CNAIC) and the Bank of China to form the Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive joint venture in October 1984. The first assembly line of the Santana started in October 1985. In September 1986, the 10,000th Santana was built in China. The car and venture laid the ground-works for China's <b>mass</b> <b>motorization.</b> The drive to fully localize production became the impetus for the Chinese auto parts industry: In 1986, the quota of made-in-China parts was below six percent. In 1995, the local content quota stood at 89 percent.|$|E
5000|$|After {{a certain}} trip modal share {{it may take}} more than just {{installing}} cycle tracks to create large increases in cycle rates. Cycling rates in the Netherlands peaked in the 1960s and dropped dramatically until the mid-1970s. The decline in bicycle use was [...] "not only caused by <b>mass</b> <b>motorization</b> {{but also by the}} related, fairly unco-ordinated process of urbanization and by scores of social, spatial and economic developments", such as a decrease in population density and increased travel distances. The bicycle was almost completely left out of the national government's vision. Certain cities, however, such as Amsterdam and Eindhoven, were slowly implementing more bicycle-positive policies: for example, bike-only streets and allowing cyclists to ignore one way streets. Throughout the 70s cycling rates increased, but the investments in bike paths made in the subsequent period had less effect. Between the late 1980s and early 1990s the Netherlands spent 1.5 billion guilders (US$945 million) on cycling infrastructure, yet cycling levels stayed practically the same.|$|E
50|$|In 1864, {{one year}} after the opening of the Metropolitan Railway in London, the Zürcherische Freitagszeitung (Zürich Friday Journal) {{published}} the visionary idea of a partly underground steam railway that was to go from the main station, along the Fröschengraben and end at Lake Zürich. However, the moat was filled up and became the Bahnhofstrasse instead. At the beginning of the 1930s, the development of the Zürich tramway network was by and large completed and newly built districts became accessible by bus and trolleybus lines. City architect Herbert Steiner, who had developed the Zürich building and zoning regulations in 1948, predicted that 550,000 people would be living in the city. He deemed the disentanglement of traffic streams and the massive expansion of public transport essential in order to realize the ideal of a garden city. However, in his opinion the city was and would always be too small for an underground railway. Architect Armin Meili and geographer Hans Carol held similar views, but due to the imminent post-war economic boom (Golden Age of Capitalism) and <b>mass</b> <b>motorization,</b> their voices remained almost unheard.|$|E
50|$|The {{immediate}} {{tasks in}} the early {{years after the end of}} World War II involved the reconstruction of the heavily damaged infrastructure and the replenishment of locomotives and rolling stock. Contrary to the Deutsche Reichsbahn in the GDR, the DB was not subject to reparations and benefited from the influx of capital through the Marshall Plan. During the early years, new steam engines were constructed and placed into service. The last new steam locomotive type was the Class 10, which entered service in 1957. Only two units of class 10 were built. In 1959 DB took the last steam locomotive delivery when the last of the class 23 locomotives was delivered. Soon, with increase in <b>mass</b> <b>motorization,</b> the railway started to lose passenger volume. As a result, rail buses were introduced on some lines, while other smaller volume lines were closed. Main lines became increasingly electrified. The later years of this epoch saw a decrease and eventual phasing out of steam engines, with the last one to cease regular service in 1977. Traction was provided increasingly by diesel and electric engines. With increased use of diesel and electric locomotives, progress was made in decreasing travel time for passengers. New types of passenger trains were introduced such as the Trans Europ Express and the InterCity.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the employment policies of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1939. The main {{emphasis is on}} the development of transport infrastructure and the automotive industry. These were chosen as "appropriate" to restore economic growth and tackle unemployment. A positive effect on the labor market is confirmed, due to a shortage of workers in the late thirties. Simple calculations and analysis of available statistical data show that the production of motor vehicles and roads and highways construction were not the main "drivers" of economic growth in and of themselves. However, their advantage was the binding of an additional industry and the resulting multiplier effect. After considering the economical results of the automotive industry and the subsequent international comparison, it is refuted that there was a <b>mass</b> <b>motorization</b> in Germany during the thirties. The military importance of transport policy was also very low, because the army preferred to other types of transportation. By comparing the selected measures of previous governments, it is demonstrated that the Nazi economic policy was not nearly as innovative, but rather followed and expanded the previous one...|$|E
30|$|After 1945 {{the system}} of limited entry (‘concessions’) and minimum prices for road haulage was sustained. With respect to aviation, Germany {{was not allowed to}} provide air {{transport}} services for several {{years after the end of}} World War II. The airline Deutsche Lufthansa was re-founded in 1955 as a state owned company. The separation of Germany into two states in 1949 led to severe challenges for infrastructure provision. Damages caused by the war had to be repaired, links to the former capital Berlin were capped, and new connections between the northern and the southern parts of West Germany had to be established. The rapid economic recovery (‘Wirtschaftswunder’ – ‘economic miracle’) made <b>mass</b> <b>motorization</b> possible. As a consequence, in the passenger transport markets the railway system as well as the local public transport operators lost a large portion of their customers. Therefore, in the 1960 s and 1970 s huge investments into the federal motorway and highway system (in order to reduce congestion) were paralleled by a demolishing of railroad lines in rural areas and tram systems in many cities. On the other hand, commuter rail systems have been extended in densely populated areas since the 1970 s.|$|E
40|$|The rise of {{logistics}} {{is explained}} by three factors. The first factor is an economic one: The development of a mass consumption society. In European countries, one can observe <b>mass</b> <b>motorization</b> and a gradual expansion of the motorway networks between 1960 and 1990. These networks facilitated truck transport, leading {{to the development of}} cheap transport, warehousing and distribution of consumer goods. This development is part of a mass consumption society, i. e. logistics enable the development of mass consumption societies. Another driver towards transportation and logistics was the European traffic policy. In the 1950 s, it enabled trucks to cross borders with full loads and to transit certain countries. Prior to 1980, the quotas for international truck traffic were regulated by bilateral agreements. But these quotas remained small. In the 1980 s and 1990 s, the European Union pursued a policy toward attaining a uniform market in the European Union. This pertained to the exchange of goods and for truck transportation services. The third factor refers to innovations in the parcel industry. In the 1990 s, logistics and transportation changed fundamentally. We can almost speak of a logistics revolution caused by a cooccurrence of various developments, much like the liberalization of the transport and telecommunications industries, the proliferation of internet technologies, the unification of Europe and the dissipation of communism, leading to a new orientation of logistics in the European market...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to give an answer to the {{questions}} whether China can make the quantum leap in automotive technology from engines that burn fossil-fuel to those that do not and whether China will take an “alternative Asian path of development. ” Design/methodology/approach – This paper is based on a sociological approach to prove potential technical innovations reflecting the social conditions of radical innovations like post-fossil mobility concepts. Findings – Innovations like a post-fossil car concept consist of more than new technical infrastructures and mere imitations, they require decentralized spaces for incubation and experimentation. Translated into conditions governing the policy milieu, that need means that potential promoters of innovations need fundamental political freedoms, equality before the law, legal certainty, and the advancement and protection of personal rights vis-à-vis the state. In a sociological perspective, China needs social modernization in the sense of differentiation, individualization, and internalization of external constraints. Research limitations/implications – This paper reflects the opportunities and restrictions of radical change in car technology in china. It does not give evidence for the future of conventional <b>mass</b> <b>motorization</b> as the continuance of the state of the art in car technologies. Practical implications – This paper implies – as a practical consequence – that the established car industry in the triad is furthermore responsible for progress in car and motor concepts being more energy efficient and less dependent from oil. Originality/value – The original contribution of this paper is that it connects the technical debate on the future of cars and their drive system with the discussion of social and political terms of collective capacity of radical innovations.

40|$|This is an {{introduction}} to a reprint of a major government report by Colin Buchanan, originally published in 1963. It {{is part of a}} series of such reprints currently undertaken by Routledge. Traffic in Towns, also known as the Buchanan Report, is {{regarded as one of the}} most influential planning documents of the twentieth century. The report reflected mounting concern about the impact on Britain’s towns and cities of rapid growth in the ownership and use of motor vehicles. Its purpose was to evaluate policy options for reducing the threat of traffic congestion to urban circulation and qualityof life. Two main conclusions were drawn from the report: firstly, the need for large-scale reconstruction to make Britain’s cities fit for the ‘motor age’, including split-level megastructures and urban motorways;and secondly, the simultaneous need to preserve parts of the city, especially residential areas as car-free zones or ‘environmental areas’. In Britain, successive governments drew back from implementing the full recommendations of the Study Group, despite initial cross-party support. The prohibitive cost of city-centre redevelopment and motorway construction meant a ‘comprehensive’ solution to the problem of urban traffic on Buchanan lines was never attempted. However, local authorities in a variety of British cities, such as Glasgow, Leicester and Leeds took up aspects of the Report. Internationally, too, the Report had a major impact in countries such as Sweden, Italy and Australia. In the longer term, the influence of the Report may be best judged by the incremental changes it setin train such as pedestrianization of city centres, traffic calming, and other measures linked to Buchanan’s concept of ‘environmental areas’. In focusing attention on the effects of <b>mass</b> <b>motorization</b> on the urban environment Traffic in Towns set the terms of debate for a generation, pre-figuring recent discussion about the car and urban sustainability.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between mobility {{and patterns of}} urban development has been in depth analyzed by many scholars since the Nineties. They clearly highlighted that the priority assigned during the last century to the private cars {{and the potential for}} a high freedom in all kind of trips guaranteed by cars represented the key factors for the fast spreading of low density residential settlements which, in turn, drove towards an increase in the mobility demand and, consequently to the building up of new road infrastructures. Such patterns of settlements, generally defined through the expression “urban sprawl”, often affect rural areas surrounding big cities, developing themselves along main transport axes and/ or along coastlines. Generally, these types of settlements are scattered and irregular, including large agricultural “enclaves”. They are also characterized, apart from the low densities, by the strict separation among residential, commercial and productive areas and by the lack of meeting places. Urban sprawl has been developing in the United States {{since the beginning of the}} last century, triggered and largely fed by the mass spreading of private cars. Up to the Fifties, the compactness of historical cities in Europe counterbalanced the spreading of the low densities residential settlements in the United States. Nevertheless, starting from the Fifties, urban sprawl has been rapidly spreading in Europe and in Italy too. In detail, in Italy, territorial development was largely relied upon road networks and only recently, in comparison with other European countries, more efforts have been directed towards the implementation of effective rail networks in urban areas too, meant as a key tool to avoid pollution and congestion phenomena, generally consequent to the <b>mass</b> <b>motorization.</b> In the Nineties, mainly due to the spreading of the sustainability paradigm, the awareness of the un-sustainability of a mobility largely relied upon private cars and of the numerous and generally undesirable effects due to the relation between mobility choices and sprawling of the cities largely increases. Thus, according to the current relevance of the phenomena of sprawling, this paper will focus on urban sprawl in Europe. In detail, based on current scientific literature and on the main findings of European Research Projects, the relation between patterns of residential settlements and mobility choices and the main consequences, in terms of environmental and social costs due to urban sprawl will be analysed. Finally, main issues and guidelines arising from European research projects and mainly addressed to change current mobility and land use patterns, opposing to urban sprawl and to its consequences, will be highlighted...|$|E
