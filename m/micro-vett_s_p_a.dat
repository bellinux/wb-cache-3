40|$|ABSTRACT Static program {{analysis}} (<b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>a.)</b> is {{utilized to}} reason about the run-time behavior of programs. Unfortunately, existing <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>a.</b> frameworks assume global (closed) programs, do not abstract well {{with regards to}} analysis or language, and lack a balance of compositionality with intensionality. We formalize and implement a framework for modular, automated <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>a.</b> It analyzes individual modules, links their results and computes analysis of the linked modules. It abstracts over analysis and language. And, it combines syntax-directed flow with comprehensive flow maintenance. We embark on natural semantics-based abstract interpretation as <b>a</b> generic <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>a.</b> framework that is both (semi) compositional and intensional. We obtain modularity through supercompilation (on-line partial evaluation) of natural semantics. First, we convert a classical natural semantics scheme into &quot;small-step &quot; tree-rewriting rules; these introduce &quot;partial derivation trees &quot; and enable supercompilation. Secondly, we modify higher-order values (closures) into functions. This yields &quot;higherorder &quot; derivations, that embed closures that embed derivations, and enables computing upon and reasoning about program modules. For each conversion, we prove congruence of derivations of the transformed rules {{to those of the}} corresponding original rules. We adapt and apply supercompilation to the tree-rewriting &quot;higher-order &quot; semantics given a modular program to perform its static analysis; linking is specified as a substitution on partial derivations...|$|R

40|$|Elastomeric {{materials}} play {{an important}} role in the orthodontic practice, including the retraction force to move teeth into extraction sites, closing diastemas, selective shifting of the midline and generalized space closure. Frictional resistance and ligating strength of archwire-bracket-ligature complex occurs during utilization of elastomeric and metallic ligatures when orthodontic forces are applicated. The aim of this study was to analyze elastic deformation of three types of elastomeric ligatures, after clinical use. Elastomeric ligatures: ring-shape, transparent, latex ligatures (Leone® <b>S.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>A.),</b> ring-shape, grey, polyurethane ligatures (Micerium® <b>S.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>A.)</b> and grey, polyurethane, Slide low-friction ligatures (Leone® <b>S.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>A.).</b> A total of 9 orthodontic patients undergoing fixed orthodontic therapy were selected. Three specimens were applied, one for each types of ligature, inside the oral cavity of each subject. Samples were kept in the oral cavity for 28 days, ligating 0. 16 X 0. 22 inches stainless steel archwires to stainless steel premolars brackets (Leone® <b>S.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>A.,</b> Sesto Fiorentino, FI, Italy) for Bidimensional technique. After the pre-established time, the systems of ligature were removed and washed. Control Group consisted of 9 unused specimens of each ligation type. Each elastomeric ligature was observed under the scanning electron microscope (SEM) to determine variations in size. The archwire-bracket-ligature complex was also analyzed. Transparent O-ring ligatures showed significant volumetric and structural changes. The external rounded shape was rather maintained, while the internal shape tended to appear square. Both external and internal diameter significantly increased (p< 0. 005 and p< 0. 0001 respectively) while the thickness decreased (p< 0, 005) when analyzed with t-test. Polyurethane ring-shape ligatures retained the initial ring design. Both external and internal diameter increased (p< 0. 0001), while the thickness remained almost unchanged. The internal border was more squared, and showed jagged edges with continuous and irregular extroversions. Grey, polyurethane Slide low-friction ligatures showed a reduced dimensional change. There was a slight increase in two dimensions, length and width, (14 - 16...|$|R

Different cavitating behavior has been observed at different values of the blade tip clearance, particularly near breakdown conditions. The intensity of pressure oscillations tends to decrease as the tip blade clearance increases, and cavitation-induced azimuthal flow instabilities appear to be more sensitive to changes of the blade tip clearance than axial flow instabilities. Finally, the presence of backflow seems to have a stabilizing effect on rotating cavitation instabilities...|$|R

40|$|Bachelor thesis, Trolley Innovation Project, {{has been}} {{unique in the}} sense that it has been carried out over the borders of Sweden. Iacobucci <b>S.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>A,</b> located outside of Rome in Italy is one of the largest {{manufacturers}} of interior equipment for aircraft in the world. With approximately 30 % of the market Iacobucci <b>S.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>A</b> is one of the world's largest manufacturers of catering trolleys. The aim has been to produce a new competitive catering trolley for the airline industry. With customers and users in focus, the project team found that weight, ease of use, ergonomics and design were important aspects. Having a low weight of all the interior is particularly important when there is lots of money for the airlines to save in reduced fuel costs. The weight is really important, because of the currently major liquidity problems in the industry. There are a lot of requirements how to build a catering trolley. For example, size, material, weight, safety, etc. This makes it extra hard to be innovative. Trolley Innovation Project has nevertheless, managed to build a catering trolley, that is up to three kilograms lighter than the existing variants from Iacobucci <b>S.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>A.</b> Among other things, a new brake system is developed, which is nearly 80 % lighter than previously and also more ergonomic and user friendly. A new multi-functional side panel have been developed, whose structure is up to three times stiffer against a flat surface, and at the same time fulfills the purpose of shelves on the inside. What will Trolley Innovation Project lead to? Thanks to the project new business links with Swedish and international companies have been created. The project team hopes that these contacts will remain valuable in the future. The innovations that have been developed during Trolley Innovation Project will inspire the product development work in a conservative industry and in particular lead to a more customer-and user-adapted catering trolley. The catering trolley will as a whole, or parts of it, lead to Iacobucci <b>S.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>A's</b> market share increases...|$|R
