5|$|As {{the city}} prepares for the {{memorial}} service, Leslie and Ben are caught making {{out by a}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>worker</b> named George (Biff Yeager), so they send him home with a gift certificate {{in exchange for his}} silence. Unfortunately, George had the propane for Li'l Sebastian's eternal flame, which results in later confusion behind the scenes, that Leslie and Ben struggle to fix throughout the night. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is sent to get propane for the flame but buys lighter fluid instead; this causes a huge fireball to shoot into the air when Ron lights it, which singes off his eyebrows, part of his mustache and hair. Leslie and Ben are relieved, however, when the crowd applauds in the belief the fireball was staged. Entertainment 720's show also proves to be a hit with the crowd, which makes Tom further contemplate quitting his job.|$|E

25|$|On 21 June 2001, a 20-year-old woman {{died while}} on the ride after two {{carriages}} collided.

Faulty wiring had also caused a malfunction on the ride. In October 2004, the deputy coroner ruled death by misadventure. On November 14, 2006, the park was charged with failing to ensure {{the health and safety}} of riders, and the ride operator was charged with failing to ensure safety through his work. Both pleaded guilty. The ride manufacturer, Reverchon Industries SA, was convicted of two charges of failing to ensure the ride's safe design and construction.|$|E
25|$|Insider {{sabotage}} regularly occurs, because insiders {{can observe}} and work around security measures.

A fire caused 5–10 million dollars worth of damage to New York's Indian Point Energy Center in 1971. The arsonist {{turned out to be}} a plant <b>maintenance</b> <b>worker.</b> Sabotage by workers has been reported at many other reactors in the United States: at Zion Nuclear Power Station (1974), Quad Cities Nuclear Generating Station, Peach Bottom Nuclear Generating Station, Fort St. Vrain Generating Station, Trojan Nuclear Power Plant (1974), Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant (1980), and Beaver Valley Nuclear Generating Station (1981).

25|$|Several {{months before}} the {{bankruptcy}} announcement, workers at the company's Goose Island warehouse had noticed that key pieces of equipment were being removed.

Despite company assurances that the missing machinery had merely been removed to make way for more modern equipment, the union began covertly monitoring the plant. One night, while monitoring the plant, UE Local 1110 President and Republic <b>maintenance</b> <b>worker</b> Armando Robles and UE union organizer Mark Meinster planned a strategy to occupy the factory {{in the event of a}} plant closing.|$|E

25|$|Harry Beck was a <b>maintenance</b> <b>worker</b> {{with the}} Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co. (C) in Maryland and a CWA organizer. Beck protested {{the use of}} his union dues for a {{political}} cause in which he did not believe and asked for a refund. The CWA refused, arguing that using union dues for political expenditures was appropriate and legal. In the early 1970s, after disagreeing with national CWA officials over a union organizing drive in suburban Baltimore, Maryland, Beck resigned from the union and began to pay the $10-a-month agency fee. Beck continued to protest {{the use of his}} agency fee for political purposes, and asked the CWA to provide a more accurate accounting of how much money it spent on politics. The union refused. In June 1976, Beck and 19 other non-union members of the CWA's bargaining unit at C sued the union for a refund. The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation provided legal counsel and support to Beck and the other 18 workers. Beck quit C in 1979 and moved to Oregon, where he worked at CWA-organized job at American Telephone & Telegraph and continued to pay his agency fee.|$|E
25|$|In November 1996, Mike Eidson, a Miami attorney, {{said in an}} {{interview}} that many of the passengers had survived the initial impact but had drowned afterward. Eidson represented 41 passengers and crew in a lawsuit contending that the aircraft's manufacturer, Boeing, bore responsibility for the disaster, as the company ought to have foreseen the misuse of its products. The suit was filed against Boeing in federal court in Miami in May 1997. According to the complaint, the flightdeck errors were caused by careless maintenance by Aeroperú and negligence and defective design by Boeing. Boeing argued that it was not at fault, and that responsibility for the accident lay with the employee who did not remove the tape from the static ports, and the aircraft's pilot for not noticing the tape still applied by visual check. Richard Rodriguez of the NTSB said that it was understandable that Schreiber did not find the tape because the <b>maintenance</b> <b>worker</b> had used duct tape instead of the brightly colored tape that he was supposed to use. In addition, Rodriguez said that the pitot-static ports were high above the ground. Therefore, Schreiber could not have seen the tape against the fuselage. After extensive litigation, the parties agreed to transfer the case against Boeing and Aeroperú to an international arbitration in Santiago, Chile, for a determination of the damages. The defendants agreed not to contest liability in Chile.|$|E
