BabinA Surface Tension Element (STE), {{device was}} {{successfully}} constructed and tested {{as the primary}} moisture removal device in a condensing dryer. The STE was tested via the SAE ARP 901 bubble-point test method and resulted in an average <b>micron</b> <b>rating</b> of 46. 8 microns. The operation of the STE was {{compared to that of}} the typical air-to-air heat exchanger/condenser used in condensing dryers.

The results indicated that the STE used an average of 0. 616 kilowatt-hours per kilogram dry laundry while the air-to-air heat exchanger/condenser used an average of 0. 643 kWh/kg. This resulted in an improvement of the European efficiency label from class C to Class B.

40|$|Wound {{filters are}} quite {{popular in the}} {{domestic}} water purification systems. The performance of these filters {{is based on the}} distinctive yarn and winding variables. Yarn used for filtration application is normally produced on DREF spinning system. Several researchers have reported the influence of DREF spinning variables on yarn properties. However none of them are in context of filtration application. Since elucidation of influence of winding parameters on the filter performance has already been reported; it thus becomes intriguing to explore the influence of spinning suction pressure on filtration behavior. Yarn spun at different suction pressures was used to produce wound filter cartridges, keeping winding variables unchanged. Filters wound using yarn spun at higher spinning suction pressure resulted in greater pressure drop but showed better <b>micron</b> <b>rating.</b> However the pressure drop encountered also affects the retention capacity of the wound filter. The outcome of this study helps in establishing the relation between spinning suction pressure and performance parameters of wound filters. Design expertÂ® software was used to develop regression equations to predict performance of wound filter for the given spinning suction pressure which is of practical significance for yarn and filter manufacturers, without performing filter test...|$|E

The hydrogenase had a relative molecular mass of 58 000 as determined by gel filtration and was estimated to contain six iron atoms and six acid-labile sulphur groups per molecule. The absorption spectrum of the enzyme was characteristic of an iron-sulphur protein. The E 400 and E 280 were 28 500 and 109 000 M- 1. cm- 1 respectively. The e. s. r. of the oxidized protein indicated the presence of [4 Fe- 4 S] 3 + or [3 Fe- 3 S] 3 +, and another paramagnetic centre, probably Ni(III). The hydrogenase was inhibited by heavy-metal salts, carbon monoxide and high ionic strength. However, it was resistant to inhibition by thiol-blocking and metal-complexing reagents. N-Bromosuccinimide totally inhibited the enzyme activity at low concentrations. The enzyme was stable to O 2 over long periods and to high temperatures.

40|$|We {{have used}} a new cinemicroscopy {{technique}} in combination with antitubulin immunofluorescence microscopy to investigate the timing of mitotic events in cells of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe having lengths at division between 7 and 60 microns. Wild-type fission yeast cells divide at a length of 14 microns. Separation of daughter nuclei (anaphase B) proceeds {{at a rate of}} 1. 6 +/- 0. 2 microns min- 1, until the spindle extends the length of the cell. Coincident with spindle depolymerization, the nuclei reverse direction and take up positions that will become the center of the two daughter cells. This post-mitotic nuclear migration occurs at a rate of 1. 4 +/- 0. 5 microns- 1. In cells in which the weel+ gene is overexpressed fivefold and that have an average length at mitosis of 28 <b>microns,</b> the <b>rate</b> of nuclear separation was only slightly reduced but, as spindles in these cells measure 20 - 22 microns, the duration of anaphase B was extended by approximately 40 %. By contrast, in the mutant weel. 50, which divides at 7 <b>microns,</b> both the <b>rate</b> and duration of anaphase B were indistinguishable from wild type. Nuclei reach the ends of these cells earlier but remain there until a point corresponding to the time of postmitotic nuclear migration in wild type.

40|$|Cracks in {{concrete}} generally interconnect flow paths and increase concrete permeability. The increase {{in concrete}} permeability {{due to the}} progression of cracks allows more water or aggressive chemical ions to penetrate into the concrete, facilitating deterioration. The present work studies the relationship between crack characteristics and concrete permeability. In this study, feedback controlled splitting tests are introduced to generate crack width-controlled concrete specimens. Sequential crack patterns with different crack widths are viewed under a microscope. The permeability of cracked concrete is evaluated by water permeability tests. The preliminary results indicate that crack openings generally accelerate water flow rate in concrete. When a specimen is loaded to have a crack opening displacement smaller than 50 microns prior to unloading, the crack opening has little effect on concrete permeability. When the crack opening displacement increases from 50 microns to about 200 microns, concrete permeability increases rapidly. After the crack opening displacement reaches 200 <b>microns,</b> the <b>rate</b> of water permeability increases steadily. The present research may provide insight into developing design criteria for a durable concrete and in predicting service life of a concrete structure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the low-temperature oxidation of coal using pore model resembling ordinary tree structures, where {{the trunk of}} each effective pore reaches {{the exterior of the}} coal particle. Theoretical analysis shows that, at low temperatures and atmospheric pressure, the mean diffusivity of oxygen in a coal particle is related to the porosity and particle size, and varies between 10 - 8 and 10 - 6 m 2 /s. When the particle size is large (more than 1 mm in diameter), the coal oxidation is controlled by continuum diffusion, while for a very fine particle the reaction regime switches to Knudsen-diffusion controlled (for active coal) or kinetically controlled (for less active coal). With increasing porosity of fine coal particles, the trend for the reaction regime to be kinetically controlled becomes more significant. For the less active coal with high porosity and particle size of several tens of microns, the reaction regime is almost entirely kinetically controlled. The rate of oxygen consumption of coal usually shows a dependence on particle size, {{but in the case of}} the less active coal and a particle size of a few tens of <b>microns,</b> the <b>rate</b> of oxygen consumption is virtually independent of the particle size. The independence of the rate of oxygen consumption of the particle size is also observed for larger particles (even around 500 Î¼m in radius), when the coal reactivity is sufficiently low.

40|$|Fluorescence lidar {{measurements}} of the hydroxyl radical require detailed information concerning collision induced processes in order to deduce the radical number density from a lidar return.

40|$|International audienceVulnerable plaque {{morphology}} {{has been}} described by gross pathology and intravascular ultrasound, but morphological criteria cannot fully explain vulnerability, which involves four distinct factors: 1) inflammatory and biological processes; 2) geometry; 3) composition; and 4) hemodynamic stress. These last three aspects underlie the biomechanical study of vulnerable plaque. By virtue of the nature of their evolution, atherosclerotic plaques tend to be excentric, and this is a crucial morphological feature, causing circumferential stress to peak in very specific juxta-luminal locations, where it can exceed the rupture threshold of collagen, the basic constituent of arterial architecture. The lipido-necrotic core covered by a fibrous cap, formed in young plaques, is another morphological feature, which, can also increase and concentrate circumference stress in the juxta-luminal fibrous cap. The larger the lipid core, the thinner the fibrous cap and the greater is the stress. There are also inflammatory processes in such areas, which tend to reduce cap thickness. Ruptures occur when this thickness falls below 65 <b>microns.</b> Heart <b>rate,</b> blood pressure and pulse pressure are all biomechanical factors affecting vulnerable arterial walls, increasing circumferential stress and material fatigue. Vulnerable plaques are almost always associated with positive arterial remodeling. Numerical simulation has shown such so-called compensatory remodeling to be exclusively due to the healthy arc stretching in vulnerable plaques. Positive remodeling is optimal when the healthy arc is around 170 degrees, which keeps the lumen area relatively stable as long as the plaque does not exceed 40 % to 50 %. This mechanism does not apply to concentric plaques. In conclusion, the mechanism of vulnerable plaque rupture is highly complex and multifactorial. This complexity more or less precludes prediction in individual cases: we are in the realms of chaos theory and acute sensitivity to initial conditions. The greatest caution is therefore required in any attempt to predict rupture from diagnostic imagery, which provides only morphological data on plaque's nature...|$|R

Arterial ammonia levels were 52 - 264 <b>micron.</b> The <b>rate</b> of ammonia clearance from the vascular compartment (metabolism) was a linear function of its arterial concentration: mumol/min = 4. 71 [NH 3]a + 3. 76, r = + 0. 85, P less than 0. 005. Quantitative body scans showed that 7. 4 +/- 0. 3 % of the isotope was metabolized by the brain. The brain ammonia utilization rate, calculated from brain and blood activities, was a function of the arterial ammonia concentration: mumol/min per whole brain = 0. 375 [NH 3]a - 3. 6, r = + 0. 93, P less than 0. 005. Assuming that cerebral blood flow and brain weights were normal, 47 +/- 3 % of the ammonia was extracted from arterial blood during a single pass through the normal brains. Ammonia uptake was greatest in gray matter. The ammonia utilization reaction(s) appears to take place in a compartment, perhaps in astrocytes, that includes less than 20 % of all brain ammonia. In the 11 nonencephalopathic subjects the [NH 3]a was 100 +/- 8 micron and the brain ammonia utilization rate was 32 +/- 3 mumol/min per whole brain; in the 11 encephalopathic subjects these were respectively elevated to 149 +/- 18 micron (P less than 0. 01), and 53 +/- 7 mumol/min per whole brain (P less than 0. 01). In normal subjects, approximately equal to 50 % of the arterial ammonia was metabolized by skeletal muscle.

However, these two groups retain approximately 50 % of the loci examined as functioning duplicates, despite the passage of 50 million years or more of mutation and selection. Although other effects are not excluded, this apparently slow rate of duplicate silencing can be {{explained in terms of}} the effects of selection against defective double homozygotes to unlinked duplicates. We have derived a computer simulation of genetic drift that affords direct evaluation of the effects of population size (N), mutation <b>rate</b> (<b>micron),</b> initial allele frequencies, back mutation, fitness, and time on the probability of fixation for null alleles at unlinked duplicate loci. The results show that this probability is approximately linearly related to population size for N {{greater than or equal to}} 10 (3). Specifically, for naive populations, the time for 50 % probability of gene silencing is approximately equal to 15 N + micron- 3 / 4 generations. The retention of 50 % of the loci as functional duplicates may therefore result from the large effective size of salmonid and catastomid populations. The results also show that, under most conditions for populations of 2000 [...] 3000 or larger, unlinked duplicate loci will be sustained in the functional state longer than tandem (linked) duplicates and hence are available for evolution of new functions for a longer time...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the diffuse X-ray emission in 19 compact groups (CGs) of galaxies observed with Chandra. The hottest, most X-ray luminous CGs agree well with the galaxy cluster X-ray scaling relations in L(x-T) and (L(x-sigma), even in CGs where the hot gas is associated with only the brightest galaxy. Using Spitzer photometry, we compute stellar masses and classify Hickson CGs 19, 22, 40, and 42, and RSCGs 32, 44, and 86 as fossil groups using a new definition for fossil systems that includes a broader range of masses. We find that CGs with total stellar and Hi masses are great than or equal to 10 (sup (11. 3) solar mass are often X-ray luminous, while lower-mass CGs only sometimes exhibit faint, localized X-ray emission. Additionally, we compare the diffuse X-ray luminosity against both the total UV and 24 <b>micron</b> star formation <b>rates</b> of each CG and optical colors of the most massive galaxy in each of the CGs. The most X-ray luminous CGs have the lowest star formation rates, likely because there is no cold gas available for star formation, either because the majority of the baryons in these CGs are in stars or the X-ray halo, or due togas stripping from the galaxies in CGs with hot halos. Finally, the optical colors that trace recent star formation histories of the most massive group galaxies do not correlate with the X-ray luminosities of the CGs, indicating that perhaps {{the current state of the}} X-ray halos is independent of the recent history of stellar mass assembly in the most massive galaxies...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of bed bug (Cimex lectularius L.) tarsi were investigated {{in order to}} evaluate their vulnerability to piercing by plant trichomes (sharp microscopic hairs). This information will help inform development of physical methods for control of insect pests such as bed bugs. Nanoindentation {{was used to measure}} the force required to insert a sharp probe into the cuticle of the tarsi in different regions, as well as to determine creep and reduced elastic moduli for the cuticle. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize the indents that had been generated by nanoindentation. Scanning electron microscopy was also used to visualize the process of indent formation while poking the cuticle with a nanomanipulator. Focused ion beam milling was used to determine cuticle thickness for different regions of the tarsi. The force required to insert a sharp object into the cuticle of the tarsus was determined for depths ranging from 1 to 9 <b>microns</b> at strain <b>rates</b> ranging from 0. 003 to 0. 5 s- 1. Greater force was required to insert a sharp object at greater depth or at faster strain rates. A specific region of the pretarsal claws (membrane with microtrichia) was more frequently pierced by trichomes during bed bug locomotion, and was more easily pierced, exhibited more creep, and had a lower reduced elastic modulus. The combination of these mechanical attributes, in addition to the presence of natural infoldings in the cuticle of this area, make the membrane with microtrichia of the pretarsal claws particularly vulnerable to piercing...|$|R
40|$|Submerged arc strip {{cladding}} {{is often}} used when thickness of clad material is required. The productivity of this process has been improved {{by the use of}} higher welding currents and wider strips. The associated problems were arc blow, increased penetration and poor bead characteristics. Dilution is the parameter that controls almost all qualities of cladding. Magnetic steering reduces penetration, and hence, dilution and arc blow control. Stainless steel cladding on mild steel {{is often used}} to impart corrosion resistance. In such situations, the clad quality is specified by corrosion resistance, ferrite content and good fusion between clad metal and base metal. This paper discusses results of an investigation on the effect of an oscillating magnetic field used to steer the arc in submerged arc strip cladding using 60 X 0. 5 -mm 309 L stainless steel strips, with varying magnetizing flux intensity and dwell time. The resulting test pieces were evaluated for parameters that imparted the best clad quality and the results indicate the following: 1) Magnetic steering of the arc reduces dilution and corrosion rate. 2) Magnetic steering of the arc permits use of higher currents for a given dilution level, thus increasing productivity. 3) Clad metal microstructures of a desirable type are obtained when the arc is magnetically steered. 4) Use of 309 L strips for single layer cladding appears to be satisfactory since ferrite content lies between 5 to 10 % for a variety of welding conditions. 5) The corrosion <b>rate</b> (<b>microns</b> per 24 hours) is linearly related to the dilution percentage of the clad metal...|$|R
40|$|Infra-Red(IR) astronomical databases, namely, IRAS, 2 MASS, WISE, and Spitzer, {{are used}} to analyze {{photometric}} data of 126 carbon stars whose spectra are visible in the First Byurakan Survey low-resolution spectral plates. Among these, six new objects, recently confirmed on the digitized FBS plates, are included. For three of them, moderate-resolution CCD optical spectra are also presented. In this work several IR color-color diagrams are studied. Early and late-type C stars are separated in the JHK Near-Infra-Red(NIR) color-color plots, {{as well as in}} the WISE W 3 -W 4 versus W 1 -W 2 diagram. Late N-type Asymptotic Giant Branch stars are redder in W 1 -W 2, while early-types(CH and R giants) are redder in W 3 -W 4 as expected. Objects with W 2 -W 3 > 1. 0 mag. show double-peaked spectral energy distribution, indicating the existence of the circumstellar envelopes around them. 26 N-type stars have IRAS Point Source Catalog(PSC) associations. For FBS 1812 + 455 IRAS Low-Resolution Spectra in the wavelength range 7. 7 - 22. 6 micron and Spitzer Space Telescope Spectra in the range 5 - 38 micro are presented clearly showing absorption features of C 2 H 2 (acetylene) molecule at 7. 5 and 13. 7 micron, and the SiC(silicone carbide) emission at 11. 3 <b>micron.</b> The mass-loss <b>rates</b> for eight Mira-type variables are derived from the K-[12] color and from the pulsation periods. The reddest object among the targets is N-type C star FBS 2213 + 421, which belong to the group of the cold post-AGB R Coronae Borealis(R CrB) variables. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|The Martian {{polar night}} {{distribution}} of 1. 27 micron (0 - 0) band emission from O 2 singlet delta [O 2 (1 Delta(sub g)) ] is determined from an extensive set of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectral Mapping (CRISM) limb scans observed {{over a wide}} range of Mars seasons, high latitudes, local times, and longitudes between 2009 and 2011. This polar nightglow reflects meridional transport and winter polar descent of atomic oxygen produced from CO 2 photodissociation. A distinct peak in 1. 27 micron nightglow appears prominently over 70 - 90 NS latitudes at 40 - 60 km altitudes, as retrieved for over 100 vertical profiles of O 2 (1 Delta(sub g)) 1. 27 <b>micron</b> volume emission <b>rates</b> (VER). We also present the first detection of much (x 80 +/- 20) weaker 1. 58 micron (0 - 1) band emission from Mars O 2 (1 Delta(sub g)). Co-located polar night CRISM O 2 (1 Delta(sub g)) and Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) (McCleese et al., 2008) temperature profiles are compared to the same profiles as simulated by the Laboratoire de Mtorologie Dynamique (LMD) general circulation/photochemical model (e. g., Lefvre et al., 2004). Both standard and interactive aerosol LMD simulations (Madeleine et al., 2011 a) underproduce CRISM O 2 (1 Delta(sub g)) total emission rates by 40 %, due to inadequate transport of atomic oxygen to the winter polar emission regions. Incorporation of interactive cloud radiative forcing on the global circulation leads to distinct but insufficient improvements in modeled polar O 2 (1 Delta(sub g)) and temperatures. The observed and modeled anti-correlations between temperatures and 1. 27 mm band VER reflect the temperature dependence of the rate coefficient for O 2 (1 Delta(sub g)) formation, as provided in Roble (1995) ...|$|R
40|$|McClellan and Winegrad (1980, J. Gen. Physiol., 75 : 283 - 295) have {{reported}} that in rat ventricular muscles that {{have reported}}ly been made "hyperpermeable" to small ions such as Ca 2 +, CaEGTA 2 -, and MgATP 2 - by a soak in EGTA, the maximum Ca 2 +-regulated force can be permanently increased by a short exposure to positively inotropic drugs, such as epinephrine or cAMP plus theophylline, {{in the presence of}} the detergent Triton X- 100. The experiments reported here were begun as an attempt to repeat and extend this important observation. However, no evidence could be found for a potentiation of force that was not merely produced by Triton alone. In addition, the thickest muscles used (250 - 440 microns diameter) exhibited very low values for force per unit cross- sectional area, which suggested that either Ca 2 + reached only a fraction of the myofibrils or the myofibrils were in a state of low contractility. The results of further experiments that were designed to test the permeability characteristics of these EGTA-treated muscles indicated that the movement of certain ions into these preparations was restricted, even in thin muscles (80 - 200 <b>microns</b> diameter). The <b>rate</b> of development of Ca 2 +-regulated force was slow (t 1 / 2 approximately equal to 1 - 3 min), but was greatly accelerated after the muscles had been superfused with Triton X- 100 (t 1 / 2 approximately equal to 10 - 20 s). Removal of creatine phosphate (CP) in the presence of MgATP produced a partial rigor contracture in the EGTA-treated muscles. The results were consistent with the suggestion that the EGTA-treated muscles were permeable to some extent to Ca 2 + and HCP 2 - ions but not to CaEGTA 2 - and MgATP 2 -. Thus, it would seem unlikely that the [Ca 2 +], [MgATP 2 -], and [Mg 2 +] in the immediate vicinity of the myofibrils in these preparations can be adequately controlled by the solution bathing the muscles...|$|R
