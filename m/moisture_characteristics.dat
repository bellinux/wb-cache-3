40|$|To obtain soil-moisture {{characteristic}} curve experimentally is time-consuming and usually subject to considerable errors. So, many investigators {{have tried to}} predict soil-moisture {{characteristic curve}} by different models. One of these models predicts soil <b>moisture</b> <b>characteristic</b> curve based on soil particle size distribution and bulk density. In this model, soil particle size distribution curve is divided {{into a number of}} segments, each with a specific particle radius and cumulative particle mass greater than that of the radius. Using these data, soil-moisture characteristic curve was estimated. In this model, a scale factor, α, is used which may be considered as a constant, or obtained by logistic or linear procedures. The average values of α for clay, silty clay, sandy loam, two loam soils, and two silty clay loam soils were 1. 159, 1. 229, 1. 494, 1. 391, 1. 393, 1. 253 and 1. 254, respectively. For most conditions, soil particle size distribution curve is not available, but only the percentages of clay, silt, and sand could be obtained using soil textural data, which is not enough to draw a precise soil particle size distribution curve. In this situation, a precise soil particle size distribution curve must be initially developed on the basis of which the soil <b>moisture</b> <b>characteristic</b> curve can be predicted. In this study, using soil textural data of seven different soils, soil <b>moisture</b> <b>characteristic</b> curve of each was estimated.

40|$|Abstract – The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the aggregate stability of tropical soils under eucalyptus plantation and native vegetation, and assess the relationships between aggregate stability and some soil chemical and physical properties. Argisols, Cambisol, Latosols and Plinthosol within three eucalyptus-cultivated regions, in the states of Espírito Santo, Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais, Brazil, were studied. For each region, soils under native vegetation were compared to those under minimum tillage with eucalyptus cultivation. The aggregate stability was measured using the high-energy <b>moisture</b> <b>characteristic</b> (HEMC) technique, i. e., the moisture release curve at very low suctions. This method compares the resistance of aggregates to slaking on a relative scale from zero to one. Thus, the aggregate stability from different soils and management practices can be directly compared. The aggregate stability ratio was greater than 50 % for all soils, which shows that the aggregate stability index is high, both in eucalyptus and native vegetation areas. This suggests that soil management adopted for eucalyptus cultivation does not substantially modify this property. In these soils, the aggregate stability ratio does not show {{a good relationship with}} clay or soil organic matter contents.
