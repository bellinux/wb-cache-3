[...] "Harvick pulled a slide job on <b>my</b> <b>earlier</b> in the day, I crossed over and passed him clean. My guys worked way {{too hard to}} be in this position to have a wrecked race car {{at the end of the}} year. It means so much to me to finish the year strong. I talked to him in the driver’s meeting but Kevin is such a two-faced guy it doesn’t really matter," [...] Busch said. Afterward, Harvick said [...] "Kyle raced me like a clown all day." ...|$|E

"I {{am not in}} a {{position}} to corroborate Mr Lyons' account of being corrected, prompted and advised by Garda officers and his description of learning from them about the details of the admissions they were seeking. However Mr Lyons' account to me in our interview supported and was consistent with the earlier impressions I had gained from reading the case papers. In <b>my</b> <b>earlier</b> report I noted that the materials then available to me raised questions about whether the details of Mr Lyons' final admissions could have derived from the content of questions put to him during the day, rather than his knowledge and memory, and about whether he was unusually suggestible. Following my interview with Dean Lyons and his parents, these concerns are substantially strengthened and I now think that it is very likely that his detailed admissions were unreliable." ...|$|E
500|$|Gibson {{was first}} {{introduced}} to locative media websites through links from a friend, and initially found the phenomenon to be [...] "excessively nerdy and very conceptual". Despite his finding compelling {{the idea of a}} digital grid mapping the surface of the earth, Gibson saw little storytelling traction in geocaching and geohacking, and instead reworked the material into the locative art of the novel. [...] "When I started, I thought that the 'locative art' stuff would work the way immersion technology did in <b>my</b> <b>earlier</b> fiction", he commented in a subsequent interview. [...] "Then I started liking that it wasn’t going to do that." [...] The conception of the artworks in the novel was derived from the lowbrow art movement, and was inspired by the movement's talismanic Juxtapoz, the only art magazine Gibson was reading regularly at the time. The novel exhibits Gibson's characteristic brand awareness (a key plot element of Pattern Recognition), which he honed while poring over catalogues of products as part of his writing process. The author found the writing process unnerving, as the solution to the mystery of the container – the novel's MacGuffin – did not come to him until after he had written several hundred pages of manuscript.|$|E

"Russell Johnson, {{secretary}} of the NAAO [...] had an arrangement with the Henley officials that they would approve all entries from the United States, which he had made {{during his visit to}} England in the winter of 1919-20... I asked him to check with the Stewards to see if they would accept my entry because in <b>my</b> <b>earlier</b> days I had served an apprenticeship as a bricklayer. He contacted four of them and they told him to send my entry in; the war had changed the old rule and everything would be all right".|$|E

If I had to examine her evolution through time, I think she reinvented her clothing style and music with success every single time. And at the same time remained a real force in entertainment in the whole world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pandove {{started as}} a {{right-handed}} batsman, but later changed to left-hand. He did not obtain much formal cricket training, and picked up tips from his father. Sachin Tendulkar, who knew Pandove from his early career, wrote in a mail in 2011 that Pandove was a [...] "fantastic left hander {{with a lot of}} talent and class" [...] and that he [...] "had a wonderful future as a cricketer ahead of him." [...] He added, [...] "I think my association with Dhruv in <b>my</b> <b>earlier</b> cricketing days has a lot of bearing on my eventual success in the International arena." [...] Pandove's teammate Ajay Jadeja recalls Pandove as [...] "fearless" [...] with an [...] "infectious spirit to fight", while Vikram Rathour commended his maturity and intelligence about cricket.|$|E
2500|$|The Goons made a {{considerable}} {{impact on the}} humour of The Beatles, and especially on John Lennon. On 30 September 1973, Lennon reviewed the book The Goon Show Scripts for The New York Times. He wrote: [...] "I was 12 when The Goon Show first hit me, 16 when they finished with me. Their humour was the only proof {{that the world was}} insane. One of <b>my</b> <b>earlier</b> efforts at writing was a 'newspaper' called The Daily Howl. I would write it at night, then take it into school and read it aloud to my friends. Looking at it now, it seems strangely similar to The Goon Show." [...] Lennon also noted that George Martin, the Beatles' long-time producer, had previously made records with both Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers.|$|E
2500|$|Magliocco became {{interested}} in Paganism in the mid-1990s, intending to explore [...] "the confluence of ritual, festival, gender and politics [...] the subject of <b>my</b> <b>earlier</b> research in Italy [...] in a new context". Initially {{she was interested in}} Paganism as a [...] "folk revival, in issues surrounding the use of folklore from academic sources, cultural appropriation, and the construction of authenticity in the invention of rituals" [...] rather than in any actual spiritual capacity. In February 1995, Magliocco attended the first Pantheacon conference, a meeting of practicing Pagans and academics held at a hotel in San Jose, California. It was at the conference that she took part in a ritual led by members of the Reclaiming Wiccan tradition, later characterizing it as [...] "my first powerfully affecting ritual experience in a Neo-Pagan context".|$|E

Clemens commented that, [...] "When I first began to lecture, and in <b>my</b> <b>earlier</b> writings, my sole idea was to make comic capital out of everything I saw and heard." [...] Fitch told him, [...] "Clemens, your lecture was magnificent. It was eloquent, moving, sincere. Never {{in my entire life}} have I listened to such a magnificent piece of descriptive narration. But you committed one unpardonable sin—the unpardonable sin. It is a sin you must never commit again. You closed a most eloquent description, by which you had keyed your audience up to a pitch of the intensest interest, with a piece of atrocious anti-climax which nullified all the really fine effect you had produced." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sea Change {{is based}} around a musical suite of reflective, acoustic-based songs that {{showcase}} Beck's singer-songwriter side. The term sea change {{is defined as}} a broad transformation, which reflects the departure in style from both Beck's previous effort Midnite Vultures and previous, sample-based recordings, as well as Beck's desire to give each album an identity. Origins for the album's unique, passionate sound had been building up for years, according to Beck in a 2002 interview: [...] "There are threads of what I've done before. If you listen to <b>my</b> <b>earlier</b> B- sides, you'll hear this record. I have been wanting to make this record for years," [...] he explained. [...] "I've been edging towards the idea, and so it just took a while." [...] Despite initial difficulty upon deciding on the name, the title originates from [...] "Little One", the eleventh track on the album: [...] "Drown, drown / Sailors run aground / In a sea change nothing is safe".|$|E
