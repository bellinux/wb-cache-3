5|$|As {{with other}} iron alloys, around 3kg (6.5lb) metspar {{is added to}} each <b>metric</b> <b>ton</b> of steel; the {{fluoride}} ions lower its melting point and viscosity. Alongside its role as an additive in materials like enamels and welding rod coats, most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form hydrofluoric acid, which is used in steel pickling, glass etching and alkane cracking. One-third of HF goes into synthesizing cryolite and aluminium trifluoride, both fluxes in the Hall–Héroult process for aluminium extraction; replenishment is necessitated by their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus. Each <b>metric</b> <b>ton</b> of aluminium requires about 23kg (51lb) of flux. Fluorosilicates consume the second largest portion, with sodium fluorosilicate used in water fluoridation and laundry effluent treatment, and as an intermediate en route to cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride. Other important inorganic fluorides include those of cobalt, nickel, and ammonium.|$|E
5|$|Polonium is a {{very rare}} element in nature because of the short {{half-life}} of all its isotopes. 210Po, 214Po, and 218Po appear in the decay chain of 238U; thus polonium {{can be found in}} uranium ores at about 0.1mg per <b>metric</b> <b>ton</b> (1 part in 1010), which is approximately 0.2% of the abundance of radium. The amounts in the Earth's crust are not harmful. Polonium has been found in tobacco smoke from tobacco leaves grown with phosphate fertilizers.|$|E
5|$|Although faster-than-light travel {{has been}} seriously {{considered}} by physicists such as Miguel Alcubierre, Tough speculates that the {{enormous amount of}} energy required to achieve such speeds under currently proposed mechanisms means that robotic probes traveling at conventional speeds will still have an advantage for various applications. 2013 research at NASA's Johnson Space Center, however, shows that faster-than-light travel with the Alcubierre drive requires dramatically less energy than previously thought, needing only about 1 <b>metric</b> <b>ton</b> of exotic mass-energy to move a spacecraft at 10 times the speed of light, in contrast to previous estimates that stated that only a Jupiter-mass object would contain sufficient energy to power a faster-than-light spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|The Worldwide Tanker Normal Freight Scale, often {{referred}} to as Worldscale, is established and governed jointly by the Worldscale Associations of London and New York. Worldscale establishes a baseline price for carrying a <b>metric</b> <b>ton</b> of product between any two ports in the world. In Worldscale negotiations, operators and charterers will determine a price based on a percentage of the Worldscale rate. The baseline rate is expressed as WS 100. If a given charter party settled on 85% of the Worldscale rate, it would be expressed as WS 85. Similarly, a charter party set at 125% of the Worldscale rate would be expressed as WS 125.|$|E

In addition, the official US spelling for the rarely used SI prefix for ten is deka. In American English the term <b>metric</b> <b>ton</b> is the normal usage whereas in other varieties of English tonne is common. Gram is also sometimes spelled gramme in English-speaking countries other than the United States, though this older usage is declining.|$|E
5|$|These {{methods of}} steel {{production}} were rendered obsolete by the Linz-Donawitz process of {{basic oxygen steelmaking}} (BOS), developed in the 1950s, and other oxygen steel making methods. Basic oxygen steelmaking is superior to previous steelmaking methods because the oxygen pumped into the furnace limited impurities, primarily nitrogen, that previously had entered from the air used. Today, electric arc furnaces (EAF) are a common method of reprocessing scrap metal to create new steel. They {{can also be used}} for converting pig iron to steel, but they use a lot of electrical energy (about 440 kWh per <b>metric</b> <b>ton),</b> and are thus generally only economical when there is a plentiful supply of cheap electricity.|$|E
