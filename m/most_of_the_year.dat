During monsoon, the sewage treatment plants receive a high quantum of sewage which sometimes exceeds their treatment capacity. Hence, untreated or partially treated sewage is discharged into the river leading to increased BOD values observed at S 2 and S 3 mostly in the monsoon periods.|$|R

5|$|Adult elk usually stay in single-sex {{groups for}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> During the mating period {{known as the}} rut, mature bulls compete for the attentions of the cow elk and will try to defend females in their harem. Rival bulls {{challenge}} opponents by bellowing and by paralleling each other, walking back and forth. This allows potential combatants to assess the other's antlers, body size and fighting prowess. If neither bull backs down, they engage in antler wrestling, and bulls sometimes sustain serious injuries. Bulls also dig holes in the ground, in which they urinate and roll their body. A male elk's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis. The urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows.|$|E

Two weeks later, on 4 November, Kaiser {{took part in}} an expedition to the western coast of Denmark to assist two U-boats— and —that had become stranded there. On 1 December, the High Seas Fleet was reorganized; Kaiser and her sisters were transferred to the newly created IV Battle Squadron, with Kaiser as the flagship. In 1917, the policy of unrestricted submarine warfare was reinstated; the surface units of the German navy were therefore tasked with covering the departures and arrivals of the U-boats.
