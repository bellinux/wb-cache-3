5|$|West Branch Fishing Creek {{begins in}} Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 13 and southwestern Davidson Township, Sullivan County on Huckleberry Mountain. It flows northeast, almost {{immediately}} entering a valley. It soon {{picks up the}} tributaries Swanks Run and Slip Run from the left and turns southeast, its valley becoming progressively deeper. The creek continues southeast, flowing between Huckleberry Mountain and North Mountain. It picks up two more tributaries from the left and then picks up its first tributary from the right, Shingle <b>Mill</b> <b>Run.</b> Shortly afterwards, the creek turns east and begins receiving unnamed tributaries from both sides. After a few miles, Painter Run flows into the creek. The creek exits Davidson Township and Sullivan County shortly downstream.|$|E

PA669 was first designated along its current alignment in 1963 from the Maryland state line to the borough of Salisbury and the intersection with US219; the connecting road in Maryland was renumbered from MD 417 to MD 669. The two bridges PA669 uses to cross waterways in Salisbury and West Salisbury have both been deemed structurally deficient by the United States Department of Transportation. The one over the Casselman River in Salisbury was constructed in 1922 and handles an average of 1,469 vehicles per day.

The two routes split at a diamond interchange, with U.S. 12 heading south on North Clairemont Avenue and Highway 312 continuing east as the North Crossing. Highway 312 travels another 2.4 miles through the northern edge of Eau Claire, crossing over the Union Pacific, Altoona subdivision railroad tracks, before reaching the bridge over the Chippewa River. After crossing the river, Highway 312 passes under the Union Pacific, Chippewa Falls subdivision railroad tracks and comes to an interchange with North Hastings Way, a former alignment of U.S. Highway 53.

25|$|In {{its eastern}} course from Petersburg into Hardy County, the South Branch becomes more navigable {{allowing}} for canoes and smaller river vessels. The river splits and forms {{a series of}} large islands while it heads northeast to Moorefield. At Moorefield, the South Branch is joined by the South Fork South Branch Potomac River and runs north to Old Fields where it is fed by Anderson Run and Stony Run. At McNeill, the South Branch flows into the Trough where it is bound to its west by Mill Creek Mountain (2,119ft) and to its east by Sawmill Ridge (1,644ft). This area is the habitat to bald eagles. The Trough passes into Hampshire County and ends at its confluence with Sawmill Run south of Glebe and Sector. The South Branch continues north parallel to South Branch River Road (County Route 8) toward Romney {{with a number of}} historic plantation farms adjoining it. En route to Romney, the river is fed by Buffalo Run, <b>Mill</b> <b>Run,</b> McDowell Run, and Mill Creek at Vanderlip. The South Branch is traversed by the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) and joined by Sulphur Spring Run where it forms Valley View Island to the west of town. Flowing north of Romney, the river still follows the eastern side of Mill Creek Mountain until it creates a horseshoe bend at Wappocomo's Hanging Rocks around the George W. Washington plantation, Ridgedale. To the west of Three Churches on the western side of South Branch Mountain, 3,028 feet (923 m), the South Branch creates a series of bends and flows to the northeast by Springfield through Blue's Ford. After two additional horseshoe bends (meanders), the South Branch flows under the old Baltimore and Ohio Railroad mainline between Green Spring and South Branch Depot, and joins the North Branch to form the Potomac.|$|E
500|$|US 220 enters Maryland {{in southwestern}} Allegany County, {{crossing}} the Potomac River {{and its own}} old alignment on a bridge from Keyser to McCoole.

500|$|The {{drainage}} basin of West Branch Fishing Creek is {{designated as a}} High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery, except for the {{drainage basin}}s of the tributaries Shingle <b>Mill</b> <b>Run</b> and Elk Run, which are designated as Exceptional Value waters and Migratory Fisheries. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the creek. However, dry stream beds often prevent wild brook trout from migrating up the creek. Nevertheless, the creek has the highest population of wild brook trout of any major stream in the upper Fishing Creek watershed. In an electrofishing survey done by the Fishing Creek Sportsman Association, 17 sculpin, 11 wild brook trout, 7 escaped (and unidentified) trout, 6 hatchery brown trout, and 1 hatchery brook trout were observed on the creek.

500|$|Mrs Bryan and {{her husband}} were {{concerned}} about the lack of education in the area. In the early 1860s they provided two acres of land at nearby Glenore, and built a brick school and school house. The Glenore school was finished in 1862, and it was accompanied by a [...] farm whose rent was to pay for a teacher and building upkeep. A new church, for the Church of England, was built just outside Hagley. St Mary's Church of Hagley and Quamby was completed and opened in 1862. The first church continued in use as a school until 1865. In the prior year construction had begun on a public school, a two-room building with an adjacent 8-room teacher's residence; the school opened in 1865. Hagley was gazetted as a town in April 1866. By that time it had a number of stores, a blacksmith, a boot maker, a saddler, a wheelwright, two churches, two schools, two hotels, a resident seamstress and a midwife. By the late 1870s the town had gained, in addition to houses, a police station, gaol, engineering works, one steam <b>mill</b> <b>run</b> by the Noake Family and another at nearby Quamby. A rail line opened, from Launceston to Westbury, in 1871, though its station was [...] from Hagley. In the 1880s a siding was added at Hoggs Lane, and a passenger platform at the siding in 1910. Using the new rail line, by the 1880s the post office was receiving four deliveries each weekday and two on Saturday.|$|E

2500|$|Fallingwater, one of Wright's {{most famous}} private residences (completed 1937), {{was built for}} Mr. and Mrs. Edgar J. Kaufmann Sr., at <b>Mill</b> <b>Run,</b> Pennsylvania. Constructed over a 30-foot waterfall, it was {{designed}} according to Wright's desire to place the occupants close to the natural surroundings. The house {{was intended to be}} more of a family getaway, rather than a live-in home. The construction is a series of cantilevered balconies and terraces, using limestone for all verticals and concrete for the horizontals. The house cost $155,000, including the architect's fee of $8,000. It was one of Wright's most expensive pieces. Kaufmann's own engineers argued that the design was not sound. They were overruled by Wright, but the contractor secretly added extra steel to the horizontal concrete elements. In 1994, Robert Silman and Associates examined the building and developed a plan to restore the structure. In the late 1990s, steel supports were added under the lowest cantilever until a detailed structural analysis could be done. In March 2002, post-tensioning of the lowest terrace was completed.|$|E

2500|$|Mansfield had {{a cottage}} industry, which by 1800 {{consisted}} of around 700 knitting frames. It operated {{as a social}} service, {{as most of the}} workers were either orphaned children, or children from families who would otherwise be destitute. Following the invention of the [...] "water-frame", a spinning frame that was powered by a water wheel, which had been invented by Richard Arkwright in 1771 and used in his mills at Cromford, the cottage industry could not compete, and there was widespread unemployment and poverty in Mansfield. In an attempt to remedy the situation, William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, who was the landowner, and who later became Home Secretary, organised a programme of building water-powered spinning mills along the river. Hermitage Mill was the first to be built, in 1782, and still stands on Hermitage lane. Little Matlock Mill was built three years later on Sheepbridge Lane, and again still stands. Field Mill on Nottingham Road was converted to work with cotton in 1785. Immediately above it was Drury Mill, a corn <b>mill</b> <b>run</b> by Daniel Drury, but this had to be closed in 1791 when the water level in Field Mill Dam was raised, preventing Drury's wheel from working efficiently.
