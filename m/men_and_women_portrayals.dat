Topic is firstly described from the theoretical point of view, which sets the foundations for the research itself and introduces the reader to the current knowledge in this field. The following study is carried out on two different levels. Content analysis, which is used for breaking down of the essential parts of advertisement, clearly exposes the fact of gender stereotype remnants, even though the shift in certain equalizing aspects is noticeable; analysis is done upon a selected set of advertisements from regular broadcasts {{during the spring of}} 2011. Different angle towards the issue is approach using in-depth interviews with selected respondents. This method allows describing the overall understanding of <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men</b> in advertisement by receivers of television advertisements; age of members of the set ranges from 25 to 45 years, <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>men</b> with different education were equally represented, providing for absolutely unique views from all individuals. The perception of said matter is strongly influenced by sex and interest in media issues of those respondents...|$|R

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 144 - 157). Compared to disciplines like {{gender and}} health, fewer {{studies have been}} done on disabled <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women's participation in the informal sector. This may be {{explained by the fact that}} for a long time, few disabled <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> in Uganda engaged or participated openly in income generating activities (IGAs). Many started getting involved in the 1990 's and as the available literature shows, those who have done so are very enthusiastic and this has encouraged others. This study focuses on the gender and work challenges disabled <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> encounter in the informal sector of Uganda. The study is based on a review of existing literature and actual fieldwork carried out in the Mubende and Mityana districts of Uganda. It seeks to: (a) explore the types of business activities in which disabled <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> are engaged; (b) explore the nature of work challenges disabled <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> encounter in the informal sector and the nature of strategies they utilize to overcome these challenges; (c) ascertain the benefits that disabled <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> have gained in respect of participation in the informal sector; (d) establish the policies and laws that govern disabled <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> with regard to their work in the informal sector; and (e) establish how resources are allocated by various governmental and nongovernmental Organisations among disabled <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> in Mubende <b>and</b> Mityana districts. The study was carried out in Mubende and Mityana district, the central region of the densely populated disabled <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> In this study in-depth interviews and focus group methods were used to collect qualitative data. Evidence from the study confirms that disabled <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> were engaged in similar IGAs although a few of them were engaged in different IGAs. The similarity in IGAs was likely to be a result of the limited range of IGAs that disabled <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> could engage in considering the nature of their impairments, limited finances and the limited skills that they had. The visually <b>and</b> hearing impaired <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> were mainly involved in a single IGA in the informal sector and most of the physically disabled <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> were engaged in multiple IGAs. This was linked to visually <b>and</b> hearing impaired <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> lacking or having insufficient capital and skills to engage in multiple IGAs, as compared to physically disabled <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women...</b>|$|R

METHODS: Questionnaires were administered to 58 involuntary childless Turkish migrant <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> 162 involuntary childless Dutch <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> RESULTS: Individual parenthood motives were most import-ant to both Turkish migrant <b>and</b> Dutch <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> While social motives were quite important to Turkish migrants, they were unimportant to Dutch <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> Four aspects of adaptation (norms and values, social integration, skills, absence of feelings of loss related to migration) were negatively related to the importance of social parenthood motives for Turkish migrant women. For Turkish migrant men two aspects of adaptation (traditions and absence of loss) were negatively related to the importance of social parenthood motives. CONCLUSION: Turkish migrant <b>and</b> Dutch <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> differ in the importance of social motives. However, Turkish migrants who are more adapted to the Dutch culture give less importance to social parenthood motives. Key words: Dutch/infertility/migrants/parenthood motives/Turkis...|$|R
