5|$|Nevertheless, the {{bombardment}} caused {{a large number}} of casualties. Though some projectiles buried themselves in the soft soil, most found their <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reverse slope of the ridge. The bombardment forced the cavalry of the Union Brigade (in third line) to move to its left, as did the Scots Greys, to reduce their casualty rate.|$|E
5|$|Pym and Peters {{hide in the}} {{mountains}} surrounding {{the site of the}} ambush. They discover a labyrinth of passages in the hills with strange <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls, and disagree about whether these are the result of artificial or natural causes. Facing a shortage of food, they make a desperate run and steal a pirogue from the natives, narrowly escaping from the island and taking one of its inhabitants prisoner.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{have high}} <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> game's cast of characters, but were divided in their {{opinions}} of the choice of voice actors. GameTrailers's reviewer disliked that several famous X-Men and Brotherhood characters were not playable, but appeared only as side characters. They also cited issues with voice acting and a convoluted story. Unlike the critic from GameTrailers, G4's reviewer praised the overall story, and further praised the selection of characters for the cast. Greg Mueller of GameSpot also praised the game's vast cast of characters.|$|E
5|$|Several {{works of}} art bear her likeness. In 1935, Michalina Mościcka, wife of Polish President Ignacy Mościcki, {{unveiled}} a statue of Marie Curie before Warsaw's Radium Institute. During the 1944 Second World War Warsaw Uprising against the Nazi German occupation, the monument was damaged by gunfire; after the war {{it was decided to}} leave the bullet <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> statue and its pedestal. In 1955 Jozef Mazur created a stained glass panel of her, the Maria Skłodowska-Curie Medallion, featured in the University at Buffalo Polish Room.|$|E
5|$|The English Reformation inevitably {{affected}} St Helen's Church. EdwardVI's 1547 injunction {{decreed that}} all images in churches {{were to be}} dismantled or destroyed, including stained glass, shrines, roods, statues and bells, and altars were {{to be replaced by}} wooden tables. Damage during the Civil War was minimal; there are pike <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stonework. The church may have been fortified as part of the defences of the castle, a Royalist stronghold.|$|E

For example, with the 35mm lens shown above set to f/11, aligning the infinity mark with the '11' {{to the left of}} <b>the</b> index <b>mark</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> DOF scale would set the focus to the hyperfocal distance.|$|R
5|$|The {{whole of}} Scotland was {{subjected}} to glaciation during the Pleistocene epoch. A sign of this on Lismore {{is the presence of}} rock-cut platforms close to the seashore that indicate the changing sea-levels; in some areas of the northern coast they also betray the presence of ice by the striation <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rocks.|$|E
5|$|A young {{specimen}} of the Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus species (TMP 94.143.1) shows bite <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> face that were inflicted by another tyrannosaur. The bite marks are healed over, {{indicating that the}} animal survived the bite. A full-grown Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus (TMP 85.62.1) also exhibits tyrannosaur bite marks, showing that attacks to the face were not limited to younger animals. While {{it is possible that}} the bites were attributable to other species, intraspecific aggression, including facial biting, is very common among predators. Facial bites are seen in other tyrannosaurs like Gorgosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, as well as in other theropod genera like Sinraptor and Saurornitholestes. Darren Tanke and Phil Currie hypothesize that the bites are due to intraspecific competition for territory or resources, or for dominance within a social group.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{rights activists}} ransack a {{laboratory}} and unwittingly release a creature with a ferocious appetite. As they flee in an SUV, the creature follows and grotesquely mutilates them. The Fringe team consisting of FBI agents Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo), Philip Broyles (Lance Reddick), and civilian consultants Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter Bishop (John Noble) arrives, and Walter sees evidence of different creatures' <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bodies. Olivia realizes {{one of them}} is missing, and after interviewing a student at MIT to try to identify the victims, she realizes they were animal rights activists. While conducting autopsies on the bodies, an animal control team at a different site is killed by the creature after investigating a call.|$|E

5|$|Earlier restorations had {{all left}} their <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> frescoes. To {{counteract}} the whitening caused by salination, animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most {{obvious in the}} small putti which hold the nameplates on the pendentives, was saltpetre seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface. Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. This was particularly {{the case for the}} lunettes, spandrels and lower parts of the pendentives.|$|E
5|$|Sutherst {{said the}} scratch marks {{appeared}} in photographs taken on 10 September 1985, 34 {{days after the}} murders, but were not visible in the original crime-scene photographs. He also said {{he had failed to}} find in the photographs any chipped paint on the carpet below the mantelpiece, where it might have been expected to fall had the mantelpiece been scratched during a struggle. He was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot on the carpet visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece. He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes. He concluded that the scratch <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mantel had been created after the day of the murders.|$|E
5|$|That the gun had a {{silencer}} on {{it during}} the murders was central to the prosecution's case. With the silencer, the gun was too long for Sheila to have turned the gun on herself. According to the prosecution, paint on the silencer could be matched to fresh scratch <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> kitchen mantelpiece, assumed {{to have been made}} during a fight for the gun. That the silencer was found in the gun cupboard was important to the prosecution, because Sheila had no reason to return it to the cupboard before killing herself. But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police had searched the house—has blighted the prosecution's case, even though it was accepted by a majority of the jury.|$|E
50|$|At {{least two}} other blazes have been <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Leichhardt Tree. In 1893 the Dawson River flooded, {{reaching}} {{to the base of}} the Leichhardt Tree in Taroom. This level was <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tree, but is no longer visible; also a surveyor's blaze had been <b>marked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tree by August 1916. In 1925 the Irrigation and Water Supply Department surveyed the area for a proposed dam site, at which point another blaze supposedly was inscribed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tree - again no longer visible.|$|R

5|$|The Western Chalukyas minted punch-marked gold pagodas with Kannada and Nagari legends {{which were}} large, thin gold coins with several varying punch <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> obverse side. They usually carried {{multiple}} punches of symbols {{such as a}} stylised lion, Sri in Kannada, a spearhead, the king's title, a lotus and others. Jayasimha II used the legend Sri Jaya, Someshvara I issued coins with Sri Tre lo ka malla, Someshvara II used Bhuvaneka malla, Lakshmideva's coin carried Sri Lasha, and Jagadhekamalla II coinage had the legend Sri Jagade. The Alupas, a feudatory, minted coins with the Kannada and Nagari legend Sri Pandya Dhanamjaya. Lakkundi in Gadag district and Sudi in Dharwad district were the main mints (Tankhashaley). Their heaviest gold coin was Gadyanaka weighting 96grains, Dramma weighted 65grains, Kalanju 48grains, Kasu 15grains, Manjadi 2.5grains, Akkam 1.25grains and Pana 9.6grain.|$|E
5|$|The cousins {{went back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to search for the source of the red paint on the silencer. In the kitchen they found marks in the red paint {{on the underside of the}} mantelpiece above the Aga cooker. DI Cook, a scenes-of-crime officer, took a paint sample from the mantelpiece on 14 August. This was found to contain the same 15 layers of paint and varnish that were in the paint flake found on the silencer. Casts were taken of the <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mantel, and the marks were deemed consistent with the silencer having come into contact several times with the mantelpiece. The implication was that the silencer had scratched the mantelpiece during a fight for the gun.|$|E
5|$|The three-storey {{north tower}} is reached by a 13th-century {{staircase}} in the hall, which leads onto the first floor. The first floor {{was divided into}} two separate rooms shortly after {{the construction of the}} tower, and contain various decorative tiles, probably from Laurence's house in Ludlow. The walls of the second floor are mostly half-timbered, jettying out above the stone walls beneath them; the tower has its original 13th-century fireplace, although the wooden roof is 19th-century, modeled on the 13th-century original, and the windows are 17th-century insertions. The details and the carpenters' personal <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> woodwork show that the hall, solar and north tower were all constructed {{under the direction of the}} same carpenter in the late 1280s and early 1290s.|$|E

5|$|It is not {{possible}} to confirm whether some injuries took place before or after death, due to the body's state of decay. This is the case for the wound in the upper right chest and the laceration {{on the back of the}} skull. The cut on the right of the neck may have been the result of the body becoming bloated, causing the skin to split; however, the straight edges to the wound suggest that it may have been caused by a sharp instrument, such as a knife. The ligature <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> neck may have occurred after death. In some interpretations of Lindow Man's death, the sinew is a garrotte used to break the man's neck. However, Robert Connolly, a lecturer in physical anthropology, suggests that the sinew may have been ornamental and that ligature marks may have been caused by the body swelling when submerged. The rib fracture may also have occurred after death, perhaps during the discovery of the body, but is included in some narratives of Lindow Man's death. The broken neck would have proven the fatal injury, whether caused by the sinew cord tightening around the neck or by blows to the back of the head. After death, Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss face down.|$|E
5|$|James Winchester {{arrived in}} Gibraltar on January 15, to inquire when Mary Celeste might be {{released}} to deliver its cargo. Flood demanded a surety of $15,000, money Winchester did not have. He became aware that Flood thought he might have deliberately engaged a crew that would kill Briggs and his officers, as part of some conspiracy. On January 29, during a series of sharp exchanges with Flood, Winchester testified to Briggs's high character, and insisted {{that he would not}} have abandoned the ship except in extremity. Flood's theories of mutiny and murder received significant setbacks when scientific analysis of the stains found on the sword and elsewhere on the ship showed that they were not blood. A second blow to Flood followed in a report commissioned by Horatio Sprague, the American consul in Gibraltar, from Captain Shufeldt of the US Navy. In Shufeldt's view the <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bow were not man-made, but came from the natural actions of the sea on the ship's timbers.|$|E
5|$|Sirrus and Achenar beg the Stranger not {{to touch}} the green book that is stored in the same {{location}} as their final pages. They claim {{that it is a}} book like their own that will trap the Stranger. In truth, it leads to D'ni, where Atrus is imprisoned. When the book is opened, Atrus asks the Stranger to bring him a final page that is hidden on Myst Island; without it, he cannot bring his sons to justice. The game has several endings, depending on the player's actions. Giving either Sirrus or Achenar the final page of their book causes the Stranger to switch places with the son, leaving the player trapped inside the Prison book. Linking to D'ni without the page Atrus asks for leaves the Stranger and Atrus trapped on D'ni. Linking to D'ni with the page allows Atrus to complete his Myst book and return to the island. Upon returning to the library, the player finds the red and blue books gone, and burn <b>marks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shelves where they used to be.|$|E
