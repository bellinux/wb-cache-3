40|$|Poor {{design of}} low head turbine intakes {{can lead to}} a {{non-uniform}} flow incoming to the <b>machine</b> <b>inlet.</b> This can affect performance and operational features along its useful life. In most of the cases, turbine acceptance test are performed with ideal intake conditions without considering the actual upstream flow condition. This situation may result in different behavior between the model and the prototype, so it is advisable to model the flow approaching the inlet section. Such modeling is usually studied by physical modeling which can be costly and may require excessive construction and test time, especially when an optimized design is required, due to this fact is preferred CFD modeling. This work aims to propose the use of a methodology that allows the optimization of low head turbine intakes. The methodology takes as its starting point the Fisher-FrankeÂ´s [1] authors guidelines. In particular this paper shows the design optimization of a bulb intake, where the flow pattern upstream the inlet section it is not usual, so the main concern was to guarantee a high quality flow at the turbine inlet section...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{comparative}} microbiological {{evaluation of}} sanitation practices used in six Can-adian hatcheries {{was conducted by}} means of a commercially available swab kit. An assessment was made of its potential for routine use in monitoring hatchery sanitation by plant personnel. Hatcher <b>machine</b> <b>inlets,</b> exhausts, and room floors were identified as reservoirs of organisms after regular clean-up procedures had been completed. Isolated hatchery organisms were identified and the four test kit media were evaluated for their ability to exclude or support the growth of a variety of organisms. Nonselective bacteriological media in the kit were most informative for routine san-itation monitoring. A comparison between the swab kit and the direct surface agar plate techniques was undertaken in laboratory tests during which microorganisms isolated from poultry hatcheries were recovered from samples of hatchery surfaces. There {{was no significant difference between}} the two methods for recovery of Pseudomonas fragi, E, coli, Proteus, and Staphylococcus, but better recoveries were obtained for another strain of Pseudomonas and Salmonella hadar when the direct surface agar plate technique was used. Better recovery of Paecilomyces variotii was obtained when the swab kit technique was used.

40|$|LecturePg. 91 - 100 The {{natural gas}} and {{chemical}} processing industries have historically and necessarily demanded high reliability from their centrifugal compressors, {{which has led to}} a significant emphasis on field experience of designs. This emphasis has sometimes resulted in new units which reflect design and manufacturing practices which can be improved upon. Users can, in many cases, significantly increase efficiencies by considering designs which use more recently developed technologies that create only refinements of machines historically used in their applications. Accurately machined three-dimensional impellers are an example of an under-utilized available technology for multistage compressors. These designs used in several stages can provide significant efficiency gains, particularly at higher flows. At lower flows, impeller efficiencies can be improved by a process called abrasive flow machining. This process can provide similar benefits in process compressors by improving surface finish in areas that cannot be reached with conventional metal finishing techniques. Advancements in machine tool technology have also allowed changes in compressor casing designs. Numerical control (NC) machine tools can be used to <b>machine</b> <b>inlets</b> and variable area discharge volutes in the same axial casing space, thereby improving efficiencies through generous volute sizing without requiring additional diameter and bearing span. Specific examples of uses of these design and manufacturing technologies and comparisons to alternative designs are detailed. The data presented show that these technologies can be used with confidence to provide high compressor efficiencies while maintaining reliability...|$|R

40|$|PaperPg. 157 - 160. Field {{testing of}} {{compressors}} may {{be carried out}} to monitor for performance shortfall in normal operation or to verify performance following an overhaul or revamp. Testing requires careful measurements of pressures, temperatures, flows, gas composition, speed and shaft power. Testing is discussed {{with reference to the}} procedures given in ASME Power Test Code 10. Some comparison is made of shop testing versus field testing and the latter is seen as complementary to the former. In most tests, shop as well as field, shaft power is determined by the heat balance method. This method is reviewed briefly in its application to single and multiple inlet compressors. An approach for calculating overall efficiency for multiple <b>inlet</b> <b>machines,</b> where internal temperature measurements are not available, is suggested.

Main objectives of this study were to improve on the design of an existing cabinet grain dryer (to redesign the already existing cabinet grain dryer so as to: (i) Optimize efficiency at low cost (ii) Reduce total time of drying (iii) Produce viable and quality grain. Approach: The improvement on the design of the existing cabinet dryer had been achieved through proper focus on the selection of power source, materials and other design criteria for the various components of the existing one.

40|$|Small and midsize {{turbines}} {{are widely}} used in various sectors of economics for electricity generation or as mechanical drivers. The small volume flow rate of these <b>machines</b> at the <b>inlet</b> requires a small minimal passage area for the first or some upstream stages. This leads to short blade heights and small gauging angles that together compose the passage area and result in significant effi-ciency reduction. A well-known approach to avoid this is to admit steam to {{the part of the}} arc. The partial admission is widely used in the first (control) stage and sometimes even for the group of stages in small turbines. In general, the efficiency of the first partial stage and downstream located stages depends on many parameters. Some major parameters are as follows: total level of admission partiality, number and tangential location of admission arcs, and geometry of mixing chambers between first and downstream located stages. Proper combination of the above mentioned parameters may lead to improvements in turbine performance. In this article, the interaction of the control stage with partial admission and one downstream stage without partial admission for a high-speed mechanical drive turbine is considered. The compar-ison of 1 D, 2 D and CFD calculation results will be performed to reveal full 3 D flow structure influence on the performance of both stages...|$|R

In the course of this project, many changes to different aspects of the White-type cyclone design and operation were considered. These included inlet configuration, liquid delivery, porous media, surface finishes and coatings, outlet skimmer design, and cyclone body length. The final airblast atomizer cyclone (AAC) design considered has an aerosol-to-hydrosol collection efficiency cut-point of 1. 6 ?m with collection efficiencies at 2 and 3 ?m of 65 % and 85 %, respectively. The efficiency reported for the White-type cyclone for single Bacillus globigii spores that have a particle size of about 1 ?m was approximately 81. 8 %. The aerosol-to-aerosol transmission efficiency for the AAC configuration was found to be approximately 50 % for 1 ?m diameter particles as compared with 70 ? 100 % for the White-type cyclone. A time response test was performed in which the White-type (ca. 2003) cyclone had an initial response of 3 minutes for a condition where there was no liquid carryover through the cyclone outlet and 8 minutes on average with hydrosol carryover. The decay response of the White-type cyclone was 1. 25 minutes for non-liquid carryover conditions. The AAC had an initial response of 2. 75 minutes and a decay response of 2. 5 minutes. The shortened version of the AAC had an initial response of 1. 5 minutes and a decay response of 1. 25 minutes. There was no liquid carryover observed for any tests of this cyclone configuration. Power consumption tests were performed comparing pressure drops across different variations of White-type cyclones (circa 2003 and 1999) including a variation with an electrical discharge <b>machined</b> (EDM) <b>inlet</b> profile, that reduces the pressure drop at a nominal air flowrate of 780 L/min from 18 inH 2 O for the basic White-type cyclone (ca. 2003) to 16 inH 2 O with use of the EDM inlet.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown {{that the use of}} two-phase screw expanders in power generation cycles can achieve an increase in the utilisation of available energy from a low temperature heat source when compared with more conventional single-phase turbines. However, screw expander efficiencies are more sensitive to expansion volume ratio than turbines, and this increases as the expander inlet vapour dryness fraction decreases. For singlestage screw <b>machines</b> with low <b>inlet</b> dryness, this can lead to under expansion of the working fluid and low isentropic efficiency for the expansion process. The performance of the cycle can potentially be improved by using a two-stage expander, consisting of a low pressure machine and a smaller high pressure machine connected in series. By expanding the working fluid over two stages, the built-in volume ratios of the two machines can be selected to provide a better match with the overall expansion process, thereby increasing efficiency for particular inlet and discharge conditions. The mass flow rate though both stages must however be matched, and the compromise between increasing efficiency and maximising power output must also be considered. This research uses a rigorous thermodynamic screw machine model to compare the performance of single and two-stage expanders over a range of operating conditions. The model allows optimisation of the required intermediate pressure in the two- stage expander, along with the rotational speed and built-in volume ratio of both screw machine stages. The results allow the two-stage machine to be fully specified in order to achieve maximum efficiency for a required power output...|$|R
40|$|The three {{experiences}} that Ms Lupo presents {{in this book}} have the following in common: overcoming a limit, or we could say its project, as an act that profoundly triggers changes {{in the life of}} the city and its shape. All three cases deal with a limit being water. The projects for Antwerp, Venice and Copenhagen develop the concept of crossing a border. It is not simply a physical question. The limit of space is decisive but not the sole agent. The Oresund Bridge between two countries, the overflow space of Antwerpâs river and the MOSE <b>machine</b> in Veniceâs <b>inlets</b> are atypical projects. They foresee the integration of different expertise and a multiple scale dimension that goes beyond traditional planning practices. Above all, they are ecological devices that focus their full attention regarding the project design on environmental and social questions. New architectural, urban and landscape forms spring from the organisation of this ecological structure. In a certain sense, these projects break (or develop) three different borderlines. One is a physical border. The others are immaterial and deal with borders according to their scale of intervention and various areas of expertise. Everything is integrated and goes through a rethinking process. These three projects show us how it is possible to produce qualities in the city and landscape by using new and unusual instruments. Fundamentally Elisabetta Lupoâs book discusses this idea.

40|$|How to {{determine}} ionic dialysance for the online assessment of delivered dialysis dose. BackgroundIonic dialysance may be equivalent to blood-water urea clearance corrected for recirculation (effective urea clearance); however, this is controversial. The aims {{of our study}} were (1) to verify in vivo whether the value of ionic dialysance {{is affected by the}} method of determination, given the effect of cardiopulmonary recirculation on inlet plasma water conductivity when the inlet dialysate conductivity is changed; and (2) to define the operative modalities for determining ionic dialysance to obtain an adequate estimate of effective urea clearance. MethodsThirty-three hemodialysis patients were studied during 186 dialysis sessions with low-flux polysulfone dialyzers using a modified Fresenius Medical Care 4008 B machine equipped with meters to measure inlet and outlet dialysate conductivities. This <b>machine</b> varied <b>inlet</b> dialysate conductivity (Cdi) according to the following pattern: starting from baseline (step 0), Cdi was increased by 8 % (step 1). After Cdi had reached the target value, which took 8 to 10 minutes, it was lowered to 8 % below the baseline value (step 2). After 8 to 10 minutes, when Cdi had reached the new target, it was returned to its starting value (step 3). Four values of Conventional ionic dialysance (using the standard formula) and actual ionic dialysance (taking into account cardiopulmonary recirculation) were obtained for each cycle and were compared among them and with effective urea clearance (Kde). ResultsMean Conventional dialysance values at steps 0 to 2 and 2 to 3 (190 and 189 mL/min) were similar and higher than those at steps 0 to 1 and 1 to 2 (171 and 181 mL/min). Mean Conventional ionic dialysance values underestimated Kde, particularly at steps 0 to 1 (- 22. 2 mL/min, P < 0. 001) and 1 to 2 (- 12. 6 mL/min, P < 0. 001). The actual dialysance values underestimated Kde by no more than 4. 3 mL/min (P < 0. 001). In steps 0 to 1 and 1 to 2, the underestimate of Kde by Conventional dialysance increased at higher values of Kde, but this relationship did not exist when considering actual dialysance. ConclusionsThe value of ionic dialysance is affected by the method of determination, given the effect of cardiopulmonary recirculation on inlet plasma water conductivity when inlet dialysate conductivity is changed. As a consequence, to provide a correct and direct estimate of effective urea clearance, ionic dialysance must be determined by changing inlet dialysate conductivity {{in such a way as}} to keep inlet plasma water conductivity constant by means of two symmetrical high and low dialysate conductivity steps...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{two-phase}} screw expanders {{in power}} generation cycles can achieve {{an increase in the}} utilisation of available energy from a low-temperature heat source when compared with more conventional single-phase turbines. The efficiency of screw expander machines is sensitive to expansion volume ratio, which, for given inlet and discharge pressures, increases as the expander inlet vapour dryness fraction decreases. For single-stage screw <b>machines</b> with low <b>inlet</b> dryness, this can lead to underexpansion of the working fluid and low isentropic efficiency. The cycle efficiency can potentially be improved by using a two-stage expander, consisting of a machine for low-pressure expansion and a smaller high-pressure machine connected in series. By expanding the working fluid over two stages, the built-in volume ratios of the two machines can be selected to provide a better match with the overall expansion process, thereby increasing the efficiency. The mass flow rate though both stages must be matched, and the compromise between increasing efficiency and maximising power output must also be considered.

The results allow specification of a two-stage machine, using either two screw machines or a combination of high-pressure screw and low-pressure turbine, in order to achieve maximum efficiency for a particular power output. For the low-temperature heat recovery application considered in this paper, the trilateral flash cycle using a two-stage expander and the Smith cycle using a high-pressure screw and low-pressure turbine are both predicted to achieve a similar overall conversion efficiency to that of a conventional saturated vapour organic Rankine cycle...|$|R
40|$|The Thermochemical Power Group (TPG) of the University of Genoa, Italy, has {{developed}} a new flexible laboratory to study advanced energy systems based on micro gas turbine technology. In the laboratory a general-purpose experimental rig, based on a modified commercial 100 kW recuperated micro gas turbine, was installed and fully instrumented. The main objectives of the laboratory is to perform experimental activities related to gas turbine based cycles in both steady-state and transient conditions. The rig layout was defined to include the effects of interaction between the turbomachines (especially the compressor) and further components. This approach is extremely significant for innovative cycle analyses, such as recuperated, humid air, and hybrid (with high temperature fuel cells) configurations. The facility was partially funded by two Integrated Projects of the EU VI Framework Program (Felicitas and Large-SOFC) and the Italian Government (PRIN project). It was designed with a high flexibility approach including: flow control management, co-generative applications, downstream compressor volume variation, grid-connected or stand-alone operations, recuperated or simple cycles, and room temperature control. In the new EU VII Framework (E-HUB Project), the test rig has been improved with the installation of an absorption cooler to operate the system in tri-generative configuration. The layout of the whole system, including connection pipes, valves, and instrumentation (in particular mass flow meter locations) was carefully designed to measure all the significant properties with high accuracy performance. Particular attention was devoted to component design, using CFD tools (Fluent), to perform emulation tests on high temperature fuel cell hybrid systems. For this reason, the facility was equipped with a modular cathodic vessel, an anodic recirculation loop (including a vessel and an ejector), and a steam injection system for chemical composition emulation. To compare tests affected by a significant influence of the ambient temperature variation, such as the performance tests on the machine maximum electrical power and electrical efficiency or on the recuperator effectiveness, the rig was integrated with a compressor inlet temperature control system. This equipment is composed of three air/water heat exchangers located at the air intake, controlled valves and a variable speed pump operating in a closed loop. This circuit was designed to couple the <b>machine</b> air <b>inlet</b> with the absorption cooler. The large number of experimental data available for the high flexibility test rig design {{is also used to}} validate both steady-state (design and off-design) and transient (also real-time) theoretical models. A good level of consistency can be achieved thanks to the complete knowledge of the test rig dimensions, volumes, masses, shaft inertia, thermal capacitances, and operating procedure. Such completeness is difficult to obtain in industrial plants, where details about equipment are often missing or confidential. This facility is also essential to introduce undergraduate students to micro gas turbine technology, and Ph. D. s to advanced experimental activities in the same field. With this experimental rig, in addition to learning about the thermodynamic cycles and plant layouts, students can also become familiar with their materials, piping, gaskets, technology for auxiliaries, and instrumentation...|$|R
40|$|Diffusers are {{essential}} components for turbo <b>machines</b> aircraft <b>inlets,</b> combustion chambers, etc. They {{serve as a}} converter of the flow dynamic head to static pressure. This is achieved by small angle divergent walls. In combustion chamber, good mixing is essential for high burning rate. The attainment of a satisfying temperature distribution in the exhaust gases is very dependent {{on the degree of}} the combustion mixing. As long as temperature distribution enhancement has an important role to achieve good mixing, different enhancement methods have been developed by introducing a secondary flow and increasing of turbulence intensity. Swirl flow generator is one of the essential methods that are utilized to enhance the distribution rate. It can be produced by swirl generators such as helical screw-tapes, twist tapes, dimples, fins, struts etc. These generators create turbulent flow and swirling motion that can force the fluid to move {{in the direction of the}} flow and in the radial tangential direction. Helical screw-tape and twisted tape insert are an active area for the researchers to study their effects; hence they increase the turbulence intensity and have a dominant role in enhancing heat transfer and temperature distribution. In this research study, a numerical simulation analyses were undertaken in two different types of diffusers; one was a conical diffuser and one was an annular diffuser to enhance heat transfer rate by enhancing temperature distribution in a turbulent flow with air as the working fluid. This aim was achieved by using different geometric models of swirl generators such as helical screw-tape, helical screw-tape hub, pimpled hub and twisted square hub with different pitch lengths and different height lengths. The study was conducted with inlet Reynolds number 4. 3 x 10 â´ based on the hydraulic diameter and a heat source of 10 kW. The numerical analyses were carried out with the commercial software NUMECA FINEâ¢ /Open v 3. 1 as the Computational Fluid Dynamics tool. They were performed in three dimensional domains applying standard k-e model as a turbulence model. Temperature distribution was evaluated in the proposed diffusers fitted to the swirl generator models to assess the real benefits of using those types of inserts in compared to the plain diffusers at constant inlet conditions. The results show that the proposed swirl generator models have a good influence on the temperature distribution in both diffusers. It shows that the temperature distribution rate is increased with decreasing pitch length under the same operating conditions. The best temperature distribution is provided by introducing a helical screw-tape hub and a helical screw-tape in the annular and the conical diffusers respectively. The numerical simulation findings were compared with those obtained from plain diffusers and they were confirmed by experiment. Finally, correlations based on the data generated from this work to predict the temperature distribution for turbulent flow through the proposed diffusers in terms of Eckert number, pitch length ratio and height length ratio were reported. From the correlations, the best temperature distribution is achieved by the insert of helical screw-tape hub and twisted square hub in the annular diffuser...|$|R
