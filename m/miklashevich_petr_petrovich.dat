5000|$|Natalia Nikolayevna Pushkina-Lanskaya (link=no, 8 September 1812 [...] - [...] 26 November 1863) (née Natalia Nikolayevna Goncharova) (Гончарова) was {{the wife}} of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin from 1831 until his death in 1837 in a duel with Georges d'Anthès. Natalia was married to Major-General <b>Petr</b> <b>Petrovich</b> Lanskoy from 1844 until her death in 1863.|$|R
50|$|<b>Petr</b> <b>Petrovich</b> Sushkin (Петр Петрович Сушкин; 27 January 1868 - 17 September 1928) was a Russian ornithologist. He {{was born}} in Tula, Russia, and studied in Moscow before joining {{the staff of the}} Leningrad Zoological Museum in 1898, {{remaining}} there until his death. He studied birds in southeastern Russia, Siberia and the Altai Mountains. He published in English, German, and Russian, and wrote Notes on systematics and distribution of certain palaearctic birds, an influential article on bird relationships.|$|R
50|$|In 1924, {{due to the}} {{influence}} of academician <b>Petr</b> <b>Petrovich</b> Sushkin, he became interested in paleontology. Yefremov entered the Leningrad State University but dropped out later. In mid-1930s, he took part in several paleontological expeditions to the Volga region, the Urals, and Central Asia. He headed a research laboratory at the Institute of Paleontology. In 1935, he took exit examinations and graduated from the Leningrad Mining Institute. The same year he got his Candidate of Science degree in Biological Sciences. In 1941, he got his doctorate degree in Biological Sciences.|$|R

He {{won the national}} selection of Belarus with 11,475 votes on 19 January 2009 with the rock/pop song Eyes That Never Lie. The song competed in the first semi-final as the fourth act. Despite being heavily backed to win {{a place in the}} final on 16 May it failed to do so, finishing 13th of 18 acts with 25 points.|$|R
50|$|Much {{was made}} of Natalia's {{relationship}} with Nicholas I after Pushkin's death; it was even rumoured that she became his mistress. In 1843, she met <b>Petr</b> <b>Petrovich</b> Lanskoy (1799-1877), who served at the same regiment as her brother. After having been blessed by the tsar, their wedding was held in Strelna on 16 July 1844. Lanskoy was in favour with the tsar, and {{he had had a}} remarkable career before his marriage. Following the marriage, Natalia gave birth to three daughters: Alexandra (b. 1845), Elizaveta (b. 1846) and Sophia (b. 1848). Natalia died on 26 November 1863 and her ashes were laid in the cemetery of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra.|$|R
50|$|In 1921, a {{construction}} of a 32 km monorail connecting Saint Petersburg and Tsarskoye Selo was commenced. <b>Petr</b> <b>Petrovich</b> Shklovskiy {{was the author of}} that project. The monorail was planned to have gyroscopic stabilization (first patented by Brennan in 1903). The proposed monorail train consisted of a motor car and a 50-seat passenger car. The travel speed was supposed to reach 150 km/h. A 12 km monorail track was constructed in 4 months, and a Saint Petersburg factory was contracted to build a train. In May 1922, the project funding ceased. Shilovskiy went to the Great Britain where he worked for Sperry Gyroscope Company.|$|R
40|$|We use {{the form}} factors of the quantum {{transfer}} matrix in the zero-temperature limit {{in order to}} study the two-point ground-state correlation functions of the XXZ chain in the antiferromagnetic massive regime. We obtain novel form factor series representations of the correlation functions which differ from those derived either from the q-vertex-operator approach or from the algebraic Bethe Ansatz approach to the usual transfer matrix. We advocate that our novel representations are numerically more efficient and allow for a straightforward calculation of the large-distance asymptotic behaviour of the two-point functions. Keeping control over the temperature corrections to the two-point functions we see that these are of order T^∞ in the whole antiferromagnetic massive regime. The isotropic limit of our result yields a novel form factor series representation for the two-point correlation functions of the XXX chain at zero magnetic field.

40|$|Based on sources {{recently}} discovered and {{included in the}} database of scientific publications, the article analyzes the pedagogical activity of the scientist-chemist, the first rector {{and founder of the}} Ural Mining Institute in Ekaterinburg <b>Petr</b> <b>Petrovich</b> von Weymarn, whose name is now almost forgotten. The article shows that this activity can be evaluated as a pedagogical experiment on reformation of the higher education institution system, which could have been adopted in Russia if Bolsheviks lost the Civil War. Pedagogical activity of von Weymarn has a theoretical basis that he developed under the influence of Wilhelm Ostwald, the Nobel Prize winner in chemistry and the idealist philosopher, as well as the example of the Petrograd (Petersburg) Mining Institute, which for von Weymarn was not only an alma mater but an example of a reformist attitudes toward the scientific and pedagogical process in higher education. The article gives a detailed analysis of the currently available philosophical and pedagogical essays of P. P. von Weymarn, known as «Essays on the Energy of Culture», as well as the practical application of these theoretical works {{on the basis of the}} Ural Mining Institute in Ekaterinburg and in Vladivostok. With the advent of Soviet power, von Weymarn's pedagogical experiment was forcibly interrupted, and he became «persona non-grata» in the Soviet Union, but now his name is being restored. Unfortunately, he is known either as a chemist or as the founder and first rector of the current Ural State Mining University, but not as a teacher who offered his view of reforming the higher school system. This article fills this gap, revealing not only the work of von Weymarn, but also describing the difficult period of changing the old scientific school system, which could have taken a completely different development path...|$|R
