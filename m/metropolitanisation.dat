40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the recent Italian reform {{of local government}} to answer to the questions: what {{is the impact of}} <b>metropolitanisation</b> and intermunicipal cooperation on local economies and to contrast the inequalities? How does <b>metropolitanisation</b> take civil society into consideration? We focus on: 1) The peculiarities of metropolitan government in recent and ongoing reforms in Italy; 2) Public powers and competencies to realize policies for strengthening resilience in metropolitan areas. Scholars debate on indicators for spatial economic resilience and on “institutional capacity of the spatial economic system”, especially in terms of resource distribution, continuity of operational plans, political systems, public facilities. Local powers for strengthening resilience should be elaborated in the framework of the recent reforms of Metropolitan Areas government (Law 7 April 2014, no. 56). The implementation of resilience policies can need several, different and often alternative policies by new Metropolitan Cities and new “Wide Area” institutions, which arise from old District non-metropolitan institutions. We propose to study: a) local authorities involved in government and governance of metropolitan and wide areas, in juxtaposition with regional authorities; b) the reform of metropolitan “Statuti” (Statutes) and the accounting process in participatory democracy perspective; c) competencies and administrative proceedings for planning and realizing policies for strengthening resilience. We selected to test: 1) Local government of economics and, in particular, local competencies in EU State-Aids for cohesion and industrial crisis; 2) Local competencies in reorganizing regional welfare in a “capabilities approach”, contrasting the phenomenon of “resilience of welfare systems”; 3) The effects of both spending review and decentralization strengthening territorial asymmetries; 4) Local powers to limit the “state of exception” national Civil Service powers in crises; 5) Governance of local public service companies. We propose to identify the redistributive effect and the smoothing of gaps and inequalities in local areas as principal content of the strengthening of resilience of territorial policies. We propose to compare the reformed legal framework on local government in Germany, Italy and France...|$|E

Dr. Calzada invites the audience to reflect on the implications are of a growing role of city-regions on power distribution within their referential nation-states. He also invites reflection on how diverse—even divergent—city-regional political responses to the current re-scaling process of the nation-state are in fact subtly altering a refoundational momentum embracing the EU (maybe also in the UK?), who sooner or later should face ‘smart devolution’ strategies based on the ‘right to decide’ democratic experimentation practices...|$|E
40|$|From the 19 th century onwards {{urbanisation}} strongly {{marked the}} development of Great Britain with {{a majority of the}} population already being concentrated into urban areas {{before the end of the}} century. Major reform in the 1970 s introduced a scale of Metropolitan Counties in the largest English conurbations to address key strategic planning and development issues. However, these were abolished in the 1980 s under the regime of Margaret Thatcher. In the 1990 s and early 2000 s regional development and spatial planning structures emerged at the scale of ‘standard regions’ larger than the metropolitan scale. Yet from the mid- 2000 s onwards the city-regional scale again rose to prominence in the work of researchers and through initiatives driven by local government cooperation in certain large metropolitan areas – notably Manchester. Since 2010 new structures called Combined Authorities have emerged to oversee development at city-regional scale in a number of large conurbations. City regions have also been given prominence by state initiatives designed to address regional development disparities such as the so-called Northern Powerhouse.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of a creative sector {{is one of the}} features of both a structural change of the world economy and society as well as the process of advancing <b>metropolitanisation.</b> Metropolitan areas are among those where this sector develops especially dynamically, and is turning {{into one of the most}} important markers of their competitiveness. The identification of mutual interdependencies between the process of accommodating creative knowledge and a competitiveness of metropolitan regions within the enlarged European Union has become a subject of an international research project called ACRE, implemented within the EU Sixth Framework Programme. The project's central question is: What are the conditions (in particular, the role of so-called 'soft' factors) for stimulating creative urban processes? The paper presents: a) an outline of the above mentioned project in the context of R. Florida's concept of a creative class and a creative city; b) preliminary results of the project on the example of the Poznan metropolitan region; c) challenges and implications for urban policy.

40|$|This article compares three small, stateless, city-regional nation {{cases of}} Scotland, Catalonia, and the Basque Country after September 2014. Since the {{referendum}} on Scottish independence, depending on its unique context, each case has engaged differently in democratic and deliberative experimentation on the “right to decide” its future beyond its referential (pluri) nation(al) -states in the UK and Spain. Most recently, the Brexit referendum has triggered a deeper debate on how regional and political demands by these cases could re-scale the fixed (pluri) nation(al) -states’ structures while even directly advocating {{for some sort}} of “Europeanization”. Based on a broader research programme on comparing city-regional cases titled “Benchmarking City-Regions,” (www. cityregions. org) this paper argues that the differences in each of these three cases are noteworthy. Yet, even more substantial are their diverse means of accommodating smart devolutionary strategic pathways of self-determination through political innovation processes among pervasive <b>metropolitanisation</b> responses to a growing “post-national urbanity” pattern in the European Union. Ultimately, this paper aims to benchmark how Scotland, Catalonia, and the Basque Country are strategically moving forward beyond their referential (pluri) nation(al) -states in such a new European geopolitical pattern we can call “post-national urbanity” by formulating devolution, and even independence, in unique metropolitan terms...|$|E
40|$|Concern about rapid {{population}} growth in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s large cities and slower growth in many non-metropolitan areas has stimulated a range of government policies attempting to lift non-metropolitan growth rates. However, there is relatively little research {{on which to base}} these policies. It would be helpful to understand more about the consequences of current demographic trends continuing and the effects of alternative migration patterns. This paper presents sub-national population projections for Australia over the horizon 2011 – 2041, basing the projections on more socially meaningful Remoteness Areas instead of common statistical geographies. Three sets of projections were generated: a Current Direction scenario in which recent demographic trends are maintained, a Regional Immigration scenario in which more immigrants settle in regional and remote areas, and a Metro Exodus scenario in which there is increased internal migration from metropolitan to non-metropolitan areas. The future of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s population geography is shown to be one of spatially varying growth and population ageing, and continued <b>metropolitanisation.</b> In regional areas {{rapid population}} ageing will lower natural increase rates and thus reduce overall growth, resulting in a falling share of the national population. Policy measures attempting to increase the share of growth in regional areas will struggle against natural demographic forces operating in the opposite direction...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} urban {{governance and}} decentralisation in France. It explains the “quiet revolution” {{that wants to}} set the legal base of French local government {{back to the drawing}} board with special focus on the reform of local government in urban areas. The context of the too many too small communes – at the heart of the reform programme – is described since it is a typically French evil (part 2). In the absence of any successful top-down policy of amalgamating communes, new communes are deemed to be the effective solution along with a new mapping of intercommunal joint bodies (part 3). Finally, the paper describes what the metropolis “à la française” consists of (part 4) with a special focus on Lyon – the perfect model for the whole country – and Paris and Aix-Marseille as the worst pupils in transition. France stands out as an important case where new powers bestowed upon metropolitan governments have curbed the jurisdictions of regional governments. The ambiguity over the powers and functions of local governments triggers obdurate turf wars between the two levels of government, which clearly indicates that the governance of any modern society needs to be simplified. If left unaddressed, competition – not coordination or cooperation – between regionalization and <b>metropolitanisation,</b> regionalization and local governments, governability and multilevel governance is likely to become the norm. The author concludes that France desperately needs an in-depth reform of its institutional architecture, which is regularly postponed. What is required is a simplification of governmental machinery: more efficiency in local policies, a clearer allocation of responsibilities, reduced expenses, and governance closer to citizens...|$|E
40|$|In the {{beginning}} of the third millennium, most third world countries faced a trend of high urbanisation rates. Many medium-sized cities tend to be metropolitan cities, so-called <b>metropolitanisation.</b> This paper examines the urbanisation of the Kathmandu Valley and Yogyakarta and their urban growth rates despite being in different geographical plates. In addition, we also analyse the common issues with urbanisation and haphazard conversion of the agricultural land into built-up areas within the city fringes. Yogyakarta is a city in Indonesia, which is experiencing an inevitable process of urbanisation and so is the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the urbanisation process and trends in developing countries. A highly dynamic spatial pattern of urbanisation observed in Nepal and Indonesia where the spatial transformation is the main evidence that can be used to analyse the urbanisation process. The review showed the urban area increased by 142. 8 square kilometres from 1970 to 2010. The highest increasing number of urban areas occured from 1990 to 2000, dominated by fertile agricultural land beign converted into urban built-up areas. The very high increasing number of urban built-up areas do not cater for increasing population growth efficiently. In the case of the Kathamndu valley, urban built-up areas showed a slow growth trend in the 1960 s and 1970 s, dominated by agriculture urbanisation, but the growth became rapid from the 1980 s onwards. This rapid growth is guided by higher conversion of land into urban built-up areas. The urbanisation process has developed fragmented and heterogeneous land use combinations in the valley, not complimenting the natural environmental conditions. Therefore, urbanisation processes in Yogyakarta and the Kathmandu valley require planned development to best utilize resources and their potential...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} the research {{made on a}} new city brand in 2011. The Silesia Metropolis {{is a form of}} city union including 14 independent cities located in the Silesian voivodeship, Poland. In 2009 it was decided that the Silesia Metropolis is to launch a promotion campaign. The main aim of the promotion was to show the new brand and make it recognisable. However, the promotion of the Silesia Metropolis is an example of unsuccessful attempt in creating a new city brand. The building of a new city brand is a complex task, which can produce a creative and interesting vision of the city. Recent marketing arrangements of the Silesia Metropolis are facing not only the stereotypical and pop-cultural idea of the region, but also a lack of appreciation among the metropolitan residents. The Silesia Metropolis is underestimated by its own dwellers and may finally suffer serious communication problems. In this article the quality of internal space marketing in the Silesia Metropolis is therefore stated as the most important issue. Redefining traditional understanding of Silesian space (coal mines, industry, etc.) into a dynamic vision of a modern city will not accomplish success without cooperation of people. It is essential for the Silesia Metropolis to break the internal inconsistence and build a solid and cohesive structure. In order to obtain satisfying results of the study, two research methods were used: a survey and an expert interview. The metropolis’ young citizens (aged 19 - 31) whose families live in Upper Silesia for longer than one generation were subjects of the survey. The expert interviews were conducted with high-class specialists of governance, culture, <b>metropolitanisation</b> process, media communication, and marketing. The research indicates a need for change in the promotion scheme. A stronger stress should be put onto the emotional aspect of marketing communication rather than the rational explanation...|$|E
40|$|The International Metropolitan Observatory is an {{international}} network studying <b>metropolitanisation.</b> Firstly, it aims to develop a data base which will help facilitate systematic cross-national analysis of social, spatial and political shifts in metropolitan areas. Secondly, as the data base is developed, {{it can be used}} to explore hypotheses about metropolitan patterns and politics in a rigorous comparative way. A number of hypotheses were tested across the 15 country network in Phase 1 of this project. Hypothesis 1 was that metropolitan areas, consisting of cities and suburban peripheries or interlinked cities, increasingly dominate advanced industrial societies. It was also advanced that metropolitan dynamics are also increasingly present in developing countries. In South Africa this proposition was largely correct, although not to the extent that one might have imagined. Hypothesis 2 was that suburban settlement (relatively low-density ‘sprawl’) outside the central city or urban centre is increasing as a proportion of metropolitan areas, and absorbing a growing proportion of populations. If suburban settlement can be interpreted as relatively low-density outside the central cities, this hypothesis is largely valid in South Africa in that the low-density areas are increasing as a proportion of metropolitan areas. Hypothesis 3 was that with the increasing expansion beyond central city boundaries, metropolitan areas are increasingly geopolitical. In South Africa, the hypothesis that there is increasing geopolitical fragmentation in metropolitan areas is not applicable. Hypothesis 4 was that along with the above dynamics (geopolitical fragmentation), social and economic polarisation has occurred among places within metropolitan areas, especially between cities and their peripheries. The study has shown that while there is virtually no fragmentation in South African cities, social inequality has actually increased over the last 10 years. Hypothesis 5 a was that the rise of middle and uppermiddle class areas outside central cities has created new bases of support for conservative parties. Election results in South Africa seem to suggest that conservative parties do have disproportionate support in low-density fringe areas. Hypothesis 5 b was that new areas outside central cities demonstrate more independence from established party orientations or greater volatility. There was no available evidence to test this hypothesis in South Africa, but it is unlikely to be valid...|$|E
40|$|Forms in {{planning}} {{often do not}} match the forms of cities. This is important because the experience and functionings of cities are given by certain forms and not by others. In particular we are concerned here with the fact planning and design thinking often assumes a nested hierarchy of communities and spaces while the real forms of cities suggest a different diagram of how hierarchies are formed and sustained as active spaces. We ask the question what kind of forms human action and urban activity entail, and begin to answer this with a view taken from hermeneutical phenomenology that finds these mediated by technologies {{in such a way}} that what acts is the human?technology network rather than the human in a polar relation with a resistant ‘environment’. ‘Environments’ are, it is suggested, ‘technological spaces’ constructed in networks and to normative forms and scales like ‘neighbourhood’ or ‘city’. We review previous work on the role of the supergrid in constructing these forms in a process of historical development in Amsterdam. In Amsterdam infrastructure has been systematised to create networks of places in neighbourhoods, in cities (neighbourhoods and other city?scale things), and in metropolitan regions (cities and other metropolitan scaled things). This is a level of ‘planning’ that concerns normative assumptions and exists outside of the explicit concerns of planning while affecting all planning decisions at the level of sense. We conclude there is a different ‘diagram’ of urban space, consisting of three grids superimposed on each other, each of which produces a different normative element: neighbourhood, city and metropolitan region; each of which exists in part?whole relations with the others. We use this model to investigate the form of the city of Jinan in China, asking about its relevance and how we can use it to promote planning for an active public space in new towns in Jinan. Chinese planning assumes a particular form of the city and we contrast this with the actuality of activity patterns in Jinan and their historical formation. We ask how planning form needs to be translated here into urban form in order to promote public space activity in the new towns proposed and make some guidelines and suggestions for planners on how we can begin to do this. The question of why a model derived in European conditions may help us in China may be answered by the fact that both were subject of urbanisation under conditions of industrialisation and both are undergoing transformation under conditions of <b>metropolitanisation.</b> There is an open question still concerning Chinese ‘neighbourhoods’ and their definition.

40|$|Defence date: 11 June 2013 Examining Board: Professor Alexander H. Trechsel, EUI (supervisor) Professor Martin Kohli, EUI Professor R. Alan Walks, University of Toronto Professor Richard Rose FBA, University of Stratchclyde. Is {{there such}} a thing as {{suburban}} political preference in Western Europe, and if so, how is this related to political cleavages associated with geographically bound interests? What is the role of the classic urban-rural cleavage today? To answer these questions, the dissertation combines approaches from urban geography and political science to explain how the political preferences between core city and suburban voters differ in a cross-national comparative perspective. Suburbanisation has radically changed the European landscape in the 20 th century: A significant share of the population now lives in places that could be defined as suburbs instead of inner cities, small towns and villages, or the countryside. However, when it comes to questions concerning the built environment and the political sphere, a large part of political research only distinguishes between urban and rural, even though metropolitan regions now include a multitude of different places with their own characteristics and associated political beliefs and interests. Urban-suburban divergences in political preference are examined considering the close relationship between the built environment and patterns of daily life. The dissertation incorporates the idea of the social construction of spaces into an explanation of suburban electoral preferences. The study demonstrates that urban-suburban divergences are substantially based on diverging patterns of daily use of spaces, as well as to different lifestyles within the middle class. Two key aspects are relevant: the family pattern and the use of public services. First, family patterns are clearly related to the building density of the place of residence. It is postulated that in less densely constructed and populated municipalities, the organisation of daily life is easier in a breadwinner-housekeeper pattern, which is in turn linked to conservative political preferences. Second, urban inhabitants tend to rely more on public services than suburbanites, while right-wing conservative parties tend to favour the limitation of public services. The hypotheses are examined in three country case studies (Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland) that begin with an overview of the national histories of suburbanisation, showing how suburbanisation and <b>metropolitanisation</b> are related to political discourses and policy-making. In a second step, statistical analyses take into account different aspects of suburban and urban inhabitants' daily life routine related to the use public services as well as to the family pattern. The findings of the statistical analyses are interpreted in relation to the history of suburbanisation and evidence that political preferences are indeed related to daily life and the place of residence. The analyses mostly result in a suburban tendency towards the conservative side of the political spectrum as compared to inner city inhabitants, and show that suburban political preference patterns are closer to rural than to core city patterns. In a further context, the study aims to broaden the understanding of political cleavages in European democracies, particularly the urban-rural cleavage, highlighting the relationship between one of the largest changes in the European landscape over the 20 th century and the inhabitants' political preferences...|$|E
40|$|In {{choosing}} to replace Dennis Napthine with Robert Doyle the Victorian Liberals have decided on an urban {{strategy for the}} next election, writes Brian Costar This week’s replacement of Dennis Napthine with Robert Doyle as parliamentary leader of the Victorian Liberal Party occurred {{in an atmosphere of}} near electoral panic. Selective leaking, over the past fortnight, of private opinion polls commissioned by unknown “businessmen close to the Liberal Party” had the party losing up to 15 marginal Melbourne seats and giving the Labor Party control of the Legislative Council. Whether these polls were genuine or designed to undermine Dr Napthine’s leadership remains the subject of speculation. Ever since he took over as leader from Jeff Kennett {{in the wake of the}} shock loss at the 1999 election, Napthine’s leadership has been under near constant public and private scrutiny. What has previously restrained would-be challengers was uncertainty as to whether any one of their several number had sufficient votes to topple the incumbent. Robert Doyle has then passed the first test of leadership in overcoming the ambitions of others in building a majority for himself. There was precious little philosophy or policy difference between the contenders. Napthine lost the leadership because he was seen as a poor television performer who had failed to trouble the Bracks government on any significant issue. Doyle has been elevated because of the perception that he will do better in both. Given that an election is likely late this year (7 December is widely tipped) the new leader will need to move swiftly. Optimistic Liberals doubtless voted for him in the hope of winning the election; the realists are seeking to limit the extent of the expected defeat. The Bracks government has been neither spectacularly brilliant nor terminally bad. The opposition has a major task in attempting to render Labor a one-term wonder since the last time this occurred in a normal electoral contest was in South Australia in 1982 (though the collapse of the fateful Labor/Green Accord terminated the Field government in Tasmania in 1992 after only three years in office). Voters now seem willing to allow governments two terms in office, only after which are they prepared seriously to consider the alternative product - as Jeff Kennett discovered in 1999. There has been a significant redrawing of Victorian electoral boundaries since thee last election which has not favoured the ALP. If the 1999 result were to be replicated into the new boundaries then the Liberal and National Parties would have a majority of four lower house seats over the combined numbers of the Labor Party and the three independents. While this gives some encouragement to the opposition, it remains a cellar dweller in the major opinion polls which have Labor increasing its 1999 primary vote and being the major recipient of minor party and independent second preferences. One potential electoral problem created by the leadership change is that Mr Doyle, his deputy Phil Honeywood (the previous deputy, Louise Asher, having refused to serve under Doyle), and the two upper house Liberal leaders all hold Melbourne seats, whereas Napthine represented the rural seat of Portland in the far west of the state. The departure of Asher has also produced an all-male leadership in contrast to that of the ALP. While all four of Labor’s leaders also come from Melbourne, the premier and his deputy, John Brumby, have strong regional city backgrounds in Ballarat and Bendigo respectively. This regionalism is politically significant because it was the defection of voters outside Melbourne in 1999 from the Liberal and National Parties that gave Labor minority government with the support of three rural Independents. Mr Doyle would be wise to blunt this Melbourne-centric image by including somewhat more regional MPs on his front bench. The problem, however, is that he doesn’t have a long list to choose from. The twelve National Party members are ineligible because of the collapse of the coalition agreement in early 2000, and Labor’s strong provincial city and rural performance in 1999 caused the defeat of experienced non-metropolitan Liberals. And, under the charter ggreement they signed with the ALP to give it government in 1999, the independents cannot cooperate with the Liberals. The National Party is sure to try to capitalise on the <b>metropolitanisation</b> of the Liberal leadership as it attempts to reconnect with a constituency alienated by Kennett’s vigorous neoliberalism between 1992 and 1999 which the National Party ministers proved incapable of moderating. At the next election there will certainly be a return to pre-coalition, robust electoral contests between the Liberal and National Parties and, if preference exchanges are not well disciplined, Labor and/or independents may well benefit. Just as likely is a mild recovery by the National Party which had the election from hell in 1999 when it lost two seats and then a third soon after in a byelection. Whatever the Legislative Assembly outcome, the National Party is highly likely to emerge holding the balance of power in the Legislative Council. Any rumours of post-election coalitions will almost certainly be exploited by the Labor government. In {{choosing to}} replace Dr Napthine with Mr Doyle the Victorian Liberal Party has decided on an urban strategy for the next election, but, at this stage, the strategy appears defensive rather than offensive. Mr Doyle’s task is to reverse that perception. Brian Costar is associate professor of politics at Monash University. A version of this article appeared in the Ag...|$|E
