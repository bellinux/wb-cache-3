25|$|Human {{capital is}} a term popularized by Gary Becker, an {{economist}} from the University of Chicago, and Jacob <b>Mincer</b> that refers to the stock of knowledge, habits, social and personality attributes, including creativity, embodied {{in the ability to}} perform labor so as to produce economic value.|$|E
2500|$|In some way, {{the idea}} of [...] "human capital" [...] is similar to Karl Marx's concept of labor power: he thought in {{capitalism}} workers sold their labor power {{in order to receive}} income (wages and salaries). But long before <b>Mincer</b> or Becker wrote, Marx pointed to [...] "two disagreeably frustrating facts" [...] with theories that equate wages or salaries with the interest on human capital.|$|E
2500|$|The use of {{the term}} in the modern neoclassical {{economic}} literature dates back to Jacob Mincer's article [...] "Investment in Human Capital and Personal Income Distribution" [...] in the Journal of Political Economy in 1958. Then Theodore Schultz who is also contributed {{to the development of the}} subject matter. The best-known application of the idea of [...] "human capital" [...] in economics is that of <b>Mincer</b> and Gary Becker of the [...] "Chicago School" [...] of economics. Becker's book entitled Human Capital, published in 1964, became a standard reference for many years. In this view, human capital is similar to [...] "physical means of production", e.g., factories and machines: one can invest in human capital (via education, training, medical treatment) and one's outputs depend partly on the rate of return on the human capital one owns. Thus, human capital is a means of production, into which additional investment yields additional output. Human capital is substitutable, but not transferable like land, labor, or fixed capital.|$|E

Papers in the field frequently use Mincerian equations, which model wages as a function of human capital in statistical estimation. And as a result of <b>Mincer's</b> pioneering work, variables such as schooling and work experience are now the most commonly used measures of human capital.|$|R

NME, for example, assured their readers that the tensions and contradictions would continue to [...] "push and spark" [...] the KLF and that more [...] "musical treasure" [...] would be the result, but they noted: [...] " [...] himself nicely skewered on the horns of an almighty dilemma. He has taken over pop music {{and it has been}} a piece of piss to do so. And he hates that. He wants to be separate from a music industry that clasps him ever closer to its bosom. He loves being in the very belly of the beast, yet he wishes he was something that'd cause it to throw up too. He wants not only to bite the hand that feeds but to shove it into an industrial <b>mincer</b> and stomp the resultant pulp into the dirt, yet pop, as long as you continue to make it money, would let you sexually abuse its grandmother. There is, Bill old boy, no sensible way out." ...|$|E

60|$|Look at the sailor, {{called the}} <b>mincer,</b> who now comes along, and {{assisted}} by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off {{with it as}} if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter the pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as almost to double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in the rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some three feet of it, towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two slits for arm-holes at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it. The <b>mincer</b> now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling. Immemorial to all his order, this investiture alone will adequately protect him, while employed in the peculiar functions of his office.|$|E
60|$|That sort of {{development}} {{is not to}} be told in detail in a novel. I have, indeed, told much of it elsewhere. It is to be found set out at length, painfully at length, in my uncle's examination and mine in the bankruptcy proceedings, and in my own various statements after his death. Some people know everything in that story, some know it all too well, most do not want the details, {{it is the story of}} a man of imagination among figures, and unless you are prepared to collate columns of pounds, shillings and pence, compare dates and check additions, you will find it very unmeaning and perplexing. And after all, you wouldn't find the early figures so much wrong as STRAINED. In the matter of Moggs and Do Ut, as in the first Tono-Bungay promotion and in its reconstruction, we left the court by city standards without a stain on our characters. The great amalgamation of Household Services was my uncle's first really big-scale enterprise and his first display of bolder methods: for this we bought back Do Ut, Moggs (going strong with a seven per cent. dividend) and acquired Skinnerton's polishes, the Riffleshaw properties and the Runcorn's <b>mincer</b> and coffee-mill business. To that Amalgamation I was really not a party; I left it to my uncle because I was then beginning to get keen upon the soaring experiments I had taken on from the results then to hand of Lilienthal, Pilcher and the Wright brothers. I was developing a glider into a flyer. I meant to apply power to this glider as soon as I could work out one or two residual problems affecting the longitudinal stability. I knew that I had a sufficiently light motor in my own modification of Bridger's light turbine, but I knew too that until I had cured my aeroplane of a tendency demanding constant alertness from me, a tendency to jerk up its nose at unexpected moments and slide back upon me, the application of an engine would be little short of suicide.|$|E

30|$|We are {{interested}} in estimating the effects of two variables on job satisfaction; that {{is the effect of}} intra-country and inter-country wage differences. 4 The variable intra-country wage difference is constructed as the difference between the reported work earnings, which includes cash, bonuses, and in-kind payments, and the expected value of work earnings from the country’s internal wage distribution, which are calculated using <b>Mincer’s</b> (1970) earnings regression equation for each provinces of Tajikistan with division into rural and urban areas (totally 9 geographical areas). The variable inter-country wage difference is constructed as the difference between reported work earnings, which includes cash, bonuses, and in-kind payments received by non-migrating members of families of both returned in last 12  months and current migrants, and, the expected value of work earnings using parameters of the estimated <b>Mincer’s</b> earnings regression equation for current migrants. The value of the variable on the inter-country wage differences for working individuals in non-migrant families is zero, since according to our economic model, they cannot observe information on wage distributions of destination countries (by other words, the spillover effects of migration are set at zeros). This selection issue is accounted for in our semiparametric model 2 -IV (see the next section). Variables which were included in <b>Mincer’s</b> earning regression equation include individual age, gender, and levels of education.|$|R

Both the internal rate of return method and <b>Mincer’s</b> human capital earnings function method are applied. The expected private rates of return from investment in bachelor degrees increased over time for males, from 13. 1 percent in 1981 to 19. 6 percent in 2001, and then dropped to 15. 3 percent in 2006; the range was 18. 0 percent to 17. 3 percent for females over the same period. Drawing on the recent work of Heckman, Lochner and Todd (2005), this study also compares the two methods. The key difference is that the internal rate of return method can account for the effect on earnings of increased working experience associated with higher educational attainment, while <b>Mincer’s</b> method does not as it assumes parallel earnings experience profiles across different educational levels...|$|R
