5|$|Ibn Batuta, {{during his}} visit in 1344, {{observed}} that the kingdom of Jaffna was a major trading kingdom with extensive overseas contacts. The Kingdom's trades were oriented towards maritime South India, with which it developed a commercial interdependence. The non-agriculture tradition of the kingdom became strong {{as a result of}} large coastal fishing and boating population and growing opportunities for seaborne commerce. Influential commercial groups, drawn mainly from south Indian mercantile groups as well as other, resided in the royal capital, port, and market centers. Artisan settlements were also established and groups of skilled tradesmen—carpenters, stonemasons, wavers, dryers, gold and silver smiths—resided in urban centers. Thus, a pluralistic socio-economic tradition of agriculture <b>marine</b> <b>activities,</b> commerce and handicraft production was well established.|$|E

There are half a dozen small-boat marinas on the Bay side of Point Loma. There is also a commercial dock which services sport fishing cruises as well as seasonal whale watching expeditions. Point Loma hosts the biggest sport fishing fleet in Southern California. The Bay side hosts numerous other businesses related to yachting and fishing, such as marine supply stores, yacht brokerages, boat repair yards, and hotels and motels catering to fishing enthusiasts. Some restaurants and hotels have docks for customers who arrive by boat.|$|E

Today the port is located further downstream on the Shannon alongside the Dock Road and is operated by the Shannon Foynes Port Company (SFPC) who operate all <b>marine</b> <b>activities</b> in the Shannon estuary. It is a general purpose facility port. Plans to close the port and relocate all activity to the deepwater facility further downstream at Foynes have been abandoned. The plans included a major regeneration of the dockland area. Foynes is the main deepwater commercial port. SFPC is the second largest port facility in Ireland, handling over 10 million tonnes of cargo annually through the six terminals currently operational.|$|E

The 12th Service battalion would also remain to continue its role of furnishing logistic support for <b>Marine</b> <b>activities</b> in Tsingtao, and a company of 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines, was assigned to guard 1st Wing facilities at Tsangkou airfield, from which VMO-6 would operate as a reconnaissance and liaison agency for 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines.|$|E

500|$|Before the {{hurricane}}'s second landfall, another {{hurricane warning}} was issued for {{portions of the}} state, for areas of the coast from Panama City westward. Boats from Naval Air Station Pensacola were taken to nearby bayous ahead of the storm. Other ships were also sheltered as a precautionary measure. As the hurricane moved towards the Gulf Coast region, the hurricane caused strong storm surge and generated rough seas, disrupting coastal and <b>marine</b> <b>activities.</b> In Madeira Beach, the passing hurricane caused above-average tides that moved [...] further inland than normal. Offshore, two fishing boats attempting to cross Tampa Bay had to be rescued after they became stranded in the rough seas generated by the tropical storm. In Dog Island, nine people were rescued from the Cuban schooner Asturias after it washed up on the island shore. Off of Apalachicola, nine fishing boats sunk due to the waves. The tide height offshore Apalachicola {{at the time was}} [...] above average, causing damage to small craft moored at the wharves. The strong surf alone was responsible for about $1,000in damages. [...] Strong storm surge off of Pensacola caused water levels that were the highest in the area in several years. Sections of a pier at Pensacola Beach were washed away by the strong waves. Five fishermen were initially reported drowned after their fishing boat struck a reef and was swamped by the storm surge in Pensacola Bay. However, the men were later reported safe at a coast guard life saving station. The misreport was likely due a lack of communication with the station. Another three men went missing after they departed in a small boat in aid of another boat offshore Pensacola.|$|E

40|$|Mombasa and Kisite Mpunguti marine {{national}} parks and reserves (hereinafter ‘Mombasa MNPR’ and ‘Kisite Mpunguti MNPR’) consist of biodiversity rich ecosystems such as coral reefs and sea grass beds, with high ecological and economical value. <b>Marine</b> tourist <b>activities</b> taking place within these areas are connected with a risk of harming the marine environment. Mombasa MNPR and Kisite Mpunguti MNPR have the objectives of conserving marine biodiversity as well as supporting tourism. In order to properly integrate these objectives, {{it is important that}} <b>marine</b> tourist <b>activities</b> are adequately regulated. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate how <b>marine</b> tourist <b>activities,</b> directly influencing the marine environment in Kisite Mpunguti MNPR and Mombasa MNPR, are regulated. An investigation is made of environmental requirements, in legal rules as well as more informal norms (e. g. codes of conduct), and how these requirements are enforced. A legal investigation has been performed through a judicial dogmatic methodology and empirical findings have been collected through semi-structured interviews during a minor field study in Kenya. The findings of the study illustrate the roles of environmental requirements in legal rules as well as more informal norms in regulating <b>marine</b> tourist <b>activities</b> in Mombasa MNPR and Kisite Mpunguti MNPR. Legal environmental requirements that tourists and tourist activity organizers must comply with during <b>marine</b> tourist <b>activities</b> are primarily identified in provisions prescribing offences under the Wildlife (Conservation and Management) Act and the Environmental Management and Co-ordination Act, 1999. Other legal environmental requirements could also have a role in regulating <b>marine</b> tourist <b>activities,</b> but this appears unclear. It might for example be possible to prescribe legal environmental requirements in licenses or permissions, but it seems uncertain whether this is done in practice. Furthermore, the findings show that it is mainly Kenya Wildlife Service (hereinafter ‘KWS’), of the studied government agencies, that enforces legal environmental requirements in relation to <b>marine</b> tourist <b>activities</b> taking place in Mombasa MNPR and Kisite Mpunguti MNPR. The enforcement is primarily performed through supervision, education, collaboration with tourist activity organizers, warnings and suspension. KWS appears to enforce environmental requirements in legal rules as well as more informal norms. Some of these environmental requirements are applied by KWS in Mombasa MNPR as well as Kisite Mpunguti MNPR, meanwhile other requirements differ between the areas. The findings also show that, in Mombasa MNPR, environmental requirements in norms of tourist activity organizers have a role in regulating <b>marine</b> tourist <b>activities.</b> Tourist activity organizers as well as KWS seem involved in enforcing these environmental requirements. Finally, the findings illustrate that environmental requirements in different types of norms (legal rules and more informal norms) seem to interact in the regulation of <b>marine</b> tourist <b>activities</b> in Mombasa MNPR and Kisite Mpunguti MNPR...|$|R
