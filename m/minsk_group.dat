25|$|Nagorno-Karabakh is a disputed territory, internationally {{recognized}} {{as part of}} Azerbaijan, {{but most of the}} region is governed by the Republic of Artsakh (formerly named Nagorno-Karabakh Republic), a de facto independent state with Armenian ethnic majority established {{on the basis of the}} Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. Azerbaijan has not exercised political authority over the region since the advent of the Karabakh movement in 1988. Since the end of the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1994, representatives of the governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan have been holding peace talks mediated by the OSCE <b>Minsk</b> <b>Group</b> on the region's disputed status.|$|E

David Babayan, spokesperson of the Artsakhi leader Bako Sahakyan, confirmed that some of those refugees had been resettled in Artsakh. The Economist put the number of the resettled families at 30 as of June 2017. In December 2014, Armenian media cited local municipal authorities in stating that dozens of Syrian Armenian families had been resettled in the disputed zone, in particular in the city of Lachin and the village of Xanlıq in Qubadli. Azerbaijan's Minister of Foreign Affairs Elmar Mammadyarov expressed his concern over Armenia's attempts to change the demographic situation in the region and informed of his intention to raise this issue with the <b>Minsk</b> <b>Group.</b>|$|E

Though originally scheduled to launch the first commercial flights on May 9, 2011, Karabakh officials postponed a new reopening date throughout the whole of 2011. In May 2012, the director of the NKR's Civil Aviation Administration, Tigran Gabrielyan, announced that the airport will begin operations in summer 2012. However, the airport still remains closed due to political reasons. The OSCE <b>Minsk</b> <b>Group,</b> which mediates the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, reaffirmed that the operation of this airport could not be used to support any claim of a change in the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, and urged the sides to act in accordance with international law and consistent with current practice for flights over their territory.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, {{the total}} Armenian {{population}} of the districts of Kalbajar, Lachin, Qubadli, Zangilan, Jabrayil, Fuzuli and Agdam was around 1,400 people. An OSCE fact-finding mission established at Azerbaijan's request visited these regions in February 2005 with the intention to assess {{the scale of the}} settlement attempts. The mission's findings showed that these districts had as of 2005 an overall population of 14,000 persons, mostly living in precarious social conditions. It consisted primarily of ethnic Armenians displaced from non-conflict zones of Azerbaijan during the war. It was noted, however, that most of them had settled in the conflict zone after having lived in Armenia for several years and some held Armenian passports and even voted in Armenian elections. A smaller segment of the settlers were originally from the towns of Gyumri and Spitak in Armenia who had lived in temporary shelters following the devastating 1988 earthquake before moving to Karabakh, as well as a small number of natives of Yerevan who moved there for financial reasons. A field assessment mission revisited the region in October 2010, confirming that there had not been much growth in population or change in living conditions of the settlers. The Co-Chairs of the <b>Minsk</b> <b>Group</b> who visited Artsakh, Kalbajar and Lachin in 2014 reported seeing signs of improvements in infrastructure, but could not observe any indications that the size of the population had changed in recent years.|$|E

Ter-Petrosyan argued the normalization of relations with Azerbaijan and, therefore, the opening of the border with Turkey {{was the only way to}} significantly improve Armenia's economy. After the plan was publicized, he came up against strong opposition. The issue was [...] "important to the Armenians because of historical and psychological factors. After having been losing territories for centuries, the Armenians are reluctant to 'lose' Karabakh now that they have won a war against Azerbaijan." [...] According to political scientist Vicken Cheterian, [...] "By calling for major concessions on Karabakh, Ter-Petrosyan was antagonizing the last forces that supported his rule, the army and the Karabakh elite, at a time when his popularity within the Armenian society was at its lowest." ...|$|E

The referendum, {{in the view of the}} OSCE, should take place not in Azerbaijan as a whole, but in Artsakh only.

In December 1918 in <b>Minsk,</b> a <b>group</b> of roughly 1500 Poles and Belarusians under the 'Samoobrona' banner rose to arms {{to defend the}} city against the advancing forces of Soviet Russia. However, due to Russian numerical superiority and lack {{of support from the}} side of the short-lived Belarusian National Republic, the group withdrew towards central Poland. Shortly thereafter, a roughly 2,500 men strong 'Samoobrona' force was created in Wilno (modern Vilnius) to defend it against the Reds in January 1919. In the effect of four day long fights for the city, the Polish forces were pushed back and the city had to be abandoned. In the coming months the cities would change hands several times during the struggle of various factions (for example, during Vilna offensive and Operation Minsk).|$|R
