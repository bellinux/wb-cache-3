Unmetered customers are charged a flat rate independent of consumption. For unmetered residential customers the <b>monthly</b> <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> was USD 3 in Lagos, USD 5 in Katsina and USD 11 in Kaduna. In Yobe state {{it was only}} Naira 100 (USD 0.60) per month, the lowest level in the country according to the Yobe State Water Corporation.

50|$|People who cannot {{afford to}} hire their own {{personal}} assistants to run errands or answer phone calls full-time can hire a personal concierge or a part-time assistant. Most companies offer secretarial personal assistance as well as basic assistant services like research, scheduling, travel arrangements, and more.

Other companies charge a flat monthly fee for personal assistant services based upon the number of requests expected to be placed each month. In addition to the personal assistant services that are provided with the membership, other incentives such as local discounts, concierge services, dining recommendations, and overall knowledge and expertise may even outperform the skills of a regular personal assistant staff member. Newer personal assistant companies instead charge a <b>monthly</b> <b>flat</b> <b>rate,</b> which saves money.|$|E

50|$|In 1999, 44% of Canadian residences {{served by}} {{municipal}} water systems were not metered.A 2001 study of rate structures by Environment Canada {{showed that in}} 1999, 43 {{percent of the population}} was under a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> structure where the charge or assessment is fixed, regardless of the amount of water used. Another 12 percent were under a declining block rate structure (where the consumer's bill rises at a slower rate as higher volumes of water are used); i.e., the more you use, the less you pay per unit. Thus 55% of Canadians faced residential water use charges that discouraged water conservation.

40|$|Abstract — There is a {{fast growing}} number of public spaces {{offering}} Wi-Fi access to meet the rising demands for Internet access. It is common for such service to be offered to users at no charge or for a flat fee. Both situations provide very little incentive for Wi-Fi providers to offer better service to the users. Similarly, Wi-Fi providers pay a <b>monthly</b> <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> to ISP for Internet access and, this too does not incentivize ISP to offer better service to Wi-Fi users. As a result, Wi-Fi users may experience poor connection when network becomes congested during peak hours. In this {{paper we propose a}} dynamic pricing scheme for Internet access and a revenue sharing mechanism that provides incentives for both ISP and Wi-Fi providers to offer better service to their users. We build our revenue sharing model based on Shapley value mechanism. Importantly, our proposed revenue sharing mechanism captures the power negotiation between ISP and Wi-Fi providers, and how shifts in power influences revenue division. Specifically, the model assures that the party who contributes more receives a higher portion of the revenue. In addition, our simulation demonstrates that our model captures the bargaining power shifts between Wi-Fi providers and ISP, and shows that the division of revenue asymptotically converges to a percentage value.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{supply and demand}} side {{benefits}} and costs of low cost urban electrification in Mbayani Township in Blantyre City in Malawi. The low cost urban electrification program, which used compact ready boards to provide electricity to poor households in Mbayani, is the first such program in the country. The study therefore examines the strategies used to assess how they impact the service provider and the newly electrified households in terms of benefits and costs in order to draw lesson for similar programs in the future. Using an interview, the study first examines the financing and planning strategies, technologies used, tariff design and cost recovery strategies on the supply side. On users' side, the study uses a sample household survey {{to examine the effects}} of electrification on households' expenditures, fuel use and on the small and medium scale enterprises sector in Mbayani. The study conducted key informant interviews to assess community leaders' perception of the program. In addition, the study reviews the South African electrification program from which it draws lessons for Malawi. On the supply side, the strategies used reduced electrification costs and enabled the service provider to use infrastructure that was previously under-utilised. However, limited financing and planning which ignored user needs has negative implications on the program outcomes. Electricity tariffs were based on a <b>monthly</b> <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> tariff, which is likely to negatively impact on the utility's revenue. However, at the scale that the program was carried out, this impact is negligible. The tariff nevertheless ensures cost recovery over a period of 5 years. While lack of data from the utility hindered detailed analysis of the supply side impacts, the study concluded that the strategies used yielded net costs for the utility. On the demand side, the study found that electrification strategies used had a positive impact on households' energy burden and budget control and that most households have switched to electricity for lighting, powering radios and partly for cooking. Major barriers in maximising benefits are high costs of electrical appliances and poor supply quality. The study recommends that future programs should use holistic participatory planning and should diversify sources of funding. Electrification strategies must also target small and medium enterprises and promote support for acquisition of better quality appliances...|$|E

50|$|Home {{medical oxygen}} {{concentrators}} were invented in the early-1970s. Manufacturing output {{of these devices}} increased in the late 1970s. Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) and Bendix Corporation were both early manufacturers. Prior to that era, home medical oxygen therapy required the use of heavy high pressure oxygen cylinders or small cryogenic liquid oxygen systems. Both of these delivery systems required frequent home visits by suppliers to replenish oxygen supplies. In the United States Medicare switched from fee-for-service payment to a <b>flat</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>rate</b> for home oxygen therapy in the mid-1980s, causing the durable medical equipment (DME) industry to rapidly embrace concentrators {{as a way to}} control costs. This reimbursement change dramatically decreased the number of primary high pressure and liquid oxygen delivery systems in use in homes in the United States at that time. Oxygen concentrators became the preferred and most common means of delivering home oxygen. The number of manufacturers entering the oxygen concentrator market increased exponentially {{as a result of this}} change. Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) invented molecular sieve in the 1950s which made these devices possible. UCC also invented the first cryogenic liquid home medical oxygen systems in the 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|Missionaries are {{expected}} to pay their own expenses while on the mission, often with assistance from family. In the past, each missionary paid his or her actual living expenses, but this approach created a disproportionate burden on missionaries who were assigned to more expensive areas of the world. In 1990, a new program was introduced to equalize the financial responsibility for each missionary {{and his or her}} family. Now, all young missionaries pay a <b>flat</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>rate</b> which is then redistributed according to regional costs of living. The cost of a mission varies based on the country of origin of the missionary; for missionaries from the United States, the cost is US$400 per month. The monthly rate helps to cover food, lodging, transportation, and other mission related expenses. Missionaries are asked to bring extra personal money for any personal items they would like to purchase. Once the money is received by the church it is then redistributed to the missionaries in amounts proportionate to the cost of living within the assigned mission area. [...] As families now contribute to a general fund for missionary expenses, the sum is deductible under many nations' tax policies regarding charitable gifts.|$|R

In this case, the cost cap tariff is always dominated by either the pay-per-use plan or the <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> However, if consumers have uncertainty in their preferences, the cost cap tariff may generate a higher (expected) consumer surplus than a pay-per-use plan or a <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> This holds true even though consumers are charged more at the margin than in a pay-per-use tariff and the maximum possible bill amount is higher under a cost cap compared to a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> tariff. This is because the cost cap tariff does not only provide cost insurance in case of high demand (like a <b>flat</b> <b>rate),</b> but also cost flexibility in case of low demand (like a pay-per-use tariff).
