The <b>measuring</b> <b>signal</b> is directly converted into a digital signal inside the sensor. The data transmission through the cable is also digital. This digital data transmission is not sensitive to cable length, cable resistance or impedance, and is not influenced by electromagnetic noise. Standard cables can be used. b) The connection between sensor and cable can be [...] and done by inductive coupling. Humidity and related corrosion is no longer an issue.

The invention proposes the simultaneous operation of single-tone and double-tone systems for modulating and demodulating the signal of the diode laser, whereby evaluation of the <b>measuring</b> <b>signal</b> is simplified. The main feature here is that a decision can be made a priori as to which modulation or demodulation process can be given preference.

40|$|Laser Doppler anemometry is a non-intrusive {{method for}} the study of flow {{processes}} by measuring the velocity of tracer particles carried in the flow. The direction, as well as the magnitude of the flow velocity can be obtained if frequency shift techniques are employed. Conventional techniques involve a single laser source and a beam splitter to generate two LDA beams which cross in the measuring volume. A frequency shift is then introduced into one of these two beams. The alternative approach presented here involves the use of two independent laser sources, which differ in their emission frequency by a set value, giving the frequency shift. The emission line width and stability of the laser frequencies directly affect the bandwidth of the <b>measuring</b> <b>signal.</b> We show that such effects can be eliminated by correlating the <b>measuring</b> <b>signal</b> with a reference signal. The reference signal consists of a beat signal of the two laser sources which is processed to produce a reference signal pair with a phase difference of 90 between the two components. By mixing the <b>measuring</b> <b>signal</b> with this reference signal pair we obtain a sine-cosine quadrature signal which is modulated only by the Doppler frequency. This quadrature signal is independent of the shift frequency and its fluctuations. The requirements for the stability and emission line width of the laser sources are therefore significantly reduced. The quadrature signal demodulation then allows directional measurements of quasi-static flow processes with velocities of less than 0. 05 m/s corresponding to very small Doppler frequencies of 10 kHz or less.
