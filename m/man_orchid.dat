5|$|From 2007 to 2012, {{the number}} of round-leaved {{wintergreen}} footage increased by 50 percent. On the other hand, those of <b>man</b> <b>orchid</b> fall suddenly and continually. Whereas 27 plants were counted in 2003, the number reached a peak of 240 in 2006 with the uprooting of the wood small-reed, before collapsing to 13 plants in 2012, despite the continued management. The observation of gnawed seedlings can assume leaf consumption by herbivores. Protection against rodents was established in 2013 and will be evaluated at flowering.|$|E
5|$|The {{preservation}} of the existing diversity {{was the most important}} goal. It required conservation of the heritage plant communities: tall-herb fen with common butterbur, the chasmophytic vegetation with hart's-tongue fern and the woody fringe Lathyro sylvestris – Astragaletum glycyphylli. The survival of populations of round-leaved wintergreen and of <b>man</b> <b>orchid,</b> the two most interesting plants, was also a priority, as a strikeout against brush invasion in the open areas where bee orchid and pyramidal orchid grow. The natural forest dynamics are to be contained within areas of clear undergrowth or fringes with these species: common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid. Pioneer areas with mushrooms should be preserved and the invasive species contained. Artificial infrastructures (ruin, concrete pylons, walls and rock piles) should be utilized for the creation of new habitats.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{a sloping}} dry chalk bank, which has {{a wide variety of}} plants, {{butterflies}} and birds. Plants include the pyramidal and <b>man</b> <b>orchids,</b> and the greater yellow-rattle, which is rare nationally. Over 100 species of moth and 36 of butterfly have been recorded. It also has scrub with wild privet, dogwood and the wayfaring tree. Sheep graze on the grassland as part of the Surrey Downs Project.|$|R

50|$|Queendown has {{the usual}} plants of chalk grassland, and orchids are well represented, {{particularly}} the fragrant orchid, with scattered groups of early spider, bee and <b>man</b> <b>orchids.</b> Later {{in the year}} autumn lady's-tresses may be found. A good variety of chalk grassland butterflies {{can be seen in}} summer, including the Adonis Blue, re-introduced in 2002. At the bottom of the bank, there is a colony of rabbits which, together with grazing cattle, help to maintain the short sward, essential for the maintenance of many orchid populations. The West Bank has several patches of fly orchid and white helleborine in the scrub and woodland edges. Some particularly good examples of the many large beech trees on the reserve can be seen in this section.|$|R
5|$|Twelve of {{them were}} {{inventoried}} in 2003, and their populations have been managed since. The light undergrowth contains common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii) and round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia). Liquorice milkvetch (Astragalus glycyphyllos) and narrow-leaved everlasting-pea (Lathyrus sylvestris) {{are present in the}} small herb glade. The population of lesser butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia) is located in the pioneer wood. In the glade with Calamagrostide and at the boundary of a pioneer grove grow pyramidal orchid (Anacamptis pyramidalis). bee orchid (Ophrys apifera) and <b>man</b> <b>orchid</b> (Orchis anthropophora) grow everywhere, except in the older glade. In the different herbaceous fringes grow wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) and zigzag clover (Trifolium medium). A tall herb fringe hosts common butterbur (Petasites hybridus).|$|E
5|$|Wood small-reed (Calamagrostis epigejos) {{is present}} {{in the center of the}} site and threatens to spread into {{herbaceous}} areas. It compromises sustainability of stations, including <b>man</b> <b>orchid</b> and bee orchid populations. Two distinct zones can be distinguished. The first, where the wood small-reed has a very high rate of recovery, is not hosting any heritage value. It is mowed early and disposed of. Grazing is not possible at the moment. The second, on the contrary, not densely colonized by this plant is much more of a fragile situation due to the presence of orchids and the sickle-bearing bush cricket or long-horned groundhopper. Differentiated management is applied depending on the issues. At orchid stations, slight thinning is done early by hand pruning. The less dense areas where the grass is sparse (conducive to the long-horned groundhopper (Tetrix tenuicornis)) are pulled. In the newly opened areas, a systematic and annual pulling avoids expansion. Finally, dense areas, well exposed, are left in that state.|$|E

When he was working well he found himself in that happy state--the happiest of all for an artist--in which things in general contribute to the particular idea and fall in with it, help it on and justify it, so that he feels for the hour as if nothing in the world can happen to him, even if it come in the guise of disaster or suffering, that will not be an enhancement of his subject. Moreover there was an exhilaration (he had felt it before) in the rapid change of scene--the jump, in the dusk of the afternoon, from foggy London and his familiar studio to a centre of festivity in the middle of Hertfordshire and a drama half acted, a drama of pretty women and noted <b>men</b> and wonderful <b>orchids</b> in silver jars. He observed as a not unimportant fact that one of the pretty women was beside him: a gentleman sat on his other hand. But he went into his neighbours little as yet: he was busy looking out for Sir David, whom he had never seen and about whom he naturally was curious.|$|R

5000|$|References to {{the power}} and allure of the wild orchid are {{peppered}} throughout the world's cultural, historical, and contemporary beliefs. As {{far back as the}} fifth century BC, the Chinese philosopher Confucius used wild orchids as symbolism to deepen the meaning of his poems; [...] "he compared the virtuous <b>man</b> to an <b>orchid.</b> Echoing this thought, Chinese artists sometimes placed orchids in their work to evoke the Confucian qualities of humility, integrity, refinement—in fact, all the virtues of a perfectly cultured gentleman and scholar." [...] "The ancient Greeks associated it with virility, and the Aztecs were said to drink a mixture of the vanilla orchid and chocolate to give them power and strength." [...] To others, [...] "orchids possess a sensual, quasi-mystical aura: thought of as sexual, wild, rare creatures." [...] In the 1939 book The Orchid Hunters, Norman MacDonald wrote: [...] "For when a man falls in love with orchids, he'll do anything to possess the one he wants. It's like chasing a green-eyed woman consumed by desire or taking cocaine. A sort of madness..." [...] In a 2002 NOVA interview, Susan Orlean (Author, The Orchid Thief, non-fiction) revealed her research findings: [...] "Nothing in science can account for the way people feel about orchids. Orchids arouse passion more than romance. They are the sexiest flowers on Earth."And in 2006, an article about [...] "Fanatical collectors driving a £6 billion black market of 'trophy' specimens" [...] was published in The Telegraph. In this article, Eric Hansen (Author, Orchid Fever, non-fiction) recalls a flower-grower telling him: 'You can get off alcohol, drugs, women, food and cars, but once you're hooked on orchids you're finished.
