After completing her education as a physiotherapist, Papert left her home in Saxony, Germany in 1993 and moved to Berchtesgaden, Bavaria in the Alps. It was only there that she discovered her interest in the mountains. She began to learn about hiking, biking and skiing before moving on to mountain climbing. Her first major mountain climb was in 1996 on Watzmann (2713m), which is the highest peak which is entirely within Germany. On 22 August 2000 she became a mother to her son Emanuel. In 2006, she won the overall Ice Climbing World Cup, and over the years she won the world cup three more times.

A third group of <b>mixed</b> <b>grade</b> was recognised in 11 patients with low grade who also had occasional areas of high grade.

Low grade tumours occurred mainly in men with a history of several years, and who presented with non-specific gastric symptoms without remarkable exploratory or laboratory findings: most patients were in stage IE-IIE and achieved remission and cure. High grade can have a shorter history, systemic symptoms, abnormal exploratory and laboratory findings, gastric tumour masses, stage IV disease, and a worse outcome. The only significant prognostic factors for survival were the type of lymphoma and stage IV disease. These findings support the Isaacson classification system which separates two extreme groups of gastric lymphomas with different morphology, behaviour, and outcome. The presence of limited areas of high grade in a specimen showing low grade does not change the outcome but suggests that primary gastric lymphoma forms a continuum between these extreme types...|$|E

40|$|Objective:To {{determine}} the {{factors associated with}} downgrading between biopsy and prostatectomy in the contemporary era using extended-template biopsy techniques. Materials and methods:The UCSF Urologic Oncology Database was used to identify subjects diagnosed with high grade prostate cancer (primary pattern 4 or 5) {{in at least one}} core on extended-pattern biopsy. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent factors associated with downgrading at radical prostatectomy, defined as a change from primary pattern 4 or 5 to primary pattern 3. Results:Downgrading occurred in 68 (34 %) of 202 subjects who met the study criteria. Fourteen (47 %) of 30 subjects with ≤ 25 % of cores that were high grade and 9 (43 %) of 21 subjects with < 10 % of total tissue containing cancer were downgraded. In a multivariable model, patients with <b>mixed</b> <b>grade</b> cores had much higher odds of downgrading than those with all high grade cores (OR 3. 0 95 % 1. 3 - 7. 1), P < 0. 01). The proportion (per 10 % increment) of positive cores containing high grade cancer (OR 0. 8 95 % CI 0. 7 - 0. 9 P < 0. 01) and the percent (per 10 % increment) of total tissue containing cancer (OR 0. 7 95 % CI 0. 6 - 0. 9 P = 0. 01) were significantly associated with lower odds of downgrading. Conclusions:Downgrading following radical prostatectomy is a common event. Biopsy over-grading may preclude men from active surveillance or lead to unnecessary lymphadenectomy, excess radiation, or prolonged hormone therapy. The proportion of positive biopsy cores that are high grade and the percent of total tissue containing cancer should be incorporated into decision making. © 2013 Elsevier Inc...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigated the}} effects of the cross age peer tutoring relationship when students in both the tutor and tutee roles were underachieving. The targeted population consisted of students who attended a charter school in the southwestern United States. Two studies were conducted: one in science and one in reading. Primarily, the goal was to investigate a model of cross-age peer tutoring that would benefit underachieving students in the content area of reading. Students who are underachieving in reading often struggle in other content areas as well, so finding a way to increase reading achievement in at-risk schools that lack funding and resources is of utmost importance to a child’s overall education. The first study, in the content area of science, was aimed at understanding if underachieving students could be placed in tutor roles to close gaps in their achievement. Sixteen middle school students (14 boys and two girls) in a <b>mixed</b> <b>grade</b> class (sixth through eighth) were trained to deliver a science curriculum to elementary students. The overall findings in this first study suggest that the tutors demonstrated significant gains in knowledge acquisition after having the opportunity to teach the material to the younger students. Findings also suggest that the act of teaching had a positive impact on the tutors’ attitudes towards learning about water conservation and in their valuing of water conservation. The second, larger study, in the content area of reading, paired underachieving middle school students with underachieving elementary students for a shared reading experience in which the middle schools students acted as tutors and were trained to focus on specific parts of the reading process to help the elementary students increase their reading achievement. This study consisted of 64 tutors (27 seventh graders and 37 eighth graders) and 77 tutees (26 Kindergarteners, 16 first graders, 12 second graders, and 23 third graders). The overall findings in this study demonstrate significant gains in reading for both the tutors and tutees. Although the investigations in this dissertation were limited in terms of sample size and lacked control groups, the results suggest that overall, cross-age tutoring is a way to help at-risk students become more engaged in their own educations and provide resource-challenged schools with a viable resource within their own walls...|$|E
40|$|Background: Currently, New Zealand elite Touch {{players are}} {{ranked in the}} top two {{countries}} around the world in all three playing grades (Men's, Women's and Mixed). As of January 2010, New Zealand holds the mantle of World Champions in the Mixed (Open, Masters, Under 21) and Men's (Under 21 and Under 18) grades. Determined to obtain this same achievement at future Elite Open World Cup competitions, relevant and specific training programmes need to be implemented. Time-Motion Analysis (TMA) can provide this information by means of qualitative and quantitative measurements of individual performance during a game. There are a limited number studies on the physical demands of elite Touch players during competition and the majority have focused on male and female Touch players who play in a Men's only or Women's only grade. To date, there have been no investigations on the physical and technical demands of New Zealand elite Touch players, or elite Touch players who specialise in playing in a <b>Mixed</b> <b>grade.</b> Purpose: The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the physical and technical demands of elite Touch players and determine if any differences exist across the three playing grades and various Touch player groups. Methods: Twenty male (mean ± SD: age 23. 4 ± 3. 8 years; height 174. 9 ± 6. 1 cm; body mass 75. 3 ± 8. 1 kg) and 18 female (mean ± SD: age 23. 9 ± 3. 7 years; height 165. 9 ± 5. 0 cm; body mass 63. 9 ± 5. 6 kg) elite Touch players participated in this study. Physical and technical game measures, included video footage (playing time, sport specific skill analysis), and GPS data (Time-Motion Analysis) information were obtained during one competition game at the Touch New Zealand (TNZ) Open National Tournament. Blood lactate concentrations were also taken before and after each game, using a portable finger-stick blood lactate concentration meter. Physiological profiles of each Touch player were conducted within two weeks of competing at the TNZ Open National Tournament and included assessment of speed (5 -, 10 -, 20 -, 30 -m sprint times) and estimated maximal aerobic power (20 m Multi-stage shuttle run test). Results: For each playing grade the overall mean time period spent 'on and off the field ratios' during a game was, male only ~ 1 : 1. 10, male mixed ~ 1 : 1. 75, female only ~ 1 : 1. 40 and female mixed ~ 1 : 1. 20. Across all grades male mixed players spent significantly (p 0. 05) in age, height, body mass, sprint speed and predicted V 02 max were found between middle, link and utility playing positions. However, when comparing between gender groups across the three playing positions, male utility Touch players were significantly, heavier and faster than all female positional groups (~ 16 – 18 % and ~ 7 – 8 %, respectively). Conclusion: It is obvious from the results of the present study that there are several physical and technical game measurement differences and similarities across the three playing grades and with various Touch player positional groups during competition. The results also show that male elite Touch players who play in a Men's only grade are different to female Touch players (on many anthropometric and performance variables). Such data is useful as it provided some indication of the different requirements of the different elite Touch players and grades. These results provide some initial normative anthropometric and physiological data for elite New Zealand Touch players. The project also provides some initial physical and technical game measurement data for elite New Zealand Touch players which can be used as benchmarks for coaches and support staff when planning their athletes training programmes and by sports scientists for further research...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Linear {{programming}} {{has been}} widely applied in the secondary hardwood dimension manufacturing industries to solve the least-cost lumber <b>grade</b> <b>mix</b> problem, which refers {{to the search for}} minimal raw material costs. Most existing models are based on the assumption of a simple linear relationship between lumber <b>grade</b> <b>mix</b> and yield. However, this crucial assumption has never been veri®ed. In this study, the results from a ®ve-factor mixture design statistically proved that none of the cutting bills tested has a simple linear relationship between yield and di erent lumber <b>grade</b> <b>mixes.</b> It was observed that cutting bill characteristics and lumber quality a ect the relationship between yield and lumber grades. Cutting bills that require wider and/or longer parts tend to behave non-linearly. In addition, the more dissimilar lumber grade qualities that are processed, the more likely is the occurrence of a non-linear response. The inability to predict the relationship between yield and lumber grades, coupled with the high percentage of non-simple linear relationships observed in this study, brings into question the validity of the linearity assumption applied in previous linear programming models. Further e orts are needed to construct a new least-cost lumber <b>grade</b> <b>mix</b> model that does not rely on the assumption of a simple linear relationship between lumber <b>grade</b> <b>mix</b> and yield...|$|R
