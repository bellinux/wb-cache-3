5|$|It {{was found}} that Choor Singh had two private {{contacts}} with a <b>material</b> <b>witness</b> {{in the course of}} the disciplinary proceedings, even though it is a well-established rule that a decision-maker should not have contact with any party to the proceedings or any of his witnesses in the absence of the other party or his counsel. The High Court found that there was no actual bias, but there was evidence on which reasonable people might believe that Choor Singh might or could not bring an unprejudiced mind to the disciplinary inquiry. The key finding was that the two private contacts with the <b>material</b> <b>witness</b> gave an appearance of a real likelihood of bias. On this basis, the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the disciplinary committee. The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath (1992).|$|E

2500|$|The {{members of}} an inquiry {{tribunal}} should not communicate independently or privately to any <b>material</b> <b>witness</b> unless they are disclosed straightaway to the parties concerned. In Re Low Fook Cheng Patricia (1998), the appellant, a lawyer, applied to set aside a sanction for misconduct imposed on her by the Law Society of Singapore.

2500|$|Members of a {{tribunal}} {{should not}} communicate independently or privately to any <b>material</b> <b>witness.</b> If they do so, {{the fact that}} communication has occurred must be disclosed to the parties concerned right away. The justification for this rule {{is that it would}} be unfair for a person to be judged on an issue based on information obtained by an adjudicator which is unknown to that person. In Re Low Fook Cheng Patricia (1998), a lawyer appealed to set aside the penalty for misconduct imposed on her by the Law Society of Singapore. The appeal was based on the ground that the chairman of the Inquiry Committee had contacted a witness to enquire if the witness could assist the committee in its inquiry, but this was not made known to the appellant. Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck considered such an act of private communication with a <b>material</b> <b>witness</b> as [...] "pierc the veritable armour of impartiality which every tribunal exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions must don". Thus, the penalty imposed by the Law Society was set aside.|$|E
