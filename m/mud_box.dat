The <b>mud</b> <b>box</b> is a small perforated screening box fitted to the suction pipe in the bilge of a ship, and is designed to catch larger solid waste before it can choke the pipeline and potentially damage the pump.

40|$|In Senegal and the Gambia high post-harvest {{losses are}} {{incurred}} {{because of the}} groundnut seed beetle caryedon serratus which infects groundnuts while they are drying off in the field. The On-Farm Seed Project (OFSP) and the Peace Corps AFSI Project in these two countries are currently conducting experiments to combat this pest. Different methods to be tried include: drying off the around {{and away from the}} field, storage in sand to reduce space and oxygen for the insects; storage in ash, which damages the exoskeleton of the insects; treatment with storage insecticides; storage in neem leaves which have insecticidal properties; and storage in sealed <b>mud</b> brick <b>boxes.</b> Results will be judged primarily on germination rate next season and also on comparative costs, labour, and availability of materials. They will be published in 'Seed Sowers', the newsletter of the OFSP.
