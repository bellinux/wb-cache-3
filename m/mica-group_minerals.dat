40|$|The Thor Lake rare-metal (Y-REE-Nb-Ta-Zr-Be) deposit, {{located about}} 100 {{kilometers}} southeast of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada, {{is regarded as}} one of the largest high field strength elements (HFSE, including Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, Ti, Y, and the lanthanides) deposits and hosted by alkaline granite and syenite. The T Zone deposit, one of the main mineralized zones at Thor Lake, is characterized by HFSE mineralization that has intimate connection to hydrothermal activities. The T Zone at Thor Lake provides an excellent opportunity to assess the mobility and precipitation of HFSE in magmatic-hydrothermal systems. The T Zone has been identified as a pegmatite that experienced multiple alteration stages. Most HFSE minerals were hydrothermally formed, as indicated by their occurrence in pseudomorphs. The most important precursor minerals for those HFSE-rich and Be-rich pseudomorphs are aegirine and <b>mica-group</b> <b>minerals.</b> The HFSE concentrations in aegirine and mica are not sufficiently high. Therefore, a dissolution-reprecipitation model cannot explain the presence of zircon and other HFSE minerals that pseudomorph aegirine. Rather, the addition of HFSE by hydrothermal fluids is required. Mass transfer calculations show that HFSE were added or removed during different alteration events. Related to the identified alteration events, the remobilization patterns of HFSE reveal that transport and precipitation of HFSE in the T Zone was likely caused by fluids with different characteristics. Magmatic and various types of hydrothermal zircon are characterized by different trace element chemistry. Titanium-in-zircon geothermometer was employed to constrain the mineralizing temperatures of the T Zone. The crystallization temperatures for the magmatic zircon from the host granite range from 792 to 1195 °C. Extremely high Ti concentrations in hydrothermal zircon from the T Zone prevent the application of Ti-in-zircon geothermometry. Primary fluid inclusion assemblages (FIAs) related to precipitation of various HFSE minerals in the T Zone were identified. Microthermometric analysis has revealed that there were likely two populations of fluids in the T Zone. According to fluid inclusion LA-ICP-MS analysis and EDS decrepitate analysis, the fluids responsible for HFSE transport in the T Zone contain significant HFSE, are aqueous and dominated by Na and Cl with trace amounts of CO 2 and CH 4...|$|E
40|$|Slab-derived fluids play a {{key role}} in mass {{transfer}} and elemental/isotopic exchanges in subduction zones. The exhumation of deeply subducted crust is achieved via a subduction channel where fluids from various sources are abundant, and thus the chemical/isotopic compositions of these rocks could have been modified by subduction-zone fluid–rock interactions. Here, we investigate the Mg isotopic systematics of eclogites from southwestern Tianshan, in conjunction with major/trace element and Sr-Nd isotopes, to characterize the source and nature of fluids and to decipher how fluid–rock interactions in subduction channel might influence the Mg isotopic systematics of exhumed eclogites. The eclogites have high LILEs (especially Ba) and Pb, high initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (up to 0. 7117; higher than that of coeval seawater), and varying Ni and Co (mostly lower than those of oceanic basalts), suggesting that these eclogites have interacted with metamorphic fluids mainly released from subducted sediments, with minor contributions from altered oceanic crust or altered abyssal peridotites. The positive correlation between 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and Pb* (an index of Pb enrichment; Pb* = 2 *PbN/[CeN + PrN]), and the decoupling relationships and bidirectional patterns in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr-Rb/Sr, Pb*-Rb/Sr and Pb*-Ba/Pb spaces imply the presence of two compositionally different components for the fluids: one enriched in LILEs, and the other enriched in Pb and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr. The systematically heavier Mg isotopic compositions (δ 26 Mg = − 0. 37 to + 0. 26) relative to oceanic basalts (− 0. 25 ± 0. 07) and the roughly negative correlation of δ 26 Mg with MgO for the southwestern Tianshan eclogites, cannot be explained by inheritance of Mg isotopic signatures from ancient seafloor alteration or prograde metamorphism. Instead, the signatures are most likely produced by fluid–rock interactions during the exhumation of eclogites. The high Rb/Sr and Ba/Pb but low Pb* eclogites generally have high bulk-rock δ 26 Mg values, whereas high Pb* and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr eclogites have mantle-like δ 26 Mg values, suggesting that the two fluid components have diverse influences on the Mg isotopic systematics of these eclogites. The LILE-rich fluid component, possibly derived from <b>mica-group</b> <b>minerals,</b> contains a considerable amount of isotopically heavy Mg that has shifted the δ 26 Mg of the eclogites towards higher values. By contrast, the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr- and Pb-rich fluid component, most likely released from epidote-group minerals in metasediments, has little Mg so as not to modify the Mg isotopic composition of the eclogites. In addition, the influence of talc-derived fluid might be evident in a very few eclogites that have low Rb/Sr and Ba/Pb but slightly heavier Mg isotopic compositions. These findings represent an important step toward a broad understanding of the Mg isotope geochemistry in subduction zones, and contributing to understanding why island arc basalts have averagely heavier Mg isotopic compositions than the normal mantle...|$|E
