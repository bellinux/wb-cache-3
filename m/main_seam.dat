50|$|A turnshoe {{is a type}} of shoe, made of leather, {{that was}} used during the Middle Ages. It was so named because it was put {{together}} , and then was turned right-side-out once finished.

25|$|The fashion {{house had}} begun with 50 staff, but swelled {{over time to}} over 1,200 staff. This was work that {{required}} painstaking attention to detail, finesse and craftsmanship – a Worth bodice might have up to 17 pieces of material to ensure the perfect fit to its wearer. Seamstresses would be assigned to different workshops where they specialized in, for instance, making sleeves, stitching hems or skirt making.

50|$|For woven textiles, grain {{refers to}} the {{orientation}} of the weft and warp threads. The three named grains are straight grain, cross grain, and the bias grain. In sewing, a pattern piece can be cut from fabric in any orientation, and the chosen grain or orientation will affect the way the fabric hangs and stretches and thus the fit of a garment. Generally speaking a piece is said to be cut on a particular grain when the longest part of the pattern or the <b>main</b> <b>seams</b> of the finished piece are aligned with that grain. Non-woven materials such as felt, interfacing or leather do not have a grain.|$|R
50|$|The {{coalfield}} {{is composed}} of four <b>main</b> <b>seams,</b> only one of which, the No. 1 Seam, is currently being mined, below surface, using bord and pillar mining methods and continuous miners. No pillar extraction occurs, and the mine design is conservative to prevent surface subsidence. The No. 1 Seam has an average height of 8.5 meters (28 ft), an average CV of around 23.5 MJ/kg (air-dry) and is located at an average depth of 80 meters (260 ft) below surface. Production over a recent 7-year stretch averaged 877,000 tonnes per year. Overall coalfield resoures within the mining lease area estimated at 5 billion tonnes of coal.|$|R

50|$|While the <b>main</b> <b>seam</b> can be 'picked at' - {{loosening}} {{the threads}} — {{in order to}} create conventional swing when the ball is relatively new, more recently, an understanding has evolved that the quarter seam can be lifted on one side, presumably with the thumb or finger nails, to enable the operation of reverse swing on an already scuffed ball.|$|E

5000|$|Coal mining {{has been}} {{associated}} with this area of north east England for many hundreds of years. It is believed that monks from nearby Hulne Priory were mining coal in the area from around the 12th century and written survey records, held by the Newcastle Society of Antiquaries, exist from the 1500s of transactions involving the transfer of ownership of coal mines and mining rights. There are three <b>main</b> <b>seams</b> of coal in the Shilbottle area of Northumberland, the Townsend, Cannel and Shilbottle and these have been mined in various ways for many hundreds of years at various locations, resulting in multiple spoil heaps becoming part of the countryside over time.
