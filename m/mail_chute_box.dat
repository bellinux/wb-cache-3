5000|$|In {{more recent}} decades, {{buildings}} such as Chicago's John Hancock Center, the Chrysler Building, {{and the old}} RCA Building in New York City have shut down their chutes. The reason is the increase of modern mail rooms in the building lobby with associated mail boxes available for the building tenants. There remain, however, about 360 buildings in Chicago with <b>mail</b> <b>chutes,</b> and more than 900 active chutes exist in Manhattan and the Bronx of New York City alone, as well as elsewhere. Since 1997, however, the National Fire Protection Association has banned <b>mail</b> <b>chutes</b> in all new building construction.

This innovation was before {{the time of the}} modern [...] "mail room" [...] normally associated nowadays with high rise buildings. It was for the convenience of the users of the building so they would not have to take their mail to an outside mail box or to the post office.|$|R

It was designed by Lafaye, Lafaye, and Fair for local businessman Frank Owen, {{and was the first}} skyscraper built in the city after World War II. Its primary tenant for many years was Southern Bell Telephone Company, who in 1961 constructed an annex to the building to house computer equipment. It was purchased by the Seibels Bruce Insurance Company, another major tenant, in 1980. The building exterior has been relatively little-altered since its construction, and it retains some of its early internal features, including a period <b>mail</b> <b>chute.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Built {{of brick}} {{covered with a}} slate roof, the Romanesque Revival {{building}} features elements of stone and terracotta.

[...] The building was designed by Peters and Burns, a Dayton-based architectural company, and constructed {{under the direction of}} Dayton contractors Beaver and Butt. During the building's early years, it was home to companies such as the Manhattan Clothing Store and Oleman's Department Store, which maintained premises there in the 1890s and 1910s respectively. [...] However, the building was not always used for commercial purposes; an arts school operated in the building during the 1888-1889 schoolyear.

5000|$|Fire spread was {{initially}} {{hampered by the}} stair arrangement. While the stairs were not closed off by doors, the configuration placed ascending and descending runs {{around the corner from}} each other, keeping fire and hot gas from quickly ascending the stair. Fire did not spread through the enclosed elevator shafts, nor through the laundry or <b>mail</b> <b>chutes.</b> [...] Open transoms between the rooms and the corridors admitted fresh air for combustion, eventually creating a flue-like effect with the fire climbing to all but the two top floors. Once established in the corridors, the fire fed on the burlap wallcoverings and ignited room doors and transoms. Doors and transoms were burned through on all but the fourteenth and fifteenth floors. Guests opened windows seeking fresh air and rescue, further enabling the draft of fresh air to the fire. The fire investigation revealed that an open transom was closely associated with the ignition of a given guest room and its contents.|$|R
5000|$|Unfortunately, after {{a little}} over a decade of turning the Menger Hotel into San Antonio’s finest, William Menger died in 1871. However, Mary and her son Louis William {{continued}} to run the hotel and brewery. Mary quickly ran an announcement in the local newspaper letting San Antonio know that she would carry on the business and her husband’s death “would cause no change in affairs” within the hotel or brewery. Mary was quick to go about business as usual and she made plans to further enlarge the hotel to continue to service the huge influx of guests she was receiving. She bought neighboring land in order to achieve her goals of adding additional rooms to the hotel. In a one-year period Mary hosted more than 2000 guests in her hotel and on one night alone the hotel housed 165 guests. Her success was undeniable, despite the death of her husband. Mary helped the hotel achieve great success. On February 19, 1877, the first train steamed into San Antonio, which further contributed to the growing success of the hotel. This allowed for a higher volume of travelers through San Antonio and it began to further promote the growth of the Alamo Plaza. Because of its growth, Alamo Plaza would become the location of San Antonio’s first federal post office which opened in 1877. The hotel offered a <b>mail</b> <b>chute</b> on each floor that allowed guests to simply slip <b>mail</b> into the <b>chute.</b> It would be collected and then taken to the post office to be mailed. Mary was aware that the hotel was lacking in the latest technologies such as bathrooms, proper water closets or bells. She quickly took it upon herself to make the necessary adjustments to the establishment.|$|R
50|$|The {{changing}} fire {{life safety}} requirements for high rise flats caused Edgewater Towers {{to be treated}} as a test case for fire life safety and Edgewater Towers was required to install an improved fire life safety system by the Port Phillip Council in the late 1980s. The Port Phillip Council required Edgewater Towers to have a further fire life safety upgrade in 2002 and was subsequently fitted with a fire sprinkler protection system and fully addressable automatic fire detection and alarm system between 2005 and 2008, and certified complete 2014. The earlier fire life safety upgrade between 1989 and 1995 included fire hose reels, a smoke and heat detection system, enclosure of the previously open West stairwell, sealing of floor penetrations, closure of the <b>mail</b> <b>chute,</b> emergency and exit lighting, removal of glazed timber doors in the corridors, modifications to both stairs to discharge directly to outdoors, fire rated doors, fire rated enclosed balcony ends and blocking up corridor clerestory glazing to each flat to achieve the necessary 1-hour fire-resistance rating. The sprinkler fire protection system was activated in August 2013, when a fire started on a balcony on the 11th. floor. The Age newspaper carried the story.

Overall building dimensions of 154 feet x 44 feet x 147 feet high (46m x 13m x 44m high). The building originally contained 100 flats with shops, {{a restaurant and}} offices on the ground floor. Each floor contained four one bedroom and four two bedroom flats. The ground floor restaurant [...] "The Reef" [...] (which had a nautical theme with fishing nets and other nautical paraphernalia) and later a milk bar with counter and café seating , until the early 80s was converted to a three bedroom flat in the mid-1980s. A Kiosk planned for the lobby was never operated as one and was converted for bike storage (24 bikes) in the mid-1990s. The lobby is elevated to capture the bay and park views and features cantilevered roof canopies above both entrances, clerestory windows above a curved wall of Castlemaine slate, terrazzo flooring and columns of blue and pink mosaic glass tiles. Copper mail boxes are original (Originally external, relocated inside shortly after Edgewater opened and integrated into the recycled timber screen in 2012). Many original features of the building such as the curved privacy screen before the two public restroom doors, resident directory board (black felt with white plastic letters), rockery planter with green plastic curtain/screen, open West stairwell, corridor clerestory glazing for borrowed daylight and <b>mail</b> <b>chute</b> were removed or closed off during fire life safety upgrades. The original very heavy swinging glass and timber entrance doors were replaced with aluminium framed glazing and automatic sliding doors in 2014. The original Architect's Ground Floor Plan drawing notes entrance doors as 'Aluminium Frame' though they were never installed. When opened Edgewater Towers was fitted with two waste incinerators as there was no managed garbage truck collection {{in place at the}} time. The incinerators were removed in a fire life safety upgrade and are now stairwell fire exit paths direct to outside. Facing Marine Parade, the building originally had a large illuminated fluorescent white plastic sign [...] "Edgewater Towers" [...] in red gothic script (Blackletter) until it was brought down by a storm in 1988. There is parking on grade for 95 cars at the East end of the building including 12 undercover car ports; the maximum covered area allowed to maintain the required minimum 300 square feet (28 square metres) of open space per flat. The original plans for the building were lost when fire gutted the St Kilda Town Hall and partial plans are stored in the State Library of Victoria.|$|R
