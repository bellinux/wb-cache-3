25|$|Arbuscular mycorrhizas are {{characterized}} by the formation of unique structures, arbuscules and vesicles by fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota. AM fungi help plants to capture nutrients such as phosphorus, sulfur, nitrogen and micronutrients from the soil. It is believed {{that the development of}} the arbuscular <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>symbiosis</b> {{played a crucial role in}} the initial colonisation of land by plants and in the evolution of the vascular plants.|$|E
500|$|The <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>symbiosis</b> is ancient, {{dating to}} at least 400 million years ago. It often {{increases}} the plant's uptake of inorganic compounds, such as nitrate and phosphate from soils having low concentrations of these key plant nutrients. The fungal partners may also mediate plant-to-plant transfer of carbohydrates and other nutrients. Such mycorrhizal communities are called [...] "common mycorrhizal networks". A special case of mycorrhiza is myco-heterotrophy, whereby the plant parasitizes the fungus, obtaining all of its nutrients from its fungal symbiont. Some fungal species inhabit the tissues inside roots, stems, and leaves, in which case they are called endophytes. Similar to mycorrhiza, endophytic colonization by fungi may benefit both symbionts; for example, endophytes of grasses impart to their host increased resistance to herbivores and other environmental stresses and receive food and shelter from the plant in return.|$|E
2500|$|Increased {{interest}} in <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>symbiosis</b> {{and the development}} of sophisticated molecular techniques has led to the rapid development of genetic evidence. [...] Wang et al. (2010) investigated plant genes involved in communication with order Glomales fungal partners (DMI1, DMI3, IPD3). [...] These three genes could be sequenced from all major clades of modern land plants, including liverworts, the most basal group, and phylogeny of the three genes proved to agree with then current land plant phylogenies. This implies that mycorrhizal genes must have been present in the common ancestor of land plants, and that they must have been vertically inherited since plants colonized land.|$|E

40|$|In the arbuscular <b>mycorrhizal</b> (AM) <b>symbiosis,</b> plants take {{up part of}} the {{nitrogen}} (N) through a mycorrhizal pathway. In this study, we assessed the effect of different N sources on the expression of genes coding for enzymes and transporters of the mycorrhizal N uptake pathway, using Sorghum bicolor and Glomus intraradices as a model. Some of the genes investigated were differentially regulated in the intraradical and in the extraradical mycelium depending on the N source. In AM roots, some fungal and plant genes were co-regulated, suggesting an interdependence of both partners in the mycorrhizal N uptake pathway.

40|$|The arbuscular <b>mycorrhizal</b> (AM) <b>symbiosis</b> {{represents}} {{the most widely}} distributed mutualistic root symbiosis. We report that root extracts of mycorrhizal plants contain a lipophilic signal capable of inducing the phosphate transporter genes StPT 3 and StPT 4 of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), genes that are specifically induced in roots colonized by AM fungi. The same signal caused rapid extracellular alkalinization in suspension-cultured tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cells and induction of the mycorrhiza-specific phosphate transporter gene LePT 4 in these cells. The active principle was characterized as the lysolipid lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) via a combination of gene expression studies, alkalinization assays in cell cultures, and chromatographic and mass spectrometric analyses.

In the present work, we present background data on strigo-lactones from studies on their seed germination activity on the parasitic weeds Orobanche and Striga, the importance of nitrogen and phosphorus for this seed germination activity, and what this could mean for AM fungi. We also present results on the susceptibility of plants to AM fungi and the possible involvement of strigolactones in this AM susceptibility and discuss the role of strigolactones for the formation and the regulation of the AM symbiosis as well as the possible implication of these compounds as plant signals in other soil-borne plant–microbe interactions...|$|R
40|$|Fossilized fungal hyphae and spores {{from the}} Ordovician of Wisconsin (with {{an age of}} about 460 million years) {{strongly}} resemble modern arbuscular mycor-rhizal fungi (Glomales, Zygomycetes). These fossils indicate that Glomales-like fungi were present {{at a time when}} the land ßora most likely only consisted of plants on the bryophytic level.

40|$|To {{estimate}} {{dynamics of}} arbuscular <b>mycorrhizal</b> (AM) <b>symbiosis</b> in heavy metal (HM) phytoremediation, {{we conducted a}} literature survey and correlated HM uptake and relative plant growth parameters from published data. After estimating AM feedback responses for these parameters at low and high soil-HM concentration intervals, we determined that the roles of AM symbiosis are characterized by (1) an increased HM phytoextraction via mycorrhizospheric ‘Enhanced Uptake’ at low soil-HM concentrations, and (2) a reduced HM bioavailability via AM fungal ‘Metal-Binding’ processes at high soil-HM levels, hence resulting in increased plant biomass and enhanced plant tolerance through HM stress-avoidance. We present two conceptual models which illustrate the important compromise between plant growth, plant HM uptake and HM tolerance, and further {{emphasize the importance of}} AM symbiosis in buffering the soil environment for plants under such stress conditions...|$|R
