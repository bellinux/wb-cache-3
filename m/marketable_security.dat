40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to examine investment decisions made by managers of firms having {{a portion of their}} assets committed to projects classified (for financial accounting purposes) as investments in marketable securities, and the corresponding consequences of such decisions on the firm. Of particular concern are managers' decisions to select investment alternatives emphasizing non-optimal investment projects, as suggested by a speculative intent. The research focuses on two main issues: (1) identifying the environment most conducive to finding the existence of <b>marketable</b> <b>security</b> investments; and (2) the effect on firm performance of holding various levels of this type of investment. Results provide support for the existence of investments in marketable securities in settings where an abundance of investment opportunities exist. This finding is consistent with the notion that growth firms have more incentive to smooth earnings and are in continual need of funding for profitable investment projects. The results also indicate that, compared to firms with no investments, firms with a relatively low level of investments in marketable securities have higher firm performance. However, as the level of <b>marketable</b> <b>security</b> investment increases beyond this threshold, the performance of the firm eventually declines below that of no-investment firms...|$|E

The purpose of our study is to examine the nature of deviations of securitized real estate from its underlying fundamental value and the role that institutional flow of funds play in this process. Towards this end, we also explore whether the transformation of real estate into a <b>marketable</b> <b>security</b> generates a dual persona for REITs with respect to its market movements. We find support for the notion that REIT returns display a dual persona, with REITs going through periods where they trade like real estate, and other periods where they trade like common equity, preferred stock or corporate debt.

Because of the put option, the seller generally receives a premium price for the security. The issues are whether the seller-transferor should account for the transfer as a sale or as a borrowing and, if the transfer is accounted for as a borrowing, whether impairment of the asset should be recognized.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDIn {{this thesis}} we study {{a range of}} related {{commercial}} banking problems in discrete and continuous time settings. The ﬁrst problem is about a capital allocation strategy that optimizes the expected future value of a commercial bank’s total non-risk-weighted assets (TNRWAs) in terms of terminal time utility maximization. This entails ﬁnding optimal amounts of Total capital for investment in different bank assets. Based on the optimal capital allocation strategy derived for the ﬁrst problem, we derive stochastic models for respectively the bank’s capital adequacy and liquidity ratios {{in the second and}} third problems. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) introduced these ratios in an attempt to improve the regulation of the international banking industry in terms of capital adequacy and liquidity management. As a fourth problem we derive a multi-period deposit insurance pricing model which incorporates the optimal capital allocation strategy, the BCBS’ latest capital standard, capital forbearance and moral hazard. In the ﬁfth and ﬁnal problem we show how the values of LIBOR-in-arrears and vanilla interest rate swaps, typically used by commercial banks and other ﬁnancial institutions to reduce risk, can be derived under a specialized version of the affine interest rate model originally considered by the bank in question. More speciﬁcally, in the ﬁrst problem we assume that the bank invests its Total capital in a stochastic interest rate ﬁnancial market consisting of three assets, viz., a treasury security, a <b>marketable</b> <b>security</b> and a loan. We assume that the interest rate in the market is described by an affine model, and that the value of the loan follows a jump-diffusion process. We wish to ﬁnd the optimal capital allocation strategy that maximizes an expected logarithmic utility of the bank’s TNRWAs at a future date. Generally, analytical solutions to stochastic optimal control problems in the jump setting are very difficult to obtain. We propose an approximation method that exploits a similarity between the forms of the control problems of the jump-diffusion model and the diffusion model obtained by removing the jump. With the jump assumed sufficiently small, the analytical solution of the diffusion model then serves as a proxy to the solution of the control problem with the jump. In the second problem we construct models for the bank’s capital adequacy ratios in terms of the proxy. We present numerical simulations to characterize the behaviour of the capital adequacy ratios. Furthermore, in this chapter, we consider the approximate optimal capital allocation strategy subject to a constant Leverage Ratio, which is a speciﬁc non-risk-based capital adequacy ratio, at the minimum prescribed level. We derive a formula for the bank’s TNRWAs at constant (minimum) Leverage Ratio value and present numerical simulations based on the modiﬁed TNRWAs formula. In the third problem we model the bank’s liquidity ratios and we monitor the levels of the liquidity ratios under the proxy numerically. In the fourth problem we derive a multi-period deposit insurance pricing model, the latest capital standard a la Basel III, capital forbearance and moral hazard behaviour. The deposit insurance pricing method utilizes an asset value reset rule comparable to the typical practice of insolvency resolution by insuring agencies. We perform numerical computations with our model to study its implications. In the ﬁnal problem, we specialize the affine interest rate model considered previously to the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) interest rate dynamic. We consider ﬁxed-for-ﬂoating interest rate swaps under the CIR model. We show how analytical expressions for the values of both a LIBOR-in-arrears swap and a vanilla swap can be derived using a Green’s function approach. We employ Monte Carlo simulation methods to compute the values of the swaps for different scenarios. We wish to make explicit the contributions of this project to the literature. A research article titled “An Optimal Portfolio and Capital Management Strategy for Basel III Compliant Commercial Banks” by Grant E. Muller and Peter J. Witbooi [1] has been published in an accredited scientiﬁc journal. In the aforementioned paper we solve an optimal capital allocation problem for diffusion banking models. We propose using the solution of the Brownian motions control problem of [1] as the proxy in problems two to four of this thesis. Furthermore, we wish to note that the methodology employed on the ﬁnal problem of this study is actually from the paper [2] of Mallier and Alobaidi. In the paper [2] the authors did not present simulation studies to characterize their pricing models. We contribute a simulation study in which the values of the swaps are computed via Monte Carlo simulation methods...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{examining}} the systems of accounting for <b>marketable</b> <b>securities</b> in Nigeria {{with a view}} to determine the impact of the accounting systems and the classification of <b>Marketable</b> <b>Securities</b> (MS) on the financial performance of banks. To achieve the above objective research questions were raised, hypotheses were formulated, and a review of related literature was made. In order to generate the necessary data for this study, data were sourced from the financial statements of banks and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) statistical bulletin for a period of 15 years, i. e. 1995 – 2009. The data generated for the study were analyzed with the multiple regression analysis. Our findings indicated that, the unrealized gains arising from the classification of MS as current asset is a reduction to net income while the unrealized gains arising from the classification as non-current asset is a reduction to net asset. Based on the above findings, it was recommended that where <b>marketable</b> <b>securities</b> are debt instruments; they should be classified as current asset (temporary investment).

40|$|Working Capital {{management}} {{is an important}} aspect of financial management in most firms. Working Capital is the sum of current assets in a firm which provide profitability and liquidity to a firm. Profitability ensures that funds are employed efficiently to generate a maximum rate of return. Liquidity enables the firm to satisfy its financial obligations and avoid bankruptcy. The major current assets which comprise working capital are cash, <b>marketable</b> <b>securities,</b> accounts receivable, and inventory. The current liabilities that detract from working capital are accounts payable, accruals and short-term borrowing. A survey was sent to 65 financial executives to determine the current trends in implementing working capital techniques. Each respondent was asked to supply information about his/her company's annual revenues, industry, cash management policies, <b>marketable</b> <b>securities</b> investments, accounts receivable control, inventor, management and short-term borrowing. Many interesting observations were made based on the data collected from the surveys. Among these observations are the following: The most important features of a cash management system are cost, improvement in float, ease in implementation and consistency of results; the most important characteristics of <b>marketable</b> <b>securities</b> are safety, yield, maturity and marketability; most firms devote a lot of effort to control accounts receivable and reduce delinquent accounts; and the majority of companies feel that a good relationship with a commercial lender is important in obtaining short-term funds. The most important observation was that all companies use working capital management. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Applied Mathematics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The {{subprime}} mortgage crisis (SMC) is {{an ongoing}} housing and nancial crisis that was triggered by a marked increase in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures in the U. S. It has had major adverse consequences for banks and nancial markets around the globe since it became apparent in 2007. In our research, we examine an originator's (OR's) nonlinear stochastic optimal control problem related to choices regarding deposit inflow rates and <b>marketable</b> <b>securities</b> allocation. Here, the primary aim is to minimize liquidity risk, more speci cally, funding and credit crunch risk. In this regard, we consider two reference processes, namely, the deposit reference process and the residential mortgage loan (RML) reference process. This enables us to specify optimal deposit inflows as well as optimal <b>marketable</b> <b>securities</b> allocation by using actuarial cost methods to establish an ideal level of subprime RML extension. In our research, relationships are established in order to construct a stochastic continuous-time banking model to determine a solution for this optimal control problem which is driven by geometric Brownian motion. In this regard, the main issues {{to be addressed in}} this dissertation are discussed in Chapters 2 and 3. In Chapter 2, we investigate uncertain banking behavior. In this regard, we consider continuous-time stochastic models for OR's assets, liabilities, capital, balance sheet as well as its reference processes and give a description of their dynamics for each stochastic model as well as the dynamics of OR's stylized balance sheet. In this chapter, we consider RML and deposit reference processes which will serve as leading indicators in order to establish a desirable level of subprime RMLs to be extended {{at the end of the}} risk horizon. Chapter 3 states the main results that pertain to the role of stochastic optimal control in OR's risk management in Theorem 2. 5. 1 and Corollary 2. 5. 2. Prior to the stochastic control problem, we discuss an OR's risk factors, the stochastic dynamics of <b>marketable</b> <b>securities</b> as well as the RML nancing spread method regarding an OR. Optimal portfolio choices are made regarding deposit and <b>marketable</b> <b>securities</b> inflow rates given by Theorem 3. 4. 1 in order to obtain the ideal RML extension level. We construct the stochastic continuoustime model to determine a solution for this optimal control problem to obtain the optimal <b>marketable</b> <b>securities</b> allocation and deposit inflow rate to ensure OR's stability and security. According to this, a spread method of RML financing is imposed with an existence condition given by Lemma 3. 3. 2. A numerical example is given in Section 3. 5 to illustrates the main issues raised in our research. Master...|$|R
