40|$|The food habits, {{movement}} and activity patterns, and habitat use of sympatric carnivores, and wildlife harvest and utilization, were {{studied at the}} Taohong Village, Jiangxi Province, southeastern China during 1992 – 1996. ^ Food habits of four species of sympatric carnivores were studied by scat analysis. Crab-eating mongooses (Herpestes urva) had the most diversified diet that included many water-edge food items. <b>Masked</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civets</b> (Paguma larvata) consumed {{a large proportion of}} fruits. Both small Indian civets (Viverricula indica) and hog badgers (Arctonyx collaris) fed heavily on rodents. Though there was a certain degree of difference in habitat use among these species, the rather high diet overlap suggested that the population densities of these species were reduced to a very low level by constant harvest pressure and secondary poisoning so that the diet ceased to have relevant effect on the sympatry of these species. The food habits (based on scat analysis) of the sympatric dhole (Cuon alpinus) and wolf (Canis lupus) showed that their depredation on the endangered Sika deer (Cervus nippon kopschi), domestic animals and small carnivores was negligible. ^ Telemetry studies showed that small Indian <b>civets,</b> <b>masked</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civets,</b> and crab-eating mongooses did not have permanent dens but moved among their numerous daybeds. Small Indian civets used daybeds among the bushes and grass on the ground while other species used underground dens exclusively. Small Indian civets and crabeating mongooses limited their activity to the foothills at low altitude, while <b>masked</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civets</b> included habitat of higher altitude in their home ranges. Both small Indian <b>civets</b> and <b>masked</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civets</b> were nocturnal, but the latter had a low activity level in the daytime. Crab-eating mongooses were active in the daytime. ^ Ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) were strictly nocturnal. Their daybeds included both natural and man-made sites. The lack of direct conflict of interest with humans allowed them to live in close proximity to human settlement. ^ Wildlife harvest during the 1992 / 96 harvest seasons was studied by the method of participant observation. Wildlife harvesters comprised 1. 5 % of the local population, and a few professional harvesters accounted for {{a large proportion of the}} game yield. Shotguns and two kinds of traps were the most common harvest methods used. Muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) and hares (Lepus sinensis and L. capensis) were the most important game species. In spite of the steady increase in the price of wildlife parts, the game yields experienced a gradual decline due to reduced harvest efforts. Wildlife harvest was market-oriented and played an insignificant supplemental role in the local economy. Marketing channels for both pelt and game meat have been well established and are spreading. Wildlife harvest remained largely unregulated. The prospect of wildlife harvest at Taohong is discussed and recommendations to control harvest are proposed. ...|$|R
40|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) {{was caused}} by a novel virus now known as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The discovery of SARS-CoV-like viruses in <b>masked</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civets</b> (Paguma larvata) raises the possibility that civets play a role in SARS-CoV transmission. To test the susceptibility of civets to experimental infection by different SARS-CoV isolates, 10 civets were inoculated with two human isolates of SARS-CoV, BJ 01 (with a 29 -nucleotide deletion) and GZ 01 (without the 29 -nucleotide deletion). All inoculated animals displayed clinical symptoms, such as fever, lethargy, and loss of aggressiveness, and the infection was confirmed by virus isolation, detection of viral genomic RNA, and serum-neutralizing antibodies.

40|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) -associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiological {{agent of}} SARS. It {{is believed that}} SARS-CoV originates from wild animals. We have developed a multitarget real-time Taqman reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay for the quantitative detection of SARS-CoV.

The overall linear range of this assay was from at least 101 to 106 copies per reaction, and the detection limit could reach less than 10 copies per reaction. The quantification results for SARS-CoV from cell culture correlated well with those of the RT-PCR by using any two of the three sets of primer and probe used in this assay. However, the results of quantification of SARS-CoV obtained by using a few available throat swab specimens from SARS patients and the N gene as the target were almost 10 times higher than those obtained by using ORF 3 and ORF 8.

40|$|Fourteen {{wild species}} of shrubs and {{trees in the}} {{dioecious}} genus Ilex occur in Hong Kong (22 °N, 114 °E). All species flowered and formed fruits once each year. Sex ratios at flowering were male biased {{in all but one}} large population studied and, in most cases, this bias could not be explained by earlier flowering in males or higher female mortality. Apis cerana accounted for > 87 % of flower visits in all species and there was a significant positive relationship across species between the number of visits per flower per hour and the estimated mean number of flowers on a plant. The large green fruits of Ilex chapaensis Merr. were consumed only by <b>masked</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civets,</b> Paguma larvata, while the red or black fruits of other species were consumed by birds. The rate of fruit removal across species was positively related to sugar content and negatively related to phenolic and saponin contents. The mean number of pyrenes per fruit was 4. 0 - 6. 2 and the mean percentage of pyrenes containing seeds was 49 %- 90 %. Most embryos were immature (heart shaped) at fruit maturity, but < 50 % of embryos developed further in some species.

40|$|Given the {{potential}} for laboratory-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections, we must know which cell lines are susceptible to the virus. We investigated 21 cell lines routinely used for virus isolation or research. After infection with SARS-CoV, cells were observed for cytopathic effects, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction {{was used to measure}} ongoing viral replication. An indirect immunofluorescence assay was also used as a confirmatory test. The study identified 10 new cell lines capable of supporting the replication of SARS-CoV and confirmed the susceptibility of 4 cell lines previously reported. This study shows that SARS-CoV can be isolated in several cell lines commonly used for diagnostic or research purposes. It also shows that SARS-CoV can achieve high titers in several cell lines, sometimes in the absence of specific cytopathic effects. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first observed in 2002 when cases of a life-threatening atypical pneumonia occurred in Guangdong Province, China (1). A novel coronavirus (CoV), designated SARS-CoV, was quickly identified as the etiologic agent (1, 2). Although the origins of the virus have not been established, evidence suggests that it is an animal virus that was recently transmitted to humans (3). Several wildlife species consumed as delicacies in southern China, including Himalayan <b>masked</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civets,</b> Chinese ferret badgers, and raccoon dogs, possess antibodies consistent with natural infection with related CoVs (4). Unlike the other currently recognized human CoVs, HCoV- 229 E, HCoV-OC 43, HCoV-NL 63, and HKU 1, which usually cause mild upper respiratory tract infections and occasionally pneumonia in older adults, neonates, and immunocompromised patients (5 – 8), SARS-CoV causes severe febrile lower respiratory tract illness that leads t...|$|R

40|$|The felids are {{the only}} {{definitive}} hosts of Toxoplasma gondii, which could excrete oocysts into the environment and provide an infection source for toxoplasmosis in various warm-blooded animal species, particularly the captive felids that live close to human communities. The infection rate of the captive felids is a perfect standard in detecting the presence of Toxoplasma gondii oocysts in the environment. In this study, sera or tissue samples from zoo (1 young tiger, 2 adult tigers, 6 young lions), farm (10 <b>masked</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civets),</b> and pet hospital (28 cats) from Henan Province (China) were collected. The sera (n = 47) were tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against T. gondii by using modified agglutination test (MAT), whereas the hearts tissue (n = 40) were bioassayed in mice to isolate T. gondii strains. The genotype was distinguished by using PCR-RFLP of 10 loci (SAG 1, SAG 2, SAG 3, GRA 6, BTUB, L 358, c 22 - 8, PK 1, c 29 - 2, and Apico). The detection rate for the T. gondii antibody in captive felids was 21. 3 % (10 / 47). One viable T. gondii strain (TgCatCHn 4) was obtained from a cat heart tissue, and its genotype was ToxoDB# 9.
