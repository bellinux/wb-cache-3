5|$|Mir was {{constructed}} between 1986 and 1996 {{and was the}} world's first <b>modular</b> <b>space</b> station. It was the first consistently inhabited long-term research station in space, and previously held the record for longest continuous human presence in space, at eight days short of ten years. Mir's purpose {{was to provide a}} large and habitable scientific laboratory in space, and, through a number of collaborations, including Intercosmos and Shuttle-Mir, was made internationally accessible to cosmonauts and astronauts of many different countries. The station existed until March 23, 2001, at which point it was deliberately deorbited, and broke apart during atmospheric re-entry.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NASA planned {{to launch a}} <b>modular</b> <b>space</b> station called Freedom as a {{counterpart}} to Mir, while the Soviets were planning to construct Mir-2 in the 1990s {{as a replacement for}} the station. Because of budget and design constraints, Freedom never progressed past mock-ups and minor component tests and, with the fall of the Soviet Union {{and the end of the}} Space Race, the project was nearly cancelled entirely by the United States House of Representatives. The post-Soviet economic chaos in Russia also led to the cancellation of Mir-2, though only after its base block, DOS-8, had been constructed. Similar budgetary difficulties were faced by other nations with space station projects, which prompted the US government to negotiate with European states, Russia, Japan, and Canada in the early 1990s to begin a collaborative project. In June 1992, American president George H. W. Bush and Russian president Boris Yeltsin agreed to cooperate on space exploration. The resulting Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes called for a short joint space programme with one American astronaut deployed to the Russian space station Mir and two Russian cosmonauts deployed to a Space Shuttle.|$|E

40|$|Aimed toward {{researchers}} {{and graduate students}} familiar with elements of functional analysis, linear algebra, and general topology; this book contains a general study of <b>modulars,</b> <b>modular</b> <b>spaces,</b> and metric <b>modular</b> <b>spaces.</b> <b>Modulars</b> may {{be thought of as}} generalized velocity fields and serve two important purposes: generate metric spaces in a unified manner and provide a weaker convergence, the modular convergence, whose topology is non-metrizable in general. Metric <b>modular</b> <b>spaces</b> are extensions of metric spaces, metric linear <b>spaces,</b> and classical <b>modular</b> linear <b>spaces.</b> The topics covered include the classification of modulars, metrizability of <b>modular</b> <b>spaces,</b> <b>modular</b> transforms and duality between <b>modular</b> <b>spaces,</b> metric  and <b>modular</b> topologies. Applications illustrated in this book include: the description of superposition operators acting in <b>modular</b> <b>spaces,</b> the existence of regular selections of set-valued mappings, new interpretations of spaces of Lipschitzian and absolutely continuous mappings, the existence of solutions to ordinary differential equations in Banach spaces with rapidly varying right-hand sides. ...|$|R

500|$|Mir ( [...] , lit.peace or world) was a {{space station}} that {{operated}} in low Earth orbit from 1986 to 2001, operated by the Soviet Union and later by Russia. Mir was the first <b>modular</b> <b>space</b> station and was assembled in orbit from 1986to1996. It had a greater mass than any previous spacecraft. At {{the time it was}} the largest artificial satellite in orbit, succeeded by the International Space Station after Mir's orbit decayed. The station served as a microgravity research laboratory in which crews conducted experiments in biology, human biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology and spacecraft systems with a goal of developing technologies required for permanent occupation of space.|$|E
500|$|Mir was {{the seventh}} and last manned space station to be {{launched}} {{as part of the}} Soviet space programme, and was the first true <b>modular</b> <b>space</b> station to be launched. The first component, the Core Module, was launched by a Proton-K rocket on 19 February 1986. This had been followed by six more modules, launched between 1987 and 1996, all using Proton-K rockets, except one which was launched aboard [...] Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Mir became the property of the Russian government, and the newly established Russian Aviation and Space Agency. It supported 28 long duration crews, visited by 40 manned Soyuz and Shuttle missions, whilst 64 unmanned Progress spacecraft were launched to support it. It was visited by 125 cosmonauts and astronauts, who performed 75 spacewalks.|$|E
