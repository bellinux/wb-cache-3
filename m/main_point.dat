5|$|According to a 2005 {{profile in}} the book Madcap by biographer and {{journalist}} Tim Willis, Barrett, who had reverted to using his original name of Roger, continued to live in his late mother's semi-detached home in Cambridge, and had returned to painting, creating large abstract canvases. He was also {{said to have been}} an avid gardener and his <b>main</b> <b>point</b> of {{contact with the outside world}} was his sister, Rosemary, who lived nearby. He was reclusive, and his physical health declined, as he suffered from stomach ulcers and type 2 diabetes.|$|E
5|$|The Port of New York and New Jersey {{comprised}} the <b>main</b> <b>point</b> of embarkation for U.S. troops and supplies sent to Europe during World War I, via the New York Port of Embarkation. The congestion {{at the port}} led experts to realize {{the need for a}} port authority to supervise the extremely complex system of bridges, highways, subways, and port facilities in the New York-New Jersey area. The solution was the 1921 creation of the Port Authority {{under the supervision of the}} governors of the two states. By issuing its own bonds, it was financially independent of either state; the bonds were paid off from tolls and fees, not from taxes. It became one of the major agencies of the metropolitan area for large-scale projects.|$|E
5|$|After Juan Ponce de León {{began the}} {{colonization}} process of Puerto Rico, the archipelago became a strategic military location, used by Spain {{to protect its}} colonies and possessions in America. Vessels {{used it as a}} <b>main</b> <b>point</b> for resupplying before attempting long voyages and trading became a key part of economy. However, when the mines and rivers in the main island of Puerto Rico, then known as San Juan Bautista, were depleted Puerto Rico began suffering from shortage of gold and its income was reduced drastically, precipitating a recession. Beginning in the 16th century, the Spanish Crown was forced to issue a monetary support decree to the archipelago known as situado, which was supplied by the Royal banks in Central America, particularly Mexico. However, this aid failed to arrive often, contributing to the economical instability. This was exacerbated by other factors, including the costs of running an efficient military and a lack of commercial prosperity. Natural conditions and disasters also contributed, multiplying the costs of maintaining fortresses while hurricanes damaged haciendas, destroying crops and shortening the amount of laborers.|$|E
40|$|In {{a passage}} {{containing}} <b>main</b> <b>points</b> and illustrative details, do the details facilitate the memorization of the <b>main</b> <b>points?</b> Previous studies {{on this question}} suggest that the answer depends {{on the nature of}} the passage: For short simple stories, <b>main</b> <b>points</b> were remembered better as more details were added; for longer, more difficult, factual passages, instead, <b>main</b> <b>points</b> were better conveyed by summaries in which the details had been removed. The aim of the experiment reported here is to find out whether this difference is due to the fact/fiction variable. Six simple two‐paragraph passages were used, each passage existing in three versions (short, medium, long) in which the <b>main</b> <b>points</b> were illustrated by varying numbers of details. The results showed that for fictional and factual passages of this kind, the addition of details improves recall of <b>main</b> <b>points.</b> Some possible explanations of this finding, and of the earlier contrary finding, are suggested...|$|R

5|$|In 2006 Wałęsa quit Solidarity {{in protest}} of the union's support of the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party, and Lech and Jarosław Kaczyński—twin {{brothers}} who had been prominent in Solidarity and were now serving as the country’s president and prime minister, respectively. The <b>main</b> <b>point</b> of disagreement was the Kaczyńskis’ focus on rooting out {{those who had been}} involved in communist rule and their party's attempt to make public all the files of the former communist secret police. Until then only members of the government and parliament had to declare any connection with the former security services. Wałęsa and his supporters argued the so-called transparency legislation advocated by the government might turn into a witch hunt and the more than 500,000 Poles who had possibly collaborated with the communist secret police could face exposure.|$|E
5|$|Once {{inside the}} skin, dengue virus binds to Langerhans cells (a {{population}} of dendritic {{cells in the}} skin that identifies pathogens). The virus enters the cells through binding between viral proteins and membrane proteins on the Langerhans cell, specifically the C-type lectins called DC-SIGN, mannose receptor and CLEC5A. DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, {{seems to be the}} <b>main</b> <b>point</b> of entry. The dendritic cell moves to the nearest lymph node. Meanwhile, the virus genome is translated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's endoplasmic reticulum, where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral RNA and begin to form viral particles. Immature virus particles are transported to the Golgi apparatus, the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains (glycoproteins). The now mature new viruses are released by exocytosis. They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as monocytes and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the <b>main</b> <b>point</b> of attention.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{founding}} of Tawau, the region around it {{was the subject of}} dispute between the British and Dutch spheres of influence. In 1893, the first British merchant vessel sailed into Tawau, marking the opening of the town's sea port. In 1898, the British set up a settlement in Tawau. The British North Borneo Chartered Company (BNBC) accelerated growth of the settlement's population by encouraging the immigration of Chinese. Consequent to the Japanese occupation of North Borneo, the Allied forces bombed the town, in mid-1944, razing it to the ground. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, 2,900 Japanese soldiers in Tawau became prisoners of war and were transferred to Jesselton. Tawau was rebuilt after the war, {{and by the end of}} 1947, the economy was restored to its pre-war status. Tawau was also the <b>main</b> <b>point</b> of conflict during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation from 1963 to 1966. During that period, it was garrisoned by the British Special Boat Section, and guarded by Australian Destroyers and combat aircraft. In December 1963, Tawau was bombed twice by Indonesia and shootings occurred across the Tawau-Sebatik Island international border. Indonesians were found trying to poison the town's water supply. In January 1965, a curfew was imposed to prevent Indonesian attackers from making contact with Indonesians living in the town. While in June 1965, another attempted invasion by the Indonesian forces was repelled by bombardment by an Australian destroyer. Military conflict finally ended in December 1966.|$|E

25|$|Qumran–Sectarian {{theories}} are {{variations on the}} Qumran–Essene theory. The <b>main</b> <b>point</b> of departure from the Qumran–Essene theory is hesitation to link the Dead Sea Scrolls specifically with the Essenes.

25|$|Because {{school feeding}} {{programs}} are community-specific and require {{a great deal}} of planning, the sustainability of school feeding programs is a <b>main</b> <b>point</b> of concern for many countries.

25|$|Early, pre-sectarian Buddhism had a {{somewhat}} vague {{position on the}} existence and effect of deities.

Of the major schools, Theravada tends to de-emphasize the gods, whereas Mahayana and Vajrayana do not.|$|E
