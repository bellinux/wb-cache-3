500|$|Prevention of {{high-frequency}} bearing current damage uses three approaches: good cabling and grounding practices, {{interruption of}} bearing currents, and filtering or damping of common-mode currents for example through soft magnetic cores, the so-called inductive absorbers.

[...] Bearing currents can be interrupted by installation of insulated bearings and specially designed electrostatic-shielded induction motors. [...] Filtering and damping high-frequency bearing can be done though inserting soft magnetic cores over the three phases giving a high frequency impedance against the common mode or <b>motor</b> <b>bearing</b> currents.

500|$|The carrier-frequency pulsed {{output voltage}} of a PWM VFD causes rapid rise times in these pulses, the {{transmission}} line effects of which must be considered. Since the transmission-line impedance of the cable and motor are different, pulses tend to reflect back from the motor terminals into the cable. The resulting voltages can produce overvoltages equal to twice the DC bus voltage or up to 3.1times the rated line voltage for long cable runs, putting high stress on the cable and motor windings, and eventual insulation failure. [...] Insulation [...] standards for three-phase motors rated 230V or less adequately protect against such long-lead overvoltages. [...] On 460V or 575V systems and inverters with 3rd-generation 0.1-microsecond-rise-time IGBTs, the maximum recommended cable distance between VFD and motor is about 50m or 150feet. Solutions to overvoltages caused by long lead lengths include minimizing cable distance, lowering carrier frequency, installing dV/dt filters, using inverter-duty-rated motors (that are rated 600V to withstand pulse trains with rise time {{less than or equal}} to 0.1microsecond, of 1,600V peak magnitude), and installing LCR low-pass sine wave filters. Regarding lowering of carrier frequency, note that audible noise is noticeably increased for carrier frequencies less than about 6kHz and is most noticeable at about 3kHz. Selection of optimum PWM carrier frequency for ACdrives involves balancing noise, heat, motor insulation stress, common-mode voltage-induced <b>motor</b> <b>bearing</b> current damage, smooth motor operation, and other factors. Further harmonics attenuation can be obtained by using an LCR low-pass sine wave filter or dV/dtfilter.|$|E

5000|$|The three-point [...] "suspended sub-chassis" [...] was {{a design}} by renowned audio pioneer Edgar Villchur. It {{became the basis}} upon which his company created the Acoustic Research XA {{turntable}} that was launched in 1961. The principle behind {{it is that the}} turntable is an inert platform that allows the stylus to track the surface of the record accurately whilst being protected from external vibrations. The platter, sub-chassis, armboard and tonearm mechanically form a closed loop, and sit on top of dampers (usually three springs) which isolate the sub-assembly from its motor and its base. The motor, mounted (directly or indirectly) on the top plate, drives the turntable platter via a belt. The compression spring system of the XA was much improved upon, and popularised in the Linn Sondek LP12.
