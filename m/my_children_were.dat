25|$|When {{producers}} at All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> <b>were</b> {{looking for}} a new villainess to wreak havoc in fictional town Pine Valley, they created character Greenlee Smythe. Executives at ABC were already considering actress Rebecca Budig for the role. Budig, who felt that becoming the character was a great opportunity to expand her range as an actress, sent the show her video reel.|$|E
25|$|At the time, {{soap operas}} {{featured}} mostly older casts. To add a contemporary feel to the show, Nixon focused on younger characters, while also mixing in older ones {{so as not}} to lose traditional viewers. The youths on All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> <b>were</b> Tara Martin (Karen Lynn Gorney), Phillip Brent (Richard Hatch), Chuck Tyler (Jack Stauffer), and Erica Kane (Susan Lucci). For those parts, the show wanted to cast unknown actors.|$|E

This studio was made available by the move of sister serial All My Children to a production facility in Los Angeles, where that series began taping on January 4, 2010. The new studio was 30% larger than One Life to Live previous one, and both One Life to Live and All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> <b>were</b> to be taped and broadcast in high-definition (HD) after their moves.|$|E

500|$|One of my very {{greatest}} fears as a {{child was}} being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. People {{come up to you}} in the street and shake your hand and talk to you in a respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into [...] "Icke's a nutter." [...] I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. It was a nightmare. <b>My</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> devastated because their dad was a figure of ridicule.|$|E
2500|$|.....in Buddhism {{the image}} of the mother as the {{embodiment}} of compassion is used a lot. She'll do anything for the children. As a mother I felt that depth of love and commitment and having somebody who I really would give my own life for—it was very powerful {{to have that kind of}} relationship. I also felt that I didn't really grow up until I had my children. There were ways that maturity was demanded of me and having children brought forth that maturity. So I wouldn't say <b>my</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> an inspiration in the sense of what I thought would have been a spiritual inspiration before I had children. More so I think meeting the challenges of motherhood with what I had learned made my practice very rich.|$|E
2500|$|At her trial {{prosecutors}} {{alleged that}} Sandiford met Dougall and Beales {{at a hotel}} in Bangkok on 17 May 2012, where arrangements were made for her to courier the cocaine into Bali. She arrived on the island two days later. In her defence, Sandiford claimed that she had been pressured into carrying the drugs by a gang who had made threats against her children, while her lawyers argued she was suffering from mental health problems. In a statement to the court she expressed regret over her involvement, [...] "I would like to begin by apologising to the Republic of Indonesia and the Indonesian people for my involvement. I would never have become involved in something like this but the lives of <b>my</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> in danger and I felt I had to protect them." [...] Her son gave a statement to the court in which he said he believed she was forced to carry the drugs following a disagreement over rent money she had paid on his behalf. A report by Dr. Jennifer Fleetwood, a lecturer in criminology at the University of Kent and expert on women in the international drugs trade was also presented to the court, suggesting Sandiford was an ideal target for drug traffickers. [...] "There is … evidence to suggest that a trafficker would seek someone who was vulnerable. Having reviewed extracts from Lindsay's medical records I know that Lindsay has a history of mental health issues … This may have unfortunately made her an attractive target for threats, manipulation and coercion." ...|$|E
