5|$|Fight Club was {{released}} in the Blu-ray Disc format in the United States on November17, 2009. Fox Creative chose Neuron Syndicate to design the art for the format's packaging, and Neuron commissioned five graffiti artists to create 30 pieces of art. The art encompasses urban aesthetics found on the East Coast and West Coast of the United States as well as influences from European street art. The Blu-ray edition opens with a <b>menu</b> <b>screen</b> for the romantic comedy Never Been Kissed starring Drew Barrymore before leading into the actual Fight Club <b>menu</b> <b>screen.</b> David Fincher got permission from Barrymore to include the fake <b>menu</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} Final Fantasy installments, Final Fantasy VI {{consists of}} four basic modes of gameplay: an overworld map, town and dungeon field maps, a battle screen, and a <b>menu</b> <b>screen.</b> The overworld map is a scaled-down version of the game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. As with most games in the series, the three primary means of travel across the overworld are by foot, chocobo, and airship. With a few plot-driven exceptions, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld when traveling by foot. The <b>menu</b> <b>screen</b> is where the player makes such decisions as which characters {{will be in the}} traveling party, which equipment they wield, the magic they learn, and the configuration of the gameplay. It is also used to track experience points and levels.|$|E
5|$|Golden Sun also {{features}} an optional battling mode accessible from the <b>menu</b> <b>screen.</b> In this mode, players can enter {{a team from}} their saved game files into an arena environment where they battle increasingly difficult CPU-controlled enemies. Additionally, players can select three of their four characters to fight another player's three-character team. The player does not receive any reward or punishment for participating in these battles.|$|E
5000|$|Windows XP Embedded, <b>menus,</b> <b>screens</b> {{and full}} GIS {{electronic}} maps.|$|R
50|$|Rogue Leader also {{features}} short clips {{from the movie}} trilogy, during the <b>menu</b> <b>screens</b> and cut-scenes.|$|R
50|$|The game {{included}} the songs, Sunstroke, The Drive Home and a remix of Nagasaki Badger by Chicane which are {{played on the}} main <b>menu</b> <b>screens.</b>|$|R
5|$|When not in battle, {{the player}} {{can use the}} <b>menu</b> <b>screen.</b> On this screen, the player can review each character's status and statistics, use items and abilities, change equipment, save the game (when on the world map or at a save point), and manage orbs called Materia. The main method of {{customizing}} characters in Final Fantasy VII, Materia may be added to equipment to provide characters with new magic spells, commands, statistical upgrades, and other benefits. Materia level {{up with their own}} experience point system, and can be combined to create different effects.|$|E
5|$|While Criterion {{had their}} own audio team to create {{original}} music, working with EA gave {{them the opportunity to}} include licensed music in Burnout 3. EA launched an initiative called EA TRAX in 2002 with the intent of including licensed tracks in all their games. Burnout 3s soundtrack featured over forty songs, delivered in a radio station format presented by DJ Stryker from alternative rock station KROQ-FM. Options were added to modify which songs during a race or on the <b>menu</b> <b>screen</b> and the Xbox version supports custom soundtracks.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy {{has four}} basic game modes: an overworld map, town and dungeon maps, a battle screen, and a <b>menu</b> <b>screen.</b> The overworld map is a {{scaled-down}} {{version of the}} game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. The primary means of travel across the overworld is by foot; a canoe, a ship, and an airship become available as the player progresses. With the exception of some battles in preset locations or with bosses, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld map when traveling by foot, canoe, or ship, and must either be fought or fled from.|$|E
50|$|Lobbies are <b>menu</b> <b>screens</b> where {{players can}} inspect the {{upcoming}} game session, examine {{the results of}} the last, change their settings, and talk to each other.|$|R
50|$|The player makes choices from <b>menu</b> <b>screens</b> {{regarding}} {{aspects of}} the car such as the tires, depth of tire tread and angle of the rear wing, and is then shown highlights of the race.|$|R
50|$|The CD-I version {{features}} enhanced graphics, a new interface (wordless <b>menu</b> <b>screens)</b> and {{an introduction}} cinematic was planned {{to give the}} game a story (however this was abandoned due to time constraints). This version was only released in Europe and was titled Pac-Panic.|$|R
5|$|Gameplay in {{relation}} to The Lost Age's battle mode is similar to traditional role-playing video games. In each battle, the player is required to defeat all the enemies using direct attacks with weapons, offensive Psynergy spells, and other means of causing damage, all while keeping their own party alive through items and supportive Psynergy that restore life and supplement defense. If all the player's characters are downed by reducing their hit points to zero, the party is returned to the last village that the player visited and suffers a monetary penalty. The successful completion of a battle yields experience points, coins, and occasionally rare items. In addition to the main game itself, {{there is also a}} competitive battling mode accessible from the <b>menu</b> <b>screen,</b> where players can enter their teams into an arena to battle increasingly difficult CPU-controlled enemies or other players head-to-head.|$|E
5|$|The game's plot {{develops}} as {{the player}} progresses through towns and dungeons. Some town citizens offer helpful information, while others own shops that sell items or equipment. Dungeons appear {{in areas that}} include forests, caves, mountains, swamps, underwater caverns, and buildings. Dungeons often have treasure chests containing rare items that are not available in most stores. The game's <b>menu</b> <b>screen</b> allows the player {{to keep track of}} their experience points and levels, to choose which equipment their characters wield, and to use items and magic. A character's most basic attribute is their level, which can range from one to fifty, and is determined by the character's amount of experience. Gaining a level increases the character's attributes, such as their maximum hit points (HP), which represents a character's remaining health; a character dies when they reach zero HP. Characters gain experience points by winning battles.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack for {{the game}} is an {{original}} score composed by Alex Guilbert. The theme for Saw, a series of plunking piano keys joined by a bass drum and violins, can be heard during the <b>menu</b> <b>screen</b> and the end credits. At some points during the game, a quick tempo score similar to the opening piano track is used to increase suspense during trap and puzzle sequences. A high-pitched tune can be heard during slower parts of the game, which was used to make these parts more ominous. Variations or mixes of these tracks occur throughout the game. The game utilizes a minimalist approach to music, {{with most of the}} ambient sound being provided by other victims, screaming or taunting protagonist David Tapp. Because the tracks were meant for a video game, there are no vocals; the tracks are much shorter than typical songs and are more abundant.|$|E
5000|$|The game's tagline was [...] "Kill your enemies. Kill your friends' enemies. Kill your friends." [...] This tagline has reappeared as a {{description}} in the multiplayer <b>menu</b> <b>screens</b> {{for some of}} Bungie's other games, such as Myth: The Fallen Lords and Halo 3.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{shortcomings}} {{in the game}} is the simple AI; the average player can bowl the computer out for totals not exceeding 20. Some of the other poor features in the game are the unrealistically green grass and the uninspired music found in the <b>menu</b> <b>screens.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The game {{is capable}} of 7.1 channel {{surround}} sound in PCM (Dolby Digital and DTS are also available). As well as optionally using songs from the player's hard drive, several categories of licensed music are available for the game's racing, <b>menu</b> <b>screens,</b> and the photo mode. These include: ...|$|R
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} in which the player takes control of a silent protagonist that can be named and whose personality is determined by dialogue choices made in the game. Navigation is split into two types: standard navigation through the game's three-dimensional (3D) dungeons in a first-person view, and navigation around the protagonist's home of Hirasaki City using a 3D overworld map. During dungeon navigation, the player's route is automatically mapped, and the map can be viewed in the <b>menu</b> <b>screen.</b> Non-playable characters (NPCs) are represented in first-person navigation with 2D sprites, and their speech is represented with head-and-shoulder portraits above dialogue boxes. Quests are available at a location called the House of Divination, which the player can choose to accept in exchange for rewards. Various stores are scattered throughout Hirasaki City for buying items, weapons and armor, and healing the player's party and reserves. A key currency in the game is Magnetite, which is used for summoning demons and as currency {{in some of the}} stores.|$|E
25|$|With {{the launch}} of the WWE Network in 2014, Benoit's matches were {{presented}} uncut, with no edits to any footage or commentary as had been the case on previous WWE releases. However, a disclaimer precedes any program which features his matches. Additionally, some pay-per-view posters which featured Benoit have been replaced with new artwork on the Network's <b>menu</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Users could access their {{wardrobe}} {{from the}} <b>Menu</b> <b>Screen</b> {{at any time}} and location, except when in another user's personal apartment. The wardrobe contained two sections: one was the main wardrobe for frequently used items (capacity of 500), and the other was a storage section for less frequently used items. New items were marked accordingly. Users could also filter the wardrobe view to only display favourite, purchased, rewards, or recently acquired items.|$|E
50|$|The Wii {{version of}} Armageddon {{has a new}} motion-based control system, along with {{compatibility}} with the classic and GameCube controllers. It has a new Endurance Mode, a Wii Remote Training Mode, new <b>menu</b> <b>screens,</b> and Khameleon as a playable character. However, this version does not have online features.|$|R
5000|$|AllGame {{criticized the}} game for its few sound effects and [...] "generic {{background}} music", {{as well as the}} need to [...] "constantly switch back and forth" [...] between different <b>menu</b> <b>screens,</b> [...] "making it easy to forget what you're doing in relation to what needs to be done." ...|$|R

25|$|Version 1.65, {{released}} on April 25, 2012, replaced the Menu Pad {{with a new}} simplified <b>Menu</b> <b>Screen,</b> added adjustments to the furniture slot memory, enhanced visual display of available memory use, and added a new Voice Chat system that replaced the personal call function. Alerts were also made to integrate better, {{and the ability to}} shop from the Wardrobe was added. The cross-game invite system was expanded, and the stability of real time games was improved.|$|E
25|$|In various episodes Weebl {{states that}} he cannot move, unlike Bob who rolls or hops to get to places. He can only be seen rolling in the Wobbl and Bob DVD, during the cutscenes when a {{category}} is selected in the <b>menu</b> <b>screen.</b> Otherwise, it remains a mystery of how he moves, although Bob uses methods of transport to carry him around in several episodes, it says that Weebl invented sheep especially on the episode 'gravy'.|$|E
25|$|Accessed {{with the}} Wii Remote's HOME button, the HOME Menu {{displays}} {{information about the}} controller(s) currently being used, and allows the user to configure certain options. At {{the bottom of the}} <b>menu</b> <b>screen,</b> the battery life of all connected controllers is displayed. Below that is a bar labeled Wii Remote Settings. Selecting it brings users to an options screen where they can control the audio output volume, rumble settings, and reconnect the controllers, for example to connect Wii Remotes through one-time synchronization. Depending on when the HOME Menu is accessed, there will be a different amount of buttons displayed.|$|E

5000|$|A new [...] "Madden NFL 13 Theme", {{composed}} by Colin O'Malley, {{to be played}} {{at the beginning of}} the game as well as variations heard at quarter breaks, halftime, and postgame. In addition, an approx. 15-16 track, fully orchestrated soundtrack, also {{composed by}} O'Malley, will replace EA Trax for the music on the <b>menu</b> <b>screens</b> and other game modes.|$|R
500|$|The ZX Spectrum +2 was Amstrad's first Spectrum, coming {{shortly after}} their {{purchase}} of the Spectrum range and [...] "Sinclair" [...] brand in 1986. The machine featured an all-new grey case featuring a spring-loaded keyboard, dual joystick ports, and a built-in cassette recorder dubbed the [...] "Datacorder" [...] (like the Amstrad CPC 464), but was in most respects identical to the ZX Spectrum 128. The main <b>menu</b> <b>screen</b> lacked the Spectrum 128's [...] "Tape Test" [...] option, and the ROM was altered to account for a new 1986 Amstrad copyright message. These changes resulted in minor incompatibility problems with software that accessed ROM routines at certain addresses. Production costs had been reduced and the retail price dropped to £139–£149.|$|E
500|$|While Jason {{is inside}} SOPHIA in the 2D {{platforming}} mode, the player can attack the mutants {{with the main}} cannon (which can shoot up, left, and right determined by {{the orientation of the}} tank) or with one of three special weapons. Special weapons have limited ammunition which must be collected from exploring the game. They include the following: homing missiles that, when fired, shoot 1 missile at each enemy on screen up to 4; [...] "Thunder Break", which fires a high-damage lightning bolt downward; and [...] "Multi Warhead Missiles", which simultaneously fires a set of three missiles at enemies in front of and diagonally up and down. Players select their special weapon and monitor the amounts of each special weapon left by accessing the <b>Menu</b> <b>Screen</b> by pressing the Start button.|$|E
500|$|Combat in Kingdom Hearts II is in {{real-time}} {{and involves}} heavy hack and slash elements with button presses which initiate attacks by the on-screen character. A role-playing game menu on the screen's bottom left, {{similar to those found}} in Final Fantasy games, provides other combat options such as using magic or items, summoning beings to assist in battle, or executing combination attacks with other party members. A new feature is the [...] "Reaction Command", special enemy-specific attacks that are triggered when the player presses the triangle button at the correct time during battle. Reaction Commands can be used to defeat regular enemies or avoid damage, and are sometimes necessary to complete a boss battle. In addition to the main character, two party members are usually present who also participate in combat. Although these characters are computer-controlled, the player is allowed to customize their behavior to a certain extent through the <b>menu</b> <b>screen,</b> such as attacking the same enemy Sora targets.|$|E
50|$|The Game Boy Advance {{version has}} the most games out of the {{portable}} versions, including seven homebrew games that do not appear {{in any of the}} other versions. It does not include the 19 Imagic games or Commando, nor does it play music during gameplay. It does have four custom 1980s-style music tracks that play in the <b>menu</b> <b>screens,</b> however.|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} new wave patterns, backgrounds, music tracks and bosses in SIE2 {{as well as}} a {{commentator}} which you hear when the player achieves certain goals. This male voice also serves to provides words of encouragement and congratulations. However, as in a possible throwback to the last game, the first stage background pattern from Extreme 1 is visible in the background in the <b>menu</b> <b>screens.</b>|$|R
