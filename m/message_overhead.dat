Current distributed approaches for resolving complex search queries, like multi-attribute and range queries, typically require multiple messages to resolve a single search request. This generates significant <b>messaging</b> <b>overhead</b> and increases the response latency. To reduce the <b>messaging</b> <b>overhead</b> and the search latency, some approaches like the Multi-Attribute Addressable Network (MAAN) use static replication. However, this results in high main memory requirements and large data transfers each time a device joins the P 2 P network. Those drawbacks can be tolerated for P 2 P networks that mainly consist of fixed, powerful nodes like PCs but are intolerable for resource-constrained nodes with high churn, like mobile devices. As mobile devices will {{play a significant role}} in accessing and distributing data in the future, we present an improved search mechanism for distributed resolution of complex queries on resourceconstrained devices.

40|$|Abstract—We re-examine {{the problem}} of load {{balancing}} in conservatively synchronized parallel, discrete-event simulations executed on high-performance computing clusters, focusing on simulations where computational and messaging load tend to be spatially clustered. Such domains are frequently characterized {{by the presence of}} geographic “hot-spots ” – regions that generate significantly more simulation events than others. Examples of such domains include simulation of urban regions, transportation networks and networks where interaction between entities is often constrained by physical proximity. Noting that in conservatively synchronized parallel simulations, the speed of execution of the simulation is determined by the slowest (i. e most heavily loaded) simulation process, we study different partitioning strategies in achieving equitable processor-load distribution in domains with spatially clustered load. In particular, we study the effectiveness of partitioning via spatial scattering to achieve optimal load balance. In this partitioning technique, nearby entities are explicitly assigned to different processors, thereby scattering the load across the cluster. This is motivated by two observations, namely, (i) since load is spatially clustered, spatial scattering should, intuitively, spread the load across the compute cluster, and (ii) in parallel simulations, equitable distribution of CPU load is a greater determinant of execution speed than <b>message</b> passing <b>overhead.</b> Through large-scale simulation experiments – both of abstracted and real simulation models – we observe that scatter partitioning, even with its greatly increased <b>messaging</b> <b>overhead,</b> significantly outperforms more conventional spatial partitioning techniques that seek to reduce <b>messaging</b> <b>overhead.</b> Further, even if hot-spots change {{over the course of the}} simulation, if the underlying feature of spatial clustering is retained, load continues to be balanced with spatial scattering leading us to the observation that spatial scattering can often obviate the need for dynamic load balancing.

This paper proposes a QoS-routing algorithm with bounded flooding which not only dramatically reduces <b>message</b> <b>overhead</b> and operational cost, but also performs well in finding a `qualified' route. This significant overhead reduction is achieved by limiting the search area within which connection-establishment request messages are flooded. Since our scheme is based on limited request-flooding, it requires neither on-demand path calculation nor link-state dissemination, both of which are known to be very expensive. In order to limit the search area, we employ a distance table at each node storing hop counts of the shortest paths to all the nodes reachable via its outgoing links. Unlike link-state routing, the proposed scheme only needs networkconnectivity information that changes much less frequently than link-load states. Extensive simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of performance, operational cost, and <b>message</b> <b>overhead.</b> Especially, under an ordinary operating condition in which the network's physical topology doesn't change frequently, it is shown to be much better than all the other existing QoS-routing schemes in terms of <b>message</b> <b>overhead</b> and operational cost, while providing reasonably good performance...|$|E
