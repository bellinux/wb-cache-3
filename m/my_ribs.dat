I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E

Reports came out of the Giants training compound of the exploits of the new [...] Taylor's teammates took to calling him Superman and joked that his locker should be replaced with a phone booth. Phil Simms, the team's quarterback, said, [...] "on the pass rush, he's an animal. He's either going to run around you or over you. With his quickness, he's full speed after two steps." [...] Taylor made his NFL exhibition debut on August 8, 1981, recording 2 sacks in the Giants' 23–7 win over the Chicago Bears. Before the season word spread around the league about Taylor. Years after facing him in an exhibition game, Pittsburgh Steelers Quarterback Terry Bradshaw recalled, [...] "e dang-near killed me, I just kept saying, 'Who is this guy?'

6000|$|If a man {{frequently}} passes unjust judgments, {{takes up}} false attitudes, intermits his acts of kindness with rude behaviour or cruel words, and {{falls into the}} consequent vulgar error of supposing that he can make amends by laboured agreeableness, I cannot consider such courses any the less ugly because they are ascribed to [...] "temper." [...] Especially I object to the assumption that his having a fundamentally good disposition is either an apology or a compensation for his bad behaviour. If his temper yesterday made him lash the horses, upset the curricle and cause a breakage in <b>my</b> <b>rib,</b> I feel it no compensation that to-day he vows he will drive me anywhere in the gentlest manner any day {{as long as he}} lives. Yesterday was what it was, <b>my</b> <b>rib</b> is paining me, it is not a main object of my life to be driven by Touchwood--and I have no confidence in his lifelong gentleness. The utmost form of placability I am capable of is to try and remember his better deeds already performed, and, mindful of my own offences, to bear him no malice. But I cannot accept his amends.|$|R

5000|$|In the 2014 Winter X Games, McMorris placed 2nd behind fellow Canadian Max Parrot in the Slopestyle event. McMorris' {{hopes of}} a 3rd {{consecutive}} gold medal were dashed when he tripped on the rails, crashed, and fractured a rib during the 3rd and final run of the event. Despite the injury, McMorris still competed in the Winter Olympics in Sochi. As McMorris arrived in Sochi, {{he said he felt}} remarkably good, stating, [...] "The amount of progress I've made since I broke <b>my</b> <b>rib</b> on Saturday has been unexplainable.

5000|$|The album {{features}} several snippets {{from various}} points at Whitley's career, including: a performance {{that he gave}} at age eight on Buddy Starcher's television show in Charleston, West Virginia; a radio show performance given {{as a member of}} the Lonesome Mountain Boys in 1971; two interviews from the radio countdown show American Country Countdown (then hosted by Bob Kingsley); and an interview with Ralph Emery. Also included are [...] "Lucky Dog" [...] and [...] "Would These Arms Be in Your Way," [...] both of which were included on only the compact disc release of his 1988 album Don't Close Your Eyes, as well as [...] "I Never Go Around Mirrors" [...] from that album and [...] "Between an Old Memory and Me" [...] from 1989's I Wonder Do You Think of Me. These latter two songs were added because they were among Whitley's favorite songs that he recorded. Three of the new songs — [...] "Backbone Job," [...] "I Want <b>My</b> <b>Rib</b> Back" [...] and the title track — had already been recorded by Whitley as demos, with new musical accompaniment added by producer Garth Fundis. The rest of the songs on the album were to have been included on an album that was never released. Kenny Chesney later recorded [...] "I Want <b>My</b> <b>Rib</b> Back" [...] on his 1994 debut album In My Wildest Dreams, [...] "Brotherly Love" [...] was originally a single for Moe Bandy in 1989, and Wade Hayes covered the title track on his 1995 debut album Old Enough to Know Better.

Online Sutta revealed that she broke a rib while on tour with the group and the group's management failed to provide her with any accommodation, so the [...] "almost homeless" [...] singer had to crash on a friend's couch as she recovered from a broken rib. In Life & Style magazine she stated: [...] "I basically felt like nothing more than a glorified back-up dancer after seven years with the group. I wasn't feeling like I was growing in the situation.

He did not want for abilities; had the best temper in the world; was well bred and gentlemanlike always; and was gay even after Moscow. His courage was known, and his {{character}} for bravery and another kind of gallantry probably exaggerated by his bad reputation. Had his mother not been alive, perhaps he would have believed in the virtue of no woman. But this one he worshipped, and spoke with tenderness and enthusiasm of her constant love and patience and goodness. [...] "See her miniature!" [...] he said, [...] "I never separate myself from it--oh, never! It saved my life in an affair about--about a woman who was not worth the powder which poor Jules and I burned for her. His ball struck me here, upon the waistcoat, bruising <b>my</b> <b>rib</b> and sending me to my bed, which I never should have left alive but for this picture. Oh, she is an angel, my mother!

5000|$|Although {{the song}} {{sounds like a}} typical romantic slow-dance song, it is about rationalizing extreme acts in {{reaction}} to his girlfriend dumping him for another man. He sings how he would rather endure the pain of various acts of masochism [...] "than spend one more minute with you". These include: ripping out his intestines with a fork, jumping onto a pile of thumbtacks naked, diving [...] "into a swimming pool filled with double-edged razor blades," [...] eating shards of broken glass, forcing an icepick underneath a toenail (or two), and slamming his fingers in a door repeatedly. In the closing verse, he states that he [...] "would rather rip my heart right out of <b>my</b> <b>rib</b> cage with <b>my</b> bare hands and then throw {{it on the floor}} and stomp on it 'til I die", painting a particularly dramatic image of his true feelings for his ex-love. The things he does in reaction to the split are suitably bizarre also: after mentioning he has torn up her photos and removed her number from his Rolodex (presumably acceptable things), he also recounts having burned down the malt shop the two had frequented {{for the sake of the}} bad memories. Other than preferring to perform violent acts than spending [...] "one more minute with you" [...] he also states he would rather do disgusting things like cleaning all the bathrooms in Grand Central Station with his tongue.|$|R
2500|$|By Saturday, the {{infection}} had died down, and she flew to Kona. On Sunday Wellington published a blog post {{in which she}} referred to Sun Tzu's book The Art of War and elaborated on how war strategy {{could be applied to}} triathlon, saying that she hadn't lost her fight because of her injuries and quoting Bella Bayliss's dictum that [...] "It's not a race, it's war." [...] The flight had caused her leg to swell up again, but she was still able to do some bike and run training. On Monday she tried a four-kilometre swim, her first hard swim since the crash; this produced pain in her pectoral muscle, which worsened over subsequent training sessions. On Tuesday she tried another swim session: after 1km she had to stop, and again had to be lifted out of the pool by Lowe. She later wote, [...] "I was 'crying into my goggles', and described the pain as 'unbearable'", adding, [...] "I was convinced I'd broken <b>my</b> <b>rib.</b> Every breath hurt and I couldn't move my arm properly." [...] The previous day Mike Leahy had begun treating Wellington using his Active Release Therapy (ART); he instructed her {{to go to the hospital}} for tests, not wanting to continue ART treatment if the problem was a fracture. The hospital's first concern, from the swollen state of her leg, was that she might have a pulmonary embolism. Six hours of tests showed that she had no fractures, nor any embolism, but that she did have damaged pectoral and intercostal muscles; the badly infected state of her leg was obvious from the appalling smell when the bandages were removed.|$|R
