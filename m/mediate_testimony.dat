I argue that e-testimony introduces complexities in justification and cognitive management generally {{which should be}} of special interest to epistemologists and cognitive scientists. In contrast to ordinary non-technology <b>mediated</b> <b>testimony,</b> e-testimony is an impoverished stimulus. Users have to assess the epistemic and non-epistemic risks of accessing e-testimony with very little supporting information. This raises the cognitive overhead of such judgments. The paper explores mechanisms for reducing this cognitive overhead and more effectively managing e-testimony, including automated filtering and automated censorship of the incoming e-testimony stream. It is argued that such solutions may not reduce cognitive load, since epistemic responsibility still resides with the individual recipient of e-testimony...|$|R

40|$|My paper {{draws on}} {{narrative}} theory and discourse analysis {{to explore the}} role and ethical positioning of translators (and ‘mediators’ in general) {{in relation to the}} texts they relay. Translators are not only mediators {{in the sense that they}} circulate a text in a wider community and address a new reading public. They are also literally ‘in the middle’, intermediaries negotiating between the text and the reader. In this capacity, they are sometimes – or maybe more often than we realize – confronted with texts expressing ideas and values they strongly disagree with but nevertheless transmit. My corpus consists of testimonies delivered by perpetrators of mass political violence and genocide (in Rwanda, and during the Second World War). The translation and circulation of these texts inevitably raise questions of ethical and social responsibility, and of accountability: indeed, why give the perpetrator a voice and an audience? Mediators are therefore often compelled to disclose their own moral position in relation to the text they transmit and counterbalance the perpetrator’s discourse. A discursive analysis will lay bare the polyphonic or “multivocal” (Hermans 2007) nature of the <b>mediated</b> <b>testimony.</b> It will moreover reveal that mediators resort to specific ‘framing’ strategies (Baker 2006), mobilizing rhetorical strategies to manipulate the text’s interpretation and possibly even undermine its key positions. This paper also aims to take part in the debate around translation and authorship. There has been much discussion around the position of translators and their responsibility for the translated text. Some scholars object that translators can speak with a voice of their own and deny them authorship in the ethical sense (cf. Pym 2011). I will refer to Goffman’s formal pragmatics, in particular to his ‘footing’ analysis, to point out that translators speak in fact with more than one voice (cf. Hermans 2007). Adopting the theatrical metaphor introduced by Goffman, I argue that translators stage themselves as mere ‘animators’ (expressing no personal opinion, cf. Venuti 1994) in the translated text. We can distinguish, then, the performed ‘figure’ from the ‘addressing self’, simulation from critical judgment. It is precisely the translator’s ‘split personality’, this marginal space between the translator and its figure, that creates the possibility for an ethics of translation. I believe this is a crucial and integral part of translation practice that allows us to understand its social, political and cultural meaning...|$|R
40|$|With {{the help}} of key {{normative}} concepts borrowed from social epistemology (Goldman 1999) and work on epistemic duties and norms of justification (Steup 2001, Adler 2002) we want to clarify what {{is at the core}} of learning <b>mediated</b> through <b>testimony.</b> In socially networked professional contexts, assessment of the epistemic reliability of networked information is important: justification of knowledge acquired via the word of others has an intrinsic social and normative dimension. Whereas the former has been largely taken into account in today’s (e-) learning theories based on social constructivism and connectivism, the normative dimension of justification is very much overlooked. The enormous wealth of information on the internet, the myriad of seemingly contradictory statements and the distance that powerful media create between the information spread and the direct access to the facts and first-hand experience, poses challenges to learning theorists who want to formulate solid foundations for e-learning. This has led many to adopt theories, like socio-constructivism and connectivism, which put less focus on truth, accuracy and truthfulness in an effort to cope with dissenting opinions. We will argue that shying away from truthfulness as a central ingredient of learning is mistaken. You can have the benefits from today’s e-learning theories without committing to the fallacies of relativism or constructivism. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper revisits Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" essay and {{traces the}} fate of the idea that {{contemporary}} media technologies have abolished the auratic component of "distance". Such technologies have long been understood as participating – for good or ill – in globalisation. But there is a tension in the Mechanical Reproduction essay since while it is often taken as celebrating the revolutionary possibilities of post-auratic mediation, it also anticipates the dialectical return – indeed, the "resurrection" – of the auratic within these same technologies. I will emphasise an obvious but overlooked fact of modern technology: it often fails. And I will argue that it is in technology’s failure that traces of aura, of cultic and religious elements reappear. It is a fact of the economy of digital technology that sound and visuals must be "compressed"; because of the constraints of bandwidth, data must be stripped to a bare minimum {{if it is to be}} stored or disseminated. Digital representations and mediations, therefore, are often of an extremely poor quality; they are distorted and obscure. What is more, when the most horrific of events are technologically mediated (i. e., CCTV footage of the last sighting of a missing child; the increasingly desperate efforts of air traffic control to reach a hijacked plane; digital photographs, taken on mobile phones, of the London underground bombings; video statements by masked suicide bombers) these terrifying testimonies are delivered by low fidelity, even failing technologies, and their representations are marked by the mute, asignifying patina of the functioning of the medium. So it is that communication technologies – the mobile and satellite phone, the video link – often do not work as intended (the channel breaks up, the message is distorted) and, as a result, one experiences the sudden reintroduction of distance, the veiling of the phenomenon and the horror of disconnection. Strategically, this collapse of communication plays into the ideology of global news reportage as it dramatises the struggle to connect with dangerous parts of the world. And, ironically, the "authenticity" of modern technologically <b>mediated</b> <b>testimony</b> (another important Benjaminian theme) is proportional to its interference, to the poverty of its representation. Noise escapes the logic of mechanical reproduction and mediation since it is not reproducible as such, but arises in and through the act of reproduction and mediation. Noise reintroduces distance, uniqueness and eventality to the reproduced. Noise, distortion, interference and failure mark the return of a technology to its state of nature. And as Benjamin points out in "Language as Such and the Language of Man," nature is mute, it has no language, and in its muteness, it laments. In the midst of communication, in suppressed and repressed noise, in its ghostly insubstantiality, is an asignifying lament...|$|R
40|$|This PhD {{draws on}} {{discourse}} analysis to explore different {{representations of the}} perpetrator’s figure in testimony and literature. The corpus consists of testimonies delivered by actors of mass political violence and genocide in Rwanda and during the Second World War, and novels embracing their point of view. Anneleen Spiessens proposes an analysis of three texts on the Holocaust, presenting various degrees of ‘fictionalization’: Rudolf Höss’s edited and translated autobiography; Robert Merle’s ‘fictional autobiography’ of Höss, La Mort est mon métier; and Jonathan Littell’s most controversial novel Les Bienveillantes. The Holocaust corpus will be set against literature on Rwanda, ranging from transcribed interviews (Une saison de machettes by Jean Hatzfeld) to a poetic novel (Le Passé devant soi by Gilbert Gatore) and more hybrid texts (Fest’Africa’s literary festival). The Holocaust and the 1994 Rwandan genocide will be connected both {{at the level of}} the events, and of literary memory (Michael Rothberg). The perpetrator’s story is a formally and ethically ‘extreme’ text, given its inconsistency with Michael Riffaterre’s frequently quoted definition of testimony and the moral questions it raises. It is important, therefore, to examine the particular nature of these texts: why does the perpetrator choose to testify, how does he establish his ethos, to whom does he speak, and what are the precise conditions and circumstances of his discourse? Can a perpetrator even be considered a witness in the strict sense of the word? Argumentation theory and discourse analysis as formulated by Ruth Amossy and Dominique Maingueneau recognise the social, political and cultural dimension of discourse and provide a theoretical instrument to tackle some of the most insistent questions. Perpetrator’s testimonies call for a particular mise en scène. The process of ‘relaying’ or ‘mediating’, for example, the Nazi’s point of view, inevitably raises questions of agency and ethical responsibility, compelling mediators to disclose their own moral position and leave traces of their presence in the text. Discursive strategies indeed allow them to inject their own voice into the text, thus producing a critical counterdiscourse that can manipulate the text’s interpretation and possibly even undermine its key positions. The polyphony of the Rwandan corpus constitutes an important cue for drafting a suitable theoretical framework. The thesis also aims to take part in the debate around translation and authorship, looking for possibilities for translators to convey their ‘attitude’ (Theo Hermans) towards the perpetrator’s discourse without jeopardizing the idea of a ‘faithful’ translation. Anneleen Spiessens thus assesses the importance of editorial and translational framing as ethical positioning and argumentation, disclosing the resulting polyphonic configuration of the <b>mediated</b> <b>testimony.</b> The figure of the perpetrator, as well as his narration, will be connected to its literary representation in order to investigate the relation between document and fiction. What does the fictional génocidaire look like? What part does he play in the overall narrative setting of the novel? And what does this character allow us to see or think? While Robert Merle’s fictional autobiography is still firmly-rooted in history, correlating the protagonist with his historical model, Littell and Gatore take a different approach. While they also transform their novels, like Merle, into heuristic tools, their perpetrators are implausible: consumed by remorse or regrets, they think or speak torrentially. The PhD examines the consequences of this resolute choice for fiction, both for literature itself and for our understanding of reality...|$|R
40|$|Triggered by {{a recent}} {{interesting}} New Scientist article on the too frequent incorrect use of probabilistic evidence in courts, I introduce the basic concepts of probabilistic inference with a toy model, and discuss several important issues {{that need to be}} understood in order to extend the basic reasoning to real life cases. In particular, I emphasize the often neglected point that degrees of beliefs are updated not by `bare facts' alone, but by all available information pertaining to them, including how they have been acquired. In this light I show that, contrary to what claimed in that article, there was no "probabilistic pitfall" in the Columbo's episode pointed as example of "bad mathematics" yielding "rough justice". Instead, such a criticism could have a `negative reaction' to the article itself and to the use of Bayesian reasoning in courts, as well as in all other places in which probabilities need to be assessed and decisions need to be made. Anyway, besides introductory/recreational aspects, the paper touches important questions, like: role and evaluation of priors; subjective evaluation of Bayes factors; role and limits of intuition; `weights of evidence' and `intensities of beliefs' (following Peirce) and `judgments leaning' (here introduced), including their uncertainties and combinations; role of relative frequencies to assess and express beliefs; pitfalls due to `standard' statistical education; weight of evidences <b>mediated</b> by <b>testimonies.</b> A small introduction to Bayesian networks, based on the same toy model (complicated by the possibility of incorrect testimonies) and implemented using Hugin software, is also provided, to stress the importance of formal, computer aided probabilistic reasoning.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} {{narrative}} theory and discourse analysis {{to explore the}} role and positioning of editors and translators {{in relation to the}} texts they mediate. Mona Baker has argued that mediators “face a basic ethical choice with every assignment” (2006) : they either reproduce the ideologies encoded in the original narrative or they dissociate themselves from these ideologies. Translating or <b>mediating</b> the perpetrator’s <b>testimony</b> therefore inevitably raises questions of ethical and social responsibility, and of accountability. When dealing with texts they strongly disagree with, like Nazi testimonies in this case, mediating agents are indeed compelled to disclose their own moral position and to leave traces of their presence in the text. They can use various strategies to actively ‘frame’ the original narrative and inject it with their own voice, thus producing a counter discourse that opposes and potentially even sabotages the perpetrator’s discourse. In an analysis of different translations of Rudolph Hoess’s autobiography, Kommandant in Auschwitz (1958), I will assess the importance of editorial and translational framing as ethical positioning and argumentation, in order to disclose the resulting polyphonic – or “multivocal” (Hermans 2007) – configuration...|$|R
40|$|Restricted until 16 July 2014. This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} the interrelationship between institutional and individual practices <b>mediates</b> video <b>testimonies</b> of the Holocaust, revealing that formal practices and institutional infrastructures influence {{not only the}} process of testimonial production but also a testimony's reception. In doing so, it extends the existing range of scholarship on archived Holocaust testimony, which has primarily explored its ethical, narrative, and psychoanalytic dimensions. Such analysis is particularly urgent given the expansion of Holocaust testimony archives {{in recent years in}} anticipation of the passing of the survivor community and the transition from living memory to postmemory. The dissertation will serve as a critical intervention for considering how survivor testimonies are preserved for future generations that will have no direct access to witnesses.; This study focuses on three archives and memorial sites in the United States: the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the USC Shoah Foundation Institute. Each site embodies distinct yet intersecting institutional histories and approaches to the collection of testimony. That is not to suggest, however, that their archival structures somehow determine the meanings and use value of their respective holdings. While certain infrastructures serve to advance representational preferences, the spontaneous and fragmentary dimensions of personal memory sometimes impede any integration with or subordination to archival preferences for using testimony. By examining specific interviews in relation to their institutional frameworks, this study demonstrates how the traumatic registers of memory often disrupt the particular itineraries of institutions gathering video accounts of witnesses.; Ultimately, this dissertation argues that with the emergence of postmemory, it is essential to cultivate new methodologies and approaches to collecting and transmitting testimonies that train our sensitivity to their lived, physical origins as well as to institutional practices. Testimony can never be reduced to its empirical historical content or raw visceral impact. Thus, this dissertation will investigate testimony as an individually and institutionally embedded and embodied practice framed by a diverse range of aims and preferences...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{resurgence}} of interview-based verbatim theatre in the 21 st century and scholarly debate surrounding the aesthetics and authenticity of verbatim plays, little examination {{of the role of}} the playwright integrating testimonies of war into the making of a verbatim play has been undertaken. The transactional relationships between interviewees and playwrights warrant study as this critical interaction informs the dramaturgy of the playtext. This area of inquiry also has significant resonance in debates regarding the ethics of representation in verbatim theatre, particularly as many contemporary verbatim plays examining conflict tend to incorporate testimony from interviewees whose lives have been affected by war and militarism. What follows is a practice-as-research (PaR) -led investigation into my role as a playwright appropriating testimony from individual subjects affected by conflict. Through the creation of two verbatim plays, namely This Much is True and Yardbird, this investigation examines moments of disjuncture that occur when <b>mediating</b> war-related <b>testimony.</b> In addition to critically reflecting on the creative component of this inquiry, this dissertation also incorporates original interviews conducted with the creative team behind the National Theatre of Scotland’s play Black Watch and examines more broadly the methodologies of playwrights working with trauma-related experiences by focusing on how playwrights’ interactions with individual subjects inform the shaping of a play. This investigation examines the key issues that emerge as playwrights integrate personal testimony in a theatrical translation of subjects’ experiences into the writing of a verbatim play. It also seeks to examine the ethical tensions I encountered within my verbatim playwriting practice. Furthermore, this investigation interrogates my process of locating interview subjects and facilitating testimony; maintaining critical relationships with interviewees; organising the structure of the play; and negotiating interview subjects’ autonomy over the script. Rather than generating codified guidelines for ethical verbatim practice, the findings and deliberations of my investigation are designed to assist other practitioners using personal testimony from interviewees as part of the playwriting process. Encouraging practitioners to critically reflect on the methods that they employ within the interview stages as part of the playwriting process helps to lay bare the ethical and aesthetic responsibilities involved in dramatising war-related testimony. These deliberations are offered for the benefit of other theatre practitioners as well as scholars working within the wider field of theatre studies...|$|R
