5|$|As {{well as the}} {{evolution}} of new <b>metabolic</b> pathways, evolution can also cause the loss of <b>metabolic</b> functions. For example, in some parasites <b>metabolic</b> processes that are not essential for survival are lost and preformed amino acids, nucleotides and carbohydrates may instead be scavenged from the host. Similar reduced <b>metabolic</b> capabilities are seen in endosymbiotic organisms.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels {{are often}} useful in {{scientific}} studies on animal physiology, and are typically captured using the bal-chatri method or raised in nest boxes for experiments. Kestrel <b>metabolic</b> rate {{has been found}} to increase in response to rainfall, and at ambient temperatures below about 25⁰ C. Kestrel <b>metabolic</b> responses to weather and temperature do not vary, however, with sex. Kestrels will increase their oxygen consumption, and therefore their <b>metabolic</b> rate in cold and wet conditions to counteract heat loss.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{and plants}} {{have evolved to}} {{synthesise}} {{a vast array of}} poisonous products including secondary metabolites, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most <b>metabolic</b> processes. The <b>metabolic</b> processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in <b>metabolic</b> pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, paclitaxel (taxol), an organic molecule found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to tubulin dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E
5|$|In mammals, this <b>metabolic</b> pathway is {{important}} in beta oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of amino acids and choline, as it accepts electrons from multiple acetyl-CoA dehydrogenases. In plants, ETF-Q oxidoreductase is also important in the <b>metabolic</b> responses that allow survival in extended periods of darkness.|$|E
5|$|Obesity and <b>metabolic</b> {{syndrome}} {{are both}} {{closely related to}} plasma triglyceride levels. Therefore, the focus on an association between APOA5 and BMI or <b>metabolic</b> syndrome is understandable. Available studies show that minor APOA5 alleles could be associated with an enhanced risk of obesity or <b>metabolic</b> syndrome development. However, genome wide studies have failed to prove that APOA5 is a gene associated with BMI values and/or obesity, so the effect could be far from clinically significant or at least significantly context-dependent.|$|E
5|$|One set of {{characteristics}} relate to body size and temperature. The <b>metabolic</b> theory of ecology provides a predictive qualitative set {{of relationships between}} an organism’s body size and temperature and <b>metabolic</b> processes. In general, smaller, warmer organisms have higher <b>metabolic</b> rates and {{this results in a}} variety of predictions regarding individual somatic growth rates, reproduction and population growth rates, population size, and resource uptake rates.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of how this find reflects <b>metabolic</b> rate and dinosaur internal anatomy is moot, though, regardless of the object's identity. Both modern crocodilians and birds, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, have four-chambered hearts (albeit modified in crocodilians), so dinosaurs probably had them as well; the structure is not necessarily tied to <b>metabolic</b> rate.|$|E
5|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metabolism is {{the similarity of}} the basic <b>metabolic</b> pathways and components between even vastly different species. For example, the set of carboxylic acids that are {{best known as the}} intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli and huge multicellular organisms like elephants. These striking similarities in <b>metabolic</b> pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E
5|$|AMPK {{probably}} {{also plays a}} role in increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some <b>metabolic</b> actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms; the <b>metabolic</b> actions of metformin in the heart muscle can occur independent of changes in AMPK activity and may be mediated by p38 MAPK- and PKC-dependent mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|As the environments of most {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} changing, {{the reactions of}} metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis. <b>Metabolic</b> regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments. Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how <b>metabolic</b> pathways are controlled. Firstly, the regulation of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the control exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway). For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (i.e. it is highly regulated) but if these changes have {{little effect on the}} flux of a <b>metabolic</b> pathway, then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} ratites, emus have a {{relatively}} low basal <b>metabolic</b> rate compared to other types of birds. At , the <b>metabolic</b> rate of an emu sitting down is about 60% of that when standing, partly because the lack of feathers under the stomach leads to {{a higher rate of}} heat loss when standing from the exposed underbelly.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria exhibit an {{extremely}} {{wide variety of}} <b>metabolic</b> types. The distribution of <b>metabolic</b> traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their taxonomy, but these traits often do not correspond with modern genetic classifications. Bacterial metabolism is classified into nutritional groups {{on the basis of}} three major criteria: the kind of energy used for growth, the source of carbon, and the electron donors used for growth. An additional criterion of respiratory microorganisms are the electron acceptors used for aerobic or anaerobic respiration.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are also}} {{important}} in <b>metabolic</b> control. Many <b>metabolic</b> pathways in the cell are inhibited by metabolites that control enzyme activity through allosteric regulation or substrate inhibition. A good example is the allosteric regulation of the glycolytic pathway. This catabolic pathway consumes glucose and produces ATP, NADH and pyruvate. A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1). When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an allosteric site in PFK1 to decrease {{the rate of the}} enzyme reaction; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls. This negative feedback control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP in the cell. However, <b>metabolic</b> pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important. With respect to PFK1, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and ADP are examples of metabolites that are allosteric activators.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{determine}} what steps occur in these pathways. Without enzymes, metabolism would neither {{progress through the}} same steps {{and could not be}} regulated to serve the needs of the cell. Most central <b>metabolic</b> pathways are regulated at a few key steps, typically through enzymes whose activity involves the hydrolysis of ATP. Because this reaction releases so much energy, other reactions that are thermodynamically unfavorable can be coupled to ATP hydrolysis, driving the overall series of linked <b>metabolic</b> reactions.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have low}} basal <b>metabolic</b> rates (BMR), which helps them to {{conserve}} energy {{during the dry}} season, when water and food are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their <b>metabolic</b> rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass. The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly {{has one of the}} lowest <b>metabolic</b> rates among mammals. Its low <b>metabolic</b> rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss and conserve energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located {{at the base of the}} tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the dry season, their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.|$|E
5|$|Methylmalonic acidemia – an {{autosomal}} recessive <b>metabolic</b> disorder that mimics {{the effects of}} ethylene glycol poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Several enzymes {{can work}} {{together}} in a specific order, creating <b>metabolic</b> pathways. In a <b>metabolic</b> pathway, one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate. After the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed on to another enzyme. Sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyze the same reaction in parallel; this can allow more complex regulation: with, for example, a low constant activity provided by one enzyme but an inducible high activity from a second enzyme.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol is {{the site}} of most {{metabolism}} in prokaryotes, and {{a large proportion of the}} metabolism of eukaryotes. For instance, in mammals about half of the proteins in the cell are localized to the cytosol. The most complete data are available in yeast, where <b>metabolic</b> reconstructions indicate that the majority of both <b>metabolic</b> processes and metabolites occur in the cytosol. Major <b>metabolic</b> pathways that occur in the cytosol in animals are protein biosynthesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. The localization of pathways can be different in other organisms, for instance fatty acid synthesis occurs in chloroplasts in plants to functional genomics |journal=Biochem. Soc. Trans. |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=567–73 |date=December 2000 |pmid=11171129 |doi=10.1042/BST0280567}} and in apicoplasts in apicomplexa.|$|E
5|$|The <b>metabolic</b> {{system of}} a {{particular}} organism determines which substances it will find nutritious and which poisonous. For example, some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide as a nutrient, yet this gas is poisonous to animals. The speed of metabolism, the <b>metabolic</b> rate, influences how much food an organism will require, and also affects how {{it is able to}} obtain that food.|$|E
25|$|The <b>metabolic</b> {{syndrome}} quintuples {{the risk}} of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes is considered a complication of <b>metabolic</b> syndrome. In people with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose, presence of <b>metabolic</b> syndrome doubles {{the risk of}} developing type 2 diabetes. It is likely that prediabetes and <b>metabolic</b> syndrome denote the same disorder, defining it by the different sets of biological markers.|$|E
25|$|It has {{not been}} contested that {{cardiovascular}} risk factors tend to cluster together; the matter of contention has been the assertion that the <b>metabolic</b> syndrome is anything {{more than the sum}} of its constituent parts. Phenotypic heterogeneity (for example, represented by variation in <b>metabolic</b> syndrome factor combinations among individuals with <b>metabolic</b> syndrome) has fueled that debate. However, more recent evidence suggests that common triggers (for example, excessive sugar-intake in the environment of overabundant food) can contribute to the development of multiple <b>metabolic</b> abnormalities at the same time, supporting the commonality of the energy utilization and storage pathways in <b>metabolic</b> syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>metabolic</b> bone {{diseases}} such as Paget's disease, osteomalacia, osteopetrosis and osteogenesis imperfecta. Stress fractures may occur in the hip region with <b>metabolic</b> bone disease.|$|E
25|$|The graph {{shows the}} <b>metabolic</b> rate {{for males and}} females. By visual inspection, {{it appears that the}} {{variability}} of the <b>metabolic</b> rate is greater for males than for females.|$|E
25|$|Catabolism is the <b>metabolic</b> {{reaction}} which cells undergo {{to extract}} energy. There {{are two major}} <b>metabolic</b> pathways of monosaccharide catabolism: glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.|$|E
25|$|During {{their time}} in hibernation, bears' heart rate drops from 40–50 beats per minute to 8 beats per minute, and <b>metabolic</b> rate can drop to {{a quarter of a}} bear's (non-hibernating) basal <b>metabolic</b> rate (BMR). These {{reductions}} in <b>metabolic</b> rate and heart rate do not appear to decrease the bear's ability to heal injuries during hibernation.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{there seems}} to be a {{trade-off}} between the noise in gene expression, the speed with which genes can switch, and the <b>metabolic</b> cost associated their functioning. More specifically, for any given level of <b>metabolic</b> cost, there is an optimal trade-off between noise and processing speed and increasing the <b>metabolic</b> cost leads to better speed-noise trade-offs.|$|E
25|$|While the <b>metabolic</b> rate {{is highest}} at 32°C, colonies often thrive at {{slightly}} cooler temperatures (around 25°C). The {{high rate of}} <b>metabolic</b> activity associated with warmer temperatures is a limiting factor on colony growth because the need for food consumption is also increased. As a result, larger colonies tend {{to be found in}} cooler conditions because the <b>metabolic</b> demands required to sustain a colony are decreased.|$|E
25|$|Low resting <b>metabolic</b> rates—which {{would reduce}} the amount of food they needed and allow them to use more of that food for growth than do animals with high resting <b>metabolic</b> rates.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D {{deficiency}} {{may play}} some {{role in the}} development of the <b>metabolic</b> syndrome, so treatment of any such deficiency is indicated. However, a systematic review of 2015 found no evidence that vitamin D supplementation reduced or mitigated <b>metabolic</b> and hormonal dysregulations in PCOS. As of 2012, interventions using dietary supplements to correct <b>metabolic</b> deficiencies in people with PCOS had been tested in small, uncontrolled and nonrandomized clinical trials; the resulting data is insufficient to recommend their use.|$|E
25|$|The <b>metabolic</b> {{theory of}} ecology (MTE) is an {{extension}} of Kleiber's law and posits that the <b>metabolic</b> rate of organisms is the fundamental biological rate that governs most observed patterns in ecology. MTE {{is part of a larger}} set of theory known as <b>metabolic</b> scaling theory that attempts to provide a unified theory for the importance of metabolism in driving pattern and process in biology from the level of cells all the way to the biosphere.|$|E
25|$|There are {{additional}} non-canonical roles of BCL-2 {{that are being}} explored. BCL-2 is known to regulate mitochondrial dynamics, and {{is involved in the}} regulation of mitochondrial fusion and fission. Additionally, in pancreatic beta-cells, BCL-2 and BCL-Xl are known to be involved in controlling <b>metabolic</b> activity and insulin secretion, with inhibition of BCL-2/Xl showing increasing <b>metabolic</b> activity, but also additional ROS production; this suggests it has a protective <b>metabolic</b> effect in conditions of high demand.|$|E
25|$|Direct glucuronidation and {{cytochrome}} P450 mediated oxidation are {{the primary}} <b>metabolic</b> pathways for olanzapine. In vitro studies suggest that CYPs 1A2 and 2D6, and the flavin-containing monooxygenase system are involved in olanzapine oxidation. CYP2D6 mediated oxidation {{appears to be a}} minor <b>metabolic</b> pathway in vivo.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metabolic</b> {{syndrome}} {{is associated with}} the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. In the USA, {{about a quarter of the}} adult population have <b>metabolic</b> syndrome, and the prevalence increases with age, with racial and ethnic minorities being particularly affected.|$|E
25|$|To {{deal with}} {{decreased}} ATP production through the electron transport chain, fish must activate anaerobic means of energy production (see anaerobic metabolism) while suppressing <b>metabolic</b> demands. The ability to decrease energy demand by <b>metabolic</b> suppression {{is essential to}} ensure hypoxic survival due to the limited efficiency of anaerobic ATP production.|$|E
25|$|The {{involvement}} of the endocannabinoid system {{in the development of}} <b>metabolic</b> syndrome is indisputable. Endocannabinoid overproduction may induce reward system dysfunction and cause executive dysfunctions (e.g., impaired delay discounting), in turn perpetuating unhealthy behaviors. The brain is crucial in development of <b>metabolic</b> syndrome, modulating peripheral carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.|$|E
25|$|According to {{estimates}} from the American Heart Association, more than 9% of U.S. {{children and adolescents}} aged 12–19, or nearly three million individuals, have the <b>metabolic</b> syndrome. Among overweight and obese adolescents, this prevalence rate rises to 44%. Two-thirds of adolescents {{have at least one}} <b>metabolic</b> abnormality.|$|E
