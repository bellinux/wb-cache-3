5000|$|Fires - The {{arc length}} at 15 kV is {{in excess of}} 5 cm (2 in). Keep wiring inside {{grounded}} 12mm (1/2") <b>metallic</b> <b>conduit</b> (watertight if applicable). Be sure to use proper enclosures for transformers. Stray electric arcs will ignite combustible materials.|$|E
50|$|All {{equipment}} in Division 1 areas {{must have an}} approval label, but certain materials, such as rigid <b>metallic</b> <b>conduit,</b> {{does not have a}} specific label indicating the Cl./Div.1 suitability and their listing as approved method of installation in the NEC serves as the permission. Some {{equipment in}} Division 2 areas do not require a specific label, such as standard 3 phase induction motors that do not contain normally arcing components.|$|E
50|$|Liquidtight {{flexible}} metal conduit (LFMC) is a <b>metallic</b> flexible <b>conduit</b> covered by a waterproof plastic coating. The interior is similar to FMC.|$|R
40|$|<b>Metallic</b> <b>conduits</b> provide {{mechanical}} {{support for}} cables, {{and may also}} protect the cables against interference caused by currents induced by external electromagnetic fields. The conduit transfer impedance Zt then is a good measure for the provided protection. We studied Zt by means of conformal transformations and of the method of moments in a quasistatic, two-dimensional (2 -D) approach. Practical U-, H-, L-, and T-shaped conduits are discussed. Conformal transformations provide simple engineering expressions for the mutual inductance part of Zt for cable positions inside the conduit. The method of moments formulation results in useful approximations for the crossover frequencies in Zt between DC and high frequency. Measurements on U-shaped conduits confirm the calculation...|$|R
5000|$|Fiberglass-reinforced epoxy (FRE), or {{fiberglass}} conduit, {{also known}} as reinforced thermosetting resin conduit (RTRC) [...] is light in weight compared to <b>metallic</b> <b>conduits,</b> which contributes to lower labor costs. It may also provide lower material cost. RTRC conduit {{can be used in}} a variety of indoor and outdoor applications. [...] Fiberglass conduit is available in multiple wall thicknesses to suit various applications and has a support distance very similar to steel. High temperature, low smoke, no flame, classified area (Class I Division 2), and zero halogen versions are also manufactured for specialty applications such as subway tunnels and stations and in the US can meet NFPA 130 requirements. Like other non-metallic conduits, a bonding conductor may be required for grounding. Joints are epoxy-glued, which requires some installation labor and time for joints to set. FRE conduit may not be bent in the field and appropriate fittings must be used to change directions, nor is FRE conduit approved to support luminaires.|$|R
50|$|Flexible <b>metallic</b> <b>conduit</b> (FMC, informally called {{greenfield}} or flex) {{is made by}} the helical coiling of a self-interlocked ribbed {{strip of}} aluminum or steel, forming a hollow tube through which wires can be pulled. FMC is used primarily in dry areas {{where it would be}} impractical to install EMT or other non-flexible conduit, yet where metallic strength to protect conductors is still required. The flexible tubing does not maintain any permanent bend, and can flex freely.|$|E
5000|$|Flexible {{metallic}} tubing (FMT; North America) is not {{the same}} as flexible <b>metallic</b> <b>conduit</b> (FMC) which is described in US National Electrical Code (NEC) Article 348. FMT is a raceway, but not a conduit and is described in a separate NEC Article 360. It only comes in 1/2" [...] & 3/4" [...] trade sizes, whereas FMC is sized 1/2" [...] ~ 4" [...] trade sizes. NEC 360.2 describes it as: [...] "A raceway that is circular in cross section, flexible, metallic and liquidtight without a nonmetallic jacket." ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{test results}} {{indicated}} drawbacks {{associated with the}} simple exponential attenuation method (SEAM) as currently applied to neutron radiography measurements to determine vapor fractions in a hydrogenous two-phase flow in a <b>metallic</b> <b>conduit.</b> The scattering component of the neutron beam intensity exiting the flow system is not adequately accounted for by SEAM, and this leads to inaccurate results. To properly account for the scattering effect, a neutron scattering probability method (SPM) is developed. The method applies a neutron-hydrogen scattering kernel to scattered thermal neutrons that leave the incident beam in narrow conduits but eventually show up elsewhere in the measurements. The SPM has been tested with known vapor (void) distributions within an acrylic disk and a water/vapor channel. The vapor (void) fractions deduced by SPM are in good agreement with the known exact values. Details of the scattering correction method and the test results are discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Metallic</b> trays and <b>conduits</b> protect {{bundles of}} cables in {{electrotechnical}} installations by diversion of interference currents. The relevant parameter is the conduit transfer impedance Zi. Conformal transformations yield the inductive part M of Zi for conduits with noncontacting covers. Analytical approximations for M agree well with measurement...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of soil-steel structures is {{examined in this}} research. The analysis accounts for the behaviour and the induced stresses in soil and conduit during construction and loading. An analytical procedure using plane strain finite elements has been developed to study the different aspects of soil-steel structure instability. The conduit is represented by beam-column finite elements with the capability of accommodating plastic hinges when necessary. Interface elements of a spring type are used to represent the linkage between the two materials. Linear and constant strain elements are used to simulate the soil media, depending on {{the severity of the}} stress gradient of the structure. Two soil models are used to model the behaviour of the soil elements, a nonlinear elastic hyperbolic model as well as an elasto-plastic soil model. The parameters defining these models are obtained through triaxial compression tests. Geometric and material nonlinearities are considered in the analysis. Direct iterations are used to update the material properties. Failure in the soil elements is identified and followed by correction to the stress state in the whole structure. In{{stability of}} the structure, whether initiated by yielding of the soil mass above the conduit, excessive deflection of the conduit, buckling of the <b>metallic</b> <b>conduit</b> or by instability of the soil-steel structure is predicted. The results obtained by the computer program are checked with a series of laboratory tests carried out for this purpose. Comparisons with tests reported in other references and with Code Specifications are also made. Reasonable agreement is reached between the analytical and experimental results. Based on this agreement, a parametric study of the variables controlling the soil-steel structure stability is carried out. The height of soil cover, span and shape of the conduit, load type rigidity of the conduit walls and interface stiffness are among these variables. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
