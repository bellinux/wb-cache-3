40|$|Secondary {{steelmaking}} plays a great role {{in enhancing}} {{the quality of}} the final steel product. The metal quality is a function of metal bath stirring in ladles. The metal bath is often stirred by an inert gas to achieve maximum compositional and thermal uniformity throughout the <b>melt.</b> <b>Ladle</b> operators often observe the top surface phenomena, such as level of meniscus disturbance, to evaluate the status of stirring. However, this type of monitoring has significant limitations in assessing the process accurately especially at low gas flow rate bubbling. The present study investigates stirring phenomena using ladle wall triaxial vibration at a low flow rate on a steel-made laboratory model and plant scale for the case of the vacuum tank degasser. Cold model and plant data were successfully modeled by partial least-squares regression to predict the amount of stirring. In the cold model, {{it was found that the}} combined vibration signal could predict the stirring power and recirculation speed effectively in specific frequency ranges. Plant trials also revealed that there is a high structure in each data set and in the same frequency ranges at the water model. In the case of industrial data, the degree of linear relationship was strong for data taken from a single heat...|$|R

5000|$|A minimill is {{traditionally}} a secondary steel producer; however, Nucor (one of the world's largest steel producers), {{as well as}} one of its competitors, [...] Commercial Metals Company (CMC) use minimills exclusively. Usually it obtains most of its iron from scrap steel, recycled from used automobiles and equipment or byproducts of manufacturing. Direct reduced iron (DRI) is sometimes used with scrap, to help maintain desired chemistry of the steel, though usually DRI is too expensive to use as the primary raw steelmaking material. A typical mini-mill will have an electric arc furnace for scrap <b>melting,</b> a <b>ladle</b> furnace or vacuum furnace for precision control of chemistry, a strip or billet continuous caster for converting molten steel to solid form, a reheat furnace and a rolling mill.|$|R
40|$|The hydrogasodynamics and {{technology}} a of melt treatment out of furnace by high-implused jets of neutral gas were studied. The {{conception of a}} jet synthesis, blowing regimes and devices to solve problems of <b>melt</b> treatment in <b>ladle</b> was developed. The appropriatenesses of melt degassing and homogenizig in ladle at the blowing by trans- and ultrasonic jets of neutral gas were obtained experimentaly. The approptiatenesses of gas-powder jets outflow were studied and {{a new class of}} blowing regimes and devices for powder material injection was developed. The principles of construction and optimization of regime parameters of blowing devices, regimes and devices for melt degassing by trans- and ultrasonic jets of neutral gas to inject the powder materials in a melt, technological decisions, concerning the correction of the chemical composition and temperature of a <b>melt</b> in <b>ladle</b> were developed. The principles of a temperature melting regime optimization were developed. The results obtained were applied in the West-Siberian Metallurgical works. The increase of the metal quality allowed to decrease the reject by 20 - 30 %. The yield of steel was increased by 0, 1 - 0, 3 %, the steel temperature on tap was decreased by 10 - 25 % the specific expense of cast iron was decreased by 2 - 4 kg/t, the ferroalloy expense was reduced by 3 - 8 %.

50|$|In a steel plant, a {{ladle furnace}} (LF) {{is used to}} {{maintain}} the temperature of liquid steel during processing after tapping from EAF or to change the alloy composition. The ladle {{is used for the}} first purpose when there is a delay later in the steelmaking process. The ladle furnace consists of a refractory roof, a heating system, and, when applicable, a provision for injecting argon gas {{into the bottom of the}} melt for stirring. Unlike a scrap <b>melting</b> furnace, a <b>ladle</b> furnace does not have a tilting or scrap charging mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The current {{trend is}} to avoid very {{expensive}} and very heavy elements. An example is Eglin steel, a budget material with compromised temperature range and chemical resistance. It does not contain rhenium or ruthenium and its nickel content is limited. To reduce fabrication costs, it was chemically designed to <b>melt</b> in a <b>ladle</b> (though with improved properties in a vacuum crucible). Also, conventional welding and casting is possible before heat-treatment. The original purpose was to produce high-performance, inexpensive bomb casings, but the material has proven widely applicable to structural applications, including armor.|$|R
50|$|Unless the ladle {{is to be}} {{used with}} alloys that have very low {{temperature}} <b>melting</b> point, the <b>ladle</b> is also fitted with a refractory lining. It is the refractory lining that stops the steel vessel from suffering damage when the ladle is used to transport metals with high melting temperatures that, if the molten metal came in direct contact with the ladle shell, would rapidly melt through the shell. Refractory lining materials come in many forms and the right choice very much depends on each foundry's working practices. Traditionally ladles used to be lined using pre-cast firebricks however refractory concretes have tended to supersede these in many countries.|$|R
30|$|Alloy wheels {{constitute}} a very prominent aspect of an automobile. This {{is because it}} forms {{an integral part of}} overall visual esthetic appeal of the automobile. The A 356 aluminum alloy with 7 % silicon as its prime alloying element forms the popular material for the manufacture of automotive alloy wheel castings. The alloy wheel manufacturing process starts with ingots which form the input into the furnace of the <b>melting</b> section. After <b>ladle</b> preheating, the liquid metal treatment (degassing) is performed in the melting section. The die in the die maintenance area is preheated and sandblasted in order to clean the die surface, increase the surface finish and relieve the external surface stresses. Then, the prepared die is preserved in the Die preservation yard. As per the production schedule the required die is retrieved from the die preservation yard and then fitted onto the low-pressure die cast (LPDC) machine unit.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Switching {{transients}} {{associated with}} circuit breakers {{have been observed}} for many years. With the widespread applica-tion of vacuum breakers for transformer switching, recently, this phenomenon {{has been attributed to}} a significant number of trans-former failures. Vacuum circuit breaker switching of electric arc furnace and <b>ladle</b> <b>melt</b> furnace (LMF) transformers raises concern because of their inductive currents. High-frequency transients and overvoltages result when the vacuum breaker exhibits virtual current chop and multiple re-ignitions. This paper will present a detailed case study of vacuum breaker switching of a new LMF transformer involving current chopping and restrike simulations using the electromagnetic transients program. A technique that involves a combination of surge arresters and snubbers will be applied to the LMF to show that the switching transients can be successfully mitigated. Additionally, some practical aspects of the physical design and installation of the snubber will be discussed.

40|$|The {{purpose is}} {{studying}} the effect of technological parameters of extra-furnace treatment and continuous casting {{on the development of}} the metal re-oxidation processes, investigating the dynamics of the oxidation degree of steel in the course of deoxidation, holding the <b>melting</b> in a <b>ladle</b> and its continuous subsequent casting, as well as the development of an efficient gas-dynamic means of protection of the metal at transferring the steel into an intermediate ladle and mould UNRS. The quantity of oxygen getting into the metal from the atmosphere, of slag and the level of lining at ladle treatment have been determined through balance calculations of redistribution of the component in the metal and slag.

40|$|One of the {{production}} methods for API line pipe steel is electric resistance welding (ERW). This kind of pipes is encountered with hook crack {{which is one of}} the defects that is observed in the upset zone of ERW pipes, detecting by ultrasonic inspection. Hook crack is a small crack following the weld flow lines and if severe enough, opened up at the pipe surface. These defects were commonly associated with sulphide stringers and non metallic oxide inclusions. In this research, welds containing hook cracks were obtained from Ahvaz pipe making factory. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) examination showed that all hook cracks were associated with small non metallic inclusions and X-ray microprobe analysis (EDX) was performed to detect the main elements associated with the inclusion. Hook cracks were found to be associated with Al 2 O 3, CaO, CaS and MgO. This work revealed that these defects can be eliminated using; calcium treatment and Argon stirring improvement in ladle furnace, also using tundish refractory with higher quality and control of <b>melt</b> flow in <b>ladle</b> furnace and tundish...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is {{generally}} {{well known that}} a steelmaking ladle operation {{plays an important role}} in the production of clean steel. A turbulent mixing of melt with Ar gas bubbling from the ladle bottom can homogenize a melt temperature and can control precisely chemical compositions of steel. In order to figure out these phenomena, a quantitative analysis of fluid flow behavior of gas and <b>melt</b> during a <b>ladle</b> operation is required and special concerns should be focused on effects of operating parameters on the perfect mixing time of melt. In this study, as a basic approach, effects of operating parameters such as a melt depth (aspect ratio) and a nozzle type (one-hole or porous plug) on the mixing behavior in ladle operation are investigated. Water model experiments are carried out to simulate these melt behaviors in steelmaking ladle. As a result, it was found that there exist an optimized melt depth and a nozzle type at a given gas flow rate, which affect significantly on the mixing behavior of melt...|$|R
5000|$|The alloy {{to undergo}} VAR is formed into a {{cylinder}} typically by vacuum induction <b>melting</b> (VIM) or <b>ladle</b> refining (airmelt). This cylinder, {{referred to as}} an electrode is then put into a large cylindrical enclosed crucible and brought to a metallurgical vacuum (...) [...] At {{the bottom of the}} crucible is a small amount of the alloy to be remelted, which the top electrode is brought close to prior to starting the melt. Several kiloamperes of DC current are used to start an arc between the two pieces, and from there, a continuous melt is derived. The crucible (typically made of copper) is surrounded by a water jacket used to cool the melt and control the solidification rate. To prevent arcing between the electrode and the crucible side walls, the diameter of the crucible is larger than that of the electrode. As a result, the electrode must be lowered as the melt consumes it. Control of the current, cooling water, and electrode gap is essential to effective control of the process, and production of defect free material.|$|R
