The group included fifteen who were tried in absentia. In 2009, the process was split for Milan Tepavac and Ilija Vorkapić who were available to Croatian authorities, and once <b>more</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> later when Tepavac was judged not fit to stand trial.

25|$|Gentlemen v Players was a {{first-class}} cricket match generally held in England twice or <b>more</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> {{for well over}} a century. It was held between teams consisting of amateurs (the Gentlemen) and professionals (the Players). The difference between the two was defined by the English class structure of the time, with the Players deemed to be working-class wage-earners and the Gentlemen members of the middle and upper classes, usually products of the English public school system. Whereas the Players were paid wages by their county clubs or fees by match organisers, the Gentlemen nominally claimed expenses. The whole subject of expenses was controversial and it was held that some leading amateurs were paid more for playing cricket than any professional.|$|E
25|$|Criticism {{has been}} {{directed}} at the cost to users of the SmartRider system compared to its predecessor, the MultiRider. While the MultiRider could be bought as a 40-ride ticket for a 25% discount, a lesser 20% discount can now only be obtained by paying by direct debit, which {{can take up to}} 3 weeks to activate. A 10% discount is available for all other methods of payment. This was raised in Parliament by Liberal MP Katie Hodson-Thomas, who claimed that passengers would end up paying $324 <b>more</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> for public transport under SmartRider. In February 2006, The West Australian reported criticism by trial users who claimed that their failure to tag off, either by accidentally forgetting to do so or due to a non-working machine, resulted in a four-zone fare being charged to the SmartRider regardless of distance travelled.|$|E

He faced no internal or external threats (although Portuguese Goa considered it was technically at war with Burma for her interference in Ceylon). Instead of resting, he turned his gaze on Arakan, the kingdom he and Tabinshwehti unsuccessfully tried to conquer in 1545–1547. He determined that it was now time to reduce the western coastal kingdom to the vassal status it held under the Pagan kings once <b>more.</b> <b>A</b> <b>year</b> earlier, he had sent an embassy to Emperor Akbar of the Mughal Empire, which had just acquired Bengal in 1576, perhaps to ascertain whether his occupation of Arakan would be viewed as an act of hostility to the Mughals.|$|E

[...] Fitzpatrick noted that the demand was so great that a Michigan athlete could command $400 to $500 <b>more</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> in salary than students from other schools, and an All-Western player from Michigan's football team could command a salary of $1,500 for three months' work.

2500|$|Issues arose after Santorum was {{defeated}} for re-election to the Senate in 2006, and Senator Craig Thomas began his {{tenure at the}} candy desk. Wyoming, the state he was representing, has no members of the National Confectioners Association, and therefore no candymakers large enough to donate hundreds of dollars of candy to fill the desk. Senate ethics rules [...] "forbid members accepting gifts worth $100 or <b>more</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> from a single source," [...] which can become a problem if {{a large amount of}} candy is consumed from the desk each year. An exception to this rule allows larger gifts of objects created or produced in the state the senator is from, as long as the items are primarily not used by the senator and his staff. This is so senators can [...] "offer visitors home-grown snacks, such as Florida orange juice or Georgia peanuts." [...] When asked about Thomas being in charge of the candy desk, Susan Smith, a representative from the National Confectioners Association, stated, [...] "We're happy to provide candy if there are [...] members...It would be difficult for us to do now." [...] These issues were worked around by asking many small, local, Wyoming confectionery businesses and chocolatiers to give small amounts of candy that were rotated {{in and out of the}} desk.|$|E
