40|$|The report {{presents}} {{results from}} {{a study on the}} role municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs) have as entrance routes for microplastics and other <b>microlitter</b> particles to the marine environment. <b>Microlitter</b> concentrations were analysed in waste water before and after treatment in the STPs, and in the recipient waters where the treated waste water is discharged. Municipal waste water was found to contain a substantial amount of <b>microlitter,</b> but in STPs equipped with chemical and biological treatment most of the litter particles were retained in the sewage sludge. This reduces the impact on the recipient water, but if the sludge is used as fertilizer on farm land the <b>microlitter</b> will still reach the environment. Efforts to reduce the <b>microlitter</b> concentrations should therefore preferably be done in households and other locations where the waste water is originally being formed...|$|E
40|$|The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) {{requires}} European Member States (MS) {{to develop}} strategies that {{should lead to}} programmes of measures that achieve or maintain Good Environmental Status (GES) in European Seas. As an essential step reaching good environmental status, MS should establish monitoring programmes for assessment, enabling {{the state of the}} marine waters concerned to be evaluated on a regular basis. As a follow up to the Commission Decision on criteria and methodological standards on good environmental status (GES) of marine waters (Commission Decision 2010 / 477 /EU), the Marine Directors requested the Directorate-General for the Environment (DG ENV) in 2010 to establish a Technical Subgroup (TSG) under the Working Group on Good Environmental Status (WG GES) for further development of Descriptor 10 Marine Litter (TSG-ML). TSG-ML in 2011 focused on providing advise through the EU Report 25009 “Marine Litter – Technical Recommendations for the implementation of MSFD requirements”. Within that report the options and available tools for the monitoring of marine litter in the different environmental compartments have been identified. Member States have then requested a follow-up through an additional mandate. One scope of this work is to provide harmonized protocols for the monitoring of marine litter for the European Seas. The present document is the Monitoring Guidance for Marine Litter in European Seas (Draft Report) and provides MS with the recommendations and information needed to commence the monitoring required this aspect of MSFD. This draft report divided in 8 sections/chapters presents a general overview of approaches and strategies dealing with marine litter monitoring and provides protocols for the monitoring of specifically: beach litter, floating litter, seafloor litter, litter in biota, <b>microlitter.</b> It concludes by presenting an introduction to a Master List of all litter items for use in litter monitoring programmes in the European marine environment.

40|$|Litterfall in a mixed conifer-angiosperm {{temperate}} forest in northern New Zealand was traced for 5 years {{to determine the}} patterns of litter production and turnover for conifer and angiosperm components of the forest. Basal area and above-ground biomass was shared approximately equally between conifer (mostly Agathis australis; New Zealand kauri) and angiosperm species (plus tree ferns). The five-year mean annual litterfall, excluding macrolitter, was 7. 76 ± 0. 39 (SEM) t ha- 1 and ranged from 6. 77 ± 0. 70 t ha- 1 in 1983 - 4 to 8. 79 ± 1. 00 t ha- 1 in 1987 - 8. Mean monthly litterfall showed a strong seasonal pattern with low rates in winter and early spring, increasing to a peak in early autumn. There were major differences in the nature and timing of litterfall between the conifer and angiosperm fractions. Angiosperm leaf litter reached a maximum in early summer, while conifer litterfall showed highest rates for leaves, twigs and cone scales in late summer-autumn. Conifer reproductive structures (strobili and cone scales) contributed from 13 to 21 % of total litterfall, a value high relative to other {{temperate forest}}s. However, conifer leaf turnover was low relative to that for the angiosperms. Size of the <b>microlitter</b> store was 16. 16 ± 1. 97 t ha- 1 prior to conifer cone fall, and 18. 70 ± 2. 02 t ha- 1 following it, and conifer litter made up 76 - 78 % of the total litter store. The estimated mean annual decomposition constant, k, was 0. 39 overall, 0. 33 for conifer leaf litter and 0. 71 for angiosperm leaf litter, values which agree well with previously published rates for decomposition in this forest stand. Differences in the costs of biomass production and rates of turnover, as measured by litterfall and decomposition, may help to explain the functional coexistence of conifers and angiosperms in mixed forests...|$|E
40|$|Background: Due to {{the wide}} spread of Aspergillus flavus {{contamination}} on the food stuff, its complete growth inhibition is inevitable. Aloe vera has anti-microbial compounds that have significant antifungal and antibacterial activities. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the antifungal activity of acetonic, ethanolic and aqueous extracts of Aloe vera on A. flavus growth and aflatoxin B 1 production. Materials and Methods: In this study, the antifungal activity of acetonic, ethanolic, and aqueous extracts of Aloe vera was evaluated using the agar plate diffusion method. Extracts were tested at different concentrations (0, 102, 103, 104 and 105 microliters /liter). To evaluate the effect of the extract on aflatoxin B 1 production, the acetonic extract of Aloe vera was used and the amount of toxin produced was measured using the HPLC method. Results: The maximum antifungal activity (100) was observed in 105 microliters /liter of acetonic extract. The inhibition percentages of aflatoxin B 1 production at 2, 000 and 2 <b>microlitters</b> /liter concentrations in 50 ml of culture medium were 40. 94 and 18. 14, respectively. Conclusion: The acetonic extract of Aloe vera can be more effective than the other solvents to prevent A. flavus growth and it can also reduce the production of aflatoxin B 1 by A. flavus...|$|R
40|$|Artritis is an {{inflammatory}} condition that affects synovial articulations. The most relevant manifestations are decreased pain threshold and edema. A possible alternative as adjuvant therapy to this disease is {{the inclusion of}} nutraceutics in the diet. In the present study preconditioning with mixes of oils omega 3, 6 and 9 was used at an experimental model of acute artritis induced by zymosan (Zy) in rats. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the antiinflammatory and antinociceptive effects of these mixes which contain high omega- 9 :omega- 6 ratio (3. 4 : 1) and low omega- 6 :omega- 3 ratio (1. 4 : 1). These oil mixes contained different sources of omega- 3 : Mix 1 with alfa-linolenic acid, Mix 2 with alfa-linolenic, eicosapentanoic and docosaexanoic acids, and Mix 3 with alfa-linolenic and docosaexanoic acids. The monoinsaturated omega- 9 fatty acids present antioxidant action whereas the poliinsaturated fatty acids omega- 3 present antiinflammatory effects and the omega- 6 fatty acids are proinflammatory. Thirty male wistar rats weighing 180 - 200 g were used, for each experimental group. The animals were randomly distributed in two groups: Control (= 12) and Test (n= 18). The Control group was subdivided into groups: Negative Control whose animals received water orogastrically during 7 days (n= 6), and Positive Controls whose animals received no oil mixes during 7 days but were treated with either dexametazone (DEXA â n= 6) at the experiment day (day 8). The Test group was distributed into three groups of 6 rats subjected to orgastric administration of mixes 1, 2 and 3. On day 8 all animals had artritis induction by intraarticular injection of zymosan (1 mg/ 50 <b>microlitters)</b> in the right knee. Analised variables were articular incapacitation (A. I.), leucocyte migration, mieloperoxidase (MPO) activity, articular edema, vascular permeability, articular capsule immunostain for iNOS and NF-kB and histopathological analysis. Hypernociception was induced by carrageenan and PGE 2. Results demonstrated a significant decrease (p< 0. 05) in A. I. during the third hour in animals preconditioned with mixes 1, 2 and 3, to level similar to that of those treated with DEXA. As concerned to leucocyte migration, there was a significant reduction (p< 0. 05) in the number of leucocytes in the aticular wash in rats preconditioned with all three mixes, as well as decreased activity of MPO (p< 0. 05) similar to what was found in animals treated with DEXA. Edema was inhibited and vascular permeability diminished in all groups preconditioned with all mixes (p< 0. 05). In animals of Mix 3 the decrease in vascular permeability was even more pronounced as compared to all other groups (p< 0. 001). Histopathology analysis showed a decrease in cellular inflitration and prevention from loss of articular capsule integrity in rats preconditioned with mixes 1 and 2. Immunohistochemical stain for iNOS and NFkB was significantly smaller in rats of groups 1, 2 and 3, similar to that of DEXA group. All oil mixes showed a significant inhibitory effect (p< 0. 05) as concerned to antinociception through the use of a model of plantar mecanic hiperalgia induced by carrageenan, similar to that of rats of INDO group, a drug used in the positive control. On the other hand, the same did not occur when hiperalgia was induced by PGE 2. The results therefore suggest that preconditioning with mixes 1, 2 and 3 present antiinflammatory and antinociceptive effects, as well as decreases synovial expression of iNOS and NFkB. However, the observed antinociceptive effect appears to be indirect and due to the antiinflammatory effect. A artrite Ã uma condiÃÃo inflamatÃria que afeta as articulaÃÃes sinoviais. Os sintomas mais relevantes sÃo aumento da sensibilidade Ã dor nas articulaÃÃes e edema. Uma possÃvel alternativa para o tratamento adjuvante da doenÃa Ã a inclusÃo de nutracÃuticos na dieta oral. No presente estudo foi realizado o prÃ-condicionamento com misturas de Ãleos Ãmega 3, 6 e 9 em um modelo experimental de artrite aguda em ratos por zymosan (Zy). O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar os efeitos anti-inflamatÃrio e antinociceptivo das misturas (MIX) de Ãleos, contendo elevada relaÃÃo - 9 /- 6 (3, 4 : 1) e baixa relaÃÃo - 6 /- 3 (1, 4 : 1) na artrite por Zy. As misturas oleosas continham diferentes fontes de - 3 : MIX- 1, contendo o Ãcido -linolÃnico; MIX- 2, os Ãcidos -linolÃnico, eicosapentaenÃico e docosaexaenÃico, e o MIX- 3, os Ãcidos - linolÃnico e docosaexaenÃico. Os Ãcidos graxos monoinsaturados - 9 tÃm aÃÃo antioxidante, os poliinsaturados - 3 possuem aÃÃo anti-inflamatÃria, enquanto os - 6 sÃo prÃinflamatÃrios. Foram utilizados 30 ratos Wistar machos com peso mÃdio corporal de 180 - 200 gramas, para cada grupo experimental. Os animais foram distribuÃdos, aleatoriamente, em dois grupos: o Controle (n= 12) e o Teste (n= 18). O grupo controle foi subdividido em dois grupos: Controle negativo cujos animais receberam Ãgua, por via orogÃstrica, durante 7 dias (n= 6). Controle positivo, cujos animais nÃo receberam nenhum dos MIX, durante esses sete dias e foram tratados com dexametasona (DEXA- n= 6) no dia do experimento (dia 8). O grupo Teste foi subdividido em trÃs grupos de 6 animais submetidos Ã administraÃÃo orogÃstrica de MIX- 1, MIX- 2 e MIX- 3, respectivamente. No 8 o dia, em todos os grupos (Controle e Teste) foi induzida a artrite por meio de uma injeÃÃo intrarticular (i. a.) de zymosan (1 mg/ 50 &# 956;L) no joelho direito. As variÃveis avaliadas foram: a incapacitaÃÃo articular (I. A.), migraÃÃo de leucÃcitos, atividade de mieloperoxidase (MPO), edema articular, permeabilidade vascular, imunomarcaÃÃo de iNOS e NF-kB e anÃlise histopatolÃgica. Ainda foram realizados os testes de hipernocicepÃÃo induzida por carragenina e PGE 2. Os resultados demonstraram uma diminuiÃÃo significante (p< 0, 05), durante a 3 Â hora da I. A. (pico de incapacitaÃÃo) de todos os grupos prÃ-condicionados com as misturas (MIX- 1, 2 e 3) Ã semelhanÃa do controle positivo por DEXA. Em relaÃÃo Ã migraÃÃo de leucÃcitos para o lÃquido sinovial, todos os grupos prÃ-condicionados com (MIX- 1, 2, e 3) apresentaram significante reduÃÃo da migraÃÃo (p< 0, 05) acompanhado da diminuiÃÃo do nÃmero de neutrÃfilos e da atividade da MPO (p< 0, 05) Ã semelhanÃa do grupo tratado com DEXA. O edema foi inibido (p< 0, 05) assim como, tambÃm, houve uma reduÃÃo da permeabilidade vascular em todos os grupos prÃ-condicionados com diferenÃas significantes (p< 0, 05), sendo o efeito maior do MIX- 3 (p< 0, 001) em relaÃÃo aos outros. A anÃlise histopatolÃgica demonstrou uma diminuiÃÃo do infiltrado celular e prevenÃÃo da perda da integridade da cÃpsula articular de forma significante (p< 0, 05) para os MIX- 1 e 2. A marcaÃÃo para iNOS e NF-kB mostrou uma diminuiÃÃo nos grupos MIX- 1, 2 e 3, igualmente como no grupo da DEXA. Na anÃlise do efeito antinociceptivo no modelo de hiperalgesia mecÃnica plantar induzido por carragenina, todos os MIX demonstraram efeito inibitÃrio significante (p< 0, 05), assim como a indometacina, fÃrmaco usado no controle positivo. Entretanto, isso nÃo foi observado na hiperalgesia induzida por PGE 2. Os resultados sugerem que o prÃcondicionamento com os MIX- 1, 2 e 3 possuem efeitos antinociceptivos e anti-inflamatÃrios, diminuindo, tambÃm, a expressÃo de iNOS e NF-kB no tecido sinovial. PorÃm, o efeito antinociceptivo parece ser indireto e decorrente do seu efeito anti-inflamatÃrio...|$|R
