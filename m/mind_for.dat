5|$|Development of Life Is Strange {{began in}} April 2013. It was formed with an episodic format in <b>mind,</b> <b>for</b> reasons both {{financial}} and creative. The developers conducted field {{research on the}} setting by travelling to the Pacific Northwest, and subverted known archetypes to make the characters. Player feedback influenced the adjustments made to the episodes. Story and character arc serve as the central point in the game rather than traditional graphic adventure tropes like point-and-click puzzles. The voice recording sessions took place in Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the success}} of his film Jeans (1998), S. Shankar wrote a script for his next film titled Mudhalvan (1999) having Rajinikanth in <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> the lead role. However, Rajinikanth could not act in the film due to {{schedule}} conflicts with Padayappa (1999). Hence the role went to Arjun Sarja.

5|$|Other {{issues in}} {{philosophy}} of psychology are philosophical {{questions about the}} nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of cognitive science, or philosophy of <b>mind.</b> <b>For</b> example, are humans rational creatures? Is there any sense in which they have free will, and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and artificial intelligence, questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing at {{an early}} age that he had an incisive <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> politics, Marcas had allied himself with an unnamed man of some fame who lacked wisdom and insight.

Once his {{associate}} had ascended into office, however, he abandoned Marcas, then hired and abandoned him again. Marcas was left poor and unknown, resigned to duplicate the writing of others for very little pay.|$|E

5|$|The idea of To {{directing}} an English-language film {{originated with}} ARP co-founders Michèle and Laurent Pétin, who had Alain Delon in <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> the lead role.

Principal photography began in November 2008, and concluded in February 2009; filming took place on locations in Hong Kong and Macau, with a crew mainly based in Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|The success {{achieved}} by Operation Badr surprised Egyptian commanders, whose confidence soared. Sadat came {{under pressure to}} press the offensive towards the Sinai Passes, but remained unyielding, holding to the original goal of waging a limited war. Ahmed Ismail and Shazly were also on par with Sadat's opinion. However, appeals from the Syrians, whose situation was desperate by October 9, ultimately forced Sadat to change his <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> political reasons, against the protests of his commanders. Consequently, Egypt would lose the initiative to Israel when it launched its unsuccessful attack eastwards on October 14.|$|E

5|$|Anton Rubinstein was {{a famous}} Russian pianist who had lived, {{performed}} and composed in Western and Central Europe before he returned to Russia in 1858. He saw Russia as a musical desert compared to Paris, Berlin and Leipzig, whose music conservatories he had visited. Musical life flourished in those places; composers were held in high regard, and musicians were wholeheartedly devoted to their art. With a similar ideal in <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> Russia, he had conceived {{an idea for a}} conservatory in Russia years before his 1858 return, and had finally aroused the interest of influential people to help him realize the idea.|$|E
5|$|Behaviorism {{dominated}} {{philosophy of}} <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> {{much of the}} 20th century, especially the first half. In psychology, behaviorism developed {{as a reaction to}} the inadequacies of introspectionism. Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations. Without generalizability and the possibility of third-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be scientific. The way out, therefore, was to eliminate the idea of an interior mental life (and hence an ontologically independent mind) altogether and focus instead on the description of observable behavior.|$|E
5|$|Having {{resolved}} {{the issue of}} his playing future, Miller was back in a good frame of <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> the Fourth Test in Adelaide. In a high-scoring match, Miller took a wicket in each innings, but he shone with the bat. England batted first and had reached a strong position of 4/320 {{on the second day}} when Miller bowled Joe Hardstaff junior, who edged a bouncer into his stumps for 67, ending a partnership of 118 with centurion Compton; the hosts lost wickets steadily thereafter to be dismissed for 460, and Miller ended with 1/45 from 16 overs in extreme heat. After Morris and Hassett put on 179 runs for the third wicket, Miller came in at 3/207 late on the third day and reached 33 by the time stumps were drawn with Australia at 4/293, while his partner Johnson was unbeaten on 35.|$|E

5|$|Himmler {{discussed}} {{plans with}} his subordinates to integrate {{at least the}} German-speaking parts of Switzerland completely {{with the rest of}} Germany, and had several persons in <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> the post of a Reichskommissar for the 're-union' of Switzerland with the German Reich (in analogy to the office that Josef Bürckel held after Austria's absorption into Germany during the Anschluss). Later this official was to subsequently become the new Reichsstatthalter of the area after completing its total assimilation. In August 1940, Gauleiter of Westfalen-South Josef Wagner and the Minister President of Baden Walter Köhler spoke in favor of the amalgamation of Switzerland to Reichsgau Burgund (see below) and suggested that the seat of government for this new administrative territory should be the dormant Palais des Nations in Geneva.|$|E

Rama Rao was eventually signed {{as a part of}} his four-film contract with Vijaya Vauhini Studios after Venkata Reddy was impressed with Rama Rao when he met him on the sets of Samsaram (1950). With this film, Rama Rao became the first actor to have acted in two languages simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Many Belgians {{were highly}} {{critical}} of the magazine due to its connections with Hergé, who was still deemed a collaborator and traitor by many; La Soir and La Cité publicly criticised the decision without referring to him by name while Le Quotidien and Le Drapeau Rouge specifically singled him out for denunciation. Hergé believed that the children's author Jeanne Cappe was behind many of these accusations, and threatened her with a lawsuit. Unhappy with life in Belgium, Hergé made plans to emigrate to Argentina, a nation that was welcoming many Europeans who had supported the defeated Axis powers and which had a thriving comic book scene. Ultimately, he changed his <b>mind,</b> <b>for</b> reasons that have remained unknown; it is possible that he was unable to secure any promise of work in the South American country.|$|E

60|$|Thus {{although}} {{truth and}} falsehood are properties of beliefs, {{yet they are}} in a sense extrinsic properties, for the condition of the truth of a belief is something not involving beliefs, or (in general) any mind at all, but only the objects of the belief. A mind, which believes, believes truly when there is a corresponding complex not involving the mind, but only its objects. This correspondence ensures truth, and its absence entails falsehood. Hence we account simultaneously for the two facts that beliefs (a) depend on <b>minds</b> <b>for</b> their existence, (b) do not depend on <b>minds</b> <b>for</b> their truth.|$|R
