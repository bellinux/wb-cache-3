5|$|Manchester United's {{opponents in}} the fourth round was Middlesbrough. Rooney scored twice in the team's 3–0 victory – he lobbed the ball over goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer for his first goal and volleyed it for his second. Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren {{credited}} Rooney's performance afterwards and said he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in the tie. Everton hosted Manchester United in the next round at Goodison Park. A goal apiece from Quinton Fortune and Ronaldo in either half ensured a 2–0 win.|$|E
5|$|Riegels did play, and {{he turned}} in a stellar second half performance, {{including}} blocking a Tech punt. In addition, Lom passed for a touchdown and kicked the extra point, {{but that was not}} enough. Tech would ultimately win the game and their second national championship 8–7. Georgia Tech's safety score after the wrong way run <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in the outcome of the game, which increased the significance of Roy's mistake. In spite of the loss, the example of how the distraught Riegels was persuaded to pick himself up, return to the field and play so hard during the second half is sometimes used by motivational speakers to illustrate overcoming setbacks.|$|E
5|$|After the election, {{many analysts}} {{concluded}} {{that it was the}} unity of the opposition parties against Congress, missing in the 1962 elections, that <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference.</b> The victory is attributed to the electoral alliance between DMK and Rajaji. Even though Congress had done an effective job of managing the state of Madras, the effective grass roots campaigning by the DMK and the political acumen of Annadurai, defeated the Congress and its leader M. Bhaktavatsalam. The popularity of the United Front was so large {{that they were able to}} win an absolute majority in ten out of the 14 districts in the state, while Congress could not accomplish that in a single district. This was largely due to the fact that the United Front was able to capitalize on its growing support in large towns and cities, combined with the decline in Congress support in its traditional Schedule Caste constituencies.|$|E

5|$|At the 1968 Republican National Convention, Agnew, who {{had earlier}} {{been asked to}} place Richard Nixon's name in nomination, was {{selected}} as running mate by Nixon and his campaign staff. Agnew's centrist reputation interested Nixon, and the law and order stance he had taken {{in the wake of}} civil unrest that year appealed to aides such as Pat Buchanan. Agnew made a number of gaffes during the campaign, but his rhetoric pleased many Republicans, and he may have <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in several key states. Nixon and Agnew defeated the Democratic ticket, incumbent vice president, Hubert Humphrey for president, and his running mate, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie. As vice president, Agnew was often called upon to attack the administration's enemies. In the years of his vice presidency, Agnew moved to the right, appealing to conservatives who were suspicious of moderate stances taken by Nixon. In 1972, Nixon and Agnew were reelected for a second term, defeating Senator George McGovern of South Dakota and former ambassador Sargent Shriver of Maryland.|$|E

25|$|Bellone had 34 guns, {{including}} 24 long 8-pounder guns, {{and though}} she had more guns, her broadside was inferior to that on Lord Nelson. What <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> was that Bellone had a crew of 260 men, versus the 102 men, exclusive of passengers, on Lord Nelson. However, Bellone also had on board some 56 prisoners from various captures.|$|E
25|$|Polls in June 2013 also {{supported}} {{the conclusion that}} the division of opinion between acceptance and rejection of same-sex marriage is in about equal halves. When the distinction between same-sex unions that are not termed marriages in relation to same-sex marriage is <b>made,</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in the numbers of approval and disapproval is still insignificant, below 1%; the most frequent reason for disapproval is a supposed 'unnaturalness' of same-sex relationships, followed by religious beliefs.|$|E

However, on 1 June 2010, it {{was announced}} that Walcott had been left out of England's 23-man World Cup squad by Fabio Capello. On 4 July, a few days after England's exit from the World Cup, Lionel Messi said that he was shocked by Walcott's exclusion as he believed that Walcott could have <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> against Germany and Algeria. In January 2011, Capello admitted that he had made a mistake in not selecting Walcott for the 2010 World Cup.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to previous criticisms {{that there had}} been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of the war Churchill created and took the additional position of Minister of Defence, making him the most powerful wartime prime minister in British history. He immediately put his friend and confidant, industrialist and newspaper baron Lord Beaverbrook, in charge of aircraft production and made his friend Frederick Lindemann the government's scientific advisor. It was Beaverbrook's business acumen that allowed Britain to quickly gear up aircraft production and engineering, which eventually <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in the war.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} of the three Confederate attacks, around 10 a.m., Walker's Stonewall Brigade and Daniel's North Carolina brigade {{assaulted}} Greene from the east, while Steuart's brigade advanced over the open field toward the main hill against the brigades of Candy and Kane, which did not have the advantage of strong breastworks to fight behind. Nevertheless, both attacks were beaten back with heavy losses. The attacks against the heights were again fruitless, and superior use of artillery on the open fields to the south <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> there.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, the 19th {{century was}} a great age of {{nationalism}} and there was tendency by historians in the Allied nations to give the lion's share {{of the credit for}} defeating France to their own respective nation with British historians claiming that it was the United Kingdom that played the most important role in defeating Napoleon; Austrian historians giving that honor to their nation; Russian historians writing that it was Russia that played the greatest role in the victory; and Prussian and later German historians writing that it was Prussia that <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference.</b> In such a context, various historians liked to diminish the contributions of their allies.|$|E

25|$|Worrell did, however, {{serve as}} the team manager when West Indies hosted Australia in 1964–65. The matches against Australia were bitterly fought, with accusations about Charlie Griffith's action (he was accused of throwing, which is banned in the laws of cricket) and bouncer wars. The West Indies won this series 2–1 to be the {{unofficial}} world champions. Sobers was not as good at man-management as Worrell and cracks soon began to appear. Often it was his individual brilliance that <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between a win and a loss. Throughout the 1960s, West Indies bowling was led by Wes Hall, Griffith, Lance Gibbs and Sobers himself. Hall and Griffith faded and then retired {{by the end of}} the decade, but WI could find no replacement for them till the mid-1970s.|$|E
25|$|Catcher Christian Vazquez {{returned}} to the Red Sox lineup {{for the first time}} since 2014 after undergoing Tommy John surgery, going 2-for-4 and making some great defensive plays. Travis Shaw's 2 2-out RBI <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> as the Sox backed Porcello for a win. David Price earned his first home win the next day after his solid pitching was supported by Xander Bogaerts's 3-run home run. But much like the previous weekend, the Sox dropped the third game of the series after the offense went cold to give Steven Wright another loss despite only giving up 2 runs in 6 innings. On Patriots' Day, Clay Buchholz had one of his best career outings, but it was spoiled after Koji Uehara and the bullpen combined to give up 4 runs in the eighth.|$|E

Finally, in Game 4, Jon Lester took Tim Wakefield's spot in the rotation and gave the Sox an impressive start, pitching 5⅔ shutout innings. The Rockies threatened, but thanks to World Series MVP Mike Lowell and aided by a pinch-hit home run by outfielder Bobby Kielty, Papelbon registered another save as the Red Sox swept the Rockies in four games.
