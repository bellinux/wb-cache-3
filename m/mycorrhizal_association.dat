5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>association</b> with willow trees, {{and it is}} for this that the species is named. However, {{particular}} species favoured by the fungus are unclear and may include beech and alder taxa. The mushrooms grow from the ground, often among mosses or detritus. I.saliceticola was first described in 2009, and within the genus Inocybe, the species {{is a part of the}} section Marginatae. The species has been recorded in Finland and Sweden and is relatively common in some areas.|$|E
5|$|Some trees {{such as the}} alders (Alnus species) have a {{symbiotic}} relationship with Frankia species, a filamentous bacterium that can fix nitrogen from the air, converting it into ammonia. They have actinorhizal root nodules on their roots in which the bacteria live. This process enables the tree to live in low nitrogen habitats where they would otherwise be unable to thrive. The plant hormones called cytokinins initiate root nodule formation, in a process closely related to <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>association.</b>|$|E
5|$|Suillus spraguei {{grows in}} a <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>association</b> with several pine species, {{particularly}} eastern white pine, and the fruit bodies grow on the ground, appearing from early summer to autumn. It has a disjunct distribution, and is found in eastern Asia, northeastern North America, and Mexico throughout {{the range of the}} host tree. The mushroom is edible, although opinions about its quality vary. The mushroom bears a resemblance to several other Suillus species, including the closely related S.decipiens, although the species can be differentiated by variations in color and size.|$|E

5|$|Widely {{distributed}} in the Northern Hemisphere, Tricholoma vaccinum is found in northern Asia, Europe and North America. The fungus grows in a <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>association</b> with spruce or pine trees, and its mushrooms are found on the ground growing in groups or clusters in late summer and autumn. Although some consider the mushroom edible, it is of poor quality and not recommended for consumption. The ectomycorrhizae of T.vaccinum {{has been the subject}} of considerable research.|$|E
5|$|Harrya chromapes, {{commonly}} known as the yellowfoot bolete or the chrome-footed bolete, is species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. The bolete is found in eastern North America, Costa Rica, and eastern Asia, where it grows on the ground, in a <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>association</b> with deciduous and coniferous trees. Fruit bodies have smooth, rose-pink caps that are initially convex before flattening out. The pores on the cap undersurface are white, aging to a pale pink as the spores mature. The thick stipe has fine pink or reddish dots (scabers), and is white to pinkish but with a bright yellow base. The mushrooms are edible but are popular with insects, and so they are often infested with maggots.|$|E
5|$|Boletus rubroflammeus is {{a species}} of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. First {{described}} from Michigan in 1971, it {{is found in the}} eastern United States and Mexico, where it grows in a <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>association</b> with hardwood trees. The fruit bodies (mushrooms) of the fungus have caps that are deep red to purplish red, and dark red pores. The stem has coarse, dark red reticulations (raised, net-like ridges) and a narrow yellow area at the top. All parts of the mushroom quickly stain blue when injured or cut. Lookalikes include Boletus flammans, a lighter-colored species that grows with conifers. Other similar species can be distinguished by differences in distribution, morphology, staining reaction, and microscopic characteristics. Boletus rubroflammeus mushrooms are poisonous, and can cause gastrointestinal distress if consumed.|$|E

5|$|Bothia is a fungal genus in {{the family}} Boletaceae. A {{monotypic}} genus, it contains the single species Bothia castanella, a bolete mushroom first described scientifically in 1900 from collections made in New Jersey. Found in the eastern United States, Costa Rica, China, and Taiwan, it grows in a <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>association</b> with oak trees. Its fruit body is chestnut brown, the cap is smooth and dry, and {{the underside of the}} cap has radially elongated tubes. The spore deposit is yellow-brown. The edibility of the mushroom is unknown. Historically, its unique combination of morphological features resulted in the transfer of B.castanella to six different Boletaceae genera. Molecular phylogenetic analysis, published in 2007, demonstrated that the species was genetically unique enough to warrant placement in its own genus.|$|E
5|$|The genus, {{with about}} 20 {{described}} species, has a distribution that includes to Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and New Zealand. About {{half of the}} species {{are found in the}} southeastern United States, including three species added to the genus in 2013–14. Several Phellodon species were placed on a preliminary Red List of threatened British fungi because of a general decline of the genus in Europe. Species grow in a symbiotic <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>association</b> with trees from the families Fagaceae (beeches and oaks) and Pinaceae (pines). Accurate DNA-based methods have been developed to determine the presence of Phellodon species in the soil, even in the extended absence of visible fruitbodies. Although Phellodon fruitbodies are considered inedible due to their fibrous flesh, the type species, P.niger, is used in mushroom dyeing.|$|E
5|$|The {{occurrence}} of Boletopsis nothofagi {{seems to be}} strongly connected to the {{occurrence of}} the southern beech Nothofagus fusca, a species of Fagales that is endemic to New Zealand. B.nothofagi has been found exclusively in N.fusca forests spread through New Zealand below 37° S. The fungus forms a <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>association</b> with the trees of N.fusca, in which the hyphae of the fungal mycelium wrap around {{the roots of the}} tree and penetrate the cortex, but not its cells. Subsequently, B.nothofagi takes over the function of the root hair and directs water and soil nutrients to the tree. In return, the fungus can, through contact with the root tissue, access the products of the tree's photosynthesis. The fruit bodies of the species have so far always been found in May, the end of autumn in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E

30|$|Seed and {{protocorm}} {{development is}} reviewed {{in this issue}} by Yeung (2017), including discussion of <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>associations</b> and the survival of orchid seeds and plantlets in their natural habitats. Clearly, the role of mycorrhizal fungi {{is crucial to the}} survival of self-sustaining populations of orchids, but there is much research still to be conducted before we fully understand the <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>associations,</b> especially with epiphytic orchid species. Even with temperate terrestrial species, the processes involved are not fully understood, but techniques including measurement of isotope enrichment of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen now allow us to demonstrate the contribution that the fungi make to the nutrition of orchids, even when the plants are apparently capable of photosynthesis (e.g. Gebauer et al. 2016). These techniques were recently used, for example, by Fay et al. (2018) to demonstrate that reintroduced seedlings of Cypripedium calceolus had established <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>associations</b> after planting out, despite being produced axenically.|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{suggest that}} biomass-derived black carbon (biochar) affects {{microbial}} populations and soil biogeochemistry. Both biochar and <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>associations,</b> ubiquitous symbioses in terrestrial ecosystems, are potentially important in various ecosystem {{services provided by}} soils, contributing to sustainable plant production, ecosystem restoration, and soil carbon sequestration and hence mitigation of global climate change. As both biochar and <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>associations</b> are subject to management, understanding and exploiting interactions between them could be advantageous. Here we focus on biochar effects on <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>associations.</b> After reviewing the experimental evidence for such effects, we critically examine hypotheses pertaining to four mechanisms by which biochar could influence mycorrhizal abundance and/or functioning. These mechanisms are (in decreasing order of currently available evidence supporting them) : (a) alteration of soil physico-chemical properties; (b) indirect effects on mycorrhizae through effects on other soil microbes; (c) plant¿fungus signaling interference and detoxification of allelochemicals on biochar; and (d) provision of refugia from fungal grazers. We provide a roadmap for research aimed at testing these mechanistic hypotheses...|$|R
5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} a <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>association</b> with willow (Salix). Precise favoured species are unclear; {{at least one of}} the tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia) or the dark-leaved willow (S.myrsinifolia) is a {{possible}} symbiont, while other trees that the species has been found near include the bay willow (S.pentandra), the grey willow (S.cinnerea), the grey alder (Alnus incana) and species of birch (Betula). I.saliceticola is found most typically in moist thickets or woodland close to shores, but recordings have also been made in other moist habitats. Mushrooms are encountered on the ground, growing from detritus or amongst moss, such as the heart-leaved spear-moss (Calliergon cordifolium), the spiky-bog moss (Sphagnum squarrosum) and species of Mnium. They are typically near plants such as the tufted loosestrife (Lysimachia thyrsiflora), the creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens), the common marsh-bedstraw (Galium palustre), the purple marshlocks (Comarum palustre) and the purple small-reed (Calamagrostis canescens), and share the habitat with other Inocybe, including I.acuta and I.laceravar.helobia.|$|E
5|$|Mushrooms {{are mostly}} found during hot spells {{in summer and}} autumn, growing in <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>association</b> with various {{broad-leaved}} trees and sclerophyllous shrubs, especially oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus), chestnut (Castanea), strawberry trees (Arbutus), treeheath (Erica), and rockrose (Cistus), showing a preference for acid soils. Roadsides and parks are common habitats. The cork oak in particular is an important symbiont, {{and the distribution of}} B.aereus (along with B.mamorensis) aligns with the tree across Europe and North Africa. The ectomycorrhizae that B.aereus forms with sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) and downy oak (Quercus pubescens) have been described in detail. They are characterized by a lack of hyphal clamps, a plectenchymatous mantle (made of parallel-orientated hyphae with little branching or overlap), and rhizomorphs with differentiated hyphae. A 2007 field study on four species of boletes revealed little correlation between the abundance of fruit bodies and presence of its mycelia below ground, even when soil samples were taken from directly beneath the mushroom; the study concluded that the triggers leading to formation of mycorrhizae and production of the fruit bodies appear to be more complex than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Suillus americanus is {{a species}} of fungus in the Suillaceae family of mushrooms. Commonly known as the chicken fat mushroom, the American {{slippery}} Jack (or slipperycap), or the American suillus, it grows in a <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>association</b> with eastern white pine {{and can be found}} where this tree occurs in eastern North America and China. The mushroom can be recognized by the bright yellow cap with red to reddish-brown scales embedded in slime, the large yellow angular pores {{on the underside of the}} cap, and the narrow yellow stem marked with dark reddish dots. Molecular phylogenetics analysis suggests that S.americanus may be the same species as S.sibiricus, found in western North America and western and central Asia. Suillus americanus is edible, although opinions vary as to its palatability; some susceptible individuals may suffer a contact dermatitis after touching the fruit bodies. The fruit bodies contain a beta glucan carbohydrate shown in laboratory tests to have anti-inflammatory properties.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlmost all land plants form {{symbiotic}} <b>associations</b> with <b>mycorrhizal</b> fungi. These below-ground {{fungi play}} a key role in terrestrial ecosystems as they regulate nutrient and carbon cycles, and influence soil structure and ecosystem multifunctionality. Up to 80 % of plant N and P is provided by mycorrhizal fungi and many plant species depend on these symbionts for growth and survival. Estimates suggest that there are c. 50000 fungal species that form <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>associations</b> with c. 250000 plant species. The development of high-throughput molecular tools has helped us to better understand the biology, evolution, and biodiversity of <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>associations.</b> Nuclear genome assemblies and gene annotations of 33 mycorrhizal fungal species are now available providing fascinating opportunities to deepen our understanding of the mycorrhizal lifestyle, the metabolic capabilities of these plant symbionts, the molecular dialogue between symbionts, and evolutionary adaptations across a range of <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>associations.</b> Large-scale molecular surveys have provided novel insights into the diversity, spatial and temporal dynamics of mycorrhizal fungal communities. At the ecological level, network theory makes it possible to analyze interactions between plant-fungal partners as complex underground multi-species networks. Our analysis suggests that nestedness, modularity and specificity of mycorrhizal networks vary and depend on mycorrhizal type. Mechanistic models explaining partner choice, resource exchange, and coevolution in <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>associations</b> have been developed and are being tested.

5|$|Suillus salmonicolor {{occurs in}} a <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>association</b> with various species of Pinus. This is a mutualistic {{relationship}} in which the subterranean fungal mycelia creates a protective sheath around the rootlets of the tree and a network of hyphae (the Hartig net) that penetrates between the tree's epidermal and cortical cells. This association helps the plant absorb water and mineral nutrients; in exchange, the fungus receives a supply of carbohydrates produced by the plant's photosynthesis. Two-, three-, and five-needled pines have all been recorded to associate with S.salmonicolor. In North America, the fungus has been found growing with P.banksiana, P.palustris, P.resinosa, P.rigida, P.strobus and P.taeda. In Kamchatka (in the Russian Far East) {{it has been found}} in association with P.pumila, in the Philippines with P.kesiya, and in southern India with P.patula. The northern limit of its North American range is eastern Canada (Quebec), and the southern limit is Nuevo León and near Nabogame in Temósachi Municipality, Chihuahua, Mexico.|$|E

50|$|Mycorrhizae {{include a}} broad variety of root-fungi {{interactions}} characterized by mode of colonization. Essentially all plants form <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>associations,</b> {{and there is}} evidence that some mycorrhizae transport carbon and other nutrients not just from soil to plant, but also between different plants in a landscape. The main groups include ectomycorrhizae, arbuscular mycorhizae, ericoid mycorrhizae, orchid mycorrhizae, and monotropoid mycorrhizae. Monotropoid mycorrhizae are associated with plants in the monotropaceae, which lack chlorophyll. Many Orchids are also achlorophyllous for at least part of their life cycle. Thus these mycorrhizal-plant relationships are unique because the fungus provides the host with carbon as well as other nutrients, often by parasitizing other plants. Achlorophyllous plants forming these types of <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>associations</b> are called mycoheterotrophs.|$|R

More than 200 ectomycorrhiza-forming fungal species belonging to 40 genera have been reported so far {{to be associated with}} Cistus. As with many other Cistaceae, the species of Cistus have the ability to form <b>mycorrhizal</b> <b>associations</b> with truffles (Tuber) and are thus able to thrive on poor sandy soils or rocks.
