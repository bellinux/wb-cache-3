50|$|In {{comparison}} to manufacturer <b>merchandisers,</b> retailer <b>merchandisers</b> also begin their process by forecasting industry and fashion trends with their target markets in mind.

Following shipment, ordered seasonal apparel assortments are strategically arranged on sales floors, or visually merchandised.|$|R
