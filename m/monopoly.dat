500|$|Over time, {{this system}} {{became more and}} more problematic; instead of {{temporary}} <b>monopolies</b> on specific, imported industries, long-term <b>monopolies</b> came about over more common commodities, including salt and starch.

Coke succeeded in establishing the Committee of Grievances, a body chaired by him that abolished a large number of <b>monopolies.</b> This was followed by a wave of protest at the patent system. On 27 March 1621, James suggested the House of Commons draw up a list of the three most objectionable patents, and he would remove them, but by this time a statute was already being prepared by Coke.

5|$|Park Lane is {{the second}} most {{valuable}} property in the London edition of the board game <b>Monopoly.</b> The street had a prestigious social status when the British version of the <b>Monopoly</b> board was first produced, in 1936. On the board, Park Lane forms a pair with Mayfair, the most expensive property in the game. The squares were designed to be equivalents of Park Place and Boardwalk, respectively, on the original board, which used streets in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In 1988, the World <b>Monopoly</b> Championships were held at the Park Lane Hotel, sponsored by Waddingtons, manufacturers of the British version. Since the game's original production, prices on the real Park Lane have held their value, though average rent costs have been overtaken by Bond Street.|$|E

Both the cross-section data from Switzerland and the time-series evidence from Germany strongly suggest that in this specific market the presence of state <b>monopolies</b> is very advantageous for the customers. This raises the question why German academic economists made practically no effort to defend their state insurance <b>monopolies</b> in the debate about the 3 rd EU directive on property insurance. Is it possible that peer pressure prevents academic economists from standing up to defend state <b>monopolies,</b> even if these are clearly to the benefit of consumers...|$|R
