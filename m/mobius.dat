5|$|Countless {{results in}} number theory invoke the {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic and the algebraic properties of even numbers, so the above choices have far-reaching consequences. For example, {{the fact that}} positive numbers have unique factorizations means that one can determine whether a number has an even or odd number of distinct prime factors. Since 1 is not prime, nor does it have prime factors, it {{is a product of}} 0 distinct primes; since 0 is an even number, 1 has an even number of distinct prime factors. This implies that the <b>Möbius</b> function takes the value , which is necessary for it to be a multiplicative function and for the <b>Möbius</b> inversion formula to work.|$|E
5|$|An {{official}} 2-CD soundtrack album for the game, <b>Mobius</b> Final Fantasy Original Soundtrack, {{was released}} through Square Enix's music label on February 26, 2015 under the catalog number SQEX-10534-5. The {{music on the}} album covers Chapters 1 to 3. According to Suzuki, {{this was due to}} the music feeling like it had reached a natural transition point by that stage of the game.|$|E
5|$|Circle inversions {{correspond}} to {{a subset of}} <b>Möbius</b> transformations on the Riemann sphere. The planar Apollonius problem can {{be transferred to the}} sphere by an inverse stereographic projection; hence, solutions of the planar Apollonius problem also pertain to its counterpart on the sphere. Other inversive solutions to the planar problem are possible besides the common ones described below.|$|E
5|$|It {{is common}} in {{mathematics}} to regard the Lorentz group to be, foremost, the <b>Möbius</b> group {{to which it is}} isomorphic. The group may be represented in terms of a set of functions defined on the Riemann sphere. These are the Riemann P-functions, which are expressible as hypergeometric functions.|$|E
5|$|The English name Octopus {{card was}} also {{selected}} from the naming competition. Coincidentally, the English name coincides with the number eight in the Chinese name, since an octopus has eight tentacles. The logo used on the card features a <b>Möbius</b> strip {{in the shape of}} an infinity symbol.|$|E
5|$|The Margaret Leggat Butler Library was {{constructed}} in 1930 and {{is located in the}} historic eastern region of campus. In addition to 150,000 books and periodicals, classroom, research, and quiet study spaces, the library also houses a coffee shop and a writing center. The library {{is a member of the}} <b>MOBIUS</b> Consortium, a statewide system that links Lindenwood's library to libraries at other higher learning institutions across Missouri.|$|E
5|$|Arts and {{literary}} publications include The Columbia Review, the nation's oldest college literary magazine; Columbia, a nationally regarded literary journal; the Columbia Journal of Literary Criticism; and The <b>Mobius</b> Strip, an online arts {{and literary}} magazine. Inside New York is an annual guidebook to New York City, written, edited, {{and published by}} Columbia undergraduates. Through a distribution agreement with Columbia University Press, the book is sold at major retailers and independent bookstores.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is {{a falling}} block puzzle video game {{developed}} by Compile {{and published by}} Sega. It was released for the Genesis/Mega Drive in North America and Europe in November 1993, and was ported to the Game Gear and Master System in December 1993 and June 1994, respectively. The plot revolves around Sonic the Hedgehog series antagonist Doctor Robotnik kidnapping residents from Beanville and turning them into robots, {{with the purpose of}} removing all joy from the planet <b>Mobius.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1857, Cayley {{introduced}} matrix notation, {{which allows}} for a harmonization and simplification of linear maps. Around the same time, Grassmann studied the barycentric calculus initiated by <b>Möbius.</b> He envisaged sets of abstract objects endowed with operations. In his work, the concepts of linear independence and dimension, as well as scalar products, are present. In fact, Grassmann's 1844 work exceeds the framework of vector spaces, since his consideration of multiplication led him to what are today called algebras. Peano {{was the first to}} give the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps in 1888.|$|E
5|$|Mathematics has {{directly}} influenced {{art with}} conceptual {{tools such as}} linear perspective, the analysis of symmetry, and mathematical objects such as polyhedra and the <b>Möbius</b> strip. Magnus Wenninger creates colourful stellated polyhedra, originally as models for teaching. Mathematical concepts such as recursion and logical paradox {{can be seen in}} paintings by Rene Magritte and in engravings by M. C. Escher. Computer art often makes use of fractals including the Mandelbrot set, and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as cellular automata. Controversially, the artist David Hockney has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the camera lucida to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that Vermeer used the camera obscura in his distinctively observed paintings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mobius</b> Final Fantasy is a {{role-playing}} game {{designed for}} mobile phones. The player controls the game's protagonist Warrior of Light (Wol) while navigating Palamecia. Players can customize settings, graphical quality, and adjust controls for their dominant hand. During local navigation {{on the field}} map, the player taps a location on a map and the character travels to that location. In some self-contained areas, the player can directly control the character. Along with standard navigation, the player can navigate the game world using a fast-travel system, progressively unlocked as the player progresses through the story. Many of the features in the game, such as the leveling system and exploration, {{are similar to those}} from previous home console Final Fantasy games.|$|E
5|$|Tidus' dialogue, monologues {{and songs}} were {{included}} on the Final Fantasy X Vocal Collection and feel/Go dream: Yuna & Tidus CDs. Although he does not fully understand {{that he is not}} the fayth dream, Tidus feels that disappearing would be preferable to making Yuna cry again. The novel Final Fantasy X-2.5 ~Eien no Daishou~, set after Final Fantasy X-2, explores Tidus and Yuna's visit to Besaid Island 1,000 years before. The HD remastered version of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2, Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster, adds an audio drama (Final Fantasy X: Will) in which Tidus is a new blitzball star who appears to be concealing an injury. After Yuna breaks up with him, Tidus helps her on a quest to defeat a reborn Sin. Tidus' disappearance between Final Fantasy X and its sequel will be explained in the game, <b>Mobius</b> Final Fantasy.|$|E
5|$|Vector spaces {{stem from}} affine {{geometry}} via {{the introduction of}} coordinates in the plane or three-dimensional space. Around 1636, Descartes and Fermat founded analytic geometry by equating solutions to an equation of two variables with points on a plane curve. In 1804, to achieve geometric solutions without using coordinates, Bolzano introduced certain operations on points, lines and planes, which are predecessors of vectors. His work was then used in the conception of barycentric coordinates by <b>Möbius</b> in 1827. In 1828 C. V. Mourey suggested {{the existence of an}} algebra surpassing not only ordinary algebra but also two-dimensional algebra created by him searching a geometrical interpretation of complex numbers.|$|E
5|$|At around 13:00, {{tanks of}} the Panzer-Lehr Division {{advanced}} into Villers-Bocage unsupported by infantry. Four Panzer IVs tried to enter {{from the south}} near a wrecked Panzer IV and two were knocked out by anti-tank fire. Some Tigers were brought up and, in an exchange of fire, silenced the anti-tank position. <b>Möbius</b> divided the primary counter-attack down the main highway through Villers-Bocage and through the southern section of town parallel to the main road, to secure the town centre. The Tigers advanced slowly to intimidate the British into withdrawing {{and ran into the}} British ambush. The Firefly opened fire on the lead tank and missed but the anti-tank gun knocked it out. A group of three Tigers split up and drove through the back streets to flank the British; one was engaged by an anti-tank gun and destroyed, the other two were engaged with PIATs, one was knocked out and the other immobilised.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Toshiyuki Itahana. In common with his typical drawing style for characters, Itahana created Wol to be a heroic fantasy character that both fitted within and did not conform to earlier Final Fantasy titles. He and other designers created the multiple job outfits to further convey the fantasy setting. After its reveal, some changes {{were made to the}} character's initial costume: due to negative player feedback about the amount of skin shown, the Onion Swordsman outfit was adjusted to be more covering. The game's environments were designed by Takako Miyake, who had previously worked on console Final Fantasy titles. She did not change her working style for <b>Mobius</b> Final Fantasy: all the assets were designed in high definition, and only adjusted slightly when they were brought into the mobile environment. The visual effects were handled by company veteran Shintaro Takai, whose main preoccupation was to make sure the game did not slow down during the flashier visual combat effects due to hardware constraints. The cutscenes were not affected by these issues.|$|E
25|$|In graph theory, the <b>Möbius</b> ladder is a cubic graph {{closely related}} to the <b>Möbius</b> strip.|$|E
25|$|The {{projective}} linear groups therefore generalise {{the case}} PGL(2, C) of <b>Möbius</b> transformations (sometimes called the <b>Möbius</b> group), which acts on the projective line.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that there}} are {{precisely}} two matrices with unit determinant {{which can be used}} to represent any given <b>Möbius</b> transformation. That is, SL(2,C) is a double cover of PSL(2,C). Since SL(2,C) is simply-connected it is the universal cover of the <b>Möbius</b> group. Therefore, the fundamental group of the <b>Möbius</b> group is Z2.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{subgroups of}} the <b>Möbius</b> group form the {{automorphism}} {{groups of the}} other simply-connected Riemann surfaces (the complex plane and the hyperbolic plane). As such, <b>Möbius</b> transformations {{play an important role}} in the theory of Riemann surfaces. The fundamental group of every Riemann surface is a discrete subgroup of the <b>Möbius</b> group (see Fuchsian group and Kleinian group).|$|E
25|$|Like the <b>Möbius</b> strip, the Klein bottle is a {{two-dimensional}} manifold {{which is not}} orientable. Unlike the <b>Möbius</b> strip, the Klein bottle is a closed manifold, meaning it is a compact manifold without boundary. While the <b>Möbius</b> strip can be embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space R3, the Klein bottle cannot. It can be embedded in R4, however.|$|E
25|$|The three {{generating}} circles, {{and hence}} the entire construction, {{are determined by the}} location of the three points where they are tangent to one another. Since there is a <b>Möbius</b> transformation which maps any three given points in the plane to any other three points, and since <b>Möbius</b> transformations preserve circles, then there is a <b>Möbius</b> transformation which maps any two Apollonian gaskets to one another.|$|E
25|$|For example, since H1(S1; Z/2Z) = Z/2Z, {{there are}} only two line bundles over the circle up to bundle isomorphism: the trivial one, and the open <b>Möbius</b> strip (i.e., the <b>Möbius</b> strip with its {{boundary}} deleted).|$|E
25|$|As a {{convolution}} operator: Via the formalism of incidence algebras, difference {{operators and}} other <b>Möbius</b> inversion {{can be represented}} by convolution with a function on the poset, called the <b>Möbius</b> function μ; for the difference operator, μ is the sequence (1,1,0,0,0,...).|$|E
25|$|The <b>Möbius</b> transformations are the {{projective}} {{transformations of}} the complex projective line. They form {{a group called the}} <b>Möbius</b> group, which is the projective linear group PGL(2,C). Together with its subgroups, it has numerous applications in mathematics and physics.|$|E
25|$|As seen above, the <b>Möbius</b> group PSL(2,C) acts on Minkowski {{space as}} the group of those isometries that {{preserve}} the origin, the orientation of space and the direction of time. Restricting to the points where Q=1 in the positive light cone, which form a model of hyperbolic 3-space Hnbsp&3, {{we see that the}} <b>Möbius</b> group acts on Hnbsp&3 as a group of orientation-preserving isometries. In fact, the <b>Möbius</b> group is equal to the group of orientation-preserving isometries of hyperbolic 3-space.|$|E
25|$|Thought the <b>Möbius</b> {{band was}} divine.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Möbius</b> ladder M8 has 392 {{spanning}} trees; it and M6 {{have the}} most spanning trees among all cubic graphs with {{the same number of}} vertices. However, the 10-vertex cubic graph with the most spanning trees is the Petersen graph, which is not a <b>Möbius</b> ladder.|$|E
25|$|The {{group of}} <b>Möbius</b> transformations which {{preserve}} cross-ratios.|$|E
25|$|Chaotic attractor, {{significantly}} more <b>Möbius</b> strip-like (folding over itself).|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} nontrivial {{example of}} a vector bundle is the <b>Möbius</b> band (pictured on the right): a strip of paper with a twist in it, which represents a rank 1 vector bundle over a circle (the circle in question being the centerline of the <b>Möbius</b> band). K-theory is a tool for working with higher-dimensional analogues of this example, or in other words for describing higher-dimensional twistings: elements of the K-group of a space are represented by vector bundles over it, so the <b>Möbius</b> band represents {{an element of the}} K-group of a circle.|$|E
25|$|Another {{closely related}} {{manifold}} {{is the real}} projective plane. If a circular disk is {{cut out of the}} real projective plane, what is left is a <b>Möbius</b> strip. Going in the other direction, if one glues a disk to a <b>Möbius</b> strip by identifying their boundaries, the result is the projective plane. To visualize this, it is helpful to deform the <b>Möbius</b> strip so that its boundary is an ordinary circle (see above). The real projective plane, like the Klein bottle, cannot be embedded in three-dimensions without self-intersections.|$|E
25|$|The Euler {{characteristic}} of the <b>Möbius</b> strip is zero.|$|E
25|$|Difference {{operator}} generalizes to <b>Möbius</b> inversion over {{a partially}} ordered set.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Möbius</b> {{transformation}} {{is equivalent to}} a sequence of simpler transformations.|$|E
