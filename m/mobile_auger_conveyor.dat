50|$|A chaser bin, {{also called}} grain cart or (grain) auger wagon, is a trailer towed by a tractor with a {{built-in}} <b>auger</b> <b>conveyor</b> system, usually with a large capacity (from several hundred to over 1000 bushels; around 15 t is average).|$|R
50|$|The <b>mobile</b> <b>auger</b> mixer was {{patented}} in 1964 by hazards Zimmerman, Ephrata, PA USA. Because of the patents, {{there was}} only one equipment manufacturer until the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|A swather may be {{self-propelled}} via {{an internal}} combustion engine, {{or may be}} drawn by a tractor and powered through a power take-off shaft. A swather uses a sickle bar (see mower) to cut the stems of the crop. A reel helps the cut crop fall neatly onto a canvas or <b>auger</b> <b>conveyor</b> which moves it and deposits it into a windrow, with all stems oriented in the same direction. As combines replaced threshing machines, the swather was needed to replace the binder. The mown strip left behind is the swathe.|$|R
5000|$|A screw <b>conveyor</b> or <b>auger</b> <b>conveyor</b> is a {{mechanism}} {{that uses a}} rotating helical screw blade, called a [...] "flighting", usually within a tube, to move liquid or granular materials. They are used in many bulk handling industries. Screw conveyors in modern industry are often used horizontally or at a slight incline as {{an efficient way to}} move semi-solid materials, including food waste, wood chips, aggregates, cereal grains, animal feed, boiler ash, meat and bone meal, municipal solid waste, and many others. The first type of screw conveyor was the Archimedes' screw, used since ancient times to pump irrigation water.|$|R
50|$|Various other {{applications}} of the screw or <b>auger</b> <b>conveyor</b> include its use in snowblowers, to move snow towards an impeller, where it is thrown into the discharge chute. Combine harvesters use both enclosed and open augers to move the unthreshed crop into the threshing mechanism and to move the grain {{into and out of}} the machine's hopper. Ice resurfacers use augers to remove loose ice particles from the surface of the ice. An auger is also a central component of an injection molding machine. An auger is used in some rubbish compactors to push the rubbish into a lowered plate at one end for compaction.|$|R

50|$|In {{agriculture}} and manufacturing, an elevator/lift is {{any type of}} conveyor device used to lift materials in a continuous stream into bins or silos. Several types exist, such as the chain and bucket elevator, grain <b>auger</b> screw <b>conveyor</b> using the principle of Archimedes' screw, or the chain and paddles or forks of hay elevators.|$|R
40|$|A importância da implantação do sistema APPCC/HACCP em moinhos de trigo foi avaliada em três moinhos na regiões sul e sudeste do Brasil, focando o estudo nos aspectos microbiológicos da etapa demolhagem do trigo do processo de fabricação de farinha. Nesses moinhos, as paredes das roscas molhadora e distribuidora dos grãos de trigo apresentavam crostas com elevada atividade de água - 0, 98, favorável à multiplicação microbiana. A limpeza das roscas era apenas mensal e a água usada na etapa da molhagem dos grãos não era clorada. Os estudos de APPCC/HACCP realizados indicaram que a etapa de molhagem era para estes moinhos um Ponto Crítico de Controle (PCC), constatando-se que as contagens microbianas 24 horas após a limpeza atingiam valores muito elevados. As medidas de controle adotadas foram a remoção diária das crostas para cloração entre 1 a 2 ppm da água, ou remoção semanal das crostas com cloração de 100 ppm da água. Verificou-se que água clorada de 1 a 2 ppm não melhorava as contagens microbianas na crosta, enquanto a cloração a 100 ppm baixava as contagens em dois ciclos log. Com esse nível de cloração, a limpeza podia ser feita semanalmente. Análises de verificação feitas em farinha de trigo apontaram que essas medidas de controle reduziam o risco de rejeição do produto por empresas clientes fabricantes de prqdutos derivados de trigo que adotam critérios microbiológicos bastante restritivos, mais rigorosos que os estabelecidos pela legislação pertinente. The {{importance}} of introduction of HACCP system in wheat flour mills was evaluated in three mills of the South and Southeast regions of Brasil, {{focusing on the}} microbiological aspects of the grains wetting step of the flour production process. In these mills, {{the walls of the}} wetting augers and <b>auger</b> <b>conveyors</b> presented crusts with high water activity - 0, 98, conducive to microbial growth. The cleaning of these points had been carried out on a monthly basis, using non-chlorinated water. HACCP studies indicated that the grains wetting step was a Criticai Control Point (CCP) and 24 hours after cleaning the microbial counts were very high. The control measures were removal of crusts on a daily basis using chlorination of water at 1 to 2 ppm, or removal of crusts on a weekly basis using chlorination at 100 ppm. The reduction of counts when 1 to 2 ppm chlorinated water was used was insignificant, but 100 ppm achieved two logs reduction. Using this level of chlorination, the cleaning could be done on a weekly basis. Verification analysis, carried out on wheat flour, indicated that these measures reduced the risk of rejection of the product by pasta and bakery goods manufacturers with strict microbiological acceptance criteria...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the extent to which precipitation affects the mobility of pesticides in a sandy loam soil which received no additional irrigation. During a four month period, 172 mm of rain fell on the experimental plots to which ordram, simazine and carbofuran had been applied at a rate of O. OOlkg active ingredient mm 2. A qualitative evaluation of soil cores taken upon conclusion of the study indicated that the bulk of the pesticide applied was not detectable below a depth of 0. 76 m. The use of two sampling techniques, split barrel <b>mobile</b> drill <b>auger</b> vs bucket-auger, to collect the samples, enabled a comparison which indicated that the use oi a bucket-auger to collect contaminated samples in dry sandy soils, may not be the most appropriate method. i Acknowledgments The authors wish to thank Cindy Garretson for performing organic carbon analyses on the samples generated from this study, and seasonal personnel, including Holly Haggerty and Allen Lee, for their contribution to particle size analysis and field work, respectively.

40|$|A {{pelletizing}} {{machine for}} the production of fish feed was designed and developed. It consists of a hopper, barrel which houses the screw <b>conveyor</b> (<b>auger),</b> the cutting knife and the die orifice. The machine is driven by a 2 kW, 1420 rpm single phase electric motor. The performance evaluation of the machine was carried out. The aim was to investigate the effects of moisture contents and the speed of operation on the performance of the machine. It was observed that the pelletizing efficiency, throughput capacity and the percentage recovery of the machine increased with the increase in moisture content and the speed of the machine. The machine showed higher throughput capacity of 19. 7 kg/h with maximum pelletizing efficiency of 87. 6 %. Moisture content constituted a greater portion of variability in efficiency than speed. A unit increase in moisture content resulted in an increase of about 20 % in pelleting efficiency whereas a corresponding unit increase in speed only increased the pelletizing efficiency by 3 %. The machine does not make use of steam thereby making it easier to operate. The adoption of the pelletizing machine by small and medium scale farmers {{would go a long way}} in helping them to produce their own feed with local contents thereby alleviating the problems associated with the sourcing of imported feeds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Screw(Auger) {{conveyors}} {{are widely}} used for transporting and/or elevating particulates at controlled and steady rates. They are used in many bulk material applications in industries ranging from industrial minerals, agriculture, chemicals, pigments, plastics, cement, sand, salt and food processing. They are also used for metering (measuring the flow rate) from storage bins and adding small controlled amounts of trace materials such as pigments to granular materials or powders. Here {{in this paper we}} represent the modification of screw conveyor for get same output from modified design with reduced size and less power consumption. And also given the generalized design of shaftless screw conveyor(SSC) for 2 tonnes per hour capacity to convey cement. The finite element analysis (FEA) of both model is given so we can easily find that the design is safe or not for industrial use. The rate of volume transfer is proportional to the rotation rate of the shaft. In industrial control applications the device is often used as a variable rate feeder by varying the rotation rate of the shaft to deliver a measured rate or quantity of material into a process. Screw conveyors can be operated with the flow of material inclined upward. When space allows, this is a very economical method of elevating and conveying. As the angle of inclination increases, the allowable capacity of a given unit rapidly decreases. Keywords—Screw <b>conveyor,</b> <b>Auger,</b> SSC, FEA, bulk material...|$|R
