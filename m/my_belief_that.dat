500|$|En Esch, {{one of the}} {{longtime}} core members of KMFDM, had almost {{nothing to do with}} Xtort, contributing to just two songs. With regard to Esch's lack of participation, Konietzko said, [...] "En Esch is just En Esch. He never made himself available to do this album, and so it's always <b>my</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> the thing must keep moving; I had to do it without him." [...] He also said the two were not in communication {{around the time of the}} album's release.|$|E
500|$|Simon Sweetman from North & South {{described}} the album as [...] "an almost understated collection of love songs– possibly Moa's strongest effort." [...] The Bay of Plenty Times Kristin MacFarlane said that [...] "Anika Moa fans...certainly won't be disappointed". Vicki Anderson of The Press complimented Moa's lyrics, writing, [...] "Whoever coined the phrase 'heart on sleeve' {{must have had}} Moa in mind." [...] She concluded, [...] "Love in Motion only serves to confirm <b>my</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> Anika Moa is one of New Zealand's best songwriters." ...|$|E
500|$|Moreover, Black took {{a narrow}} {{view of what}} {{constituted}} [...] "speech" [...] under the First Amendment; for him, [...] "conduct" [...] did not deserve the same protections that [...] "speech" [...] did. For example, {{he did not believe}} that flag burning was speech; in Street v. New York (1969), he wrote: [...] "It passes <b>my</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> anything in the Federal Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning of the American flag an offense." [...] Similarly, he dissented from Cohen v. California (1971), in which the Court held that wearing a jacket emblazoned with the words [...] "Fuck the Draft" [...] was speech protected by the First Amendment. He asserted that this activity [...] "was mainly conduct, and little speech." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ferdin's stance {{remained}} unchanged; [...] "I {{stand by}} <b>my</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> a coyote {{did not kill}} Keen." [...] Councilman Frank Quintero stated: [...] "What the activists said at the dais was cruel and absolutely uninformed ... Knowing the mother, it broke my heart {{that they would do}} that to her. When they were making the accusations, I was considering stopping them." ...|$|R

500|$|In September 2011, Bennett {{appeared}} on The Howard Stern Show and named American military {{actions in the}} Middle East as {{the root cause of}} the September 11 attacks. [...] Bennett also claimed that former President George W. Bush personally told him at the Kennedy Center in December 2005 that he felt he had made a mistake invading Iraq, to which a Bush spokesperson replied, [...] "This account is flatly wrong." [...] Following bad press resulting from his remarks, Bennett clarified his position, writing: [...] "There is simply no excuse for terrorism and the murder of the nearly 3,000 innocent victims of the 9/11 attacks on our country. My life experiences, ranging from the Battle of the Bulge to marching with Martin Luther King, made me a life-long humanist and pacifist, and reinforced <b>my</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> violence begets violence and that war is the lowest form of human behavior." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{publishing}} the book, Chang received hate mail, primarily from Japanese ultranationalists, and threatening notes on {{her car and}} also believed her phone was tapped. Her mother said the book [...] "made Iris sad". Suffering from depression, Chang was diagnosed with brief reactive psychosis in August 2004. She began taking medications to stabilize her mood. She wrote: I can never shake <b>my</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> I was being recruited, and later persecuted, by forces more powerful than I could have imagined. Whether it was the CIA or some other organization I will never know. As long as I am alive, these forces will never stop hounding me. Chang committed suicide on November 9, 2004. A memorial service was held in China by Nanking Massacre survivors coinciding with her funeral in Los Altos, California. The Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre, a memorial site in Nanjing built to commemorate {{the victims of the}} Nanking Massacre, added a wing dedicated to her in 2005.|$|E
500|$|The obverse of the Lafayette dollar {{features}} jugate, or conjoined, {{heads of}} Washington and Lafayette. Slabaugh noted Barber's account that the busts {{were based on}} the sculpture by Houdon and the medal by Caunois, but, [...] "possibly these did have some effect on the design but it has always been <b>my</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> the immediate source or idea for the design was the Yorktown Centennial medal of 1881." [...] Swiatek and Breen contended that although the ultimate ancestor of Barber's depiction of Washington was the Houdon bust, the source of the Lafayette bust and the format of the obverse [...] "was beyond doubt Peter L. Krider's Yorktown Centennial Medal (1881)". Krider, a Philadelphia engraver not employed by the Mint, issued a number of tokens and medals in the 1870s and 1880s. [...] "United States of America" [...] and [...] "Lafayette Dollar" [...] appear at {{the top and bottom of}} the obverse of the coin.|$|E

500|$|... "I {{really had}} {{no option but to}} agree to do it, despite my {{reservations}} about working in television. Coming so quickly after my decision to stay on the radio, this was quite an irony. I was given one day of training... from one minute to zero, at which point you have to say goodbye. I did not find that easy at all... I made a real hash of it after one of the early games..... very kindly, suggested a plan... as soon as the count started in our earpieces I would ask him a question, and he would talk until the count reached eight seconds to go. I would then thank him, turn to the camera and tell the audience briefly about the next game to be televised. Miraculously, {{for the rest of the}} tournament I always heard 'zero' in my ear at the moment I said goodbye... the whole experience served to confirm <b>my</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> my decision to stick with Test Match Special was the right one." ...|$|E
500|$|... "At Long Last Leave" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics, [...] particularly for its couch gag in the Simpsons opening sequence. This couch gag features a frame-by-frame montage of previous couch gags that pulls {{back into a}} photomosaic of the number [...] "500". The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs wrote that the [...] "best thing about the 500th Simpsons episode is the opening couch montage, which hits the nostalgia bullseye almost perfectly." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall praised the couch gag as being [...] "marvelous", noting that it [...] "actually made me choke up a bit." [...] Sepinwall commended [...] "At Long Last Leave", commenting that [...] "like many latter-day Simpsons outings, [...] features a story we've seen variations on several times before (including in The Simpsons Movie), but also features many funny jokes that affirm <b>my</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> I'm happier {{to live in a}} world that keeps giving us new Simpsons episodes [...] than I will be in the one where that inevitably stops." [...] Similarly to Sepinwall, Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "I got a few laughs and that's all I ever look for in The Simpsons these days. I just like knowing it's still there. [...] It doesn't have the spring in the legs quite like it used to. It's not going to dazzle at the same spectacular rate. But even after 500 episodes, it still has a little something left." [...] Goodman described the couch gag as [...] "lovely".|$|E

2500|$|Wheatfield {{backdrop}}: The {{backdrop of}} the painting is a wheat field being devoured by grasshoppers under the blazing hot sun (this derives from an incident on the Kurelek farm when William was a boy).

2500|$|Rabbi Shapiro later recalled, [...] "After Kid Cann's funeral, I {{received}} a call from someone who asked how could I possibly officiate at the funeral of such a terrible human being?

[...] His former teacher and fellow illustrator Nigel Lambourne has described him as [...] "one of the few great illustrators we've got.
