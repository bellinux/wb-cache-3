500|$|The 1947 nuclear {{stockpile}} {{consisted of}} nuclear weapons components, not weapons. Meeting with Truman in April 1947, Lilienthal informed him that not only were there no assembled weapons, but {{there were only a}} few sets of components, and no fully trained bomb assembly teams. By August 1946, Sandia Base held electrical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>assemblies</b> for about 50 Fat Man bombs, but there were only nine fissile cores in storage. The stockpile of cores grew to 13 in 1947, and 53 in 1948. Oppenheimer noted that the bombs were [...] "still largely the haywire contraptions that were slapped together in 1945." [...] With a half-life of only 140 days, the polonium-beryllium modulated neutron initiators had to be periodically removed from the plutonium pits, tested, and, if necessary, replaced. The cores had to be stored separately from the high explosive blocks that would surround them in the bomb because they generated enough heat to melt the plastic explosive over time. The heat could also affect the cores themselves, provoking a phase transition to a different allotrope of plutonium. They had to be periodically inspected by technicians wearing gloves and respirators. The bomb's electrical power for its radar fuzes and detonators came from a pair of lead-acid batteries similar to those used in cars. These had to be charged 24 hours before use. After a few days, the bomb had to be partially disassembled so that they could be re-charged; and three days after that the batteries had to be replaced.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a <b>mechanical</b> <b>assembly</b> system called LAMA (Language for Automatic <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Assembly).</b> The {{goal of the}} work {{was to create a}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>assembly</b> system that transforms a high-level description of an automatic assembly operation into a program or execution by a computer controlled manipulator. This system allows the initial description of the assembly to be in terms of the desired effects on the parts being assembled. Languages such as WAVE [Bolles & Paul] and MINI [Silver] fail to meet this goal by requiring the assembly operation to be described in terms of manipulator motions. This research concentrates on the spatial complexity of <b>mechanical</b> <b>assembly</b> operations. The assembly problem is seen as the problem of achieving a certain set of geometrical constraints between basic objects while avoiding unwanted collisions. The thesis explores how these two facets, desired constraints and unwanted collisions, affect the primitive operations of the domain...|$|R

40|$|Rejection costs {{incurred}} due to screening inspection {{depend on the}} proportion of a product output that fails to meet screening limits. When the screening limits are predetermined, the output proportion that is either reworked or scrapped {{is a function of}} process mean (process target). A number of mathematical models have been developed to determine optimal process target for a final product with single or multiple quality characteristics. However, these models are single-stage optimization models and may not be directly applied to a <b>mechanical</b> <b>assembly.</b> An economic selection of the process targets for components based on the minimization of rejection costs for components and subassemblies constituting the <b>mechanical</b> <b>assembly</b> can be formulated as a multi-stage decision problem.

5000|$|They then {{proposed}} that [...] "it may {{be shown to}} follow that the condition for thermal equilibrium between several assemblies is the equality of a certain single-valued function of the thermodynamic states of the assemblies, which may be called the temperature t, {{any one of the}} assemblies being used as a [...] "thermometer" [...] reading the temperature t on a suitable scale. This postulate of the [...] "Existence of temperature" [...] could with advantage be known as the zeroth law of thermodynamics". The first sentence of this present article is a version of this statement.
