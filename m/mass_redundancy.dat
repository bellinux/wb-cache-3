40|$|Worker {{and union}} {{responses}} to <b>mass</b> <b>redundancy</b> announcements are complex. This article explores a <b>mass</b> <b>redundancy</b> announcement {{with the purpose}} of shedding light on the way collective responses are shaped at such times. The article focuses on steelworker redundancies in South Wales (United Kingdom) in 2001 and 2002, which occurred at the Corus plc steelworks at Ebbw Vale in Blaenau Gwent and Llanwern, Newport, and argues that management handles such announcements in strategic ways to neutralize collective responses. Further, the article contends that the way trade unions organize and operate can result in union members being demobilized, thereby restricting alternative courses of action. Central to the analysis are understandings of the ways information, in the form of rumour and through more formal channels, flows between management, union and the membership/workforce...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the job prospects of displaced industrial workers in Switzerland. Based on a survey of 1, 203 workers who were dismissed after their manufacturing plants closed down, we analyse the determinants of re-employment, the sector of re-employment and the change in wages. Two years after displacement, a majority of workers were back in employment: 69 % were re-employed, 17 % un-employed and 11 % retired. Amongst re-employed workers, two thirds found a job in manufacturing and one third in services. Contrary to a common belief, low-end services are not the collecting vessel of redundant industrial workers. Displaced workers aged 55 and older seem particularly vulnerable after a plant closes down: over 30 % were long-term unemployed, and those older workers who found a new job suffered disproportionate wage losses. Advanced age-and not low education-appears as the primary handicap after <b>mass</b> <b>redundancy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Complete genomes of many organisms {{have been}} {{recorded}} using high throughput nucleic acid sequencing; however the intricate functions of the gene products remain largely undiscovered. As the most prominent technology for polypeptide sequence determination and quantification, mass spectrometry is used extensively to address questions regarding the behaviours of proteins in the biological context. The capacity of mass spectrometers to measure covalent modifications of amino acids is also of great value {{in the investigation of}} biological processes since specific reactive sites within proteins modulate their activity. Integration of liquid chromatography into mass spectrometry platforms has greatly improved sensitivity and throughput and is of particular benefit in the analysis of highly complex polypeptide mixtures. Studies of the behaviours of individual intracellular proteins in bacterial, plant and metazoan systems employing liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry are described herein. The phosphorylation of individual residues and resulting alterations in function were determined in GraR and VraR, two antibiotic resistance factors in Staphylococcus aureus. Three phosphosites of starch branching enzyme IIb which appear to regulate starch biosynthesis in Zea mays as well as kinases for which these sites are putative substrates were identified. Regulation of the multifunctional protein beta-catenin by p 38 mitogen activated protein kinase was explored. Gene products with affinity for the highly conserved multifunctional protein beta-catenin, including several not previously known to interact, were identified from Rattus norvegicus smooth muscle cells. The specificity of peptide ion mass and peptide fragment ion mass relative to instrumental mass accuracy and the consequence for tandem-mass spectrometry-based quantification are explored in a separate chapter. In silico comparison of peptide ion/product ion mass pairs calculated from the human proteome revealed a range of <b>mass</b> <b>redundancy</b> from high to low simulated mass accuracy.

The very molecular features that confer binding potency and specificity, such as stereochemistry, regiochemistry, and scaffold rigidity, are conspicuously absent from most libraries because isomer-ism introduces <b>mass</b> <b>redundancy</b> and diverse scaffolds yield uninterpretable MS fragmentation. Here we present DNA-encoded solid-phase synthesis (DESPS), comprising parallel compound synthesis in organic solvent and aqueous enzymatic ligation of unprotected encoding dsDNA oligonucleotides. Computational encoding language design yielded 148 thermodynamically optimized sequences with Hamming string distance ≥ 3 and total read length < 100 bases for facile sequencing.

There {{is a problem of}} restraining of <b>mass</b> <b>redundancy</b> of mechanical structures for electronic equipment in relation to the weight of the electronic components.

These problems can be solved in different ways, the main of which are the following: a) development of new mechanical structures for electronic equipment taking into account the development of the electronic components; b) improving layout characteristics of mechanical structures for electronic equipment without significant changes in their architecture. The aim {{of the study was to}} research mechanical structures of the first level (plug-in units and modules of the second level) of subracks to improve layout characteristics, and to develop methods for the use of connections for surface mounting and for the use of printed circuit boards of smaller dimensions without changing the architecture of the mechanical structures in order to improve layout characteristics. The research allowed the authors to develop the following solutions: 1. The design of plug-in units in which instead of one printed circuit board (PCB) may be two, three or more PCBs of smaller dimensions to compensate a decrease in PCB fill factor in time and to increase the functional capacity of electronic modules. 2. Construction of block designs with a bilateral arrangement of plug-in units and the organization of the electrical connections by way of backplanes with electrical connectors for surface mounting, which allows performing independent installation of plug-in units on both sides of the backplane and creates conditions for increasing the number of plug-in units. The proposed solutions do not lead to a change in the architecture of standard mechanical structures for electronic equipment or any performance degradation...|$|E

5000|$|In (French speaking) Belgium {{the term}} Procédure Renault {{has become a}} synonym for the {{consultation}} process leading to <b>mass</b> <b>redundancies,</b> due to a controversial mass layoff and resultant legislation in the late 1990s. When an employee has been laid off in Australia their employer has to give them redundancy pay, which {{is also known as}} severance pay. The only time that a redundancy payment doesn’t have to be paid is if an employee is casual, working for a small business or has worked for a business for less than twelve months. The redundancy compensation payment for employees depends on the length of time an employee has worked for an employer which excludes unpaid leave. If an employer can’t afford the redundancy payment they are supposed to give their employee, once making them redundant, or they find their employee another job that is suitable for the employee. An employer is able to apply for a reduction in the amount of money they have to pay the employee they have made redundant. An employer can do this by applying to the Fair Work Commission for a redundancy payment reduction. [...] A layoff is also known as a retrenchment in (South African English). In the UK, permanent termination due to elimination of a position is usually called redundancy. [...] Certain countries (such as Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Italy, France and Germany), distinguish between leaving the company of one's own free will, in which case the person is not entitled to unemployment benefits, but may receive a onetime payment and leaving a company as part of a reduction in labour force size, in which case the person is entitled to them. A RIF reduces the number of positions, rather than laying off specific people, and is usually accompanied by internal redeployment.|$|R

Findings Peptrix finds about the same number of peptide features as the other packages, but peptide masses are in some cases approximately 5 to 10 times less redundant present in the peptide profile matrix. The Peptrix profile matrix displays the largest overlap when comparing the number of masses in a pair between two software applications. The overlap of peptide masses between software packages of low intensity peaks in the spectra is remarkably low with about 50 % of the detected masses in the individual packages. Peptrix does not differ from the other packages in detecting 96 % of the masses that relate to highly abundant sequenced proteins. MS 1 peak intensities vary between the applications in a non linear way as they are not processed using the same method. Conclusions Peptrix is capable of peptide profiling using Orbitrap™ files and finding differential expressed peptides in body fluid and tissue samples. The number of peptide masses detected in Orbitrap™ files can be increased by using more MS 1 peptide profiling applications, including Peptrix, since it appears from the comparison of Peptrix with the other applications that all software packages have likely a high false negative rate of low intensity peptide peaks (missing peptides). </p...|$|R

I föreliggande avhandling av Alexis Rydell ligger fokus på relationerna mellan ledning och arbetstagarorganisationer under nedläggningsprocesser.   Ett nedläggningsbeslut skapar spänning mellan parterna, inte minst eftersom nedläggnings­beslutet ofta innebär negativa konsekvenser för de anställda. Avhandlingen visar hur olika förhållningssätt mellan parterna kan skapa olika förutsättningar för att reducera spänningen och mildra de negativa konsekvenserna. Utifrån fallstudier identifieras nyckelfaktorer för partssamverkan och hur konstruktiva lösningar kan möjliggöras under processen. Dessutom analyseras vilka kontextuella faktorer som påverkar processen och dess potentiella inverkan på utfallen. Avslutningsvis presenteras ett förslag till modell för partsrelationer i nedläggningar.  The main {{topic of}} this thesis is union-management {{relations}} during plant closures. The thesis includes five papers. The first paper {{is based on}} a case study that illustrates how management and unions can exchange numerical flexibility with social responsibility to create favorable solutions. This is called a “local flexicurity model in restructuring processes. ” The second paper is based on multiple case studies and stresses the importance of longer transition periods that include active Human Resource Management (HRM) efforts toward the local community, which are labeled as “outreach HRM. ” The benefit of a longer transition period is that it gives employees, unions and local communities time to plan activities that may mitigate the adverse effects of the closure. The third paper addresses the dynamics of the local labor market and jobseekers’ willingness to commute to work, showing how socio-economic factors affect an individual’s willingness to commute. This implies that socio-economic factors may affect the ability to reconnect to new employment. The fourth paper is based on two case studies. It develops a typology of patterns in union-management relations, which is described as coordination and separation, and it reveals five key factors that contribute to creating the different patterns. It also shows how tension between management and labor can be reduced. The fifth paper is an international comparative study of Sweden and Australia. The paper deals with institutional differences with regard to how <b>mass</b> <b>redundancies</b> and plant closures are handled. Regulations that facilitate the voice of the union and employees are critically examined and illustrated through cases from both countries. Partly based on the five papers, the thesis proposes a model that addresses union-management relations in plant closures. The model takes context, process and outcomes into account.
