40|$|The {{structuring}} of <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> {{communication management}} within key organisations in South Africa is changing. These changes are affecting {{the relationship between}} <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> communication practitioners, {{as well as the}} key tasks they are responsible for within the organisation. Globally, companies are downsizing, restructuring and eliminating hierarchy. This article investigates how key South African companies have responded to these changes, by looking at how the <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> communication functions are structured within the organisation. <b>Marketing</b> <b>and</b> communication managers from top South African companies were interviewed telephonically. Findings from the study indicate that the two functions are progressively moving towards an integrated approach. However, a commonly agreed organisational structure is still not pervasive. Each organisation structured the <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> communication functions differently, and various perspectives existed on the key tasks of both <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> communication managers. From these findings, it is evident that the relationship between <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> communication, as well as the role <b>and</b> tasks of <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> communication managers, is still very diverse in the South African context...|$|R

5|$|Each civilization can {{purchase}} upgrades {{that increase the}} rate of gathering these resources. Players can construct a marketplace for trade; players can trade wood, stone, and food for gold, and use gold to buy other resources. Market prices fluctuate with every transaction. Furthermore, <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> docks can also generate gold by using trading carts or cogs which are used to visit foreign <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> ports; once they return to the player's market/dock, gold {{is added to the}} stockpile. The amount of gold a trade unit earns on each trip is related to the distance it had to travel to a foreign market; more gold is earned on longer trips. It is possible to trade with enemies' markets or docks, but the player's trading units may be attacked or destroyed by enemy units in the process. Players do not need to keep trading manually, as once they select the port or market the trading units infinitely continue to trade.|$|E
