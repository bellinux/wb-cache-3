5|$|Orientalism {{proposed}} that much Western study of Islamic civilization was political intellectualism, <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> the self-affirmation of European identity, rather than objective academic study; thus, the academic field of Oriental studies {{functioned as a}} practical method of cultural discrimination and imperialist domination—that is to say, the Western Orientalist knows more about the Orient than do the Orientals.|$|E
5|$|Small {{numbers of}} frill sharks are caught {{incidentally}} by various deepwater commercial fisheries around the world, using trawls, gillnets, and longlines. In particular, it is regularly taken in Suruga Bay in bottom gillnets <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> sea bream and gnomefish, and in midwater trawls <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> the shrimp Sergia lucens. Japanese fishermen {{regard it as}} a nuisance, as it damages the nets. This shark is sometimes sold for meat or processed into fishmeal, but is not economically significant. Because of its very low reproductive rate and the continuing expansion of commercial fisheries into its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has previously listed it as Near Threatened, although the species was downlisted to Least Concern in 2016.|$|E

5|$|Some mammals are omnivores {{and display}} {{varying degrees of}} carnivory and herbivory, {{generally}} leaning in favor of one more than the other. Since plants and meat are digested differently, there is a preference for one over the other, as in bears where some species may be mostly carnivorous and others mostly herbivorous. They are grouped into three categories: mesocarnivory (50-70% meat), hypercarnivory (70% and greater of meat), and hypocarnivory (50% or less of meat). The dentition of hypocarnivores consists of dull, triangular carnassial teeth <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> grinding food. Hypercarnivores, however, have conical teeth and sharp carnassials <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> slashing, {{and in some cases}} strong jaws for bone-crushing, {{as in the case of}} hyenas, allowing them to consume bones; some extinct groups, notably the Machairodontinae, had saber-shaped canines.|$|E

5|$|A longer 116-minute copy of {{the film}} has not been {{released}} officially, but has been found as a bootleg. This copy is a poor-quality videocassette dub and has a burned-in time code in the corner indicating that the film was not <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> public viewing. However, the European, Japanese and Australian DVD releases restore three minutes of the violent footage missing from the Region 1 DVD (that was cut for an R rating), making them the versions closest to Woo's original cut.|$|E

As Lara tries to force the helicopter pilot to land, they are brought down, with Lara nearly dying. Roth revives Lara, then takes a fatal blow from Mathias <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> her.|$|E
5|$|Alpine {{skiing is}} an Olympic sport, contested at the Winter Olympic Games. The first Winter Olympics, held in 1924, {{included}} nordic skiing, {{but the first}} alpine skiing events were not held until 1936 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. A combined event was held {{for both men and}} women in 1936. The International Ski Federation (FIS) decided that ski instructors could not compete in 1936 because they were professionals, and the Olympics were <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> amateur athletes. Because of this, Austrian and Swiss skiers boycotted the events, although some Austrians decided to compete for Germany.|$|E

5|$|As part of Microsoft's {{unification}} strategies, Windows {{products that}} are based on Windows 10's common platform but <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> specialized platforms are marketed as editions of the operating system, rather than as separate product lines. An updated version of Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system for smartphones, and also tablets, was branded as Windows 10 Mobile. Editions of Enterprise and Mobile will also be produced for embedded systems, along with Windows 10 IoT Core, which is designed specifically for use in small footprint, low-cost devices and Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios and is similar to Windows Embedded.|$|E
5|$|Development {{for a third}} {{movie was}} {{announced}} in 2009, with Dan Lin as the producer. Lin intends to reboot the film series with a young Croft in an origin story.

The film, originally <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> a 2013 release, is to be produced by Graham King, written by Marti Noxon and produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in partnership with King's studio GK Films. On 28 April 2016, {{it was announced that}} Alicia Vikander would be playing Lara in the next film adaptation.|$|E

5|$|However, the Rashtrakuta kings also patronized Hinduism's {{followers}} of the Shaiva, Vaishnava and Shakta faiths. Almost all of their inscriptions begin with an invocation to god Vishnu or god Shiva. The Sanjan inscriptions tell of King Amoghavarsha I sacrificing a finger from his left hand at the Lakshmi temple at Kolhapur to avert a calamity in his kingdom. King Dantidurga performed the Hiranyagarbha (horse sacrifice) and the Sanjan and Cambay plates of King Govinda IV mention Brahmins performing such rituals as Rajasuya, Vajapeya and Agnishtoma. An early copper plate grant of King Dantidurga (753) shows an image of god Shiva and the coins of his successor, King Krishna I (768), bear the legend Parama Maheshwara (another name for Shiva). The kings' titles such as Veeranarayana showed their Vaishnava leanings. Their flag had {{the sign of the}} Ganges and Yamuna rivers, perhaps copied from the Badami Chalukyas. The famous Kailasnatha temple at Ellora and other rock-cut caves attributed to them show that the Hinduism was flourishing. Their family deity was a goddess by name Latana (also known as Rashtrashyena, Manasa Vindyavasini) who took the form of a falcon to save the kingdom. They built temples with icons and ornamentation that satisfied the needs of different faiths. The temple at Salotgi was <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> {{followers of}} Shiva and Vishnu and the temple at Kargudri was <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> worshipers of Shiva, Vishnu and Bhaskara (Surya, the sun god).|$|E

And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E

Pramono, writing for Tempo, notes that the film presents a different side of Dahlan, who is usually portrayed as an old, bearded man who, in his opinion, seems neither modernist nor progressive.|$|E
