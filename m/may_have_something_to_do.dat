25|$|The {{words are}} {{somewhat}} generic: henqêe {{may be used}} for any spotted cat, hushuee (hushuwee) for any running ground bird. 'Lion' and 'eland' use the same root. Blench (2008) thinks this <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the eland being considered magical in the region.|$|E
500|$|On February 6, 1999, a team {{of three}} biologists, led by Professor Jonathan Hoffman, {{investigate}} a series of supposed wildlife killings in a wooded area near a small New York town. One of the biologists, Bianca, suspects that the killings <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with a recent earthquake. When Hoffman and the other biologist, Gabriel, go off to investigate the wildlife disappearances, they discover the corpse of a mutilated deer. Upon returning to the campsite, they find that Bianca has discovered {{a hole in the}} ground. From this, the group determines that a prehistoric creature that has been frozen for thousands of years was freed by the earthquake, and has been killing the wildlife. The creature appears and kills both Gabriel and Bianca, leaving Hoffman to deduce that it is a [...] "snow shark", before it bites him.|$|E
500|$|Pattycake moved {{permanently}} to the Bronx Zoo on December 20, 1982. For a few years, {{she lived}} in a cage with Pansy, a chimpanzee. [...] In June 1999, Pattycake moved into the Wildlife Conservation Society's $43 million Congo Gorilla Forest exhibit. [...] The exhibit includes a Great Gorilla Forest viewing area that separates gorillas and visitors with a glass window. Two troops of gorillas inhabited the 6.5 acre exhibit, with a dozen gorillas in Pattycake's troop alone, including Fubo, Pattycake, Tunko, Triska, Halima, Fran, Layla, Kumi, Suki, Babatunde, Barbara, and M'domo. The general curator of the Bronx Zoo, James Doherty, described Pattycake as [...] "independent" [...] with [...] "few close friends" [...] in the Congo Gorilla Forest. [...] "It <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the fact that she didn't live with her parents that long, and lived with that chimpanzee for a few years," [...] Doherty said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A captive has {{no choice}} save to listen,' {{returned}} Eleanor; 'but as to speaking of terms, my brothers-in-law, the Dauphin and the Duke of Brittany, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say to them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps the Moon, her mother, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say in that matter," [...] said Huaracha gloomily. [...] "Still, let it lie for the while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... {{should be}} given andante, and not con strepito: {{but this is a}} faute bien legere in the midst of such {{unrivalled}} excellence, and only mentioned here that we <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>SOMETHING</b> <b>to</b> criticise.|$|R
2500|$|Beldham's sister Hannah (1786–1842) married another leading cricketer of the day, John Wells. [...] As late as 1861, {{forty years}} after his last {{important}} game {{and while he was}} still living, a wall of The Cricketers pub in Wrecclesham still bore the legend [...] "Rendezvous of those Famous Cricketers Beldham & Wells" [...] (another version has the sign as [...] "Good Beer as drunk by those Famous Men Beldham & Wells"). That an early landlord of this pub may well have been one of Beldham's brothers <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with this early example of celebrity endorsement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps it {{is better}} not to be rich, so that one <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> But I {{want you to tell}} me as though you really cared for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold you tongue, Larry, for a little, {{and keep}} your cheerin' till you have done fightin', for it's my opinion we <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in that way ere long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Better go slow," [...] urged {{one of his}} friends. [...] "That chap {{looks to}} me like one of the old guard. He <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say about your doings with his daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, I hope I <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat," [...] the man said, recklessly. [...] "I {{am ready}} to tell my story to whomsoever you like, but am not ready to be starved." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{think women}} do it, and make us, that they <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> worrit about,' said Frank. 'Damp {{stockings}} are the bother of creation till one goes to school; and then, isn't it Jolly!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I {{must make}} a clean sweep of all your materials. We must have no more devil's tricks. In with all these leaves! They <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you think," [...] {{said the}} young soldier, whose general {{knowledge}} {{was a little}} more extensive than that of the seaman, [...] "that the Gulf Stream <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{might try}} it. After all, it's not expensive. There's {{no doubt about}} it," [...] he murmured, {{returning}} to his perusal, [...] "that fellow does look popular. Of course, the evening dress <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I am {{very well}} off as I am," [...] he answered, [...] "but perhaps some day I <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> tell {{you of the}} Easterfields and about their doings up on the mountain." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{shook his}} head. [...] "Perhaps others; but I {{have done with}} preaching for the present. Later I <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say. Now I feel sure of nothing, not even of what I've been saying here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't {{like to say}} {{anything}} about that, Professor," [...] he answered slowly. [...] "I might be accusing a fellow cadet unfairly. If the suitcase isn't returned by to-morrow I <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jake," [...] he said, [...] "is most too mean to live. He {{strikes you}} a dollar for your breakfast {{and another for}} supper, though anybody else would give you a square meal for a quarter. Guess that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ben told me {{that this}} Mr. Enos was once a partner of his father in business, the two running an art store together. Enos was very much {{interested}} in art; so it's possible the fortune he left <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with that," [...] added Dave.|$|E
6000|$|... "The horses {{will keep}} to it, my lord," [...] he said; [...] "their sight {{is a great}} deal better than ours, and I dare say their smell <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it. Besides, the track is clear of bushes, so we should know at once, if they strayed from it." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{promised to}} leave early, {{and to write}} to her soon. 'And when I think the time is ripe,' he said, 'I'll write <b>to</b> her. I <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> tell her that will bring her to graciousness.' ...|$|R
60|$|Up to {{this period}} Sally had shown a decided {{preference}} for the ungrammatical language of the seamen, though she associated freely with Young and Christian. Perhaps her particular fondness for John Adams <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with this.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think not. It {{would be}} better to wait until we hear what Gascoyne has to say, since you haven't seen him as I thought. He <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> send with the other documents. Suppose you come back about this time to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Bundercombe," [...] he explained, [...] "either willfully or otherwise, misinterprets {{the object}} of our coming. It is {{possible}} that his nationality <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it. I have always understood that the standard among Americans with regard to affairs of honor is scarcely so high as in this country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The fact is, Mr. Cossey--the fact is, my father, {{and indeed}} I also, are in great trouble just now, about money matters you know, {{and my father}} is very apt to be prejudiced,--in short, I rather believe that he thinks you <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with his difficulties--but perhaps you know all about it." ...|$|E
60|$|Monster {{waves of}} this kind occur at regular intervals, among the islands of the Pacific, once and {{sometimes}} twice in the year; and this without any additional influence of an earthquake, {{at least in the}} immediate neighbourhood of the islands, though {{it is quite possible that}} earthquakes in some remote part of the world <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with these waves.|$|E
6000|$|He even {{goes so far}} as {{to think}} that the white man <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> learn. The world has belonged to him now for some {{thousands}} of years. Has he done all with it that could have been done? Are his ideals the last word? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your friends <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say to you," [...] he muttered. [...] "If {{you think}} to stop our tongues, you're wrong--wrong, I tell you. The game's up for you, Wingate. The wires that are ruining {{us this morning}} will be telling of your arrest to-night, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Baas is right," [...] {{replied the}} dwarf; [...] "moreover, I am hungry, for sorrow has {{kept me from}} food for these two days. Now I will fill myself full, that I <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> offer to the Black Water when he shakes me in his anger." ...|$|R
60|$|Bugle, shriek, flight resumed. Monied Interest {{has come}} into my carriage. Says the manner of {{refreshing}} is 'not bad,' but considers it French. Admits great dexterity and politeness in the attendants. Thinks a decimal currency <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with their despatch in settling accounts, and don't know but what it's sensible and convenient. Adds, however, as a general protest, that they're a revolutionary people - and always at it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course,' {{proceeded}} the other, 'the {{time of year}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it. Living down in {{the country}} you lose count of time, and I forgot that it was July, when people {{go out of the}} city. I guess that must be what happened. I used to know all sorts of fellows, actors and fellows like that, and they're all away somewhere. I tell you,' he said, with pathos, 'I never knew I could be so infernally lonesome as I have been these last two days. If I had known what a rotten time I was going to have I would never have left Brookport.' ...|$|E
60|$|In this there occurs {{the first}} startling {{reference}} to Mrs. Tenbruggen, by name. She is in London, finding {{her way to}} lucrative celebrity by twisting, turning, and pinching the flesh of credulous persons, afflicted with nervous disorders; and she has already paid a few medical visits to old Mr. Dunboyne. He persists in poring over his books while Mrs. Tenbruggen operates, sometimes on his cramped right hand, sometimes (in the fear that his brain <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it) {{on the back of}} his neck. One of them frowns over her rubbing, and the other frowns over his reading. It would be delightfully ridiculous, but for a drawback; Mr. Philip Dunboyne's first impressions of Mrs. Tenbruggen do not incline him to look at that lady from a humorous point of view.|$|E
6000|$|... "Which is {{not what}} I came to see you about," [...] I {{answered}} brusquely, somewhat nettled by their incomprehension. [...] "I am a stranger here, and I {{want you to tell}} me what you know of the East End, in order that I <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> start on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here it is, comrade, and welcome! Well, I <b>may</b> as well <b>have</b> {{this fine}} scalp that we <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> show for our walk." [...] He held the Indian's head between his knees, {{and in an}} instant, with a sweep of his knife, had torn off the hideous {{dripping}} trophy.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} to fear," [...] he said, [...] "except the bad air and the ghosts of smugglers, if you are superstitious enough to fear them. Only, when you are {{perfectly}} satisfied, and you are convinced that your errand here has been fruitless, perhaps I <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say." ...|$|R
