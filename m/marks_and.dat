5|$|As Professor Bernard Quatermass (Brian Donlevy) {{struggles to}} gain {{government}} {{support for his}} moon colonisation project, his interest becomes focused on reports of hundreds of meteorites landing in Winnerden Flats. Travelling there with Marsh, his colleague (Bryan Forbes), Quatermass finds a huge complex under construction, based on his lunar colony plans. Marsh finds an undamaged meteorite is shaped like a small stone rocket. It then cracks open, releasing a gas, leaving him with an odd V-shaped mark on his face. Black-clad guards from the complex arrive, armed with machine guns and sporting similar V-shaped <b>marks,</b> <b>and</b> take Marsh away, knocking down Quatermass and ordering him to leave.|$|E

5|$|Cho was {{initially}} supposed to enroll at the Moscow University, {{but he was}} robbed at a train station in Omsk. With no money, Cho was stranded and had {{to work at a}} kolkhoz in Omsk for the summer to get some. The rector of the Omsk University, Aleksandr Sergeevitch Slivko was touched by his fate and decided to admit him in the university. Thus, from 1933 until his graduation in 1937, he attended the Faculty of Literature of the Gorky Omsk State Pedagogical University. Although he was not fluent in Russian upon entering the university, he graduated with excellent <b>marks,</b> <b>and</b> his time spent there amplified his Russian and Soviet sides.|$|E
5|$|Gröning {{left school}} with high <b>marks</b> <b>and</b> began a {{traineeship}} {{as a bank}} clerk when he was 17, but war was declared shortly after he started employment and eight of the twenty clerks present were immediately conscripted into the army. This allowed the remaining trainees to further their banking careers {{in a relatively short}} amount of time; however, despite these opportunities, Gröning and his colleagues were inspired by Germany's quick victories in France and Poland and wanted to contribute.|$|E
5|$|In 18th century France, {{there was}} a {{national}} weight standard, the marc de Paris of 8 ounces. The civil pound of 16 ounces was equivalent to 2 <b>marks,</b> <b>and</b> it was also used as the apothecaries' pound. With 30.6g, the ounces were considerably heavier than other apothecaries' ounces in Romance countries, but otherwise the French system was not remarkable. Its history and connections to the English and Flemish standards are discussed below under Weight standards named after Troyes.|$|E

5|$|Jaguar females reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{about two years}} of age, and males at three or four. The cat is believed to mate throughout {{the year in the}} wild, although births may increase when prey is plentiful. Research on captive male jaguars supports the year-round mating hypothesis, with no seasonal variation in semen traits and ejaculatory quality; low reproductive success has also been observed in captivity. Female estrus is 6–17 days out of a full 37-day cycle, and females will advertise fertility with urinary scent <b>marks</b> <b>and</b> increased vocalization. Both sexes will range more widely than usual during courtship.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{caused the}} South Melbourne {{coaching}} staff concern when he fractured two fingers in a match against Hawthorn {{two weeks before}} the final series. Normally this type of injury would require a player to miss six weeks of football but Nash, who kicked six goals in the match, missed just one week, returned for South's Semi-Final win against Richmond and was considered Best on Ground in South Melbourne's 1933 premiership win. In the Grand Final Nash played at centre-half-back, took thirteen <b>marks</b> <b>and</b> had twenty-nine kicks and dominated play.|$|E
5|$|The Pantheon {{was based}} at the far eastern end of Great Marlborough Street. It was built on what had {{previously}} been gardens in 1772, becoming a popular place of entertainment during the late 18th century. The building burned down in 1792 and was rebuilt; it ceased to be an entertainment venue in 1818. It was later used as a bazaar in the mid-19th century before being demolished in 1937. The site is now the main Oxford Street branch of <b>Marks</b> <b>and</b> Spencer which has a side entrance onto Great Marlborough Street.|$|E

The children returned to Kids' Club, and at 18:00 their mother took them back to 5A, while their father went for a tennis lesson. The McCanns put the children to bed around 19:00. Madeleine was left asleep in short-sleeved, pink-and-white <b>Marks</b> <b>and</b> Spencer's Eeyore pyjamas, next to her comfort blanket and a soft toy, Cuddle Cat.|$|E

5|$|Though the bobcat prefers {{rabbits and}} hares, it hunts insects, chickens, geese and other birds, small rodents, and deer. Prey {{selection}} depends on location and habitat, season, and abundance. Like most cats, the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary, although with some overlap in home ranges. It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries, including claw <b>marks</b> <b>and</b> deposits of urine or feces. The bobcat breeds from winter into spring {{and has a}} gestation period of about two months.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} the destruction of monuments and interruption of new construction at the site occurred simultaneously with the arrival of so-called Naranjo style ceramics, which appear to be linked to styles from the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico. The Naranjo ceramic tradition is particularly characteristic of the western Pacific coast of Guatemala between the Suchiate and Nahualate rivers. The most common forms are pitchers and bowls with a surface that has been smoothed with a cloth, leaving parallel <b>marks,</b> <b>and</b> usually coated with a white or yellow wash. At the same time, the use of local Ocosito ceramics waned. This Teotihuacan influence places the destruction of monuments {{in the second half of}} the Early Classic. The presence of the conquerors linked to the Naranjo-style ceramics was not of long duration and suggests that the conquerors exerted long-distance control of the site, replacing the local rulers with their own governors while leaving the local population intact.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 {{parts with}} each part further divided into more precise parts. One type of shadow clock {{consisted}} of a long stem with five variable <b>marks</b> <b>and</b> an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon. Obelisks functioned {{in much the same}} manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the summer and winter solstices. A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500, was similar in shape to a bent T-square. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at noon, so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|Following his 150th appearance, Selwood {{displayed}} {{an improved}} goal kicking ability by kicking 17 {{goals in the}} remaining 7 games of the season. His coach Chris Scott acknowledged that Selwood had identified goal kicking as an area of improvement within his game, and credited Selwood for taking responsibility {{to work hard and}} improve at it. Geelong began their finals series against Fremantle in a Qualifying Final, but were defeated by 15points. The defeat forced the club into a Semi Final against Port Adelaide—the first finals game between both clubs since the 2007 AFL Grand Final. Selwood contributed 27 disposals, 4 <b>marks,</b> <b>and</b> 4 tackles to lead Geelong to a 16point victory—his first finals win as captain. The win ensured Geelong's progression through to the Preliminary Final against Hawthorn, to play-off for a position in the 2013 AFL Grand Final. Despite Selwood's contribution of 23 disposals, 4 tackles, and 1 goal however, the Cats were defeated by 5points and finished the season in third place.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2005 season, {{he signed}} a three-year deal with Melbourne—his last {{contract}} with the club—worth A$1.4m. He {{was an integral part}} of Melbourne's strong 2006 form, as the team won 11 out of 12games after losing the first three matches of the season. He was named among the best Melbourne players in the side's come-from-behind victory against St Kilda in the Elimination Final. Melbourne lost to Fremantle the following week, ending their third consecutive finals series. During 2006, White effected fewer hit-outs than in 2005, although his total number of disposals, <b>marks</b> <b>and</b> goals were all significantly improved. He played all of Melbourne's matches that season, as he did for four seasons from 2004—a consistent run which saw him play more than 100consecutive matches after he missed games in 2003 due to a serious shin injury and a knee injury, until Round 12, 2008. In both 2005 and 2006, he ranked third in the league in number of hit-outs.|$|E
5|$|In late 2007 {{plans were}} {{announced}} {{to create a}} stud book for the breed, a collaborative venture between the Marwari Horse Society of India and the Indian government. A registration process was initiated in 2009, {{when it was announced}} that the Marwari Horse Society had become a government body, the only government-authorized registration society for Marwari horses. The registration process includes an evaluation of the horse against the breed standards, during which unique identification <b>marks</b> <b>and</b> physical dimensions are recorded. After the evaluation, the horse is cold branded with its registration number and photographed. In late 2009 the Indian government announced that the Marwari horse, along with other Indian horse breeds, would be commemorated on a set of stamps issued by that country.|$|E
5|$|It {{had long}} been {{established}} Marcher custom to solve conflicts through private warfare. Hereford's problem, however, was his relative weakness in the Marches, {{and now he was}} facing open conflict with two different enemies. He therefore decided to take the issue to the king instead, in a break with tradition. King Edward again ordered Gloucester to stop, but the earl ignored the order and initiated raids on Hereford's lands. Hostilities continued and Hereford responded, until both earls were arrested and brought before the king. The real offense was not the private warfare in itself, {{but the fact that the}} earls had not respected the king's injunction to cease. In the parliament of January 1292, Gloucester was fined 10,000 <b>marks</b> <b>and</b> Hereford 1,000. Gloucester's liberty of Glamorgan was declared forfeit, and confiscated by the crown, as was Hereford's of Brecon.|$|E
