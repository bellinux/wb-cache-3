40|$|A validated, reversed-phase, isocratic {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic {{method for}} the simultaneous assay of diminazene aceturate, antipyrine (excipient) and diminazene impurities in pharmaceutical formulations is described. The chromatographic system {{consisted of a}} Lichrospher- 60 RP-select B column with a mobile phase composition of acetonitrile–methanol–ammonium formate (pH 4. 0, 20 mM) (10 : 10 : 80 v/v/v) and UV detection at 254 nm. The method is specific, precise and accurate for the determination of diminazene {{in the presence of}} its manufacturing and degradation impurities with a limit of detection and quantification of 50 ng/ml and 10 μg/ml (RSD< 3. 0 %), respectively. The major <b>manufacturing</b> <b>impurity</b> [1 -(4 amidino phenyl) 3 -(4 carbamoyl phenyl) -triazene] and a degradant (p-aminobenzamidine) of diminazene aceturate have been resolved and identified by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry operated in a positive ion mode...|$|E
40|$|Many agrichemical sprays, in {{particular}} some herbicides and insecticides, {{result in a}} strong odour when applied by either ground or aerial spraying techniques. This odour may be evident downwind from the application site for several hundreds of metres or even kilometres. The detection of the odour alerts people {{to the presence of}} chemicals in the air, and in many cases those affected think that they are being exposed to harmful levels of the active ingredient of the spray. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the levels of odour generated during the application of several common herbicides, the level of exposure of the general public when the odours are detected, and the potential risk of adverse health effects resulting from that exposure. In addition, the hypothesis that the majority of the odour associated with many agrichemicals is due to manufacturing impurities and/or additives in the commercial formulations was tested. Commercial formulations of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic (2, 4 -D) acid in the form of the butyl ester (2, 4 -D butyl ester), ethylhexyl ester (2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester) and triethanolamine salt (2, 4 -D amine) were studied because of current concerns regarding their use. A common alternative, 4 -methyl- 2 -chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) was also studied. A commercial formulation of 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester was used to test the hypothesis that the majority of the odour associated with many agrichemicals is due to manufacturing impurities and/or additives. Using dynamic dilution olfactometry, pure 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester was determined to be odourless. 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, which has an intense odour, was identified as a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>impurity</b> in the formulation. An estimate of its odour threshold (1. 95 ppb) was measured using the technique of dynamic dilution olfactometry. Other significant odorants in the formulation were iso-octanol and an aromatic solvent. The aromatic solvent is responsible for the majority of the odour associated with the 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester formulation, assuming no significant masking or synergistic effects between the odorants. The odour concentrations generated from the spraying of the herbicides under simulated aerial application conditions were measured using dynamic dilution olfactometry. The mean odour concentrations for 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester (22, 350 OUc/m³) and MCPA (23, 400 OUc/m³) were about 2 -fold higher than the values for 2, 4 -D butyl ester (12, 070 OUc/m³) and 2, 4 -D amine (10, 000 OUc/m³). Chemical analysis of the odours determined that the calculated level of airborne active ingredient when the odour of each herbicide was "just detectable" (the odour threshold) were all lower than 0. 2 µg/m³. The calculated odour safety factor between the concentration of active ingredient at the odour threshold for each herbicide and its Threshold Limit Value - Time Weighted Average were all high and of a similar magnitude, ranging from 58, 100 for 2, 4 -D butyl ester to 80, 600 for MCPA. It was concluded that detection of faint or even strong odours from the herbicides as a result of spray drift will not result in exposures of toxicological significance to members of the public. kilometres.

40|$|Quantum key {{distribution}} {{a process that}} encodes digital information often utilises fibre optic technologies for commercial applications. Fibre provides {{the benefit of a}} dark channel as well as the convenience of independence of a line-of-sight connection between the sender and receiver. In order to implement quantum {{key distribution}} protocols utilising polarisation encoding, the birefringence effects of fibre must be compensated for. Birefringence is caused by <b>manufacturing</b> <b>impurities</b> in the fibre or a change in environmental conditions and results in a rotation of the state of polarisation of light as it is propagated through the fibre. With dynamic environmental conditions, the birefringence effects should be monitored with a test signal at regular time intervals so that the polarisation of each photon can be appropriately compensated to its original state. Orthogonal states are compensated simultaneously, but most protocols, such as BB 84 and B 92, require non-orthogonal basis sets. Instead of using a compensator for each basis, the presented scheme fixes the polarisation controller onto the plane on the Poincar that passes through both bases, compensating both non-orthogonal bases simultaneously...|$|R

40|$|Today {{the vast}} {{majority}} of telecommunication and Internet messages are sent along fiber optic cables buried underground. Binary data (encoded as a sequence of pulses of light) may travel thousands of kilometers to reach its final destination. The fibers that are used for this data transfer necessarily contain <b>manufacturing</b> <b>impurities</b> that lead to fast and slow polarization states for the propagating signal. This imperfection in the fiber results in a random distortion effect known as polarization-mode dispersion (PMD). As binary data travels along these fibers, the pulses spread, causing the ones to decrease in value and the zeros to increase. Thus, the received message may contain errors. To decrease the likelihood of errors in the received signal, a device known as a compensator can be placed at the receiver. Determining an optimal setting for the compensator involves rotating the fiber in the compensator to best align its slow axis with the fast axis of the transmission fiber. Such a rotation should cancel out some of the effects of PMD. Modeling this system numerically requires that one generate fiber realizations with large amounts of PMD. To measure rotation angle goodness of fit between compensation and transmission fiber requires that one choose a feedback signal for the compensator. We compare the eye opening, spectral line, and degree of polarization ellipsoid feedback signals. While the eye opening feedback mechanism is the most accurate measure, it is difficult to optimize numerically. The degree of polarization and spectral line feedback signals act as smooth surrogates for the eye...|$|R
40|$|Chlorinated {{pesticides}} {{can contain}} impurities of dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), and their precursors, {{as a result}} of various manufacturing processes and conditions. As precursor formation of PCDD/Fs can also be mediated by ultraviolet light (UV), this study investigated whether PCDD/Fs are formed when currently used pesticides are exposed to natural sunlight. Formulations containing pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB; n = 2) and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D; n = 1) were exposed to sunlight in quartz tubes, and the concentration of 93 PCDD/F congeners were monitored over time. Considerable formation of PCDD/Fs was observed in both PCNB formulations (by up to 5600 %, to a maximum concentration of 57000 mu g Sigma PCDD/F kg(- 1)) as well as the 2, 4 -D formulation (by 3000 %, to 140 mu g Sigma PCDD/F kg(- 1)). TEQ also increased by up to 980 %, to a maximum concentration of 28 mu g kg(- 1) in PCNB, but did not change in the 2, 4 -D formulation. Assuming similar yields as observed in the present study as a worst case scenario the use of PCNB in Australia may result in the formation of 155 g TEQ annum(- 1), contributed primarily by OCDD formation. This warrants detailed evaluations on the contemporary release of PCDD/Fs to the environment after the use of pesticides. Changes in congener profiles (including the ratio of PCDDs to PCDFs (DF ratio)) suggest that pesticide sources of PCDD/Fs after sunlight exposure may not be recognized based on matching source fingerprints established from <b>manufacturing</b> <b>impurities.</b> These changes also provide preliminary insights into the possible formation routes and types of precursors involved.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the status of}} research being performed under CRADA No. SC 10 / 01771. 00 (Lead/Carbon Functionality in VRLA Batteries) between Sandia National Laboratories and East Penn Manufacturing, conducted for the U. S. Department of Energy's Energy Storage Systems Program. The Quarter 1 Milestone was completed on time. The milestone entails conducting a thorough literature review to establish {{the current level of}} understanding of the mechanisms through which carbon additions to the negative active material improve valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries. Most studies have entailed phenomenological research observing that the carbon additions prevent/reduce sulfation of the negative electrode; however, no understanding is available to provide insight into why certain carbons are successful while others are not. Impurities were implicated in one recent review of the electrochemical behavior of carbon additions. Four carbon samples have been received from East Penn <b>Manufacturing</b> and <b>impurity</b> contents have been analyzed. Carbon has been explored as an addition to lead-acid battery electrodes in a number of ways. Perhaps the most notable to date has been the hybrid 'Ultrabattery' developed by CSIRO where an asymmetric carbon-based electrochemical capacitor is combined with a lead-acid battery into a single cell, dramatically improving high-rate partial-state-of-charge (HRPSoC) operation. As illustrated below, the 'Ultrabattery' is a hybrid device constructed using a traditional lead-acid battery positive plate (i. e., PbO{sub 2 }) and a negative electrode consisting of a carbon electrode in parallel with a lead-acid negative plate. This device exhibits a dramatically improved cycle life over traditional VRLA batteries, as well as increased charge power and charge acceptance. The 'Ultrabattery' has been produced successfully by both The Furukawa Battery Co. and East Penn Manufacturing. An example illustrating the dramatic improvement in cycle life of the Ultrabattery over a conventional VRLA battery is shown in the graph...|$|R
40|$|Therapeutic {{proteins}} {{can contain}} multiple impurities, {{some of which}} are variants of the prod-uct, while others are derived from the cell substrate and the <b>manufacturing</b> process. Such <b>impurities,</b> even when present at trace levels, have the potential to activate innate immune cells in peripheral blood or embedded in tissues causing expression of cytokines and che-mokines, increasing antigen uptake, facilitating processing and presentation by antigen pre-senting cells, and fostering product immunogenicity. Currently, while products are tested for host cell protein content, assays to control innate immune response modulating impurities (IIRMIs) in products are focused mainly on endotoxin and nucleic acids, however, depend-ing on the cell substrate and the manufacturing process, numerous other IIRMI could be present. In these studies we assess two approaches that allow for the detection of a broader subset of IIRMIs. In the first, we use commercial cell lines transfected with Toll like receptors (TLR) to detect receptor-specific agonists. This method is sensitive to trace levels of IIRMI and provides information of the type of IIRMIs present but is limited by the availability of sta-bly transfected cell lines and requires pre-existing knowledge of the IIRMIs likely to be pres...|$|R
