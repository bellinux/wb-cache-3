40|$|Hearing by air {{conduction}} (AC) and bone conduction (BC) {{are attributed to}} be the natural ways of stimulating the cochlea. With AC hearing, the cochlea is stimulated by air pressure variations via the ear canal, whereas with BC hearing, sound vibrations are transmitted thru the skull bone to the cochlea. Sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> are commonly rehabilitated with conventional AC hearing aids in the ear canal, but patients who are suffering from conductive or <b>mixed</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses,</b> and who are unable to use AC hearing aids, may instead use bone conduction devices (BCDs).

50|$|It is {{very common}} {{for there to be}} a large amount of {{artifact}} while using bone-conduction ABR. This is especially true at high intensities (~50 dB nHL) and at earlier waves (i.e. Wave I). To avoid stimulus artifact, it is recommended that the bone oscillator be placed high on the temporal bone and that the inverting electrode is placed on the earlobe, mastoid, or nape of the neck. Using an alternating phase stimuli should be used to reduce artifact. Since the output of most bone oscillators is around 45 to 55 dB nHL, it becomes difficult to distinguish between sensorineural or <b>mixed</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> when the losses by bone exceed this number.

Design: Virtual spatial-hearings tests (conducted unaided, via headphones) and a questionnaire were administered in five centres in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK. Correlations and stepwise linear regression models were calculated among a group of hearing-impaired listeners.

40|$|Abstract Background It is {{recognized}} {{that the size of}} tympanic membrane(TM) perforation is proportional to the magnitude of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> however, there is no clear consensus on the effect of the location (site) of the perforation on the <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Hence the study is set to investigate the relationship between the location of perforation on TM and <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Methods A cross-sectional prospective study of consecutive adult patients with perforated TM conducted in the ENT clinic of University College Hospital Ibadan between January 1 st 2005 and July 31 st 2006. Instruments used for data collection/processing include questionnaires, video and micro-otoscopy, Pure tone audiometer, image J and SPSS packages. Results Sixty-two patients (22 -males, 40 -females), aged 16 – 75 years (mean = 35. 4 +/- 4) with 77 perforated ear drums were studied and 15 (24. 2 %) had bilateral TM perforations, 21 (33. 9 %) right unilateral and 26 (41. 9 %) left unilateral. The locations of the TM perforations were 60 (77. 9 %) central, 6 (9. 6 %) antero-inferior, 4 (5. 2 %) postero-inferior, 4 (5. 2 %) antero-superior and 3 (3. 9 %) postero-superior respectively with sizes ranging from 1. 51 %– 89. 05 %, and corresponding hearing levels 30 dB – 80 dB (59 % conductive and 41 % mixed). Fifty-nine percent had pure conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and the rest <b>mixed.</b> <b>Hearing</b> <b>losses</b> (dBHL) increased with the size of perforations (P = 0. 01, r = 0. 05). Correlation of location of perforations with magnitude of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in acute TM perorations was (P = 0. 244, r = 0. 273) and for chronic perforations (p = 0. 047 & r = 0. 31).

40|$|An {{enlarged}} vestibular aqueduct (LVA) is {{a common}} congenital inner ear anomaly responsible for some unusual vestibular and audiological symptoms. Most of the cases show bilateral early onset and progressive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in children. The gross appearance on CT scan of the inner ear is generally normal. However, precise measurements of the inner ear components reveal abnormal dimensions, which {{may account for the}} accompanying auditory and vestibular dysfunction. Despite extensive studies on hearing and the vestibular apparatus, saccular function is not studied. To our knowledge this is the first report of saccular malfunction in three patients with LVA by means of vestibular evoked myogenic potentials. Conventional audiograms revealed bilateral severe sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in two patients and <b>mixed</b> type <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in one patient. Two of the patients complained about vertigo and dizziness but vestibular assessments of the patients showed normal results. The diagnosis had been made by high-resolution CT scans and MR images of the skull that showed LVA in the absence of other anomalies. The VEMP threshold measured from the ear with LVA in two patients with unilateral enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct was 75 - 80 dB nHL whereas the threshold from normal ears was 95 dB nHL. The third patient with <b>mixed</b> type <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and bilateral LVA had VEMP responses despite a big air-bone gap in the low frequency range. The VEMP in this patient was greater in amplitude and lower in threshold in the operated ear (the patient had a tympanoplasty which did not improve her hearing). These findings and results of other patients with Tullio phenomenon and superior semicircular canal dehiscence, who also showed lower VEMP threshold, confirmed the theory of a 'third window' that allows volume and pressure displacements, and thus larger deflection of the vestibular sensors, which would cause the vestibular organ to be more responsive to sound and pressure changes...|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} main types of hearing loss, {{conductive}} hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, central deafness and combinations of conductive and sensorienural hearing losses {{which is called}} <b>mixed</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> An additional problem which is increasingly recognised is auditory processing disorder {{which is not a}} hearing loss as such but a difficulty perceiving sound.|$|E
50|$|Imaging {{is usually}} not pursued in those with {{uncomplicated}} conductive hearing loss and characteristic clinical findings. Those with only conductive hearing loss are often treated medically or with surgery without imaging.

50|$|About 70% of {{individuals}} with velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS) have minor auricular malformations, or malformations of the ear. In this syndrome, the ears are typically low-set and somewhat posteriorly rotated. In addition to external malformations, individuals with VCFS are more vulnerable to otitis media {{because of the presence}} of a cleft or other form of velopharyngeal inadequacy. The hearing loss associated with VCFS is conductive when otitis media is present (Peterson-Falzone et al., 2001). There are also sporadic reports of sensorineural hearing loss and a <b>mixed</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Of individuals with VCFS who have a hearing loss, only 11% had a sensorineural loss and 5% a mixed loss (Reyes et al., 1999).|$|E

50|$|An {{audiogram}} is {{the result}} of a hearing test. The most common type of hearing test is pure tone audiometry (PTA). It charts the thresholds of hearing sensitivity at a selection of standard frequencies between 250 and 8000 Hz. There is also high frequency pure tone audiometry which tests frequencies from 8000-20,000 Hz. PTA can be used to differentiate between conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss and <b>mixed</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> A hearing loss can be described by its degree i.e. mild, moderate, severe or profound, or by its shape i.e. high frequency or sloping, low frequency or rising, notched, U-shaped or 'cookie-bite', peaked or flat.|$|E
50|$|Hearing loss may {{be caused}} by a number of factors, including: genetics, ageing, {{exposure}} to noise, some infections, birth complications, trauma to the ear, and certain medications or toxins. A common condition that results in hearing loss is chronic ear infections. Certain infections during pregnancy such as syphilis and rubella may also cause hearing loss. Hearing loss is diagnosed when hearing testing finds that a person is unable to hear 25 decibels in at least one ear. Testing for poor hearing is recommended for all newborns. Hearing loss can be categorised as mild, moderate, moderate-severe, severe, or profound. There are three main types of hearing loss, conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and <b>mixed</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
50|$|Individuals with Nager {{syndrome}} {{typically have}} the malformations of the auricle, external auditory canal, and middle ear, including the ossicles. These malformations {{were found in}} 80% of individuals with Nager syndrome. Inner ear malformations, however, are not typically seen in this population. Middle ear disease is common among individuals with Nager syndrome. Chronic otitis media and Eustachian tube deformity can result in conductive hearing loss. For this reason, early detection and treatment for middle ear disease is crucial in this population. Sensorineural hearing loss is not a typical characteristic of Nager syndrome; however, a subset of individuals present with a <b>mixed</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> due to a progressive sensorineural component combined with the typical conductive hearing loss (Herrman et al., 2005).|$|E
40|$|Patients: Thirty-eight adult {{subjects}} {{fitted with}} unilateral bone-anchored hearing device. Interventions: Audiometric measurements included sound-field pure-tone and speech audiometries (speech reception threshold, maximum speech discrimination). Subjective benefit {{was assessed by}} the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire. Ipsilateral and contralateral <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was considered. Comparison was drawn between Compact, Divino, and Intenso processors. Main Outcome: To compare sound-field pure-tone and speech audiometries and APHAB results with and without the device adjusted for the unaided results. Results: With the device, sound-field pure-tone audiometry results revealed an increase gain in all frequencies. Sound-field speech audiometry showed that the mean threshold of speech recognition was 20 dB lower, maximum discrimination was attained at 5 dB less, and percentage of maximum discrimina-tion increased by 5 %. Scores in the APHAB questionnaire decreased except for the aversiveness subscale. Auditory-adjusted gain showed greater benefit in subjects with ipsilateral conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Subjects with contralateral normal hearing or conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> showed greater improvement that those with con-tralateral <b>mixed</b> or sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> There were no differences between Compact, Divino and Intenso processors. Conclusion: When comparisons are adjusted for unaided con-dition, the bone-anchored hearing device provided auditory and subjective benefit in subjects with ipsilateral conductive hear-ing loss and contralateral normal hearing or conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> It gave marginal benefit in ipsilateral mixed and contra-lateral <b>mixed</b> or sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> No {{differences were found between}} the Compact, Intenso, and Divino processors...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Active {{middle ear}} {{implants}} augment hearing {{in patients with}} sensorineural, conductive, and <b>mixed</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> with great success. However, the application of active middle ear implants has been restricted to compromised ears in adults only. Recently, active middle ear implants have been successfully implanted in patients younger than 18 years of age with all types of <b>hearing</b> <b>losses.</b> The Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) active middle ear implant has been implanted in more than 60 children and adolescents worldwide {{by the end of}} 2008. In October 2008, experts from the field with experience in this population met to discuss VSB implantation in patients below the age of 18. METHODS: A consensus meeting was organized including a presentation session of cases from worldwide centers and a discussion session in which implantation, precautions, and alternative means of hearing augmentation were discussed. At the end of the meeting, a consensus statement was written by the participating experts. The present consensus paper describes the outcomes and medical/surgical complications: the outcomes are favourable in terms of hearing thresholds, speech intelligibility in quiet and in noise, with a low incidence of intra- and postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the VSB offers another viable treatment for children and adolescents with compromised hearing. However, other treatment options should also be taken into consideration. The advantages and disadvantages of all possible treatment options should be weighed against each other in the light of each individual case to provide the best solution; counseling should include a. o. surgical issues and MRI compatibility...|$|R

50|$|Most {{forms of}} nonsyndromic {{deafness}} {{are associated with}} permanent hearing loss caused by damage to structures in the inner ear. The inner ear consists of three parts: a snail-shaped structure called the cochlea that helps process sound, nerves that send information from the cochlea to the brain, and structures involved with balance. Loss of hearing caused by changes in the inner ear is called sensorineural deafness. Hearing loss that results from changes in the middle ear is called conductive hearing loss.

40|$|Hypothesis:The {{transcutaneous}} {{bone conduction}} implant (BCI) is compared with bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs) under {{the hypothesis that}} the BCI can give similar rehabilitation from an audiological as well as patient-related point of view. Background:Patients suffering from conductive and <b>mixed</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> can often benefit more from rehabilitation using bone conduction devices (BCDs) rather than conventional air conduction devices. The most widely used BCD is the percutaneous BAHA, with a permanent skin-penetrating abutment. To overcome issues related to percutaneous BCDs, the trend today is to develop transcutaneous devices, with intact skin. The BCI is an active transcutaneous device currently in a clinical trial phase. A potential limitation of active transcutaneous devices is the loss of power in the induction link over the skin. To address this issue, countermeasures are taken {{in the design of the}} BCI, which is therefore expected to be as effective as percutaneous BCDs. Methods:An early observational study with a matched-pair design was performed to compare BCI and BAHA groups of patients over several audiometric measurements, including speech audiometry and warble tones thresholds with and without the device. Additionally, questionnaires were used to assess the general health condition, benefit, and satisfaction level of patients. Results:No statistically significant difference was detected in any of the audiological measurements. The outcome of patient-related measurements was slightly superior for BCI in all subscales. Conclusion:Results confirm the initial hypothesis of the study: the BCI seems to be capable of providing as good rehabilitation as percutaneous devices for indicated patients...|$|R

Among those with incipient NIHL, 13. 9 % were bilateral, 19. 4 % were only in the right ear and 66. 7 % were only in the left ear. CONCLUSION: Abnormal audiograms were found in 48. 0 % of the sample. Among those with <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> the predominant cause was NIHL, followed by those classified as having incipient noise induced <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> usually started at 6 kHz, frequently in the left ear...|$|R
40|$|HYPOTHESIS: The {{transcutaneous}} {{bone conduction}} implant (BCI) is compared with bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs) under {{the hypothesis that}} the BCI can give similar rehabilitation from an audiological as well as patient-related point of view. BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from conductive and <b>mixed</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> can often benefit more from rehabilitation using bone conduction devices (BCDs) rather than conventional air conduction devices. The most widely used BCD is the percutaneous BAHA, with a permanent skin-penetrating abutment. To overcome issues related to percutaneous BCDs, the trend today is to develop transcutaneous devices, with intact skin. The BCI is an active transcutaneous device currently in a clinical trial phase. A potential limitation of active transcutaneous devices is the loss of power in the induction link over the skin. To address this issue, countermeasures are taken {{in the design of the}} BCI, which is therefore expected to be as effective as percutaneous BCDs. METHODS: An early observational study with a matched-pair design was performed to compare BCI and BAHA groups of patients over several audiometric measurements, including speech audiometry and warble tones thresholds with and without the device. Additionally, questionnaires were used to assess the general health condition, benefit, and satisfaction level of patients. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was detected in any of the audiological measurements. The outcome of patient-related measurements was slightly superior for BCI in all subscales. CONCLUSION: Results confirm the initial hypothesis of the study: the BCI seems to be capable of providing as good rehabilitation as percutaneous devices for indicated patients...|$|R
