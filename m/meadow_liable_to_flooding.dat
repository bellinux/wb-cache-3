50|$|The Alsatian ried {{consists}} of <b>meadows</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding,</b> and of gallery forests,the vegetation {{of which is}} lush. The ried was formed by the then meandering Rhine,before it was canalised.The Petit Ried lies north of Strasbourg, whereas the Grand Riedlies south of Strasbourg. The town of Rhinau possesses 1000 ha of the last example of a temperategallery forest in Western Europe, which {{is located on the}} right bank of the Rhine.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} park design featured riverside plantings and rustic bridges {{over the}} Ravensbourne. Since {{the land was}} originally water <b>meadows,</b> and therefore <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding,</b> extensive work was done prior to the park’s opening and, over time, the river channel was straightened, widened and weirs added.|$|R
50|$|There is {{access to}} the reserve from the road between St Osyth and Lee Wick Farm. Some areas are <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> at high tides.|$|R
50|$|Gourie Cave {{is a large}} river cave in Manchester Parish in west-central Jamaica. At 3505 metres it is {{the longest}} cave known in the island. It is <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Macleay River is <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> in the Kempsey area, on {{occasions}} causing great damage. During {{times of}} peak flooding, the Macleay River can hold over [...] of water.|$|R
50|$|The River Camogue {{flows to}} the west of the village, {{parallel}} to the main street with the land in between <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b> It is a tributory of the River Maigue.|$|R
50|$|The monastery {{and later}} castle of Fail {{existed at the}} hamlet of that name near Fail Toll. Fail Loch once covered a {{significant}} area however it survives now only as an area <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mucanagh is <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> {{though this}} is disregarded by many locals who use {{tractors}} or four-wheel drives into {{or out of the}} townland. The dredging of the Suck in the 1970s never had the anticipated results.|$|R
50|$|The 19th century Ordnance Survey maps {{show the}} site as 'Fail Loch' and state {{that it is}} <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding,</b> and the {{drainage}} remains inadequate and the area dominated by marsh plants. Paterson records that part of Fail Loch remains in the 1860s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{course is}} {{situated}} {{on the western side}} of the heath bordered to the west by Donkey Wood and the River Crane. Part of the course adjacent to the river is <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b> Access is from the [...] A315 Staines Road.|$|R
30|$|The hedonic {{pricing model}} has {{potential}} in evaluating regulating services, {{for example in}} terms of the price discount on houses <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b> However, it does not offer a direct valuation of forests' role in ameliorating <b>floods.</b> <b>To</b> achieve this requires further investigation, using approaches outlined in the section on financial costs.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{original}} vegetation {{of the city was}} devastated. Like 13 other municipalities in the metropolitan region of Campinas, the city is subject to severe environmental stress, and Campinas {{is considered one of the}} areas <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> and silting; it now has less than 5% of vegetation cover.|$|R
50|$|The museum {{built up}} a {{collection}} of local archaeology and stuffed animals and also founded the Bexhill Museum Association in 1923 to oversee their work. The natural history collection was not well preserved as the temperature and light levels were difficult to control and the basement was <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flood.</b>|$|R
500|$|The town {{itself is}} built on the Giessen {{alluvial}} fan so it is slightly higher {{than the rest of}} the Alsace plains. Much of its territory is however located on areas <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b> Such areas are mostly located inside the Illwald natural reserve and comprise both forests and meadows. There the Ill forms more than [...] of waterways.|$|R
3000|$|Collinearity between {{attributes}} {{is also a}} problem. For example, houses {{benefiting from}} views over a river (positively valued) may also be more <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> (negatively valued). Obversely, the tendency of good views and appropriate tree planting to attract wealthy purchasers creates a [...] "good neighbourhood" [...] effect that spuriously enhances the derived good-view premium (Price, 1995).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{show how}} the {{methodology}} based on the Source-Pathway-Receptor-Consequence (SPRC) approach {{can be used to}} identify the risks of flooding and erosion. The methodology is applied to the Teign Estuary in Devon, UK to define the linkages between physical loads (waves, tides), sea defences, areas <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> and the impacts of flooding...|$|R
50|$|Wetherby Ings are water meadows, by the River Wharfe {{now used}} as parkland in Wetherby, West Yorkshire, England. The ings {{on the north}} and south bank are used as parkland and for sports grounds for the town's {{football}} and rugby league teams. The area is <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> during heavy rain and the river has broken its banks frequently.|$|R
50|$|The Reichswald Forest lies in Germany, to {{the east}} of Nijmegen and between the Rivers Rhine and Maas. The area is wooded and <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b> In 1945, the winter had been wet and the German {{defenders}} had allowed the rivers <b>to</b> <b>flood,</b> thus negating the Allied advantages in armour and manpower. They had also had some weeks to prepare their defences and towns had been turned into fortresses.|$|R
50|$|The Church, {{dedicated}} to Edward the Confessor, was {{built as a}} chapel of ease by the Lord of the Manor and major landowner, William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp, because St Mary's {{was too far away}} from the main centres of population in the parish and <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b> St Edward’s became the Parish Church in 1975 following the redundancy of St Mary’s.|$|R
50|$|The town {{itself is}} built on the Giessen {{alluvial}} fan so it is slightly higher {{than the rest of}} the Alsace plains. Much of its territory is however located on areas <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b> Such areas are mostly located inside the Illwald natural reserve and comprise both forests and meadows. There the Ill forms more than 150 km of waterways.|$|R
50|$|The {{territory}} of the municipality is partially <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding,</b> when {{the level of the}} Lez rises. Areas near the river Lez and the river were protected by dykes. An environmental inspection report pointed the risk of three hundred dead in Lattes-Centre and other localities like les Marestelles and the necessity to provide accommodation. A spillway has been built in 2010.|$|R
50|$|Topham is a rural hamlet on the River Went, a {{tributary}} of the River Don; alongside a dismantled railway. Also, because of its situation on the river; it is <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b> It is located at approximately , at an elevation of around 5 metres above sea level. The area around Topham is extremely flat with very few hills or inclines.|$|R
5|$|Somerset {{is largely}} rural {{and the two}} main centres of population, Bath and Weston-super-Mare, were {{transferred}} to the unitary authority districts of Bath and North East Somerset and North Somerset respectively, in 1996 but are still part of the ceremonial county. The Somerset Levels are <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> and the only significant towns are Glastonbury and Street which occupy slightly elevated locations on the Polden Hills.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1970s the Fawcett Society {{found it}} {{increasingly}} difficult to maintain the library. In 1977 it was taken over by the City of London Polytechnic, which in 1992 became London Guildhall University. The library subsequently spent nearly 25 years in a cramped basement increasingly <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding,</b> while increasing considerably its stock, its user base and its contacts with other such resources both nationally and internationally.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s, this {{martin was}} caught and eaten in large {{quantities}} in the DRC by the local population, and this practice could be increasing. The African river martins and the bee-eaters with which they share their colonies are dug out of the breeding burrows for food. Breeding colonies in river sandbars are <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding,</b> but thousands of birds were breeding on the grasslands east of Gamba as recently as 2005.|$|R
50|$|When {{leaving the}} {{telephone}} exchange, the ISDN30 cable can {{be buried in}} the ground, usually in ducting, at very little depth. This makes any business telephone lines vulnerable to being dug up during streetworks, <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> during heavy storms, and effectively subject to general wear and tear due to all manner of natural hazards. Loss, therefore, of the 'last mile' link, means the non-delivery of calls, and other data, to the business affected.|$|R
5|$|On- and off-ramps project northward from Eastern Avenue, each {{adding a}} lane to both carriageways. The {{expressway}} continues northward, with the Don River sandwiched between {{the highway and}} Bayview Avenue. The Parkway passes beneath Dundas and Gerrard Streets and rises onto the 'Don Flats' plateau at Riverdale Park. In this section, the elevation of the highway {{is close to the}} level of the river and is <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flood</b> after heavy rains, as occurred in June 2010, for example.|$|R
50|$|A grotto (Italian grotta and French grotte) is {{a natural}} or {{artificial}} cave used by humans in both modern times and antiquity, and historically or prehistorically. Naturally occurring grottoes are often small caves near water that are usually <b>flooded</b> or <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flood</b> at high tide. Sometimes, artificial grottoes are used as garden features. The Grotta Azzurra at Capri and the grotto at the villa of Tiberius in the Bay of Naples are examples of popular natural seashore grottoes.|$|R
50|$|Eddleston Water rises near Mount Lothian {{and passes}} through Waterheads, Eddleston, Milkieston, Redscarhead {{along the route}} of the A703. It runs passing Dundee and Dalatho into Peebles where the Tree Bridge crosses it. When the Edinburgh to Peebles railway was built {{in the middle of the}} 19th century the river was {{straightened}} for much of its course which adversely affected the wildlife habitat and increased the speed of flow. As a result, the river is <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b>|$|R
50|$|Coe Fen and Sheep's Green form {{a natural}} {{area that was}} once {{important}} for the commercial activity of Cambridge.There were up to three watermills in the area. The land between the artificially raised banks of the watercourses was <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> and thus only suitable for grazing (cows on Coe Fen, sheep on Sheep's Green, hence the names). By the 19th century, the fen had become very boggy and was partially drained to help avoid disease. Today, the land is a semi-natural area.|$|R
50|$|The Ramsar site {{comprises}} the Kooragang Nature Reserve {{and the nearby}} Shortland Wetlands, which are connected by a wildlife corridor that includes the Hunter River and Ironbark Creek. Kooragang Island is an artificial, estuarine island <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> at high tide. Its habitats include mangroves, brackish and freshwater swamps, saltmarsh, Casuarina forest, mudflats, beaches and rock walls. The site is important for migratory waders and the mangroves are important for fish. Surrounding areas are used for livestock grazing and heavy industry.|$|R
50|$|The site is an {{alluvial}} meadow {{next to the}} River Ray in the Vale of Aylesbury. It has clay soil and is <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding.</b> A regime of a hay cut followed by cattle grazing, {{without the use of}} artificial fertilisers, has resulted in a diverse grassland habitat now rare in England. Herbs include meadow buttercup, lesser knapweed and devil's bit scabious. Ditches and the riverbank provide a permanently wet habitat, encouraging wading birds such as snipe and curlew. Invertebrates include damselflies.|$|R
5000|$|When {{leaving the}} {{telephone}} exchange, the ISDN30 cable can {{be buried in}} the ground, usually in ducting, at very little depth. This makes any business telephone lines vulnerable to being dug up during streetworks, <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> during heavy storms and general wear and tear due to natural elements. Loss, therefore, of the [...] "last mile" [...] will cause the failure to deliver any calls to the business affected. Business continuity planning often provides {{for this type of}} technical failure.|$|R
5000|$|The toponym {{is said to}} {{come from}} [...] "Marsh-town", because of the low-lying nature of the land, still green space, near the River Cherwell, which in earlier times was <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> {{frequent}} <b>flooding.</b>|$|R
50|$|Evesham {{is derived}} from the Old English homme or ham, and Eof, the name of a swineherd in the service of Egwin, third bishop of Worcester. It was {{originally}} named Homme or Haum and recorded as Eveshomme in 709 and Evesham in 1086. The second part of the name (homme or ham) typically only signifies a home or dwelling, but in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire was commonly applied to land on the sides of a river, generally in bends of a river, which were <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flood.</b>|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the determination of}} the boundary of the land <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding</b> (on a 1 : 25, 000 scale topographical map), on the Coomalie Creek floodplain lying within the administrative area of the Coomalie Community Oovernment Council. The 1 in 100 Annual Exceedence Probability (AEP) flood discharge of Coomalie Creek at the Stuart Highway Crossing 08170066 was determined by frequency analysis of annual flood maxima at 08170066. Frequency analysis was shown to produce a more accurate estimate of the 1 in 100 AEP flood discharge at 08170066 than a rainfall runoff model The 1 in 100 AEP flood level at Coomalie Creek/Stuart Highway crossing was then determined from the extended rating curve. The I in 100 AEP flood discharge of Coomalie Creek was also estimated at a surveyed river section 7 kilometres upstream of 08170066, using the RORE model with a regional value for the RORE parameter. The I in 100 AEP flood level at this section was then determined from Manning's formula The boundary of the land <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>flooding,</b> east of Batchelor on the Coomalie Creek floodplain, and immediatly downstream of the Coomalie Creek/Stuart Highway crossing was found by assuming an uniform flood slope. This slope was computed from the estimated I i...|$|R
