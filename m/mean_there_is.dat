5|$|Major {{declines in}} populations have been {{observed}} from 1980 onward in Sweden, Finland, northern Russia (Karelia) and the Baltic States, and smaller declines {{in much of the}} rest of northern and central Europe. The bird has been adversely affected in these areas by intensive agriculture, and in several countries it has been red-listed due to population declines of more than 50%. Numbers dwindled in the United Kingdom by more than 80% between 1966 and 2004; although populations in some areas such as Northern Ireland were stable or even increased, those in other areas, mainly England, declined even more sharply. The overall decline seems to be due to the low survival rate of young birds, which may be caused by changes in agricultural practices. The intensive farming methods used in northern Europe <b>mean</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> less pasture and meadow habitat available, and the supply of grassland invertebrates needed for the nestlings to thrive is correspondingly reduced.|$|E
25|$|Pakistani food {{makes use}} of fresh hand-pounded masalas, unlike the dried herbs and powders {{that are used in}} Indian cooking. Ghee is used, but the main {{component}} of the meal or a dish is meat (beef, lamb, chicken, goat, or fish), and vegetables are sparingly used. Surprisingly, Pakistani food also makes extensive use of olive oil. Sparingly used vegetables does not <b>mean</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no vegetarian food on the menu. Since the cuisine is very similar to Punjabi-style of cooking, tikka, simmered dals, tawa sabzi, and chaat feature here.|$|E
25|$|Common allergens include pollen {{and certain}} food. Metals and other {{substances}} may also cause problems. Food, insect stings, and medications are common causes of severe reactions. Their development {{is due to}} both genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE), part of the body's immune system, binding to an allergen {{and then to a}} receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine. Diagnosis is typically based on a person's medical history. Further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases. Positive tests, however, may not <b>mean</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a significant allergy to the substance in question.|$|E

25|$|A {{system of}} initialisms has evolved to {{describe}} the variety of group sex arrangements. These codes can appear in erotic literature and film descriptions, member profiles in online communities, and personal ads. These codes consist of arrangements of the letters M (for male) and F (for female). Adjacent letters are sometimes used to signify sexual contact between the participants represented by those letters, though this does not necessarily <b>mean</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no contact between the other participants. For example, MMF would signify a ménage à trois of two men and one woman in which the center male has sexual contact with the other male and the female, and {{in which it is}} not specified whether there is contact between the female and the other male. MFMF (situation pictured in photo to right), on the other hand, implies no same-sex contact.|$|E

2500|$|An off spin bowler will bowl mostly off breaks, varying them by {{adjusting}} the line and length of the deliveries. Off breaks {{are considered to be}} one of the easier spin deliveries for a right-handed batsman to play. This is because the ball moves in towards the batsman's body, meaning the batsman's legs are usually in the path of the ball if it misses the bat or takes an edge. This makes it difficult for the bowler to get the batsman out bowled or caught from an off break, but it does <b>mean</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a chance of leg before wicket, assuming the ball has not turned enough to miss the leg stump.|$|E

2500|$|Bayesian {{probability}} {{is often}} {{found to be}} difficult when analysing and assessing probabilities due to its initial counter intuitive nature. Often when deciding between strategies based on a decision, they are interpreted as: [...] where there is evidence X that shows condition A might hold true, is misread by judging A’s likelihood by how well the evidence X matches A, but crucially without considering the prior frequency of A.

2500|$|Eating or {{drinking}} during labour {{is an area}} of ongoing debate. While some have argued that eating in labour has no harmful effects on outcomes, others continue to have concern regarding the increased possibility of an aspiration event (choking on recently eaten foods) {{in the event of an}} emergency delivery due to the increased relaxation of the esophagus in pregnancy, upward pressure of the uterus on the stomach, and the possibility of general anesthetic in the event of an emergency cesarean. A 2013 Cochrane review found that with good obstetrical anaesthesia there is no change in harms from allowing eating and drinking during labour in those who are unlikely to need surgery. They additionally acknowledge that not eating does not <b>mean</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an empty stomach or that its contents are not as acidic. They therefore conclude that [...] "women should be free to eat and drink in labour, or not, as they wish." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1983 Dahl {{reviewed}} Tony Clifton's God Cried, {{a picture}} {{book about the}} siege of West Beirut by the Israeli army during the 1982 Lebanon War.

[...] Dahl told a reporter in 1983, [...] "There's a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity ... I <b>mean</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> always a reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didn't just pick on them for no reason." [...] Dahl maintained friendships {{with a number of}} Jews, including philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin, who said, [...] "I thought he might say anything. Could have been pro-Arab or pro-Jew. There was no consistent line. He was a man who followed whims, which meant he would blow up in one direction, so to speak." [...] Amelia Foster, director of the Roald Dahl Museum in Great Missenden, states, [...] "This is again an example of how Dahl refused to take anything seriously, even himself. He was very angry at the Israelis. He had a childish reaction {{to what was going on}} in Israel. Dahl wanted to provoke, as he always provoked at dinner.

2500|$|A related {{doctrine}} is [...] "common mistake", which since {{the decision of}} Lord Phillips MR in The Great Peace {{is essentially the same}} in operation as frustration, except that the event making a contract impossible to perform takes place before, not after, a contract is concluded. A [...] "common mistake" [...] differs from the [...] "mistakes" [...] that take place between offers and acceptance (that <b>mean</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no agreement in the first place), or the so-called [...] "mistake about identity" [...] cases that follow from a fraudulent misrepresentation (which typically makes a contract voidable, not void, unless in a written document and concluded at a distance), because it is based on performance becoming seriously difficult to perform. For instance, in Courturier v Hastie a corn shipment had decayed by the time two businesspeople had contracted for it, and so it was held (perhaps controversially) that the seller was not liable, because it was always physically impossible. And in Cooper v Phibbs the House of Lords held that an agreement to lease out a fishery was void because it turned out the lessee was in fact the owner. It is legally impossible to be leased something one owns. Again, the doctrine of common mistake may be contracted around, so in McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission it was held that despite the fact that a wrecked ship off the Great Barrier Reef never in fact existed, because a salvage business was actually promised by the Australian government that it was there, there was no common mistake. Like frustration, the doctrine operates only in narrow confines. In Bell v Lever Bros Ltd Lord Atkin stated that a mistake must be of such a 'fundamental character as to constitute an underlying assumption without which the parties would not have entered into the agreements'. Post-war, Denning LJ added to the doctrine, beyond its narrow legal confines, in line with the more permissive approach recognised throughout civil law countries, most of the Commonwealth and the United States. In Solle v Butcher he held that in equity a contract could be deemed voidable (rather than outright void) if it would be 'unconscientious' for a court to hold someone to a bargain. This gave the courts some flexibility in the kind of remedy they would grant, and could be more generous in the circumstances they allowed escape. But in The Great Peace, Lord Phillips MR said that this more permissive doctrine had been contrary to the House of Lords authority in Bell v Lever Bros Ltd. Although it probably would not have been avoidable under the mistake in equity doctrine anyway, Lord Phillips MR held that a rescue company could not escape from an agreement to save a ship because both parties were mistaken that the distressed vessel was further than they originally thought. The result is that English contract law jealously prevents escape from an agreement, unless there is a serious breach because of the conduct of one party, which gives rise to the right to terminate.|$|E
