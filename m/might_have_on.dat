5|$|In early November 2010 the United States {{launched}} QE2, {{the second}} round of quantitative easing, which had been expected. The Federal Reserve made an additional $600 billion available for the purchase of financial assets. This prompted widespread criticism from China, Germany, and Brazil that the United States was using QE2 to try to devalue its currency without consideration to the effect the resulting capital inflows <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> emerging economies.|$|E

He was, of course, proven correct.|$|E
25|$|Under Zhou, Communist {{businessmen}} {{made great}} profits engaging in currency trading and commodity speculation, {{especially in the}} international markets for American dollars and gold. Zhou's most lucrative business was generated by several opium plantations that Zhou established in remote areas. Although the CCP had been engaged in the eradication of opium smoking since its establishment, Zhou justified opium production and distribution in KMT-controlled areas by the huge profits generated for the CCP, and by the debilitating effects that opium addiction <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> KMT soldiers and government officials.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have been found to}} be effective in preventing SIDS including changing the sleeping position, breastfeeding, limiting soft bedding, immunizing the infant and using pacifiers. The use of electronic monitors has not been found to be useful as a preventative strategy. The effect that fans <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> the risk of SIDS has not been studied well enough to make any recommendation about them. Evidence regarding swaddling is unclear regarding SIDS. A 2016 review found tentative evidence that swaddling increases risk of SIDS, especially among babies placed on their stomachs or side while sleeping.|$|E

25|$|As reports came in of {{the devastation}} caused by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Attlee {{considered}} how nuclear weapons had {{changed the nature of}} warfare and international relations. He raised the matter with the Gen 75 Committee, and Bevin suggested that a first step should be a letter to Truman suggesting a review of policy. The letter was sent to Truman on 20 September 1945. A response was slow in coming; Truman was concerned about the effect that Anglo-American and Canadian talks <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> the Soviet Union. At Attlee's insistence, talks were scheduled for 9 November 1945.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, {{three of}} Presley's bodyguards were fired {{and decided to}} write a tell-all book about their life in his inner circle. Worried about the impact such details <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> his career, Presley, through his father, asked Parker to stop the {{publication}} of the book. Parker made attempts to have it stopped, but failed to do so. According to Presley's friend, Larry Geller, Parker secretly wanted the book to be published, hoping that it would open Presley's eyes to how bad he had gotten and persuade him to do something about it. The book would eventually be published in August 1977, two weeks before Presley's death.|$|E
25|$|Many {{refugees}} from North Korea {{have complained that}} they find integration into South Korean society to be difficult; they say they often face social ostracism and a government that would rather they keep quiet about the human rights situation in the North. The government has taken major steps to minimize the impact the refugees <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> its policy towards the North. An Internet radio station operated by refugees, broadcasting for those living in the North, was subject to a campaign of harassment that ended in it being unable to afford its rent after less than one month of operation. The station accused the government of either being behind the campaign or tacitly encouraging it. The government also blocked activists from sending radios to the North, and a scuffle reportedly left activist Norbert Vollertsen injured.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Ukraine inaugurated {{work on the}} Bistroe Channel {{that would}} provide an {{additional}} navigable link from the Black Sea to the populous Ukrainian section of the Danube Delta. However, because of the negative impact which this new channel <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> the fragile ecosystem of the delta, the European Union advised Ukraine {{to shut down the}} works. Romanian officials threatened to sue Ukraine at the International Court of Justice. Under the presidency of Kuchma, Ukraine had responded that Romania was only afraid of the competition that the new channel would bring, and continued working on the channel. Under the presidency of Yuschenko, who visited Romania in 2005, both sides agree that professionals should decide the fate of the channel. In the long run, Ukraine plans to build a navigation channel, if not through Bistroe Channel, then through another channel.|$|E
25|$|At {{one time}} {{it was said that}} {{appearing}} as a Bond girl would damage an actress's career. Lois Chiles is often cited as a case in point, even though her career did not suffer because of her portrayal of Holly Goodhead, but rather because, after she lost her younger brother to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, she decided to take a three-year break from acting, from which her career never recovered. Casting for the female lead in Casino Royale (2006) was hindered by potential actresses' concerns about the effect that playing the role <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> their careers. At that point, some thought that the Bond series had become stale and would therefore be a less desirable vehicle for young actresses. Nevertheless, the up-and-coming actress Eva Green agreed {{to play the role of}} Vesper Lynd, and showed those fears to be unfounded when she won BAFTA's Rising Star Award for her performance. Rosamund Pike, who made her feature film debut as Miranda Frost in Die Another Day (2002), went on to earn an Academy Award Nomination for Gone Girl.|$|E
25|$|In a study {{published}} in the British Journal of Cancer, which also did not find an increase in any other cancers other than Leukemia, the authors of which attempted to quantify the effect population mixing <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> the Seascale leukaemia cluster. In the analysis of childhood leukaemia/NHL in Cumbria, excluding Seascale, they noted that if both parents were born outside the Cumbrian area (incomers), there was a significantly higher rate of leukaemia/NHL in their children. 1181 children were born in the village of Seascale between 1950 and 1989, in children aged 1–14 during this period, the Seascale cluster of 6 observed cases of NHL were noted. Two similarly aged children, born between 1950 and 1989, outside Seascale were also diagnosed with ALL/NHL before the end of 1992. The origin of birth of 11 of the 16 parents of these eight children was known, and found to be; 3 had parents born outside Cumbria and 3 had one parent born outside the UK. The studies authors strongly supported the hypothesis that the risk of ALL/NHL, in particular in the younger age group, increases with increased exposure to population mixing during gestation or early in life. Although they determined that the exact mechanism by which it causes these malignancies, apart from Kinlen's infection aetiology that was mentioned, remained unknown, concluding that the possibility of additional risk factors in Seascale remains.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the Revolutionary War, in 1775, Hazen was living on half-pay in Saint-Jean. [...] When Benedict Arnold raided Fort Saint-Jean on May 18, Hazen {{reported}} the news of that raid (as well as the capture of Fort Ticonderoga) first to the military authorities in Montreal, and then to Governor Guy Carleton in Quebec, before returning home to consider the consequences the conflict <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> him and his lands.|$|E
500|$|Mayors from 14 NBA cities {{wrote an}} open letter to NBA {{commissioner}} David Stern and NBPA chief Billy Hunter, requesting that they end the lockout based on [...] "the perspective [...] residents and the negative impact a canceled season <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> them, our cities, and our local economies". Time noted that arena workers would be affected by the cancellation of games. However, separate studies by University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Lake Forest College found no historic significant effect to the economies of cities with sports franchises affected by work stoppages. Explanations included consumer shifting of spending on sporting events to other forms of entertainment, reduced local government spending on crowd and traffic control, and higher productivity by the general workforce without the distraction of games.|$|E

500|$|As the [...] presidential {{election}} of 1792 approached, Washington, {{pleased with the}} progress his administration had made in establishing a strong, stable federal government, was planning to retire rather than seek a second term. He complained of old age, sickness, the in-fighting plaguing his cabinet, and the increasing hostility of the partisan press. However, {{the members of his}} cabinet—especially Jefferson and Hamilton—worked diligently through the summer and fall to persuade Washington not to retire. They apprised him of the potential impact the French Revolutionary Wars <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> the country, and insisted that only someone with his popularity and moderation could lead the nation effectively during the volatile times ahead. In the end, [...] "Washington never announced his candidacy in the election of 1792," [...] writes historian John Ferling, [...] "he simply never said that he would not consider a second term." ...|$|E
500|$|The media {{focused on}} Häkkinen {{overtaking}} Michael Schumacher {{for the lead}} on lap 41, and after the race Häkkinen went to Schumacher in the parc fermé and {{told him not to}} make a move like that again. Zonta later said that although he was unaware of Häkkinen's presence, he saw Schumacher in his mirrors. Derick Allsop of The Independent described the impact the move <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> Häkkinen's career: [...] "Perhaps, he [...] will be recognised as a driver worthy of a place in the pantheon of the sport's heroes." [...] According to McLaren team principal Ron Dennis, [...] "His overtaking manoeuvre I'm sure will go down {{as one of the greatest}} in Formula One history", and in February 2001 Häkkinen's move was chosen by more than 60 Formula One historians as the MasterCard Priceless Moment of the 2000 F1 season.|$|E
500|$|According to an Arabic note on {{the reverse}} of {{the first volume of}} the {{manuscript}}, the manuscript was written by the hand of Thecla, the martyr, a notable lady of Egypt, a little later than the Council of Nice (A.D. 325). Tregelles made another suggestion, the New Testament volume has long been mutilated, and begins now in the twenty-fifth chapter of Matthew, in which chapter the lesson for Thecla's Day stands. [...] "We cannot be sure how the story arose. It may be that the manuscript was written in a monastery dedicated to Thecla." [...] Tregelles thought that Thecla's name <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> this account been written in the margin above, which has been cut off, and that therefore the Egyptians imagined that Thecla had written it. Cyril Lucaris believed in Thecla's authorship, but the codex cannot be older than from late 4th century.|$|E
