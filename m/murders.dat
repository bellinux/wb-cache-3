5000|$|Under {{the first}} {{representation}} it is vacuously true {{that if you}} commit a forbidden act, then you ought to commit any other act, regardless of whether that second act was obligatory, permitted or forbidden (Von Wright 1956, cited in Aqvist 1994). Under the second representation, we are vulnerable to the gentle <b>murder</b> paradox, where the plausible statements (1) if you <b>murder,</b> you ought to <b>murder</b> gently, (2) you do commit <b>murder,</b> and (3) to <b>murder</b> gently you must <b>murder</b> imply the less plausible statement: you ought to <b>murder.</b> Others argue that must in the phrase to <b>murder</b> gently you must <b>murder</b> is a mistranslation from the ambiguous English word (meaning either implies or ought). Interpreting must as implies does not allow one to conclude you ought to <b>murder</b> but only a repetition of the given you <b>murder.</b> Misinterpreting must as ought results in a perverse axiom, not a perverse logic. With use of negations one can easily check if the ambiguous word was mistranslated by considering {{which of the following}} two English statements is equivalent with the statement to <b>murder</b> gently you must murder: is it equivalent to if you <b>murder</b> gently it is forbidden not to <b>murder</b> or if you <b>murder</b> gently it is impossible not to <b>murder</b> ? ...|$|R

Mel Smith was hired to direct and filming lasted from October to December 1993.
