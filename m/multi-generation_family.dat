40|$|As family {{shareholder}} {{support is}} essential for the ongoing viability of the business as a family business, <b>multi-generation</b> <b>family</b> businesses which allow 'the ownership tree' to grow need to monitor the attitudes and expectations of the expanding number of family member shareholders. This paper reports on a case study of a <b>multi-generation</b> <b>family</b> business where the shareholder group had grown to 50 individual shareholders. The study explored the shareholders' views about the business and particularly their attitudes to stewardship and whether and under what circumstances, they would hold their shareholdings, pass them to the next generation of family or possibly consider relinquishing their holdings. Data was obtained from a semi-structured questionnaire and follow-up interviews. While respondents indicated that they had immense pride in being a shareholder of the family business, they admitted that their knowledge of that business was less than optimal. Financial returns were viewed as important, but the intangible rewards relating to the heritage of forebears were more so. While they were keen to pass on their shares to their children, they were uncertain about the level of commitment the next generation members would have. Lessons from this case study are discussed for other <b>multi-generation</b> <b>family</b> businesses focusing on shareholders' responsibilities as owners and the board's need to ensure timely transfer of knowledge to the wider shareholder group.

40|$|A {{prominent}} way {{for firms}} {{to manage their}} moral legitimacy is to invest in sustainability certifications. However, a significant subset of firms remain reluctant to invest in sustainability certifications even decades after the establishment of such certifications. Our paper seeks to elucidate this variance by exploring how firms in the coffee, tea, and chocolate industries legitimise themselves on moral grounds through external communication to stakeholders. Drawing on insights from French Pragmatist Sociology, we suggest that firms primarily rely on two distinct sets of legitimacy principles that reflect their identity orientation: the ‘civic and green’ world and the ‘domestic’ world. Specifically, our results show that reliance on the domestic world is negatively related to firms' investment in sustainability certifications. Our findings also suggest that {{the strength of the}} relationship between these distinct methods of moral legitimising and certification varies depending on whether firms are characterised by first- or <b>multi-generation</b> <b>family</b> control...|$|E

40|$|The factors {{presented}} in this article fit perfectly in a wider discussion on the influence long-term demographic changes have on the size and the structure of the family. The most conspicuous symptoms are: the rise of the number of multi-generation families, triggered by the decrease in the death rate, and {{decrease in the number of}} large (having more than two children) families, caused by a decrease in the fertility rate. The effect of the two processes is an automatic rise of the importance of inter-generation relations in the family, to the loss of intra-generation relations, i. e. a verticalisation of the family net. The article is restricted to the analysis of only one side of the above equation, the changes in the death rate, and its importance for the demographic structure of the Polish family. The result of the changes is a conspicuous rise of the probability of one's being a member of a <b>multi-generation</b> <b>family,</b> this being independent of one's status or position in the genealogical tree (children, children, or grandchildren).

40|$|Popular {{discussions of}} family life in {{contemporary}} society have provided a rather bleak characterization of a social institution believed to be more fragile and disorganized than in past times. Although continuing personal ties with other family members is under-stood as important in tempering the impact both of role strain and overload and also of adverse life events, it has been maintained that urban life is in-consistent with the maintenance of such family ties. Detailed studies of relations within the modified ex-tended family characteristic of urban society, how-ever, have shown high rates of contact across genera-tions, together with acknowledgement of mutual obligations perceived as important by family mem-bers. Consideration {{of the role of}} adult family life as a factor determining personal adjustment reveals a dual paradox. The first results from the use of psychological formulations concerning the develop-ment of the mother-infant bond as the basis for por-traying relations within the family of adulthood. These psychological formulations stress the impor-tance of attaining personal autonomy and self-reliance for continuing adjustment in ways which are inconsistent with the extent of mutual caring and interdependence actually reported among adults within the family. A second paradox results from the assumption that older family members may feel par-ticularly isolated from continuing family ties. Not only do reports of life within the <b>multi-generation</b> <b>family</b> contradict this assumption but, ironically, the very continuing obligations and responsibilities which are incurred by older family members across adulthood may be experienced as adversely affecting morale after midlife. Indeed, the most important contribution of these family ties to personal adjust-ment across the second half of life may well be sup-port of personal autonomy rather than the inter...|$|E
40|$|Nonsyndromic {{cleft lip}} {{with or without}} cleft palate (NSCL/P) {{is one of the}} most common {{congenital}} birth defects. NSCL/P is a complex multifactorial disease caused by interactions between multiple environmental and genetic factors. However, the causal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) signature profile underlying the risk of familial NSCL/P still remains unknown. We previously reported a 5. 7 -Mb genomic region on chromosome 18 q 21. 1 locus that potentially contributes to autosomal dominant, low-penetrance inheritance of NSCL/P. In the current study, we performed exome sequencing on 12 familial genomes (6 affected individuals, 2 obligate carriers, and 4 seemingly unaffected individuals) of a six-generation family to identify candidate SNPs associated with NSCL/P risk. Subsequently, targeted bidirectional DNA re-sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -amplified high-risk regions of MYO 5 B gene and sequenom iPLEX genotpying of 29 candidate SNPs were performed on a larger set of 33 members of this NSCL/P family (10 affected + 4 obligate carriers + 19 unaffected relatives) to find SNPs significantly associated with NSCL/P trait. SNP versus NSCL/P association analysis showed the MYO 5 B SNP rs 183559995 GA genotype had an odds ratio of 18. 09 (95 % Confidence Interval= 1. 86 - 176. 34; gender-adjusted Pvalue= 0. 0019) compared to the reference GG genotype. Additionally, the following SNPs were also found significantly associated with NSCL/P risk: rs 1450425 (LOXHD 1), rs 6507992 (SKA 1), rs 78950893 (SMAD 7), rs 8097060, rs 17713847 (SCARNA 17), rs 6507872 (CTIF), rs 8091995 (CTIF) and rs 17715416 (MYO 5 B).

This paper reports results of the first test of a Double Team theory of moral education practices in <b>multi-generation</b> <b>families.</b> A multi-faceted, multi-perspective questionnaire was developed and administered to an initial sample of 45 children, adolescents and adults in 15 intact three-generation Swiss families. Among the most important findings are that parents and grandparents are more alike in their moral education practices than expected. Most respondents see their family moral education practices as democratic, while the children see grandparents as either permissive or traditional and they see the “democratic ” moral education practices of their parents as “permissive. ” Further, there is substantial continuity of values across the three generations. The relative stability of values across generations and the high endorsement of democratic parenting are particularly consistent with the relatively conservative rate of social change that characterizes Swiss participatory democracy.

40|$|We have ascertained a <b>multi-generation</b> <b>family</b> with {{apparent}} {{autosomal recessive}} non-syndromic childhood hearing loss (DFNB). Failure to demonstrate linkage in a genome-wide scan with 300 polymorphic markers has suggested genetic heterogeneity for the hearing loss in this family. This heterogeneity could be demonstrated by analysis of candidate loci and genes for DFNB. Patients in one {{branch of the}} family (branch C) are homozygous for the 35 delG mutation in the GJB 2 gene (DFNB 1). Patients in two other branches (A and B) carry two new mutations in the cadherin 23 (CDH 23) gene (DFNB 12). A homozygous CDH 23 c. 6442 G [...] >A (D 2148 N) mutation is present in branch A. Patients in branch B are compound heterozygous for this mutation and the c. 4021 G [...] >A (D 1341 N) mutation. The substituted aspartic acid residues are highly conserved and {{are part of the}} calcium-binding sites of the extracellular cadherin (EC) domains. Molecular modeling of the mutated EC domains of CDH 23 based on the structure of E-cadherin indicates that calcium-binding is impaired. In addition, other aspartic and glutamic acid residue substitutions in the highly conserved calcium-binding sites reported to cause DFNB 12 are also likely to result in a decreased affinity for calcium. Since calcium provides rigidity to the elongated structure of cadherin molecules enabling homophilic lateral interaction, these mutations are likely to impair interactions of CDH 23 molecules either with CDH 23 or with other proteins. DFNB 12 is the first human disorder that can be attributed to inherited missense mutations in the highly conserved residues of the extracellular calcium-binding domain of a cadherin...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} and prioritise the various success factors linked to the sustainability of large and medium sized family businesses (FB) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A well-researched methodology was used for the synthesis of priorities and the measurement of consistencies. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model was developed with seven criteria and 15 sub-criteria gleaned from prior research. Data were collected using an interview-based survey conducted on twelve medium and large sized family firms in the UAE. The data collected were interpreted and a priority vector was assigned. The findings show that large family businesses in the UAE are aware of transition failure and have long-term planning for their future generations in place; however, they need to give more importance to family values and family capital. On the other hand, medium sized family businesses are less aware of transition failure and have limited long-term planning; they are more concerned with short-term returns. Therefore, they need to create and give more importance to succession planning, strategic planning and corporate governance to ensure their business longevity. The study highlights <b>multi-generation</b> <b>family</b> business sustainability, and identifies the major determinants that the family members and business leaders need to consider for their business continuity and survival. The model can be utilized by academics in family business sustainability studies. The findings interpreted can help policy makers and related associations develop various policies based on the specific factors found to run the family businesses in a sustainable manner. The research model had limited dimensions and the findings cannot be generalized.

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{urbanization}} of Ethiopian cities, the growing demand for housing in its urban areas has accelerated the development of large-scale housing projects. This has created a challenge for local authorities responsible for their development {{in a relatively short}} period of time. Therefore, current housing development follows the conventional approach where limited building types are developed and replicated with minor modifications to accommodate given site conditions. This strategy has resulted in an environment that is not suitable for the traditional lifestyle of common Ethiopian. Studies show that the lack of social and cultural considerations in the current development has hampered the quality of life of its residents. The research conducted in this paper proposes a holistic approach to large-scale housing development in order to provide optimized solutions for social mix and <b>multi-generation</b> <b>family</b> life style in Ethiopia. The holistic approach is developed within a parametric modeling environment supported by Rhinoceros 3 D & Grasshopper and its plug-ins in order to enhance design feasibility studies. The approach is based upon four major components such as 1) social and cultural factors, 2) a neighborhood model of urban typology, 3) a financial model and 4) a massing study model that delineates the possible building variations. A research project location in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia is selected as a test site for the proposed development strategy. The site is part of a large informal settlement that was demolished and replaced by a typical low-cost housing development composed of four and seven story towers. The goal is to generate an alternative building typology based on the new holistic approach, which meets the social, cultural and economic needs of tenants. Analysis of informal settlements in Addis Ababa has identified multigenerational living, socially and financially mixed communities as important ingredients for building a sustainable community. It was also discovered that semiprivate spaces, circulation paths and scalable housing units as key spatial variables that are necessary for the successful cultivation of these communities. Based upon the analysis of social and cultural factors of given urban district, a neighborhood model is developed from existing site context and defined as a space holder for including various architectural programs such as different unit types (studio, one-bed, two-bed), spatial definitions (private, semiprivate, public), and circulation (vertical and horizontal). The financial model is based on the optimization among the three criteria including market value, construction cost, and government incentives in order to provide tangible benefits for encouraging various income groups to participate in this social mix largescale housing community. The financial model guides the direction of generating massing model variations with the parametric application in the boundary of the neighborhood model in terms of 1) number of units, 2) arrangement of spatial definitions, and 3) configuration of circulation. The direct connection between financial model and massing model within neighborhood boundary condition allows a developer to review design alternatives with changing numbers, at the same time, an architect to understand a financial condition of each alternative with modifying designs...|$|E

In post-Soviet Latvia, especially since the 2008 financial crisis and the austerity measures which took away hope for a decent old-age pension, older women migrate abroad in order to salvage their economic wellbeing and support their <b>multi-generation</b> <b>families,</b> which can run to four generations - their children and grandchildren plus, often, their elderly parents. Migration enables these women to maintain multidirectional flows of care and also to achieve economic and psychosocial independence.

MethodThirteen unrelated families {{with at least two}} members with history of seizures were identified; clinical and genealogic data were collected from JME probands and family members. ResultsAll probands had myoclonic and generalized tonic–clonic seizures (GTCS), while absences occurred in 25 % of them. The average age of seizure onset was 13 years. Totally 22 members from 13 families had history of seizures with average age of seizure onset at 18 years. Ten family members had JME, three had epilepsy with GTCS, two had juvenile absence epilepsy, one had adult onset myoclonic epilepsy and six of the affected individuals had unclassified type of epilepsy. In five families, JME was the solely clinical feature. JME dominated among siblings, while phenotypic heterogeneity was observed in second and third degree relatives.

40|$|OBJECTIVES The aims of {{this study}} were to {{identify}} and characterize familial cases of atrial fibrillation (AF) in our clinical practice and to determine whether AF is genetically heterogeneous. BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation is not generally regarded as a heritable disorder, yet a genetic locus for familial AF was previously mapped to chromosome 10. METHODS Of 2, 610 patients seen in our arrhythmia clinic during an 18 -month study period, 914 (35 %) were diagnosed with AF. Familial cases were identified by history and medical records review. Four <b>multi-generation</b> <b>families</b> with autosomal dominant AF (FAF 1 to 4) were tested for linkage to the chromosome 10 AF locus. RESULTS Fifty probands (5 % of all AF patients; 15 % of lone AF patients) were identified with lone AF (age 41 9 years) and a positive family history (1 to 9 additional relatives affected). In FAF 1 to 3, AF was associated with rapid ventricular response. In contrast, AF in FAF- 4 was associated with a slow ventricular response and, with progression of the disease, junctional rhythm and cardiomyopathy. Genotyping of FAF 1 to 4 with deoxyribonucleic acid markers spanning the chromosome 10 q 22 -q 24 region excluded linkage of AF to this locus. In FAF- 4, linkage was also excluded to the chromosome 3 p 22 -p 25 and lamin A/C loci associated wit...|$|R
40|$|Four of the {{research}} projects reported in this thesis start from the gene effects observed in clinical practice. Finding a disease causing gene is challenging, exciting and beneficial for the patient, the family and for the society. Larsen syndrome is a congenital malformation syndrome, most often dominantly inherited, and with usually modest symptoms from the large joints, hands, feet and face. Some of the gene-carriers may however be seriously affected. The positive attitude from {{the members of this}} <b>multi-generation</b> <b>family</b> from Western Sweden has enabled localization of the responsible gene to chromosomal region 3 p 21 -p 14, from which the gene is yet to be cloned (Paper I). Hereditary multiple exostoses is also a dominantly inherited disorder of the bone tissue. All gene carriers exhibit multiple bone tumors on the long bones usually in the proximities of joints. The bony outgrowth from the growth plates may destroy the joint or the adjacent bone structure, but also cause a lot of pain and cause asymmetrical growth in children. Occasionally the exostoses may endanger vital parts of the body. At least 3 human genes may cause exostoses. Affected members from a large pedigree from Western Sweden and their relatives were committed to contribute in the pursuit of the liable gene. The chromosomal locus 11 p 12 -p 11 where EXT 2 gene resides was first found to be the disease causing in this family. Later a novel EXT 2 mutation could be demonstrated in all affected. (Paper II) Best macular dystrophy is a dominantly inherited disorder of the eye. The symptoms from impaired vision start in the tens and progress during adolescence and adulthood, sometimes leading to blindness. Accumulation of lipofuscin pigment in and below retinal pigment cells gradually destroys the macula with following loss of central vision. The disease has many similarities with age-related macula degeneration which {{is the leading cause of}} blindness in the elderly. The work reported in Paper III describes refined localization and identification of the disease causing gene later named Bestrophin. Twelve European families were enrolled in the study, one of them was a four-generation family from Western Sweden. Noonan syndrome is a well-known genetic disorder, said to be inherited dominantly in 50 % of the affected. Short stature in females and infertility in males, as well as symptoms from the head and neck, are the most common signs. Congenital heart malformations and progressive heart failure are the more serious symptoms of this condition. At least 3 genes may produce similar symptoms. The first identified PTPN 11 gene answers for half of the cases. The Paper IV reports a Western Swedish five-generation family with 12 affected members. The PTPN 11 locus was at first excluded in this family. The wide-genome scan with 224 DNA markers identified a likely locus on chromosome 1 p 21 -p 13. Further work is needed to identify the responsible gene. The tripeptidyl peptidase- 2 gene (TPP 2) codes for a large enzyme needed to degrade surplus proteins. The amino acid sequence of this enzyme, isolated from human red blood cells was at first decoded and the cDNA sequence later deduced. The Paper V describes how the gene encoding this enzyme was localized to chromosome band 13 q 32. No disease eventually produced by this gene is yet known but lethality in fetus may be one possible explanation...|$|E
40|$|Specific reading {{disorder}} (SRD), or developmental dyslexia, {{is defined}} as an unexpected difficulty in learning {{to read and write}} when intelligence and senses are normal. Hereditary factors are estimated to play a substantial role in the etiology of SRD, although the exact neurobiological mechanisms involved are rather poorly understood. In this thesis we have investigated the function of three SRD susceptibility candidate genes, DYX 1 C 1, DCDC 2 and ROBO 1, with the aim of finding neurodevelopmental and molecular pathways that might shed light on the etiology of SRD. When research for this thesis began, knockdown of the rodent orthologs of DYX 1 C 1 and DCDC 2 had been shown to disturb radial neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex, but the function of human DYX 1 C 1 and DCDC 2 at the cellular level was still unclear. We discovered that both DYX 1 C 1 and DCDC 2 are involved in signalling pathways that are important in brain development; DYX 1 C 1 is involved in estrogen signalling and DCDC 2 is involved in ciliary signalling. We found that the effect of DYX 1 C 1 on estrogen signalling was concerted through its interaction with estrogen receptors (ERs) in {{in the presence of the}} endogenous ligand, 17 β-estradiol. We observed that DYX 1 C 1 regulates the degradation of ERs, resulting in decreased transcriptional responses to 17 β-estradiol. Our findings suggest that the effects of DYX 1 C 1 on brain development may be at least partially mediated by ERs and that hormonal factors may play a role in SRD. We also observed DYX 1 C 1 and ERα complexes in the neurites of primary rat hippocampal neurons, which suggests a role for DYX 1 C 1 in rapid non-genomic ER signalling. The effect of DCDC 2 on the ciliary signalling was such that the overexpression of DCDC 2 was found to activate SHH signalling, whereas the downregulation of DCDC 2 expression was found to enhance WNT signalling. We also observed that the DCDC 2 protein localizes to the primary cilium in primary rat hippocampal neurons and is involved in regulating the length of the cilium through its role in stabilizing microtubules. DCDC 2 was also found to interact with the ciliary kinesin- 2 subunit KIF 3 A, a key molecule in function and maintenance of cilia. Consistent with a role in ciliary function, the overexpression of DCDC 2 in C. elegans resulted in an abnormal neuronal phenotype that could only be observed in ciliated neurons. Our results were the first to suggest a role for DCDC 2 in the structure and function of primary cilia. Later, others have reported more links between ciliary function and SRD candidate genes, most notably the putative role of DYX 1 C 1 as a cytoplasmic assembly factor for ciliary dynein. ROBO 1 has been discovered as a SRD susceptibility gene in a large <b>multi-generation</b> <b>family,</b> in whom a rare haplotype in the broad genomic area of ROBO 1 is co-segregated with SRD. The expression of ROBO 1 has been shown to be reduced from the SRD-associated haplotype, but the causal factor for the reduced expression was not known. In this thesis we have characterized genetic variation within the SRD-susceptibility haplotype by whole genome sequencing, aiming to identify variants that would increase our understanding of the altered expression of ROBO 1. We found several novel variants in the SRD susceptibility haplotype and tested transcription factor binding to four of the variants by EMSA. We did not detect transcription factor binding to three of the variants. However, one of the variants was bound by the LIM homeobox 2 (LHX 2) transcription factor with increased binding affinity to the non-reference allele. Knockdown of LHX 2 in lymphoblast cell lines extracted from subjects of the DYX 5 -linked family showed decreased expression of ROBO 1 supporting the idea that LHX 2 regulates ROBO 1. Because the regulation of ROBO 1 is likely to be complex and the effect of the novel variants was at the most very subtle in our experiments, it remains unknown if any of them are causal factors for the SRD susceptibility. The mouse ortholog of ROBO 1 has been shown to have many functions in brain development: it is involved in neuronal migration of interneurons and pyramidal cells and in axonal guidance of major nerve tracts. The role of ROBO 1 in mouse brain led us to test two hypotheses on two human populations: 1) We tested whether ROBO 1 controls midline crossing of auditory pathways in the family with reduced expression of ROBO 1 and 2) we tested whether in the normal population ROBO 1 is involved in the development of the corpus callosum, the major axon tract connecting the cerebral hemispheres. The axonal crossing of the auditory pathways was studied using a functional approach, based on magnetoencephalography and frequency tagging. We found impaired interaural interaction in the subjects that had reduced ROBO 1 expression supporting a defect in midline crossing of auditory pathways. Moreover, the deficit in interaural interaction depended on the ROBO 1 in a dose-dependent manner. Our results suggest that ROBO 1 controls midline crossing of the auditory pathways and were the first evidence of a SRD susceptibility gene being linked to a specific sensory function in the human brain. The role of ROBO 1 in callosal development was assessed by studying whether polymorphisms in ROBO 1 correlate with variation in the white matter structure in the corpus callosum. By using data acquired by both structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging we found that five polymorphisms in the regulatory region of ROBO 1 were associated with white matter density in the posterior part of the corpus callosum. One of the polymorphisms, rs 7631357, was also significantly associated with the probability of connections from the body of the corpus callosum to the parietal cortical regions. Our results suggest that the human ROBO 1 may be involved in the regulation of the structure and connectivity of the posterior part of the corpus callosum. Overall, our results support the idea that similarly as in mice, the human ROBO 1 is likely to play many different roles in brain development. In conclusion, the results of this study have advanced the field of SRD research by suggesting new functions for SRD candidate susceptibility genes in cellular and developmental pathways that are highly relevant in the context of brain development. More studies will be needed to clarify the role of genes in the etiology of SRD and in the neurobiology of reading, but our results have provided clues that may be worthwhile to be investigated. Lukivaikeus (eli lukemisen erityisvaikeus tai dysleksia) ilmenee odottamattomana vaikeutena lukemaan oppimisessa henkilöillä, joiden aistit ja älykkyys ovat normaaleja. Perinnöllisillä tekijöillä on arvioitu olevan merkittävä rooli lukivaikeudessa, vaikkakin neurobiologisia mekanismeja lukivaikeuden taustalla tunnetaan vielä melko huonosti. Tässä väitöskirjatyössä tutkimuksen kohteena oli kolme mahdollista lukivaikeuden alttiusgeeniä: DYX 1 C 1, DCDC 2 ja ROBO 1. Tutkimuksen tavoitteena oli selvittää geenien toimintaa sekä solutasolla että aivojen kehityksessä. Havaitsimme, että kaksi alttiusgeeniä DYX 1 C 1 ja DCDC 2 vaikuttavat solunsisäisiin viestintäreitteihin, jotka ovat tärkeitä aivojen kehityksessä. Tuloksemme osoittivat että DYX 1 C 1 säätelee estrogeenireseptorien hajotusta soluissa ja vaikuttaa sitä kautta estrogeenireseptorien viestintään. On mahdollista että hormonaalisten tekijöiden osuutta lukivaikeudessa kannattaisi tutkia tarkemmin. Havaitsimme että DCDC 2 osallistuu erityisen antennimaisen soluelimen cilian (eli värekarvan) kautta tapahtuviin viestintäreitteihin. Lisäksi DCDC 2 säätelee cilian pituutta. Tuloksemme olivat ensimmäinen tutkimus joissa lukihäiriön alttiusgeeni yhdistettiin cilian toimintaan. Myöhemmin muut tutkimukset ovat löytäneet lisää yhteyksiä cilian ja lukivaikeuden alttiusgeenien välille. ROBO 1 geenin harvinainen muoto periytyy yhdessä lukivaikeuden kanssa suuressa suomalaisessa perheessä. ROBO 1 :n ilmentyminen on vähentynyt harvinaisen geenimuodon kantajilla, mutta tarkkaa syytä tähän ei tiedetä. Tässä väitöskirjatutkimuksessa käytimme uuden sukupolven sekvensointitekniikoita etsiäksemme ROBO 1 geenin harvinaisen muodon kantajilta uusia geneettisiä variantteja ROBO 1 geenin alueelta ja sen ympäristöstä. Löysimme useita variantteja, jotka saattavat vaikuttaa ROBO 1 :n ilmentymiseen. Lisäksi tutkimme magnetoenkefalografian avulla aivoissa tapahtuvaa vasemmasta ja oikeasta korvasta tulevien viestien vuorovaikutusta (binauraalinen vuorovaikutus) ja huomasimme että harvinaisen ROBO 1 geenimuodon kantajilla oli vähemmän binauraalista vuorovaikutusta kuin kontrollihenkilöillä. Binauraalinen vuorovaikutus oli sitä heikompaa mitä vähemmän ROBO 1 geeni ilmentyi. Tuloksemme osoittavat että todennäköisesti ROBO 1 säätelee kuuloratojen risteämistä aivoissa, sillä binauraalinen vuorovaikutus on riippuvaista kuuloratojen osittaisesta risteämisestä. Tutkimme myös ROBO 1 geenin toimintaa aivokurkiaisen kehityksessä diffuusiotensorikuvantamisen ja rakenteellisen magneettiresonanssikuvantamisen avulla. Tässä tutkimuksessa koehenkilöt olivat otos normaaliväestöstä. Havaitsimme, että viisi ROBO 1 geenin alueella olevaa yhden emäksen muutosta korreloivat aivokurkiaisen takaosan vakoisen aineen tiheyden kanssa. Tuloksemme viittaavat siihen että ROBO 1 voi osallistua aivokurkiaisen rakenteen säätelyyn. Kaiken kaikkiaan tuloksemme tukevat ajatusta että ROBO 1 geeni osallistuu monien aivojen kehityksen kannalta oleellisiin toimintoihin. Tämän väitöskirjatutkimuksen tulokset ovat edistäneet lukivaikeuden ymmärtämistä ehdottamalla uusia mahdollisia toimintoja lukivaikeuden alttiusgeeneille...|$|E

40|$|With more {{competition}} {{to earn more}} money to support the family in contemporary China, parents spend less time on their children, particularly in metropolitan cities. Under this circumstances, young parents turn to their parents for help so that {{an increasing number of}} grandparents shoulder the tasks of taking care of their grandchildren. However, the responsibilities of grandparent caregivers are more difficult than they expected because previous parenting experiences are less applicable for the new set of challenges in modern life. This leads to ambivalences between parents and grandparents in many aspects, including use of language, leisure activities and behaviors. This thesis concentrates on grandparenting practice in contemporary urban Wuhan, China, focusing on identifying the reasons for grandparenting, and the differences in children caring between the two generations. From the findings, it is easier to understand how families get along with each other in the <b>multi-generations</b> <b>families,</b> and why they have differences concerning children rearing. The research was conducted by case studies of two families. Ethnographic methods were applied to collect information from grandparents, parents, and children who was in primary school. Data gathering included observations and individual interviews. This study contributes {{to a better understanding of}} grandparents and parents’ attitudes by one another. This is important because as more young adults who want to have their second child – allowed by the universal two-child policy – the more relevant the phenomenon of grandparenting will be. published_or_final_versionEducationMasterMaster of Educatio...|$|R
40|$|Background. Regular {{consumption}} of a well balanced breakfast is a pre-requisite for normal growth and child develop-ment, {{along with the}} acquisition of proper eating habits. The family environment is crucial place where children learn such patterns of behaviour that {{form the basis for}} their development. Objectives. To determine how family factors affect the regular eating of breakfast and types of foodstuffs consumed in primary school pupils, including food purchases made from vending machines and school tuck shops. Materials and methods. Subjects were 836 pupils (435 girls and 401 boys, aged 6 - 13) from Warsaw and the surrounding areas. Appropriate socio-demographic data and relevant eating habits were obtained from direct interviewing of the subjects by means of a custom designed questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed by the Kohonen type cluster analysis model and Chi-square test (Chi 2); (p≤ 0. 05). Results. Three clusters of pupils were identified by their differing socio-demographics and eating habits (eg. rates of breakfast consumption, buying from vending machines or school tuck shops). The first and third clusters were mainly pupils from two-parent families with parents proportionally spending similar times at work, where respective breakfast (87 % and 91 %) and second breakfast (77 % and 72 %) consumption rates were also similar together with food shopping rates during school time (respectively 69 % and 63 %).

40|$|On {{the ground}} of initial results of the National Census {{recently}} carried out an attempt has been undertaken to present the situation and structure of households and families in Poland. On {{the day of the}} Census Poland numbered 35, 061, 000 people, 10, 048, 000 households, and 9, 435, 000 families. One-family households prevailed (77, 8 %), especially in the country, where they amounted to 81, 4 % {{of the total number of}} households. The share of two-family households is insignificant not only in towns, where they amounted to 3, 8 %, but also in the country (6. 2 %). The share of three-family households, or even larger, is insignificant (0, 1 %). It delivers a picture of decay of <b>multi-generation</b> <b>families</b> in Poland, which existed in the past. A predominating place is occupied by a model of family consisting of both parents and children (63, 6 %). Families consisting of a mother all alone and her children amount to 11, 8 %, and of a father and children only to 1, 5 % of the total number of families. In the subsequent part of the article the problem of the number of children in families has been considered, as well as the problem of so called economic number of children. It results from it, that country families pay substantially higher economic efforts in favour of the process of generation replaceability than urban families.
