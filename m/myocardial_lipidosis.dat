40|$|Inflammatory arthropathies and {{systemic}} rheumatic diseases (IASRDs) commonly involve the cardiovascular system, and {{are associated with}} high morbidity and mortality. Mechanisms of cardiovascular involvement in these clinical entities are not fully understood. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the single imaging modality capable of assessing non-invasively cardiac function, strain, ischaemia, altered vascular function, perfusion, oedema/inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can give further insights into the status of <b>myocardial</b> energetics and <b>lipidosis.</b> The pathophysiological mechanisms and phenotype of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in IASRDs need further clarification. CMR is an ideal tool for the early identification and monitoring of cardiac manifestations in patients with IASRDs. Hence, the aims of this D. Phil project were to (i) utilise CMR and MRS to study disease mechanisms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) {{and systemic}} sclerosis (SSc), and (ii) to assess the role of anti-cytokine therapies in abrogation of cardiovascular complications and effects on cardiovascular function in patients with RA, ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). First, we used CMR to assess myocardial structure and function in RA, SLE and SSc patients with no known cardiovascular symptoms. Patients and controls were stratified {{by the presence of}} traditional cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs). Our data demonstrated no differences in overall left ventricular (LV) systolic function, size and mass between patients and matched controls. There were, however, impairments in regional function and myocardial deformation, which is most severe in RA, SLE and SSc patients with CVRFs. We also found evidence of impaired vascular function in RA, SLE and SSc, using pulse wave velocity (PWV) and aortic distensibility, and again, showed that patients with CVRFs demonstrated the most severe aberrations, while patients without CVRFs and controls with CVRFs had an intermediate phenotype. Abnormalities in vascular and regional function were most severe in patients with SSc. Also, we showed that impaired vascular function correlated with abnormal systolic myocardial strain and diastolic strain rate in all groups of IASRDs studied. These data have implications for the clinical care of patients with RA, SLE and SSc and show that there is extensive cardiovascular involvement in asymptomatic patients. These results also suggest that early identification and stratification of CVD in IASRDs, with non-invasive techniques like CMR, may permit earlier intervention, thus potentially reducing the effect of CVD on morbidity and mortality in IASRDs. Lastly, these data highlight the importance of early detection and aggressive management of co-existent traditional CVRFs, as they confer incremental risk of CVD in patients with IASRDs. Second, we used CMR for comprehensive phenotyping of tissue characteristics in patients with RA, SLE and SSc. Our data confirmed that subclinical myocardial changes are common in patients with IASRDs (even with apparently normal hearts), which can be detected using multiparametric CMR. In addition to focal areas of fibrosis (detected by late gadolinium enhancement [LGE]), there were also areas of focal myocardial oedema or inflammation (detected by T 2 -weighted imaging). Further, using more sensitive techniques such as native T 1 mapping and extracellular volume (ECV) quantification, we were able to demonstrate even more areas of myocardial involvement in IASRD patients than conventional CMR techniques can reveal, with patients showing significantly larger areas of T 1 abnormality and expanded ECV, which likely represent a combination of low grade inflammation and diffuse myocardial fibrosis that are well-described disease processes in this cohort. We also found that T 1 and ECV measures were associated with subtle myocardial systolic and diastolic dysfunction. The {{results of this study suggest}} that CMR, particularly T 1 and ECV quantification, can be used for early detection of subclinical myocardial involvement in IASRD patients, potentially serving as an early screening tool before overt LV dysfunction or irreversible myocardial damage occurs. Third, we utilised CMR to study myocardial perfusion in patients with RA, SLE and SSc. We found that myocardial perfusion was impaired in asymptomatic IASRD with no overt heart disease. Non-segmental, subendocardial perfusion defects consistent with microvascular dysfunction were present in 47 %, 31 % and 41 % of RA, SLE and SSc patients, respectively. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between MPRI and systolic and diastolic regional function in all groups of patients. In RA and SSc, there was also a correlation between myocardial perfusion reserve index (MPRI) and disease activity. SSc patients had the greatest burden of ECV expansion, and in this group ECV also correlated with MPRI. These data led us to hypothesise that myocardial ischaemia likely leads to impaired myocardial relaxation and diffuse fibrosis, which predate overt dysfunction in contractility. Fourth, we investigated the effect of TNF-alpha inhibitors on myocardial and vascular function and structure in RA, AS and PsA patients. We confirmed that anti-TNF therapy was associated with improvements in serum inflammatory parameters like CRP and ESR, as well as with improved clinical measures of disease activity. Anti-TNF therapy, however, was not related to a change in left ventricular size, mass and global systolic function. We found that inhibition of TNF-alpha activity does result in better myocardial strain and strain rate, likely reflecting an improvement in myocardial inflammatory burden. Moreover, these findings were also supported by improvements in T 2 weighted measures, native T 1 values and ECV calculations. There was, however, no significant change in myocardial perfusion following anti-TNF therapy. These results support the hypothesis that during episodes of disease activity, myocardial oedema is present in patients with IASRDS and that by reducing the systemic inflammatory response, improvements in myocardial and vascular function can be achieved. Finally, we used CMR and MRS in asymptomatic RA and SLE patients (with normal hearts on echocardiography) to investigate cardiac metabolic status in this cohort. We found that myocardial energetics were impaired in patients, despite preserved overall ejection fraction. Interestingly, abnormal myocardial energetics were associated with presence of LGE, decreased myocardial perfusion, expanded ECV, volume fraction of T 1 > 990 ms (which represents > 2 standard deviations above the mean T 1 value at 1. 5 T) and left atrial size. We did not find any difference in myocardial and hepatic lipid content between patients and controls. These data clearly demonstrate that abnormalities in cardiac energetics are present in IASRD patients even before the development of overt cardiac dysfunction, and may be driven by microvascular function and fibrosis.

40|$|Erucic acid is the {{trivial name}} of the fatty acid cis- 13 -docosenoic acid and occurs at high {{concentrations}} mainly in the seeds of species of the Brassicaceae (e. g. rape seed or mustard seed). The European Commission requested EFSA to deliver a scientific opinion on the risks for animal and human health related {{to the presence of}} erucic acid in feed and food. For most humans, the main contributor to dietary exposure to erucic acid was the food group ‘Fine bakery wares’. In ‘Infants’, ‘Food for infants and small children’ was the main contributor to exposure. The heart is the principal target organ for toxic effects after exposure. <b>Myocardial</b> <b>lipidosis</b> was identified as the critical effect for chronic exposure to erucic acid. This effect is reversible and transient during prolonged exposure. A tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 7 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day for erucic acid was established, based on a no observed adverse effect level of 0. 7 g/kg bw per day for lipidosis in young rats and newborn piglets. Mean chronic exposure of the different groups of the population did not exceed the TDI. The 95 th percentile dietary exposure level was highest in infants and other children, ranging from 1. 3 to 7. 4 mg/kg bw per day; the higher level being {{at the level of the}} TDI. This may indicate a risk for young individuals with high erucic acid exposure. In pigs, levels of erucic acid are unlikely to represent a health concern. However, for poultry, the small margin between the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) and the estimated exposure may indicate a health risk where maximum inclusion rates are applied. Due to the absence of adequate data, the risk for ruminants, horses, fish and rabbits could not be assessed. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutical Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. X-adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder {{characterized by the}} accumulation of saturated unbranched very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA), particularly hexacosanoic acid (C 26 : 0) and tetracosanoic acid (C 24 : 0) in plasma and brain. Peroxisomal β-oxidation is also impaired. It affects the cerebral white matter, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, adrenal cortex and testis (Kemp et al., 2004). It {{is caused by a}} defect in the ABCD 1 gene, which maps to Xq 28 and codes the peroxisomal membrane protein, adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP). To date, there is no effective therapy, except for Lorenzo's oil, which consists of oleic acid (C 18 : 1) and erucic acid (C 22 : 1). Treatment with Lorenzo's oil elicits a good biochemical response and cause a decreased in plasma VLCFA levels in patients. However, improvement of neurological symptoms has not been reported. Treatment of X-ALD with monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid and erucic acid lead to the normalization of C 26 : 0 levels, possibly as a result of competition for the microsomal elongation system (Rizzo et aI., 1986). Erucic acid is a mono-unsaturated omega- 9 fatty acid, denoted C 22 : 1 ω- 9. It is a potent inhibitor of saturated very long chain fatty acids (SVLCFA). Because erucic acid competes for the microsomal elongation system, the inhibition of SVLCFA synthesis can lead to inhibition of polyunsaturated fatty acids that are elongated by the same system. Dosages between 400 mg/kg and 1500 mg/kg erucic acid have been tested by Kramer and co-workers (1992). Spraque-Dawley rats (10 rats per group) have been treated for one week with oils that contained 2. 5 to 9 % erucic acid concentration. The dosages of 1500 mg/kg and higher produced significantly increased <b>myocardial</b> <b>lipidosis.</b> The aim in this pilot {{study was to determine the}} optimum dosage for erucic acid in Sprague-Dawley rats that will lower levels of SVLCFA. A further aim was to assess its effect on the biosynthesis and incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) into the plasma and brain phospholipids. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were individually housed in metabolic cages with free access to laboratory food and water. The rats were divided into 5 groups (n = 10 in each) including a control group (n = 10). Dosages of 400 mg/kg, 575 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg, 625 mg/kg and 800 mg/kg of erucic acid, dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), were given by gavage to the five groups respectively for 7 days. The control group received the vehicle, DMSO. The rats were decapitated on day 8 and brain and blood samples were collected and frozen at - 20 °C until assayed. The inhibitory effect of different dosages of erucic acid on total plasma SVLCFA concentrations and concentration ratios was determined using a standardized method employing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). These results were expressed in μmol/L. For the determination of SVLCFA and PUFA in the plasma and brain phospholipids, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thin layer chromatography (TLC) were used. Fatty acids were expressed as a percentage of the total lipid composition and subsequent ratios were calculated. Statistical comparisons of data between the groups were done using analysis of variance (ANOVA). A dose of 600 mg/kg erucic acid reduced C 24 : 0 and C 26 : 0 levels and decreased the C 24 : 0 /C 22 : 0 ratio the most. These reduction were, however, not Significantly different Erucic acid competed with the elongation of EPA (Eicosapentanoic acid) to DPA (Docosapentaenoic acid) in the ω- 3 fatty acid pathway, which was seen as a decreased DPA/EPA ratio in the 600 mg/kg erucic acid group. This effect was seen in both the plasma and brain phospholipids. Erucic acid slightly decreased DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid) (ω- 3) and AA (Arachidonic acid) (ω- 6) concentrations in the plasma phospholipids, but had no influence on DHA levels in the brain phospholipids. A result of concern was the significant increase in arachidonic acid (AA) levels in the brain phospholipids. AA is the precursor to a number of inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes that could lead to inflammation. The latter could explain why neurological symptoms persist, and sometimes even progress in patients with symptomatic ALD who use Lorenzo's oil. Therefore, we conclude that erucic acid treatment in Sprague-Dawley rats reduced VLCFA levels in plasma and that this result is promising. Unfortunately concomitant increased levels of AA in the brain is a matter of concern. Further research into the mechanism of action of erucic acid is called for. Master...|$|E
