40|$|It {{has long}} been {{appreciated}} that gene expression is regulated by protein complexes at promoters. More recently, {{research has demonstrated that}} small duplex RNAs such as micro-RNAs and short <b>interfering</b> <b>RNAs</b> <b>complementary</b> to mRNA provide another layer of regulation. Evidence now supports the existence of regulatory pathways that use small duplex RNAs to control transcription. Synthetic <b>RNAs</b> <b>complementary</b> to gene promoters [antigene RNAs (agRNAs) ] can either activate or inhibit gene expression. Activity of agRNAs is mediated by argonaute, a protein required for RNA interference. Unlike protein transcription factors, agRNAs do not bind to chromosomal DNA but recognize noncoding transcripts that overlap gene promoters or 3 ′-gene termini. This review describes recent studies with agRNAs and focuses on the robust and potent agRNA-mediated regulation of progesterone receptor. The ability of small RNAs to alter transcription provides a new layer of potential regulation for gene expression...|$|R

Putative small <b>interfering</b> (si) <b>RNAs</b> <b>complementary</b> in sequence to Cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV, genus Luteovirus) genomes were identified. Primer sequences were made against the “high scoring” siRNA sequences and RT-PCR was used to amplify a 438 bp CYDV fragment in total RNA extracts from D. glomerata leaves.

In D. glomerata the CYDV infection rates were 42. 3...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe use of long {{double-stranded}} RNA (dsRNA) for {{gene silencing}} in mammalian cells {{has generally been}} restricted to embryonic cell types and proposed to induce non-specific effects on gene expression in differentiated cells. In this study, we report that foreign and endogenous gene expression can be regulated in immortalised human cell lines by co-expression of long <b>complementary</b> <b>RNAs</b> {{with the potential to}} form dsRNA. The observed gene silencing effect was transferable to recipient control cells, occurred independently of cytoplasmic Dicer and produced an epi-allelic series of clones suitable for gene function studies.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of viral <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> by vesicular stomatitis virus in permissive cells {{can be distinguished}} operationally into two phases, primary transcription, which {{can be observed in}} cycloheximide treated cells, and secondary transcription, which represents the further {{synthesis of}} viral <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> obtained in untreated cells. Pretreatment of mouse L cells or chicken embryo fibroblasts with the homologous interferon and, for chicken embryo fibroblast cells, poly(rI) :poly(rC), inhibits the production of infectious virus and reduces the synthesis of viral <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> to levels comparable to that obtained during primary transcription. Treatment of mouse L cells with interferon plus cycloheximide also gives levels of vesicular stomatitis viral <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> synthesis comparable to that observed with the cycloheximide treatment alone. Similar results have been obtained for interferontreated cells subsequently infected with influenza virus (strain WSN). The results are interpreted as indicating that inhibition of virus development by interferon does not act at the level of primary transcription but rather at an intermediate step between primary and secondary transcription, such as viral protein synthesis...|$|R
40|$|In vitro {{transcription}} of poliovirus RNA was catalyzed by {{the combination}} of a virus-coded polymerase and a host cell protein (host factor). Antibody to host factor inhibited template-dependent synthesis of <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> where presumably RNA chain initiation occurred. On the contrary, elongation of already initiated RNA chains catalyzed by the replicase-template complex was not inhibited by anti-host factor antibody. These results strongly favored our previous notion that the host factor was needed for the initiation step of viral <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Creation of an {{artificial}} mRNA-interfering <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> (micRNA) immune system, utilizing anti-sense RNAs to inhibit viral gene expression, {{has been shown}} to be an effective way to prevent viral infection. In the RNA coliphage SP, the gene for the maturation protein was found to be the best target for this type of immune system; mRNA-interfering <b>complementary</b> <b>RNAs</b> specific to the genes for coat protein and replicase were less effective in preventing infection. The greatest inhibitory effect was observed with a 240 -base sequence encompassing the 24 -base noncoding region of the maturation gene plus the 216 -base coding sequence. Significantly, even a 19 -base sequence covering only the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (ribosome-binding region) without the coding region exerted a strong inhibitory effect on phage proliferation. In contrast to the highly specific action against phage SP exhibited by the longer mRNA-interfering <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA,</b> the specificity with the shorter mRNA-interfering <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> was broadened to phages Q beta and GA as well as SP, all of which are classified in the different groups of RNA coliphages. Therefore, this type of anti-viral reagent may be designed to have a particular breadth of specificity, thus increasing its value in various research and possibly clinical applications...|$|R

The complementary DNA was then transcribed into 32 P-labeled <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> by E. coli RNA polymerase {{in the presence of}} α- 32 P-labeled ribonucleoside triphosphates. The fingerprint pattern obtained from ribonuclease T 1 digests of human globin <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> was specific and reproducible. Different patterns were obtained from digests of duck, mouse, and rabbit globin <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA.</b> The fingerprint patterns obtained from digests of purified natural human 10 S globin messenger RNA, labeled in vitro with 125 I or with [γ- 32 P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase, were {{similar to that of the}} <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> but contained some additional oligonucleotides. Sufficient nucleotide sequence information has been obtained from about 50 % of the intermediate sized oligonucleotides (8 - 14 base residues long), to make possible examination of correspondence between these nucleotide sequences and globin amino-acid sequences. Approximately 70 % of these oligonucleotide sequences can be matched to unique amino-acid sequences in the α- or ß -globin chains. The other 30 % do not match known amino-acid sequences and presumably correspond to untranslated portions of the mRNA; some of these sequences, however, can be matched to amino-acid sequences in the abnormally long segment of the chain of hemoglobin Constant Spring, which is thought to result from a chain-termination mutation...|$|R
40|$|The {{program of}} {{transcription}} in phage gh- 1 -infected Pseudomonas putida was examined.

Smears of hemoflagellates were fixed with a formaldehyde-containing fixative, the DNA was heat-denatured in situ {{in the presence of}} 50 % formamide and hybridization with <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> was carried out with 20 μl RNA at 0. 6 μg/ml. Unspecifically bound RNA was removed by treatment with ribonucleases and hybridization was quantitatively evaluated on autoradiograms with a microphotometer. In intraspecific hybridization reactions with Crithidia luciliae and Trypanosoma mega, RNA was bound only to the kinetoplast and not to the nucleus. In the interspecific hybridization reaction no cross-hybridization was found at all, either on cytological preparations or with kinetoplast DNA fixed to nitrocellulose filters. This shows that the evolution of a major part of kinetoplast DNA is not highly restricted. Cytological hybridization may, therefore, provide a useful method to differentiate closely related species of pathogenic hemoflagellates. © 1973. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

The biological function of the novel 30 C 02 effector protein of the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines, was studied using Arabidopsis thaliana as host and the beet cyst nematode, Heterodera schachtii, which contains a homologue of the 30 C 02 gene. Expression of Hg 30 C 02 in Arabidopsis did not affect plant growth and development but increased plant susceptibility to infection by H. schachtii. The 30 C 02 protein interacted with a specific (AT 4 G 16260) host plant β- 1, 3 -endoglucanase in both yeast and plant cells, possibly to interfere with {{its role as a}} plant pathogenesis-related protein. Interestingly, the peak expression of 30 C 02 in the nematode and peak expression of At 4 g 16260 in plant roots coincided at around 3 – 5 d after root infection by the nematode, after which the relative expression of At 4 g 16260 declined significantly. An Arabidopsis At 4 g 16260 T-DNA mutant showed increased susceptibility to cyst nematode infection, and plants that overexpressed At 4 g 16260 were reduced in nematode susceptibility, suggesting a potential role of host β- 1, 3 -endoglucanase in the defence response against H. schachtii infection.
