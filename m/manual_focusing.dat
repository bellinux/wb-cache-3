2500|$|The larger, {{advanced}} {{digital cameras}} offer a non-optical electronic through-the-lens (TTL) view, via an eye-level electronic viewfinder (EVF) {{in addition to}} the rear LCD. The difference in view compared with a DSLR is that the EVF shows a digitally created image, whereas the viewfinder in a DSLR shows an actual optical image via the reflex viewing system. An EVF image has lag time (that is, it reacts with a delay to view changes) and has a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder but achieves parallax-free viewing using less bulk and mechanical complexity than a DSLR with its reflex viewing system. Optical viewfinders tend to be more comfortable and efficient, especially for action photography and in low-light conditions. Compared with digital cameras with LCD electronic viewfinders, there is no time lag in the image: it is always correct as it is being [...] "updated" [...] at the speed of light. This is important for action or sports photography, or any other situation where the subject or the camera is moving quickly. Furthermore, the [...] "resolution" [...] of the viewed image is much better than that provided by an LCD or an electronic viewfinder, which can be important if <b>manual</b> <b>focusing</b> is desired for precise focusing, as would be the case in macro photography and [...] "micro-photography" [...] (with a microscope). An optical viewfinder may also cause less eye-strain. However, electronic viewfinders may provide a brighter display in low light situations, as the picture can be electronically amplified.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Manual</b> <b>focusing</b> is {{assisted}} by focus peaking, which enables easy focusing with any manual lens.|$|E
50|$|In photography, <b>manual</b> <b>focus</b> override, {{also known}} as {{full-time}} <b>manual</b> <b>focus,</b> allows <b>manual</b> intervention in the autofocus acquisition process simply by turning the focus ring on a photographic lens.|$|R
5000|$|The {{viewfinder}} can zoom into one's preview, which a mirror-based viewfinder cannot do. This is why using <b>manual</b> <b>focus</b> {{through a}} zoomed EVF is more precise than <b>manual</b> <b>focus</b> through a mirror.|$|R
50|$|<b>Manual</b> <b>focus</b> and Macro: The Digilux 1 and DMC-LC5 {{can be set}} for macro <b>focus,</b> {{and also}} <b>manual</b> <b>focus</b> (fly by wire.) Camera cards: It will handle up to a 1GB SD card only.|$|R
50|$|The EVF has a {{high enough}} {{resolution}} view that <b>manual</b> <b>focusing</b> is possible. Unlike traditional optical viewfinders which may use a ground glass focusing screen, the GH1 EVF takes {{a small portion of}} the scene and magnifies it 10X. This magnified portion may be moved around to any section of the live view. In manual focus mode, touching the lens focus ring will immediately turn on the magnification for <b>manual</b> <b>focusing.</b>|$|E

50|$|Being an {{autofocus}} camera, {{it has two}} autofocus modes, and {{an option}} for <b>manual</b> <b>focusing.</b> Its viewfinder is a glass pentaprism. It also has a two-inch, thin-film transistor, color liquid-crystal monitor with approximately 120,000 pixels.|$|E
5000|$|The Mark II has an {{increased}} number of autofocus modes, and retains an option for <b>manual</b> <b>focusing.</b> Its viewfinder is a [...] "fixed pentaprism". The two-inch, TFT, color LCD has been upgraded to approximately 230,000 pixels.|$|E

50|$|Internal lens {{controllers}} take {{information from}} the camera or lens elements and perform automatic and <b>manual</b> <b>focusing</b> and aperture adjustment. They are frequently contained inside {{as part of a}} modern zoom lens and used mainly for photography.|$|E
50|$|The {{viewfinder}} {{also had}} a fixed focusing screen with Asahi Optical's standard split image rangefinder and microprism collar <b>manual</b> <b>focusing</b> aids. The split image rangefinder was a good indication of {{the width of the}} AF sensor field of view.|$|E
50|$|Canon {{also sold}} a manual-focus camera, the Canon EF-M, which {{used the same}} EF lens mount as the EOS cameras. It came with all the {{automatic}} and manual exposure functions but lacked autofocus. It came equipped with a split-screen/microprism focusing screen for precise <b>manual</b> <b>focusing.</b>|$|E

5000|$|This lens {{represents}} several [...] "firsts" [...] for Pentax. It is {{the first}} Pentax lens to feature Super ED glass for improved chromatic aberration suppression and Aero Bright II nano-coating to minimize flare. The D FA* 70-200mm lens {{is also one of}} the first two Pentax lenses to feature an improved implementation of the Quick-Shift <b>Focus</b> System (full-time <b>manual</b> <b>focus),</b> with QFS/A and QFS/M positions on the autofocus switch. In QFS/A mode, the lens will not allow <b>manual</b> <b>focus</b> during autofocus operation until focusing is complete. In QFS/M mode, autofocus will stop and switch to <b>manual</b> <b>focus</b> immediately as soon as the focus ring is turned.|$|R
50|$|The K1000 {{is often}} sold with {{a version of}} the SMC Pentax 50mm f/2 lens. The K1000 accepts all <b>manual</b> <b>focus</b> lenses with the Pentax K bayonet mount, {{introduced}} in 1975 with the Pentax K-series SLRs. This includes the K-A mount lenses introduced in 1983. <b>Manual</b> <b>focus</b> lenses made by Asahi Optical are the SMC Pentax, SMC Pentax-M and SMC Pentax-A types.|$|R

5000|$|The EF 50mm 1.8 II {{replaced}} the EF 50mm 1.8 in 1991. The EF 50mm 1.8 II {{has lost the}} metal lens mount, the distance scale, the IR focusing label and the separate <b>manual</b> <b>focusing</b> ring {{that came with the}} original EF 50mm 1.8.|$|E
50|$|The lens {{features}} 2nd-generation {{image stabilization}} (IS) technology, ring-type USM with full-time <b>manual</b> <b>focusing</b> and a non-rotating front element, however the barrel does extend with zooming. The lens uses a six-blade aperture, and contains a single aspherical (molded, not ground) lens. Closest focusing distance is approximately 50 cm (19.2 inches).|$|E
50|$|Uniquely amongst Canon EOS bodies it had {{an optical}} <b>manual</b> <b>focus</b> aid, a {{split-image}} focusing screen {{as well as a}} ring of microprisms. This system was common with <b>manual</b> <b>focus</b> SLRs but had since fallen out of use in the autofocus era. The screen can be installed in several autofocus EOS cameras, and can only be obtained by purchasing a used EF-M.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, Nippon Kogaku {{manufactured}} approximately 70 {{different types of}} <b>manual</b> <b>focus</b> Nikkor AI-S and Nikon Series E branded lenses.

The AF-S Nikkor, AF-I Nikkor, AF Nikkor D and AF Nikkor autofocus lenses will work for <b>manual</b> <b>focus</b> only.|$|R

50|$|The SMC Pentax-FA 31mm f/1.8 AL Limited is a full-frame {{moderate}} {{wide-angle lens}} for Pentax K-mount. On an APS-C camera, {{it gives a}} normal field of view.

50|$|<b>Manual</b> <b>focusing</b> {{is usually}} a {{requisite}} for professional filmmaking, because autofocus systems may focus on undesired objects, or fail to adjust quickly enough to sudden changes.
