25|$|The term {{deforestation}} has {{a meaning}} that covers crossing {{the threshold of}} forest's resilience and losing its ability to return its originally stable state. To recover itself, a forest ecosystem needs suitable interactions among climate conditions and bio-actions, and enough area. In addition, generally, the resilience of a forest system allows recovery from a relatively small scale of damage (such as lightning or landslide) of up to 10 per cent of its area. The larger the scale of damage, the <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> is for the forest ecosystem to restore and maintain its balance.|$|E
25|$|To {{interrupt}} a read burst by a {{write command}} is possible, but <b>more</b> <b>difficult.</b> <b>It</b> can be done, if the DQM signal {{is used to}} suppress output from the SDRAM so that the memory controller may drive data over the DQ lines to the SDRAM {{in time for the}} write operation. Because the effects of DQM on read data are delayed by 2 cycles, but the effects of DQM on write data are immediate, DQM must be raised (to mask the read data) beginning at least two cycles before write command, but must be lowered for the cycle of the write command (assuming the write command is intended to have an effect).|$|E

25|$|Diagnosis is {{relatively}} easy when all the symptoms of narcolepsy are present, but if the sleep attacks are isolated and cataplexy is mild or absent, diagnosis is <b>more</b> <b>difficult.</b> <b>It</b> is also possible for cataplexy to occur in isolation. Three tests that are commonly used in diagnosing narcolepsy are the polysomnogram, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and administration of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. These tests are usually performed by a sleep specialist. The polysomnogram involves continuous recording of sleep brain waves {{and a number of}} nerve and muscle functions during night time sleep. When tested, people with narcolepsy fall asleep rapidly, enter REM sleep early, and may often awaken during the night. The polysomnogram also helps to detect other possible sleep disorders that could cause daytime sleepiness.|$|E
25|$|Serious local errors {{can arise}} in {{homology}} models where an insertion or deletion mutation or {{a gap in}} a solved structure result in a region of target sequence {{for which there is}} no corresponding template. This problem can be minimized by the use of multiple templates, but the method is complicated by the templates' differing local structures around the gap and by the likelihood that a missing region in one experimental structure is also missing in other structures of the same protein family. Missing regions are most common in loops where high local flexibility increases the difficulty of resolving the region by structure-determination methods. Although some guidance is provided even with a single template by the positioning of the ends of the missing region, the longer the gap, the <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> is to model. Loops of up to about 9 residues can be modeled with moderate accuracy in some cases if the local alignment is correct. Larger regions are often modeled individually using ab initio structure prediction techniques, although this approach has met with only isolated success.|$|E
