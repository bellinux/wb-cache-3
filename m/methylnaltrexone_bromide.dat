25|$|If {{laxatives}} are insufficiently effective (which {{is often}} the case), opioid formulations or regimens that include a peripherally-selective opioid antagonist, such as <b>methylnaltrexone</b> <b>bromide,</b> naloxegol, alvimopan, or naloxone (as in oxycodone/naloxone), may be tried. A 2008 Cochrane review found that the evidence was tentative for alvimopan, naloxone, or <b>methylnaltrexone</b> <b>bromide.</b>|$|E
50|$|Methylnaltrexone (MNTX, {{brand name}} Relistor), used {{in form of}} <b>methylnaltrexone</b> <b>bromide</b> (INN, USAN, BAN), {{is one of the}} newer agents of peripherally-acting μ-opioid antagonists that act to reverse some of the side effects of opioid drugs such as {{constipation}} without affecting analgesia or precipitating withdrawals. Because MNTX is a quaternary ammonium cation, it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, and so has antagonist effects throughout the body, counteracting effects such as itching and constipation, but without affecting opioid effects in the brain such as analgesia. However, since a significant fraction (up to 60%) of opioid analgesia can be mediated by opioid receptors on peripheral sensory neurons, particularly in inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, traumatic or surgical pain, MNTX may increase pain under such circumstances.|$|E
40|$|Constipation is {{a common}} symptom in palliative care {{patients}} which can generate considerable suffering. There is uncertainty about the choice of treatment options from varying recommendations for management of constipation and a varying clinical practice in palliative care settings. The purpose of the review was to evaluate the current recommendations of therapy guidelines {{for the management of}} opioid-induced constipation in palliative care patients with a focus on <b>methylnaltrexone</b> <b>bromide.</b> Recent findings in the literature and related information on the opioid-induced gastrointestinal disorders in patients with advanced illness, as well as information on the opioid-antagonist methylnaltrexone, are discussed. Knowledge of the role of definitions, the causes of constipation and the pathophysiology of opioid-induced constipation must be given high priority in the treatment of patients receiving opioids. Diagnosis and therapy of constipation, therefore, should relate to findings in clinical investigation. Opioid-induced constipation and its adequate treatment is an important issue for patients with advanced illness and also poses therapeutic challenge for clinicians in daily routine. <b>Methylnaltrexone</b> <b>bromide</b> may represent an important therapeutic option for palliative care patients who are suffering from opioid-induced constipation with failure of conventional prophylactic oral laxative treatment...|$|E

Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction can lead to refractory constipation. <b>Methylnaltrexone</b> <b>bromide</b> is a peripherally acting mu antagonist and is indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness, when response to standard laxative therapy has been inefficacious.

40|$|Abstract: Constipation is a {{significant}} problem related to opioid medications used to manage pain. This review attempts to outline the latest findings related to the therapeutic usefulness of a μ opioid receptor antagonist, methylnaltrexone {{in the treatment of}} opioid-induced constipation. The review highlights <b>methylnaltrexone</b> <b>bromide</b> (Relistor TM; Progenics/Wyeth) a quaternary derivative of naltrexone, which was recently approved in the United States, Europe and Canada. The Food and Drug Administration in the United States approved a subcutaneous injection for the treatment of opioid bowel dysfunction in patients with advanced illness who are receiving palliative care and when laxative therapy has been insufficient. Methylnaltrexone is a peripherally restricted, μ opioid receptor antagonist that accelerates oral–cecal transit in patients with opioidinduced constipation without reversing the analgesic effects of morphine or inducing symptoms of opioid withdrawal. An analysis of the mechanism of action and the potential benefits of using methylnaltrexone is based on data from published basic research and recent clinical studies...|$|E
40|$|Although opioids offer potent {{analgesia}} {{for severe}} acute and chronic noncancer pain, adverse gastrointestinal effects potentially undermine their clinical utility. In particular, between 40 % and 95 % of patients develop opioid-induced constipation (OIC). Therefore, {{there is a}} consensus that patients should commence laxatives {{at the start of}} opioid therapy and continue throughout treatment. Nevertheless, laxatives are not routinely coprescribed with opioids. Even when concurrent laxatives are prescribed, approximately half the patients treated for OIC do not achieve the desired improvement. Moreover, laxatives do not target the underlying cause of OIC (opioid binding to the μ-receptors in the enteric system) and as such are not very effective at managing OIC. The failure of lifestyle modification and laxatives to treat adequately many cases of OIC led to the concurrent use of peripherally acting opioid antagonists (such as <b>methylnaltrexone</b> <b>bromide</b> and naloxone) to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events without compromising analgesia. Judicious use of the various options to manage OIC should allow more patients to benefit from opioid analgesia. Therefore, this paper reviews the causes, consequences, and management of OIC to help clinicians optimise opioid analgesia...|$|E
