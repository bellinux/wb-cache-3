5|$|The Ohio Department of Development {{estimates}} {{that there are}} 555 <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> production establishments in Ohio, and that by employing around 138,000 people, Ohio <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> production employees account for 12.7% of the United States' <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> production employees. Despite sharp losses since 1999, the <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> production industry was able to recover in 2001, producing {{a net gain of}} 148,000 vehicles. General Motors produced the plurality of motor vehicles in Ohio, with 36.5% of the production of motor vehicles in Ohio, followed closely by Honda with 35.9%. Other major <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> producers in Ohio include DaimlerChrysler (with 17.5% of production) and Ford (with 10.5% of production). However, despite the growth listed above, employment statistics and outlooks are much more grim.|$|E
5|$|The {{current state}} of the <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{industry}} in Ohio is mixed and dotted. In 2002, the Ohio <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> industry produced about $16 billion of items. This is about 14% of the automobile production of the United States, and Ohio outputs every state in production of motor vehicles except for Michigan. These $16 billion account for approximately 4.1% of Ohio's gross state product; however, the <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> industry only accounts for 1.1% of the United States' output. In 2003, Ohio was able to produce about 1,885,000 motor vehicles, accounting for 15.6% of the United States' production, and, again, more than any state except for Michigan, in which 928,000 of these were automobiles.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{the number}} of people {{employed}} in the <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> assembly industry in Ohio was reported to be around 31,000, down from about 40,000 throughout the 1990s, while in the <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> parts production industry in Ohio, in December 1997, employment stood at approximately 122,000 employees; however, that number dropped by about 26% to 90,000 employees by 2004. Despite the growth facts above, the loss of employment is more likely to directly affect Ohio's economy. The Ohio Bureau of Labor Market Information estimates that there will be 3,300 less assembly employees and 2,400 less parts manufacturing employees in 2012 than 2002. Major firms operating in the state include Ford, Honda, and General Motors. Some major <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> assembly production plants in the state include the Toledo Complex, Lordstown Assembly, Marysville Auto Plant, East Liberty Auto Plant, Ohio Assembly, and Toledo North Assembly. France-based Faurecia Group operates a division in Toledo.|$|E
