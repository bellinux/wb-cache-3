50|$|The {{name of the}} {{building}} {{seems to be a}} misnomer as there is very little Egyptian influence in its design. Instead, it is more closely modelled on Greek classical architecture, in particular the Corinthian order of the Tower of the Winds in Athens, which was Thomson's ideal of design. It is speculated that it takes its title from the earlier Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, London, which was the precursor for the large <b>multi-purpose</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>premises</b> of Thomson's building. It is also speculated that some of the shops may have been Egyptian-themed. In addition to the shops, {{the building}} featured a lecture room, bazaar and a large central hall where displays of paintings and antiquities were staged, including the display of the complete Egyptian tomb of Thebes.|$|E
