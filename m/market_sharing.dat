40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsBryan W. SchurleThe {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} simulation model to determine the probability of achieving a <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal. Two different simulation models were developed and compared allowing the author to select the best model. The first simulation model developed used the current <b>market</b> <b>share</b> as the mean and the standard deviation of historical <b>market</b> <b>share</b> as the standard deviation. So, a <b>market</b> <b>share</b> of 31. 00 % and a standard deviation of 3. 88 % were used in the simulation. When these values were simulated the results determined the probability of achieving the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal of 33 %. The simulation results indicated that only 12 out of 100 observations resulted in <b>market</b> <b>share</b> greater than the goal. Therefore, there is a 12 % probability of achieving or exceeding the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal based on the current <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and historical <b>market</b> <b>share</b> standard deviation. To predict future <b>market</b> <b>share,</b> a regression model was used to determine the impact of factors on <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> The regression model was used to forecast an estimate of <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> This forecasted share of 31. 13 % was used as the mean and 3. 45 %, the standard error of the model, was used to generate a second simulation model. The simulation results indicated that 26 of 100 observations resulted in <b>market</b> <b>share</b> greater than the goal of 33 %. This indicates that there is a 26 % probability of achieving or exceeding the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal based on results using regression to predict future <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and variability in <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> The second simulation model generated from the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> forecast and standard error from the regression model produced the better results.

5000|$|In Canadian {{agricultural}} policy, the <b>Market</b> <b>Sharing</b> Quota (MSQ) is {{the federally}} determined {{target for the}} amount of industrial milk to produce nationwide each year as part of its policy of supply management.

Provincial shares of the national quota are adjusted in line with changes in the total and each province allocates its share to its producers according to its own quota policies. The Canadian Dairy Commission sets a target price for industrial milk based on production costs, including a return to labour, capital and management. Dairy farmers receive a payment from their provincial marketing board on in-quota deliveries of industrial milk. Farmers who produce in excess of their quota do not receive payments and in some provinces, may face a financial penalty.

5000|$|Article 101(1) TFEU then gives {{examples}} of [...] "hard core" [...] restrictive {{practices such as}} price fixing or <b>market</b> <b>sharing</b> and 101(2) TFEU confirms that any agreements are automatically void. However, just like the Statute of Monopolies 1623, Article 101(3) TFEU creates exemptions, if the collusion is for distributional or technological innovation, gives consumers a [...] "fair share" [...] of the benefit and does not include unreasonable restraints (or disproportionate, in ECJ terminology) that risk eliminating competition anywhere. Article 102 TFEU deals with monopolies, or more precisely firms who have a dominant market share and abuse that position. Unlike U.S. Antitrust, EU law has never been used to punish the existence of dominant firms, but merely imposes a special responsibility to conduct oneself appropriately. Specific categories of abuse listed in Article 102 EC include price discrimination and exclusive dealing, {{much the same as}} sections 2 and 3 of the U.S. Clayton Act. Also under Article 102 EC, the European Council was empowered to enact a regulation to control mergers between firms, currently the latest known by the abbreviation of ECMR [...] "Reg. 139/2004". The general test is whether a concentration (i.e. merger or acquisition) with a community dimension (i.e. affects a number of EU member states) might significantly impede effective competition. Again, the similarity to the Clayton Act's substantial lessening of competition. Finally, Articles 106 and 107 TFEU regulate the state's role in the market. Article 106(2) EC states clearly that nothing in the rules cannot be used to obstruct a member state's right to deliver public services, but that otherwise public enterprises must play by the same rules on collusion and abuse of dominance as everyone else. Article 107 TFEU, similar to Article 101 TFEU, lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidise private parties in distortion of free competition, but then grants exceptions for things like charities, natural disasters or regional development.|$|E
