2500|$|... "Skaer {{was one of}} the {{highlights}} of this art year for <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> is of the 2009 Turner Prize show." [...] - Charles Darwent, The Independent.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was criticized}} {{throughout}} her career for being uneven with her talent in writing, something she recognized in herself, and that reflected periods {{of depression and}} artistic frustration. She {{has been described as}} having unique sensibilities; she wrote of feeling [...] "vibrations" [...] from the land, and often preferred long periods of solitude at Cross Creek. She was known for being remarkably strong-willed, but after her death, Norton Baskin wrote of her, [...] "Marjorie was the shyest person I have ever known. This was always strange to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could stand up to anybody in any department of endeavor but time after time when she was asked to go some place or to do something she would accept -'if I would go with her.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Fairuz's son, Ziad Rahbani, sparked {{controversy}} in December 2013 {{during an interview}} with the Al-Ahed website when asked whether his mother shared his supportive stance on the political vision of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, a dominant but highly controversial political and military force in Lebanon. Ziad replied: [...] "Fairuz is very fond of Sayyed Hassan , although she will be displeased with <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was after my last television interview, when I revealed some personal information and she quickly interrupted me". There were strong reactions to this statement, which went viral on social media, and the country's different media outlets did not deviate from their political stances when reacting to Ziad's words. Politicians and celebrities stepped in as well, some of whom objected to affiliating Fairuz to one side of Lebanon's political divide over another, including Druze leader Walid Jumblatt who said: [...] "Fairuz is too great to be criticized, {{and at the same time}} too great to be classified as belonging to this or that political camp". [...] "Let us keep her in her supreme position, and not push her to something she has nothing to do with," [...] Jumblatt added. Ziad, who claims to speak on his mother's behalf [...] "because she prefers to remain silent", responded to his critics by saying: [...] "Apparently it isn’t allowed in the age of strife for the princess of classy Arab art to voice love for the master of resistance". Nasrallah, commenting on the issue during a speech, stated: [...] "An educated highly respected thinker and artist, who maybe espoused different ideologies, might disagree with you on political matters, but personally have [...] fondness for you, because of your character, conduct, sacrifices and so on. If such a person were to say that he or she liked someone, then all hell would break loose".|$|E
60|$|She ran to meet <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> {{had been}} my daughter; <b>she</b> kissed <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> {{had been my}} daughter; she fondly looked up at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> had been my daughter. At the sight of that sweet young face, so sorrowful, and so patiently {{enduring}} sorrow, all my doubts and hesitations, everything artificial about me with which I had entered the room, vanished in an instant.|$|R
6000|$|She {{does not}} come to greet <b>me</b> so frankly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> did, [...] And in her utmost {{openness}} I feel there's something hid; [...] She almost seems to shun <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> thought that I [...] Might win her gentle heart again to feelings long gone by.|$|R
60|$|My {{mother looked}} at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> doubted the {{evidence}} of her own senses.|$|R
60|$|She was {{far above}} the paltry {{affectation}} of being confused. She answered <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> might have answered a brother or a father.|$|E
60|$|She {{asked in}} her coaxing way, kissing <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{used to do}} at school when {{she wanted me to}} do {{anything}} for her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Minerva {{came back}} to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had promised. 'It is well,' she said gravely, 'that the doctor has been to see you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{the door}} before me opened, I saw a colored woman. I was utterly discomfited. None of my rules applied to a middle-aged colored woman, who gazed upon <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> {{recognized}} <b>me</b> <b>as</b> one whom <b>she</b> carried in her arms when an infant. Actuated by impulse only, I inquired for [...] "Miss Raynor." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> joined <b>me,</b> and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> did so I noted, a sour grin on Mr. Pike's face.|$|R
60|$|She {{lifted her}} {{face from the}} floor, and looked at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> doubted whether she had heard aright.|$|R
60|$|She {{had a way}} {{of looking}} one in the eyes and {{demanding}} the truth, and thus she looked at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> asked the question.|$|E
6000|$|Mary gave {{a little}} exclamation at hearing this, and she almost laughed. After a short pause she blushed brightly, and turned to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> said-- ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{lifted her}} eyes full upon <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> spoke. I stammered out, like one spell-bound, [...] "I must {{certainly}} go, on your recommendation, Mdlle. Césarine." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} imagine why Dora had been making tempting little faces at <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> wanted to kiss me.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Pharaoh, {{though one}} night old Bakenkhonsu vowed that he {{perceived}} her passing before us, {{and looking at}} <b>me</b> earnestly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> passed." ...|$|R
60|$|Ally looked coquettishly at <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> did {{not know}} whether she should favor me to that extent, and the young princess was further solicited.|$|R
60|$|This {{letter was}} handed {{to my wife}} at dinner-time, and she gave it to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> passed {{out of the room}} with the other ladies.|$|E
6000|$|Margaret {{shook her}} head privily to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> gazed at our bending royal- yards, but {{was caught in the}} act by Mr. Pike, who cried out: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rumour {{has many}} tongues, Augustus," [...] I answered. [...] "At least I {{fell from the}} Empress's favour, and she rewarded <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> held that I deserved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot say {{for certain}} yet, sir, {{but it looks}} to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> is French. I don't think that the sails are English cut anyhow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"'Tis my belief," [...] said Steve, [...] "that they wouldn't {{particularly}} object. Your Emily clung <b>as</b> {{close to}} <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> already belonged to me, dear girl." ...|$|R
60|$|What a {{delightful}} woman! as I said just now. I asked if <b>she</b> really liked <b>me</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>she</b> liked my sister.|$|R
6000|$|I made a garland for her head, [...] And bracelets too, and {{fragrant}} zone, [...] She look'd at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> did love [...] And made sweet moan.|$|E
60|$|I {{would present}} my humble service to my Lady Mountcashel; but truly I {{thought she would}} have made {{advances}} to have been acquainted with <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> pretended.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Joe {{wants me}} to but I can't. Mother's last words to <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> lay on her dying-bed, were, [...] "Never, never run away, Miranda," [...] and I promised.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Darling mother, you haven't any {{too many}} of them, have you?" [...] she murmured; and <b>she</b> gave <b>me,</b> sidelong, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> left us, the prettiest half-comical, half-pitiful smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who are you?" [...] she cried, facing <b>me</b> resolutely <b>as</b> <b>she</b> set {{her foot}} on the stile. [...] "How dare you frighten a poor {{helpless}} woman like that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is a gay figure, Pip," [...] said she, {{making her}} crutch stick play round <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she,</b> the fairy godmother who had changed me, were bestowing the {{finishing}} gift.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt that}} was one reason why she {{received}} <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> did; but she had another, which she communicated {{to me in the}} plainest terms--the difference in our rank of life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, do {{you know}} I thought it looked like him," [...] was Harris' comment. [...] "And, {{come to think of}} it, that boat got as far away from <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could." ...|$|E
60|$|She leant {{forward over}} the table, staring blankly. But {{presently}} her half-averted face began to haunt <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had {{sat at the}} table, and her arm and the long droop of her shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Dartle {{glanced at}} <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> though <b>she</b> would inquire {{if there were}} {{anything}} that I desired to ask. As there was something which had occurred to my mind, I said in reply: ...|$|R
60|$|TANNER. Stand by her! What {{danger is}} she in? She has {{the law on}} her side; she has popular {{sentiment}} on her side; she has plenty of money and no conscience. All she wants with me is to load up all her moral responsibilities on <b>me,</b> and do <b>as</b> <b>she</b> likes {{at the expense of}} my character. I can't control her; and <b>she</b> can compromise <b>me</b> <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>she</b> likes. I might as well be her husband.|$|R
6000|$|... "After all, {{it is the}} brig {{that will}} want you. She will never change. The finest craft afloat in these seas. She will carry <b>me</b> about <b>as</b> <b>she</b> did before, but [...] ." ...|$|R
