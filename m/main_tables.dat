50|$|The <b>main</b> <b>tables</b> or main {{schedules}} {{containing the}} various disciplines and branches of knowledge, arranged in 9 main classes, numbered from 0 to 9 (with class 4 being vacant). At {{the beginning of}} each class there are also series of special auxiliaries, which express aspects that are recurrent within this specific class. <b>Main</b> <b>tables</b> in UDC contain more than 60,000 subdivisions.|$|E
50|$|Inserting into a {{junction}} table involves multiple steps: first inserting {{into the}} <b>main</b> <b>table(s),</b> then updating the junction table.|$|E
50|$|Common {{auxiliary}} tables (including certain auxiliary signs). These tables contain facets of concepts representing, general recurrent characteristics, applicable over {{a range of}} subjects throughout the <b>main</b> <b>tables,</b> including notions such as place, language {{of the text and}} physical form of the document, which may occur in almost any subject. UDC numbers from these tables, called common auxiliaries are simply added {{at the end of the}} number for the subject taken from the <b>main</b> <b>tables.</b> There are over 15,000 of common auxiliaries in UDC.|$|E
50|$|To add further flexibility, {{more than}} one <b>main</b> <b>table</b> is allowed, with <b>main</b> and submain <b>tables</b> having a one-to-many relation. Each <b>main</b> <b>table</b> can have its own {{dimension}} tables. To provide further query optimization, a data set can be partitioned into separate physical schemas on either the same database server or different database servers.|$|R

50|$|The <b>main</b> <b>tables</b> below show {{municipalities}} at {{the town}} level, differentiating between towns and cities. For any census, adding up the totals for each town-level municipality should yield the county total. A separate section follows with population totals for villages from 1930 to 2000.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relation}} of the central table {{to those in the}} dimension tables is one-to-many or in some cases many-to-many rather than many-to-one; the primary keys of the central table are the foreign keys in dimension tables, and the <b>main</b> <b>tables</b> are in general, smaller than the dimension tables.|$|E

25|$|The ranking {{consists}} of two separate tables. The ten ICC Full Members that play Test cricket are automatically listed on the <b>main</b> <b>table.</b> The six Associate Members with One Day International status are listed on a secondary table, but are eligible for promotion to the <b>main</b> <b>table</b> by meeting certain criteria.|$|R

50|$|The <b>main</b> <b>tables</b> below show {{municipalities}} at {{the town}} level, differentiating between towns and cities. For any census, adding up the totals for each town-level municipality (as well as Buel’s Gore) should yield the county total. A separate section follows with population totals for villages from 1930 to 2000.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the large}} extent of unorganized {{territory}} in Essex County, a separate section with detailed historical census totals for such areas follows the <b>main</b> <b>tables</b> below. In {{most of the last}} several censuses prior to 2000, the population of the unorganized territory had typically been about 30 residents. In 2000, it increased to 51.|$|E

For any census, adding up the totals for each town-level municipality (as well as Avery’s Gore, for the 1970 and earlier censuses) should yield the county total. A separate section follows with population totals for villages from 1930 to 2000.|$|E
50|$|Any changes due to byelections {{are shown}} below the <b>main</b> <b>table</b> showing the {{theoretical}} {{composition of the}} House after the election. A final table showing {{the composition of the}} House at the dissolution of the Legislature {{at the end of this}} Parliament can be found below the byelections. The <b>main</b> <b>table</b> represents the immediate results of the election only, not changes in governing coalitions or eventual changes due to byelections.|$|R

5000|$|The {{roster of}} Unorganized Territories in Hancock County {{has not changed}} since Unorganized Territories were first created for the 1970 Census. [...] The listings below provide {{population}} figures for 1) all unincorporated territory, including plantations; 2) organized plantations, for which breakouts {{are available in the}} <b>main</b> <b>tables</b> above; and 3) unorganized territory, with any available breakouts provided.|$|E
50|$|This table summarises the {{chronology}} of the <b>main</b> <b>tables</b> {{and serves as}} a guide to the historical periods mentioned. Much of the Hebrew Bible or the Protocanonical Old Testament may have been assembled in the 5th century BCE. The New Testament books were composed largely {{in the second half of}} the 1st century CE. The Deuterocanon falls largely in between.|$|E
5000|$|In PostgreSQL 9.2 and later, index-only scans often {{allow the}} system to fetch data from indexes without ever having to access the <b>main</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
50|$|As they store only single {{pieces of}} data, rather than entire rows, indexes are {{generally}} {{much smaller than}} the <b>main</b> <b>table</b> stores. Scanning this smaller set of data reduces the number of disk operations. If the index is heavily used, it can dramatically reduce the time for common operations. However, maintaining indexes adds overhead to the system, especially when new data is written to the database. Records not only need to be stored in the <b>main</b> <b>table,</b> but any attached indexes have to be updated as well.|$|R
50|$|The <b>main</b> <b>table</b> {{includes}} abbeys, priories and friaries, including alien houses, monastic granges, cells, and camerae of {{the military}} orders of monks (Templars and Hospitallers). Hospitals and colleges are listed separately.|$|R
50|$|Two <b>main</b> <b>tables</b> {{of opinion}} polls are shown below. The top table lists opinion polls taken in 2016, the {{election}} year, and includes all political parties with Dáil representation, plus the Green Party. The second table, for polls {{from the last}} general election in 2011 up to 2015, does not break out Renua Ireland or the Social Democrats, which were both founded in 2015.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>main</b> <b>tables</b> below show {{municipalities}} at {{the town}} level. For any census, adding up the totals for each town-level municipality should yield the county total. The tables in the New England Historical U.S. Census Totals series differentiate between towns and cities; however, there have never been any cities in Grand Isle County. A separate section follows with population totals for villages from 1930 to 2000.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the large}} extent of unorganized {{territory}} in Coos County, a separate section with detailed historical census totals for such areas follows the <b>main</b> <b>tables</b> below. Note that Wentworth's Location was incorporated as a town for many years, although it never dropped the word “location” from its name. In recent censuses, {{the population of the}} unorganized territory (including Wentworth's Location) has typically been between 100 and 200 residents.|$|E

50|$|Some unincorporated {{territory}} in Maine is organized into a third type of town-level municipality unique to Maine, called a plantation (considered to be “organized”, but not incorporated), while some is entirely unorganized. Due {{to the large}} extent of unincorporated {{territory in}} Franklin County, separate sections with detailed historical census totals for such areas follow the <b>main</b> <b>tables</b> below. For any census, adding up the totals for each town-level municipality, including any plantations or unorganized entities, should yield the county total.|$|E

40|$|This paper mainly {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} 360 [*]MN extrusion machine and focuses on the stabilization control of <b>main</b> <b>table</b> attitude. We will first introduce the problem and then model the extrusion machine. As the machine is a multi-input multioutput (MIMO) and strong coupling system, {{it is challenging to}} apply existing control theory to design a controller to stabilize the <b>main</b> <b>table</b> attitude. Motivated by recent research in the field of multiagent systems, we design a consensus control protocol for our system and derive our convergence conditions based directly on Routh stability criterion. The advantages of the design are also demonstrated by numerical simulation...|$|R
