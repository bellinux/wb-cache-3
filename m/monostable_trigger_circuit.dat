40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a solution for}} battery-less power management circuits for micro-power energy converters, allowing energy harvesting systems to operate under continuous and intermittent conditions. The proposed <b>trigger</b> <b>circuit</b> is a fully passive, normally open, single pole, single throw, analog switch driven by a nano-power CMOS control unit. The <b>trigger</b> <b>circuit</b> starts in an OPEN state until the voltage, at its input terminal, reaches a high threshold, when it toggles to the CLOSED state. Once the input voltage drops below a low threshold, the <b>trigger</b> <b>circuit</b> returns to the OPEN state. In the CLOSED state, the <b>trigger</b> <b>circuit</b> creates a low resistance path between the input and output terminals, while at the OPEN state the input is isolated from the output. A first prototype was breadboarded by using discrete components {{for the sake of}} performance evaluation. Low threshold voltages (2. 15 V and 1. 15 V), sub-ohm CLOSED-state resistance, and power consumption requirements (in the order of 55. 9 and 167. 7 nW), coupled with relatively high energy extraction capabilities are confirmed by experimental results.

50|$|A typical CDI module {{consists}} of a small transformer, a charging <b>circuit,</b> a <b>triggering</b> <b>circuit</b> and a main capacitor. First, the system voltage is raised up to 250 to 600 volts by a power supply inside the CDI module. Then, the electric current flows to the charging circuit and charges the capacitor. The rectifier inside the charging circuit prevents capacitor discharge before the moment of ignition. When the <b>triggering</b> <b>circuit</b> receives the <b>triggering</b> signal, the <b>triggering</b> <b>circuit</b> stops {{the operation of the}} charging circuit, allowing the capacitor to discharge its output rapidly to the low inductance ignition coil. In a CD ignition, the ignition coil acts as a pulse transformer rather than an energy storage medium as it does in an inductive system. The voltage output to the spark plugs is highly dependent on the design of the CD ignition. Voltages exceeding the insulation capabilities of existing ignition components can lead to early failure of those components. Most CD ignitions are made to give very high output voltages, but this is not always beneficial. When there's no triggering signal, the charging circuit is re-connected to charge the capacitor.|$|R
