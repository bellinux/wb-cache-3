500|$|Maximian {{retired to}} villas in Campania or Lucania. Their homes were distant from {{political}} life, but Diocletian and Maximian were {{close enough to}} remain in regular contact with each other. Galerius assumed the consular fasces in 308 with Diocletian as his colleague. In the autumn of 308, Galerius again conferred with Diocletian at Carnuntum (Petronell-Carnuntum, Austria). Diocletian and Maximian were both present on 11 November 308, to see Galerius appoint Licinius to be augustus in place of Severus, who had died {{at the hands of}} Maxentius. He ordered Maximian, who had attempted to return to power after his retirement, to step down permanently. At Carnuntum people begged Diocletian to return to the throne, to resolve the conflicts that had arisen through Constantine's rise to power and Maxentius' usurpation. Diocletian's reply: [...] "If you could show the cabbage that I planted with <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> to your emperor, he definitely wouldn't dare suggest that I replace the peace and happiness of this place with the storms of a never-satisfied greed." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of March 29, 1825, a firing squad was {{assembled}} {{to carry out the}} sentence handed down to the pirates. The public execution, which had a large number of spectators, was supervised by the Regimiento de Infantería de Granada between eight and nine a.m. Catholic priests were present to hear confessions and offer comfort. As the pirates prayed, they were shot before the silent crowd. Although San Felipe del Morro is the accepted execution site, Alejandro Tapia y Rivera (whose father {{was a member of the}} Regimiento de Granada) places their execution near Convento Dominico in the Baluarte de Santo Domingo (part of present-day Old San Juan). According to historian Enrique Ramírez Brau, in a final act of defiance Cofresí refused to have his eyes covered after he was tied to a chair and he was blindfolded by soldiers. Richard Wheeler said that the pirate said that after killing three or four hundred people, it would be strange if he was not accustomed to death. Cofresí's last words were reportedly, [...] "I have killed hundreds with <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands,</b> and I know how to die. Fire!" ...|$|E
500|$|Struthers {{held the}} {{professorship}} at Aberdeen for 26 years. In that time, he radically transformed anatomy {{teaching at the}} university, improved the Aberdeen medical school; set up the museum of anatomy; and helped to lead {{the reconstruction of the}} Aberdeen Infirmary. He vigorously collected specimens for his museum, [...] "prepared or otherwise provided, mainly by the work of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands,</b> and at my own expense". The specimens were arranged to enable students to compare the anatomy of different animals. He intended the comparative anatomy exhibits to demonstrate evolution through the presence of homologous structures. For example, in mammals, the arm and hand of a human, the wing of a bird, the foreleg of a horse, and the flipper of a whale are all homologous forelimbs. He continually made demands of the University of Aberdeen's Senate for additional room space and money for the museum, against the wishes of his colleagues in the faculty. Struthers could {{go to great lengths to}} obtain specimens he particularly wanted, and on at least one occasion this led to court action. He had long admired a crocodile skeleton at Aberdeen's Medico-Chirurgical Society. In 1866 he borrowed it, ostensibly to clean and remount it, but despite the society's urgent requests to have it returned, it stayed in Struthers' museum at Marischal College for ten years. Struthers still hoped to obtain the specimen, and when in 1885 he was made president of the Medico-Chirurgical Society, he again tried to take the crocodile to his museum. The society then obtained an interdict (a court order) restraining him from removing the skeleton.|$|E

Upon {{completing}} his doctoral studies in law, he began to travel broadly throughout North Africa, Arabia, and Europe. He showed interest in becoming a travel author, and this led to his optimistically joining the armed forces in order to [...] "hold the helm of my life in <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands.</b> I shall see Baghdad, the Tigris, Mossul, Babylon.

2500|$|Marcus {{probably}} {{began his}} {{education at the}} age of seven. He was taught at home, in line with contemporary aristocratic trends; Marcus thanks Catilius Severus for encouraging him to avoid public schools. Three of his childhood tutors are known: Euphoric, Geminus, and an unnamed educator. These three are otherwise unattested in the ancient sources, and would probably have been household slaves or freedmen. Since Euphoric had a Greek name, he probably taught Marcus the basics of that language. (He is said to have taught Marcus literature.) Geminus is described as an actor, and he may have taught Marcus Latin pronunciation and general elocution. The educator would have been Marcus' overall supervisor, charged with his moral welfare and general development. Marcus speaks of him with admiration in his Meditations: he taught him to [...] "bear pain and be content with little; to work with <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands,</b> to mind my own business, to be slow to listen to slander".|$|E
