40|$|Background: Tobacco use {{became an}} {{ingrained}} habit in the United States (US) following the First World War {{and a large}} proportion of physicians,similar to the general population, were smokers. The period from 1949 to 1984 was a pivotal era of change however, as the medical profession,like the society it served, became increasingly aware of the dangers that tobacco incurred for health. Methods: An extensive review targeted all manuscripts published in academic journals between 1949 and 1984 that related to tobacco smoking among US physicians. The study was undertaken in 2007 – 08 with an internet search of relevant medical databases,after which time the reference lists of manuscripts were also examined to find additional articles. Results: A total of 57 manuscripts met the inclusion criteria. From a research perspective,the <b>methodology</b> <b>and</b> <b>coverage</b> of smoking surveys ranged from detailed national investigations,to local medical association surveys,and journal readership questionnaires. From a historical perspective,it can be seen that by the 1950 s many US physicians had begun questioning the safety of tobacco products, and by the 1960 s and 1970 s, this had resulted in a continuous decline in tobacco use. By the 1980 s, few US physicians were still smoking, and many of their younger demographic had probably never smoked at all. Conclusion: Although the quality and coverage of historical surveys varied over time, a review of their main results indicates a clear and consistent decline in tobacco use among US physicians between 1949 and 1984. Much can be learned from this pivotal era of public health, where the importance of scientific knowledge, professional leadership and social responsibility helped set positive examples in the fight against tobacco...|$|E

40|$|Female farmers play a {{vital role}} in African agriculture, {{accounting}} for 60 to 80 percent of the agricultural workforce. However, agricultural research and higher education are disproportionately led by men. There is an urgent need for a greater representation of women in the field of agricultural science and technology (S&T) in Sub-Saharan Africa. Female scientists, professors, and senior managers offer different insights and perspectives to help research institutes to more fully address the unique and pressing challenges of both female and male farmers in the region. Gender-disaggregated data on S&T capacity are scarce, often lack sufficient detail, and focus more generally on S&T rather than on agriculture specifically. Data are not always comparable due to different <b>methodologies</b> <b>and</b> <b>coverage.</b> The Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators (ASTI) initiative and the CGIAR Gender & Diversity (G&D) Program partnered together to address this information gap.

40|$|The {{design of}} a Soil Monitoring Network (SMN) poses {{numerous}} scientific challenges, especially {{for the assessment of}} national or continental areas. The task is particularly challenging because soil carbon content and stocks are driven by controlling factors of disparate origins and scales. Various approaches to the establishment of SMNs are reviewed here. Frameworks for soil monitoring exist in numerous countries, especially in Europe. Although some countries work using standard monitoring <b>methodologies</b> <b>and</b> <b>coverage,</b> there is considerable variation in approaches to the monitoring of soil carbon even within a country. In addition to achieving harmonization, there are generic issues which must be addressed when SMNs are established and operated: the SMN should be effective for different soils, and it must enable the detection of change in soil carbon at relevant spatial and temporal scales with adequate precision and statistical power. We present examples which address these issues and summarize previous reviews on this topic. It is essential to establish an adequate sampling protocol which can be applied at each sampling location and time. The design must address the questions that the user of data has and provide information with accuracy and precision at the spatial and temporal scales that match the users' needs. Furthermore, the design must match the methods of analysis so that statistical assumptions can be justified. At the global scale, the question of harmonizing sampling and analytical methods is difficult. Here, we propose the establishment of benchmark sites devoted to harmonization and inter-calibration. We present a case study from France which addresses scientific issues such as how many calibration sites are necessary and how they should be selected...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{medium-term}} perspective for analysing the trade openness - inequality relationship in Latin America. We present three contributions. The {{first is that}} we assemble a database on income distribution indicators systematically estimated from household surveys with emphasis on within-country consistency of <b>methodology,</b> definitions, <b>and</b> <b>coverage</b> for the years 1980 - 2010. This 30 -year database allows observing clearly that the increases in inequality throughout the 1980 s and 1990 s decades have been almost totally counteracted by the improvements during the first 10 years of the twenty-first century: 75 per cent of the deterioration in income distribution was reversed {{in the first decade}} of 2000. The second is an estimation of the association between trade openness and income distribution over the 30 -year period. Our central conclusion in this regard is that greater trade openness is associated with contemporaneous increases in inequality in the region. The third is that trade openness contributed - together with other factors - to the increase in inequality during the 1980 s and 1990 s, but once fully implemented, it did not lead to further rises in inequality, and did not represent a permanent obstacle to improvements in income distribution triggered by other factors such as greater education levels across the population...|$|R

Details are available from the Teaching Resources and Materials for Social Scientists (TRAMSS) website. Cohort Thirteen: The methodology of the YCS changed at Cohort Thirteen, to allow linkage with the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE) (held at the UK Data Archive under SN 5545). Samples for Cohort Thirteen and LSYPE were taken from the same academic cohort and their questionnaires and methodology were harmonised to facilitate analysis of the merged datasets. Also, from Cohort Thirteen onwards, the YCS is only conducted in England and no longer runs in Wales. The larger sample from the combined YCS and LSYPE surveys enables analysis at a greater level of detail, for example to show gender differences within a breakdown by ethnic origin. The data collection method for Cohort Thirteen was different to previous YCS surveys. Sweep One used a face-to-face methodology in order to address falling response rates on recent YCS cohorts. Sweeps Two, Three and Four were conducted using a mixed-mode methodology (online, telephone and face-to-face interviewing). In particular, there had been concern over differential response rates between high attainers and low attainers, and it was considered that the use of a face-to-face method at Sweep One mixed-mode at Sweeps Two to Four, would boost response rates amongst low attainers. Users who require more detailed data than those available in the standard access files should consult the User Guide for details. The confidentiality form to be used for such applications is available in Word format in the documentation table below. For the second edition (February 2011), data and documentation from Sweeps Two and Three were added to the study. For the third edition (February 2012), data and documentation from Sweep Four were added. Main Topics : Sweep One mainly concentrated on identifying respondents' experiences of year 11 including careers advice; economic activity, their activity history; qualifications sought, information on Higher Education, a self completion section (covering risky behaviours) as well as some background information about their families and attitudes. Sweep Two focused on current activities; jobs and training; qualifications being studied for at time of interview; higher education; young people Not in Employment, Education or Training (NEET); Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA); community cohesion; own children and caring responsibilities.

All cohort members who had achieved Level 2 qualifications by the end of Year 11 received the core questionnaire and the 'Higher Education' (HE) module, covering: whether respondent applied for HE; gap years; decisions about HE; reasons for not applying for HE; sources of information/advice about HE; background factors surrounding HE decision. Sweep Three Sweep Three, conducted in 2002, included a postal questionnaire which aimed to: record current activities of young people and identify all education, training and labour market activities engaged in; track the routes respondents have taken through education, training and the labour market since previous sweeps; record all qualifications gained and courses entered but not completed since the previous sweep and qualifications currently being studied. The questionnaire structure was therefore as follows: views about work and education respondents current activities / activities since January 2001 qualifications obtained since January 2001 full-time education part-time education qualifications being studied for now jobs and training work, earnings and looking for work on-the-job and off-the job training household details contact details - including the collection of an email address for the first time.

Cross-country evidence shows that on average HHS and NAS provide similar estimates of consumption levels and growth. There is an enormous dispersion underlying this average, and in any given country the NAS and HHS estimates of consumption levels or growth may diverge by a wide margin.

40|$|There {{have been}} studies on how pastoralists assess and choose the {{resources}} required for their livestock, but little research analysing whether livestock are matched to the available resources in a seasonal migratory system by an entire pastoral community over a year. This paper reports {{a case study}} of pastoralists in Kazakhstan which shows how the inter-relation of biophysical, institutional and economic factors results in the imperfect matching of livestock numbers to the distribution of forage resources. The research is based on a three-year study using anthropological interviews, formal survey data, and remotely sensed data covering all livestock (25, 000 smallstock and approximately 2, 300 cattle, horses and camels) in a study area of 60, 000 km 2 for an entire annual cycle; a combination of <b>methodologies</b> <b>and</b> geographical <b>coverage</b> that provides a comprehensive estimation of the factors that influence the pastoral exploitation of this human-managed, complex ecosystem. The research finds that the pastoralists are subject to a number of limitations in using biophysical niches which might otherwise provide the best feed and water resources for their animals at a particular season and site. Different ecozones offer seasonally-shifting advantages and disadvantages for the livestock, but livestock owners are also economically differentiated. The interplay between economic and biophysical factors exemplifies the multi-faceted character of pastoralists’ decision-making about site selection within a relatively open rangeland tenure system. Only those with the largest livestock holdings distribute their livestock {{to take advantage of the}} best seasonal resources. Despite the wide availability of biophysically suitable sites, most livestock owners’ choices are compromised and therefore frequently suboptimal, prompting the conclusion that natural resource matching is constrained...|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} contains {{estimates of}} Australian public funding for arts and cultural activities, facilities and services across {{three levels of}} government for 2008 - 09 and 2007 - 08. The survey of Cultural Funding by Government, 2008 - 09 collected information on recurrent and capital expenditure by Australian and state government departments (including selected authorities, corporations and councils) for heritage and arts cultural activities, facilities and services. Funding data in this publication are aligned, where possible, with the categories specified in the Industry Classification of the Australian Culture and Leisure Classifications, Second edition (cat. no. 4902. 0), released in 2008. Cultural activities have been classified into two major groups: Heritage; and the Arts. Estimates reported at the Australian government, and state and territory government level for 2008 - 09 and 2007 - 08 are not comparable with data prior to 2007 - 08 due to changes in <b>methodology,</b> scope <b>and</b> <b>coverage</b> of the collection implemented for the 2007 - 08 collection. Prior to the 2007 - 08 collection, estimates were compiled from administrative by-product data obtained by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) from annual reports and budget papers, and from information provided by selected Australian Government authorities and state and territory governments. From 2007 - 08, estimates have been compiled using information provided directly to the ABS via an electronic-form which is sent to all in-scope government departments (including selected agencies, authorities and corporations). Local government funding data is obtained by the ABS from state and territory Local Government Grants Commissions data, or equivalent. The local government data is classified according to the Local Government Purpose Classification (LGPC). During {{the course of the}} 2008 - 09 collection, expenditure reported by some government departments for 2007 - 08 was revised. These data revisions for 2007 - 08 have been included in this release...|$|R

40|$|Female farmers play a {{vital role}} in African agriculture, {{accounting}} for the majority of the agricultural workforce. However, agricultural research and higher education are disproportionately led by men. There is an urgent need for greater representation of women in the field of agricultural science and technology (S&T) in Sub-Saharan Africa. Female scientists, professors, and senior managers offer different insights and perspectives to help research institutes to more fully address the unique and pressing challenges of both female and male farmers in the region. Gender-disaggregated data on S&T capacity are scarce, often lack sufficient detail, and focus more generally on S&T rather than on agriculture specifically. Data are not always comparable due to different <b>methodologies</b> <b>and</b> <b>coverage.</b> The Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators (ASTI) initiative and the CGIAR Gender & Diversity (G&D) Program partnered together to address this information gap. This report presents the results of an in-depth benchmarking survey on gender-disaggregated capacity indicators, covering 125 agricultural research and higher education agencies in 15 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. This is the first study of its kind to present detailed human resources data on female participation in agricultural science, the main findings of which include the following: • Total capacity in terms of the professional staff employed at the agricultural research and higher education agencies included in this study increased by 20 percent between 2000 / 01 and 2007 / 08, and women constituted almost half of this capacity increase. The female population of professional staff grew by eight percent per year on average, which is four times higher than the comparable rate of increase for the male population, indicating that the gender gap in African agricultural sciences is closing. • The proportion of female professional staff employed at the sample agricultural research and higher education agencies increased from 18 percent in 2000 / 01 to 24 percent in 2007 / 08, but fewer women have advanced degrees compared to their male colleagues. In 2007 / 08, for example, 27 percent of the sample’s professional women held PhD degrees compared with 37 percent of the sample’s professional men. • Of concern, about two-thirds of the overall (female and male) capacity increase comprised staff holding only BSc degrees, indicating that the overall quality of capacity in agricultural research and higher education is declining in some Sub-Saharan African countries. Notably, the total number of male professional staff trained to the MSc level declined between 2000 / 01 and 2007 / 08; however, more in-depth analysis is needed to explain the underlying causes of these shifts and to what degree they represent structural changes. • Levels of female participation in agricultural research and higher education among the sample agencies were particularly low in Ethiopia (6 percent), Togo (9 percent), Niger (10 percent), and Burkina Faso (12 percent). Shares of female professional staff were much higher in South Africa, Mozambique, and Botswana (32, 35, and 41 percent, respectively). • The female share of students enrolled in higher agricultural education was higher than the female shares of professional staff employed at the agricultural research and higher education agencies in most cases, but a significant proportion of the female students concerned were undertaking only BSc-level studies (83 percent). • Only 14 percent of the management positions were held by women, which is considerably lower than the share of female professional staff employed at the sample’s agricultural research and higher education agencies (24 percent). • The pool of female staff is much younger on average than the pool of male staff. • The prevalence of female professional staff is comparatively higher in fields related to life and social sciences, and comparatively lower in fields involving areas traditionally thought of as “hard science”, such as engineering. agricultural R&D, Sub-Saharan Africa, female participation, S&T capacity, agricultural higher education,...|$|R
