5|$|This {{formulation}} {{requires that}} actions {{be considered as}} if their maxim {{is to provide a}} law for a hypothetical Kingdom of Ends. Accordingly, people have an obligation to act upon principles that a community of rational agents would accept as laws. In such a community, each individual would only accept maxims that can govern every <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> without treating any member merely as a means to an end. Although the Kingdom of Ends is an ideal—the actions of other people and events of nature ensure that actions with good intentions sometimes result in harm—we are still required to act categorically, as legislators of this ideal kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Drawn by the city's prosperous economy, the Blackburns {{relocated}} to Natchez, Mississippi, in 1847. Luke Blackburn quickly became an active <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> helping found a temperance society, joining a militia group, and becoming {{the administrator of}} a local hospital. He became a close associate of Jefferson Davis and William Johnson. In 1848, Blackburn served as the city's health officer and implemented the first successful quarantine against a yellow fever outbreak in the Mississippi River valley. Using his own personal funds, he established a hospital for boatmen who navigated the Mississippi River. He also successfully lobbied the Congress to establish a hospital in Natchez; upon its completion in 1852, he was appointed surgeon there. In 1854, he implemented another successful quarantine against yellow fever. The Mississippi Legislature commissioned Blackburn to lobby the Louisiana State Legislature to establish a quarantine at New Orleans to protect cities along the Mississippi River; Louisiana authorized him to organize such a system.|$|E
5|$|The Community Committee may {{reject a}} {{community}} declaration {{on the ground}} that, among other things, the declarant did not apply for a COE. During a reserved election, a declaration must also be rejected if the declarant does not state {{that he or she}} considers himself or herself to be a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> to which the election is reserved. In the 2017 election which was reserved to the Malay community, the Community Committee rejected two declarations, one from a declarant who stated he belonged to the Chinese community, and one from a declarant who said he was not a member of either the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities. During a non-reserved election, potential candidates who state that they do not consider themselves to be members of the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities may be given an opportunity by the Community Committee or a Sub-Committee to submit another community declaration.|$|E
