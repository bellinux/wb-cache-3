5|$|The {{wood of the}} bending part of {{the limb}} ("dustar") must endure intense {{shearing}} stress, and denser woods such as hard maples are normally used in Turkish bows. Bamboo, and wood of the <b>mulberry</b> <b>family,</b> are traditional in China. Some composite bows have nonbending tips ("siyahs"), which need to be stiff and light; they may be made of woods such as Sitka spruce.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} types of wood that have been {{positively}} identified: teak (Tectona grandis) {{was used for the}} through-beams and is resilient to the teredo worm (the Teredinidae family), the ceiling was made from a Cupressus genus which was possibly Cupressus torulosa, the stem-post is made of rosewood from the Leguminosae family (now called the Fabaceae) and either the Dalbergia or Pterocarpus genus. The wooden box found in the stern area of the shipwreck was made from an Artocarpus genus of the family Moraceae, more commonly known as the <b>Mulberry</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E
25|$|Paper is {{both made}} {{and used to}} make crafts in Mexico. Paper-making is a skill {{that goes back to}} pre-Hispanic times. The bark of two trees are {{primarily}} used, that of the morus or <b>mulberry</b> <b>family</b> for white paper and that of the ficus or fig family for darker varieties. Traditionally, the bark was cut and scraped by men, but the making the paper itself was done by women. The process begins by washing the bark, then boiling it with ashes. It is then rinsed and beaten until the fibers knit together, then dried in the sun. Banderolas, or cut-paper banners, are hung in the streets for special occasions.|$|E

50|$|The {{sisters were}} daughters of Henry Lathrop (1811-1888), a dry-goods merchant, and Clara Stebbins Lathrop (1823-1908), a philanthropist who founded {{a home for}} aged and invalid women in Northampton. The girls’ {{grandfather}} Daniel Stebbins was a physician and entrepreneur who raised silkworms in Northampton <b>mulberry</b> groves (<b>family</b> homes were at 57 and 81 Bridge Street and 78 Pomeroy Terrace). The sisters spent early years in Savannah, where Henry ran a store and briefly manufactured Confederate uniforms. During the Civil War, the family fled to Montreal but remained financially comfortable; they studied at Bute House, and portraits of them by the society photographer William Notman survive at the McCord Museum in Montreal. The girls’ brother Dwight (1851-1887), who became a railroad cashier in New York, stole from the company {{and ended up in}} Sing Sing prison. The sisters all studied at Smith College. Clara and Susie also trained at the Académie Julian in Paris, Susie studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and Bessie attended the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art and Karl von Rydingsvard’s woodcarving classes. The sisters traveled and painted along Cape Cod and eastern Canada and, in Europe, from Norway to Venice. They gave private art lessons and taught at Smith, the Clarke School for the Deaf and nearby girls’ schools including Mary A. Burnham School, Miss Howard’s and the MacDuffie School.|$|R
40|$|Recently, much {{attention}} {{has focused on}} the application of naturally occurring crude drugs in cosmetics. From this point of view, we examined crude drugs that originated from the Moraceae <b>family.</b> <b>Mulberry</b> (Morus alba L.) leaves contain-ing many nutritional components are the best food for silk-worms. Chen et al. reported that extracts from mulberry leaves have a potent antihyperglycemic activity in diabet-ic mice. 1) N-containing sugars, 2, 3) plant hormone 4) and moracetin 5) have been isolated from mulberry leaves. Many phenolic compounds have been identified from the root bark of mulberry tree. 6) Morus alba L. also contains rutin, 7) iso-quercitrin and astragalin. 8) Recently, the root bark of Morus alba has been shown to have a skin whitening effect. Oxyresveratrol was suggested to be an active ingredient of the plant for this effect. However, components with anti-hy-perpigmentation activity from mulberry leaves have not been reported so far. In the present study, the inhibitory effects of compounds obtained from mulberry leaves on melanin biosynthesis were investigated...|$|R
50|$|The cells (laticifers) {{in which}} latex is found {{make up the}} laticiferous system, which can form in two very {{different}} ways. In many plants, the laticiferous system is formed from rows of cells laid down in the meristem of the stem or root. The cell walls between these cells are dissolved so that continuous tubes, called latex vessels, are formed. Since these vessels are made of many cells, they are known as articulated laticifers. This method of formation {{is found in the}} poppy family and in the rubber trees (Para rubber tree, members of the family Euphorbiaceae, members of the <b>mulberry</b> and fig <b>family,</b> such as the Panama rubber tree Castilla elastica), and members of the family Asteraceae. For instance, Parthenium argentatum the guayule plant, is in the tribe Heliantheae; other latex-bearing Asteraceae with articulated laticifers include members of the Cichorieae, a clade whose members produce latex, some of them in commercially interesting amounts. This includes Taraxacum kok-saghyz, a species cultivated for latex production.|$|R

In the southern and eastern Cape forests the species becomes a strangler or liane, while when found on rocky outcrops and cliffs it usually develops into a rock-splitter.|$|E
