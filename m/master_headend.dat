50|$|The {{fiber optic}} network {{extends from the}} cable operators' <b>master</b> <b>headend,</b> {{sometimes}} to regional headends, and out to a neighborhood's hubsite, and finally to a coaxial cable node which serves anywhere from 25 to 2000 homes. A <b>master</b> <b>headend</b> will usually have satellite dishes for reception of distant video signals as well as IP aggregation routers. Some master headends also house telephony equipment for providing telecommunications services to the community.|$|E
50|$|A {{regional}} or area headend/hub {{will receive the}} video signal from the <b>master</b> <b>headend</b> and add to it the public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable TV channels as required by local franchising authorities or insert targeted advertising that would appeal to a local area. The various services are encoded, modulated and upconverted onto radio frequency (RF) carriers, combined onto a single electrical signal and inserted into a broadband optical transmitter.|$|E
