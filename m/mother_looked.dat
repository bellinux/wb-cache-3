25|$|Muir {{was born}} in Calgary, Alberta, Canada into a poor family that {{frequently}} moved. She was an unwanted, unloved, and abused child. Her <b>mother</b> <b>looked</b> for ways to remove her from the family and, when Muir was eight, placed her in the Midnapore Convent for a month. Then, in 1953, her mother sent an application for Muir to be institutionalized at the Provincial Training School for Mental Defectives (also known as the Michener Centre) in Red Deer, Alberta. At that time there were no vacant beds.|$|E
25|$|Cline's privately {{published}} work Hope for high risk and rage filled children also cites family therapist and hypnotherapist Milton Erickson as a source, and reprints {{parts of a}} case of Erickson's published in 1961. The report describes {{the case of a}} divorced mother with a non-compliant son. Erickson advised the mother to sit on the child {{for hours at a time}} and to feed him only on cold oatmeal while she and a daughter ate appetizing food. The child did increase in compliance, and Erickson noted, with apparent approval, that he trembled when his <b>mother</b> <b>looked</b> at him. Cline commented, with respect to this and other cases, that in his opinion all bonds were trauma bonds. According to Cline, it illustrates the three essential components of 1) taking control, 2) the child's expression of rage; and, 3) relaxation and the development of bonding.|$|E

500|$|Albrecht the Elder was 62 or 63 [...] {{when his}} panel was painted early in 1490. Barbara's {{portrait}} {{may have been}} completed soon after, when {{she would have been}} around 39. Their son was around 18 and had just completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut, and would soon leave for Nuremberg to travel as a journeyman painter. The father panel was painted first; for aesthetic reasons Dürer may have waited a year or two until his <b>mother</b> <b>looked</b> older.|$|E
500|$|On Wednesday, March 3, 1993, in Rancho Viejo, Texas, an {{affluent}} community {{just north of}} Brownsville, Fischer woke up early {{to get ready for}} school. Just before 7:00a.m., he went to the garage and reversed his mother's car into the circular driveway at his home at 3 Cortez Avenue. He then walked toward {{the corner of the house}} and grabbed a garden hose to spray water on the car's windows, which were covered in dust. As he sprayed the car, someone came from behind and shot him twice at point-blank range with what would later be identified as a [...]38 Super pistol. One of the shots penetrated his chest and the others his brain. Fischer's <b>mother</b> <b>looked</b> out the window to see what had happened, thinking the noise came from one of the house's palm tree branches falling on the roof, or that the car had backfired. She did not see the car, and thought that perhaps her son had gone to a convenience store to pick up something, but Fischer's brother Eric told her he could see the car parked on the driveway.|$|E

2500|$|Bobo {{was born}} in French Equatorial Africa {{sometime}} in 1951. When Bobo was approximately 2 weeks old, William [...] "Gorilla Bill" [...] Said captured him after killing the gorilla's mother, an acceptable and even admired practice at the time. Bobo was the youngest gorilla ever captured at the time, and no zoo wanted to buy him. Said took Bobo {{back to his home}} in Columbus, Ohio, USA, where Said's <b>mother</b> <b>looked</b> after the infant ape. Several months later, Bill Lowman, a fisherman from Washington state, purchased Bobo from Said while looking for a chimpanzee as a present for his parents, Raymond and Jean Lowman. Bill enlisted his aunt to drive Bobo to the Lowman family home in Anacortes, a town on Fidalgo Island in Skagit County.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after he}} was born, his parents {{bought a house in}} Upper Norwood, south London. When he was 18 months old, WWII broke out and he was {{evacuated}} to Englefield Green, a small village in Surrey {{on the edge of the}} great park of Windsor Castle, where he stayed for the duration of the war. After the end of the war, he returned to the Upper Norwood house and lived there until 1950; his father taught at a school in north-east London and his <b>mother</b> <b>looked</b> after the five children full-time. He attended the local Catholic primary school, and later, following a successful performance in the 11-plus, which he took rather earlier than most, and then transferred to Wimbledon College.|$|E

Kathleen then started screaming at him and a verbal altercation took place where Kathleen Mulhall was alleged to have instructed them to ”just kill him for me" [...] Charlotte picked up a Stanley knife and struck Noor across the throat, inflicting a wound that sent him to the ground. Linda then picked up a hammer and hit him on the head a number of times. Their <b>mother</b> <b>looked</b> on but didn't participate. Noor was stabbed at least 27 times. It may have been more, but pathologists had no opportunity to examine the full body.|$|E
2500|$|Puyi had a {{standard}} Confucian education, being taught the various Confucian classics and nothing else. Puyi later wrote: [...] "I learnt nothing of mathematics, let alone science, {{and for a}} long time I had no idea where Beijing was situated". When Puyi was 13, he met his parents and siblings, all of whom had to kowtow before him as he sat upon the Dragon Throne. By this time, Puyi had forgotten what his <b>mother</b> <b>looked</b> like. Such was the awe that the Emperor was held that his younger brothr Pujie never heard his parents refer Puyi as [...] "your elder brother", who was always just the Emperor. Pujie told Behr his image of Puyi prior to meeting him was that of [...] "...a venerable old man with a beard. I couldn't believe it when I saw this boy in yellow robes sitting solemnly on the throne". It was decided that Pujie would join Puyi in the Forbidden City to provide him with a playmate, though Puyi was notably angry when he discovered his brother was wearing yellow [...] the color of the Qing [...] as he believed that only Emperors had the right to wear yellow, and it had to be explained to him that all members of the Qing family could wear yellow.|$|E
