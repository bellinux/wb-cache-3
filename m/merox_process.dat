50|$|In some of {{the above}} <b>Merox</b> <b>process</b> versions, the {{catalyst}} is a liquid. In others, the catalyst {{is in the form}} of impregnated charcoal granules.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Merox</b> <b>process</b> {{requires}} an alkaline environment which, in some process versions, {{is provided by}} an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, {{commonly referred to as}} caustic.

5000|$|As is {{the case}} with the {{conventional}} <b>Merox</b> <b>process</b> for treating LPG, the jet fuel or kerosene sweetening process also requires that the feedstock be prewashed to remove any H2S that would interfere with the sweetening.

50|$|Especially {{when dealing}} with kerosene, the <b>Merox</b> <b>process</b> is usually more {{economical}} than using a catalytic hydrodesulfurization process for much the same purpose. Indeed, it is rarely (if ever) required to reduce the sulphur content of a straight-run kerosene to respect the sulphur specification of jet fuel as the specification is 3000 ppm and very few crude oils have a kerosene cut with a higher content of sulphur than this limit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{conventional}} <b>Merox</b> <b>process</b> for {{the removal}} of mercaptans (i.e., sweetening) of jet fuel or kerosene is a one-step process. The mercaptan oxidation reaction takes place in an alkaline environment as the feedstock jet fuel or kerosene, mixed with compressed air, flows through a fixed bed of catalyst in a reactor vessel. The catalyst consists of charcoal granules that have been impregnated with UOP's proprietary catalyst. The oxidation reaction that takes place is: ...|$|E

It is a two-step process. In the first step, the feedstock LPG or light naphtha is contacted in the trayed extractor vessel with an aqueous caustic solution containing UOP's proprietary liquid catalyst. The caustic solution reacts with mercaptans and extracts them. The reaction that takes place in the extractor is: ...|$|E
50|$|The company {{contends that}} no waste was transported from Europe, and the {{incident}} was an accident caused by the mishandling by an Ivorian company of waste water used to wash the ship's storage tanks. A Dutch newspaper reported on this possibility, saying the waste could have been generated {{as a result of}} attempted on-board desulfurization (removing mercaptans) of naphtha in a Merox-like process. In this way high mercaptan-laden gasoline is upgraded to meet certain country-specific specifications. This would explain the water/caustic soda/gasoline mix and also the presence in trace amounts of a certain catalyst called ARI-100 EXLz, generally used in this process. It would on the other hand not explain the presence of hydrogen sulfide because the final stage of the <b>Merox</b> <b>process</b> is an organic disulfide unless the attempt at desulfurization had failed. The company has always contended that the amount of hydrogen sulfide in the waste was small. Press and government findings contend there was a substantial amount of hydrogen sulfide dumped, some 2 tonnes of the 500 tonnes of dumped liquid.|$|E

In this paper, the kinetic of conversion existing mercaptans in kerosene is studied for better understanding of <b>MEROX</b> <b>process.</b> Impregnated activated carbon with powder of MEROX catalyst was analyzed in laboratory scale. The results indicate that in laboratory scale, because of pore diffusion resistance, the impregnation efficiency is low. Also, optimum conditions for mercaptan extraction by using of soda solution obtained. Meanwhile the kinetic of oxidation reaction is considered in the presence of MEROX catalyst and activated carbon and also, impregnated activated carbon with MEROX catalyst. The results, indicate for mercaptan decreasing, in similar conditions the efficiency of Impregnated activated carbon with MEROX is better than other catalysts. Also, the kinetic model related to catalytic reaction for mercaptan conversion to disulfide in the presence of impregnated activated carbon with MEROX catalyst, is represented...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Mercaptans are {{commonly}} present in petroleum products. Their foul odor and highly corrosive nature make {{them the most}} undesirable sulfur compounds so they should be removed because of environmental issues. <b>Merox</b> <b>process</b> is used for oxidation of mercaptans to disulfide using air {{in the presence of}} alkaline solution and Merox catalyst. In this paper, due to lack of information about the kinetic of mercaptan oxidation, the kinetic of conversion of ethyl mercaptan in gasoline and kerosene is studied {{in order to be able}} to model and simulate this process. The experiments were carried out in a semi-batch bubble column reactor and it was proved that increasing the temperature, improves the rate of the reaction. The obtained results were analyzed and a correlation for the rate of reaction is suggested. The suggested equation is first-order with respect to mercaptan concentration...|$|E
40|$|Methods to {{investigate}} the response of hydrocarbons and sulfur compounds to different extents resulting from thermal oxidation of jet fuels refined via the mercaptan oxidation (<b>Merox)</b> <b>process</b> have been developed. Relative comparison of hydrocarbon contents including n-paraffins, isoparaffins, olefins, naphthenes, and aromatics (PIONA) was performed by using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography hyphenated with a quadrupole-accurate mass time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC × GC-Q-TOFMS). A simple approach for quantification of sulfur compound groups was then developed using both GC × GC and GC hyphenated with flame photometric detection (GC × GC-FPD; GC-FPD). The approach largely separated the sulfur compounds into two distinct regions comprising of lower polarity S 1 (thiophenes, thiophenols, thiols, disulfides, sulfides, and alkyl thianaphthenes) and higher polarity S 2 (sulfones and phenylsulfides) groups. The reliability of this approach was evaluated using higher resolution GC × GC-FPD, showing less than ± 1 % error arising from the coelution of minor compounds in GC-FPD analysis. The calibration method was further applied to reduce the error caused by the dependence of analyte contents on the sample dilution effect from ± 14 % to ± 4 %. The GC-FPD analysis showed {{a significant increase in}} S 2 content from 47 to 59 % after 113 min oxidation. This approach was then applied for characterization of 15 practical jet fuel samples from airforce bases...|$|E
