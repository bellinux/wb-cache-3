25|$|The castle {{was turned}} into a proto-Romanesque palace of stone in the 12th century (probably after 1179), <b>maybe</b> <b>because</b> King Béla III (1173–1196) decided to make Esztergom the {{definitive}} seat of kings of the Kingdom of Hungary. It was a palace similar to those constructed in Germany under Friedrich Barbarossa. In 1182 Friedrich Barbarossa gathered his crusader army under the castle. The church institutions and building at the castle were moved to the town below the castle in the early 12th century.|$|E
25|$|Its last refuge was {{dominated}} by endemic Guettarda insularis, Ilex socorroensis and Sideroxylon socorrense, as well as black cherry (Prunus serotina), Ficus cotinifolia fig trees and Psidium socorrense guavas, apparently all native on Socorro. At least {{at the time of}} the last record, it seemed to be dependent on intact understorey of Euphorbiaceae (spurges and relatives) and ferns, <b>maybe</b> <b>because</b> cats hunt less efficiently in these dense tangles. It is frugivorous and, as is often the case in Columbidae, might have played an important role in the reproduction of the trees which dominate its habitat. One of these (S. socorrense) is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN. In particular, it was found to associate with the fig trees.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to highlight the presence of Calabrians in Renaissance humanism and in the Renaissance. Indeed, the Hellenistics in this period frequently came from Calabria <b>maybe</b> <b>because</b> of the Greek influence. The rediscovery of Ancient Greek was very difficult because this language had been almost forgotten. In this period the presence of Calabrian humanists or refugees from Constantinople was fundamental. The study of Ancient Greek, in this period, was mainly a work of two monks of the monastery of Seminara: Barlaam, bishop of Gerace, and his disciple, Leonzio Pilato. Leonzio Pilato, in particular, was a Calabrian born near Reggio Calabria. He was an important teacher of Ancient Greek and translator, and he helped Giovanni Boccaccio in the translations of Homer's works.|$|E

25|$|Euripides' use of lyrics in the sung {{portion of}} his work shows the {{influence}} of Timotheus of Miletus in the later plays the individual singer gained prominence and was given additional scope to demonstrate his virtuosity in lyrical duets between actors, as well as replacing some of the chorus's functions with monodies. At the same time, choral odes begin to take on something of the form of dithyrambs reminiscent of the poetry of Bacchylides, featuring elaborate treatment of myths. Sometimes these later choral odes seem to have only a tenuous connection with the plot, linked to the action only in their mood. The Bacchae however shows a reversion to old forms, possibly as a deliberate archaic effect or <b>maybe</b> <b>because</b> there were no virtuoso choristers in Macedonia, where {{it is said to}} have been written.|$|E
25|$|Tsukuru stays {{alone with}} Kuro, now a {{successful}} pottery artist. Eri prefers {{to dispense with}} nicknames and explains that Yuzu was mentally ill. The rape accusation was a fabrication, but he was cut off {{as a way of}} not frontally contradicting Yuzu to enable her to deal with her problems. Eri reveals that {{she was in love with}} Tsukuru, which could have played a role in the accusation, but also that Yuzu was actually raped and had a miscarriage, then developed anorexia as a way of never being pregnant again. Eri told him nothing, <b>maybe</b> <b>because</b> he never noticed her love, but mostly to prevent a confrontation with Yuzu. Tsukuru was sacrificed to protect Yuzu because the group believed he was the strongest emotionally and could deal with the ban. These redemptive revelations give the lie to Tsukuru's own perception of himself as plain and colorless.|$|E
25|$|During Prima Vera's hiatus {{in early}} 1984, Falsk toured Norway with a solo {{stand-up}} comedy show. Prima Vera's shows {{had always had}} a certain element of toilet humor in their material, but for his solo act, Falsk got even dirtier. Falsk's solo act was described by some critics as vulgar and obscene, {{but in spite of}} this, or <b>maybe</b> <b>because</b> of it, the show was a big hit with the fans. The show was also recorded and released as an album, called Born in Drammen, which {{is believed to be the}} first ever stand-up comedy album released in Norway. The album title is a reference to Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA, which topped the charts in Norway at the time, and the album cover is an almost exact copy of the Born in the USA cover, except that Falsk is not wearing jeans or even underpants on the picture. After the Prima Vera breakup, Falsk did another comedy tour in 1985, and released a second comedy album called Falskboy, which also contained a few songs by Tom Mathisen.|$|E

The work was performed by Mike Patton and the Belgian Ictus Ensemble conducted by Georges-Elie Octors. Solos were performed by Ictus Ensemble clarinetist Dirk Descheemaeker, trumpeter Loïc Dumoulin, trombonist Michel Massot, double bass player Géry Cambier, and percussionists Michael Weilacher and Gerrit Nulens. Nederlands Kamerkoor provided the choral accompaniments. The album marks only the third recording of the composition to have been released since it was first broadcast on French radio by Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française. Patton has said of the work, [...] "I can listen to Berio and Nono as easily as I can to Morricone but like all modern music of Italy, it is unfortunately marginalized... <b>Maybe</b> <b>because</b> of the language barrier, <b>maybe</b> <b>because</b> it’s not easily understood. Berio, who was teaching in California when he wrote this piece, was listening to jazz, pop and folk music and incorporated all of it in his works without prejudice." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} the eighth most-watched {{program of the}} week along with NBC's Sunday Night Football, with 11.4 million viewers, it {{received}} a 17 share in the ratings. Overall, the episode was well received by critics. Nina Hämmerling Smith of TV Guide quoted: [...] "Perhaps {{the best thing about}} the episode was the amount of screen time given to old favorites like Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) and Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). The show's most convincing writing has always been in the scenes when those two spar with House, and I was thrilled to see more of that". Most critics were surprised and interested by the performance of Chris Taub in this episode. Richard Keller of TV Squad, wrote that he was almost certain of the fact that Taub was going to be fired and he was glad that he wasn't. He also quoted, [...] "For some reason I like Taub. <b>Maybe</b> <b>because</b> he's not pretty like the rest of them. He's just an everyday schlub who's a pretty decent doctor".|$|E
500|$|Throughout the season, O'Ree faced blatant racism from opponents, {{remarking}} [...] "people {{just wanted}} a piece of me, <b>maybe</b> <b>because</b> they thought I was different, so I had to defend myself. [...] I wasn't going to be run out of any rink." [...] He endured racial slurs from fans in each of Chicago, Detroit and New York, though the taunts were largely absent in Montreal and Toronto. [...] O'Ree was supported by his teammates and Boston fans. He stated [...] "they were mean to me in places like Detroit and New York, too. [...] But never in Boston. [...] I'll never forget how my teammates there took care of me — men like Johnny Bucyk, Doug Mohns, Charlie Burns and Don McKenney. [...] They accepted me totally. [...] All of them had class." [...] In 1961, O'Ree was traded to Montreal {{but was unable to}} crack the Canadiens' line-up. [...] Playing over 20 minor league seasons, O'Ree twice won the Western Hockey League's scoring title: in 1964, with the Los Angeles Blades, and in 1969, with the San Diego Gulls.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Christine Fenno {{believed}} the episode had [...] "false starts" [...] but still [...] "enjoyed the trippy places the writers took us." [...] While disliking the initial scenes with Charlie and Locke, Fenno thought the episode [...] "found its groove" [...] after Locke {{entered into the}} trance, and called the final scene between Eddie and Locke the episode's [...] "strongest moment." [...] The Record gave a negative review, noting that [...] "Unfortunately, 'Instructions' seemed devoid of everything that made 'The Glass Ballerina' hum. It was disjointed, it was graceless, and it seemed filled with gaping holes and not terribly helpful information." [...] In a 2008 review, Ryan McGee of Zap2It gave the episode another negative review and considered it the weakest of the season's first three episodes. He explained that after watching {{it for a second}} time, it [...] "just feels off to me in hindsight.

"I'm with You" [...] The adult ballad hit {{record stores}} in late November 2002, close to Christmas {{holidays}} to remind {{parents about the}} album to, if not to buy it themselves, to purchase it for any children in their family. The song ended up being another hit for Lavigne reaching No. 4 in the Billboard Hot 100, No. 1 in mainstream radio and top 10 in the UK and Canada. It was not officially released in Australia but received radio and television airplay, this song was also nominated for two Grammy Awards the same categories as [...] "Complicated". The release arrangement of the album's singles, with [...] "I'm With You" [...] being served as the third, was regarded as [...] "controversial", given that [...] "I'm With You" [...] was [...] "thought {{by some to be}} the biggest potential smash on the album", and could have established Lavigne as a more mature artist if it was released first.

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the tracks on She Wolf, {{according}} to Shakira, have been written from a [...] "very feminine perspective". She attributed this to her growing maturity, noting [...] "I think <b>maybe</b> <b>because</b> I feel more like a woman today". Many of the songs focus on [...] "emotions that a woman experiments when you're in love or out of love— jealousy, fantasies, daydreams", which the singer said were based on her conversations with girlfriends who are [...] "struggling with their own romantic lives". This issue is prominently covered in the track [...] "Men in This Town", in which Shakira sings {{about the lack of}} eligible bachelors in Los Angeles. The song contains references to American actors Angelina Jolie and Matt Damon, the latter of whom Shakira knows personally, and popular destinations like the SkyBar. [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV commented that [...] "Shakira wasn't afraid to get a little wacky {{when it came to the}} lyrics on She Wolf". In an interview with Jim Cantiello, the singer was asked for the reason behind lyrics like [...] "I'm so happy I should get sued" [...] (in the track [...] "Long Time"), to which Shakira replied [...] "Maybe it rhymed. It's hard to explain your own lyrics, you know". In [...] "Mon Amour", she wishes that her ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend have a terrible vacation in Paris and are eaten alive by [...] "French fleas". Other themes the album touches upon include night-life, sex, and seduction, in songs like [...] "Did It Again" [...] and [...] "Spy". Rolling Stone critic Jody Rosen labelled the latter [...] "a meditation on masturbation".|$|E

Club's Rowan Kaiser noted the apparent lack of guest stars in the episode, adding, [...] "I can't help but feel [...] {{is a good thing}} in for Family Guy." [...] In the conclusion of his review Kaiser praised the [...] "shock humor" [...] in the limousine jousting scene, but compared Carter's catchphrases to [...] "the kind of groan-inducing meta-humor that [...] The Cleveland Show aims for." [...] He ultimately gave the episode a C rating, the second best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode [...] "How Cleveland Got His Groove Back" [...] and tying with the American Dad! episode [...] "Son of Stan". In a slightly more neutral review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's cutaways, stating that they [...] "came back with a vengeance this week." [...] Hughes went on to comment negatively on the scene involving Carter being woken up and hinting at incest with his daughter, noting, [...] "It's weird that while the pedophile character of Herbert doesn't bother me at all, this potential admission really does. <b>Maybe</b> <b>because</b> it adds an element of incest, or seemed more genuine than Herbert's over-the-top antics. But really, it's just another throwaway gag in the world of Seth MacFarlane." [...] Actor Jonathan Lipnicki, who was parodied in the episode, responded to his portrayal by stating, [...] "I don't feel bad about what they said on Family Guy. It was all in good fun, I've worked on that show [...]" ...|$|E

40|$|Hardly a {{day goes}} by that the threats to our {{environment}} are not brought to our attention. Whether you are following oil spills, groundwater contamination, global warming, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) or volatile organic compounds (VOCs), you must admit: environmental issues get an awful lot more attention than basic energy technology. <b>Maybe</b> it's <b>because</b> we associate more personal risk with our groundwater or air being polluted (e. g., Love Canal). <b>Maybe</b> it's <b>because</b> we have a large group of professionals (environmentalists) who get easy access to the media. Or <b>maybe</b> its <b>because</b> the energy technology business doesn't have the watchdog agency equivalent of the EPA. But for all these and more, environmental issues tend to be the major drivers of change. The analysis developed in this paper illustrates how the coming decades of increasing environmental pressure can have a great impact on energy options. If we use this time as an opportunity to use technology wisely, we will all be better for it. However, there are signs that just the opposite is actually happening. In fact, the issue of global warming is once again being used to mount a massive campaign to promote cogeneration. This paper takes a closer look at that. Similarly, the CFC issue could grow into another asbestos abatement fiasco that literally tears away the diversity in available cooling options. And all too many industrial firms out there are still coating metals or films with VOCs. They must change. We will demonstrate how technology once again comes into play. Thus, whenever you see an environmental problem, consider it an energy challenge...|$|R
