5|$|Organometallic {{chemistry}} of vanadium is well developed, {{although it has}} mainly only academic significance. Vanadocene dichloride is a versatile starting reagent and even finds some applications in organic chemistry. Vanadium carbonyl, V(CO)6, is a rare example of a paramagnetic <b>metal</b> <b>carbonyl.</b> Reduction yields V (isoelectronic with Cr(CO)6), which may be further reduced with sodium in liquid ammonia to yield V (isoelectronic with Fe(CO)5).|$|E
25|$|Analogous to the silanes, halopolysilanes SinX2n+2 {{are also}} known. While {{catenation}} in carbon compounds is maximised in the hydrogen compounds {{rather than the}} halides, {{the opposite is true}} for silicon, so that the halopolysilanes are known up to at least Si14F30, Si6Cl14, and Si4Br10. A suggested explanation for this phenomenon is the compensation for the electron loss of silicon to the more electronegative halogen atoms by pi backbonding from the filled pπ orbitals on the halogen atoms to the empty dπ orbitals on silicon: this is similar to the situation of carbon monoxide in <b>metal</b> <b>carbonyl</b> complexes and explains their stability. These halopolysilanes may be produced by comproportionation of silicon tetrahalides with elemental silicon, or by condensation of lighter halopolysilanes (trimethylammonium being a useful catalyst for this reaction).|$|E

500|$|The {{most common}} {{oxidation}} state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4, while +2 {{is found in}} carbon monoxide and transition <b>metal</b> <b>carbonyl</b> complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones, dolomites and carbon dioxide, but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal, peat, oil, and methane clathrates. Carbon forms {{a vast number of}} compounds, more than any other element, with almost ten million compounds described to date, and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions. For this reason, carbon has often been referred to as the [...] "king of the elements".|$|E
