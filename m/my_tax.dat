2500|$|During {{the inquiry}} he {{repeatedly}} berated the politicians conducting it, and the government. When {{asked about his}} company's tax minimisation schemes, he replied: [...] "Of course I am minimising <b>my</b> <b>tax.</b> And if anybody in this country doesn't minimise their tax, they want their heads read, because as a government, I can tell you you're not spending it that well {{that we should be}} donating extra!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul was {{questioned}} on Meet the Press by Tim Russert for asking that US$400 million in previously earmarked funds be directed {{back to his}} district for water projects, a nursing program, to expand a hospital cancer center and US$10 million to promote Texas shrimp. On Meet the Press, Paul defended his bid for the earmarked funds saying he never voted for an earmark in his life. Russert said Paul's statement was like saying, [...] "you voted for it before you voted against it." [...] Congressman Paul responded,"I put them in because I represent people who are asking for some of their money back, ... I'm against the tax system, but I take all <b>my</b> <b>tax</b> credits.

2500|$|On December 16, 2015, Buffett {{endorsed}} Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for president. On August 1, 2016, Buffett challenged Donald Trump {{to release}} his tax returns. On October 10, 2016, after another reference {{to him in}} the 2nd 2016 presidential debate, Buffett released his own tax return. He said he had paid $1.85 million in federal income taxes in 2015 on an adjusted gross income of $11.6 million, meaning he had an effective federal income tax rate of around 16 percent. [...] Buffett also said he had made more than $2.8 billion worth of donations last year. Buffett said, [...] "I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited. I have no problem in releasing <b>my</b> <b>tax</b> information while under audit. Neither would Mr. Trump -- at least he would have no legal problem." [...] This was a measured response to Trump saying he was unable to release his tax information due to being under audit.|$|E

I said, just now, that, for {{the sake}} of students, <b>my</b> <b>tax</b> should not be laid on black or on white pigments; but if you mean to be a colorist, you must lay a tax on them yourself when you begin to use true color; that is to say, you must use them little, and make of them much. There is no better test of your color tones being good, than your having made the white in your picture precious, and the black conspicuous.|$|E

"Why," [...] says he, [...] "I've been tugging {{ever since}} harvest, getting out wheat and hauling {{it to the}} river to raise State Bank paper enough to pay <b>my</b> <b>tax</b> this year and a little school debt I owe; and now, just as I 've got it, here I open this infernal Extra Register, expecting to find it full of 'Glorious Democratic Victories' and 'High Comb'd Cocks,' when, lo and behold! I find a set of fellows, calling {{themselves}} officers of the State, have forbidden the tax collectors, and school commissioners to receive State paper at all; and so here it is dead on my hands. I don't now believe all the plunder I've got will fetch ready cash enough to pay my taxes and that school debt." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2012, {{while at}} the World Economic Forum in Ethiopia, Times' {{journalist}} Lucy Bannerman asked Geldof how much taxes he paid, since Geldof had suggested that aid to developing nations could be increased through higher taxes.

5000|$|I {{actually}} {{take the money}} that the IRS says goes to them and I {{give it to the}} places where our taxes should be going.

60|$|I {{have paid}} no poll tax for six years. I {{was put into}} a jail once on this account, for one night; and, as I stood {{considering}} the walls of solid stone, two or three feet thick, the door of wood and iron, a foot thick, and the iron grating which strained the light, I could not help being struck with the foolishness of that institution which treated me as if I were mere flesh and blood and bones, to be locked up. I wondered {{that it should have}} concluded at length that this was the best use it could put me to, and had never thought to avail itself of my services in some way. I saw that, if there was a wall of stone between me and my townsmen, there was a still more difficult one to climb or break through before they could get to be as free as I was. I did not for a moment feel confined, and the walls seemed a great waste of stone and mortar. I felt as if I alone of all my townsmen had paid <b>my</b> <b>tax.</b> They plainly {{did not know how to}} treat me, but behaved like persons who are underbred. In every threat and in every compliment there was a blunder; for they thought that my chief desire was to stand the other side of that stone wall. I could not but smile to see how industriously they locked the door on my meditations, which followed them out again without let or hindrance, and they were really all that was dangerous. As they could not reach me, they had resolved to punish my body; just as boys, if they cannot come at some person against whom they have a spite, will abuse his dog. I saw that the State was half-witted, that it was timid as a lone woman with her silver spoons, and that it did not know its friends from its foes, and I lost all my remaining respect for it, and pitied it.|$|E

50|$|Stein {{has criticized}} the United States Internal Revenue Code {{for being too}} lenient on the wealthy. He has {{repeated}} the observation made by Warren Buffett, {{one of the richest}} individuals in the world (who pays mostly capital gains tax), that Buffett pays a lower overall tax rate than his secretaries (who pay income taxes and payroll taxes). Stein has advocated increasing taxation on the wealthy. Stein objected to Obama's proposal in 2010 to not extend tax cuts for the highest earning taxpayers {{in the midst of the}} recession, saying that There is no known economic theory under which raising <b>my</b> <b>taxes</b> in the midst of a severe recession will help the economy recover. It isn't part of any well known monetarist or Keynesian theory. So if it does no good to raise our taxes, I assume we are being punished. But for what? I don't own slaves. I employ a lot of people full- and part-time and they are all happy with their pay. When charity calls, I almost always write out a check...Maybe when the economy recovers, raising <b>my</b> <b>taxes</b> makes sense, but for now, it's just punishment. In 2012, Stein stated that due to the tremendous amount of national debt, he agreed with Obama's proposal to increase taxes on the wealthy and that ultimately everyone's taxes should be raised to avoid defaulting on the debt.|$|R
