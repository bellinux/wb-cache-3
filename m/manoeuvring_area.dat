TMA airspace is normally designed in a circular configuration centered on the geographic coordinates of the airport, and differs from a control area in that it includes several levels of increasingly larger areas, creating an [...] "upside-down wedding cake" [...] shape.|$|E

50|$|In 1945, {{during the}} final phase of the war, newly {{developed}} subsonic jet planes like the first jet-powered bomber Arado 234 were stationed at the airfield and the runway was extended by several hundred metres. At that time, many Ju 88 bombers were 'parked' at Reinsehlen, probably {{due to a lack of}} fuel and pilots. Isolated strafing attacks aside, the airfield was never attacked or bombed on a large scale, although it was known to British air recon. On 7 April 1945, a US bomber fleet numbering over 1,000 planes entered German airspace to destroy the remaining military targets before the advance of American ground troops. The airfield at Reinsehlen was on the target list, but due to cloud cover the bombers were unable to find it. As a last-ditch attempt to stop the advancing Allies, an anti-tank ditch was begun and farmers from the area were ordered to plow deep furrows into the airfield's <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>area</b> to make it unusable. However, once British troops arrived, there was no resistance due to a lack of weapons and personnel. The Germans handed over the airfield to the British without a fight on 17 April 1945. A few hours before, German soldiers had burned the remaining planes. Damage to the airfield was quickly repaired by the British. It became known as Advanced Landing Ground B-154 Reinsehlen and before the war ended on 8 May (VE Day), Royal Canadian Air Force planes operated from Reinsehlen, including Spitfires of 127 (RCAF) Wing, No 403 (Wolf) Sqn that came to Reinsehlen on 28 April.|$|E

The guidelines for system design, needed for cost/benefit analysis, were described in a previous EuRAD paper [1]. As in many other radar applications, pulse compression is a key element to achieve the required MPAR performances with low-cost solutions using relatively low-peak-power Transmit/Receive modules.

50|$|A refined version are gun <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>areas</b> {{developed}} by UK {{for use by}} AS90 batteries when the counter-battery threat is high. These areas cover several square kilometres and the guns move around in them in pairs. The difficult decision is deciding how long guns can remain in one place before moving. This requires judgement about the enemy's counter-battery responsiveness. In these areas, the battery's command elements remain {{in one place and}} there are various options for replenishing the guns' on-board ammunition. The tactic is affected by the rate of fire of the manoeuvring guns and the time it takes them to come out of action. However, it is also very wearing on the gun crews and for sustained use relief crews are essential.|$|R

An integrated target/weather surveillance at medium range, i. e. for Terminal <b>Manoeuvre</b> <b>Area</b> {{in the frame}} of ATC and regional weather monitoring, is made possible by MPAR (Multifunction Phased Array Radar) techniques, allowing a single technology to satisfy different requirements.

The key techniques needed to achieve the required performance are (a) interleaving of functions by careful scheduling, (b) digital beam forming for target surveillance and (c) fast (electronic) scanning for the weather surveillance. Using these techniques it is possible to design an architecture in which the Transmit/Receive module (TRM) may operate with a rated low peak power, compatible with the low-cost requirement...|$|R

The radar tracks are modelled with different types of segments, straight lines, cubic spline function and shape preserving cubic function. The longitudinal, lateral and vertical deviations are calculated for terminal <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>area</b> scenarios. The most promising model of the radar tracks resulted from a mixed interpolation using straight lines for linear segments and spline cubic functions for curved segments.

The department of Flight Guidance unitizes the arrival manager during the last few months. For the internal project FAGI (Future Air Ground Integration) they need a new module to assign entry-fixes to all aircraft. The entry-fixes are the points which the aircraft must pass if they want to fly into the Extended Terminal <b>Manoeuvring</b> <b>Area</b> (ETMA). In the first version we imple-mented a round robin algorithm to assign these entry-fixes. To avoid conflicts between two aircraft on the same entry-fix the intelligence of the module had to be increased.

40|$|International audienceThe {{delegation}} to the flight crew of some tasks currently performed by air traffic controllers provides new perspectives to potentially increase air traffic control efficiency. More specifically, the task of establishing properly spaced landing sequences is very demanding in heavy traffic conditions for the air traffic controllers {{in charge of the}} terminal <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>area.</b> Automatic merging and station keeping operations could relieve air traffic controller of providing time consuming radar vectoring instructions. The objective of this communication is to provide technical insight into the airborne devices and algorithms which may be used onboard aircraft to automatically achieve a specified distance or delay with respect to another aircraft at a specified meter fix. A nonlinear control law based on sliding mode control is proposed to control the lateral motion of the trailing aircraft. The design is followed by two illustrative examples which show the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|E

In two patients the heart rates were fixed and greater than 100 /min and in three there was postural hypotension. The baroflex sensitivity of four patients was abnormal and heart rate response to Valsalva's manoeuvre was impaired {{in two of the}} three patients who were able to perform the <b>manoeuvre.</b> <b>Areas</b> of anhidrosis were found in all seven patients.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} is {{presented}} a methodology that uses simulation together with optimization techniques for a conflict detection and resolution at airports.

Both the airport airspace (terminal <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>area),</b> and airside (runway taxiways and terminals), were modelled. In this framework, different restrictions such as speed, separation minima between aircraft, and capacity of airside components were taken into account. The airspace was modeled as a network of links and nodes representing the different routes, while the airside was modeled in a low detail, where runway, taxiways and terminals were modeled as servers with a specific capacity.

40|$|Abstract — A new {{approach}} is proposed to the surveillance of Security and Safety occurrences concerning mobile objects {{in an airport}} environment, in particular to monitor aircrafts, vehicles and staff at the <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>area</b> for all weather conditions. A middleware platform receives localization infor-mation from the different mobile objects in the airport and merges that information through data fusion in the platform. The system outputs are shown in a high-resolution Graphical-User interface, providing a collaborative environment with the relevant information to the airport stakeholders. The outputs {{can be used by}} the stakeholders to take decisions on the best way to improve security and safety and also on the optimiza-tion of airport operational procedures in compliance with ex-isting business rules. In this paper, the proposed system archi-tecture follows an event-driven approach based on streams of occurrences processed in real-time. Therefore, it is suited for decision support. We will illustrate our approach by monitor-ing events occurred in an airport environment.
