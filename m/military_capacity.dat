5|$|According to the Hittite inscriptions, {{it appears}} that the Ahhiya were a {{powerful}} empire, at the same scale as contemporary Egypt, Assyria and the Hittite Empire. Moreover, {{based on the fact that}} Attarsiya launched a military campaign in Anatolia and fielded one hundred chariots, in addition to infantry, Dutch researcher Jorrit Kelder suggested that Ahhiya must have had the <b>military</b> <b>capacity</b> of at least three times the size of the Mycenaean kingdom of Pylos, based on the information recorded on the Linear B tablets unearthed from the specific palace. Based on this view, the Achaeans under Attarsiya may have formed some kind of alliance which included several Mycenaean kingdoms.|$|E

Charles and Leszczyński were supported by the Warsaw Confederation of Polish nobles. In opposition to these developments the Sandomierz Confederation was created by other nobles in support of Augustus. The latter could call on about 75% of the <b>military</b> <b>capacity</b> of the Polish army. Some smaller engagements at Poznań, Lwów, Warsaw and Poniec followed in 1704 as a consequence of Augustus' attempts to retake the throne.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We explore {{theoretical}} {{foundations and}} {{issues in the}} em-pirical estimation of conflict technologies. Such technologies are probabilistic choice functions that depend on the <b>military</b> <b>capacities</b> of adversaries, where the <b>military</b> <b>capacities</b> themselves depend on economic inputs via ordinary production functions. Different classes of functional forms can be derived stochastically or axiomatically. The additive form, in particular, (which in-cludes both the logit and ratio functional forms) has both stochastic and axiomatic foundations. Issues in the empirical estimation that we explore include concerns with data, endogeneity, structural breaks, and model com-parison. 1...|$|R

5|$|While East Timor's {{decision}} {{to form a}} military has been criticised by some commentators, the East Timorese government has consistently believed that the force is necessary for political and security reasons. Critics of the F-FDTL's establishment argue that as East Timor does not face any external threats the government's limited resources would be better spent on strengthening the PNTL. While East Timor's political leadership recognises that the country does not currently face an external threat, they {{believe that it is}} necessary to maintain a <b>military</b> <b>capacity</b> to deter future aggression. The establishment of the F-FDTL was also seen as an effective means of integrating FALINTIL into an independent East Timor.|$|E

25|$|Even Hyun Jin Kim, who {{argues for}} a Hunnish victory, {{thinks that the}} battle had a major outcome {{on the future of}} Roman Gaul. First, he debunks the claims that it was a {{religious}} and cultural victory over the Huns of Central Asia. Kim argues that the battle significantly weakened the <b>military</b> <b>capacity</b> of the Alans, Visigoths, and the Romans, which allowed for Frankish and Burgundian hegemony in North Gaul. He also believes that it set up the career of Odoacer, who would later found his own Kingdom in Italy after deposing the last Western Roman Emperor and submitting to Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|The lack {{of trained}} {{military}} {{was one of}} the most pressing difficulties of the revolutionary government in Buenos Aires. Besides the Patricios Regiment and other corps formed during the British invasions, the only troops with some experience were the Blandengues, lancers militia recruited to patrol the borders of the territories still controlled by indigenous people (mapuche and ranquel). Until 1812, with the arrival of veterans from the Napoleonic Wars, that would join as officers, the army was basically a militia. Most of the commanders were civilians or junior officers, put in charge more for their political leanings, status in society or charisma than for their <b>military</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E

25|$|Between 27 June and 20 July 1921, a {{reinforced}} Greek army of nine divisions {{launched a}} major offensive, the greatest thus far, against the Turkish troops commanded by Ismet Inönü {{on the line}} of Afyonkarahisar-Kütahya-Eskişehir. The plan of the Greeks was to cut Anatolia in two, as the above towns were on the main rail-lines connecting the hinterland with the coast. Eventually, after breaking the stiff Turkish defences, they occupied these strategically important centres. Instead of pursuing and decisively crippling the nationalists' <b>military</b> <b>capacity,</b> the Greek Army halted. In consequence, and despite their defeat, the Turks managed to avoid encirclement and made a strategic retreat on {{the east of the}} Sakarya River, where they organised their last line of defence.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains (or Fields), {{also called}} the Battle of the Campus Mauriacus, Battle of Châlons or the Battle of Maurica, took place on June 20, 451 AD, between a {{coalition}} led by the Roman general Flavius Aetius and the Visigothic king Theodoric I against the Huns and their vassals commanded by their king Attila. It {{was one of the}} last major military operations of the Western Roman Empire, although Germanic foederati composed the majority of the coalition army. Whether the battle was strategically conclusive is disputed: The Romans stopped the Huns' attempt to establish vassals in Roman Gaul, and installed Merovech as king of the Franks. However, the Huns successfully looted and pillaged much of Gaul and crippled the <b>military</b> <b>capacity</b> of the Romans and Visigoths. The Hunnic Empire was later dismantled by a coalition of their Germanic vassals at the Battle of Nedao in 454.|$|E
25|$|ABDA {{was charged}} with holding the Malay Barrier {{for as long as}} {{possible}} in order to retain Allied control of the Indian Ocean and the western sea approaches to Australia. This was a nearly hopeless task, given the Japanese supremacy in naval forces in the western Pacific. The task was further complicated by the addition of Burma to the command; the difficulties of coordinating action between forces of four nationalities that used different equipment and had not trained together; and the different priorities of the national governments. British leaders were primarily interested in retaining control of Singapore; the <b>military</b> <b>capacity</b> of the Dutch East Indies had suffered as a result of the defeat of the Netherlands in 1940, and the Dutch administration was focused on defending the island of Java; the Australian government was heavily committed to the war in North Africa and Europe, and had few readily accessible military resources, and; the United States was preoccupied with the Philippines, which at the time was a U.S. Commonwealth territory.|$|E

25|$|The {{immediate}} and {{long-term effects of}} the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields are somewhat disputed. Attila returned to invade the Western Roman Empire in 452, which was more successful than his invasion of Gaul. After a 3-month siege of Aquileia, arranged by Aetius in the hopes it would use up his whole campaigning season, Attila razed the city and ravaged the Po Valley. Aetius, without aid from the federates in Gaul and without the <b>military</b> <b>capacity</b> to stop Attila on his own, sent an embassy consisting of Pope Leo I, Trygetius, and Gennadius Aviennus to broker a treaty with Attila. Attila ultimately retreated from Italy due to the local famine and disease within his army. Some authors have argued that this sequence of military fiascos for Aetius ultimately led to his downfall. Merrils and Miles also argue {{it led to the}} downfall of Valentinian III as a result of Aetius' assassination. This has been disputed recently by Meghan McEvoy, who argues that Valentinian III wanted to partake the role of an active emperor and simply needed to remove his manager, {{and that there was no}} real direct cause for Aetius' murder.|$|E
25|$|A {{sense of}} the size of the actual Roman army may be found in the study of the Notitia Dignitatum by A.H.M. Jones. This {{document}} is a list of officials and military units that was last updated in the first decades of the 5th century. The Notitia Dignitatum lists 58 various regular units, and 33 limitanei serving either in the Gallic provinces or on the frontiers nearby; the total of these units, based on Jones analysis, is 34,000 for the regular units and 11,500 for the limitanei, or just under 46,000 all told. However, this figure is an estimate for the years 395–425 and one that constantly changes with new research. The loss of Africa resulted in the loss of funding for 40,000 infantry and 20,000 cavalry in the Roman army, in addition to previous losses, which was enough to permanently cripple Roman <b>military</b> <b>capacity</b> after 439 AD. According to Herwig Wolfram, with an annual revenue of 40,000 pounds of gold in 450 AD, the Western Empire would have had to spend almost two thirds of its income to maintain an army of 30,000 men.|$|E
25|$|As the FARC {{rejected}} Uribe's new policies, {{the government}} unleashed a large-scale military, political and judicial offensive against the guerrillas, {{resulting in a}} drastic reduction of their <b>military</b> <b>capacity,</b> albeit {{at the cost of}} grave human rights violations by the armed forces ("false positives"). The State's offensive forced the FARC to retreat to their hinterland, and achieved significant results such as securing the country's main roadways, a {{reduction in the number of}} kidnappings, a substantial drop in the homicide rate and the recovery of government authority in several regions of the country. Taken on the whole, these well-publicized results made Uribe extremely popular and granted him sufficient political capital to successfully seek congressional approval of a constitutional amendment allowing him to run for a second consecutive term in 2006. However, while the army and the police's operations recovered control of regions where the guerrillas had expanded their influence during the 1980s and 1990s, the FARC displayed a capacity to re-accommodate and reactivate themselves militarily in new strategic hinterland and border regions. The FARC showed their military resilience through terrorist attacks in urban environments (El Nogal Club bombing in 2003) and a counteroffensive in 2005.|$|E

25|$|Mussolini {{had sought}} to delay a major war in Europe until at least 1942, but Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. This {{resulted}} in declarations of war by France and the UK {{and the start of}} World War II. On 10 June 1940—with the Fall of France imminent—Italy officially entered the war on the side of Germany, though he was aware that Italy did not have the <b>military</b> <b>capacity</b> and resources to carry out a long war with the British Empire. Mussolini believed that after the imminent French armistice, Italy could gain territorial concessions from France and then he could concentrate his forces on a major offensive in North Africa, where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces. However, the UK government refused to accept proposals for a peace that would involve accepting Axis victories in Eastern and Western Europe, plans for an invasion of the UK did not proceed and the war continued. In the summer of 1941, Mussolini sent Italian forces to participate in the invasion of the Soviet Union and war with the United States followed in December.|$|E
25|$|The CEH {{stated that}} {{at no time}} during the {{internal}} armed confrontation did the guerrilla groups have the military potential necessary to pose an imminent threat to the State. The number of insurgent combatants {{was too small to}} be able to compete in the military arena with the Army, which had more troops and superior weaponry, as well as better training and co-ordination. The State and the Army were well aware that the insurgents’ <b>military</b> <b>capacity</b> did not represent a real threat to Guatemala's political order. The CEH concludes that the State deliberately magnified the military threat of the insurgency, a practice justified by the concept of the internal enemy. The inclusion of all opponents under one banner, democratic or otherwise, pacifist or guerrilla, legal or illegal, communist or non-communist, served to justify numerous and serious crimes. Faced with widespread political, socio-economic and cultural opposition, the State resorted to military operations directed towards the physical annihilation or absolute intimidation of this opposition, through a plan of repression carried out mainly by the Army and national security forces. On this basis the CEH explains why {{the vast majority of the}} victims of the acts committed by the State were not combatants in guerrilla groups, but civilians.|$|E
25|$|The {{invasion}} of Poland by Germany was deemed unacceptable by Britain, France and their allies, resulting in their mutual {{declaration of war}} against Germany that was deemed the aggressor {{in the war in}} Poland, resulting in the outbreak of World War II. In 1940, Mussolini led Italy into World War II {{on the side of the}} Axis. Mussolini was aware that Italy did not have the <b>military</b> <b>capacity</b> to carry out a long war with France or the United Kingdom and waited until France was on the verge of imminent collapse and surrender from the German invasion before declaring war on France and the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940 on the assumption that the war would be short-lived following France's collapse. Mussolini believed that following a brief entry of Italy into war with France, followed by the imminent French surrender, Italy could gain some territorial concessions from France and then concentrate its forces on a major offensive in Egypt where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces. Plans by Germany to invade the United Kingdom in 1940 failed after Germany lost the aerial warfare campaign in the Battle of Britain. In 1941, the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa. Axis forces at the height of their power controlled almost all of continental Europe. The war became prolonged—contrary to Mussolini's plans—resulting in Italy losing battles on multiple fronts and requiring German assistance.|$|E
