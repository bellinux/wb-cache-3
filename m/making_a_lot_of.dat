5|$|After {{the first}} game's {{development}} was finished, Mikami told Takumi {{that they should}} make an Ace Attorney trilogy, with a grand finale in the third game's last case. Takumi had originally planned to let Edgeworth be the prosecutor in all episodes in the second game, but during the production the development team learned that the character had become popular. This led to Takumi feeling {{that he had to}} use the character more carefully and sparingly; he created the new prosecutor character Franziska von Karma, to save Edgeworth for the game's last case, and avoid a situation where he – a supposed prodigy – loses every case. As Takumi wanted the three first Ace Attorney games to be parts of a larger work, he avoided <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> changes between games: art from the first game for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth was reused, to avoid having the previous games look outdated in comparison to newer games in the series; and no new gameplay mechanics were added for Trials and Tribulations, as Takumi was happy with the gameplay after having added the psyche-lock mechanic for Justice for All.|$|E

The South Africans had been due to tour England in 1970, but the tour was called off, and though other players, such as Barry Richards and Mike Procter returned to their English counties for the season, Irvine did {{not go back to}} Essex.

25|$|It {{was both}} {{necessity}} {{and the prospect}} of <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> money that gave birth to the steam-powered grain elevator in Buffalo, New York, in 1843. Due to the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, Buffalo enjoyed a unique position in American geography. It stood at the intersection of two great all-water routes: one extending from New York Harbor, up the Hudson River, to Albany and, beyond it, the Port of Buffalo; the other constituted by the Great Lakes, which could theoretically take boaters in any direction they wished to go (north to Canada, west to Michigan or Wisconsin, south to Toledo and Cleveland, or east to the Atlantic Ocean). All through the 1830s, Buffalo benefited tremendously from its position. In particular, it was the recipient of most of the increasing quantities of grain (mostly wheat) that was being grown on farms in Ohio and Indiana, and shipped on Lake Erie for transshipment to the Erie Canal. If Buffalo hadn't been there, or when things got backed up there, that grain would have been loaded onto boats at Cincinnati and shipped down the Mississippi River to New Orleans.|$|E
25|$|Result: Odyssey {{decided on}} a 1940s theme at a premium price, while Platinum went with a theme based around Alice in Wonderland and the Mad Hatter's tea party, and much cheaper pricing. Things {{generally}} went smoothly on Odyssey, {{though there was a}} major argument between Alice and Maria over the pricing, as Alice wanted to offer discounts for senior citizens, while Maria felt everyone should pay full price. They struggled to attract customers as the day went on, and had to resort to slashing prices as the task drew to a close. Despite the price cutting, it only managed to pull in 2 extra customers. On Platinum, David had trouble effectively leading the team, which resulted in Ashleigh <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the decisions: on the second day, their tea service rapidly descended into chaos, with David still struggling to lead the team, and customers failing to be served in a timely manner. However, the service smoothed out as the day progressed and they took over £100 more than Odyssey. Despite their better overall execution of the task, Odyssey spent £100 more money, which proved decisive in the end figures. Odyssey had a profit of £91, and Platinum had a profit of £316, more than 3 times the amount of Odyssey.|$|E
