The nobility in the Commonwealth was officially equal, and used different and non-hereditary titles than those found in {{rest of the world}} (see officials of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth); the gist of the conflict, which took much of the Sejm's time around 1638–41, revolved around whether old prince titles (awarded to families before their lands were incorporated into the Commonwealth in the 1569 Union of Lublin), and the new titles, awarded more recently by some foreign courts, should be recognized. Wiśniowiecki was one of the chief participants in this debate, successfully defending the old titles, including that of his own family, and succeeding in abolishing the new titles, which gained him the enmity of another powerful magnate, Jerzy Ossoliński.

40|$|Freeze-dried cryo-sections {{of barley}} roots (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Alexis) {{were used to}} {{investigate}} the possible role of the root apoplast as an iron-storage pool for plants; this possibility has {{been a matter of}} controversy. Micro-PIXE analyzes in pixel mode were complemented by the STIM technique. Data were analyzed using the new Heidelberg software package BIOPIXE, which provides true elemental maps of inhomogeneous samples such as freeze-dried cross-sections of roots. The maps clearly show a high heterogeneity of the iron distribution in roots between adjacent cell layers. Accumulations of iron were observed in the cell walls of the outermost cell layers of the roots and at the endodermis. Based on the correlation between iron and soil related elements like titanium, aluminum and silicon, most of the iron located at the root surface could be attributed to soil contamination. It could also be shown that these soil contaminations lead to an overestimation of the apoplastic iron concentrations determined by methods commonly used in the botanical field. Besides this, low accumulations of iron were observed in the cell walls of the outmost cell layers of the roots. This may indicate that the root apoplast may have a <b>minor</b> <b>function</b> in iron nutrition. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E
40|$|The gram-positive {{eubacterium}} Bacillus subtilis is {{the organism}} {{with the largest}} number of paralogous type I signal peptidases (SPases) known, These are specified both by chromosomal and plasmid-borne genes. The chromosomally encoded SPases SipS and SipT have a major function in precursor processing, and cells depleted of SipS and SipT stop growing and die. In this study, we show that the SPase SipP, specified by the B. subtilis plasmid pTA 1015, can functionally replace SipS and SipT, unlike the three chromosomally encoded SPases with a <b>minor</b> <b>function</b> in protein secretion (i. e., SipU, SipV, and SipW). Unexpectedly, SipP is not specifically required for the processing and secretion of Orf 1 p, which is specified by a gene that is cotranscribed with sipP. These two genes form a conserved structural module of rolling-circle plasmids from B. subtilis, As previously shown for the chromosomal sipS and sipT genes, the transcription of plasmid-borne copies of sipP is temporally controlled, reaching maximal levels during the post-exponential growth phase when the cells secrete proteins at high levels. However, increased transcription of sipP starts at the end of exponential growth, about 2 h earlier than that of sipS and sipT. These data suggest that SipP fulfills a general role in the secretory precursor processing of pTA 1015 -containing cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) system ensures genome integrity by removing mispaired and unpaired bases that originate during replication. A {{major source of}} mutational changes is strand slippage in repetitive DNA sequences without concomitant repair. We established a genetic assay that allows measuring the stability of GT repeats in the ade 6 gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In repair-proficient strains most of the repeat variations were insertions, with addition of two nucleotides being the most frequent event. GT repeats were highly destabilized in strains defective in msh 2 or pms 1. In these backgrounds, mainly 2 -bp insertions and 2 -bp deletions occurred. Surprisingly, essentially the same high mutation rate was found with mutants defective in msh 6. In contrast, a defect in swi 4 (a homologue of Msh 3) caused only slight effects, and instability was not further increased in msh 6 swi 4 double mutants. Also inactivation of exo 1, which encodes an exonuclease that has an MMR-dependent function in repair of base-base mismatches, caused only slightly increased repeat instability. We conclude that Msh 2, Msh 6, and Pms 1 {{have an important role}} in preventing tract length variations in dinucleotide repeats. Exo 1 and Swi 4 have a <b>minor</b> <b>function,</b> which is at least partially independent of MMR...|$|E

40|$|New genes with novel {{functions}} arise by duplication and divergence, but {{the process}} poses a problem. After duplication, an extra gene copy must rise to sufficiently high frequency in the population and remain free of common inactivating lesions long enough to acquire the rare mutations that provide a new selectable function. Maintaining a duplicated gene by selection for the original function would restrict the freedom to diverge. (We refer to this problem as Ohno's dilemma). A model is described by which selection continuously favors both maintenance of the duplicate copy and divergence of that copy from the parent gene. Before duplication, the original gene has a trace side activity (the innovation) {{in addition to its}} original function. When an altered ecological niche makes the minor innovation valuable, selection favors increases in its level (the amplification), which is most frequently conferred by increased dosage of the parent gene. Selection for the amplified <b>minor</b> <b>function</b> maintains the extra copies and raises the frequency of the amplification in the population. The same selection favors mutational improvement of any of the extra copies, which are not constrained to maintain their original function (the divergence). The rate of mutations (per genome) that improve the new function is increased by the multiplicity of target copies within a genome. Improvement of some copies relaxes selection on others and allows their loss by mutation (becoming pseudogenes). Ultimately one of the extra copies is able to provide all of the new activity...|$|E
40|$|Full text {{available}} on WestlawThe judicial appellate {{function of the}} Special Commissioners of Income Tax was given to them when income tax was reintroduced by Sir Robert Peel in 1842. Over the next 100 years this initially <b>minor</b> <b>function</b> gradually came to dominate {{the work of the}} tribunal. In constitution and nature the Special Commissioners were unequivocally an arm of the Executive, a dispute resolution body made up of paid civil servants, but nevertheless they established themselves as a body with predominantly judicial functions within the highly specialised field of tax. While the notion of access to justice was not articulated as a discrete concept, its principal constituent elements of simplicity, cheapness, speed, proximity and effectiveness of dispute resolution were recognised as desirable qualities within the nineteenth century legal process. They were equally desirable in the fiscal process, perhaps even more so, since the aim of that process was to ensure that government enjoyed a constant and predictable stream of public revenue. This paper examines {{the extent to which the}} Special Commissioners in their appellate function were, both in fact and in perception, accessible to the taxpaying public in the context of practical litigation and of the esoteric nature of tax and of the fiscal process.

40|$|Mast cell proteases are {{believed}} {{to participate in the}} basement membrane destruction in blistering diseases. Thus, normal human skin specimens were incubated with purified human skin tryptase or compound 48 / 80 (a mast cell degranulator) for up to 24 [*]h. Thereafter, the specimens were studied immunohistochemically. Tryptase caused, in the presence and absence of 1, 10 -phenanthroline, focal dermal–epidermal separation above laminin and almost complete disappearance of the staining of the extra domain A region of cellular fibronectin in and beneath the basement membrane. The immunopositivity of the cell-binding region of fibronectin, laminin, and collagens IV and VII, however, was unaltered. Compound 48 / 80 induced almost complete dermal–epidermal separation above intact laminin and only focal reduction in the extra domain A region of cellular fibronectin staining. These alterations by compound 48 / 80 were prevented partially by Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone or 1, 10 -phenanthroline alone but completely when both inhibitors were present suggesting the involvement of tryptic serine proteinases, probably also tryptase, and[*]metalloproteinases. Preventive effect of N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone was weak suggesting <b>minor</b> <b>function</b> of chymotryptic serine proteinases. When tryptase was incubated with heparin and pure plasma fibronectin, an abrupt decrease in the adherence of cultured keratinocytes on to plastic surface coated with these substances and a gradual plasma fibronectin cleavage to 173, 161, and 28 [*]kDa fragments in sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were found. In conclusion, tryptase can cause focal dermal–epidermal separation above laminin in skin specimens but it is not known to what extent the decreased keratinocyte adherence in[*]vitro and fibronectin cleavage are related to this dermal–epidermal separation...|$|E
