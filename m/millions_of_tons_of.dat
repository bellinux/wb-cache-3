500|$|On June 18, 1178, {{five or more}} monks from Canterbury {{reported}} an upheaval on the Moon shortly after sunset. [...] "There was a bright new moon, and as usual in that phase its horns were tilted toward the east; and suddenly the upper horn split in two. From the midpoint of this division a flaming torch sprang up, spewing out, over a considerable distance, fire, hot coals, and sparks. Meanwhile {{the body of the}} moon which was below writhed, as it were, in anxiety, and, {{to put it in the}} words of those who reported it to me and saw it with their own eyes, the moon throbbed like a wounded snake. Afterwards it resumed its proper state. This phenomenon was repeated a dozen times or more, the flame assuming various twisting shapes at random and then returning to normal. Then after these transformations the moon from horn to horn, that is along its whole length, took on a blackish appearance." [...] This description appears outlandish perhaps due to lacking public understanding of astronomical phenomena. In 1976, Jack Hartung proposed that this described the formation of the Giordano Bruno crater. However, more recent studies suggest that it appears very unlikely the 1178 event was related to the formation of Crater Giordano Bruno, or was even a true transient lunar phenomenon at all. The <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> lunar debris ejected from an impact large enough to leave a 22-km-wide crater would have resulted in an unprecedentedly intense, week-long meteor storm on Earth. No accounts of such a memorable storm have been found in any known historical records, including several astronomical archives from around the world. In light of this, it is suspected that the group of monks (the event's only known witnesses) saw the atmospheric explosion of a directly oncoming meteor in chance alignment, from their specific vantage point, with the far more distant moon.|$|E

A domestic microwave of 1000 W and 2. 45 GHz frequency was modified to accommodate fluidized bed system. It was found that OPF showed poor microwave absorbing characteristics. Therefore, an appropriate microwave-absorbing material such as biomass char was added to initiate the pyrolysis process. Temperature profiles and bio-oil yield was investigated by varying the ratio of OPF to microwave absorber. It was found that the yield of bio-oil depended on the ratio of OPF to microwave absorber. Particular attention on the temperature profiles was also taken into account during microwave heating of OPF. It can be concluded that microwave technique can save significant time and energy through its rapid and volumetric heating characteristic...|$|R

30|$|In The US, ethanol {{industry}} was invigorated {{in the early}} 80 ’s when it became economical to produce ethanol by fermentation. By the 90 ’s MTBE (methyl tertiary- butyl ether), totally replaced lead additives as octane enhancer. Since 2000, the almost uncontrolled growth {{of supply and demand}} of ethanol, replacing MTBE (methyl tertiary- butyl ether), also alleviated some of the dependence to oil. In 2005, the renewable fuel standard (RFS) program was created under the Energy Policy Act (EPAct of 2005), and established the first renewable fuel volume mandate in the United States, this program required 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuel to be blended into gasoline by 2012 (Environmental Protection Agency. 2005). From the environmental point of view, replacing MTBE and tetraethyl lead with ethanol as octane enhancer, reduced not only groundwater contamination but also harmful tailpipe emissions (e.g. for 2010, the production and use of more than 13 billion gallons of domestic ethanol reduced 21.9 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 e) (Renewable Fuels Association, 2011 a).|$|R
