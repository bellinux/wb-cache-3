One theory suggests that the entire Red Sea basin is underlain by oceanic crust, while another theory claims that the <b>main</b> <b>trough</b> is underlain only in part by oceanic crust. A third theory suggests that outside the axial trough, the crust has a continental composition, with the presence of basaltic dykes, while another hypothesis suggests that the lower crust in the rift consists of rift meta-sediments, in direct contact with the upper mantle. All geophysical data from the axial trough reveal seismic velocities typical for oceanic crust. The <b>main</b> <b>trough,</b> however, is characterized by a high degree of lateral variation, with abrupt changes in basement velocities from typical continental to typical oceanic signatures.|$|E

It also drained to the Chehalis River until the Chimacum Valley, in the northeast Olympic Peninsula, melted, allowing the lake's water to rapidly drain north into the marine waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which was rising as the ice sheet retreated.|$|E

The results of simulation of the behaviour of the high-latitude ionosphere, in particular, the heat regime of the F-layer, are presented and analysed. From our study, {{it was found that}} electron-temperature hot spots in the <b>main</b> ionospheric <b>trough</b> can arise owing to internal ionospheric processes, and not due to effects of any external causes. Three conditions, to be satisfied simultaneously, are necessary for the formation of the considered electron-temperature hot spots: first, low values of electron density; second, solar illumination of the upper F region and darkness of the lower F region; third, low values of neutral-component densities. These conditions are valid in the <b>main</b> ionospheric <b>trough</b> near the terminator on the nightside when the density of the neutral atmosphere is not high. The physical processes which lead to the formation of the electron-temperature hot spots are the heat transfer from the upper into the lower F region, the reduced heat capacity of electron gas and the weakened cooling of electron gas due to inelastic collisions with neutral atoms and molecules. Also investigated is the influence of seasonal and solar-activity variations on the efficiency of the identified mechanism responsible for the formation of the electron temperature peaks in the <b>main</b> ionospheric <b>trough</b> by the internal processes...|$|R

Telford's stonemason instincts initially led him to consider replacing the original structure with another stone-built aqueduct, but the heavy involvement of iron-masters in the Shrewsbury Canal Company, notably William Reynolds, led him to reconsider. Instead, it was rebuilt using a 62 yd cast iron trough cast in sections at Reynolds' Ketley ironworks and bolted together in 1796. The <b>main</b> <b>trough</b> was 7.5 ft wide and 4.5 ft deep, with a narrower trough to one side which formed the towpath. The aqueduct was the world's first large-scale iron navigable aqueduct, though it was narrowly predated by a much smaller 44 ft structure on the Derby Canal built by Benjamin Outram. The aqueduct still stands today, though it is isolated {{in the middle of}} a field. This successful use of an iron trough to contain the water of a navigable aqueduct casts the Tern aqueduct in the role of Telford's prototype for the much longer Pontcysyllte Aqueduct on the Llangollen Canal, where he mounted the iron trough on high masonry arches.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Befitting {{the venue}} of this meeting, we first {{investigate}} the polar ionosphere. The most pressing {{problem here is}} that no reliable description of this region is available, not even for undisturbed conditions. To improve on this situation we have investigated the properties of some of the more prominent anomalies observed in this region, including the heating effect below the magne-tospheric cusp, the subauroral electron temperature enhancement and the <b>main</b> ionospheric <b>trough.</b> Using DE- 2 satellite data, we find, for example, that all these features move towards lower latitudes with increasing geomagnetic activ-ity in a systematic way. We also show that the subauroral electron temperature enhancement and the <b>main</b> ionospheric <b>trough</b> are co-located, on average. With regard to the mid-latitude region, the positive phase of ionospheric storms re-mains the most challenging problem. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including neutral gas composition changes, equa-torward directed winds, and east- and northward directed electric fields. Up to now, the measurements available are not sufficient to single out the correct explanation(s). Ionospheric holes {{are one of the most}} spectacular disturbance effects observed at equatorial latitudes. These holes are marked by a steep drop in the electron density to very low values. Also their bottom is rather flat and almost without any structure. Different explanations of this phenomenon have been offered, none of which is generally accepted. ...|$|R

This subauroral path with the length of about 6600 km has approximately an east-west orientation. The main goals are to carry out numerical modeling of radio propagation for the path and to compare the model calculations with experimental results. Wave absorption and effects of focusing and divergence of rays were taken into consideration in the radio wave modeling process. The following basic results were obtained: The signal amplitude increases by 20 ? 30 dB 1 ? 1. 5 h before the substorm expansion phase onset. At {{the same time the}} signal azimuth deviates towards north of the great circle arc for the propagation path. Compared with quiet periods there are effects due to irregularities and gradients {{in the area of the}} polar edge of the <b>main</b> ionospheric <b>trough</b> on the passing signals. Propagation mechanisms also change during substorms. The growth of signal amplitude before the substorm can be physically explained by both a decrease of the F 2 -layer ionization and a growth of the F 2 -layer height that leads to a decrease of the signal field divergence and to a drop of the collision frequency. Ionospheric gradients are also important. This increase of signal level prior to a substorm could be used for forecasting of space weather disturbed conditions...|$|R

A high resolution velocity model with a 750 m x 750 m x 400 m grid spacing was built, using multibeam bathymetry and wide-angle seismic data, in order to account for the velocity contrast at the water/sediment interface and the slow seismic velocities within the sediment infill in the <b>main</b> Marmara <b>Trough.</b> The velocity model developed by KOERI for the whole Marmara region by merging land and sea stations appears to be very useful {{to improve the quality of}} earthquake catalogs and the real time monitoring of the regional seismicity.

40|$|Although motion between Arabia and Africa is {{presently}} occurring {{along the entire}} length of the Red Sea, the morphology and tectonics that result from this motion vary greatly along its length. South of 21 °N, the <b>main</b> <b>trough</b> is bisected by a deep axial trough which has formed by sea-floor spreading during the past 4 m. y. and is associated with large-amplitude magnetic anomalies and high heat flow. North of 25 °N, an axial trough is not present and the floor of the <b>main</b> <b>trough</b> has an irregular faulted appearance. The magnetic field in the north is characterized by smooth low-amplitude anomalies with a few isolated higher amplitude magnetic anomalies commonly associated with gravity anomalies and in many places probably due to intrusions. Between these regions, the axial trough is discontinuous with a series of deeps characterized by large-amplitude magnetic anomalies alternating with shallower intertrough zones which lack magnetic anomalies. It is argued that the different regions represent successive phases in the rifting of a continent and the development of a continental margin. An initial period of diffuse extension by rotational faulting and dike injection over an area perhaps 100 km (60 mi) wide is followed by concentration of extension at a single axis and the initiation of sea-floor spreading. The <b>main</b> <b>trough</b> in the southern Red Sea, away from the deep axial trough, formed during the Miocene by the same processes of diffuse extension that are still active in the northern Red Sea.

The initial pre-sea-floor spreading stage results in considerable extension (160 km or 100 mi) at 25 °N in the Red Sea), can last for several tens of millions of years, and is an important factor in the development of the continental margin.

Mapping of subglacial geomorphology builds upon recent methodological advances that use optical and passive satellite imagery of the ice surface to infer major elements of the subglacial topography. The hypothesised geomorphological map reveals an alpine glacial landscape at, and surrounding, every nunatak region, inferred through the presence of subaerial and subglacial cirques, arêtes and closely spaced hanging valleys. A series of subglacial troughs are found to intersect the <b>main</b> Jutulstraumen–Penck <b>troughs.</b> The map is aimed at helping analyse patterns and processes of landscape evolution within WDML and provides greater detail of erosion patterns associated with former ice flow patterns...|$|R
