50|$|Eledone moschata, the <b>musky</b> <b>octopus,</b> is {{a species}} of octopus that lives in the Mediterranean Sea. It grows up to 740 mm long, and feeds {{on a wide range}} of crustaceans, {{molluscs}} and fish.|$|E
50|$|Bandfish are an {{important}} part of the diets of many oceanic predators, especially john dories, but also other fish, common dolphins and the <b>musky</b> <b>octopus,</b> Eledone moschata. Bandfish may have taken up an ecological niche burrowing and eating zooplakton due to strong pressures from predators.|$|E
5000|$|Eledone microsicya is {{a little-known}} species of octopus {{from the western}} Indian Ocean. [...] There is a view {{that because of the}} {{similarity}} in the skins of the single specimen of E. microsicya to the <b>Musky</b> <b>Octopus</b> Eledone moschata {{that this is not a}} valid taxon and represents a Red Sea population of the otherwise Mediteraranean E. moschata.|$|E
50|$|The largest {{recorded}} <b>musky</b> <b>octopus</b> was a {{male with}} a mantle length of 188 mm, a total length of 740 mm and a mass of 1414 g, caught in the Gulf of İzmir (Gulf of Smyrna), in the Aegean Sea. It {{is closely related to}} the horned octopus, Eledone cirrhosa, but can be distinguished by a number of features; for example, E. moschata has smooth skin and smells of musk, while E. cirrhosa has warty skin and no musky odour.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} seasons on lipid and fatty acid {{profiles}} of muscle types (mantle and arm) of Mediterranean octopuses (common octopus-Octopus vulgaris and musky octopus-Eledone moschata) were investigated. The {{results showed that}} lipid levels ranged from 0. 75 % to 1. 60 % in both muscle types of octopuses which were considered as lean. Lipid levels in mantle tissues of both octopus species were higher than lipid levels in their arms. Although these two octopus species contain small amounts of lipid, they are good sources of n- 3 PUFAs content (especially EPA and DHA) for all season regardless of muscle types. The highest levels of EPA were obtained from mantle and arms tissues (18. 23 %) of common octopus in spring. The highest levels of EPA were obtained from mantle (12. 90 %) and arms (12. 67 %) of <b>musky</b> <b>octopus</b> in autumn and winter. The levels of EPA in both of muscle tissues of common octopus {{were found to be}} higher than levels of EPA in both of muscle tissues of <b>musky</b> <b>octopus.</b> The highest DHA levels were obtained from mantle tissue (28. 17 %) of common octopus in summer. There were significant differences (p< 0. 05) in the levels of SFA, MUFA and PUFA in terms of species, season, and muscle types...|$|E
40|$|Length-weight relationships, sex ratio, {{maturity}} patterns, reproductive outputs, fecundity and spawning {{period of}} the <b>musky</b> <b>octopus</b> Eledone moschata (Lamarck, 1798) in the northern and central Adriatic Sea are presented for the first time. Samples were collected {{on a monthly basis}} by commercial bottom trawls between October 2001 and June 2003. A total of 1552 specimens were analysed (779 males, 764 females, 9 undetermined). The overall sex ratio was close to 1 : 1, but during summer males were dominant. Length-weight relationships calculated for each sex and the whole sample showed negative allometric growth (...|$|E
40|$|<b>Musky</b> <b>octopus,</b> Eledone moschata is {{widespread}} in the Mediterranean on various bottom types. Although it is common in fishery landings its ecology is still poorly known. The life span of this species is up to two years. Females can spawn in wide period, ranging from {{couple of days to}} few months. This study was designed as an attempt to culture octopus paralarvae and to determine food requirements of the newly hatched individuals. »Fake« spawning in experimental conditions was observed. Condition of eggs in the laboratory together with behaviour of the female during this experiment is described...|$|E
