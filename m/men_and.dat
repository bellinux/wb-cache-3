40|$|Women in Love is {{interpreted}} as a novel of relationships between <b>man</b> <b>and</b> woman, <b>man</b> <b>and</b> nature, and mind and body. D. H.

5|$|Female {{homosexuality}} has {{not received}} the same negative response from religious or criminal authorities as male homosexuality or adultery has throughout history. Whereas sodomy between men, <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women, and <b>men</b> <b>and</b> animals was punishable by death in Britain, acknowledgment of sexual contact between women was nonexistent in medical and legal texts. The earliest law against female homosexuality appeared in France in 1270. In Spain, Italy, and the Holy Roman Empire, sodomy between women was included in acts considered unnatural and punishable by burning to death, although few instances are recorded of this taking place.|$|E

5|$|In the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} make the claim for gender {{equality}} using the same arguments or the same language that late 19th- and 20th century feminists later would. For instance, rather than unequivocally stating that <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women are equal, Wollstonecraft contends that <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women are equal in the eyes of God, which means that they are both subject to the same moral law. For Wollstonecraft, <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women are equal in the most important areas of life. While such an idea may not seem revolutionary to 21st-century readers, its implications were revolutionary during the 18th century. For example, it implied that both <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women—not just women—should be modest and respect the sanctity of marriage. Wollstonecraft's argument exposed the sexual double standard of the late 18th century and demanded that men adhere to the same virtues demanded of women.|$|E

5|$|Only just {{escaping}} capture, Blücher {{crossed the}} forest of Vertus and took up positions at Étoges with Prince Urusov's division, which had been left there in reserve. Russian General Udom, with 1,800 <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 15 cannon, was instructed to cover the position, by occupying the park at Étoges. Udom's men were exhausted after the long retreat and fighting and, seeing that night had fallen, thought themselves in safety. However, Doumerc's cuirassiers, formed unseen in the night, surprised these <b>men</b> <b>and</b> a single charge was enough to send the panicked men fleeing. Prince Urusov, 600 <b>men</b> <b>and</b> eight artillery pieces were captured during this action, with the French sailors' regiment from Lagrange's division subsequently entering the village of Étoges. Blücher abandoned this position too and made a hasty retreat towards Vertus and Bergères.

Bardylis, hearing of the preparations, sent ambassadors to Philip, proposing peace {{on the basis of the}} status quo. Philip rejected this, insisting that the Illyrians must withdraw completely from Macedonia, so Bardylis instead prepared for battle, raising 10,000 <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 500 cavalry, according to Diodorus.|$|E
