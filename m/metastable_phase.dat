50|$|For {{nickel-chromium}} and iron-chromium alloys, {{short range}} order {{can be designed}} on the nano-scale (<5 nm) that absorbs the interstitial and vacancy's generated by PKA events. This allows materials that mitigate the swelling that normally occurs {{in the presence of}} high DPAs and keep the overall volume percent change under the ten percent range. This occurs through generating a <b>metastable</b> <b>phase</b> that is in constant, dynamic equilibrium with surrounding material. This <b>metastable</b> <b>phase</b> is characterized by having an enthalpy of mixing that is effectively zero with respect to the main lattice. This allows phase transformation to absorb and disperse the point defects that typically accumulate in more rigid lattices. This extends the life of the alloy through making vacancy and interstitial creation less successful as constant neutron excitement in the form of displacement cascades transform the SRO phase, while the SRO reforms in the bulk solid solution.|$|E

50|$|Vaterite, like aragonite, is a <b>metastable</b> <b>phase</b> {{of calcium}} {{carbonate}} at ambient {{conditions at the}} surface of the earth. As it is less stable than either calcite or aragonite, vaterite has a higher solubility than either of these phases. Therefore, once vaterite is exposed to water, it converts to calcite (at low temperature) or aragonite (at high temperature: ~60 °C). At 37 °C for example a solution-mediated transition from vaterite to calcite occurs, where the latter one dissolves and subsequently precipitate as calcite assisted by an Ostwald ripening process.|$|E

Coleman found the most likely decay pathway for vacuum decay and calculated the inverse lifetime per unit volume. He eventually noted that gravitational effects would be significant, but he did not calculate these effects and did not apply the results to cosmology.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} trace {{elements}} Cd and Sn on precipitation process of Al-Si-Cu-Mg cast alloys were investigated {{in the present}} research. It is shown that the addition of Cd and Sn not only increases remarkably the aging peak hardness and reduces the time to reach aging peak, but also eliminates the double-aging-peak phenomenon which appears in Al-Si-Cu-Mg alloys. In Al-Si-Cu-Mg alloys the first aging peak corresponds to GP zones (especially GPⅡ), and the second one is caused by <b>metastable</b> <b>phases.</b> The obvious time interval of transition from GPⅡ to <b>metastable</b> <b>phases</b> associates with the double-aging-peak phenomenon. The results of DSC and TEM show that Cd/Sn elements suppress the formation of GPⅠzone, stimulate the formation of θ'', θ' and θ phases, and then shorten remarkably the temperature intervals of each exothermic peak. Because thetransition interval between GPⅡzone and <b>metastable</b> <b>phases</b> is shortened by Cd/Sn in Al-Si-Cu-Mg cast alloys, θ' phase coexists with θ'' phase in matrix of ageing peak condition, which causes effective hardening on the alloys, {{and at the same}} time, eliminates the double-aging-peak phenomenon...|$|R

Multiple pop-ins and pop-out events on Si have been reported; the cause of the pop-ins is not clear at this time, but the pop-out is ascribed to the reason of phase transformation. Micro-Raman spectroscopy demonstrated its ability to detect phase changes beneath the Si surface, giving different signature at different location surrounding the indentation. The extra Raman bands from the <b>metastable</b> <b>phases</b> of Si-III and Si-XII are clearly visible in the continuous load-unload cycle, consistent with the XTEM observations.|$|R

At room temperature, Ag2MoO4 exhibits a spinel-type cubic structure related to beta (β-Ag2MoO4) phase, which is more stable in nature. However, when exposed to high hydrostatic pressure, these crystals have a tetragonal structure associated to alpha (α-Ag2MoO4) <b>metastable</b> <b>phase.</b> Recently, the literature [...] has reported the formation of α-Ag2MoO4 <b>metastable</b> <b>phase</b> by the solution-phase precipitation method under environment condition, and using 3-bis(2-pyridyl)pyrazine (dpp) as doping. The influence of pH at starting solution on the growth and formation processes of distinct heterostructures (brooms, flowers and rods) was investigated by Singh et al. and Fodjo et al., in which the sodium borohydride was employed to induce the reduction of silver nanoparticles {{on the surface of}} Ag2MoO4 crystals in order to enhance the Raman scattering. In other studies, Ag-Ag2MoO4 composites prepared by microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis presented interesting photocatalytic activity for the degradation of Rhodamine B under visible light. In addition, Ag2MoO4 mixed with graphite acts as a good lubricant for Ni-based composites, improving the tribological properties of this system. Different synthesis methods have been employed to obtain pure β-Ag2MoO4 crystals, including solid-state reaction or oxide mixture at high temperature, melt-quenching [...] and Czochralski growth. Particularly, high temperatures, long processing times, and/or sophisticated equipment are necessary in these synthetic routes. Moreover, the final products may be composed of irregular particle shapes with nonhomogeneous size distribution as well as contain the presence of secondary phases.

50|$|While {{exceptions}} exist, most flame-made {{particles are}} nano-sized (< 100 nm) and highly crystalline. Also, neither phase separation within each particle nor composition variance among particles is observed, {{as the entire}} process is so rapid that atomically mixed particles are formed. Their properties stem from the flame temperature (up to 2000 °C) and high cooling rates (>500 °C/s). Low residence times in the flame (the amount of time metal ions spend in the flame zone) and rapid cooling lead to <b>metastable</b> <b>phase</b> formation and more importantly unaggregated particles, as {{they do not have}} the energy to coalesce and neck. The purity of the initial reactants largely drives the final powder's purity. Some carbonate species may be present on as-produced powders; however, processing techniques can minimize these impurities in final products. First, the powder is dispersed in a solvent via ultrasonication and left to sit for 8 to 12 hours, which leads to some small fraction of larger particles, mostly carbonates, settling at the bottom. The suspension is separated from the sediment and is dried in an oven before being ground into a powder. Thus, LF-FSP provides a robust, versatile route to single and mixed-metal oxide powders in the 15-100 nm size range with varying phase and morphology from relatively low-cost organic precursors.|$|E
50|$|White {{cast iron}} {{displays}} white fractured surfaces {{due to the}} presence of an iron carbide precipitate called cementite. With a lower silicon content (graphitizing agent) and faster cooling rate, the carbon in white cast iron precipitates out of the melt as the <b>metastable</b> <b>phase</b> cementite, Fe3C, rather than graphite. The cementite which precipitates from the melt forms as relatively large particles. As the iron carbide precipitates out, it withdraws carbon from the original melt, moving the mixture toward one that is closer to eutectic, and the remaining phase is the lower iron-carbon austenite (which on cooling might transform to martensite). These eutectic carbides are much too large to provide the benefit of what is called precipitation hardening (as in some steels, where much smaller cementite precipitates might inhibit plastic deformation by impeding the movement of dislocations through the pure iron ferrite matrix). Rather, they increase the bulk hardness of the cast iron simply by virtue of their own very high hardness and their substantial volume fraction, such that the bulk hardness can be approximated by a rule of mixtures. In any case, they offer hardness at the expense of toughness. Since carbide makes up a large fraction of the material, white cast iron could reasonably be classified as a cermet. White iron is too brittle for use in many structural components, but with good hardness and abrasion resistance and relatively low cost, it finds use in such applications as the wear surfaces (impeller and volute) of slurry pumps, shell liners and lifter bars in ball mills and autogenous grinding mills, balls and rings in coal pulverisers, and the teeth of a backhoe's digging bucket (although cast medium-carbon martensitic steel is more common for this application).|$|E
