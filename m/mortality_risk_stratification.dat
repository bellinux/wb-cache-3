40|$|Thyroid {{cancer is}} an {{increasingly}} common malignancy, with a rapidly rising prevalence worldwide. The {{social and economic}} ramifications {{of the increase in}} thyroid cancer are multiple. Though mortality from thyroid cancer is low, and most patients will do well, the risk of recurrence is not insignificant, up to 30 %. Therefore, it is important to accurately identify those patients who are more or less likely to be burdened by their disease over years and tailor their treatment plan accordingly. The goal of <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> is to do just that. The <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> process generally starts postoperatively with histopathologic staging, based on the AJCC/UICC staging system as well as others designed to predict mortality. These do not, however, accurately assess the risk of recurrence/persistence. Patients initially considered to be at high risk may ultimately do very well yet be burdened by frequent unnecessary monitoring. Conversely, patients initially thought to be low risk, may not respond to their initial treatment as expected and, if left unmonitored, may have higher morbidity. The concept of risk-adaptive management has been adopted, with an understanding that <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> for differentiated thyroid cancer is dynamic and ongoing. A multitude of variables not included in AJCC/UICC staging are used initially to classify patients as low, intermediate, or high risk for recurrence. Over the course of time, a response-to-therapy variable is incorporated, and patients essentially undergo continuous <b>risk</b> <b>stratification.</b> Additional tools such as biochemical markers, genetic mutations, and molecular markers have been added to this complex <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> process such that this is essentially a continuum of risk. In recent years, additional considerations have been discussed with a suggestion of pre-operative <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> based on certain clinical and/or biologic characteristics.

METHODS: -We identified in a multicentre approach adults with ES under follow-up between 2000 and 2015. We examined survival and its association with clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and laboratory parameters. RESULTS: -We studied 1098 patients (median age 34. 4 years, range 16. 1 - 84. 4 years, 65. 1 % female, 31. 9 % with Down syndrome). The majority had a post-tricuspid defect (n= 643, 58. 6 %), followed by patients with a complex (n= 315, 28. 7 %) and pre-tricuspid lesion (n=, 12. 7 %). Over a median follow-up of 3. 1 years [IQR 1. 4 - 5. 9], allowing for 4361. 6 patient-years observation, 278 patients died and six and six underwent transplantation. Twelve parameters emerged as significant predictors of death on univariable analysis. On multivariable Cox regression analysis only age (HR 1. 41 / 10 years, 95 %CI 1. 24 - 1. 59, P< 0. 001), pre-tricuspid shunt (HR 1. 56, 95 %CI 1. 02 - 2. 39, P= 0. 041), oxygen saturation at rest (HR 0. 53 / 10 %, 95 %CI 0. 43 - 0. 65, P< 0. 001), presence of sinus rhythm (HR 0. 53, 95 %CI 0. 32 - 0. 88, P= 0. 013) and presence of pericardial effusion (HR 2. 41, 95 %CI 1. 59 - 3. 66, P< 0. 001) remained significant predictors of death.

40|$|Background: The United Network for Organ Sharing {{mandates}} a psychosocial {{assessment of}} transplant candidates before listing. A quantified measure for determining transplant candidacy is the Psychosocial Assessment of Candidates for Transplant (PACT) scale. This instrument's predictive value for survival {{has not been}} rigorously evaluated among lung transplantation recipients. Methods: We reviewed medical records of all patients who underwent lung transplantation at Mayo Clinic, Rochester from 2000 - 2012. A transplant psychiatrist had assessed lung transplant candidates for psychosocial risk with the PACT scale. Recipients were divided into high-and low psychosocial risk cohorts using a PACT score cutoff of 2. The main outcome variable was posttransplant survival. Mortality was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: This study included 110 lung recipients: 57 (51. 8 %) were females, 101 (91. 8 %) Whites, mean age: 56. 4 years. Further, 7 (6. 4 %) recipients received an initial PACT score = 2 (acceptable, good or great candidates). An initial PACT score < 2 was modestly associated with higher mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 2. 73, p = 0. 04). Conclusions: Lung transplant recipients who initially received a low score on the PACT scale, reflecting poor or borderline psychosocial candidacy, experienced greater likelihood of mortality.

Materials and Methods: Eighty-four consecutive patients presenting with perforation peritonitis, in {{the age group of}} 14 - 70 years scheduled for emergency laparotomy were studied prospectively. The parameters studied were age and sex of the patients, associated co-morbidities, duration of symptoms, delay in initiating surgical intervention, and preoperative biochemical parameters such as hemoglobin, random blood sugar, blood urea, serum creatinine, pH, base excess, and serum lactate levels. In-hospital mortality was taken as the outcome. Results: We encountered a mortality of 17. 8 % in our study. Multiple linear (enter) regression identified the age, duration of symptoms, preoperative blood sugar levels, blood urea, serum creatinine levels, Mannheim Peritonitis Index, and the delay in instituting surgical intervention as independent predictors of mortality. Hyperlactatemia, acidosis and base excess were not found to be associated with mortality.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to review the outcomes of patients who had received coronary stenting before CABG, and to examine the validity of a <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> system in this patient group. Methods: From 2010 to 2012, 439 patients who underwent isolated CABG at our medical center were reviewed. The patients were divided into two study groups: those who had previously received coronary artery stenting (97 patients, 24. 7 %), and those who had not (342 patients, 75. 3 %). The patients who received balloon angioplasty were excluded. Results: There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics. The prior stenting group had a lower risk of mortality, although the difference was not significant. The prior stenting group had fewer graft anastomoses (p =  0. 005), and hence a significantly shorter cardiopulmonary bypass time (p =  0. 045) and shorter aortic cross-clamping time. Surgical mortality was similar between the two groups. The durations of intensive care unit stay and hospitalization were also similar. The discriminatory power of the logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) was lower in both group.

However, {{it is difficult to}} assess the prognosis for patients with a variable number and size of tumors. By combining these two factors, we investigated the role and prognostic accuracy of total tumor volume (TTV) for HCC. Methods A total of 786 patients undergoing locoregional therapy (transarterial chemoembolization, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation and acetic acid or ethanol injection) for HCC were prospectively evaluated. Results The mean and median TTV was 177 cm 3 (range, 0. 1 - 3, 591 cm 3) and 21 cm 3, respectively. Of all, 38 %, 29 %, 15 %, 7 % and 11 % of patients had TTV of 3, 10 - 50 cm 3, 50 - 200 cm 3, 200 - 500 cm 3 and > 500 cm 3, respectively. TTV was significantly larger in patients with higher serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) levels or with vascular invasion. The Child-Turcotte-Pugh score, performance status, vascular invasion, AFP level and TTV were significant independent prognostic predictors in the Cox proportional hazards model. After adjustment, patients with TTV 50 - 200 cm 3 (relative risk [RR]: 1. 74, p = 0. 009), 200 - 500 cm 3 (RR: 2. 15, p = 0. 006) and > 500 cm 3 (RR: 3. 92, p 3.

Although earlier trials used programmed electrical stimulation (PES) for risk stratification, more recent data demonstrate the benefit of implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) in selected patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) without performing PES. However, {{little is known about}} the outcome of non-inducible patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of PES for <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> in patients with ICM. Methods: All consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria (history of coronary artery disease, LVEF≤ 35 %, and absence of documented spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia or aborted sudden cardiac death) were included in the study. The stimulation protocol involved up to three extrastimuli from two different sites in the right ventricle, with 180  ms as the shortest coupling interval. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Results: A total of 198 patients were included in the study; of these, 60 exhibited negative (−) PES, and 138 had positive (+) PES and also underwent ICD implantation. The mean follow-up duration was 4. 5 years. There was no difference in age or LVEF between the patient groups. We found a trend towards an increased 5 -year survival rate in the (+) PES group in whom ICD implantation had been performed (p= 0. 058). Survival was significantly better in patients under 68 year olds in the (+) PES group in whom ICD implantation was performed (hazard ratio= 0. 3, p= 0. 01).

Methods. We performed a 4 -year prospective follow-up study in 231 chronic PD patients from a single regional dialysis centre in Hong Kong. Valvular calcification was detected using echocardiography, and fasting venous blood was collected to measure a panel of inflammation markers. The patients were stratified into five groups {{on the basis of}} 0, 1, 2, 3 and all 4 inflammation and calcification risk markers, namely high C-reactive protein (CRP) (CRP in upper tertile), high interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) (IL- 6 in upper tertile), low fetuin-A (fetuin-A in lower tertile) and valvular calcification. Study outcomes included all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events (CVEs). Results. The patients with 4, 3, 2 and 1 markers had an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5. 17 (95 CI, 1. 81 - 14. 77, P = 0. 002), 3. 38 (95 CI, 1. 50 - 7. 60; P = 0. 003), 2. 17 (95 CI, 0. 98 - 4. 77; P = 0. 056) and 2. 42 (95 CI, 1. 18 - 4. 96; P = 0. 016), respectively, for mortality at 4 years than those with 0 risk marker. The adjusted HRs for fatal or non-fatal CVEs were 4. 33 (95 CI, 1. 70 - 11. 03; P = 0. 002), 1. 60 (95 CI, 0. 73 - 3. 52; P = 0. 24), 1. 92 (95 CI, 0. 95 - 3. 90; P = 0. 07) and 1. 33 (95 CI, 0. 67 - 2. 62; P = 0. 42), respectively, for patients with 4, 3, 2 and 1 markers than those with 0 risk markers.

The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the prevalence and correlates of unrecognizedMI and the associationwithmortality in the general population. Methods: All participants >= 18 years participating in the Lifelines population, a three- generation Cohort Study and Biobank, were included (n= 152, 180). Participants with unrecognized MI were matched with controls without MI (1 : 2) based on age and gender. Unrecognized MI was defined when no history of MI was reported in combinationwith electrocardiographic (ECG) signs corresponding to MI. A history ofMIwas defined as a reported history of MI in combination with ECG signs and/ or the use of antithrombotic medication. Results: MI was present in 1881 (1. 2 %) of participants and was unrecognized in 431 (22. 9 %) participants. Under the age of 50 years, percentages of unrecognized MI relative to the total amount of MI were 34 % and 55 % in men and women respectively. Compared to recognized MI, classical cardiovascular risk factors were less prevalent in participants with unrecognized MI. During a median follow- up time of 5, 4 and 4 years, 4. 4 %, 6. 4 % and 2. 2 % of participants with unrecognizedMI, recognized MI and without MI died, respectively.

However, their application to biomedical text classification, particularly to <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> among intensive care unit (ICU) patients, has not been thoroughly studied. ObjectiveTo develop and characterize sparse classifiers based on the free text of nursing notes in order to predict ICU mortality risk and to discover text features most strongly associated with mortality. MethodsWe selected nursing notes from the first 24 h of ICU admission for 25, 826 adult ICU patients from the MIMIC-II database. We then developed a pair of stochastic gradient descent-based classifiers with elastic-net regularization. We also studied the performance-sparsity tradeoffs of both classifiers as their regularization parameters were varied. ResultsThe best-performing classifier achieved a 10 -fold cross-validated AUC of 0. 897 under the log loss function and full L 2 regularization, while full L 1 regularization used just 0. 00025 % of candidate input features and resulted in an AUC of 0. 889. Using the log loss (range of AUCs 0. 889 – 0. 897) yielded better performance compared to the hinge loss (0. 850 – 0. 876), but the latter yielded even sparser models. DiscussionMost features selected by both classifiers appear clinically relevant and correspond to predictors already present in existing ICU mortality models. The sparser classifiers were also able to discover a number of informative – albeit nonclinical – features. ConclusionThe elastic-net-regularized classifiers perform reasonably well and are capable of {{reducing the number of}} features required by over a thousandfold, with only a modest impact on performance...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundPatients with ischemic {{cardiomyopathy}} (ICM) are at {{an increased}} risk for sudden death. Although earlier trials used programmed electrical stimulation (PES) for risk stratification, more recent data demonstrate the benefit of implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) in selected patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) without performing PES. However, {{little is known about}} the outcome of non-inducible patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of PES for <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> in patients with ICM. MethodsAll consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria (history of coronary artery disease, LVEF≤ 35 %, and absence of documented spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia or aborted sudden cardiac death) were included in the study. The stimulation protocol involved up to three extrastimuli from two different sites in the right ventricle, with 180 ms as the shortest coupling interval. The primary endpoint was overall survival. ResultsA total of 198 patients were included in the study; of these, 60 exhibited negative (−) PES, and 138 had positive (+) PES and also underwent ICD implantation. The mean follow-up duration was 4. 5 years. There was no difference in age or LVEF between the patient groups. We found a trend towards an increased 5 -year survival rate in the (+) PES group in whom ICD implantation had been performed (p= 0. 058). Survival was significantly better in patients under 68 year olds in the (+) PES group in whom ICD implantation was performed (hazard ratio= 0. 3, p= 0. 01). The survival rate of patients ≥ 68 years old was similar in both groups (p= 0. 95). ConclusionsNon-inducibility during PES does not predict the prognosis of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{incidence}} {{and severity of}} Clostridium difficile–associated disease (CDAD) within the general population has risen dramatically over the past decade, yet little data are available from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) centers. In the present study, we performed a chart review of 822 consecutive autologous and allogeneic HCST recipients treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital between 2004 and 2008 to determine the incidence of CDAD at our institution. Variables including age, sex, diagnosis, chemotherapy regimen, transplantation type, microbial colonization, coinfections, diet, antibiotic use, neutropenic fever, comorbid conditions, time to engraftment, growth factor administration, and occurrence of graft-versus-host disease were assessed as potential risk factors {{for the development of}} CDAD. Eighty-five CDAD cases (10. 3 %) were identified. Bivariate analysis revealed a significant association between CDAD and neutropenic fever, administration of a neutropenic diet, ciprofloxacin and aztreonam use and duration of therapy, vancomycin and aztreonam use and duration of therapy, receipt of an allogeneic transplantation, bacterial coinfection, and vancomycin-resistant Entereococcus faecium (VRE) colonization. Cox regression analysis identified the following as factors associated with the development of CDAD: age > 60 years, allogeneic transplantation, and prior VRE colonization. Allogeneic recipients with CDAD experienced increased higher rates of grades II to IV gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease and nonrelapse <b>mortality.</b> A <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> model was developed to identify HSCT recipients at different levels of risk. With an incidence > 10 %, CDAD is a significant infectious complication of stem cell transplantation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Acute decompensated {{heart failure}} {{is a common}} reason for {{presentation}} to the emergency department and is associated with high rates of admission to hospital.

40|$|ObjectiveRecent {{studies with}} {{asymptomatic}} carotid patients on best medical management {{have shown that}} the annual risk of stroke has decreased to approximately 1 %. There is no evidence that a similar decrease in mortality has occurred. In addition, the intensity of statin therapy for these patients has not yet been determined. The aims of this review were to determine (a) the reported long-term all-cause and cardiac-related mortality in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS)  >  50 %, (b) whether there has been a decrease in mortality in recent years, (c) the available methods of <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> <b>stratification,</b> and (d) whether the latest ACC/AHA guidelines on the treatment of serum lipids can be applied to this group of patients. MethodsSystematic review of PubMed, EuroPubMed, and Cochrane Library and meta-analysis using random effects for pooled proportions were performed regarding long-term all-cause and cardiac-related mortality and the associated risk factors in ACS patients. The last day for literature search was October 30, 2014. ResultsSeventeen studies were retrieved reporting 5 -year all-cause mortality in 11, 391 patients with ACS > 50 %. The 5 -year cumulative all-cause mortality across all 17 studies was 23. 6 % (95 % CI 20. 50 – 26. 80). Twelve additional studies, reporting both all-cause and cardiac mortality with a minimum of 2 year follow-up and involving 4, 072 patients were identified. Of the 930 deaths reported, 589 (62. 9 %; 95 % CI 58. 81 – 66. 89) were cardiac-related. This translates into an average cardiac-related mortality of 2. 9 % per year. ConclusionsAll-cause and cardiac mortality in ACS patients are very high. Although risk stratification is possible, most patients are classified as high risk. In view of this high risk, aggressive statin therapy is indicated if the new ACC/AHA guidelines on serum lipids are to be adhered to...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Autoantibodies {{directed}} against cytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase 1 A {{have been identified}} in many patients with inclusion body myositis. This retrospective study investigated the association between anticytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase 1 A antibody status and clinical, serological and histopathological features to explore the utility of this antibody to identify inclusion body myositis subgroups and to predict prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from various European inclusion body myositis registries were pooled. Anticytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase 1 A status was determined by an established ELISA technique. Cases were stratified according to antibody status and comparisons made. Survival and mobility aid requirement analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Data from 311 patients were available for analysis; 102 (33 %) had anticytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase 1 A antibodies. Antibody-positive patients had a higher adjusted mortality risk (HR 1. 89, 95 % CI 1. 11 to 3. 21, p= 0. 019), lower frequency of proximal upper limb weakness at disease onset (8 % vs 23 %, adjusted OR 0. 29, 95 % CI 0. 12 to 0. 68, p= 0. 005) and an increased prevalence of excess of cytochrome oxidase deficient fibres on muscle biopsy analysis (87 % vs 72 %, adjusted OR 2. 80, 95 % CI 1. 17 to 6. 66, p= 0. 020), compared with antibody-negative patients. INTERPRETATION: Differences were observed in clinical and histopathological features between anticytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase 1 A antibody positive and negative patients with inclusion body myositis, and antibody-positive patients had a higher adjusted <b>mortality</b> <b>risk.</b> <b>Stratification</b> of inclusion body myositis by anticytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase 1 A antibody status may be useful, potentially highlighting a distinct inclusion body myositis subtype with a more severe phenotype...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{determine}} the impact of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy in patients with familial arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). BackgroundArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is a cause of sudden cardiac death, which may be prevented by ICD. MethodsWe studied 11 families in which a 3 p 25 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) haplotype at locus ARVD 5 segregated with disease and compared mortality in subjects who received an ICD with that in control subjects who were matched for age, gender, ARVC status, and family. Subjects (n = 367) at 50 % a priori risk of inheriting ARVC were classified as high risk (HR) (n = 197), low risk (n = 92), or unknown (n = 78) {{on the basis of}} clinical events, DNA haplotyping, and/or pedigree position. Forty-eight HR subjects (30 males, [median age 32 years] and 18 females [median age 41 years]) were followed after ICD (secondary to ventricular tachycardia [VT] in 27 %). Survival was compared with 58 HR control subjects who were alive at the same age to-the-day at which the ICD subject received the device. ResultsIn the HR group, 50 % of males were dead by 39 years and females by 71 years: relative risk of death was 5. 1 (95 % confidence interval 3 to 8. 5) for males. The five-year mortality rate after ICD in males was zero compared with 28 % in control subjects (p = 0. 009). Within five years, the ICD fired for VT in 70 % and for VT > 240 beats/min in 30 %, with no difference in discharge rate when analyzed by ICD indication. ConclusionsThe unknown mutation at the ARVD 5 locus causing ARVC results in high <b>mortality.</b> <b>Risk</b> <b>stratification</b> using genetic haplotyping and ICD therapy produced improved survival for males...|$|E
30|$|The {{clinical}} CardShock risk score, including baseline lactate levels, {{was recently}} shown to facilitate <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> {{in patients with}} cardiogenic shock (CS). As based on baseline parameters, however, it may not reflect the change in <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> in response to initial therapies. Adrenomedullin is a prognostic biomarker in several cardiovascular diseases and was recently shown to associate with hemodynamic instability in patients with septic shock.

40|$|Early {{tracheal}} extubation {{has been}} the focus of recent attempts to accelerate the care of patients after aortocoronary bypass. Following the 1994 validation of a preoperative <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> mode based on the Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Cardiac Surgery Database, we examined the records of 328 aortocoronary bypass patients from our institution and identified 133 patients with low preoperative <b>mortality</b> <b>risk.</b> Their records were then analyzed for duration of tracheal intubation. One low-risk patient who did not survive was excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 132 patients, 108 experienced no postoperative complications; nevertheless, 50 of these were intubated longer than 10 hours despite freedom from complications. In a 2 nd group of 153 consecutive low-risk patients, we prospectively implemented a patient care protocol that designated low-risk patients as eligible for accelerated weaning. Compared were the 1 st group, these patients with low preoperative <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> were weaned from mechanical ventilation in 40 % less time. Thus, we found that low preoperative <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> predicts success in early tracheal extubation. <b>Risk</b> <b>stratification</b> appears to be a simple and useful means of identifying patients least likely to encounter postoperative complications. Risk-based accelerated recovery was successfully implemented without requiring a change in anesthetic or surgical management...|$|R
30|$|Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a {{state of}} global tissue {{hypoperfusion}} caused by severe cardiac dysfunction. In spite of advances in therapeutic options, the short-term mortality associated with CS remains unacceptably high [1, 2]. While very early mortality is largely related to sudden and severe circulatory failure, subsequent death is strongly influenced by activation of neurohumoral and inflammatory responses leading to multiorgan failure [3]. <b>Risk</b> <b>stratification</b> is crucial in order to accurately identify patients that could potentially benefit from more aggressive strategies, and moreover, to identify advanced stages of shock when restoring cardiac function may not reverse end-organ failure. The CardShock risk score was recently introduced to help <b>risk</b> <b>stratification</b> in the early phase of CS. The score includes lactate levels and six other clinical variables available at the time of detection of shock [2]. However, as based on baseline parameters, the score may not reflect the change in <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> in response to initial therapies.|$|R
