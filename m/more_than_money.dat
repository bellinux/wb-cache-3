Larger rates (e.g. a market rate of return) reflects humans' attraction to time inconsistency—valuing money that they receive today <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>money</b> {{they get in the}} future.

One issue is the equity premium puzzle, in which long-term returns on equities may be rather higher than they should be. If so then arguably market rates of return should not be used to determine a discount rate, as doing so would have the effect of undervaluing the distant future (e.g. climate change).|$|E
