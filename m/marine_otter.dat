5|$|An extinct genus, Satherium, is {{believed}} to be ancestral to the present species, having migrated to the New World during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The giant otter shares the South American continent with three of the four members of the New World Lontra genus of otters: the neotropical river otter, the southern river otter, and the <b>marine</b> <b>otter.</b> (The North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) is the fourth Lontra member.) The giant otter seems to have evolved independently of Lontra in South America, despite the overlap. The smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) of Asia may be its closest extant relative; similar behaviour, vocalizations, and skull morphology have been noted. Both species also show strong pair bonding and paternal engagement in rearing cubs.|$|E
500|$|The {{sea otter}} was {{formerly}} {{sometimes referred to}} as the [...] "sea beaver", being the marine fur-bearer similar in commercial value to the terrestrial beaver. [...] Rodents (of which the beaver is one) are not closely related to otters, which are carnivores. It is {{not to be confused with}} the <b>marine</b> <b>otter,</b> a rare otter species native to the southern west coast of South America. A number of other otter species, while predominantly living in fresh water, are commonly found in marine coastal habitats. The extinct sea mink of northeast North America is another mustelid that had adapted to a marine environment.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>marine</b> <b>otter</b> (Lontra felina) is a {{rare and}} poorly known South American mammal of the weasel family (Mustelidae). The {{scientific}} name means [...] "otter cat", and in Spanish, the <b>marine</b> <b>otter</b> is also {{often referred to as}} : [...] "marine cat". The <b>marine</b> <b>otter</b> (while spending much of its time out of the water) only lives in saltwater, coastal environments and rarely ventures into freshwater or estuarine habitats. This saltwater exclusivity is unlike most other otter species, including the almost fully aquatic sea otter (Enhydra lutris) of the northeast Pacific.|$|E
50|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>otters</b> {{are rare}} and are {{protected}} under Peruvian, Chilean, and Argentine law. In the past, they were extensively hunted both for their fur {{and due to}} perceived competition with fisheries. Hunting extirpated them from most of Argentina and the Falkland Islands. Poaching is still a problem, but one of unknown magnitude. It is unknown how many <b>marine</b> <b>otters</b> exist in the wild or what habitats should be preserved to encourage their recovery. <b>Marine</b> <b>otters</b> were listed under CITES Appendix I in 1976, and are listed as endangered by the U.S. Department of the Interior.|$|R
50|$|The <b>marine</b> <b>otter's</b> lower jaws contain eight {{pairs of}} teeth, {{and the upper}} jaws eight or nine pairs. The teeth are {{developed}} for slicing rather than crushing.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the diet of <b>marine</b> <b>otters,</b> but their primary prey is {{believed}} to be crab, shrimp, mollusks, and fish.They also eat many types of crustaceans.|$|R
50|$|The polar bear, {{southern}} sea otter, <b>marine</b> <b>otter,</b> {{all three}} species of manatees, and the dugong are also concurrently listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).|$|E
50|$|The park {{is one of}} {{the last}} refuges for the Chilean huemul. In this also can be found species such as Andean condor, <b>marine</b> <b>otter</b> and cormorant.|$|E
50|$|Some of the mammals {{reported}} in the area are: Molina's hog-nosed skunk, the lesser grison, the Sechuran fox, the <b>marine</b> <b>otter,</b> Pallas's long-tongued bat, and the montane guinea pig.|$|E
50|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>otters</b> {{are most}} often seen {{individually}} or in small groups of up to three. They are difficult to spot, swimming low in the water, exposing only their heads and backs. It is not known whether they are territorial, as males are occasionally seen fighting, yet fights have also been observed even between mating pairs. Fighting takes place on prominent rocks above the waterline, which are also used for resting, feeding, and grooming. <b>Marine</b> <b>otters</b> have also been observed feeding cooperatively on large fish, {{but it is not}} known how common the practice is.|$|R
50|$|Several {{species of}} birds find shelter in the park, {{including}} black-browed albatrosses, great grebes, black-necked swans and cormorants. The wildlife in this area also include Chilean dolphins, sea lions, <b>marine</b> <b>otters</b> and elephant seals.|$|R
50|$|Under the MMPA, the Service is {{responsible}} for ensuring the protection of sea <b>otters</b> and <b>marine</b> <b>otters,</b> walruses, polar bears, three species of manatees, and dugongs. NOAA was given responsibility to conserve and manage pinnipeds including seals and sea lions and cetaceans such as whales and dolphins.|$|R
50|$|Mammal species {{found in}} the park include: <b>marine</b> <b>otter</b> (Lontra felina, known locally as chungungo), leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), Chilean dolphin (Cephalorhynchus eutropia, {{also known as the}} black dolphin or tonina), Burmeister's {{porpoise}} (Phocoena spinipinnis), Peale's dolphin (Lagenorhynchus australis) and humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae).|$|E
50|$|The {{region has}} long been {{geographically}} isolated, making it a haven for endemic species. Some of the rare species that inhabit the Valdivian Coastal Range include the pudu (the smallest deer in the world), the common degu, the <b>marine</b> <b>otter,</b> and the monito del monte, or mountain monkey (actually a marsupial).|$|E
50|$|The guanaco is {{the main}} mammal found in the park. Other mammals include culpeo fox, chilla fox and European hare. The {{shoreline}} area is home to marine mammals, such as the <b>marine</b> <b>otter</b> and the South American sea lion. Among the birds are the Humboldt penguin and Peruvian pelican. Also reptile species of the genera Tropidurus and Callopistes inhabit the park.|$|E
50|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>otters</b> {{are found}} in {{littoral}} areas of southwestern South America, close to shore and in the intertidal areas of northern Peru (from the port of Chimbote), along the entire coast of Chile, and the extreme southern reaches of Argentina. Occasional vagrant sightings still occur as far afield as the Falkland Islands.|$|R
50|$|The northwestern of Chiloé Island in Chiloé National Park {{has a great}} {{diversity}} of marine fauna, including blue whale, sei whale, Chilean dolphins and Peale's dolphins; sea lions, <b>marine</b> <b>otters,</b> and Magellanic penguin and Humboldt penguins.Nevertheless, this relatively undisturbed area faces different threats, like urban development, habitat degradation, land and marine pollution.|$|R
50|$|The {{monument}} {{is notable}} {{for being the}} only known shared breeding site for Humboldt and Magellanic penguins. Also is reproduction area for other species, as are the red-legged cormorant and kelp gull. Other bird species residing in the area include kelp goose and Fuegian steamer duck. <b>Marine</b> <b>otters</b> find refuge in this protected area.|$|R
5000|$|Marine mammals: include whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, sea lions, walruses, sea otter, <b>marine</b> <b>otter,</b> manatees, dugong and {{the polar}} bear. Major threats include {{entanglement}} in ghost nets, targeted harvesting, noise pollution from military and seismic sonar, and boat strikes. Other threats are water pollution, habitat loss from coastal development, loss of food sources {{due to the}} collapse of fisheries, and climate change.|$|E
50|$|An extinct genus, Satherium, is {{believed}} to be ancestral to South American river otters, having migrated to the New World during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The South American continent houses the Lontra genus of otters: the giant otter, the neotropical river otter, the southern river otter, and the <b>marine</b> <b>otter.</b> The smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) of Asia may be its closest extant relative; similar behaviour, vocalizations, and skull morphology have been noted.|$|E
50|$|The <b>marine</b> <b>otter</b> mainly inhabits rocky shorelines with {{abundant}} seaweed and kelp, and infrequently visits estuaries and freshwater rivers. It {{appears to}} select habitats with surprisingly high exposure to strong swells and winds, {{unlike many other}} otters, which prefer calmer waters. Caves and crevices in the rocky shorelines may {{provide them with the}} cover they need, and often a holt will have no land access at high tide. Marine otters avoid sandy beaches.|$|E
50|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>otters</b> may be monogamous or polygamous, and {{breeding}} occurs in December or January. Litters {{of two to}} five pups are born in January, February or March after a gestation period of 60 to 70 days. The pups remain with their mother for about 10 months of parental care, and can sometimes {{be seen on the}} mother's belly as she swims on her back, a practice {{similar to that of the}} sea otter. Parents bring food to the pups and teach them to hunt.|$|R
40|$|Marine mammals arc often {{considered}} as a group by the general public, biologists, natural resource managers and legislators. Nonetheless, they comprise members of three very different orders of animals with different evolutionary histories. The Carnivora includes 36 extant and recently extinct species of seals, sealions and walruses (Rice 1998) {{as well as the}} polar bear and two species of <b>marine</b> <b>otters.</b> Systematists disagree about the exact number of species of the order Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises). Rice (1998) lists 83 species in two sub-orders: the Mysticeti (baleen whales) and Odontoceti (toothed whales). There are four extant species of Sirenia (manatees and dugongs). The gigantic Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) was hunted to extinction by sealers in the eighteenth cetury...|$|R
5|$|Otters are {{the only}} marine animals {{that are capable of}} lifting and turning over rocks, which they often do with their front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into {{underwater}} mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth. Under each foreleg, sea otters have a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest which they use to store collected food to bring to the surface. This pouch also holds a rock that is used to break open shellfish and clams, an example of tool use. The sea otters eat while floating on their backs, using their forepaws to tear food apart and bring to their mouths. <b>Marine</b> <b>otters</b> mainly feed on crustaceans and fish.|$|R
50|$|Mammals {{found in}} the park include the Culpeo or Andean fox (lycalopex culpaeus), the South American gray fox (lycalopex griseus), {{also known as the}} Patagonian fox, the <b>marine</b> <b>otter</b> (lontra felina), known locally as chungungo, the South American sea lion, the {{southern}} elephant seals, the leopard seal (hydrurga leptonyx), the Chilean dolphin (cephalorhynchus eutropia, also known as the black dolphin or tonina), the Burmeister's porpoise (phocoena spinipinnis), Peale's dolphin (lagenorhynchus australis), the humpback whale (megaptera novaeangliae), and the guanaco (lama guanicoe).|$|E
50|$|Applications {{for such}} permits are {{reviewed}} and issued the Service's Division of Management Authority, through the International Affairs office. This office also houses the Division of International Conservation, which is {{directly responsible for}} coordinating international activities for marine mammal species found in both U.S. and International waters, or are absent from U.S. waters. Marine mammal species inhabiting both U.S. and International waters include the West Indian manatee, sea otter, polar bear, and Pacific walrus. Species not present in U.S. waters include the West African and Amazonian manatee, dugong, Atlantic walrus, and <b>marine</b> <b>otter.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Marine otters are {{relatively}} small, and among otters, only the {{oriental small-clawed otter}} is smaller. However the latter species inhabits freshwater sites; thus the <b>marine</b> <b>otter</b> is the smallest exclusively marine mammal on Earth. Lengths range from 83 to 113 cm, not counting the tail of 30 to 36 cm. Weights can range from 3 to 5.8 kg. Their fur is dark brown {{on the back and}} light brown on belly. The guard hairs cover short insulating fur with a grayish color. The fur is coarser and tougher than in sea otters.|$|E
5|$|The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) {{was passed}} on October 21, 1972 under {{president}} Richard Nixon {{to prevent the}} further depletion and possible extinction of marine mammal stocks. It prohibits the taking ("the act of hunting, killing, capture, and/or harassment of any marine mammal; or, the attempt at such") of any marine mammal without a permit issued by the Secretary. Authority to manage the MMPA was divided between the Secretary of the Interior through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), and the Secretary of Commerce, which is delegated to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) was established to review existing policies and make recommendations to the Service and NOAA to better implement the MMPA. The Service is responsible for ensuring the protection of sea <b>otters</b> and <b>marine</b> <b>otters,</b> walruses, polar bears, the three species of manatees, and dugongs; and NOAA was given responsibility to conserve and manage pinnipeds (excluding walruses) and cetaceans.|$|R
5000|$|Guafo Island is {{characterized}} by a high biodiversity that includes the largest breeding colony of South American fur seals (Arctocephalus australis) on Chilean coasts, a large population of South American sea lions (Otaria byronia), and a reproductively active population of <b>marine</b> <b>otters</b> (Lontra felina), a critically endangered species. Recently the coasts of the island have been indicated as an important feeding area of blue whales (Balaenopteramusculus), Southern right whale (Eubalaena australis), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and transient killer whales (Orcinus orca). Among seabird highlights is the largest breeding colony of sooty shearwater (Puffinusgriseus) in the world (Reyes-Arriagada et al. 2007) as well as important nesting sites of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) and occasional sightings of Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti). Historical data also shows that the Island was within the itinerary of the Beagle in 1835. Guafo Island has been considered within areas that are critical for marine conservation by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) ...|$|R

50|$|Isla Chañaral (sometimes {{referred}} to as Isla Chanaral or Chanaral Island) is located 6 km off-shore from the northern Central Chilean coast, some 100 km {{north of the city}} of La Serena. Together with Isla Choros and Isla Damas, the island forms the Humboldt Penguin National Reserve, which is administered by the Chilean Forestry Corporation (CONAF). All three islands support populations of Humboldt penguins, but are also habitat for several other rare and endangered animal species such as the Peruvian diving petrel or the South American <b>marine</b> <b>otter.</b> In recent years the reserve has experienced a strong increase in tourist activities, mainly due to the presence of bottlenose dolphins that reside in the waters of the reserve. However, recently local fishermen reported increasing spells of dolphin absence which scientist believe might be connected to disturbance from these largely unregulated activities.|$|E
50|$|Large {{terrestrial}} mammal {{species in}} the park include wolf packs, porcupine, Canadian lynx, brown bear, black bears, Alaskan moose and mountain goat. Smaller mammals include coyote, beaver and river <b>otter.</b> <b>Marine</b> mammals include sea otter, harbor seal and Steller sea lion. Cetaceans seen in park waters include orca, fin whale, humpback whale, minke whales, Dall's porpoise and Pacific white-sided dolphin.|$|R
40|$|The sea otter, Enhydra lutris, is {{the largest}} member of the Mustelidae family {{and is the only}} one which lives entirely in <b>marine</b> waters. Sea <b>otters</b> are unique among marine mammals because, unlike whales, {{dolphins}} and seals, {{they do not have a}} layer of fat or blubber to keep them warm in the cool oceans of the North Pacific. Instead, sea otters depend on dense fur that traps tiny air bubbles to insulate them from the cold water. To stay warm, they also must maintain a very high metabolic rate, requiring the sea otter to eat about 25 % of its body weight per day. Sea otters eat mostly invertebrates — clams, crabs, urchins, and mussels — found in shallow coastal waters. Geographic Range and Species History The historical range of the sea otter includes the shallow coastal waters of the northern Pacific rim, from central Baja California to the islands of northern Japan. About 250 year...|$|R
40|$|The {{extirpation}} of otters in Canada {{was caused}} by commercial exploitation and with continued protection {{it is likely that}} the population will continue to increase. Suitable habitat appears to be plentiful and does not appear to have been reduced significantly in quantity or quality since historical times. Given the remoteness of much of this habitat it is unlikely that human activities pose much of a threat at the present time. One possible exception, however, is the presence of oil pollution. Unlike most <b>marine</b> mammals, sea <b>otters</b> rely upon their fur for insulation. This fur is highly sensitive to environmental contamination and oiling has been shown to significantly reduce its insulative properties This results in increased metabolic rates and can cause death. Considering the limited distribution of sea otters and the increased interest in offshore oil development and transportation along the British Columbian coast, this could pose a future threat. For now however, the future of sea otters in Canada appears bright...|$|R
