40|$|This {{dissertation}} first {{develops a}} theoretical framework to enable the estimation of cost efficiency and conduct parameter without total cost data. By validating this framework using U. S. airline data, this dissertation shows the feasibility of the theoretical framework. Based on the estimates of <b>marginal</b> cost <b>efficiency</b> and conduct parameter, this dissertation also finds some support for the Quiet Life Hypothesis. In Chapter III, this dissertation analyzes the determinants for price dispersion, especially conduct parameter and cost efficiency. Generally speaking, we find negative relationship between conduct parameter and price dispersion and negative relationship between <b>marginal</b> cost <b>efficiency</b> and price dispersion. In Chapter IV, this thesis examines the dynamics that lead to high price dispersion. To be more specific, this thesis concentrates on advanced days purchased and load factor. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{continuous}} increase in automotive electric power usage. Future projections show no sign of it decreasing. Therefore, the automotive industry has a need to either improve the current 12 Volt automotive electrical system or move to a higher voltage vehicle electric system. Both of these choices are likely to increase cost of the system. Performance improvements {{will be needed to}} justify the increased cost to the Original Equipment Manufacturer. This thesis is investigating the potential for fuel economy improvements and their associated economic advantages for different vehicle electric systems. The objective is to determine the effects on fuel consumption of electrical system choices under a variety of drive and load cycle circumstances. Incremental, or <b>marginal,</b> <b>efficiencies</b> will be used to determine the relationship between loads and fuel consumptions.

By reallocating between the last {{agreement and the}} first, the buyer can increase it’s share of the surplus.

Infrastructure investments differ in that they are often delivered or mediated by the state due to their characteristics as natural monopolies, difficulties of excludability/capturing of spillover benefits and their propensity to impose negative externalities on proximate citizens and ecosystems. This has led to infrastructure investments being assessed using Cost Benefit Analysis, wherein the “golden rule is that all benefits must be quantified” (HM Treasury, 2013 p. 51), usually by assigning monetary values to both tradable and non-tradable benefits and costs.|$|R
40|$|Although China is a {{very large}} and populous nation, and has one of the longest known {{histories}} in the world, it has only lately begun to seek its place among modern industrial nations. This move, precipitated by the government`s relatively recently adopted strategic goals of economic development, societal reform and promotion of engagement with other industrial nations, has brought to the fore the serious situation in which the Chinese electric power industry finds itself. Owing to the advanced average age of generation facilities and the technology used in them, serious expansion and modernization of this industry needs to take place, and soon, if it is to support the rapid industrial development already taking place in China. While China does have some oil and gas, coal constitutes its largest indigenous energy supply, by far. Coal has been mined and utilized for years in China. It is used directly to provide heat for homes, businesses and in industrial applications, and used to raise steam for the generation of electricity. The presently dominant coal utilization methods are characterized by low or <b>marginal</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and an almost universal lack of pollution control equipment. Because there is so much of it, coal is destined to be China`s predominant source of thermal energy for decades to come. Realizing these things [...] the rapidly increasing demand for more electric power than China presently can produce, the need to raise coal utilization efficiencies, and the corresponding need to preserve the environment [...] the Chinese government moved to commission several official working organizations to tackle these problems...|$|R

50|$|Asimakopulos (1971, 1991), Piero Garegnani (1978) {{and several}} Post Keynesians offered a {{troublesome}} critique to Keynes' original formulation. Asimakopulos et al. questioned the very {{possibility of a}} downward-sloping <b>Marginal</b> <b>Efficiency</b> of Investment (MEI) function {{in the presence of}} unemployment. In particular, we can note that Keynes's multiplier story implies that if investment is undertaken then, by the multiplier, aggregate demand and output rises. But if the <b>marginal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of investment function is dependent on expected future returns, then should not the increased income and thus aggregate demand from the multiplier imply higher future returns? If so, then the MEI function ought to shift outwards to the right. This, in turn, implies that investment ought to increase which leads to another increase in aggregate demand and thus the MEI curve shifts out again, raising investment, etc.|$|E

Much of this esoteric terminology was invented by Keynes especially for his General Theory. Keynes argued that if savings were being withheld from investment in financial markets, total spending falls, leading to reduced incomes and unemployment, which reduces savings again. This continues until the desire to save becomes equal to the desire to invest, which means a new [...] "equilibrium" [...] is reached and the spending decline halts.

By indexes of Lordkipanidze law of economic competition, the less are output of monopoly and excess (disquality or needless) production (or services), the more is the force of competition. R. Lordkipanidze defines two constituents of force (I0 and I1) and their integral influence (K): I0 = U/R0 I1 = U/R1; K= N × I0× I1, where U is total production; R0 - non-realized production; R1 - output of the largest firm (maybe monopoly); N - number of firms.
