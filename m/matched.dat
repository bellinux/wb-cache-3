5|$|Finally, {{after the}} {{workshop}} concluded, an 1884 {{edition of the}} Cyrus Cylinder by E. A. Wallis Budge came to Irving Finkel's attention.

5|$|Police {{investigators}} under Captain Michael Schaack had a lead fragment {{removed from}} a policeman's wounds chemically analyzed.

5|$|The age of {{the bones}} at death <b>matched</b> that of Richard when he was killed; they were dated to about the period of his death and were mostly {{consistent}} with physical descriptions of the king.

Taking these findings into account along with other historical, scientific and archaeological evidence, the University of Leicester announced on 4 February 2013 that it had concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the skeleton was that of Richard III.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} a linear relaxation of the matroid <b>matching</b> problem, called the fractional matroid <b>matching</b> problem. When the matroid <b>matching</b> problem {{is in fact}} a matroid intersection problem, the fractional matroid <b>matching</b> polytope and the matroid <b>matching</b> polytope coincide. When the matroid <b>matching</b> problem {{is in fact a}} <b>matching</b> problem in a graph, the fractional matroid <b>matching</b> polytope and the classic fractional <b>matching</b> polytope of the graph coincide. Thus, the fractional matroid <b>matching</b> polytope may properly contain the matroid <b>matching</b> polytope. The fractional matroid <b>matching</b> polytope is a lattice polyhedron and, although its extreme points are not all integral, they are half-integral. This paper establishes strong relationships between extreme points of the fractional matroid <b>matching</b> polytope and those of graphic fractional <b>matching</b> polyhedra. Despite these strong relationships, adding the rank 1 inequalities does not define the matroid <b>matching</b> polytope. In fact, even the <b>matching</b> polytope of a graphic matroid is not generally described by adding these inequalities...|$|R
