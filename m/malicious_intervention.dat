50|$|Within {{and outside}} elections, use of {{computers}} for decision support comes with certain IT risks. In even those jurisdictions where vote-tabulating computers do not have active wireless communications, Election-Day electronic miscounts {{can be caused by}} unintentional human error, such as incorrectly setting up the computers to read the unique ballot in each election; undetected malfunction, such as overheating or loss of calibration; or by <b>malicious</b> <b>intervention</b> by either corrupt insiders or external hackers who accessed the software before Election Day.|$|E
50|$|Hal Jordan {{defies the}} Guardians {{by working with}} their enemies to corral {{powerful}} entities. Stel {{is part of a}} Green Lantern force sent to arrest Hal. He works with Salakk, B'dg (Sector 1014), Turytt (Sector 786), Norchavius (Sector 26), Meadlux (Sector 1776) and Bareer's sector partner Lok Neboora. Hal attempts to recruit them to aid in his quest and Stel argues for the group to listen. At that moment, <b>malicious</b> <b>intervention</b> with the Green Lantern power battery causes the group to go mad and attempt to kill Hal. This situation erupts into the War of the Green Lanterns.|$|E
40|$|With {{the growing}} {{influence}} of e-Science, substantial quantities of research are being facilitated, recorded, and reported {{by means of}} distributed computing. As a result, the scope for <b>malicious</b> <b>intervention</b> continues to grow, {{and so do the}} rewards available to those able to steal the models and data that have significant commercial value. Researchers are often reluctant to exploit the full benefits of distributed computing because they fear the compromise of their sensitive data or the uncertainty of the returned results. In this chapter, we propose two types of trustworthy distributed systems – one suitable for a computational system and the other for a distributed data system. Central to these systems is the novel idea of configuration resolver, which, in both designs, is responsible for filtering trustworthy hosts and ensuring that jobs are dispatched to those considered trustworthy. Furthermore, the blind analysis server enables statistical analyses to be performed on sensitive raw data – collected from multiple sites – without disclosing it to anyone...|$|E
30|$|A {{key problem}} on using crowdsourced data for {{scientific}} purposes is that you cannot rely {{on the quality of}} the data input. Sometimes due to unvoluntary mistakes made by the volunteers and sometimes due to <b>malicious</b> <b>interventions.</b> Some mechanisms are enabled to verify and validate the data. On COBWEB, part of this quality assurance is done by automatic filters on the data collected, based on known statistic distributions. Outliers are discarded, but even then, specific domain filters are needed for each usecase, even requiring manual intervention on not clear data. Asking different participants to collect the same data on similar time and location also help improving the quality assurance.|$|R
40|$|The Internet {{provides}} very economical real-time {{communications between}} computers and delivers services/products almost instantly to the users. The sensitive data transmitted {{through the internet}} must be secured as it is growingly susceptible to security related problems such as eavesdropping, <b>malicious</b> <b>interventions</b> etc. The steganography is an alternative to cryptographic techniques for secured transmission of data over the internet, where the secret message is hidden in some other innocuous communication so that only the rightful recipient can able to detect {{the presence of the}} secret message and extract it. Recently, many data embedding schemes have been proposed for achieving the robustness of this technique. However, most of the schemes lack to strike a tradeoff between the embedding capacity and the visual quality. In this paper, we have proposed a new method for hiding messages in a color image in the spatial domain based on chaos theory, which uses chaotic maps to embed data. This method is robust as well as has the higher payload capacity and compression resistant...|$|R
40|$|With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} use of computers for critical systems, computer security, the protection {{of data and computer}} systems from intentional, <b>malicious</b> <b>intervention,</b> is attracting much attention. Among the methods for defence, intrusion detection, i. e. the application of a tool to help the operator identify ongoing or already perpetrated attacks {{has been the subject of}} considerable research in the past ten years. A key problem with current intrusion detection systems is the high number of false alarms they produce. This thesis presents research into why false alarms are and will remain a problem and proposes to apply results from the field of information visualisation to the problem of intrusion detection. This was thought to enable the operator to correctly identify false (and true) alarms, and also aid the operator in identifying other operational characteristics of intrusion detection systems. Four different visualisation approaches were tried, mainly on data from web server access logs. Two direct approaches were tried; where the system puts the onus of identifying the malicious access requests on the operator by way of the visualisation. Two indirect approaches were also tried; where the state of two self learning automated intrusion detection systems were visualised to enable the operator to examine their inner workings. This with the hope that in doing so, the operator would gain an understanding of how the intrusion detections systems operated and whether that level of operation, and the quality of the output, was satisfactory. Several experiments were performed and many different attacks in web access data from publicly available web servers were found. The visualisation helped the operator either detect the attacks herself and more importantly the false alarms. It also helped her determine whether other aspects of the operation of the self learning intrusion detection systems were satisfactory...|$|E
