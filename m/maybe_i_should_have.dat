500|$|The {{top three}} drivers in both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Although Bird spoke of his satisfaction of controlling {{the pace of the}} feature race, he believed he was fortunate because of him receiving a new rear wing after being impacted by Ceccon at the first start, [...] "It’s an amazing to be able to win my first GP2 race in Monaco. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done it already in the past in GP2, but it felt pretty right today." [...] Ceccon stated he was [...] "happy" [...] to secure second place and praised his team for his strategy that enabled him to move ahead of Evans, [...] " [...] It’s my first GP2 podium and it’s {{two years in a row}} that I finish on the podium here since I finished third last year in GP3 here as well. Today, I finished in P2 in race 1. It’s good." [...] When asked if he was disappointed over his third place finish, Evans replied yes as he struggled with grip on his supersoft compound tyres at the restart and was being pressured by Bird on the harder soft compound tyres. Evans believed that had he overtaken Ceccon he could have had similar pace levels to Bird and felt the best possible result he could have achieved was second but stated he would accept the result.|$|E

500|$|Vulović {{told reporters}} {{that she did not}} think of her fall every day, but {{admitted}} to struggling with survivor's guilt. [...] "Whenever I think of the accident, I have a prevailing, grave feeling of guilt for surviving it and I cry... Then <b>I</b> think <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> survived at all." [...] Vulović declined therapy to help her cope with her experiences and instead turned to religion, becoming a devout Orthodox Christian. She stated that her ordeal had turned her into an optimist. [...] "If you can survive what I survived," [...] she said, [...] "you can survive anything." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Hawking {{announced}} that he was conceding the bet, and that he now believed that black hole horizons should fluctuate and leak information, in doing so providing Preskill with a copy of Total Baseball, The Ultimate Baseball Encyclopedia. [...] Comparing the useless information obtainable from a black hole to [...] "burning an encyclopedia", Hawking later joked, [...] "I gave John an encyclopedia of baseball, but <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> just <b>have</b> given him the ashes." [...] Thorne, however, remained unconvinced of Hawking's proof and declined to contribute to the award. As of 2008, Hawking's argument that he has solved the paradox has not yet been accepted by the community, and a consensus has not yet been reached that Hawking has provided a strong enough argument that this is in fact what happens.|$|R
50|$|Funny thing is, Epitaph, who's under {{pressure}} here, didn't {{have anything to}} do with making the video at all. The only money spent on this video came out of my pocket—I'd been saving up checks from art jobs just to shoot this second video for our new record—one that there was no budget for in our recording contract, but that I was passionate about, and knew that people would be tickled to see. Epitaph didn't even know we were making a video! When we brought back the footage, they were thrilled, and then totally got behind us—helping us get great online coverage, and hopefully TV as well. Having them behind us gets our video and song much more potential coverage. <b>Maybe</b> instead <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> just slipped the thing online right when we finished it. Forgone the pomp and circumstance and just had the parade, tho be it smaller, before the red tape and roadblocks went up.|$|R

5000|$|Rafferty enjoyed alcohol {{from a young}} age, {{and early}} songs, such as [...] "One Drink Down", [...] "Baker Street", and [...] "Night Owl", freely mention the subject. According to Michael Gray, the singer's {{personal}} manager in the early 1980s: [...] "It {{never occurred to me}} in all the time I knew him that he was heading for alcoholism. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> realised, but I didn't. I'm unsure whether he did." [...] As the 1980s progressed, Rafferty's growing drinking problem placed his marriage under impossible strain and his wife divorced him in 1990, though they remained close. In 1995, Rafferty was deeply affected by the death of his older brother Joseph, an event from which family and friends said he never fully recovered.|$|E
5000|$|KatieJane is filmed {{through a}} window for 'In the Kitchen'. She does not face the camera {{and appears to be}} at a sink that we never see. Following the pattern, this last film is the {{shortest}} - lasting only 1 minute, 16 seconds. There is no music on this film, just a monologue from KatieJane echoing sentences such as [...] "I thought <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done it/ I could have gone anywhere/ I could step sideways right now/ Shall I do that right now?/ What do you think?/ God will show me a sign/ I'll wait 'til I see a sign". Here KatieJane questions herself elaborately, and it seems as though she is talking about herself in that very moment because she almost has her back fully to the camera. KatieJane doesn't move from her position throughout the video which is a clear contrast between the previous three episodes where she moves and dances, exposed to the camera.|$|E
5000|$|Andy {{said in an}} {{interview}} at the Download Festival that [...] "We've got three songs tracked. We've set ourselves a deadline of the end of August to finish it. We've got 20 to 25 songs written and we're narrowing it down now. John Feldmann is producing it. It's going {{to be more of a}} punk rock record than anything we've done before. It's Social Distortion meets Metallica." [...] Based on this statement, many people were led to believe that the record would literally be a punk rock album, but Biersack clarified his statement in {{an interview}} with Artisan News, stating [...] "The intention was never to make a punk rock record. I think that... <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> chosen my words better when I said that. The intention was to play on our influences a lot more and really go back to basics with how we wrote songs and focusing sic on the more punk rock ethic and the things that we felt early on when we were making our own merchandise; touring in a car with, you know, all of us sitting on top of each other in a U-haul trailer; and, you know, playing in clubs on soap, like, sic little soapboxes and stuff...

5000|$|Romanian {{university}} students were disproportionately over-represented in the Iron Guard, a fact which rebuts {{the claim that}} the Iron Guard attracted support only from social [...] "losers". Romania had a very large intelligentsia relative to its share of the population with 2.0 {{university students}} per one thousand of the population compared to 1.7 per one thousand of the population in far wealthier Germany, while Bucharest had more lawyers in the 1930s than did the much larger city of Paris. Even before the Great Depression, Romania's universities were turning out far more graduates than there were jobs for, and a mood of rage, desperation and frustration prevailed on campuses as it was apparent to most Romanian students that the middle class jobs that they were hoping for after graduation did not exist. In interwar Romania, Jews played much the same role as Greeks and Armenians did in the Ottoman Empire and the ethnic Chinese minorities do in modern Malaysia and Indonesia, namely a commercially successful minority much resented for their success. The Legion's call to end the [...] "Jewish colonization" [...] of Romania by expelling all the Jews, whom the Legion claimed were all illegal immigrants from Poland, and confiscate their assets so that Christian Romanians could rise up to the middle class, was very attractive to many university students. Codreanu's call for a Romania without individualism, where all Romanians would be spiritually united together as one, greatly appealed to the young people who believed that when Codreanu created his [...] "new man" [...] (omul nou), it would be the moment that an utopian society would come into existence. Ionesco felt that the way in which so many of his generation, especially university students, had abandoned the French ideas about universal human rights in favor of the death cult of the Legion, was a [...] "betrayal" [...] both personally and in a wider political sense of the sort of society Romania should be. As a young writer and playwright in 1930s Bucharest who associated with many leading figures of the intelligentsia, Ionesco felt more and more out of place as he clung to his humanist values while his friends all joined the Legion, feeling much as Bérenger does by the end of Rhinoceros as literally the last human being left on an earth overrun by rhinoceroses. In an interview with a Romanian newspaper shortly before his death in 1994, Ionesco stated how Rhinoceros related to his youth in Romania: [...] "It is true. I had the experience of an extrême droite. And of the second hand left, which had been a radical socialist...Maybe I should had belonged to the left for a while, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been of the left before being-not of the right-of the non-left, an enemy of the left. But at a certain moment, the left was no longer the left, at a certain moment the left become a right of horror, a right of terror and that's what I was denouncing, the terror".|$|E

As Beth pointed out, “I don’t {{want to give them}} too many ideas so that they do it all the same way, but at the same time, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done something so they think about, maybe how a greenhouse works.” Similarly, Walter regretted showing his students an example of a solar oven because they modeled their own designs after it and did not necessarily understand the science content that went into their designs.|$|E

5000|$|She had a multi-episode guest role on The Office from 2005 to 2006. Prior {{to leaving}} Dr. Vegas, she had {{received}} the script for the low-budget independent film Junebug and auditioned {{for the role of}} Ashley Johnsten, a young, cheerful and talkative pregnant woman. Director Phil Morrison explains his decision to cast Adams: [...] "Lots of people looked at Ashley and thought, 'What's the sorrow she's masking?' To me, the fact that Amy didn't approach it from the angle of 'What's she covering up?' was key." [...] The film was shot in 21 days in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. During that time, Adams turned 30 and was worried about her film career: [...] "I thought <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> move to New York, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> do something else. It wasn't that I was quitting or making a dramatic statement. It was more like maybe this just wasn't a good fit." [...] On the experience of making Junebug, Adams said, [...] "It was really empowering. At the end of the summer, I was unemployed but I was happy and I was proud. I was like, you know what, I'm done with being pushed around." [...] Junebug premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival with Adams winning a Special Jury Prize for her performance.|$|R

To remedy this it was suggested that <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> write 'country and western', <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> change my hair, maybe wear black leather.
