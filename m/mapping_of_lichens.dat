40|$|A {{biennial}} integrated survey, {{based on}} the use of vascular plants for the bioindication of the effects of tropospheric ozone together with the use of automatic analysers of ozone, as well as the <b>mapping</b> <b>of</b> <b>lichen</b> biodiversity was performed in the area of Castelfiorentino (Tuscany, central Italy). Photochemically produced ozone proved to be a fundamental presence during the warm season, with maximum hourly means reaching 114 ppb, exceeding the information threshold as fixed by EU: the use of supersensitive tobacco Bel-W 3 confirmed the opportunity of carrying out detailed cost-effective monitoring surveys. The potential for didactical and educational implications of this methodology are appealing. Critical levels set up for the protection of vegetation have exceeded considerably. The comparison of biomass productivity in sensitive and resistant individuals (NC-S and NC-R white clover clones, in the framework of an European network) provided evidence that ambient ozone levels are associated with relevant reduction (up to 30 %) in the performance of sensitive material; effects on flowering were also pronounced. The economic assessment of such an impact deserves attention. <b>Mapping</b> <b>of</b> epiphytic <b>lichen</b> biodiversity – which has been used to monitor air quality worldwide – was not related to ozone geographical distribution as depicted by tobacco response...|$|R
40|$|For the {{assessment}} of traffic-originated pollutants input into the environmentand their impact on biocenosis, the passive bioindication was used at eight selected road sections, where <b>mapping</b> <b>of</b> epiphytic <b>lichen</b> flora was implemented according to a German (VDI) method. The <b>mapping</b> <b>of</b> epiphytic <b>lichens</b> implies that lichens {{can be used in}} bioindication studies along roads; indeed, at locations with higher traffic density (average daily traffic > 20, 000) fewer lichen species were identified in comparison with locations with lower traffic density. At road sections with very high traffic density only epiphytic lichen species most resistant to pollution were recorded, while less resistant but still highly tolerant to nitrogen pollution lichen species were recorded at road sections with moderate traffic density (average daily traffic around 10, 000). At those road sections, the lichen species more sensitive to air pollution also begin to occur, which were not recorded at road sections with very high traffic density, not even 100 m away from the roadside...|$|R
40|$|For the {{assessment}} of air quality at locations along selected road sections with different traffic density, epiphytic lichens were used as passive reactive bioindicators. With the mapping at different distances from the roadside at each location, the trafficrelated pollution impact area was assessed. Two different mapping methods were used, specifically the simple assessment of air quality, based on {{the assessment}} of frequency and coverage <b>of</b> different <b>lichen</b> growth forms (the SI method), and more demanding one, based on <b>mapping</b> <b>of</b> <b>lichen</b> species (the VDI method). We conclude that at locations with moderate traffic density (average daily traffic < 20, 000) the traffic-related emissions have an influence on air quality as well, except that the impact {{is limited to a}} narrow zone along the roads (< 100 m). The epiphytic lichen species composition, the number <b>of</b> different <b>lichen</b> species, as well as calculated indexes of air purity according to two different methods indicate influence of traffic-pollution in the first mapping zone (adjacent to roads), with the impact level decreasing with the distance from the roads...|$|R

40|$|Mercury (Hg) poses {{environmental}} and health risks {{due to its}} global distribution and high toxicity exhibited in some of its chemical forms. Although Hg is naturally present in the environment, human activities have increased its cycling among the land, atmosphere and ocean {{by a factor of}} three to five comparing the pre-industrial period to the present day. The Torviscosa chlor-alkali plant (CAP), which operated since the beginning of twentieth century, {{was one of the most}} important Cl 2 production capacity in the Northern Italy and was responsible for an uncontrolled discharge of Hg in the surrounding area. Previous studies reported the high degree of Hg pollution in soils, river sediments and surface waters of the area, but the Hg level in the atmospheric media was never taken into consideration. In this work, an integrated approach was applied with the aim to assess the level, distribution and dispersion of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) close to the CAP area. GEM levels were monitored by means of four surveys conducted from September 2014 to July 2015, at fixed locations and covering an area of about 10 km 2 (including CAP area, Torviscosa village and reclaimed land), accomplished to Hg bioaccumulation measurements in selected lichens. The results indicate that the CAP area currently represents the main source of GEM in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region. The highest levels were found close to the old factory’s buildings (more than 5000 ng m− 3), whereas other sites are less impacted. The emission of GEM is not clearly related to the intensity of solar radiation (temperature) at the soil level; however, this latter influences the release from the old buildings employed in the past for the production activities. The most important factor driving the GEM dispersion is the wind, as confirmed by the <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>lichens</b> bioaccumulation. In this context, the GEM plume partially affects the nearby village of Torviscosa (about 1 km), but the values found were always well below the international thresholds for residential areas, thus excluding the risk of inhalation for local inhabitants...|$|R

The key objective is to <b>map</b> the diversity <b>of</b> <b>lichen</b> photobionts <b>of</b> the genus Stereocaulon, which has been insufficiently examined in comparison with related lichens Cladonia and Lepraria. In total, 92 samples belonging to 12 species of genus Stereocaulon were examined, being found in four continents, at the altitude of 50 to 2 900 metres a. s. l., and variety of natural and artificial substrata. Phylogenetic analyses were inferred on the basis of ITS rDNA, actin type I, 18 S rDNA and rbcL sequences. Photobionts belonging to two unrelated genera within Trebouxiophyceae, Asterochloris and Chloroidium, were found in thalli <b>of</b> Stereocaulon <b>lichens.</b> While Asterochloris represents one of the most frequent photobionts <b>of</b> various <b>lichens,</b> Chloroidium has been until now recorded as a lichen photobiont very rarely. The content of heavy metals in substratum can be considered as a determinative factor for its occurrence. A new lineage affiliated to genus Asterochloris was discovered on the island La Palma (the Canary Islands).

40|$|A {{biennial}} integrated survey, {{based on}} the use of vascular plants for the bioindication of the effects of tropospheric ozone, was performed in the area of Pisa (Tuscany, Central Italy). It also investigated the distribution of selected trace elements in plants and the data were compared with those obtained from the use of passive samplers, automatic analysers <b>of</b> ozone and <b>lichen</b> biodiversity. Photochemically produced ozone proved to be present during the warm season, with maximum hourly means surpassing 100 ppb: the use of supersensitive tobacco Bel-W 3 confirmed the value of detailed, cost-effective, monitoring surveys. Trials with clover clones demonstrate that sensitive plants undergo severe biomass reduction in the current ozone regime. The mean NC-S (clover clone sensitive to ozone) :NC-R (resistant) biomass ratio ranged from 0. 7 (in 1999) to 0. 5 (in 2000). The economic impact of these reductions deserves attention. The data obtained using passive ozone samplers exceeded those obtained using an automatic analyser.

40|$|On the Antarctic Peninsula, lichens are {{the most}} diverse botanical {{component}} of the terrestrial ecosystem. However, detailed information on the distribution <b>of</b> <b>lichens</b> on the Antarctic Peninsula region is scarce, and the data available exhibit significant heterogeneity in sampling frequency and effort.

40|$|Biological Soil Crusts (BSCs), {{composed}} <b>of</b> <b>lichens,</b> mosses, green algae, microfungi and cyanobacteria are {{an ecological}} {{important part of}} the perennial landcover of many arid and semiarid regions (Belnap et al. 2001 a), (Büdel 2002). In many arid and hyperarid areas BSCs form the only perennial "vegetation cover" largely due to their extensive resistance to drought (Lange et al. 1975). For the Central Namib Desert (Namibia), BSCs consisting <b>of</b> extraordinary vast <b>lichen</b> communities were recently mapped and classified into six morphological classes for a coastal area of 350 km x 60 km. Embedded into the project "BIOTA" (www. biota-africa. org) financed by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research the study was undertaken in the framework of the PhD thesis by Christoph Schultz. Some <b>of</b> these <b>lichen</b> communities grouped together in so called "lichen fields" have already been studied concerning their ecology and diversity in the past (Lange et al. 1994), (Loris & Schieferstein 1992), (Loris et al. 2004), (Ullmann & Büdel 2001 a), (Wessels 1989). Multispectral LANDSAT 7 ETM+ and LANDSAT 5 TM satellite imagery was utilized for an unitemporal supervised classification {{as well as for the}} establishment of a monitoring based on a combined retrospective supervised classification and change detection approach (Bock 2003), (Weiers et al. 2003). Results comprise the analysis <b>of</b> the <b>mapped</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>lichen</b> communities for the Central Namib Desert as of 2003 as well as reconstructed distributions for the years 2000, 1999, 1992 and 1991 derived from retrospective supervised classification. This allows a first monitoring of the disturbance, destruction and recovery <b>of</b> the <b>lichen</b> communities in these arid environments including the analysis of the major abiotic processes involved. Further analysis of these abiotic processes is key for understanding the influence <b>of</b> Namib <b>lichen</b> communities on overall aeolian and water induced erosion rates, nutrient cycles, water balance and pedogenic processes (Belnap & Gillette 1998), (Belnap et al. 2001 b), (Belnap 2001 c), (Evans & Lange 2001), (McKenna Neumann & Maxwell 1999). In order to aid the understanding of these processes SRTM digital elevation model data as well as climate data sets were used as reference. Good correlation between geomorphological form elements as well as hydrological drainage system and the disturbance patterns derived from individual post classification change comparisons between the timeframes could be observed. Conjoined with the climate data sets sporadic foehn-like windstorms as well as extraordinary precipitation events were identified to largely affect the distribution patterns <b>of</b> <b>lichen</b> communities. Therefore the analysis and monitoring of the diversity, distribution and spatiotemporal change of Central Namib BSCs with the means of Remote Sensing and GIS applications proof to be important tools to create further understanding of desertification and degradation processes in these arid regions.

40|$|Arctic environments {{provide a}} {{challenging}} ground for geological mapping and mineral exploration. Inaccessibility complicates ground surveys {{and the presence}} of ice, vegetation, and lichens hinders supportive remote sensing surveys. Spectral mixing <b>of</b> <b>lichens</b> and bare rock can shift the wavelength position of characteristic absorption features, thereby complicating the spectral <b>mapping</b> <b>of</b> minerals and lithologies. The extent to which diagnostic rock features are preserved despite the presence <b>of</b> <b>lichens</b> is <b>of</b> major concern in remotely sensed geological studies and estimates of the critical level <b>of</b> <b>lichen</b> coverage, below which spectral features of the mineral substrate can still be identified, are needed.
