40|$|Abstract—Address auto-configuration is a {{key problem}} in data center networks, where servers and {{switches}} encode topology information into their addresses for routing. A recent work DAC [2] has been introduced to address this problem. Without <b>malfunctions,</b> DAC can auto-configure all the devices quickly. But in case of <b>malfunctions,</b> DAC requires significant human efforts to correct <b>malfunctions</b> and it can cause substantial operation delay of the whole data center. In this paper, we further optimize address auto-configuration process even {{in the presence of}} <b>malfunctions.</b> Instead of waiting for all the <b>malfunctions</b> to be corrected, we could first configure the devices that are not involved in <b>malfunctions</b> and let them work first. This idea can be translated to considerable practical benefits because in most cases <b>malfunctions</b> in data centers only account for a very small portion. To realize the idea, we conceptually remove the <b>malfunctions</b> from the physical data center topology graph and mathematically convert the address configuration problem into induced subgraph isomorphism problem, which is NP-complete. We then introduce an algorithm that can solve the induced subgraph isomorphism quickly by taking advantage of data center topology characteristics and induced subgraph properties. We extensively evaluate our design on representative data center structures with various <b>malfunction</b> scenarios. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed framework and algorithm are efficient and labor-free to deal with the mapping task in the presence of error devices...|$|R
