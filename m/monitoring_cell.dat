40|$|A {{method to}} {{quantify}} spectral {{effects on the}} electric parameters of multi-junction solar cells is presented. The method is based on measuring the short circuit current {{of at least two}} <b>monitor</b> <b>cells.</b> Ideally these <b>monitor</b> <b>cells</b> have the same spectral responses as the subcells in the investigated multi-junction solar cell. In contrast to the subcells, the current of the individual <b>monitor</b> <b>cells</b> can be measured separately. This allows conclusions to be drawn about the spectral impact on the current mismatch of the multi-junction solar cell. A spectrometric evaluation method is then applied. The method has been tested experimentally with three concentrator modules using III-V triple-junction solar cells. These modules were measured outdoors for several months under variable solar spectral conditions. In parallel, the IV curves of the modules and the current of two component cells were measured. A spectral parameter Z was derived from the <b>monitor</b> <b>cell</b> current signals, which was correlated to the short circuit current and the fill factor of the modules. A linear correlation was found between Z and the normalized short circuit Current of the concentrator modules. Translation equations were derived from the linear correlation. These enable the calculation of a module's short circuit current under any spectral conditions. In particular, the short circuit currents of the modules were derived for direct normal irradiance of 850 W/m(2) and spectral conditions corresponding to the AM 1. 5 d low AOD spectrum. This is an important step towards comparing the performance of modules which show strong spectral sensitivity. Future rating methods can benefit from the presented simple method for quantifying spectral impacts oil multi-junction solar cells. Furthermore. the method can be of interest for tuning the spectrum of pulsed solar simulators...|$|R

5000|$|The Ministry of Home Affairsâ Anti-Trafficking <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Cell</b> {{reportedly}} {{collected data}} on trafficking arrests, prosecutions, and rescues, and coordinated and analyzed local-level information from regional anti-trafficking units. During the year, {{there was some}} evidence of official complicity in human trafficking. Several NGOs reported a nexus among members of parliament and corrupt recruiting agencies and village level brokers and indicated that politicians and regional gangs were involved in human trafficking. Some NGOs also report that official recruitment agencies in Dhaka have linkages with employers in destination countries who sometimes put their migrant workers in situations of servitude. Low-level government employees were also complicit in trafficking. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the government prosecuted a civil servant who was complicit in trafficking; the trial remained ongoing {{at the end of}} the reporting period. The government confirmed the existence of allegations against some Bangladeshi soldiers in Sierra Leone who may have engaged in or facilitated trafficking, but the government did not provide any information on investigations or prosecutions of these cases. The countryâs National Police Academy (Bangladesh)|National Police Academy provided anti-trafficking training to 2,876 police officers in 2009. The 12 police officers of the Ministry of Home Affairsâ [...] "Trafficking in Human Beings Investigation Unit" [...] continued to receive training on investigation techniques. Other government officials received training from NGOs, international organizations, and foreign governments.

50|$|PreventionThe Bangladeshi {{government}} {{failed to}} take adequate efforts to prevent the forced labor of Bangladeshis abroad and at home, and made modest efforts to prevent sex trafficking over the reporting period. During the reporting period, the BMET reportedly shut down one recruiting agency, cancelled the licenses and confiscated the security deposit money of six agencies for their involvement in fraudulent recruitment practices that potentially facilitated human trafficking. This is a decrease from the nine agencies shut down and 25 agencies whose licenses were cancelled in the previous reporting period. BMET collected approximately $830,000 in fines from recruitment agencies for fraudulent recruitment practices and other infractions. The government continued to allow BAIRA to set fees, license individual agencies, certify workers for overseas labor, and handle most complaints of expatriate laborers, while not exercising adequate oversight over this consortium of labor recruiters to ensure their practices do not facilitate debt bondage of Bangladeshi workers abroad. Various ministries disseminated numerous anti-sex trafficking messages in forums including public service announcements, discussions, songs, rallies, and posters. The <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Cell</b> reported anti-sex trafficking messaging was included in monthly public outreach sessions conducted by government heads in each of Bangladeshâs 65 units. The Home Secretary continued to chair the monthly inter-ministerial National Anti- Trafficking Committee Meetings, which oversees district-level committees in 64 districts. The Home Secretary also regularly holds coordination committee meetings with NGOs, although some NGOs note that the meetings often have broad agendas and do not focus adequately on trafficking. The Ministry of Home Affairs published the Bangladesh Country Report on Combating Trafficking in Women and Children. While the government made the registration compulsory in 2006, the national rate of birth registration is only between seven and 10 percent, and most children born {{in the rural areas}} are still not properly documented. During the year, the government did not demonstrate measures to reduce the demand for forced labor or for commercial sex acts. Bangladesh is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.|$|E
