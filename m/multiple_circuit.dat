Since our methods take into account <b>multiple</b> <b>circuit</b> transformations during routing phase where the accurate physical information is available, we can obtain better results than the conventional routing tools. In addition, we can succeed in routing even if other routers like rip-up and reroute methods fail.

5000|$|With {{virtual circuit}} multiplexing, the {{communicating}} hosts agree to send only one packets {{belonging to a}} single high-level protocol on any given ATM virtual <b>circuit,</b> and <b>multiple</b> virtual <b>circuits</b> {{may need to be}} set up. It has the advantage of not requiring additional protocol-identifying information in a packet, which minimizes the overhead. For example, if the hosts agree to transfer IP, a sender can pass each datagram directly to AAL5 to transfer, nothing needs to be sent besides the datagram and the AAL5 trailer. This reduction in overhead tends to further improve efficiency (e.g., an IPv4 datagram containing a TCP ACK-only packet with neither IP nor TCP options exactly fits into a single ATM cell). The chief disadvantage of such a scheme lies in duplication of virtual circuits: a host must create a separate virtual circuit for each high-level protocol if more than one protocol is used. Because most carriers charge for each virtual circuit, customers try to avoid using <b>multiple</b> <b>circuits</b> because it adds unnecessary cost.|$|R
