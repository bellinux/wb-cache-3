Female August Copenhagen Irish (ACI) rats were treated with E 2, vitamin C, vita-min C + E 2, BHA and BHA + E 2 for up to 8  months.

The objective of the present study was to characterize the mechanism by which above antioxidants prevent DNA damage during breast carcinogenesis. 				 				 					 						Methods 					Female ACI rats were treated with E 2; Vit C; Vit C&# 8201;+&# 8201;E 2; BHA; and BHA&# 8201;+&# 8201;E 2 for up to 240 days. mRNA and protein levels of a DNA repair enzyme 8 -Oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG 1) and a transcription factor NRF 2 were quantified in the mammary and <b>mammary</b> tumor <b>tissues</b> of rats after treatment with E 2 and compared with that of rats treated with antioxidants either alone or in combination with E 2. 				 				 					 						Results 					The expression of OGG 1 was suppressed in <b>mammary</b> <b>tissues</b> and in <b>mammary</b> tumors of rats treated with E 2.

40|$|SUMMARY-The 2 most {{important}} hormones for development {{and growth of}} mammary tumors in rats are prolactin and estrogen, both under control of the pituitary gland and the brain. Estrogen stimulates prolactin secretion and acts with prolactin directly on the <b>mammary</b> <b>tissues</b> to promote tumori-genesis. Large doses of estrogen can inhibit mammary tumor growth, not by suppressing prolactin secretion but by interfering with the peripheral action of prolactin on the <b>mammary</b> <b>tissues.</b> Estrogen can neither induce nor maintain growth of mammary tumors {{in the absence of}} the pituitary, but prolactin may have a limited capacity to induce and maintain mammary tumor growth {{in the absence of the}} ovaries. Although rats show no sig-nificant change in serum-prolactin levels during growth of carcinogen-induced mammary tumors, elevations of serum prolactin produced by hypothalamic lesions, pituitary grafts, or administration of small doses of estrogen or appropriate drugs, can increase growth of spontaneous and carcinogen-induced mammary tumors.

To advance this discussion, we report the demonstration and localization of progestin-induced biosynthesis of growth hormone (GH) in canine <b>mammary</b> gland <b>tissue.</b> Nontumorous <b>mammary</b> <b>tissues</b> and tumors, both benign and malignant, were obtained from private household dogs. Immunoreactive GH was localized in mammary epithelial cells and correlated {{with the presence of}} GH mRNA. Local synthesis of GH was also proven immunoelectron microscopically by demonstrating GH-containing secretory granules. Cellular GH production in nontumorous tissues was more extensive during the progesterone-dominated luteal phase of the ovarian cycle or during exposure to synthetic progestins than during anestrus. GH was also associated with areas of hyperplastic mammary epithelium, which may indicate that locally produced GH enhances proliferation, acting in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner. In 41 of 44 tumors, GH was present. Of 3 GH-negative tumor samples, 2 were from progestin-depleted, castrated bitches. In nonmalignant <b>mammary</b> <b>tissues,</b> GH production is stimulated by progesterone and synthetic progestins interacting with progesterone receptors.

Thirty-five canine mammary carcinomas, 11 mammary adenomas, and normal, hyperplastic or dysplastic tissues taken at the marginal area of the tumours were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for HER- 2 expression, using the Hercept Test ® system scoring guidelines. HER- 2 over-expression was detected in 3 / 11 adenomas and 10 / 35 carcinomas. Normal, hyperplastic and dysplastic <b>mammary</b> <b>tissues</b> were also found to be positive. The correlations between HER- 2 expression and tumour histological grading, mitotic index, the presence of lymphatic invasion, and overall survival (OS) were evaluated.

This study was conducted to identify the cell-adhesion molecules involved in homing lymphocytes to the bovine mammary gland at four different physiological stages; pregnant, colostral, lactation and involution. The expression and distribution of adhesion molecules in alveolar tissues and supramammary lymph nodes from the mammary glands of healthy cows was determined in situ by immunohistochemical analysis and compared with bovine Peyer's patch, used as a typical mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue and positive control. The mucosal addressin molecule, MAdCAM- 1, was not detected in bovine <b>mammary</b> <b>tissues</b> at any of the four different physiological stages.

In contrast to MAdCAM- 1, phase-dependent protein expression of VCAM- 1 was detected in both <b>mammary</b> alveolar <b>tissues</b> and the supramammary lymph nodes, with the highest expression observed in colostral phase cows.

In addition, 33, 31 and 36 novel miRNAs from milk fat, whey and cells were identified, with 28 common in the three fractions. Among 20 most highly expressed miRNAs in each fraction, 14 were expressed in common and 11 were further shared with <b>mammary</b> gland <b>tissue.</b> The three milk fractions demonstrated a clear separation from each other using a hierarchical cluster analysis with milk fat and whey being most closely related.

Predicted target genes (1802) of 14 highly expressed miRNAs in milk fractions were enriched in fundamental cellular functions, infection, organ and tissue development. Furthermore, some miRNAs were highly enriched (FDR < 0. 05) in milk whey (3), cells (11) and <b>mammary</b> gland <b>tissue</b> (14) suggesting specific regulatory functions in the various fractions.
