40|$|This is the {{appendix}} {{to the paper}} Temporal Analysis of Static Priority Preemptive Scheduled Cyclic Streaming Applications using CSDF Models [1]. The temporal analysis approach presented in [1] makes use of an iterative algorithm that computes so-called <b>maximum</b> <b>busy</b> periods over multiple task phases. The algorithm contains a stop criterion indicating after which iteration of the algorithm subsequent iterations {{do not need to}} be considered. The intuition behind that stop criterion is given in the paper and supplemented by a formal proof in this appendix...|$|E
40|$|Virtual Path (VP) {{concept is}} gaining {{recently}} attention {{in terms of}} effective deployment of ATM networks. In this paper, we present models and algorithms for network design and management of ATM networks based on virtual path concept from a network planning perspective. Our approach is based on statistical multiplexing of traffic within a traffic class by using a virtual path for the class and deterministic multiplexing of different virtual paths, and on providing dynamic bandwidth and reconfigurability through virtual path concept depending on traffic load {{during the course of}} the day. For some realistic example networks, we observe that considering network dynamism through variation of traffic during the course of a day by doing dynamic bandwidth and virtual path reconfiguration can save between 10 to 14 % in network design costs compared to a static network based on <b>maximum</b> <b>busy</b> hour traffic.

This approach really enhances the capability and <b>maximum</b> utilization of <b>busy</b> channel. A complete transmission is always based upon correctness and delivery {{on time and}} the massage transmission is too much sensitive and crucial. In this paper, we establish the complete arrangement of combination of encryption and compression with double EHDES while transmitting over media. 1...|$|R
50|$|The NAV may {{be thought}} of as a counter, which counts down to zero at a uniform rate. When the counter is zero, the virtual CS {{indication}} is that the medium is idle; when nonzero, the indication is busy. The medium shall be determined to be busy when the STA is transmitting. In IEEE 802.11, the NAV represents the number of microseconds the sending STA intends to hold the medium <b>busy</b> (<b>maximum</b> of 32,767 microseconds).|$|R

This approach really enhances the capability and <b>maximum</b> utilization of <b>busy</b> channel. A complete transmission is always based upon correctness and delivery {{on time and}} the massage transmission is too much sensitive and crucial. In this paper, we establish the complete arrangement of combination of encryption and compression with double EHDES while transmitting over media. A lossless compression provides us integrity. Fuzzy error correction provides error less message over noisy channel...|$|R

A period of operation leads to fragmentation of vacant codes. This leads to code blocking problem. The assignment scheme proposed in this paper is not affected by fragmentation, as the fragmentation is generated by the scheme itself. In this scheme, the code tree is divided into groups whose capacity is fixed and numbers of members (codes) are variable. A group with <b>maximum</b> number of <b>busy</b> members is used for assignment, this leads to fragmentation of busy groups around code tree and compactness within group. The proposed scheme is well evaluated and compared with other schemes using parameters like code blocking probability and call establishment delay. Through simulations it has been demonstrated that the proposed scheme not only adequately reduces code blocking probability, but also requires significantly less time before assignment to locate a vacant code for assignment, which makes it suitable for the real-time calls...|$|R
30|$|While HSR–airline {{cooperation}} is appealing, its implementation {{is subject to}} a number of challenges. Perhaps, the most important one is the fact that airlines and HSR are owned by separate entities, who are operated under different objectives and by different institutions. Traditionally, they see each other as rivals and compete for the same consumers. After Tokyo’s successful bid to host the 2020 summer Olympics, discussions have begun on the use of Shizuoka Airport as a hub through which passengers from other countries could visit Tokyo and Osaka during the Olympics. The discussions have included two key issues. One is that the two major airports serving the Tokyo area, Narita and Haneda, are already operating at close to their <b>maximum</b> capacity during <b>busy</b> seasons. Any increase in demand during the Olympics would likely push these airports over their maximum flight capacities, leading to delays and other problems. Second, in the event of disruptions caused by earthquakes or other natural hazards, HSR–airline cooperation would provide a much-needed alternative to ensure reliable transportation during the Olympics. However, even during initial discussions, {{there have been a number}} of issues raised by the two main entities involved: the Japan Railway Company (JR) and Shizuoka prefecture. In particular, JR has argued that it presents a major engineering challenge and is technically impossible to construct an underground facility under the current location of Shizuoka Airport to link the airport to the HSR network. This suggests the Japanese government should not rely on the two parties to voluntarily engage in the discussion and implementation of HSR–airline cooperation.|$|R
