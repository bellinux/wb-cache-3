25|$|In 1986 Amstrad {{entered the}} IBM PC-compatible arena with the PC1512 system. In {{standard}} Amstrad livery and priced at £399 {{it was a}} success, capturing more than 25% of the European computer market. It was MS-DOS-based, but with the GEM graphics interface, and later Windows. In 1988 Amstrad attempted {{to make the first}} affordable portable personal computer with the PPC512 and 640 models, introduced a year before the Macintosh Portable. They ran MS-DOS on an 8MHz processor, and the built-in screen could emulate the <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> or Color Graphics Adapter. Amstrad's final (and ill-fated) attempts to exploit the Sinclair brand were based on the company's own PCs; a compact desktop PC derived from the PPC 512, branded as the Sinclair PC200, and the PC1512 rebadged as the Sinclair PC500.|$|E

[...] Some spreadsheet software for PC under MS-DOS, as Lotus 1-2-3, employed this character as the peseta symbol in their Spanish editions. [...] Subsequent international MS-DOS code pages, like code page 850 and others, deprecated this character in favour of some other national characters.|$|E
50|$|IBM {{initially}} offered two video adapters for the PC, the Color/Graphics <b>Adapter</b> and the <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> and Printer <b>Adapter.</b> CGA {{was intended}} to be a typical home computer display; it had NTSC output and could be connected to a composite monitor or a TV set with an RF modulator in addition to RGB for digital RGBI-type monitors, although IBM did not offer their own RGB monitor until 1983. Supported graphics modes were 40 or 80×25 color text with 8×8 character resolution, 320×200 bitmap graphics with two fixed 4-color palettes, or 640×200 monochrome graphics.|$|R
5000|$|Hercules Computer Technology, Inc. {{was formed}} in 1982 in Hercules, California, by Van Suwannukul and Kevin Jenkins {{and was one of}} the major {{graphics}} card companies of the 1980s. Its biggest products were the MDA-compatible Hercules Graphics Card (HGC) and Hercules Graphics Card Plus (HGC+) and the associated standard, which was widely copied and survived into the 1990s. The Hercules Graphics Card included a [...] "Centronics compatible" [...] parallel printer port, the same as the IBM <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> and Printer <b>Adapter</b> board that the card was based on. The company also produced CGA compatible cards, and with the unsuccessful Hercules InColor Card, it tried to go head-to-head with EGA.|$|R
5000|$|Among other {{novelties}} that Lotus introduced was a graph maker {{that could}} display several forms of graphs (including pie charts, bar graphics, or line charts) but required {{the user to}} have a graphics card. At this early stage, the only video boards available for the PC were IBM's Color/Graphics <b>Adapter</b> and <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> and Printer <b>Adapter</b> while the latter did not support any graphics. However, because the two video boards used different RAM and port addresses, both could be installed in the same machine and so Lotus took advantage of this by supporting a [...] "split" [...] screen mode whereby the user could display the worksheet portion of 1-2-3 on the sharper monochrome video and the graphics on the CGA display.|$|R

50|$|Like the IBM <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> it {{improved}} on, the Hercules Graphics Card {{had both}} a parallel printer port {{and a video}} output port.|$|E
50|$|For example, the {{monochrome}} video adapter {{memory area}} ran from 704 to 736 KiB (0xB0000-0xB7FFF). If only a <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> <b>adapter</b> was used, the address space between 0xA0000 and 0xAFFFF {{could be used}} for RAM, which would be contiguous with the conventional memory.|$|E
50|$|The IBM Personal Computer was {{launched}} in 1981 with the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) expansion card and the <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> And Printer <b>Adapter.</b> The CGA offered two basic operating modes: 320×200 pixel (or 40x25 character) low resolution or a 640x200 (or 80×25 characters) pixels high resolution mode. While the low-resolution mode was very comparable to 8-bit home computers of the era, the higher-resolution mode offered a fair advance, used with a suitable RGBI (or RGB) monitor (such as the IBM 5153 Personal Computer Color Display). Still, since by design CGA {{was able to be}} connected to cheap composite monitors and even to home TVs (via RF modulator), CGA was limited in resolution; its text modes has a character box size of 8x8 pixels, which made text fairly rough-looking, especially in the vertical direction, which had only one pixel row for descenders.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> was {{installed}} on the model 5570-S, {{also known as the}} first Micro Channel machine in PS/55, had a compatibility problem with PS/2. From the model 5550-S released in 1988, the <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> II {{was installed}} that had been resolved PS/2 compatibility. In the boot sequence, <b>display</b> <b>adapter</b> enabled VGA on the motherboard and the video signal was output through MCA connector and <b>display</b> <b>adapter.</b> When using Japanese DOS, VGA was disabled and <b>display</b> <b>adapter</b> switched the video signal from VGA to own graphics chip. In addition, 256 color mode (1024x768 pixels in 256 of 262,144 colors) was supported.|$|R

50|$|The Z-100 had unusually good {{graphics}} for its era, {{superior to}} the contemporary CGA (640×200 monochrome bitmap or 320×200 4-color), IBM <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> (MDA) (80×25 text-only), and arguably even the Hercules Graphics Card (720×348 monochrome). Early versions of AutoCAD were released for the Z-100 because of these advanced graphics.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} IBM PC contained this font as a 9×14 pixels-per-character font {{stored in}} the ROM of the IBM <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> (MDA) and an 8×8 pixels-per-character font of the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) cards. The IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) contained an 8×14 pixels-per-character version, and the VGA contained a 9×16 version.|$|E
50|$|The game {{used the}} Text mode {{of the early}} IBM PCs like the 5150. It used special {{characters}} from code page 437 to represent monsters, treasures, weapons, props, castle walls, etc. It could thus be played on even the earliest IBM PC display equipment, such as the IBM <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> and the IBM 5151 monitor.|$|E

5000|$|Simultaneously announced, The Monochrome Display and Printer Adapter (MDPA), often {{shortened}} to <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> (MDA), {{which did}} not support pixel-addressable graphics of any sort, offered a high-quality 80x25 character mode, having a relatively high pixel-resolution of 720x350 (character box size 9x14), {{that could be used}} on a monochrome monitor (originally, specifically the IBM 5151 Personal Computer Display).|$|E

50|$|The <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> (MDA, also MDA card, Monochrome Display and Printer Adapter, MDPA) is IBM's {{standard}} {{video display}} card and computer display {{standard for the}} PC introduced in 1981. The MDA {{does not have any}} pixel-addressable graphics modes. It has only a single monochrome text mode (PC video mode 7), which can display 80 columns by 25 lines of high resolution text characters or symbols useful for drawing forms.|$|E
50|$|It only {{produced}} green colors {{because it}} used P39 phosphor. IBM designed its MDA monochrome display system to deliver extremely well-formed characters for the time. The monitor {{was meant to}} be hooked up to an IBM <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> which had no graphics modes at all, and only supported the 80 x 25 text mode, using 9 x 14 pixels per character. The Hercules Graphics Card had its resolution designed around this monitor, allowing cheap high-resolution PC graphics, and some people also used 5151 monitors with EGA boards for their mono modes.|$|E

40|$|In {{diagnostic}} radiology, medical-grade <b>monochrome</b> <b>displays</b> {{are usually}} recommended {{because of their}} higher luminance. Standard color displays {{can be used as}} a less expensive alternative, but have a lower luminance. The aim of the present study was to compare image quality for these two types of displays. Images of a CDRAD contrast-detail phantom were read by four radiologists using a 2 -megapixel (MP) color display (143  cd/m 2 maximum luminance) as well as 2 -MP (295  cd/m 2) and 3 -MP <b>monochrome</b> <b>displays.</b> Thirty lumbar spine radiographs were also read by four radiologists using the color and the 2 -MP <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> in a visual grading analysis (VGA). Very small differences were found between the displays when reading the CDRAD images. The VGA scores were − 0. 28 for the color and − 0. 25 for the <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> (p[*]=[*] 0. 24; NS).

50|$|The {{original}} Compaq Deskpro (released in 1984), {{available in}} several disk configurations, was an XT-class PC {{equipped with an}} 8 MHz 8086 CPU and Compaq's unique display hardware that combined Color Graphics Adapter graphics with high resolution <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> text. As a result, it was both considerably faster than the IBM PC and had a much better quality text display compared to an IBM PC equipped with graphics. Like the earlier Compaq Portable, its hardware and BIOS was 100% compatible with the IBM PC Model 5150 (a characteristic that few other PC workalikes shared so soon after {{the establishment of the}} IBM standard).|$|E
50|$|The 5151 was {{designed}} {{to work with the}} PC's <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> (MDA) text-only graphics card, but the third-party Hercules Graphics Card became a popular companion to the 5151 screen because of the Hercules' comparatively high-resolution bitmapped 720×348 pixel monochrome graphics capability, much used for business presentation graphics generated from spreadsheets like Lotus 1-2-3. This was much higher resolution than the alternative IBM Color Graphics Adapter 320×200 pixel, or 640×200 pixel graphic standard. It could also run most programs written for the CGA card's standard graphics modes. Monochrome monitors continued to be used, even after the introduction of higher resolution color IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter and Video Graphics Array standards in the late 1980s, for dual-monitor applications.|$|E
