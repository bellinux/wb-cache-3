5|$|Barkley {{was invited}} by Bob Knight {{to try out}} for United States men's {{basketball}} team for the 1984 Summer Olympics. He <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to final cuts, but wasn't selected for the team, despite outplaying almost all of the front-court players there. According to Knight, Barkley was cut because of poor defense.|$|E
5|$|This was Cancellara's {{first year}} {{with his new}} team , which lacked the high caliber domestiques that Cancellara had in the past, meaning that winning would be tougher for Cancellara. His first major race {{of the year was}} the Tirreno–Adriatico, where he won the race's final stage which was an {{individual}} time trial. Cancellara came to the Milan–San Remo with the hopes of winning the race a second time. He positioned himself in an eight-man breakaway that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to the finish. As the group approached the finish line, Cancellara was bested in the sprint for the line by Australian Matthew Goss and Cancellara crossed the line in second.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, the Patriots {{had some}} success, earning a berth {{to the playoffs}} in 1976—as a wild card team—and in 1978—as AFC East champions. They lost {{in the first round}} both times. In 1985, they {{returned}} to the playoffs, and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to Super Bowl XX, which they lost to the Chicago Bears 46–10. Following their Super Bowl loss, they returned to the playoffs in 1986, but lost in the first round. The team would not make the playoffs again for eight more years. During the 1990 season, the Patriots went 1–15. They changed ownership three times in the ensuing 14 years, being purchased from the Sullivan family first by Victor Kiam in 1988, who sold the team to James Orthwein in 1992. Orthwein intended to move the team to his native St. Louis, Missouri (where it would have been renamed as the St. Louis Stallions), but instead sold the team in 1994 to its current owner Robert Kraft.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{other schools}} in Galway, the Jes has no {{adjacent}} playing fields. However, both the under-19 {{boys and the}} under 16-girls <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to <b>the</b> <b>All</b> Ireland finals in 2008.

25|$|Windows Explorer in Windows 95 was set as {{a spatial}} file manager model by default; because it also {{worked as a}} navigational file manager, {{directories}} could be opened in multiple windows, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> fail <b>all</b> <b>the</b> above criteria.

5|$|Murray next competed at the London 2012 Summer Olympics in singles, doubles, {{and mixed}} doubles. He partnered his brother Jamie Murray in doubles and {{suffered}} a first-round exit to Austria (Jürgen Melzer and Alexander Peya) in three sets. In the mixed doubles, Murray was partnered by Laura Robson. They <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{way to the}} finals where they lost to the Belarusian top seeds (Victoria Azarenka and Max Mirnyi) in three sets, settling for the silver medal. In singles, Murray lost only one set {{on his way to}} the finals where he met Federer, defeating him in straight sets, for the loss of just 7 games. By winning the Olympic gold medal, Murray became the first British man to win the Olympic singles gold medal in tennis since Josiah Ritchie in 1908, and only the 7th man in the open era to win two medals at the same Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Harris at TNA's Victory Road PPV {{event on}} July 17, 2007 and Tomko, Styles, and he {{losing to the}} team of Andrew Martin, Sting, and Abyss at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event on August 12, 2007 in a Doomsday Chamber of Blood match to become number one contender to the TNA Title, Cage restarted his feud with Samoa Joe. The two met at TNA's No Surrender PPV event on September 9, 2007, where Cage defeated Joe by disqualification when Joe refused to release his Coquina Clutch submission hold he had applied. The two had a rematch on October 14, 2007 at TNA's Bound for Glory PPV event with Matt Morgan as the special outside enforcer. There, Joe defeated Cage to end his 23-month-long undefeated streak by not officially being pinned nor made to submit. Cage and Joe fought one {{more time on the}} October 18, 2007 episode of Impact!, with a spot in the 2007 Fight for the Right tournament to become number one contender to the TNA Championship. Cage defeated Joe to gain entry. Cage <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to the final round of the tournament, where he fought Kaz on the November 8, 2007 episode of Impact!. Cage defeated Kaz, but due to interference from Styles and Tomko on Cage's behalf, the match was declared a no contest, with the finals being determined on November 11, 2007 at TNA's Genesis PPV event in a ladder match. Cage, however, failed to win the tournament final the second time around at Genesis.|$|E

50|$|Clark and Praimnath's descent {{through the}} {{floors of the}} impact was impeded by some debris and smoke, but by moving the debris, they <b>made</b> <b>it</b> passable. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> {{internal}} walls were made of light metal framework holding up thick drywall panels. These panels were fractured by the initial impacts and explosions, and their twisting and shaking blocked fire doors and stairwells and then shattered to make much of the dust after the buildings collapsed.|$|R

25|$|Both Portsmouth and Southampton {{have had}} women's {{counterparts}} in the past.

25|$|Despite {{being under}} Roman rule for almost 1000 years, the Seljuqs rapidly {{consolidated}} their holdings over Anatolia.

The result was that even when the Byzantine empire was not riddled with civil disputes, it could not defeat the Seljuq Turks, who rarely allowed the Byzantines to engage them, hence the slow campaigning of John Komnenus.|$|E
