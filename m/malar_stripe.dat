50|$|It is 22 cm long. This {{variable}} forest thrush {{is generally}} {{darker than the}} African thrush and has an orange (not yellow) bill. It is also darker than the Kurrichane thrush and has no <b>malar</b> <b>stripes.</b> Generally the birds get darker at higher altitudes.|$|R
50|$|It {{measures}} 20 to 21 cm {{from bill}} tip to tail tip. The southern races weigh about 70 g, but the northern race C. a. chrysura, only about 55 g. Males are on average larger and heavier then females. The sexes are best distinguished by their head markings, {{as the red}} and brown fore-crowns of males differ unmistakably from those of females that are black and spotted white. The <b>malar</b> <b>stripes</b> of males are red and that of females mottled black and white. The iris is usually dark red but variable, the mandibles slate grey, and the legs and feet greenish-olive. Juveniles are heavily streaked on the throat and breast and barred on the belly. They and have mottled <b>malar</b> <b>stripes,</b> and a brown to brownish-grey iris.|$|R
50|$|This is a small, dark {{woodpecker}} {{with dark}} irides. Barred {{black and white}} above, it usually has unbarred central tail feathers. Its dark buff underside has prominent dark streaking. The dark grey crown (with a red nape in males), strong black eyestripes, and thin dark <b>malar</b> <b>stripes</b> contrast with broad white supercilia and cheeks.|$|R
50|$|The male in {{breeding}} plumage has a blackish face mask almost encircled {{by a strong}} white supercilium and <b>malar</b> <b>stripe,</b> a bright orange-buff throat and breast, and small white wing patches on the greater coverts and inner median coverts. The female is duller overall, in particular having browner face mask, pale buffy-brown breast, and a buff supercilium and <b>malar</b> <b>stripe,</b> and smaller or no white wing patches. Males in immature and winter plumage are similar to females, except that adult males retain the white wing patches all year round.|$|E
50|$|The adult silver-throated tanager is 13 cm {{long and}} weighs 21 g. The male is mainly yellow, with black streaks down its back, and a whitish throat bordered above {{with a black}} <b>malar</b> <b>stripe.</b> The wings and tail are black with pale green edgings. The sexes are similar, but adult females have duller and greener-tinged yellow plumage, and {{sometimes}} dark mottling on the crown. Immatures are much duller and greener, with dusky wings, tail, back streaks and <b>malar</b> <b>stripe,</b> a grey throat and darker green wing edging. The silver-throated tanager's call is a distinctive sharp buzzy zzeeep. It does not sing.|$|E
50|$|The common potoo is {{virtually}} identical in appearance {{but has a}} very different voice consisting {{of a series of}} mournful, wailing whistles. The great potoo is larger and paler with no dark <b>malar</b> <b>stripe.</b>|$|E
50|$|This bunting {{has a long}} pink {{bill and}} is greyish above. The male has a {{distinctive}} white eye-ring that stands out {{in contrast to the}} grey hood.

50|$|The white-breasted mesite is a {{medium-sized}} terrestrial bird {{which is often}} described as rail-like (a family with which the mesites are sometimes placed). The species has a white face with distinctive facial markings (a white supercilium and dark <b>malar</b> <b>stripes)</b> and a short dark straight bill. The upperparts are rufous brown, the underside is white with a tawny chest band and a barred belly. The wings are short and rounded and the bird only flies a few metres when pursued. It has a melodic song and sings in the early morning and during the day.|$|R
5000|$|The school 's mascot is the [...] "Falcon". It {{is unknown}} {{what type of}} falcon on which it is based, and there are {{inconsistencies}} in various illustrations. The falcon lacks a <b>malar</b> <b>stripe</b> in most instances, and is of a color unseen in North America.|$|E
50|$|Leucistic {{birds have}} been recorded. Two {{specimens}} of male birds {{from the northern}} Western Ghats have been noted to have red-tipped feathers on the malar region almost forming a <b>malar</b> <b>stripe.</b> A female specimen from Lucknow has been noted to have grown an abnormal downcurved hoopoe-like bill.|$|E
50|$|The TÃ¡chira antpitta {{reaches a}} length of 17 cm. Its upperparts are brownish. Crown and nape are {{coloured}} grey. The mantle has black barrings. Throat and ear coverts are brown. It is further characterised by a white <b>malar</b> <b>stripe.</b> The lower belly is whitish, the flanks and the breast have grey barrings.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} part of a clade that {{contains}} the kestrel species with black <b>malar</b> <b>stripes,</b> a feature which apparently was not present in the most ancestral kestrels. They seem to have radiated in the Gelasian (Late Pliocene, roughly 2.5-2 mya, probably starting in tropical East Africa, as indicated by mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data analysis and considerations of biogeography. The common kestrel's closest living relative is apparently the nankeen or Australian kestrel (F. cenchroides), which probably derived from ancestral common kestrels settling in Australia and adapting to local conditions less than one million years ago, during the Middle Pleistocene.|$|R
500|$|The long-tailed ground roller's {{silhouette}} {{is highly}} distinctive {{due to its}} long tail and plump silhouette. The bird is [...] long, although its tail can contribute up to [...] of the length, which makes it the longest tail {{of any of the}} ground rollers. This ground roller has short wings and long, pinkish-brown legs. The male has a sandy buff crown and dark brown upperparts with black streaks. Its supercilium is a pale buff color, while the ear-coverts are brown. The eyes are brown, while the short and stout beak is black. Its tongue is long with a brush-like tip to help it collect insects. A white stripe is present {{at the base of the}} bill and is surrounded by brown and black <b>malar</b> <b>stripes.</b> These <b>malar</b> <b>stripes</b> and the black breastband frame a white throat. The tail has 15 to 20 dark brown bars marking it, while the outer rectrices are sky blue; this sky blue is also present on the wing-coverts. In flight, the bird's two black and white bands on the primaries and secondaries are conspicuous. The underparts are a light gray, and the breast white. The toes are zygodactylous, with the first and fourth toes turned outwards and the middle two toes turned inwards. The female resembles the male, but is smaller and has a narrower chestband and a shorter tail. Also, the female loses her tail while nesting. These differences make the long-tailed ground roller the only ground roller to definitively display sexual dimorphism. Juveniles of both sexes resemble the adult female, but have duller plumage, particularly in the black bands on the chest, neck, and eyes.|$|R
50|$|Dunn's lark is {{a stocky}} bird {{with a large}} head and broad wings. It is 14 to 15 cm long with a {{wingspan}} of 25 to 30 cm. The upperparts are pale sandy-brown with darker streaks. The underparts are whitish with some dark streaks on the breast. There is a pale stripe over the eye and a pale ring around it. Birds have dark moustachial and <b>malar</b> <b>stripes</b> and a dark mark under the eye. The short, broad tail is black below while the upperside is black with rusty-brown central feathers and pale outer feathers. The bill is large, heavy and pale pinkish or yellowish in colour. After moulting, the birds become gradually duller and the dark markings fainter as the plumage becomes more worn.|$|R
50|$|The 11.5 cm long, 6.5-7 g weight brown violetear is unmistakable; it {{is mainly}} dull brown, with a rufous rump and greyer underparts. There is a violet patch {{running back and}} down from the eye, a hermit-like <b>malar</b> <b>stripe,</b> and a {{glittering}} green and blue throat stripe. The bill is relatively short and almost straight.|$|E
50|$|In the Costa Rican subspecies, the rufous of {{the crown}} extends to behind the eye and is bordered on its {{anterior}} edge with black This black border is broken by a white eye ring.

5000|$|A {{study of}} mtDNA {{cytochrome}} b sequence data of some kestrels identified a clade containing the common kestrel and related [...] "malar-striped" [...] species, {{to the exclusion}} of such taxa as the greater kestrel (which lacks a <b>malar</b> <b>stripe),</b> the lesser kestrel (which is very similar to the common, but also has no <b>malar</b> <b>stripe),</b> and the American kestrel, which has a <b>malar</b> <b>stripe,</b> but its color pattern-apart from the brownish back-and also the black feathers behind the ear, which never occur in the true kestrels, are more reminiscent of some hobbies. The malar-striped kestrels apparently split from their relatives in the Gelasian, roughly 2.0-2.5 million years ago (Mya), and are seemingly of tropical East African origin. The entire [...] "true kestrel" [...] groupâexcluding the American speciesâis probably a distinct and quite young clade, as also suggested by their numerous apomorphies.Other studies have confirmed that the hierofalcons are a monophyletic group-and that hybridization is quite frequent at least in the larger falcon species. Initial studies of mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data suggested that the hierofalcons are basal among living falcons. The discovery of a NUMT proved this earlier theory erroneous; in reality, the hierofalcons are a rather young group, originating maybe {{at the same time as}} the start of the main kestrel radiation, about 2 Mya. Very little fossil history exists for this lineage. However, the present diversity of very recent origin suggests that this lineage may have nearly gone extinct in the recent past.|$|E
50|$|The Nilgiri pipit {{is about}} 12.6 - 14 cm long and is richly coloured, has dark lores, a buff {{supercilium}} and throat. It lacks any <b>malar</b> <b>stripes.</b> The flanks, breast {{and sides of}} neck are brighter buff and that bill is completely dark. The crown is heavily streaked in black as are the upperparts. The outer tail feathers are also buff coloured {{and there is no}} white in the plumage. The streaking on the breast is fine and it extends along the flanks.The first four primaries of the wing are almost equal and the fifth is about 1-2 mm shorter. The primaries from the second to the fifth are emarginate. The tail feathers are pointed and the second outer feather has a tapering triangle along the shaft and the third with a small triangle at the tip. Abnormal albino individuals have been reported.|$|R
5|$|The long-tailed {{ground roller}} (Uratelornis chimaera) is {{a species of}} bird in the ground roller family Brachypteraciidae, placed in the {{monotypic}} genus Uratelornis. Endemic to arid spiny forests near the coast in southwestern Madagascar, this ground roller occurs at extremely low population densities throughout its habitat. This species requires shade and a deep layer of leaves on the ground, and it is absent from parts of the spiny forest lacking these features. It has no recognized subspecies, and its closest relative is the scaly ground roller. The long-tailed ground roller is the only ground roller to definitively display sexual dimorphism (differences in plumage or size between sexes). It is a medium-sized bird with a plump silhouette and a long tail. The upperparts are dark brown with black streaks while the underparts are light gray. The white throat is framed by black <b>malar</b> <b>stripes</b> and a black breastband, and a white stripe is present {{at the base of}} the bill. Sky-blue feathers are visible at the edge of the wings and the tail. Calls are rarely made outside the breeding season, though multiple courtship calls are made.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a slender}} bird, 16 to 19 cm long, and weighs about 40 grams. The plumage is pale brown above with dark streaks. The underparts are pale with streaks on the breast. There is a pale stripe over {{the eye and}} dark <b>malar</b> and moustachial <b>stripes.</b> The long tail has white outer-feathers and is often wagged up and down. The legs are long and pinkish-brown while the bill is slender and brownish.|$|R
50|$|The band-tailed barbthroat is 10.2-11 cm {{long and}} weighs 5-5.8 g. {{it has a}} long decurved bill, and, as with other hermit hummingbirds, the sexes are similar.
