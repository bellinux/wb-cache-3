40|$|The {{paper will}} argue that the centre-periphery {{dynamics}} of the modernisation of sexuality is more complex and difficult to grasp than is usually shown in queer studies and gay history. Existing historiography on the emerging of a modern gay and lesbian identity has failed to study the links between different sites for the emergence of a gay and lesbian subculture. The contacts between Greenland and German and Danish missionaries, from the eighteenth century onward, profoundly influenced Inuit concepts of sexuality by imposing Christian norms of sexual restraint. The accelerating colonial domination of Greenland culminated in a conscious effort to “modernise” Greenlandic society from the 1950 s onward. Danish presence in Greenland increased from a handful of merchants and colonial officers to a substantial population of construction workers, economists, teachers, and bureaucrats. Did the colonisation of Greenland also influence Danish discourses on masculinity and sexuality? For metropolitan Danes, Greenland represents an idea of hyper-masculine adventure and extreme hardship. The diaries and travelogues by Danish explorer and national hero Knud Rasmussen are impregnated with his admiration for the arctic seal hunters he befriended during his extended stay in northernmost Greenland, and the Crown Prince Frederik’s sleigh rides over the inland ice rendered him huge popularity both in Greenland and in Denmark. Images of the weather-bitten prince travelling between the extreme outposts of his future realm was a symbolic rendering of Danish masculinity in the Arctic. Many sources testify that Greenlanders traditionally had an open and relaxed attitude to sexuality. There were no explicit condemnations of same-sex sexuality, but childlessness in women was regarded as a tragedy, and in the tales, women {{who did not want to}} marry were severely punished. The only folklore concerning same-sex sexuality concerns women who act as men and penetrate younger women. Indeed, if sexuality was not a taboo subject, it was highly gendered. When Greenlandic activists founded a gay rights organisation in 2002, they translated the Danish words bøsse (gay man) and lesbisk (lesbian woman) into two already existing Inuit words: arnaasaq (lit. ‘womanly man’) angutaasaq (lit. ‘manly woman’). These words have been used traditionally to designate men who prefer women’s work, such as sewing or cooking, to the male work, such as hunting. As opposed to the Danish National Associaltion for Gays and Lesbians (Landsforeningen for bøsser og lesbiske) the Greenlandic activists also wanted to include bisexuals in their organisation. There was no word for bisexual, so they had to invent one, tamanoortut, which literally means ‘both ways’. The mixture of a traditional gendered conception of non-normative sexuality and the western, Danish concepts of “gay” and “lesbian” shows how Greenlanders actively renegotiate the norms that arrive from <b>metropolitan</b> <b>Denmark.</b> Another example is how Greenlandic legislation handled the question of same-sex sexuality in the criminal law. For very long, there were separate sets of laws for Greenlanders and Danes living in Greenland, but in 1954 a joint Criminal Code was adopted. The law commission strove to preserve Greenlandic traditional laws as much as possible, but explicitly stated that they made an exception for sexual crimes, since Greenlandic customs were so different from what was acceptable in modern society. The result of this was that same-sex sexuality was regulated by the same rule as in Denmark, i. e. a higher age of consent for homosexual than for heterosexual relations. The society for gays, lesbians and bisexuals in Greenland, Qaamaneq, was dismantled in 2007. Some activists argue that it was because a lack of interest from its members, now that it is easier to find a partner via the Internet than via the dances that Qaamaneq arranged. Others say that the homophobic climate in Greenland results in a very small number of non-heterosexual people daring to be open. More research is needed to determine how sexual discourse in Greenland – and in Denmark – has been influenced by the colonial process. An anthropological project would be the best way of investigating the exact nature of the modernisation of sexuality in Greenland and Denmark...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{prevalence}} of Dientamoeba fragilis in patients from a <b>metropolitan</b> area in <b>Denmark</b> {{was determined by}} examination of paired stool samples using two techniques: a formol ethyl-acetate concentration technique with unpreserved faeces and a permanent staining technique on faeces preserved with sodium acetate–acetic acid–formalin (SAF). Using the SAF permanent staining technique and the formol ethyl-acetate concentration technique, 25 % and 15 % of the specimens, respectively, were parasite-positive. D. fragilis was detected in 12 of the 103 patients, only two of whom harboured other recognised pathogenic parasites.

40|$|The Øresund Region {{that connects}} Copenhagen <b>metropolitan</b> area in <b>Denmark</b> and Southern Sweden is an {{interesting}} example of a European cross-border collaboration. In this article, the contemporary development {{of the region and}} the place branding process is described. The aim is to increase understanding of how a complex and bi-national place brand is developed in a process of continuous change due to societal and political contexts. The article is inspired by a theoretical framework for place branding based on ideas from corporate branding (Kavaratzis, 2004) and organizational identity (Kavaratzis & Hatch, 2013), and emphasizes the role of media. The place branding process is defined in three contemporary phases: the public opinion phase, the invoking of a transnational brand phase, and the Europe of City-Regions phase. The analysis leads to two main conclusions: (1) the development of the current place brand at hand mirrors a possible change in geo-spatial focus in: from a transnational approach toward a bi-national city-based approach and (2) the case study suggests that a strategic communication logic, focusing residents rather than the wills of elites, is more relevant to such cases than a marketing logic...|$|R
