5|$|Digestion {{starts in}} buccal cavity (<b>mouth)</b> <b>as</b> {{partially}} chewed food is {{broken down by}} saliva from the salivary glands. As the salivary glands produce fluid and carbohydrate-digesting enzymes (mostly amylases), strong muscles in the pharynx pump fluid into the buccal cavity, lubricating the food like the salivarium does, and helping blood feeders, and xylem and phloem feeders.|$|E

It can be medically dangerous for active methamphetamine users because of the cardiac problems that can result from the interaction of local anesthetic with the drug.|$|E
5|$|The USGS also {{measured}} discharge at {{the village}} of Larrys Creek, very near the creek's <b>mouth,</b> <b>as</b> part of water quality measurements on seven occasions between 1970 and 1975. The average discharge was 66.0cubic feet per second (1.87m3/s), and ranged {{from a high of}} 114cubic feet per second (3.23m3/s) to a low of 8.8cubic feet per second (0.25m3/s). Lycoming County operates a stream gauge at Salladasburg as part of the county-wide flood warning system. It only measures the water height (not discharge) and had a peak gauge height of , on September 18, 2004 during Hurricane Ivan.|$|E

5|$|The king of {{one country}} {{threatened}} by the imminent arrival of the stoor worm sought {{the advice of a}} wise man or spaeman, who suggests that the beast might be appeased if it is fed seven virgins every week. In line with the wise man's advice, every Saturday the islanders provide a sacrificial offering of seven virgins, who were tied up and placed on the beach for the serpent to sweep into its <b>mouth</b> <b>as</b> it reared its head from the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Diane Ruggiero and directed by John T. Kretchmer, marking Ruggiero's sixteenth and penultimate writing credit and Kretchmer's twelfth directing credit. One scene in the episode depicts Veronica and Max sitting {{in the backseat of}} a vehicle with Chelsea's pimp (a woman) and several bodyguards. Kretchmer decided to place one of the physically domineering bodyguards between Max and Veronica for comedic effect. In addition, Thomas noted that the actress of the pimp, Jackie Debatin, appeared in a similar role in an episode of The Office several weeks after the episode aired. The scene in which Keith, in a Sheriff's uniform, spots Don Lamb in his car was difficult to edit because although there was initially no radio music playing, Michael Muhney, the actor of Lamb, was moving his <b>mouth</b> <b>as</b> if singing lyrics. Thomas reported difficulty in finding a song that would match the movements.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} the river is in the Mourne Mountains {{on the slopes of}} Ott Mountain. The river then flows in a northerly {{direction}} into Fofanny Dam. It continues its flow in a north-easterly direction into Tollymore Forest Park where the tributaries Spinkwee and Trassey rivers join it. The Shimna finally flows to the east, then takes a south easterly direction toward Newcastle where at one point it flows through Tipperary Wood. The final tributaries to join the river prior to it reaching the sea are the Burren River and the Tullybrannigan River, at Islands Park. Near the <b>mouth,</b> <b>as</b> it flows through Castle Park, it widens quite considerably to create a shallow boating pond. The river's geology, flora and fauna have made it an Area of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI).|$|E
40|$|A {{dynamical}} theory of traversable wormholes is detailed in spherical symmetry. Generically a wormhole {{consists of a}} tunnel of trapped surfaces between two <b>mouths,</b> defined <b>as</b> temporal outer trapping horizons with opposite senses, in mutual causal contact. In static cases, the <b>mouths</b> coincide <b>as</b> the throat of a Morris-Thorne wormhole, with surface gravity providing an invariant measure of the radial curvature or "flaring-out". The null energy condition must be violated at a wormhole mouth. Zeroth, first and second laws are derived for the <b>mouths,</b> <b>as</b> for black holes. Dynamic processes involving wormholes are reviewed, including enlargement or reduction, and interconversion with black holes. A new area of wormhole thermodynamics is suggested.

2500|$|Lactobacillus paracasei [...] (commonly {{abbreviated}} as L. paracasei) is a gram-positive, facultatively heterofermentative {{species of}} {{lactic acid bacteria}} that are commonly used in dairy product fermentation and probiotics.

It may be used by <b>mouth,</b> <b>as</b> an injection into a muscle, or intravenously. Haloperidol typically works within thirty to sixty minutes. A long-acting formulation may be used as an injection every four weeks in people with schizophrenia or related illnesses, who either forget or refuse to take the medication by mouth.|$|E
