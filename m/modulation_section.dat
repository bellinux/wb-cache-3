40|$|Wireless {{communication}} had {{a revolutionary}} breakthrough about two decades ago, {{and is still}} growing. However {{the growth in the}} short term is expected to be {{in the form of an}} evolution rather than a new revolution. Communication over Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) channels, among other things, is one of the suggested method in response to the ever increasing demand for high data rate applications. This thesis discusses the communication over MIMO channel from the link layer prospective. The thesis can be divided in two major sections: modulation and coding. Some modulation schemes are proposed for both parallel Rayleigh fading and parallelized MIMO channels. To parallelize MIMO channel perfect CSI at both transmitter and receiver is assumed. The <b>Modulation</b> <b>section</b> consists of two parts. One part deals with optimization of regular constellation such as QPSK, 8 PSK, and 16 QAM based on the constellation rotation over Rayleigh fading for aforementioned type of channels. Another section investigates constellation rearrangement for higher level modulation schemes such as 16 QAM. Different mappings are used to convey information over different parallel channels. Constellation Rearrangement is performed by maximization of minimum Euclidean distance between the constellation points in the augmented signal space. In the coding section, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes are studied for the MIMO channels with perfect and partial CSI at the transmitter. By simulation results, it is shown that LDPC code with CSI at the transmitter (CSIT) can obtain results close to the channel capacity. ii...|$|E
40|$|Semiconductor {{quantum dot}} (QD) lasers are {{competitive}} candidates for many {{applications such as}} high-speed long-haul optical communication systems. This is due to their superior lasing characteristics (compared to conventional quantum well (QW) lasers) and also their potential for high differential gain and direct modulation with negligible chirp. Recently, substantial efforts {{have been made to}} improve the modulation characteristics of QD semiconductor lasers such as enhancing the modulation efficiency and improving the overall modulation bandwidth. The gain lever effect is a method used to enhance the efficiency of amplitude modulation and optical frequency modulation at microwave frequencies by taking advantage of the sub-linear nature of the gain versus carrier density. Previously, two-section quantum well lasers have been investigated theoretically and experimentally to explore the gain lever effect. As for QD devices, which are extremely promising because of the strong gain saturation effect in dots, have not been investigated until recently. In this thesis, first the characteristics and applications of conventional two-section gain lever semiconductor lasers are presented. In related previous studies, gain levered single and multiple QW lasers have been used to enhance the modulation efficiencies in both intensity (IM) and frequency (FM) modulation. In this work, the modulation characteristics of a gain lever QD laser diode is demonstrated for the first time. In this work we report an amplitude modulation enhancement of 8 -dB for a p-doped two-section quantum dot laser and discuss the relation between the normalized 3 -dB bandwidth and the <b>modulation</b> <b>section</b> gain for different power levels. Also based on rate equations and small signal analysis, a novel modulation response equation is derived to describe the device dynamics. Using the new modulation response function the actual gain lever ratio can be measured for various power levels. For future work, the gain lever laser structure can be optimized to reduce the effect of non-linear gain suppression which directly limits the efficiency enhancement through the damping factors and relaxation oscillation frequency.

30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to take {{advantage}} of the orthogonality property resulting from the CDMA-OFDM/OQAM combination introduced in [11] to get a new MIMO Alamouti scheme with OFDM/OQAM. The contents of our paper is as follows. In Section 2, after some general descriptions of the OFDM/OQAM <b>modulation</b> in <b>Section</b> 2.1 and the MIMO Alamouti scheme in Section 2.2, we will combine both techniques. However, as we will see in Section 2.3, the MIMO decoding process is very difficult because of the orthogonality mismatch between Alamouti and OFDM/OQAM. In Section 3, we propose to combine Alamouti and CDMA-OFDM/OQAM in order to solve the problem. Indeed, in [11], we have shown that the combination of CDMA and OFDM/OQAM (CDMA-OFDM/OQAM) can provide the complex orthogonality property; this interesting property is first recalled in Section 3.1. Then, two different approaches with Alamouti coding are proposed, by considering either a spreading in the frequency (in Section 3.2) or in the time domain (in Section 4.2). When spreading in time is considered, 2 strategies of implementing the Alamouti coding are proposed. Some simulation results finally show that, using particular channel assumptions, the Alamouti CDMA-OFDM/OQAM technique achieves similar performance to the Alamouti CP-OFDM system.|$|R
