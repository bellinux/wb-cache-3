40|$|Lubricants {{and liquid}} cooling {{are used in}} many {{industrial}} applications to ensure reliability and longevity of <b>machinery.</b> <b>Oil</b> cooling of both electrical and mechanical applications is of interest since oil is better suited for electrical applications than water and already available in {{the system as a}} lubricant. Brazed plate heat exchangers (BPHEs) have many advantages compared to other heat exchanger types commonly used in oil cooling applications. Flow maldistribution inside BPHEs can arise with highly viscous fluids like oil. Since flow is hard to measure when plate heat exchangers are brazed together, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be used instead. This study investigates parameters that could affect flow distribution inside BPHEs with the CFD-tool COMSOL Multiphysics. The study is made on three different geometries at different detail levels. The purpose of the study is to expand the knowledge about fluid behavior in BPHEs and how it affects efficiency. It was proved from the Bernoulli equation that flow velocity, gravity and Reynolds number were some parameters that could affect flow distribution inside BPHEs. Two simplified models were built for evaluation of viscosity, gravity and Reynolds number. A more detailed model was provided by SWEP representing the fluid domain of a full-size distribution zone model. Model validation and mesh independence study were made with expressions {{due to the lack of}} experimental data. Investigations of viscosity, gravity and Reynolds number were made through isolation and alteration of the respective parameter. The validation and mesh independence study proved the models trustworthy and detailed enough to capture the physical behavior. Small deviations from expected validation results can be explained with the assumptions and simplifications made in the process. Results show that flow maldistribution increases with viscosity differences between channels. Viscosity maldistribution is greater for oil than for water. It is important to consider how the fluid viscosity changes with temperature under the respective working conditions. Gravity has no effect on flow distribution as long as it acts along or opposite the main flow direction. As plate heat exchangers are generally placed vertically, gravity will not affect flow distribution. Gravity has a significant effect on flow distribution if plate packages are places horizontally. High Reynolds numbers have a positive effect on flow distribution and reduce the difference between highest and lowest velocities across the outlet. Very low flow velocities should therefore be avoided since it increases flow maldistribution...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This study {{concentrates}} on developing and tuning various oil analysis methods {{to meet the}} requirements of modern industry and environmental analytics. Oil analysis methods form a vital part of techniques used to monitor the condition of machines and may help to improve the overall equipment effectiveness value of a factory in a significant manner. Worm gears are used in various production machines, and their breakdowns may cause significant production losses. Wearing of these gears is relatively difficult to monitor with vibration analysis. Analysis of two indicator metals, copper and iron, may reveal wearing phenomena of worm gears effectively, and savings can be significant. Effective wear metal analysis requires good tools. ICP-OES with kerosene dilution is widely used in wear metal analysis, but purchasing and using of ICP-OES is expensive. A cheaper FAAS technique with similar pre-treatment of oil samples was tested and it proved to be useful especially in analyzing small amounts of samples. The accuracy of FAAS was sufficient for quantitative work in machine diagnostics and waste oil characterization. Solid debris analyses are useful in oil contamination control as well as in detection of wearing mechanisms. Membrane filtration, optical microscopy, SEM and automatic particle counting were applied in analysis of rolling and gear oils. Particle counting is an effective way to detect oil contamination, but in the studied cases even larger particles than those detected in normal ISO classes would be informative. However, membrane filtration and optical microscopy may reveal the wearing machine element exactly. Additives provide oils with desired properties thus they should be monitored intensively. A FTIR method for quantitative analysis of fatty alcohols and fatty acid esters in machinery oils was developed during this work. It has already been used successfully in quantitative and qualitative analysis of <b>machinery</b> <b>oil</b> samples. Various kinds of oils may be spilled into the soil during use and in accident situations, and they can migrate to groundwater layers. Biodegradation of oils can remove them from the soil or water completely or at least diminish the amount of harmful substances. An automatic, respirometric BOD OxiTop method was used to evaluate the biodegradability of various oils in water and soil media. The biodegradation of certain bio and mineral hydraulic oils was evaluated in groundwater, where bio oils usually biodegraded more effectively than mineral oils. The use of oils in machines weakened especially the biodegradability of bio oils. Biodegradability of bio oils was also studied in standard conditions of OECD 301 F and bio oils usually biodegraded moderately good in these conditions. The biodegradation of forestry chain oils and wood preservative oils was evaluated in forest soils. Linseed oil biodegraded moderately, but certain experimental wood preservatives biodegraded more effectively. Widely used creosote oil biodegraded in a lesser degree. Rapeseed oil-based chain oils biodegraded more effectively than corresponding tall oil...|$|E
