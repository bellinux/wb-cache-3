5|$|Though Tucker and Maria {{were warned}} against her having more {{children}} in her vulnerable physical and emotional state, she again conceived, and died in pregnancy in February 1823. In the carriage to Washington after the funeral, Tucker muffled {{his face with a}} handkerchief to hide his tears and feigned a toothache in response to inquirers. Maria's death indeed weighed heavily upon him, as he reflected on his plausible neglect in the midst of her travails. He also was <b>much</b> <b>concerned</b> for his son Daniel's indolence and unbalanced behavior which years later would result in the son's hospitalization and ultimate death in 1838 in Philadelphia.|$|E
25|$|Leopold Mozart was <b>much</b> <b>concerned</b> with a naturalistic feel to his compositions, his Jagdsinfonie (or Sinfonia da Caccia {{for four}} horns and strings) calls for shotguns, and his Bauernhochzeit (Peasant Wedding) {{includes}} bagpipes, hurdy-gurdy, a dulcimer, whoops and whistles (ad. lib.), and pistol shots.|$|E
25|$|During the mid-1930s, Nehru was <b>much</b> <b>concerned</b> with {{developments}} in Europe, {{which seemed to}} be drifting toward another world war. He was in Europe in early 1936, visiting his ailing wife, shortly before she died in a sanitarium in Switzerland. Even at this time, he emphasised that, in the event of war, India's place was alongside the democracies, though he insisted that India could only fight in support of Great Britain and France as a free country.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{his lack}} of worldly success, Koechlin was {{apparently}} a loved and venerated figure in French music, with his long flowing beard contributing to his patriarchal image. Following his 1888 illness, the need to build up his strength led him to become an enthusiastic mountaineer, swimmer and tennis player. He was also an amateur astronomer and an accomplished photographer. He {{was one of the}} great nature-mystics among French composers, whose personal creed was pantheistic rather than Christian. Though never a member of the Communist Party he subscribed to its ideals, and in the later 1930s especially was <b>much</b> <b>concerned</b> with the idea of 'Music for the People'.|$|E
25|$|Kagyu(pa), Oral Lineage. This {{contains}} {{one major}} subsect and one minor subsect. The first, the Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to Gampopa. In turn, the Dagpo Kagyu {{consists of four}} major sub-sects: the Karma Kagyu, headed by a Karmapa, the Tsalpa Kagyu, the Barom Kagyu, and Pagtru Kagyu. The once-obscure Shangpa Kagyu, which was famously represented by the 20th-century teacher Kalu Rinpoche, traces its history back to the Indian master Niguma, sister of Kagyu lineage holder Naropa. This is an oral tradition which is very <b>much</b> <b>concerned</b> with the experiential dimension of meditation. Its most famous exponent was Milarepa, an 11th-century mystic.|$|E
25|$|Eventually {{the line}} was deemed {{to be ready for}} {{inspection}} by the Board of Trade on 10 January 1848. Captain Robert Michael Laffan RE carried out the inspection and issued an unfavourable report dated 3 March. He was <b>much</b> <b>concerned</b> that the permanent way was very roughly laid and unballasted in places; neither were there any signals. Furthermore, he deemed that a bridge had been constructed in a hasty manner with the result that, when tested, it exhibited very great deflection. Other defects included poor drainage in cuttings and a lack of mileposts. Captain Laffan's opinion was that it was therefore unsafe to allow the line to be opened.|$|E

25|$|According to Khurram Mahmood If {{we observe}} only Punjab {{as being a}} Muslim {{majority}} province, there was no support for Muslim League, of any type from rural areas except some limited urban circles. Therefore, to secure the support of Muslim masses, Jinnah comprehended that it was essential to reorganise PPML. Jinnah was <b>much</b> <b>concerned</b> {{about the future of}} League in Punjab, because being a Muslim majority province it held a significant position in his eyes. As far as the re-organization of League was concerned, it was a long-term plan and could take several years, but election was due shortly. Therefore, Jinnah decided to co-opt with Unionist Party. For him it was the best solution as a short cut to the successful rebirth of Punjab Muslim League.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{distinction}} between measuring and improving software quality in an embedded system (with emphasis on risk management) and software quality in business software (with emphasis on cost and maintainability management) is becoming somewhat irrelevant. Embedded systems now often include a user interface and their designers are as <b>much</b> <b>concerned</b> with issues affecting usability and user productivity as their counterparts who focus on business applications. The latter are in turn looking at ERP or CRM system as a corporate nervous system whose uptime and performance are vital {{to the well-being of}} the enterprise. This convergence is most visible in mobile computing: a user who accesses an ERP application on their smartphone is depending on the quality of software across all types of software layers.|$|E
25|$|The poor {{indicated}} they were not so <b>much</b> <b>concerned</b> about the tariff charged by the private water companies, since it was {{much lower than the}} prices they had to pay to private vendors. They were much more concerned about the high connection fees to the network that were unaffordable for most of them. While wealthier residents use suction pumps and storage tanks to improve supply, poorer residents suffer more from low pressure and intermittent supply. Water vendors are not effectively regulated in terms of service quality and prices charged. Obtaining water from private wells or hydrants involves queuing of up to two hours and costs of 15,000 Rupiahs (US$1.66) per month and family. Bottled water was also frequently bought at a cost of up to 85,000 Rupiahs (US$9.44) per month and family. Water from wells is often polluted with bacteria and salty, with salt levels increasing in the Northern parts of the city closer to the coast. Groundwater in some areas has high iron content and needs to be filtered. According to the Jakarta Environmental Management Body 90 percent of groundwater was contaminated by metal, nitrate and e-coli in 2011. Boiling of water is frequent. Water from the public network, including at public hydrants, is sometimes only available for several hours per day and not always of good quality.|$|E

25|$|Sociology {{of law is}} {{a diverse}} field of study that {{examines}} the interaction of law with society and overlaps with jurisprudence, philosophy of law, social theory and more specialised subjects such as criminology. The institutions of social construction, social norms, dispute processing and legal culture are key areas for inquiry in this knowledge field. Sociology of law is sometimes seen as a sub-discipline of sociology, but its ties to the academic discipline of law are equally strong, and it is best seen as a transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary study focused on the theorisation and empirical study of legal practices and experiences as social phenomena. In the United States the field is usually called law and society studies; in Europe it is more {{often referred to as}} socio-legal studies. At first, jurists and legal philosophers were suspicious of sociology of law. Kelsen attacked one of its founders, Eugen Ehrlich, who sought to make clear the differences and connections between positive law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law' or social norms that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching barristers and courts. Contemporary research in sociology of law is <b>much</b> <b>concerned</b> with the way that law is developing outside discrete state jurisdictions, being produced through social interaction in many different kinds of social arenas, and acquiring a diversity of sources of (often competing or conflicting) authority in communal networks existing sometimes within nation states but increasingly also transnationally.|$|E
25|$|Reima Pietilä {{had also}} {{been active in the}} {{activities}} of the Museum of Finnish Architecture as well as publishing theoretical articles in Le Carré Bleu and Arkkitehti. Pietilä even attended a meeting of the Team X group of architects, held in 1972 at Cornell University in the USA, who were very <b>much</b> <b>concerned</b> with questions of structuralism in architecture, that is emphasising the elements of culture, somewhat in reaction to the universalising tendencies of modernism, especially as originally promoted by Team X's instigators, the older generation of CIAM. Pietilä took a diametric viewpoint to that of the rationalist school, and though the works (designed in partnership with his wife Raili Pietilä) had much of the organic idiosyncrasies of Aalto, they were far more abstract and nebulous. In arguing that nature is the apotheosis of plasticity, he demanded a morphological analysis of architectural products, considering Euclidean geometry as an inadequate instrument of analysis. His first major work, the Finnish Pavilion at the 1958 Brussels Expo did in fact take a modular approach akin to the theories of Blomstedt; however, the wooden rectangular box-like units as a whole gave a foretaste of Pietilä's later surfaces based entirely on free form; the most notable of these organic works being Kaleva Church, Tampere (1959–66), Dipoli student assembly building, Espoo (1961–66), Metso Library, Tampere (1978–86) and culminating in his final work, the Official Residence of the President of Finland, Mäntyniemi, Helsinki (1983–93). All these buildings had been the result of open architectural competitions.|$|E

It cited Andrew Ryder, a theologian at All Hallows College in Dublin, who wrote, [...] "While he may not use the language of traditional Christian spirituality, Tolle is very <b>much</b> <b>concerned</b> that, as we make our way through the ordinary events of the day, we keep in touch with the deepest source of our being." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1894 Busoni {{settled in}} Berlin, which he {{henceforth}} regarded as his home base, except {{during the years}} around World War I. His earlier feelings about the city had been unsympathetic: in an 1889 letter to Gerda he had described it as [...] "this Jewish city that I hate, irritating, idle, arrogant, parvenu". The city was swiftly growing in population and influence at this period and determined to stake itself as the musical capital of the united Germany; but as Busoni's friend the English composer Bernard van Dieren points out [...] "international virtuosi who for practical reasons chose Berlin as their abode were not so <b>much</b> <b>concerned</b> with questions of prestige", and for Busoni the city's development as [...] "the centre of the musical industry [...] develop an atmosphere which [...] detested more than the deepest pool of stagnant convention".|$|E

[...] Lupton compares Angelou's informal education described in this book with the education of other Black writers of the 20th century. [...] Like writers such as Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, and James Baldwin, Angelou did not earn a college degree and depended upon the [...] "direct instruction of African American cultural forms". She {{did not feel that}} her education ended at high school, however. [...] As Hagen points out, since Angelou was encouraged to appreciate literature as a young child, she continues to read, exposing herself {{to a wide variety of}} authors, ranging from Countee Cullen's poetry to Leo Tolstoy and other Russian authors. She states, during her stint as a madame, [...] "when my life hinged melodramatically on intrigue and deceit, I discovered the Russian writers".|$|E
500|$|As soon as {{the venue}} was finalised, Rajaji made further {{preparations}} for the march. A Government record pointed {{out that he was}} very <b>much</b> <b>concerned</b> about modeling the march on the lines of Gandhi's Dandi March. He estimated that a minimum sum of [...] was needed to organise the rally. He successfully managed to collect the funds with the help of Sourashtras of Madurai and South Indians in Bombay and Ahmedabad. Rajaji had formulated an advance guard that consisted of T. S. S. Rajan, G. Ramachandran and Thiruvannamalai N. Annamalai Pillai. Even before the march took off, the guard traveled along the proposed route and met the villagers to ensure support from them. Rajan was in charge of fixing the halt points for the march and took care of food and accommodation at each stage. The promulgation of section 157 of the Indian Penal Code made it a difficult task for Rajan. J. A. Thorne, the district collector of Tanjore, issued a warning that those who provide food and accommodation to the marchers shall be punished. He tried his best by widely publicising his order throughout his jurisdiction.|$|E
500|$|As Lupton points out, all of Angelou's autobiographies, {{especially}} Caged Bird and {{its immediate}} sequel Gather Together in My Name, are [...] "very <b>much</b> <b>concerned</b> with what [...] knew {{and how she}} learned it". Lupton compares Angelou's informal education with the education of other Black writers of the twentieth century, who did not earn official degrees and depended upon the [...] "direct instruction of African American cultural forms". Angelou's quest for learning and literacy parallels [...] "the central myth of black culture in America": that freedom and literacy are connected. Angelou is influenced by writers introduced to her by Mrs. Flowers during her self-imposed muteness, including Edgar Allan Poe and William Shakespeare. Angelou states, early in Caged Bird, that she, as the Maya character, [...] "met {{and fell in love}} with William Shakespeare". Critic Mary Vermillion sees a connection between Maya's rape and Shakespeare's [...] "The Rape of Lucrece", which Maya memorizes and recites when she regains her speech. [...] Vermillion maintains that Maya finds comfort in the poem's identification with suffering. Maya finds novels and their characters complete and meaningful, so she uses them to make sense of her bewildering world. She is so involved in her fantasy world of books that she even uses them as a way to cope with her rape, writing in Caged Bird, [...] "...I was sure that any minute my mother or Bailey or the Green Hornet would bust in the door and save me".|$|E
