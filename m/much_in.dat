5|$|Some critics {{claim that}} Yeats spanned the {{transition}} from the nineteenth century into twentieth-century modernism in poetry much as Pablo Picasso did in painting while others question whether late Yeats has <b>much</b> <b>in</b> common with modernists of the Ezra Pound and T.

5|$|A {{significant}} {{step in the}} process of acceptance back into the Olympic Movement was achieved at a ceremony held in Cardiff in November 1994, when the IRB was officially confirmed as a Recognised International Federation of the IOC. At that ceremony, International Olympic Committee President, Juan Antonio Samaranch, pointed out that rugby's history and values were very <b>much</b> <b>in</b> tune with the Olympic philosophy and traditions. This historic meeting in Cardiff led to IRB representation at annual IOC meetings and consideration for inclusion in the programme of future Olympic Games. In 2002, a plan was presented to induct rugby sevens, golf and the Chinese martial art of wushu.|$|E
5|$|After Romania {{joined the}} war {{on the side of}} the Triple Entente in August and was quickly overrun by the Central Powers, the Russian efforts in the Black Sea in the second half of 1916 were focused in the west. Because German {{submarines}} never really accomplished all that <b>much</b> <b>in</b> the Black Sea, the February 1917 resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare led the Germans to temporarily abandon the Black Sea in lieu of the more target-rich Mediterranean. UB-14s whereabouts and activities during the latter half of 1916 and the first few months of 1917 are unreported in sources.|$|E
5|$|After {{his first}} novel, The Wooden Horse, in 1909, Walpole wrote prolifically, {{producing}} {{at least one}} book every year. He was a spontaneous story-teller, writing quickly to get all his ideas on paper, seldom revising. His first novel to achieve major success was his third, Mr Perrin and Mr Traill, a tragicomic story of a fatal clash between two schoolmasters. During the First World War {{he served in the}} Red Cross on the Russian-Austrian front, and worked in British propaganda in Petrograd and London. In the 1920s and 1930s Walpole was <b>much</b> <b>in</b> demand not only as a novelist but also as a lecturer on literature, making four exceptionally well-paid tours of North America.|$|E

60|$|There was too <b>much</b> colour <b>in</b> her cheeks, too <b>much</b> energy <b>in</b> her manner, too <b>much</b> {{firmness}} <b>in</b> her voice.

5|$|Although American Graffiti {{is set in}} 1962 Modesto, California, Lucas {{believed}} the city had changed too <b>much</b> <b>in</b> 10 years and initially chose San Rafael as the primary shooting location. Filming began on June 26, 1972. However, Lucas soon became frustrated {{at the time it}} was taking to fix camera mounts to the cars. A key member of the production had also been arrested for growing marijuana, and, in addition to already running behind the shooting schedule, the San Rafael City Council immediately became concerned about the disruption that filming caused for local businesses and therefore withdrew permission to shoot beyond a second day.|$|E
5|$|Although Jardine was a {{qualified}} solicitor {{he did not}} work <b>much</b> <b>in</b> law, choosing instead to devote most of his working life to banking and, later on, journalism. He joined the Territorial Army in the Second World War {{and spent most of}} it posted in India. After the war, he worked as company secretary at a paper manufacturer and also returned to journalism. While on a business trip in 1957, he became ill with what proved to be lung cancer and died, aged 57, in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Athens' local country {{scene has}} never been as {{significant}} as the profusion of indie rock bands; however, modern Athens rock takes many elements from the folk, bluegrass and country traditions, including such bands as the Normaltown Flyers. The band Drive-By Truckers, and the , have done <b>much</b> <b>in</b> recent years to make country rock {{a major part of}} Athens' musical identity. Recent bands such as The Broken String Band have emerged influenced by the folk rock genre. The rapper Bubba Sparxxx, originally from South Georgia, has also helped diversify Athens' country heritage, by adding a rural image and elements of country music to his Dirty South style of hip hop music.|$|E

5|$|Beilhart {{was born}} March 4, 1867 in Columbiana County, Ohio to a Lutheran {{father and a}} Mennonite mother. The ninth of 11 children, Beilhart {{was raised in the}} Lutheran church and his early home {{environment}} was strictly religious. Jacob did not receive <b>much</b> <b>in</b> the way of formal education. His father died when he was six or seven years old so Jacob attended only elementary school. At the age of 17, Beilhart went to work at his brother-in-law's harness shop in southern Ohio and, when they moved to Ottawa, Kansas, Jacob went with them.|$|E
5|$|Between 1835 and 1850, Sir Charles Barry remodelled {{the castle}} in the Scottish Baronial style for the 2nd Duke of Sutherland. Barry {{had been the}} {{architect}} for the Palace of Westminster, home to the House of Commons, and was <b>much</b> <b>in</b> demand. The 14th-century tower, and the 17th-century and 18th-century extensions, were retained, and survive within Barry's 19th-century work.|$|E
5|$|Brettingham was {{commissioned}} in 1742 to redesign Langley Hall, a mansion standing {{in its own}} parkland in South Norfolk. His design was very <b>much</b> <b>in</b> the Palladian style of Holkham, though much smaller: a large principal central block linked to two flanking secondary wings by short corridors. The corner towers, while similar to those later designed by Brettingham at Euston Hall, were {{the work of a}} later owner and architect. The neoclassical entrance lodges were a later addition, by Sir John Soane. In 1743, Brettingham began work on the construction of Hanworth Hall, Norfolk, also in the Palladian style, with a five-bay facade of brick with the centre three bays projected with a pediment.|$|E

5|$|By 1891, Marsh {{published}} a more familiar view of Stegosaurus, {{with a single}} row of plates. This was dropped fairly early on (apparently because it was poorly understood how the plates were embedded in the skin and they were thought to overlap too <b>much</b> <b>in</b> this arrangement). It was revived, in somewhat modified form, in the 1980s, by Stephen Czerkas, based on the arrangement of iguana dorsal spines.|$|E
5|$|By 1910 {{there were}} only a dozen {{fishermen}} in six families living there, and in summer 1912 the island was finally abandoned. Some may have wished to stay, but by now the population had been reduced below a viable number and the lack of a school, which had closed in April 1910, would have been a factor. There is also no doubt that the parish priest, Donald Martin, encouraged the desertion. It is claimed that neither did he like travelling there, nor did the church receive <b>much</b> <b>in</b> the collection box on his visits.|$|E
5|$|Dejan {{was one of}} the {{prominent}} figures of Dušan's reign and during the subsequent fall of the Serbian Empire, after Dušan's death. Under Emperor Dušan, despot Jovan Oliver, with his brother Bogdan and sevastokrator Dejan, ruled over all of eastern Macedonia. Dejan is not mentioned <b>much</b> <b>in</b> Dušan's military endeavors, although his reputation and that of his successors suggest that he was involved in most of Dušan's successes. His prominence beyond Serbia is also evident from the fact that Pope Innocent VI addressed Dejan in 1355, asking him to support the creation of the union between the Catholic Church and the Serbian Orthodox Church (such letters were sent to the highest nobility and the church).|$|E

5|$|From the hoppers, {{the waste}} falls onto the furnace-charging chute {{and from there}} onto the incinerating grate. Here it is burned at a {{temperature}} in excess of 1,200°C. This heat is then converted into super heated steam through the plant's boilers. This in turn powers steam turbines, <b>much</b> <b>in</b> {{the same way as}} a conventional thermal power station. Electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts. After exiting the turbines, the steam is condensed back to water. For the original two incinerating lines use river water from the Tees as a cooling medium, whereas in the third line, water is condensed through air cooled condenser. The cooled water is treated and reused in the boilers.|$|E
