40|$|Background Preeclampsia (PE) {{increases}} {{maternal and}} perinatal morbidity and mortality. Based on {{a multitude of}} data from randomized clinical trials, clinical practice guidelines endorse using ASA to prevent PE in women who are “at risk. ” However, data are lacking {{about the level of}} absolute risk to warrant starting ASA prophylaxis. Methods and Findings We present two approaches for objectively determining the minimum absolute risk for PE at which ASA prophylaxis is justified. The first is a new approach—the <b>minimum</b> <b>control</b> event <b>rate</b> (CERmin). The second approach uses a pre-existing concept—the minimum event rate for treatment (MERT). Here we show how the CERmin is derived, and then use the CERmin and the MERT to guide us to a reasonable risk threshold for starting a woman on ASA pro-phylaxis against PE based on clinical risk assessment. We suggest that eligible women need not be at “high risk ” for preeclampsia to warrant ASA, but rather at some modestly ele-vated absolute risk of 6 – 10 %...|$|R

40|$|The {{justification}} for the setting of rate maximums and minimums by the New Zealand Ministry of Transport for the rural road goods transport industry is reviewed {{in the light of}} the continuing need for greater efficiency in the farm servicing industries. Doubts are raised as to the validity of the original justifications in today's context. Because the rural road goods transport industry provides an unscheduled service, rate setting by Government is not clearly consistent with economic efficiency. The forces of price competition are not acting to reduce prices. Rather, farmers are paying for the luxury of service competition with rates being fixed by a third party, within a narrow range and on a cost plus criterion. It is suggested that <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> <b>controls</b> should be removed, that rates charged should more closely reflect cost differences and that controls over entry to the industry should be relaxed...|$|R

40|$|Are {{the carbon}} dioxide (CO 2) sensors in your demand {{controlled}} ventilation systems sufficiently accurate? The data from these sensors are used to automatically modulate minimum rates of outdoor air ventilation. The goal is to keep ventilation rates at or above design requirements while adjusting the ventilation rate with changes in occupancy {{in order to save}} energy. Studies of energy savings from demand controlled ventilation and of the relationship of indoor CO 2 concentrations with health and work performance provide a strong rationale for use of indoor CO 2 data to <b>control</b> <b>minimum</b> ventilation <b>rates</b> 1 - 7. However, this strategy will only be effective if, in practice, the CO 2 sensors have a reasonable accuracy. The objective of this study was; therefore, to determine if CO 2 sensor performance, in practice, is generally acceptable or problematic.

40|$|The forcing {{capabilities}} of systems composed of many actuators are analyzed in this paper. Multiactuator systems can generate higher forces in some directions than in others. Techniques are developed {{to find the}} force in the weakest direction. This corresponds to the worst-case output and {{is defined as the}} 'minimum <b>control</b> authority'. The <b>minimum</b> <b>control</b> authority is a function of three things: the actuator configuration, the actuator controller {{and the way in which}} the output of the system is limited. Three output limits are studied: (1) fuel-flow rate, (2) power, and (3) actuator output. The three corresponding actuator controllers are derived. These controllers generate the desired force while minimizing either fuel flow rate, power or actuator output. It is shown that using the optimal controller can substantially increase the <b>minimum</b> <b>control</b> authority. The techniques for calculating the <b>minimum</b> <b>control</b> authority are applied to the Gravity Probe-B spacecraft thruster system.

25|$|The <b>minimum</b> <b>control</b> speed (VMC) of an {{aircraft}} (specifically an airplane) is a V-speed that specifies the calibrated airspeed below which directional or lateral {{control of the}} aircraft {{can no longer be}} maintained, after the failure of one or more engines. The VMC only applies if at least one engine is still operative, and will depend on the stage of flight. Indeed, multiple VMCs have to be calculated for landing, air travel, and ground travel, and there are more still for aircraft with four or more engines. These are all included in the aircraft flight manual of all multi-engine aircraft.

50|$|Airworthiness Standards and Certification Specifications (§ 23.149 and § 25.149) {{require the}} {{manufacturer}} {{to determine a}} <b>minimum</b> <b>control</b> speed at which the airplane is controllable after failure of the critical engine and publish this speed in the Limitations Section of the Airplane Flight Manual. The published <b>Minimum</b> <b>Control</b> Speeds (VMC's) of the aircraft are measured while the critical engine fails or is inoperative, hence, {{the effect of the}} failure of the critical engine is included in the published VMC's. When any one of the other engines fails or is inoperative, the actual VMC that the pilot experiences in-flight will be a bit lower, which is safer, but this decrement is not documented. The critical engine {{is just one of the}} factors that influences the VMC's of the aircraft. The published VMC's are therefore safe, whatever engine fails or is inoperative. Hence, (airline) pilots should not have to know about the criticality of an engine. The critical engine is defined in Aviation Regulations for use by airplane tail design engineers for sizing the tail, and by experimental test pilots for measuring VMC's in-flight. Other factors, like bank angle and thrust, have a much greater effect on VMC's than the difference of a critical and a non-critical engine.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} awareness, {{treatment}} and <b>control</b> <b>rates</b> of diabetes and identify their associated risk factors among Beijing residents. Methods: A cross-sectional {{survey was conducted}} in 2011, using a stratified multistage cluster random sampling method to select {{a representative sample of}} 20, 242 residents in Beijing aged 18 â 79 years. Diabetes was defined as fasting blood glucose (FBG) â¥ 7. 0 Â mmol/L and/or history of diabetes and/or using insulin or hypoglycemic agents. All estimates of awareness, treatment and <b>control</b> <b>rates</b> were weighted by the 2010 Beijing Population Census data and the sampling scheme. Multivariate Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with awareness, treatment and <b>control</b> <b>rates.</b> Results: A total of 2061 (10. 3 %) participants were diagnosed as diabetes. The overall awareness, treatment and <b>control</b> <b>rate</b> among patients were 60. 9 %, 51. 3 % and 22. 4 %, respectively, while overall <b>control</b> <b>rate</b> among treated patients was 33. 8 %. These rates differed across subgroups. Women {{were more likely to be}} aware of diabetes status, receive treatment and have better glucose controlled than men (69. 5 % vs. 54. 7 % for awareness, 61. 0 % vs. 44. 3 % for treatment, and 27. 6 % vs. 18. 6 % for control, respectively). In addition, only 22. 2 % of treated patients had both FBG and hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) controlled well. Multivariate Logistic regression suggested that old age, women, higher education and family history of diabetes were associated with higher awareness, treatment and <b>control</b> <b>rates</b> (All P < 0. 05). Treated individuals living in rural (OR = 0. 67 (95 %CI: 0. 47 â 0. 96)) or with dyslipidemia (OR = 0. 63 (95 %CI: 0. 44 â 0. 91)) had a lower diabetic <b>control</b> <b>rate.</b> Conclusions: Awareness, treatment and <b>control</b> <b>rates</b> of diabetes in Beijing were still low.

40|$|Background-—Patients with {{hypertension}} {{are primarily}} treated in general practice. However, major studies {{of patients with}} hypertension are rarely based on populations from primary care. Knowledge of blood pressure (BP) <b>control</b> <b>rates</b> in patients with diabetes and/or cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), who have additional comorbidities, is lacking. We aimed to investigate the association of comorbidities with BP control using a large cohort of hypertensive patients from primary care practices. Methods and Results-—Using the Danish General Practice Database, we included 37 651 patients with hypertension from 231 general practices in Denmark. Recommended BP control was defined as BP < 140 / 90 mm Hg in general and < 130 / 80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes. The overall <b>control</b> <b>rate</b> was 33. 2 % (95 % CI: 32. 7 to 33. 7). Only 16. 5 % (95 % CI: 15. 8 to 17. 3) of patients with diabetes achieved BP <b>control,</b> whereas <b>control</b> <b>rates</b> ranged from 42. 9 % to 51. 4 % for patients with ischemic heart diseases or cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular diseases. A diagnosis of cardiac heart failure in addition to diabetes and/or CVD was associated with higher BP <b>control</b> <b>rates,</b> compared with men and women having only diabetes and/or CVD. A diagnosis of asthma in addition to diabetes and CVD was associated with higher BP <b>control</b> <b>rates</b> in men. Conclusion-—In Danish general practice, only 1 of 3 patients diagnosed with hypertension had a BP below target. BP <b>control</b> <b>rates</b> differ substantially within comorbidities.
