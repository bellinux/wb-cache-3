5|$|In December 1903, in {{an effort}} to avert another bout of Beebe's throat ailment, Hornaday sent him on an {{expedition}} to Mexico which would last until the following April.

Although the purpose of the expedition was to discover, identify and collect Mexico's birds, it has also been described as yet another honeymoon between him and Blair. Beebe's first book, titled Two Bird Lovers in <b>Mexico,</b> <b>was</b> an account of this expedition. The last chapter was written by Blair, and was an explanation of how to plan and execute a vacation in the wilderness. The book was enthusiastically well received.|$|E
