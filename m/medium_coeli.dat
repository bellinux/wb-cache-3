In most, the {{ecliptic}} {{is divided into}} houses and the ascendant (eastern horizon) marks the cusp, or beginning, of the first house, and the descendant (western horizon) marks the cusp of the seventh house.

2500|$|... The midheaven or <b>medium</b> <b>coeli</b> is {{the point}} on the {{ecliptic}} that is furthest above {{the plane of the}} horizon. For events occurring where the planes of the ecliptic and the horizon coincide, the limiting position for these points is located 90° from the ascendant. For astrologers, the midheaven traditionally indicates a person's career, status, aim in life, aspirations, public reputation, and life goal. In quadrant house systems the midheaven lies on the cusp of the 10th house of the horoscope.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{also the}} more common {{criticism}} of the whole sign and equal house method as it concerns {{the location of the}} <b>Medium</b> <b>Coeli</b> (Midheaven), the highest point in the chart. In the equal house system, the ascendant/descendant and midheaven/IC axes can vary from being perpendicular to each other (from approx. +-5 deg at most at equator to approx. +-15 degrees at Alexandria to +-90 degrees at polar circle). As a result, equal houses counted from the ascendant cannot in general place the midheaven on the tenth house cusp, where many feel it would be symbolically desirable.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the whole}} sign and equal house systems the <b>Medium</b> <b>Coeli</b> (Midheaven), {{the highest point}} in the chart, does not act as the cusp or {{starting}} point of the 10th house. Instead the MC moves around {{the top half of}} the chart, and can land anywhere in the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, depending on the latitude. [...] The MC retains its commonly agreed significations, but it doesn't act as the starting point of the 10th house, therefore in Equal house it adds extra definition and meaning to MC and the cusps involved, but always MC is same in interpretations as other house systems.|$|E

50|$|The Midheaven (MC or <b>Medium</b> <b>Coeli,</b> {{literally}} 'middle of the sky') {{is one of}} {{the most}} important angles in the birth chart. It traditionally indicates career, status, aim in life, aspirations, public reputation, and our life goal.|$|E

5000|$|The {{principle}} of House Division introduced in Sripathi Bhāva System {{is described as}} follows: [...] "In the Sripathi system the 1st house cusp is the Lagna, and the 7th house cusp is the Descendant opposite it, the 10th house cusp is at the MC (<b>Medium</b> <b>Coeli</b> or Madhya Lagna), i.e. Zenith, and the 4th house cusp is at the IC (Imum Coeli or Patala Lagna) i.e. Nadir. The four quarters divided thus should be divided into three equal parts each, and thus we find the 12 house cusps in Sripathi system. To find the Bhava Sandhis (meeting points of houses) we should divide {{the distance between the}} house cusps into halves." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{other very}} {{important}} {{angle of the}} chart is the Midheaven (also called the M.C. for the Latin <b>Medium</b> <b>coeli,</b> or [...] "middle of the sky.") The Midheaven represents the highest point in the sky reached by the Sun, or its culmination, as it crosses from one horizon to the other—the noon point in a chart which is plotted for dawn. At the Earth's equator, it is the point on the ecliptic which is directly overhead from the observer; as the observer moves north or south from the Equator, the midheaven appears to withdraw, so that from points north of the equator, the noon point of the Sun appears to lie in the southern sky, {{and south of the}} equator, it appears in the northern sky.|$|E
5000|$|In {{creating}} a horoscope the ascendant is traditionally {{placed at the}} [...] "nine o'clock" [...] position on the left-hand side of the chart wheel (though traditional rectangular chart formats need not follow this convention). During {{the course of a}} day, because of the Earth's rotation, the entire circle of the ecliptic will pass through the ascendant and will be advanced by about 1°. This movement provides us with the term rising sign, which is the sign of the zodiac rising over the eastern horizon at the moment of birth. The point on the ecliptic that is furthest above the plane of the horizon at the time is called the Midheaven, or <b>medium</b> <b>coeli</b> (M.C.), placed at the [...] "twelve o'clock position" [...] effectively where the Sun would be if the birth time was midday.|$|E
50|$|This is {{also the}} more common {{criticism}} of the whole sign and equal house method as it concerns {{the location of the}} <b>Medium</b> <b>Coeli</b> (Midheaven), the highest point in the chart. In the equal house system, the ascendant/descendant and midheaven/IC axes can vary from being perpendicular to each other (from approx. +-5 deg at most at equator to approx. +-15 degrees at Alexandria to +-90 degrees at polar circle). As a result, equal houses counted from the ascendant cannot in general place the midheaven on the tenth house cusp, where many feel it would be symbolically desirable. Since this point is associated with ambition, career, and public image, the argument is that the Midheaven, therefore, must be the cusp of the similar tenth house. It has also been linked by extension with Capricorn (the tenth sign of the zodiac). Equal house system always takes MC to be first and foremost THE most important indicator of career, but 10th house cusp is simple like a weaker 2nd MC cusp and would be taken into account, but not at the expense of MC.Because the Whole Sign and Equal House system do take the Midheaven into account, but relies on the location of the Ascendant, it can be found anywhere between the 8th and 11th houses.|$|E
