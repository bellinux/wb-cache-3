5|$|Not all of Diocletian's {{plans were}} successful: the Edict on <b>Maximum</b> <b>Prices</b> (301), {{his attempt to}} curb {{inflation}} via price controls, was counterproductive and quickly ignored. Although effective while he ruled, Diocletian's tetrarchic system collapsed after his abdication under the competing dynastic claims of Maxentius and Constantine, sons of Maximian and Constantius respectively. The Diocletianic Persecution (303–11), the empire's last, largest, and bloodiest official persecution of Christianity, did not destroy the empire's Christian community; indeed, after 324, Christianity became the empire's preferred religion under its first Christian emperor, Constantine.|$|E
5|$|The Edict on <b>Maximum</b> <b>Prices</b> (Edictum De Pretiis Rerum Venalium) {{was issued}} {{two to three}} months after the coinage edict, somewhere between 20 November and 10 December 301. The best-preserved Latin {{inscription}} surviving from the Greek East, the edict survives in many versions, on materials as varied as wood, papyrus, and stone. In the edict, Diocletian declared that the current pricing crisis resulted from the unchecked greed of merchants, and had resulted in turmoil for the mass of common citizens. The language of the edict calls on the people's memory of their benevolent leaders, and exhorts them to enforce the provisions of the edict, and thereby restore perfection to the world. The edict goes on to list in detail over one thousand goods and accompanying retail prices not to be exceeded. Penalties are laid out for various pricing transgressions.|$|E

The attempt to establish <b>maximum</b> <b>prices</b> was an exercise in futility as <b>maximum</b> <b>prices</b> were impossible to enforce. The Edict was reckoned in terms of denarii, although no such coin had been struck for over 50 years (it is believed that the bronze follis was valued at 12.5 denarii).

At the time the forest industry was until 1957 organized through a price regulation mechanism, with <b>maximum</b> <b>prices</b> for lumber set by the government. Prices were set through negotiations between forest owner associations, organized by drainage system, and the industry.|$|E

The Historia Augusta claims that the emperor Elagabalus was the first Roman to wear garments of pure silk (holoserica) as opposed to the usual silk/cotton blends (subserica); this is presented as further evidence of his notorious decadence. Moral dimensions aside, Roman importation and expenditure on silk represented a significant, inflationary drain on Rome's gold and silver coinage, to the benefit of foreign traders and loss to the empire. Diocletian's Edict on <b>Maximum</b> <b>Prices</b> of 301 AD set the price of one kilo of raw silk at 4,000 gold coins.|$|E
500|$|John Dudley also {{strove to}} {{alleviate}} the social situation. The 1547 [...] "Act for the Punishment of Vagabonds", which had enacted that any unemployed man found loitering was to be branded and given to the [...] "presentor" [...] as a slave, was abolished as too harsh in 1550. In 1552 Northumberland pushed a novel Poor Law through parliament which provided for weekly parish-based collections for the [...] "relief of the poor". Parishes were to register their needy inhabitants {{as well as the}} amounts people agreed to give for them, while unwilling contributors were to be [...] "induced" [...] by the parson and, if need be, by the bishop. The years 1549–1551 saw poor harvests and, accordingly, soaring food prices. Dudley tried to intervene against the malpractices of middlemen by official searches for hidden corn and by fixing <b>maximum</b> <b>prices</b> for grain, meat, and other victuals. However, the set prices were so unrealisitic that farmers stopped to sell their produce at the open market and the regulations had to be rescinded. The regime's agrarian policy, while giving landlords much freedom to enclose common land, also distinguished between different forms of enclosure. Landlords guilty of illegal enclosures were increasingly prosecuted.|$|E

This debate probably led Burke to editing his memorandum, as there appeared a notice that Burke would soon publish a letter on the subject to the Secretary of the Board of Agriculture, Arthur Young; but he failed to complete it. These fragments were inserted into the memorandum after his death and published posthumously in 1800 as, Thoughts and Details on Scarcity.

2500|$|By May 1996, Sound on Sound was {{reporting}} that {{the popularity of the}} 808 had started to decline, with the rarer TR-909 taking its place as [...] "the dance floor drum machine to use." [...] This is thought to have arisen for a number of reasons: the 909 gives more control over the drum sounds, has better programming and includes MIDI as standard.

2500|$|Natural gas is {{typically}} produced {{in association with}} oil from wells. [...] Wells can also be drilled into geological formations that have mostly gas and very little oil. [...] In the infancy of the oil industry, any natural gas produced from oil wells was burned off. Later, states passed [...] conservation laws which required the gas to be captured and transported in pipelines for useful purposes. [...] In order to prevent any gaps in the natural gas regulation when natural gas flows in interstate commerce, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Act of 1938. [...] That law required that companies must obtain from the Federal Power Commission (FPC) a [...] "certificate of public convenience and necessity" [...] (certificate) before making any sale for resale natural gas in interstate commerce. The FPC set the <b>maximum</b> <b>prices</b> charged for gas sold under a certificate. For example, if gas flowed from a well in Texas through a pipeline to New York where it was sold to a gas distribution company, the sale by the pipeline to the distributor would need a certificate. [...] The final sale to retail customers were exempt from the law. [...] Although the Natural Gas Act regulated both the transportation and sale of gas in interstate commerce, the [...] "production and gathering" [...] of gas was exempt from federal regulation, although potentially subject to state control. [...] Production means bringing the gas {{out of the ground}} to a pipe {{at the top of the}} wellhead. [...] Gathering refers to the flow of gas through low pressure lines to the center of a gas field where the gas is treated and compressed to bring it up to the high pressures used in long-distance pipelines.|$|E

30|$|Results in the OLS model {{show that}} the {{initially}} proposed price positively affects the <b>maximum</b> <b>price</b> that a respondent {{is willing to pay}} for the program. An increase of 10, 000 VND in the initial <b>price</b> on the <b>maximum</b> <b>price</b> is 5, 751 VND. The results also show that only exogenous variables presenting social-economic and demographic characteristics of household affect the <b>maximum</b> <b>price</b> that a respondent votes for the GPP. These statistically significant variables are Income (household income), Age (respondent’s age), Edu (respondent’s education status), and Career (respondent’s career). Among respondents who demand for groundwater protection, as a monthly household income increases 100, 000 VND, each resident is willing to contribute 890 VND more for the groundwater protection project. If the age or education of sample resident increases 1  year, he or she can pay the <b>maximum</b> <b>price</b> of about 1, 000 VND or 4, 360 VND, respectively.
