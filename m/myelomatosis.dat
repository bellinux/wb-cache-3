A larger number showed myeloma protein with β-globulin mobility and hypogammaglobulinaemia than with γ-globulin mobility. As in the Caucasians the disease is more common in men than in women and the age incidence in both seems to be the same. Combined serum and urinary electrophoresis was diagnostic in every case, and examination of the urine for Bence-Jones protein by electrophoresis yielded more consistent findings than the classical heat test.

40|$|Summary. -Twenty-four {{untreated}} {{patients with}} <b>myelomatosis</b> were studied {{in order to}} characterize their anaemia, using standard haematological and ferrokinetic techniques, together with measurements of circulating erythropoietin, erythropoietin sensitivity of marrow cultures and in vitro measurements of haem synthesis. There is a reduction in total erythroid output by the marrow, together with a minor degree of plasma expansion. In patients with normal renal function there is an appropriate increase in erythropoietin in response to anaemia, but {{in a few cases}} there may be reduced response of CFU-E to the hormone in vitro. No abnormality of iron status or haem synthesis was found. One case of folate deficiency was discovered. ANAEMIA IS COMMON in patients with <b>myelomatosis.</b> Nearly half the patients entering the third MRC <b>myelomatosis</b> trial had an initial haemoglobin concentration of 10 g/dl or less (MRC Working Party, 1980 a).

40|$|In {{two cases}} of <b>myelomatosis</b> relapse was {{accompanied}} {{by the development of}} bulky extramedullary plasma cell tumours, which created serious management problems. In both cases the histology was of a poorly differentiated plasmacytoid tumour with frequent mitoses. In one case paraprotein had completely disappeared from the serum and urine after six months' treatment with melphalan alone but did not correlate with improved survival. It is concluded that extramedullary spread of <b>myelomatosis</b> in the form of bulky tumour deposits is a rare and ominous mode of tumour progression or relapse. Rises in serum and urinary paraprotein concentrations are not the inevitable signs of relapse...|$|E
40|$|<b>MYELOMATOSIS</b> {{results from}} the {{abnormal}} proliferation of plasma cells derived from reticulum cells, usually within the bone marrow but occasionally from those outside. Various clinical manifestations may arise. In a review of 188 cases of <b>myelomatosis,</b> Innes and Newall (1961) classified them into 4 main groups: 1. Solitary myeloma, where a bone focus is present without disease elsewhere; 2. Multiple myeloma, where there are scattered foci of plasma cell proliferation in several or many bones; 3. Diffuse <b>myelomatosis,</b> {{where there is a}} diffuse infiltration of the bone marrow by plasma cells without discrete tumour formation, and 4. Extramedullary plasmacytoma, the rarest group, where the primary focus commences in reticulum cells outside the bone marrow. They considered these different manifestations were the result of the same basic pathological process. Others have suggested that extramedullary plasmacytoma be considered a separate entity because of the better prognosis and usual absence of haematological, biochemical and radiological changes found in <b>myelomatosis</b> (Dolin and Dewar, 1956; Martinson and Pulvertaft, 1967). It is recognised, however, that extramedullary plasmacytoma, like solitary myeloma, may develop generalised manifestations, but it is not realised how frequently extramedullary lesions occur in those with multiple myeloma. Previous reports have described soft tissue masses in multiple myeloma (Gordon and Churg, 1949; Hayes, Bennett and Heck, 1952; Fraser, Schuh and Mullen, 1966) and here a patient is described in whom several tumour masses developed late in the disease. The first of these occurred in the breast, which is an unusual site...|$|E

40|$|Multiple myeloma (MM) is {{characterized}} by the accumu-lation of monoclonal plasma cells [12], with common nervous system involvement including peripheral neurop-athy and epidural compression [2]. In contrast, intrapa-renchymal lesions and infiltration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and leptomeninges (meningeal <b>myelomatosis)</b> are rare; CSF infiltration occurs in 1 % of MM patients [4], which is less common than in solid tumours (1 – 5 %) and much less than in lymphoma and leukaemia (5 – 15 %) [1, 7]. We present a MM patient with progressive and stepwise, multifocal neurological symptoms.

40|$|In {{the present}} study {{evidence}} is provided that neoplastic B cells from the blood from four of 24 patients with <b>myelomatosis</b> were activated selectively with polyclonal B cell mitogens. In three of these patients the activated cells produced light chains without heavy chains; of these, two patients had IgGK paraproteins and one had free lambda light chain disease. The ratio of kappa-expressing to lambda-expressing B cells in the initial blood B cell preparations was within the range for healthy controls for all four patients where neoplastic B cells were selectively activated. It is concluded that in some patients with <b>myelomatosis</b> the neoplastic clone is a mosaic of: (1) cells capable of synthesizing both light and heavy chains with (2) cells producing light chains only...|$|E
40|$|Summary In the Medical Research Council's lVth {{trial in}} <b>Myelomatosis</b> the {{possible}} benefit of adding vincristine to {{first line treatment}} with intermittent melphalan and prednisone has been assessed.

A total of 268 patients reached plateau phase on first line therapy. Of these 226 patients were rerandomised either to continue receiving first line therapy for a further year or to cease therapy. At the present time there is a slight but not significant survival advantage in the group which received no further treatment on reaching plateau.

40|$|In {{a patient}} with <b>myelomatosis</b> and {{persistent}} increase of total serum calcium but without clinical hypercalcemic symptoms, the serum ionized calcium was normal. In contrast, ionized calcium was elevated in all serums from 14 other patients with hypercalcemic <b>myelomatosis.</b> The increased nonionized serum calcium in our patient was explained {{by the presence of}} a calcium-binding IgG myeloma globulin. Hypercalcemia caused by calcium-binding myeloma globulins {{does not seem to have}} been described earlier. T H E PATHOPHYSIOLOGY of hypercalcemia in myelo-matosis is a matter of debate. The most probable mechanisms are, essentially, an increased calcium in-flux to the intravascular compartment from the skele-ton because of osteolysis or immobilization of the pa-tient, or decreased urinary calcium excretion caused by renal disease. Calcium binding to myeloma pro-teins has also been invoked, but clinical and biochem-ical data supporting this theory seem to be lacking (1 - 3). We present here a case of hypercalcemia in <b>myelomatosis,</b> in which clinical and biochemical studies show the presence of a calcium-binding myeloma globulin. Case Report The patient (A. L.) is a 62 -year-old woman. She was essentially healthy until about 1960, when she began to complain of pain in hands, shoulders, knees, and ankles. Joint swelling was sometimes present.

40|$|The {{filterable}} {{agent that}} will be described here produces in chickens leukosis of types that hitherto have not been successfully transmitted, namely lymphomatosis and <b>myelomatosis,</b> sometimes with leukemia and sometimes with tumor formation. In many chickens inoculated with this strain leukosis {{was associated with the}} formation of tumors that histologically resembled endothelioma. Infiltration of nerves often occurred among chickens inoculated with this strain, and in a few birds paresis or paralysis of legs or wings was noted. Thus this transmissible strain possesses characteristics ascribed to three different types of filterable agents; namely, (a) the agent of Ellermann and Bang (1) that causes leukosis of chickens; (b) the agents of Rous that stimulate connective tissues of chickens to neoplastic growth and may cause endothelioma (Begg (2)); and (c) the agent of Pappenheimer, Dunn, and Cone (3) that produces fowl paralysis. In this article evidence will be presented to show that lymphomatosis, <b>myelomatosis,</b> endothelioma, and fowl paralysis occurring among the passages of this strain are caused by filterable agents. In the paper that follows, the relationship of these diseases and the anatomical lesions associated with them will be discussed. The available evidence is in favor of the assumption that a single agent can produce lymphomatosis, with or without paralysis, <b>myelomatosis,</b> and endothelioma. * This investigation has been supported by a Fund for the Study of Leukemia...|$|E

40|$|Summary. -In a {{longitudinal}} study {{of the evolution of}} serum p 2 -microglobulin (p 2 -m) levels in 37 patients with <b>myelomatosis,</b> those patients with a level of 4 mg/l had a median survival of 15 months. The p 2 -m appeared to be independent of the level of the paraprotein and its class, as seen in a vertical study of 129 patients. Analysis of the influence of a rising serum creatinine on the serum p 2 -im indicates that p 2 -rm production is excessive in advanced disease with or without renal failure. Practical application of the measurement of serum p 2 -m in the stratification and monitoring of patients is suggested.

40|$|In {{order to}} define the {{relative}} importance of renal failure and increased bone resorption in the hypercalcaemia of <b>myelomatosis</b> 22 untreated patients were studied, of whom 12 were hypercalcaemic. Most patients had malabsorption of radiocalcium from the gastrointestinal tract and evidence of increased bone resorption as assessed by fasting urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine ratio. The mean OHPr/Cr ratio, however, was similar in patients with and without hypercalcaemia. Renal failure and Bence Jones proteinuria occurred more frequently in the hypercalcaemic patients. In four patients with hypercalcaemia there was an increase in OHPr/Cr after saline infusion accompanied by an improvement in renal function and hypercalcaemia. Mithramycin given to the same patients further reduced hypercalcaemia, presumably by inhibiting bone resorption. It was concluded that the hypercalcaemia of <b>myelomatosis</b> is due to the combination of renal failure and increased bone resorption, but that the OHPr/Cr ratio in the untreated state is a poor indicator of the degree of bone resorption in hypercalcaemic patients...|$|E

Systemic amyloid is found in one in 375 of patients with carcinoma and in only a single patient among 1, 500 'control cases'. Renal carcinoma accounts for one-quarter of all carcinomas associated with systemic amyloid. The other carcinomas originate in a variety of organs. In <b>myelomatosis,</b> amyloid may be found in the tumour deposits. In Hodgkin's disease and in lymphosarcoma there appears to be greater amyloid deposition in neoplastic tissue than hitherto realized. The carcinomas provide a striking example of topographical association of amyloid and tumour, the two being closely related in six of seven cases. Systemic amyloidosis associated with malignant disease has received some attention in the recent literature but many of the problems arising from the association remain unsolved. This investigation was undertaken in an attempt to clarify some of the controversial points. We are not concerned here with amyloid deposited purely locally within tumours, a remarkable occurrence in a special type of thyroid carcinoma (Hazard, Hawk, and Crile, 1959), in pancreatic insulinomas (Porta, Yerry, and Scott, 1962), and in certain calcifying odontogenic tumour...|$|E

40|$|Serum beta 2 -microglobulin (beta 2 -m) is {{frequently}} increased {{in patients with}} <b>myelomatosis.</b> The possibility that it could provide a biochemical indicator of prognosis was tested {{in a group of}} 129 patients from 3 centres, all serum analyses being carried out in one laboratory by radioimmunoassay. A strong association between the pretreatment serum beta 2 -m level and survival was demonstrated, the data for the 2 main subgroups being very similar. In further detailed analyses of 64 patients, serum beta 2 -m proved to be a stronger indicator of prognosis than current "standard" clinical and laboratory data, including stage determined by the method of Durie and Salmon and the combination of haemoglobin level and blood urea. The association between serum beta 2 -m and survival remained close after treatment as indicated by the findings at one year. The serum beta 2 -m in myeloma reflects the tumour mass and also reduced glomerular filtration when renal failure supervenes.

40|$|Plasma cell myeloma of bone {{may present}} {{initially}} with multiple lesions or with an apparently solitary lesion. Multiple myeloma runs its natural course {{in a period}} varying from {{a few months to}} an average of two years after diagnosis (Christopherson and Miller 1950), with fatal termination regardless of treatment. Solitary myelomas are unpredictable in their behaviour; they may remain localised for several years or they may disseminate. In 1923 Shaw reported the first acceptable case of solitary myeloma, and since then a number of cases have appeared in the medical literature, though the majority lack sufficient detail to support the diagnosis. As yet, there is no agreement among pathologists as to whether the so-called “ solitary myeloma “ should be considered as a form of <b>myelomatosis</b> or as an unrelated benign lesion (Johnson and Meador 1951). Willis (1941) and Raven and Willis (1949) were satisfied that solitary myeloma of bone is an entity distinct from multiple <b>myelomatosis,</b> but they stressed that a myeloma can only be accepted as a truly solitary lesion if the radiographic examination of the skeleton fails to reveal other deposits for at least one year after the original diagnosis.
