50|$|A common {{application}} of the inverse <b>Mills</b> <b>ratio</b> (sometimes also called 'selection hazard') arises in regression analysis {{to take account of}} a possible selection bias. If a dependent variable is censored (i.e., not for all observations a positive outcome is observed) it causes a concentration of observations at zero values. This problem was first acknowledged by Tobin (1958), who showed that if this is not taken into consideration in the estimation procedure, an ordinary least squares estimation (OLS) will produce biased parameter estimates. With censored dependent variables there is a violation of the Gauss-Markov assumption of zero correlation between independent variables and the error term.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{influence}} of roller mill gap and single kernel properties of wheat {{on the energy}} requirements of first–break grinding was studied. Multiple linear regression models for energy per unit mass (EM), new specific surface area (ANSS, in log scale), and specific energy (EA = EM /ANSS) were developed based on milling data from six wheat classes ground at five roll gaps with an experimental roller mill. The models, which were functions of roll gap, single kernel properties, and wheat class as a classification variable, explained most of the variability in the experimental data. Roll gap and single kernel hardness had the greatest influence on EM, ANSS, and EA. <b>Milling</b> <b>ratio,</b> a variable that combined single kernel size and roll gap, reduced some collinearities among single kernel properties and isolated the effect of single kernel mass from that of single kernel size.
