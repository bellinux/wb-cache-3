50|$|Like other <b>mackerels,</b> the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel's</b> {{reproduction}} is oviparous. Its reproductive cycle {{is divided into}} three distinct stages, the pre-reproductive, reproductive, and post-reproductive. The pre-reproductive stages occurs from January to April and the post-reproductive stage occurs from September to December. During these periods, the gonads are much smaller than the reproductive stage. Mating occurs in the summer months from May to August, during which testes and ovaries grow significantly in size. The ovaries become a dark orange color and eggs are visible on the surface. Embryonic development occurs in 24-26 hours. Eggs are pelagic and 0.71 - 0.92 mm in length. Sexual maturity is reached at 2 years of age and around 16 cm in length for both males and females.|$|R
40|$|<b>Horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> stock {{identification}} {{was carried}} out {{with the aim of}} obtaining management units that were meaningful biological entities and thus improving the management of the resource. The stock identification was made by integrating both established and innovative approaches such as genetic markers (allozymes, mitochondrial DNA, microsatellite DNA and SSCP on nuclear DNA), morphometry, parasites as biological tags, and life history traits (growth, reproduction and distribution), within the EU-funded HOMSIR project. The sampling covered almost the whole distribution range of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> through 20 sampling localities in Northeast Atlantic and <b>Mediterranean</b> Sea. <b>Horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> showed low levels of genetic differentiation, stable genetic structure over the study time and high levels of genetic variability. However, several approaches (morphometrics and parasites) support the separation between the Atlantic Ocean and the <b>Mediterranean</b> Sea in <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> populations, although the most western Mediterranean area could also be mixed with the Atlantic populations. In the Northeast Atlantic, various stocks can be distinguished mainly based on morphometrics, parasites and life history traits: a "southern" stock is distributed along the West Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula south to Cape Finisterre (NW Spain); a "western" stock, along the west coast of Europe from Cape Finisterre to Norway and the "North Sea" stock. These results implied the revision of the boundaries of the southern and western stocks as previously defined. Results also suggested that adult <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> could migrate through different areas following the west coasts in the Northeast Atlantic (i. e. between Celtic Seas and northern North Sea). <b>Horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> from the Mauritanian coast is distinguished by its high growth rate and high batch fecundity. Based on the results from morphometric analysis and the use of parasites as biological tags, the <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> population in the Mediterranean Sea is sub-structured into at least three main areas: western, central and eastern Mediterranean. In this contribution, we have integrated the fundamental findings of different approaches showing that the holistic approach is the appropriate way to identify <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> stocks, on covering multiple aspects of the biology of the species and reducing the type I error in stock identification.

40|$|The seafood {{processing}} industry {{has to deal}} with the considerable intrinsic variability that occurs within a population of harvested fish. Processors need to know the nature of the raw material before the techniques of chilling, freezing, smoking or canning can be correctly applied. The aim of this work was to determine the physicochemical parameters and microbiological quality of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus mediterraneus) muscle during the year and the consequent advantages or disadvantages in processing the raw material. The seasonal intrinsic variability of the North Aegean Sea <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (T. mediterraneus) population have been studied from monthly samples taken from the Greek purse-seine fishery over a four-year period (2001 - 2005). The length and weight frequency distributions differed significantly by season, the highest mean lengths and weights attained in spring and the lowest in autumn. Length-weight relationships were determined on a monthly and annual basis and there were found monthly variations on the allometry coefficient. The differences between the coefficient obtained for annual data and the coefficients for each month were not significant in 50 % of the cases. The b values obtained both in this study and some of the previously reported in the Mediterranean Sea and other Greek waters were compared, showing basic similarities and minor spatial variation. The seasonal cycle in <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> condition appears {{to be related to the}} reproductive cycle of the fish. Values of muscle yield ranged between 23. 33 % and 33. 07 % (mean value: 28. 48 Â± 2. 49 %), but variations within seasons were not significant. A total of 360 samples were examined (30 samples per month) during two years (November 2001 - November 2003) in order to determine the chemical composition and the microbiological quality of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus mediterraneus) muscle during the year. Fish were caught in the coastal waters of Chalkidiki peninsula (North Greece). Proximate composition of the muscle during the year resulted in: water 76. 8 Â± 1. 39 %, proteins 20. 3 Â± 0. 68 %, fat 1. 3 Â± 1. 08 % and ash 1. 5 Â± 0. 08 %. In March, April and May an increase in fat content of the muscle (2. 5 %, 2. 8 % and 2. 1 % respectively) and a decrease in water content of the muscle (below 75. 9 %) were observed. On the contrary, fat content showed a decrease in September and October (0. 4 % and 0. 6 % respectively), while water content of the muscle increased during these months (78. 2 % and 77. 6 % respectively). The protein content of the muscle remained at high values, while the ash content was almost constant during the year. The mean value of muscle pH was 6. 38 Â± 0. 16; extreme values (7) of muscle pH were not observed. Total Viable Bacteria, Shewanella putrefaciens and Pseudomonas spp. were used as microbial indices to evaluate the microbiological quality of the muscle. Mean counts of Total Viable Bacteria, Shewanella putrefaciens and Pseudomonas spp. during the year were: 4. 01 Â± 0. 38 log 10 cfu/g, 2. 37 Â± 0. 43 log 10 cfu/g and 3. 34 Â± 0. 27 log 10 cfu/g respectively. The variations of the values within seasons are minimal and significant homogeneity in the chemical composition and microbiological quality of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> muscle is observed. This is an important advantage in processing of the raw material. Sensory, physicÎ¿chemical and microbiological analyses were carried out on <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> and blue jack mackerel in order to determine quality changes during storage in ice. Sensory results indicated that whole <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> and blue jack mackerel used in this trial had a shelf-life of 10 and 7 days respectively. Fishtester and Fishchecker measurements showed that the quality of blue jack mackerel had deteriorated more rapidly. The pH of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> muscle was consistently lower than the pH of blue jack mackerel muscle during the storage period. The pH values of both species muscle increased gradually with time and pH value equal to 7 had almost coincided with the end of shelf-life. Bacterial loads in both fish species muscle remained rather low prior to day 10 (< 6 log 10 cfu/g). The longer shelf-life of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> as determined by sensory evaluation was not reflected in microbiological results suggesting that the difference was due to lower rate of autolysis rather than to reduced microbial activity. The quality changes of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> muscle kept under vacuum during 20 months of frozen storage at - 18 Â°C were studied. Analyses included physicochemical and chemical changes, lipid hydrolysis and oxidation damage, and sensory acceptance. Attribute scores (appearance, texture, odor, flavor) were found to be at a level of acceptance during almost 16 months. Water holding capacity decreased significantly over the first eight months of frozen storage while pH values did not lead to good correlation with the storage time. Lipid hydrolysis developed gradually up to 8 months while free fatty acids remained relative constant between 10 and 18 months [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Total mercury {{concentrations}} were determined in different {{size classes of}} two pelagic fish species of great commercial importance, horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) and <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus mediterraneus), to evaluate the relationship between total mercury concentration and fish size and to determine whether any differences might affect the quantitative assessment of mercury exposure for consumers. Mercury concentrations in horse mackerel and in <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> were between 0. 16 and 2. 41 microg g(- 1) of weight wet (mean, 0. 68 microg g(- 1)) and between 0. 09 and 1. 62 microg g(- 1) (mean, 0. 51 microg g(- 1)), respectively. The regression curves revealed {{a significant relationship between}} mercury concentration and fish size (length and weight) for both species. Concentrations exceeding the proposed limit for human consumption were observed in 33. 3 % of the samples of both species and were associated with larger specimens. The consumption of the larger specimens could lead to an increase in mercury exposure for consumers. Estimated weekly intakes, calculated on the basis of concentrations relative to each size class, revealed a high exposure associated with the consumption of fish larger than 30 cm (horse mackerel, 11. 63 to 20. 16 microg/kg of body weight; <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel,</b> 5. 86 to 13. 55 microg/kg of body weight).

40|$|A methodological {{approach}} for modelling the occurrence patterns of species {{for the purpose}} of fisheries management is proposed here. The presence/absence of the species is modelled with a hierarchical Bayesian spatial model using the geographical and environmental characteristics of each fishing location.

Bayesian inference on the parameters and prediction of presence/absence in new locations (Bayesian kriging) are made by considering the model as a latent Gaussian model, which allows the use of the integrated nested Laplace approximation () software (which has been seen to be quite a bit faster than the well-known MCMC methods). In particular, the spatial effect has been implemented with the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach.

40|$|Small {{pelagic fish}} are {{the link between}} planktonic {{production}} and higher trophic levels.

In this study, we have investigated the diet, prey preference, trophic niche breadth and diet overlap of the 8 major small pelagic species (anchovy, sardine, sprat, Atlantic and <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel,</b> bogue, Atlantic mackerel and Atlantic chub mackerel) inhabiting the Bay of Biscay. Results indicate that all fish feed mainly on calanoid copepods, incorporating larger prey like euphausiids and decapods to complete their diet. Differences in ingested prey diversity seem to be more limited by the available zooplankton at sea than by a specific diet preference by fish species, resulting in an overall high diet overlap, especially within clupeids but also between clupeids and other (larger) predator species. Consumption estimations for different prey groups could therefore determine whether such a large diet overlap between small pelagic fish, together with spatial co-occurrence, results in competition or enhances the effects of intraguild predation, which is important in terms of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management...|$|E
