40|$|The {{mainline}} of {{air transportation}} {{is expected to}} continue {{to be based on the}} <b>medium</b> to long <b>haul</b> turbine powered subsonic aircraft. With greater emphasis on energy conservation, there will be considerable interest in making additional progress in propulsion system efficiency. Continued improvement in turbofan engines is expected to occur, but there may be a less conventional approach in the background. Opportunities for expanding short haul air services will certainly materialize. The outlook for supersonic air transport is less clear because of complex political and economic factors...|$|R

The international branch for the commercialisation of these worldwide medical repatriations is “European Air Ambulance”.|$|R
50|$|Holt's track-type {{tractors}} {{played a}} support role in World War I. Even before the U.S. formally entered WWI, Holt had shipped 1,200 tractors to England, France and Russia for agricultural purposes. These governments, however, sent the tractors {{directly to the}} battlefront where the military put them to work hauling artillery and supplies. When World War I broke out, the British War Office ordered a Holt tractor and put it through trials at Aldershot. The War Office was suitably impressed and chose it as a gun-tractor. Over the next four years, the Holt tractor became a major artillery tractor, mainly used to <b>haul</b> <b>medium</b> guns like the 6-inch howitzer, the 60-pounder, and later the 9.2-inch howitzer.|$|R

25|$|Amtrak is {{no longer}} {{required}} by law to operate a national route system, but it is encouraged to do so. Amtrak has presence in 46 of the 48 contiguous states (lacking Wyoming and South Dakota). Amtrak services fall into three groups: short-haul service on the Northeast Corridor, state-supported short haul service outside the Northeast Corridor, and long-distance service known within Amtrak as the National Network. Amtrak receives federal funding {{for the vast majority of}} its operations including the central spine of the Northeast Corridor between Boston and Washington DC as well as for its National long distance routes. In addition to the federally funded routes, Amtrak partners with transportation agencies in 18 states to operate other short and <b>medium</b> <b>haul</b> routes outside of the Northeast Corridor, some of which connect to it or are extensions off of it. In addition to its inter-city services, Amtrak also operates commuter services for three state agencies including MARC in Maryland, Shore Line East in Connecticut, and Metrolink in California.|$|E

5000|$|Knight began {{transporting}} general {{commodities from}} Phoenix, Arizona, to Los Angeles, California. Starting {{with just a}} handful of trucks and one service center in Phoenix, Arizona, the company now runs a fleet of over 4,000 tractors and more than 8,700 trailers (dry, refrigerated, and brokerage). Revenues have grown from over 13 million in 1991 to over $866 million in 2011, with operating ratios at or near 80% year after year. They have grown from a few associates to more than 4,000, and from a family-owned business to a publicly held company trading on the New York Stock Exchange (KNX) in 1994. [...] Knight engages in the transportation of general commodities in the United States. It provides asset-based dry van truckload and temperature controlled truckload carrier services primarily to short to <b>medium</b> lengths of <b>haul.</b> The company also offers non-asset-based brokerage services. As of September 24, 2007, the company operates 27 regional dry van service centers, 6 regional temperature controlled service centers, 12 brokerage service centers, and 13 truck and trailer sales locations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{preferred}} option by {{the airport}} company {{for increasing the}} capacity of the existing runways is by introducing independent operations. This can be achieved by adding a 300m extension to the north-eastern end of the main runway 20/02 which would give it a total length of 3,600m. When the prevailing north-easterly winds are blowing this would allow for intersection departures for most aircraft types while other aircraft land on runway 11. Large wide body aircraft would still have to use the full length of the runway.The runway 11/29 would be widened to 45m and extended by 250m to the north-west into the Harewood golf course; the airport has purchased land from the club already. This would increase the runway length to 1981 metres and is estimated to cost $12 million. As presently some Tasman and Pacific Island flights are unable to take off fully loaded in Nor-west wind conditions. [...] A runway end safety area (RESA) will be added to each end to make it comply with ICAO standards. Eventually all the runways will have a RESA. Also Runway 11/29 may be lengthened up to 2,000m to provide for enhanced take-off capability for Code D (Boeing 767-sized aircraft) and Code E (Boeing 777, Boeing 787, Airbus A350) aircraft flying on <b>medium</b> and long <b>haul</b> routes in northwest wind operational conditions. When completed with peak operation periods both runways will be used simultaneously.Statistics indicated that Runway 02 was used 70% of the time, Runway 20 at 20%, Runway 29 at 8% and Runway 11 (predominantly for landings) at 2% of the time.|$|R
2500|$|Economy, Air France's {{economy class}} long haul product, {{features}} seats that recline up to 118°. The current long-haul Economy seat, which debuted on the Boeing 777-300ER, includes winged headrests, a personal telephone, and a touchscreen TV monitor with AVOD Interactive Entertainment System {{which have been}} installed on all of Air France's long haul fleet. On long haul flights, a menu is presented {{with a choice of}} two meals. Short and <b>medium</b> <b>haul</b> Economy services are operated by Airbus A320 family aircraft with different seating arrangements. Air France {{is one of the few}} airlines who features winged headrests on short to <b>medium</b> <b>haul</b> aircraft in both classes. On short haul flights a snack is served, while on <b>medium</b> <b>haul</b> flights a three course cold meal is served. Free alcoholic beverages are available on all flights, including champagne. On most aircraft, Air France offers extra legroom seats in economy called Seat Plus. These seats are located in the economy class exit rows and other rows depending on the plane, as well as the economy seats on the 747's upper deck, offering at least 4" [...] more seat pitch(36" [...] versus the usual 32" [...] in standard economy seats), the 747's Seat Plus section also provides an extra half-inch of seat width. Seat Plus prices vary by flight time, but it is free to elites and passengers with a full fare economy ticket.|$|E
2500|$|The {{company is}} {{planning}} to introduce new aircraft. The new Airbus A320neo family [...] has been proposed for short to <b>medium</b> <b>haul,</b> while the Airbus A350, the Boeing 777-300ER, and the Boeing 777X are being considered to expand the long-haul fleet.

2500|$|Eddington {{joined the}} Swire Group in 1979, working for its {{subsidiary}} Cathay Pacific, before being appointed Managing Director in 1992. Continuing {{his association with}} the airline industry; News Limited, subsidiary of News Corporation, appointed Eddington Chairman of Ansett Australia in January 1997, four years before the airline failed. News Corp had taken [...] control of the airline with TNT in 1979. Eddington was appointed Deputy Chairman of News Limited in September 1998. He was further promoted to the News Corporation board in September 1999. In a timely manoeuvre, News Corporation sold off Ansett; the airline eventually became insolvent in 2001 {{partly as a result}} of the overall difficulties in the airline industry following the 9/11 terror attacks. Eddington managed to escape blame for the poor financial state of the airline, apparently aided by his board membership of News Corporation, as others were loath to criticise him publicly. The blame for the collapse has tended to be worn by the Air New Zealand management, who bought the airline from News Corporation in 2000 without significant experience in managing large point-to-point short and <b>medium</b> <b>haul</b> domestic networks. Prior to Ansett's placement into Administration by the Air New Zealand Management, Eddington had successfully met most targets to turn Ansett's misfortune around and some critics believe the airline was not technically insolvent after all.|$|E
40|$|International {{tourism is}} {{a major source of}} export {{receipts}} for many countries worldwide. Although it is not yet {{one of the most important}} industries in Taiwan (or the Republic of China), an island in East Asia off the coast of mainland China (or the People’s Republic of China), the leading tourism source countries for Taiwan are Japan, followed by USA, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, UK, Germany and Australia. These countries reflect short, <b>medium</b> and long <b>haul</b> tourist destinations. Although the People’s Republic of China and Hong Kong are large sources of tourism to Taiwan, the political situation is such that tourists from these two sources to Taiwan are reported as domestic tourists. Daily data from 1 January 1990 to 30 June 2007 are obtained from the National Immigration Agency of Taiwan. The Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) model is used to capture long memory properties in the data. In comparison with the HAR(1) model, the estimated asymmetry coefficients for GJR(1, 1) are not statistically significant for the HAR(1, 7) and HAR(1, 7, 28) models, so that their respective GARCH(1, 1) counterparts are to be preferred. These empirical results show that the conditional volatility estimates are sensitive to the long memory nature of the conditional mean specifications. Although asymmetry is observed for the HAR(1) model, there is no evidence of leverage. The QMLE for the GARCH(1, 1), GJR(1, 1) and EGARCH(1, 1) models for international tourist arrivals to Taiwan are statistically adequate and have sensible interpretations. However, asymmetry (though not leverage) was found only for the HAR(1) model, and not for the HAR(1, 7) and HAR(1, 7, 28) models. ...|$|R
