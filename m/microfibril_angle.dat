Both theoretical and statistical examination of experimental data supports a square root transformation of lignin to predict <b>microfibril</b> <b>angle.</b> The experimental material used came from 10 longleaf pine (Pinuspalustris) trees. Klason lignin (n= 70), <b>microfibril</b> <b>angle</b> (n= 70), and extractives (n= 100) were measured and reported at different ring numbers and heights. All three traits were strongly influenced by ring age from pith while <b>microfibril</b> <b>angle</b> and extractives exhibited more of a height effect than lignin.

As a result, theoretical and experimental work provided evidence that lignin content {{played a significant role in}} how NIR absorbance relates to <b>microfibril</b> <b>angle.</b> Additionally, the large variation in extractives content coupled with sampling procedure proved important when developing NIR based calibration equations for lignin and <b>microfibril</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|E

The within-tree distributions were categorized into two types: (1) large values of longitudinal shrinkage near the pith that decreased with height and from pith to bark, (2) small values of longitudinal shrinkage near the pith that increased slightly from pith to bark. There were strong relationships between longitudinal shrinkage and <b>microfibril</b> <b>angle,</b> and modulus of elasticity, with large values of longitudinal shrinkage associated with large <b>microfibril</b> <b>angle</b> and low modulus of elasticity.

Average breast-height values for both trees and clones were calculated by weighting individual ring values by relative growth ring area. Significant variation was observed both among clones, and within and between trees for each clone. The clonal repeatability (an estimate of broad-sense heritability) of unweighted <b>microfibril</b> <b>angle</b> was 0. 7. The corresponding single ring values were high for rings 1 and 15 but were much lower for rings 5 and 10.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{extensibility}} {{of the wood}} cell-wall composite {{in the presence of}} parametric uncertainty by means of a multi-scale finite element approach. Normally, the three fundamental phases in wood, that is, cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose, present considerable scatter in their microstructure and mechanical properties. Nevertheless, by considering uncertainty in their properties, a significant computational cost is added to the solution of a large set of realisations represented by expensive fully-coupled multi-scale analyses. In order to tackle this high cost, we build a statistical approximation to the output of the computer model. Following this strategy, several micromechanical parameters are perturbed to study their influence on the extensibility of the material under tensile loading conditions. By reducing the cost of performing uncertainty analysis of the homogenised mechanical response, we are able to estimate the 5 -th, 50 -th, and 95 -th percentile of the ultimate tensile strains of the material.

30|$|We {{measured}} the longitudinal and tangential shrinking processes in wood specimens from Chamaecyparis obtuse Endl. with different <b>microfibril</b> <b>angles</b> (MFAs). The {{shape of the}} shrinking curve was compared with the MFA. Only the longitudinal shrinking process of specimens with a small MFA clearly showed nonlinearity, {{and the degree of}} nonlinearity increased as the MFA decreased. In contrast, the tangential shrinking process and the longitudinal shrinking process of compression wood with a large MFA were linear. The nonlinearity is probably caused by the longitudinal shrinkage of the noncrystalline region of the cellulose microfibril (CMF) in regions of low moisture content during water desorption. When the moisture content is high, the matrix substance in the cell wall begins to dry; however, the shrinkage in the chain direction is restrained by the rigid CMF. As the wood dries further, the noncrystalline region of the CMF embedded in the matrix substance begins to shrink. Because the longitudinal mechanical behavior of wood with a small MFA is greatly affected by a rigid CMF, longitudinal shrinkage increases suddenly at about 10 % moisture content; as a result, the shrinking process shows nonlinearity.|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanism}} of differentiation of tracheid (earlywood or latewood) should be elucidated {{to improve the}} wood properties of sugi trees (Cryptomeria japonica). Water deficit affects tracheid differentiation in conifers. However, the signals, which transmit the information of water contents in the soil to the differentiating tracheid, remain unknown. Plant responses with deficits of macronutrients or water showed some differences but also similarities, mostly involving hormonal long-distance signaling. In Arabidopsis, trans-zeatin (tZ)-type cytokinins play a role as a root-to-shoot acropetal signal. In this study, we report the effects of applying tZ alone or {{in combination with other}} phytohormones on tracheid differentiation in mature sugi trees forming latewood. The application of tZ induced the formation of earlywood-type tracheids with significantly smaller cell wall ratios and larger <b>microfibril</b> <b>angles</b> than those of controls in July, August and September. The application of indole acetic acid (IAA) in combination with tZ inhibited the effects of applied tZ, although gibberellic acid (GA 3) did not.

Microrobotics {{has provided a}} significant added value to multiple realms e. g. biomedical research, bio-based industry, microassembly of miniature products, etc. Recently, the use of microrobotic technology in paper industry has been also commenced for measuring properties at the single fibre level. There is a large interest in the measurement of different loading modes of individual fibre-fibre bonds in pulp and paper/board industry. Among the four different modes of loading, it would be desirable for papermaking companies and paper converting companies to obtain the Z-directional strength of pulp and paper. Indeed, the Z-directional properties affect compressive properties, and accordingly the performance of structural paperboard products. Several methods {{have been developed to}} measure the Z-directional strength at a handsheet level; however, there is not any reported device capable of the Z-directional fibre-fibre bond strength measurement at a fibre level. This thesis work presents a novel method for the experimental evaluation of the Z-directional bond strength using microrobotics and a Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film microforce sensor. Due to the special dynamics of PVDF microforce sensors, the effect of the deformation rate on the performance of the sensor is studied. The Z-directional fibre-fibre bond strength experiments have been performed successfully for unrefined and refined bleached softwood Kraft pulp fibres. Besides, paper scientists are interested in <b>microfibril</b> <b>angle</b> changes during and after application of the Z-directional force.

Large differences {{in all of the}} properties were observed with radial position, with properties generally being less desirable in the corewood. Significant undesirable differences between the improved families and the control were found for stiffness, strength and <b>microfibril</b> <b>angle.</b> There was no significant relationship between wood density and stiffness in samples taken from the inner part of the tree, where stiffness was more closely associated with <b>microfibril</b> <b>angle.</b> Overall, previous selections for growth rate and/or stem form have compromised timber properties. It is recommended that current breeding programmes focus on corewood stiffness to prevent further degradation in the wood properties of the future timber supply...|$|E

At this level, wood {{is composed of}} a periodic alternation of amorphous and crystalline cellulose fractions, embedded in a soft hemicellulose-lignin matrix. The mechanical response of wood is calculated under tensile loading conditions {{by means of the}} computational homogenisation of a representative volume element (RVE) of material. Three potential mechanisms of failure are suggested: axial straining of the crystalline fraction of cellulose, accumulation of plastic strain in the amorphous portion of cellulose and tensile rupture in the hemicellulose-lignin matrix due to cellulose fibres separation. In order to validate the present multi-scale framework, we compare our numerical predictions for the reorientation of cellulose fibres with experimental data, finding a good agreement {{for a wide range of}} strains. Furthermore, we assess successfully our numerical predictions for ultimate strains at the instant of failure when compared to experimental values. Numerical simulations show that our model is able to provide new clues into the understanding of how trees and plants optimise their microstructure in order to develop larger strains without apparent damage. A remarkable prediction by our model suggests that the extensibility of the material is maximised for initial <b>microfibril</b> <b>angles</b> (MFA) between 50 ° and 55 °, a range of values found typically in branches of trees, in which the extensibility is an essential requirement. These findings are likely to shed more light into the dissipative mechanisms of wood and natural materials, which are still not well-understood at present...|$|R
40|$|Challenging {{evaluation}} of tropical forest biodiversity requires {{the reporting of}} taxonomic diversity but also the systematic characterization of wood properties in order to discover new promising species for timber industry. Among wood properties, the dimensional stability {{is regarded as a}} major technological characteristic to validate whether a wood species is adapted to commercial uses. Cell structure and organization are known to influence the drying shrinkage making wood density and <b>microfibrils</b> <b>angle</b> markers of choice to predict wood dimensional stability. On the contrary the role of wood extractive content remains unclear. This work focuses on the fast-growing tropical species Bagassa guianensis and we report herein a correlation between heartwood drying shrinkage and extractive content. Chemical extractions and shrinkage experiments were performed on separate wood twin samples to better evaluate correctly how secondary metabolites influence the wood shrinkage behaviour. Extractive content were qualitatively and quantitatively analysed using HPLC and NMR spectroscopy. We found that B guianensis heartwood has a homogeneous low shrinkage along its radius that could not be explained only by its basic density. In fact the low drying shrinkage is correlated to the high extractive content and a corrected model to improve the prediction of wood dimensional stability is presented. Additionally NMR experiments conducted on sapwood and heartwood extracts demonstrate that secondary metabolites biosynthesis occurs in sapwood thus revealing B. guianensis as a Juglans-Type heartwood formation. This work demonstrates that B. guianensis, a fast-growing species associated with high durability and high dimensional stability, is a good candidate for lumber production and commercial purposes.

40|$|This study {{presents}} anatomical characteristics, mechanical properties, <b>microfibril</b> <b>angles</b> (MFAs) and Klason lignin {{contents of}} leaf-sheath fibrovascular bundles from 14 palm genera (18 species). Observed by light microscopy, all fibrovascular bundles consisted equally of thick-walled sclerenchyma fibers and vascular tissue, while {{the shape and}} localization of vascular tissues on the transverse sections varied among species. It was possible to group these fibrovascular bundles into 3 types based on the vascular tissue’s differences: type A – rounded in the central region; type B – angular in the marginal region; and type C – aliform in the central region. These three anatomical types of fibrovascular bundles showed some correlation with a current phylogenetic classification of palm species. Through mechanical tests, this research confirmed the correlation between diameter and mechanical properties of the fibrovascular bundles of palms; tensile strength and Young’s modulus showed a decreasing trend with increasing diameter. We clarified that this trend was due to a marked increase {{in the proportion of}} transverse sectional area comprised by vascular tissue with increasing diameter of fibrovascular bundles. The MFAs of fibrovascular bundles ranged from 10. 3 º to 47. 1 º, which were generally larger than those of non-woody plants, conifers, and broad-leaved trees. The Klason lignin contents of palm species were also high, ranging from 18. 3 % to 37. 8 %, with a mean value of 29. 6 %. These large MFAs and high lignin contents could lead to the long-term plastic deformation and relatively low tensile strength of palm fibrovascular bundles...|$|R
