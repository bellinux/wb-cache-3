40|$|Activated {{microglia}} secrete {{an array}} of pro-inflammatory factors, such as prostaglandins, whose accumulation contributes to neuronal damages. Prostaglandin endoperoxide synthases or cyclooxygenases (COX- 1 and COX- 2), which {{play a critical role}} in the inflammation, are the pharmacological targets of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, used to treat pain and inflammation. Since it was reported that COX- 1 is the major player in mediating the brain inflammatory response, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of highly selective COX- 1 inhibitors, such as P 6 and <b>mofezolac,</b> in neuroinflammation models. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -activated mouse BV- 2 microglial cells and LPS intracerebroventricular- injected mice as in vitro and in vivo neuroinflammation models, respectively, were used to probe the antiinflammatory efficacy of P 6 and <b>mofezolac.</b> Both P 6 and <b>mofezolac</b> reduce COX- 1 expression in LPS-activated BV- 2 cells. This reduction was accompanied with PGE 2 release reduction and NF-kB activation downregulation. Coextensively, in the in vivo model, both glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule- 1 expression, two markers of inflammation, were reduced by <b>mofezolac</b> to a rank depending on the encephalon area analyzed. The increase of COX- 1 expression observed in all the brain sections of LPS-treated mice was selectively downregulated by the in vivo treatment with <b>mofezolac</b> as well as PGE 2 release and Ikβα phosphorylation amount assayed in the brain areas tested. These results indicate the capability of P 6 and <b>mofezolac</b> to modulate the NF-kB signaling pathway, emphasizing the neuroprotective effect and therapeutic potential of COX- 1 inhibitors in the control of neuroinflammatory diseases...|$|E
40|$|The diarylisoxazole {{molecular}} scaffold {{is found}} in several NSAIDs, especially those with high selectivity for COX- 1. Here, we have determined the structural basis for COX- 1 binding to two diarylisoxazoles: <b>mofezolac,</b> which is polar and ionizable, and 3 -(5 -chlorofuran- 2 -yl) - 5 -methyl- 4 -phenylisoxazole (P 6) that has very low polarity. X-ray analysis of the crystal structures of COX- 1 bound to <b>mofezolac</b> and 3 -(5 -chlorofuran- 2 -yl) - 5 -methyl- 4 -phenylisoxazole allowed the identification of specific binding determinants within the enzyme active site, relevant to generate structure/activity relationships for diarylisoxazole NSAIDs...|$|E
40|$|Neuroinflammation is the {{earliest}} stage of several neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. In {{the case of}} neurodegenerative disorders, it takes place about 15 â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 320 years before the appearance of specific neurodegenerative clinical symptoms. Constitutive microglial COX- 1 {{is one of the}} pro-inflammatory players of the neuroinflammation. Novel compounds 3, 14 and 15 (Galmof 0, Galmof 5 and Galmof 11, respectively) were projected, and their synthetic methodologies developed, by linking by an ester bond, directly or through a C 5 or C 11 unit linker the highly selective COX- 1 inhibitor <b>mofezolac</b> (COXs selectivity index > 6000) to galactose in order to obtain substances capable to cross blood-brain barrier (BBB) and control the CNS inflammatory response. 3, 14 and 15 (Galmofs) were prepared in good to fair yields. Galmof 0 (3) was found to be a selective COX- 1 inhibitor (COX- 1 IC 50 = 0. 27 Î¼M and COX- 2 IC 50 = 3. 1 Î¼M, selectivity index = 11. 5), chemically and metabolically stable, and capable to cross Caco- 2 cell monolayer, resembling BBB, probing that its transport is GLUT- 1 -mediated. Furthermore, Galmof 0 (3) powerfully inhibits PGE 2 release higher than <b>mofezolac</b> (1) in LPS-stimulated mouse BV 2 microglial cell line, a worldwide recognized neuroinflammation model. In addition, Fingerprints for Ligands and Proteins (FLAP) was used to explain the different binding interactions of Galmofs with the COX- 1 active site...|$|E
40|$|Few {{selective}} cyclooxygenase- 1 (COX- 1) inhibitors {{have been}} described up to now, although recent studies underlined the involvement of COX- 1 in the carcinogenesis, pathogenesis of neuroinflammation, cardiovascular diseases and pain. Among the known COX- 1 inhibitors none {{proved to be a}} good drug candidate, with the exception of <b>mofezolac,</b> that is clinically used as an analgesic drug. New selective inhibitors were very often discovered as a minor achievement during SAR investigations to discover selective COX- 2 inhibitors (COXIBs). After a recognition of the new COX- 1 inhibitors synthesized in the last five years, it was attempted to draw, for each chemical class, a structure which might highlight the determinant molecular features able to switch the selectivity towards the COX- 1 isoform. Overall, this review could constitute a tool to a better design of novel selective COX- 1 inhibitors, to be used in a disease theranostic approach targeting COX- 1...|$|E
40|$|Since {{cyclooxygenase}} (COX) isozymes discovery, {{many papers}} and reviews {{have been published}} to describe the structural bases of COX inhibition, and to debate on the therapeutic and adverse effects of worldwide clinically used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), included COX- 2 selective inhibitors (well known as Coxibs). COX- 2 inhibition has been widely investigated, whereas the role of COX- 1 in human pathophysiology is mostly not yet well ascertained. As time goes on, the cliché that the constitutively expressed isoform COX- 1 is only involved in normal physiological functions, such as platelet aggregation, gastric mucosa protection and renal electrolyte homeostasis {{is going to be}} shattered. Low-dose aspirin, behaving as a preferential inhibitor of platelet COX- 1, allowed to enlighten the role exerted by this isoenzyme in many mammalian cell types. This review would elucidate the most recent findings on selective COX- 1 inhibition and their relevance to human pathology such as cancer, neuro-inflammation, cardioprotection, fever and pain. It would also focus on the design and development of new highly selective COX- 1 inhibitors, useful tools in pharmacological studies aimed at gaining a deeper insight of the role of COX- 1 in human health and disease. Among the traditional NSAIDs, other then aspirin and indomethacin, only few examples of selective COX- 1 inhibitors (SC- 560, FR 122047, <b>mofezolac,</b> P 6 and TFAP) have been so far identified. This review has also the scope to stimulate the development of novel drugs, which activity is COX- 1 mediated...|$|E
40|$|NSAIDs {{are used}} to relieve pain and {{decrease}} inflammation by inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) -catalyzed prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. PGs are fatty acid mediators involved in cartilage homeostasis, however the action of their synthesizing COX-enzymes in cartilage differentiation is not well understood. In this study we hypothesized that COX- 1 and COX- 2 have differential roles in chondrogenic differentiation. ATDC 5 cells were differentiated {{in the presence of}} COX- 1 (SC- 560, <b>Mofezolac)</b> or COX- 2 (NS 398, Celecoxib) specific inhibitors. Specificity of the NSAIDs and inhibition of specific prostaglandin levels were determined by EIA. Prostaglandins were added during the differentiation process. Chondrogenic outcome was determined by gene- and protein expression analyses. Inhibition of COX- 1 prevented Col 2 a 1 and Col 10 a 1 expression. Inhibition of COX- 2 resulted in decreased Col 10 a 1 expression, while Col 2 a 1 remained unaffected. To explain this difference expression patterns of both COX-enzymes as well as specific prostaglandin concentrations were determined. Both COX-enzymes are upregulated during late chondrogenic differentiation, whereas only COX- 2 is briefly expressed also early in differentiation. PGD 2 and PGE 2 followed the COX- 2 expression pattern, whereas PGF 2 α and TXA 2 levels remained low. Furthermore, COX inhibition resulted in decreased levels of all tested PGs, except for PGD 2 and PGF 2 α in the COX- 1 inhibited condition. Addition of PGE 2 and PGF 2 α resulted in increased expression of chondrogenic markers, whereas TXA 2 increased expression of hypertrophic markers. Our findings point towards a differential role for COX-enzymes and PG-production in chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC 5 cells. Ongoing research is focusing on further elucidating the functional partition of cyclooxygenases and specific prostaglandin production...|$|E
