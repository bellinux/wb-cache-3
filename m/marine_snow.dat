5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of life on Earth lives in mesophyllic (moderate) environments, a few organisms, most of them microbes, have managed to colonise extreme environments that are unsuitable for most higher life forms. There are bacteria, for example, living in Lake Whillans, half a mile below the ice of Antarctica; in the absence of sunlight, they must rely on organic material from elsewhere, perhaps decaying matter from glacier melt water or minerals from the underlying rock. Other bacteria can be found in abundance in the Mariana Trench, the deepest place in the ocean and on Earth; <b>marine</b> <b>snow</b> drifts down from the surface layers of the sea and accumulates in this undersea valley, providing nourishment for an extensive community of bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Oceanographers {{divide the}} ocean into {{different}} vertical zones defined by physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone includes all open ocean regions, {{and can be}} divided into further regions categorized by depth and light abundance. The photic zone includes the oceans from the surface to a depth of 200m; it is the region where photosynthesis can occur and is, therefore, the most biodiverse. Because plants require photosynthesis, life found deeper than the photic zone must either rely on material sinking from above (see <b>marine</b> <b>snow)</b> or find another energy source. Hydrothermal vents are the primary source of energy in {{what is known as the}} aphotic zone (depths exceeding 200m). The pelagic part of the photic zone is known as the epipelagic.|$|E

2500|$|Finding a mate in the {{three-dimensional}} space of open water is challenging. Some copepod females {{solve the problem}} by emitting pheromones, which leave a trail in the water that the male can follow. Copepods experience a low Reynolds number and therefore a high relative viscosity. One foraging strategy involves chemical detection of sinking <b>marine</b> <b>snow</b> aggregates and taking advantage of nearby low-pressure gradients to swim quickly towards food sources.|$|E
2500|$|The {{availability}} of plankton for food diminishes rapidly with depth. At 1000 metres, {{the biomass of}} plankton is typically about 1 percent of that at the surface, and at 5000 metres about 0.01 percent. Given there is no sunlight, energy enters deep water zones as organic matter. There are three main ways this happens. Firstly, organic matter can move into the zone from the continental landmass, for example, through currents that carry the matter down rivers, then plume along the continental shelf and finally spill down the continental slope. Other matter enters as particulate matter raining down from the overhead water column {{in the form of}} <b>marine</b> <b>snow,</b> or as sinking overhead plant material such as eelgrass, or as [...] "large particles" [...] such as dead fish and whales sinking to the bottom. A third way energy can arrive is through fish, such as vertically migrating mesopelagic fishes that can enter into the demersal zone as they ascend or descend. The demersal fish and invertebrates consume organic matter that does arrive, break it down and recycle it. A consequence of these energy delivery mechanisms is that the abundance of demersal fish and invertebrates gradually decrease as the distance from continental shorelines increases.|$|E

40|$|Remote Sensing (RS) {{refers to}} the science of {{identification}} of earth surface features and estimation of their geo-biophysical properties using electromagnetic radiation as a medium of interaction. Spectral, spatial, temporal and polarization signatures are major characteristics of the sensor/target, which facilitate target discrimination. Earth surface data as seen by the sensors in different wavelengths (reflected, scattered and/or emitted), is radio-metrically and geo-metrically corrected before extraction of spectral information. RS data, with its ability for a synoptic view repetitive coverage with calibrated sensors to detect changes, observations at different resolutions, provides a better alternative for natural resources management as compared to traditional methods. The traditional classification methods have been developed using the image statistics, but their applicability to the processing of data is limited due {{to the presence of}} mixed pixels which affect the use of remotely sensed data in Land-Use and Land-Cover (LU/LC) classification and change detection. Various techniques are being used to attempt to ‘unmix’ the information and identify mixing proportions from the pixels and have lead to sub-pixel classification. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to understand mixed pixel problems, its significance and techniques developed to ‘unmix’ the pixels, and also to study the various soft classification methods. It is understood that mixed pixel classification could be solved efficiently by Soft Classification methods, and Contextual Classification adopting relaxation labeling would give better results both in Neural Network based and Fuzzy Logic based Classification.

50|$|Nutrients {{that do not}} {{get used}} up on the surface will {{eventually}} sink down and nourish the seafloor habitat. The deep benthic habitats of the ocean gyres have been thought to typically consist {{of some of the}} most food-poor regions on the planet. One of the sources of nutrients to this deep ocean habitat is <b>marine</b> <b>snow.</b> <b>Marine</b> <b>snow</b> consists of detritus, dead organic matter, which falls from the surface waters where productivity is highest and exports carbon and nitrogen from the surface mixed layer to the deep ocean. Data on the abundance of <b>marine</b> <b>snow</b> to the deep ocean floor is lacking in this large ecosystem. However, Pilskaln et al. found that in the NPSG, <b>marine</b> <b>snow</b> was at a higher abundance than expected and were surprisingly comparable to a deep coastal upwelling system.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>snow</b> often forms during algal blooms. As {{phytoplankton}} accumulate, they aggregate or get {{captured in}} other aggregates, {{both of which}} accelerate the sinking rate. Aggregation and sinking is actually {{thought to be a}} large component of sources for algae loss from surface water. Most organic components of <b>marine</b> <b>snow</b> are consumed by microbes, zooplankton and other filter-feeding animals within the first 1,000 metres of their journey. In this way <b>marine</b> <b>snow</b> may be considered the foundation of deep-sea mesopelagic and benthic ecosystems: As sunlight cannot reach them, deep-sea organisms rely heavily on <b>marine</b> <b>snow</b> as an energy source.

5000|$|Because of the {{relatively}} long residence time of the ocean's thermohaline circulation, carbon transported as <b>marine</b> <b>snow</b> into the deep ocean by the biological pump can remain out of contact with the atmosphere for more than 1000 years. That is, when the <b>marine</b> <b>snow</b> is finally decomposed to inorganic nutrients and dissolved carbon dioxide, these are effectively isolated from the surface ocean for relatively long time-scales related to ocean circulation. Consequently, enhancing the quantity of <b>marine</b> <b>snow</b> that reaches the deep ocean {{is the basis of}} several geoengineering schemes to enhance carbon sequestration by the ocean. Ocean nourishment and iron fertilisation seek to boost the production of organic material in the surface ocean, with a concomitant rise in <b>marine</b> <b>snow</b> reaching the deep ocean. [...] These efforts have not yet produced a sustainable fertilization that effectively transports carbon out of the system.|$|E
40|$|The Byers Group, exposed on Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island and Snow Island, Antarctica, is a mudstone-dominated {{sequence}} {{deposited in}} a fore-arc setting. Palynological studies on {{parts of the}} Byers Group have provided new data on Early Cretaceous biostratigraphy, palaeoenvironments and palaeoclimate. Dinoflagellate cyst assemblages date the President Beaches Formation as latest Early Berriasian-Berriasian, and a latest Berriasian-earliest Valanginian to Middle Valanginian age is suggested for the Chester Cone Formation. The boundary between the President Beaches and Chester Cone formations is dated as latest Berriasian. Dinoflagellate cyst assemblages permit correlation of the <b>marine</b> mudstones from <b>Snow</b> Island (President Head) within the Byers Group stratigraphy of Byers Peninsula.

40|$|Measurement of lead isotope ratios in {{environmental}} matrices using inductively coupled plasma-dynamic reaction cell-mass spectrometry at low sample consumption rates was investigated. Two micro-sample introduction systems were evaluated, namely the PFA micronebuliser {{associated with a}} low-volume spray chamber, working at 150 mL min? 1 and the total-consumption sample introduction system TISIS, operating at 20 mL min? 1. In both cases, the dynamic reaction cell pressurised with ammonia was applied to improve the precision by collisional damping. Under optimal operating conditions, 208 Pb/ 207 Pb and 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios were accurately determined with an internal precision of 0. 12 – 0. 13 % and 0. 17 – 0. 18 % (%RSD, n ¼ 10, c ¼ 10 mgL? 1; t ¼ 10 s).

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{environmental}} studies, isotope ratio measurements can help to discriminate between natural and anthropogenic inputs, {{as well as to}} identify their source regions and transport pathways. However, environmental samples can be characterised by a low amount of the target elements, thus hindering the measurement of precise and accurate isotope ratios. During this doctoral study, research activity was carried out taking into account both analytical and environmental aspects related to the determination of isotope ratios in environmental matrices. On the analytical side, much effort was focused on obtaining precise and accurate isotope ratios at low amount of the target element, using single-collector and multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In particular, performances obtained measuring 208 Pb/ 207 Pb and 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios by single-collector ICP-MS at low sample consumption rates were investigated evaluating two micro-sample introduction systems: the PFA micro-nebuliser, working at 150 μL/min, and the torch integrated sample introduction system (TISIS), working at 20 μL/min. Under optimal conditions and using ammonia as damping gas, repeatability was 0. 12 ± 0. 03 and 0. 17 ± 0. 04 % RSD at 10 ng/mL of Pb, whereas the sample consumption was < 1. 5 and 0. 2 mL. TISIS was also coupled with multi-collector ICP-MS achieving a repeatability of 0. 016 % consuming only 0. 2 mL of sample solution. The coupling of the instrumental method with a pre-concentration step provided accurate ratios at Pb concentration levels down to 5 pg/g. Finally, the use of multi-collector ICP-MS with a membrane nebuliser desolvating system was also investigated for the measurement of precise and accurate 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios, obtaining an intermediate precision of 0. 019 % at 0. 4 ng/mL Sr concentration. The developed methods were largely applied to various environmental studies in the framework of PNRA (Italian National Program for Antarctic Research) and RIS (Research in Svalbard) projects. Indeed, Pb isotope ratios were precisely and accurately measured in atmospheric particulate, surface <b>snow,</b> <b>marine</b> suspended particulate matter and sediment samples, collected from both the Arctic and Antarctica. Data were discussed in a multidisciplinary context and provided very useful information on sources and transport pathways of trace elements. In particular, results for atmospheric particulate matter collected at Ny-Ålesund (Svalbard islands), showed a recurring seasonal transition with higher load of atmospheric Pb related to mining activities in Russia during spring, and inputs of anthropogenic Pb coming from eastern North America during summer. Similar measurements were also applied to suspend particulate matter collected from the marine environment of the Kongsfjorden (close to Ny-Ålesund) and distinguished between anthropogenic Pb associated to intruding Atlantic water, and crustal Pb associated to glacial run-off. In {{the context of}} the Antarctic research, the chemical and isotopic characterisation of size-segregated atmospheric particulate collected at Terra Nova Bay (Northern Victoria Land) revealed that both the crustal and anthropogenic elements were related to the air masses carried by the katabatic wind from the inland, whereas the marine input appeared to be higher in January when the sea-ice extent was reduced. Furthermore, the Pb isotope ratios pointed out that the anthropogenic input was likely related to the polluted aerosols from South America and Australia, representing the predominant fraction (50 – 70 %) of the Pb measured in the samples. Finally, the precise measurement of Pb isotope ratios in surface snow from the Antarctic plateau enabled the identification of seasonal and inter-annual variations in the main sources of atmospheric Pb reaching Antarctica...|$|R
