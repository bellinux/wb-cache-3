5|$|At Nhu's request, Tung was {{reported}} to have been planning an operation under the cover of a government-organised student demonstration outside the US Embassy, Saigon. In this plan, Tung's <b>men</b> <b>would</b> assassinate ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. and other key officials among the confusion. Another target was the Buddhist leader Thích Trí Quang, who had been given asylum in the embassy after being targeted in the pagoda raids. According to the plan, Tung's <b>men</b> <b>would</b> then burn down the embassy.|$|E

5|$|The 30,000 Austrians {{and their}} 100 guns were opposed by 22,000 French and their 15 guns. Meanwhile, after {{the arrival of}} Desaix, 6,000 <b>men</b> <b>would</b> {{reinforce}} Bonaparte's army.|$|E

5|$|The {{responsibility}} for supplying the army rested with the praefectus praetorio of the operational sector. He in turn controlled {{a hierarchy of}} civilian authorities (diocesan vicarii and provincial governors), whose agents collected, stored and delivered supplies to the troops directly or to predetermined fortified points. The quantities involved were enormous and would require lengthy and elaborate planning for major campaigns. A late legion of 1,000 <b>men</b> <b>would</b> require a minimum of 2.3 tonnes of grain-equivalent every day. An imperial escort army of 25,000 <b>men</b> <b>would</b> thus require around 5,000 tonnes of grain-equivalent for three months' campaigning (plus fodder for the horses and pack animals).|$|E
5|$|After the war started, the FBB {{provided}} wider security {{protection for}} Hitler when {{in residence at}} the Berghof, as he travelled by vehicle to front-line command posts and at military headquarters. They would be in heavily armed vehicles at {{the front and back}} of Hitler's convoy. In addition, army motorcycle outriders were positioned at the front and rear of the convoy of vehicles. The FBK would ride with Hitler and the RSD <b>men</b> <b>would</b> ride in a separate car during the trips.|$|E
5|$|After {{traveling}} through Delphi, the warrior obtained the venomous blood of a cerberus. Eventually, both Circe and the warrior encountered the general, who was {{revealed to be}} the warrior's uncle. The general revealed that he killed the warrior's father because he refused to join the general. Circe was then revealed to be the general's lover who had only aided the warrior so he would reach the general, who planned to offer the warrior a chance to serve him in his warmongering conquests. The warrior refused, and Circe offered him with a choice; to serve the general and his <b>men</b> <b>would</b> be spared from Circe's wrath, or to kill the general and his men shall die. The Giver, who followed the two, reminded the warrior {{that if he were}} to kill the general, {{who was a member of}} his family, the oath he made to his father would be broken, yet if he killed Circe, his <b>men</b> <b>would</b> perish and the oath he made to protect his <b>men</b> <b>would</b> be broken. The warrior declared that he would not slay Circe and defended the lives of his men. He tricked the general into drinking from a cup he had secretly filled with the cerberus's blood, which killed the general. Circe was aghast at the warrior's vengeful act and retreated. Because the warrior killed his own uncle, the oath he made to his father was broken. The Giver revealed himself to be Orkos, the oath keeper of the Furies and the warrior was imprisoned by the Furies in the Prison of the Damned.|$|E
6000|$|She {{instantly}} understood him. And {{more than}} that, she secretly admired {{him for the}} scrupulous delicacy with which he had expressed himself. Another <b>man</b> <b>would</b> not have thought of sparing her in that way. Another <b>man</b> <b>would</b> have said, plainly, [...] "Horace is jealous of me." ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>man</b> <b>would</b> {{have been}} {{standing}} on the south tower, which had an observation deck; yet the north tower, without such a deck, was the first tower to be hit. It is unlikely that a <b>man</b> <b>would</b> be posing for an image after the north tower was hit.|$|R
60|$|The <b>man</b> <b>would</b> rather {{think she}} was, but wouldn't quite know. Then he would {{ring a bell}} that rang upstairs, and would look up the staircase, and would say, yes, she was at home, and was coming down. Then Miss Nipper would appear, and the <b>man</b> <b>would</b> retire.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of their {{increasing}} isolation from the majority of anti-war anarchists, George Woodcock notes that Kropotkin and anarchists who supported his position drew closer together in the months that preceded the Manifestos creation. Several of these same <b>men</b> <b>would</b> later sign the Manifesto, including Jean Grave, Charles Malato, Paul Reclus, and Christiaan Cornelissen.|$|E
5|$|Black women {{played a}} minor role in units {{such as the}} Rhodesia Native Regiment, {{accompanying}} the black soldiers into the operational area and performing domestic tasks like washing and cooking. Many of these were local East African women who had formed attachments with RNR soldiers. Officers tolerated {{the presence of these}} women in the interest of morale, aware that attempting to take them away from the <b>men</b> <b>would</b> probably lead to mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Hearing of Olid's rebellion, {{and of his}} {{clash with}} González, Cortés sent his cousin Francisco de las Casas to bring the rival captains into line. Cortés was {{confident}} {{that the majority of}} Olid's <b>men</b> <b>would</b> rally to las Casas, and only assigned him about 150 men for the expedition. Las Casas arrived off Triunfo de la Cruz as Olid was making preparations to attack Gil González Dávila, who was in the Naco valley.|$|E

5|$|Hines {{thought it}} would be easier to enter the North from Canada and {{traveled}} there during the winter. Hines led the Northwest Conspiracy from Canada in the fall of 1864. Colonel Benjamin Anderson was involved in the plot, along with other Confederate soldiers. It was hoped that Hines and his <b>men</b> <b>would</b> be able to free the Confederate prisoners held at Camp Douglas in Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, Australia's federal {{government}} confirmed that a detention centre for single <b>men</b> <b>would</b> be {{built at the}} old army barracks at Pontville, 45 minutes north of Hobart, Tasmania. This immigration detention centre would house up to 400 refugees. Also in April 2011, immigration detainees at the Villawood detention centre rioted in protest of their treatment, setting fire to several buildings.|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{during the}} 1950s, many {{families}} would intentionally hang gandingans outside their houses so other neighbors could easily hear them play. Young <b>men</b> <b>would</b> gather around the gandingan and gossip about people they dislike, usually “chatting” with other gandingan players further away. Locals says {{much of this}} jovial talk even contained sexual innuendoes, where all kinds of dirty words could be heard penetrating the night air.|$|E

5|$|Other {{businessmen}} reaped great rewards in retail, shipping, entertainment, lodging, or transportation. Boardinghouses, food preparation, sewing, {{and laundry}} were highly profitable businesses often run by women (married, single, or widowed) who realized <b>men</b> <b>would</b> pay {{well for a}} service done by a woman. Brothels also brought in large profits, especially when combined with saloons and gaming houses.|$|E
5|$|The {{fine for}} {{neglecting}} fyrd, {{the obligation to}} do military service for the king, is set at 120 shillings for a nobleman, and 30 shillings for a ceorl, incidentally revealing that ceorls were required {{to serve in the}} army. Scholars have disagreed on the military value of the ceorl, but {{it is not surprising that}} all free <b>men</b> <b>would</b> fight, since defeat might have meant slavery.|$|E
5|$|The match {{ended when}} Lex Luger and Bret Hart {{simultaneously}} eliminated each other. Two referees argued about who had landed first while several inconclusive camera angles were broadcast. Eventually, WWF President Jack Tunney {{came to the}} ring and had Finkel announce that both <b>men</b> <b>would</b> be considered winners. The situation regarding the title shot at WrestleMania X, {{which was to be}} given to the winner, remained unresolved until the following week on Monday Night Raw.|$|E

50|$|Denver {{would lead}} the entire game, as their number 1 ranked defense outlasted Tom Brady and New Englands number 1 ranked offense 20-18. Towards the end, the Patriots would score with 18 seconds left, and tried to tie the game, but Bradys 2-point pass was intercepted and was no good. The Patriots would try an onside kick, but it wouldnt hold up, and the Broncos won, {{advancing}} to Super Bowl 50. This {{would be the last}} time that Tom Brady and Peyton <b>Manning</b> <b>would</b> play each other, as <b>Manning</b> <b>would</b> retire the following season. <b>Manning</b> <b>would</b> ultimately end his career 3-1 against Brady in the AFC Championship game.|$|R
5|$|The three {{infantry}} classes {{may have}} retained some slight parallel to social divisions within Roman society, {{but at least}} officially the three lines were based upon age and experience rather than social class. Young, unproven <b>men</b> <b>would</b> serve in the first line, older men with some military experience would serve in the second line, and veteran troops of advanced age and experience would serve in the third line.|$|E
5|$|Woodfull {{told the}} Nottinghamshire administrators that, if Voce's leg side bowling was repeated, his <b>men</b> <b>would</b> leave {{the field and}} return to London.

Already angered by the absence of Larwood, the Nottinghamshire faithful heckled the Australians all day. Australia had previously and privately complained that some pacemen had strayed past the agreement in the Tests.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{rendezvous}} with Robert E. Lee's retreating forces at Farmville, Virginia, Breckinridge moved south to Greensboro, North Carolina, where he, Naval Secretary Stephen Mallory, and Postmaster General John Henninger Reagan joined Generals Joseph E. Johnston and P. G. T. Beauregard to urge surrender. Davis and Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin initially resisted, but eventually asked Major General William T. Sherman to parley. Johnston and Breckinridge negotiated terms with Sherman, but President Andrew Johnson (who had assumed the presidency on Lincoln's assassination on April 15) rejected them as too generous. On Davis' orders, Breckinridge told Johnston to meet Richard Taylor in Alabama, but Johnston, believing his <b>men</b> <b>would</b> refuse to fight any longer, surrendered to Sherman on similar terms to those offered to Lee at Appomattox.|$|E
