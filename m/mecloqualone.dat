50|$|Mebroqualone (MBQ) is a quinazolinone-class GABAergic {{and is an}} {{analogue}} of <b>mecloqualone</b> {{that has}} similar sedative and hypnotic properties to its parent compound, resulting from its agonist activity at the β subtype of the GABAa receptor. It was originally synthesized in the 1960s Mebroqualone differs from <b>mecloqualone</b> by having a bromine atom instead of a chlorine on the 3-phenyl ring. It was made illegal in Germany in 1998 but little other information is available. It would appear that this compound was sold {{on the black market}} in Germany as a designer drug analogue of <b>mecloqualone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Examples of quinazolinones include cloroqualone, diproqualone, {{etaqualone}} (Aolan, Athinazone, Ethinazone), mebroqualone, <b>mecloqualone</b> (Nubarene, Casfen), and methaqualone (Quaalude).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mecloqualone</b> (Nubarene, Casfen) is a quinazolinone-class GABAergic {{and is an}} {{analogue}} of methaqualone {{that was}} first made in 1960 and marketed mainly in France and some other European countries. It has sedative, hypnotic, and anxiolytic properties caused by its agonist activity at the β subtype of the GABAa receptor, and {{was used for the}} treatment of insomnia. [...] <b>Mecloqualone</b> is faster-acting but shorter-lasting than methaqualone and so was used only as a sleeping pill, in contrast to methaqualone, which was used as a general-purpose anxiolytic as well. <b>Mecloqualone</b> was never as widely used as methaqualone and is no longer prescribed because of concerns about its potential for abuse and overdose. In the United States it is a Schedule I non-narcotic (depressant) controlled substance with an ACSCN of 2572 and zero annual aggregate manufacturing quota.|$|E
50|$|North, Central, and South American clandestine {{drug markets}} {{typically}} source the drug from industrial-scale illegal drug labs in Mexico, Colombia, Belize, Peru and elsewhere. Smaller labs occasionally are uncovered in the United States and Canada {{and the final}} percentage of methaqualone as well as <b>mecloqualone,</b> other chemical relatives, other congeners, and unreacted precursors form a chemical profile {{which can be used}} as a fingerprint to identify the likely origin of batches of the drug just as such things as morphine content and its relation to heroin content and presence of codeine, acetylcodeine, noscapine, papaverine, and other opium components form a chemical fingerprint for batches of heroin.|$|E
50|$|The {{drug was}} more tightly {{regulated}} in Britain under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 {{and in the}} U.S. from 1973. It was withdrawn from many developed markets in the early 1980s. In the United States it was withdrawn in 1982 and made a Schedule I drug in 1984. It has a DEA ACSCN of 2565 and in 2013 the aggregate annual manufacturing quota for the US was 10 grams. Mention of its possible use in some types of cancer and AIDS has periodically appeared in the literature since the late 1980s; research {{does not appear to}} have reached an advanced stage. The DEA has also added the methaqualone analogue <b>mecloqualone</b> (also a result of some incomplete clandestine syntheses) to Schedule Ias ACSCN 2572, and zero manufacturing quota.|$|E
