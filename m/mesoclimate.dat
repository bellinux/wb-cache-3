25|$|As {{part of the}} Burgundy wine region, {{the hill}} of Corton shares the same {{continental}} climate {{as the rest of}} the Côte-d'Or. The particularly <b>mesoclimate</b> of Corton-Charlemagne is fractionally cooler, by a few growing degrees than the lower slopes that produce red Corton AOC. The majority of Corton-Charlemagne grapes come from the westerly exposed lieu-dits of Le Charlemagne and En Charlemagne. Being not as favorably exposed as the eastern facing lieu-dits of Corton, both the Chardonnay and few Pinot noir plantings on these slopes tend to ripen later than the Corton sectors, producing wines that tend to have slightly less body and richness to them.|$|E

In addition to finding vineyards along the Loire, several of the river's tributaries are also well planted—including the Allier, Cher, Indre, Loir, Sèvre Nantaise and Vienne Rivers. The climate can be very cool with spring time frost being a potential hazard for the vines. During the harvest months rain can cause the grapes to be harvested under ripe but can also aid in the development of Botrytis cinerea for the region's dessert wines.|$|E

25|$|Several <b>mesoclimates</b> {{exist within}} the area due to various weather and {{geographical}} influences. The open {{southern end of}} the valley floor is cooler during the growing season due to the proximity of San Pablo Bay while the sheltered, closed northern end is often much warmer.

50|$|The {{island of}} Corsica {{is the most}} mountainous island in the Mediterranean. The climate is warmer and drier than in {{mainland}} France. During the peak growing month of July, the mean average temperature is 74 °F (23.3 °C. The average annual rainfall for most Corsica's wine growing regions is 29 inches (730 mm) and 2.6 inches (65 mm) during the harvest month of September. Very little rain falls during months of August and September allowing for a dry, rot-free harvest for most vintages. Corsica averages around 2,750 hours of sunshine a year, with the nearby sea absorbing most of the heat {{during the day and}} radiating it back to the island at night. This creates a more consistent temperature and sharply reduces the diurnal temperature variation. Throughout the mountainous terrain there are several <b>mesoclimates</b> created by the differing degrees of altitude, latitude and maritime influences.|$|R
25|$|For most of history, {{regional}} tradition largely dictated {{what type}} of vine training would {{be found in a}} given area. In the early 20th century, many of these traditions were codified into specific wine laws and regulations such as the French Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) system. The widespread study and utilization of various training systems began in the 1960s when many New World wine regions were developing their wine industry. Without the centuries of tradition that influenced Old world winemaking and viticulture, vine growers in areas like California, Washington, Australia and New Zealand conducted large scale research into how particular vine training systems, pruning and canopy management techniques impacted wine quality. As research in this area continued into the 21st century, new vine training systems were developed that could be adapted to the desired wine making style the grapes were destined for as well as the labor needs and particular <b>mesoclimate</b> of the vineyard.|$|E
2500|$|The {{soils and}} {{climate of the}} regions {{are very similar to}} Mendoza but the unique <b>mesoclimate</b> and high {{elevation}} of the vineyards typically produces grapes with higher levels of total acidity which contribute to the wines balance and depth.

2500|$|Located {{among the}} Langhe hills, the Barolo zone is a {{collection}} of different <b>mesoclimate,</b> soil types, altitudes and expositions that can have a pronounced effect {{on the development of the}} Nebbiolo grape and the resulting Barolo wine. Within the Barolo zone there are two major soil types separated by the Alba-Barolo road. Within the communes of Serralunga d'Alba and Monforte d'Alba is a compact, sandstone based soil dating from the Helvetian epoch. In the Barolo and La Morra zone, the soils are similar to those found in the Barbaresco zone, dating from the Tortonian period, being [...] composed of calcareous marl that is more compact and fertile. Throughout the Barolo zone there are clay deposits and soil with enough alkalinity to tame Nebbiolo's naturally high acidity.

2500|$|In {{general the}} Barossa Valley has a {{continental}} climate but its series of transverse valleys and sloping hills does produce {{a wide range}} of <b>mesoclimates.</b> Temperatures vary from very warm on the valley floors to progressively cooler at higher altitudes on the hillsides and further North in the valley. Despite its reputation as a [...] "warm climate region", many of the Barossa Valley's climate figures are not that dissimilar from the relatively cooler Margaret River in Western Australia-though the Barossa Valley does have a wider diurnal temperature range. During the [...] heat summation and mean temperatures during the October to April growing season, the region receives about 1710 heating degree days with mean average temperatures during the crucial ripening month of January being around 70°F (21.4°C). Rainfall during the growing season averages only around 6.3 inches (160mm), with average relative humidity around 39%, which means that viticultural irrigation is often used. The exception is many of the old vine vineyards on the slightly cooler western side of the valley which is often dry-farmed without irrigation.|$|R
40|$|The Neogene was {{a period}} of {{long-term}} global cooling and increasing climatic variability. Variations in African-Asian monsoon intensity over the last 7 Ma have been deduced from patterns of eolian dust export into the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea as well as from lake level records in the East African Rift System (EARS). However, lake systems not only depend on rainfall patterns, but also on the size and physiography of river catchment areas. This study is based on stable isotope proxy data (¹⁸O/¹⁶O, ¹³C/¹²C) from tooth enamel of hippopotamids (Mammalia) and aims in unravelling long-term climate and watershed dynamics that control the evolution of palaeolake systems in the western branch of the EARS (Lake Albert, Uganda) during the Late Neogene (7. 5 Ma to recent). Having no dietary preferences with respect to wooded (C₃) versus grassland (C₄) vegetation, these territorial, water-dependant mammals are particularly useful for palaeoclimate analyses. As inhabitants of lakes and rivers, hippopotamid tooth enamel isotope data document <b>mesoclimates</b> of topographic depressions, such as the rift valleys and, therefore, changes in relative valley depth instead of exclusively global climate changes. Consequently, we ascribe a synchronous maximum in ¹⁸O/¹⁶O and ¹³C/¹²C composition of hippopotamid enamel centred around 1. 5 - 2. 5 Ma to maximum aridity and/or maximum hydrological isolation of the rift floor from rift-external river catchment areas in response to the combined effects of rift shoulder uplift and subsidence of the rift valley floor. Structural rearrangements by ~ 2. 5 Ma within the northern segment of the Albertine Rift are well constrained by reversals in river flow, cannibalisation of catchments, biogeographic turnover and uplift of the Rwenzori horst. However, a growing rain shadow is not obvious in 18 O/ 16 O signatures of the hippopotamid teeth of the Albertine Rift. According to our interpretation, this {{is the result of the}} overriding effect of evaporation on 18 O/ 16 O responding to aridification of the basin floor by a valley air circulation system through relative deepening of the valley. On the other hand, a synchronous arid pulse is not so clearly recorded in palaeosol data and mammalian fauna of the eastern branch of the EARS. This discrepancy indicates that rift <b>mesoclimates</b> may represent an underestimated aspect in previous palaeoclimate reconstructions from rift valley data and represent a clear limitation to attempts at global climate reconstructions. The results of this study also suggest that using 18 O/ 16 O data as a proxy to rain shadow evolution must take into account relative basin subsidence to properly document mountain range uplift. 13 page(s...|$|R

Mediterranean ecosystems are recognized biodiversity hotspots, {{but are also}} global climate change hotspots due to the concerted action of multiple environmental drivers. The Italian Peninsula presents {{a wide range of}} all these site-related elements influencing grapevine performance. From a climatic perspective, it delivers a relatively large set of <b>mesoclimates,</b> spanning from dryer regions, in the inner south, to more humid regions, in the northwest and northeast. Topography and soils are also quite distinct throughout the peninsula, ranging from extended flatland areas to steep mountainous regions, each with very different soil characteristics, which may influence crop selection and settlements in each region. All these elements are reflected in the different varieties grown throughout the peninsula. This study aims to provide an improved assessment of the practical adaptation options for the viticulture of Tuscany and of Valpolicella and what could be the strength and resilience to climate change of grapevine varieties in these areas. According to the models tested, Italian viticulture is able to adapt better than other countries to global warming, as the placing at various altitudes up in the high hills and mountains sets off the mechanism called resilience...|$|R

Among the Mendocino wine regions in this warmer area are the Redwood Valley, Potter Valley, Cole Ranch, McDowell Valley, Covelo, Dos Rios AVAs as well as most of the large general area Mendocino AVA. In this eastern region, the ranges serve as a type of rain shadow and barrier to the cool Pacific fog which leaves the climate during the growing season much drier and warmer with ratings of Region III and IV on the Winkler scale.|$|R
