It seems to me that on one page I recognized a portion of an old diary of mine which mysteriously disappeared shortly after <b>my</b> <b>marriage,</b> and, also, scraps of letters which, though considerably edited, sound to me vaguely familiar. In fact, Mr. Fitzgerald—I believe that is how he spells his name—seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home.|$|E

500|$|The {{marriage}} of her favourite hurt the Queen deeply. She never accepted it, humiliating Leicester in public: [...] "my open and great disgraces delivered from her Majesty's mouth". Then again, {{she would be}} as fond of him as ever. In 1583 she informed ambassadors that Lettice Dudley was [...] "a she-wolf" [...] and her husband a [...] "traitor" [...] and [...] "a cuckold". Lady Leicester's social life was much curtailed. Even her movements could pose a political problem, as Francis Walsingham explained: [...] "I see not her Majesty disposed to use the services of my Lord of Leicester. There is great offence taken at the conveying down of his lady." [...] The Earl stood by his wife, asking his colleagues to intercede for her; there was no hope: [...] "She [...] doth take every occasion by <b>my</b> <b>marriage</b> to withdraw any good from me", Leicester wrote even {{after seven years of}} marriage.|$|E

500|$|When Lehzen was {{dismissed}} {{from the court}} in 1842 {{she returned to her}} native Germany, living in Bückeburg near Hanover. She lived with her sister on the generous pension that Victoria sent her, and covered the walls of her house with portraits of the queen. Though her sister died several months later, the baroness continued to support financially her many nieces and nephews. Lehzen continued to regard Victoria with affection, and the queen wrote regularly to her former governess, weekly at first and later monthly at Lehzen's request. When visiting relations in Germany, the queen came to visit her twice in private. The Baroness Lehzen died in Bückeburg on 9 September 1870, where she is buried in Jetenburger cemetery. Queen Victoria ordered the erection of a memorial to her. After Lehzen's death, Queen Victoria spoke of her gratitude for their relationship, but commented [...] "after I came to the throne she got to be rather trying, and especially so after <b>my</b> <b>marriage...</b> from any evil intention, only from a mistaken idea of duty and affection for me." ...|$|E
