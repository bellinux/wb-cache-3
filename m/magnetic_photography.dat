40|$|Abstract—High-speed <b>photography</b> and <b>magnetic</b> field probes {{were used}} to {{visualize}} and study the formation and propagation of current sheets in a pulsed plasma accelerator. Magnetic field mea-surements complement photographic records, as the latter indi-cate {{the location of the}} plasma but not necessarily current, whereas magnetic field data provide an unambiguous picture of the current location, but do not directly yield the location of the plasma. The observed current sheet evolution was found to be rich in features and has produced fundamental insight into the phenomena of cur-rent sheet canting and trailing wake formation. Index Terms—Current density, <b>magnetic</b> field measurement, <b>photography,</b> plasma engines, plasma sheaths, visualization.

40|$|The US DOE is endeavoring {{to clean}} up {{contamination}} created by the disposal of chemical and nuclear waste on the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR), Tennessee, {{with an emphasis on}} minimizing off-site migration of contaminated surface and ground water. The task is complicated by inadequate disposal records and by the complexity of the local geology. Remote sensing data, including aerial photography and geophysics, have {{played an important role in}} the ORR site characterization. Are there advantages to collecting remote sensing data using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV`s) ? In this paper, I will discuss the applications of UAV`s being explored at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) under the sponsorship of the Department of Energy`s Office of Science and technology. These applications are : aerial <b>photography,</b> <b>magnetic</b> mapping, and Very Low Frequency (VLF) electromagnetic mapping...|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} {{speed and}} canting angle of current sheets in a pulsed electromagnetic accelerator were measured using three different techniques: high-speed <b>photography,</b> <b>magnetic</b> field probes, and laser interferometry. Current sheet canting may have ad-verse effects on accelerator performance. The {{goal of the}} present work {{is to provide a}} database of cant-ing angles under a variety of experimental condi-tions. Eight different propellants (hydrogen, deu-terium, helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and methane) were tested in a rectangular-geometry ac-celerator, at pressures ranging from 50 - 400 mTorr. The photographic, magnetic, and interferometric di-agnostics were used to infer the spatial configura-tion of the current sheet by measuring the its opti-cal emission, current density, and electron density, respectively. The three techniques gave qualitative agreement; the magnetic and interferometric mea-surements gave general quantitative agreement as well. The canting angle was found to depend o...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} and confinement of laser-created plumes expanding across a transverse magnetic field have been investigated. 1. 06 mm, 8 ns pulses from a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser {{were used to}} create an aluminum plasma which was allowed to expand across a 0. 64 T <b>magnetic</b> field. Fast <b>photography,</b> emission spectroscopy, and time of flight spectroscopy were used as diagnostic tools. Changes in plume structure and dynamics, enhanced emission and ionization, and velocity enhancement were observed {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field. Photographic studies showed that the plume is not fully stopped and diffuses across the field. The temperature of the plume was found to increase due to Joule heating and adiabatic compression. The time of flight studies showed that all of the species are slowed down significantly. A multiple peak temporal distribution was observed for neutral species...|$|R
40|$|The {{first phase}} of the Trypillia mega-sites’ methodological {{revolution}} began in 1971 with aerial <b>photography,</b> <b>magnetic</b> prospection, and archaeological excavations of huge settlements of hundreds of hectares belonging to the Trypillia culture in Ukraine. Since 2009, we have created a second phase of the methodological revolution in studies of Trypillia mega-sites, which has provided more significant advances in our understanding of these large sites than any other single research development in the last three decades, thanks partly to the participation of joint Ukrainian-foreign teams. In this paper, we outline the main aspects of the second phase, using examples from the Anglo-Ukrainian project ‘Early urbanism in prehistoric Europe: the case of the Trypillia mega-sites’, working at Nebelivka (also spelled ‘Nebilivka’), and the Ukrainian-German project ‘Economy, demography and social space of Trypillia mega-sites’, working at Taljanky (‘Talianki’), Maydanetske (‘Maydanetskoe’), and Dobrovody, as well as the smaller site at Apolianka...|$|R
30|$|Hemispheric {{photographs}} {{were taken to}} quantify light conditions using a 4.5 mm F 2.8 Ex Sigma circular fish eye lens (Sigma Corporation, Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan) and Canon Eos 500 D digital camera (Canon Inc., Ōta, Tokyo, Japan) mounted on a tripod. The lens was positioned approximately 1 m above ground level, pointed directly upward, with {{the top of the}} camera oriented to <b>magnetic</b> north. <b>Photography</b> was performed only on uniformly overcast days to ensure no overexposure of photos that would give false measures of canopy coverage during analysis. Three {{photographs were}} taken within each quadrat at 5 m, 10 m, and 15 m as measured from the corner of the quadrat along the 20 m side and 1 m {{from the edge of the}} 2 m side. Gap Light Analyser (GLA) V 2 (Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Millbrook, New York, USA) was used to analyze the canopy photographs. This program determined direct and diffuse light at the point at which the image was taken (i.e., 1 m above ground). Data for total extra-terrestrial radiation and the monthly cloudiness index for the region (Australian Bureau of Meteorology 2014) were used to calculate the spectral fraction (the percentage of all solar radiation falling at ground level that is photosynthetically active) and the beam fraction (the percentage of direct and diffuse light as modified by clouds) as described in Frazer et al. (1999). These data, along with the mean elevation and the approximate center co-ordinate of all sites, were entered into the GLA program to calculate the incoming PAR at each site. The GLA software allows a user-defined setting of the color threshold when converting to black and white. For this reason, all images were converted into black and white within the program using the same threshold setting of 220, chosen subjectively to best match the unmodified photographs, and used for all photographs for consistency between analyses.|$|R
40|$|A {{key issue}} in coastal hazards {{research}} {{is the need to}} distinguish sediments deposited by past extreme storms from those of past tsunamis. This study contributes to this aim by investigating patterns of sedimentation associated with extreme coastal flood events, in particular, within the Lagoa de Óbidos (Portugal). The recent stratigraphy of this coastal lagoon was studied using a wide range of techniques including visual description, grain-size analysis, digital and x-ray <b>photography,</b> <b>magnetic</b> susceptibility and geochemical analysis. The sequence was dated by 14 C, 210 Pb and Optically Stimulated Luminescence. Results disclose a distinctive coarser sedimentary unit, within the top of the sequence studied, and shown in quartz sand by the enrichment of elements with marine affinity (e. g., Ca and Na) and carbonates. The unit fines upwards and inland, thins inland and presents a sharp erosive basal contact. A noticeable post-event change in the sedimentary pattern was observed. The likely agent of sedimentation is discussed here and the conceivable association with the Great Lisbon tsunami of AD 1755 is debated, while a comparison is attempted with a possibly synchronous deposit from a tsunami in Martinhal (Algarve, Portugal). The possibility of a storm origin is also discussed {{in the context of the}} storminess of the western Portuguese coast and the North Atlantic Oscillation. This study highlights certain characteristics of the sedimentology of the deposits that may have a value in the recognition of extreme marine inundation signatures elsewhere in the world...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for the award of Master of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel UniversityAbrupt marine invasions such as tsunamis and storms are particularly devastating for coastal areas. They may also leave a permanent {{record in the}} sedimentary deposits which is the principal focus of this thesis. In historical times the most destructive tsunami that affected Europe was the AD 1755 Lisbon. The effects and consequences of the AD 1755 tsunami are presented. The causes, propagation and behaviour of tsunamis are also discussed. Sedimentological criteria to identify abrupt marine invasions in the stratigraphic column are presented from literature. This thesis aims {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of the signature left by abrupt marine invasions in coastal stratigraphy by investigating the nature of the sedimentary record associated with tsunamis in a region of their known impact. A wide range of proxies was used to detected tsunami and storm deposits in 2 coastal areas of Portugal. The techniques used include stratigraphic description, grain size analysis, digital and x-ray <b>photography,</b> <b>magnetic</b> susceptibility, macrofossils analysis, geochemical analysis and 210 Pb and Optically Stimulated Luminescence dating. The investigated areas (e. g. Lagoa de Óbidos (Central Portugal) and Martinhal (South Portugal)) were affected by the AD 1755 tsunami. The locations have similar geomorphological features and are both susceptible to major abrupt marine invasions. Results show that an abrupt event deposited unique sedimentary units in both locations. A similar age for the event was established. A considerable number of tsunami sedimentary characteristics were detected in both units. However, a key outcome of this research is the demonstration of the difficulty of distinguishing between sedimentary deposits laid down by tsunamis, and those deposits resulting from storm action; consequently the geological record of tsunamis almost certainly underestimates their frequency...|$|R
