5|$|Cosimo did {{not enjoy}} a {{harmonious}} relationship with his elder son, Ferdinando. They disagreed about Cosimo's bigoted ideology and his <b>monthly</b> <b>allowance.</b> Cosimo married him to a Bavarian princess, Violante Beatrice. This union was exceedingly discontent, and produced no offspring. Anna Maria Luisa was the Grand Duke's favourite child. She married Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine, and like her brother, had no issue. Gian Gastone, Cosimo's eventual successor, despised {{his father and his}} court. Anna Maria Luisa arranged for him to marry Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, a union that produced no children.|$|E
5|$|Shaftesbury and {{his third}} wife had {{separated}} in April 2004 and divorce proceedings had been set in motion. By that time, {{he had given her}} a windmill in the Gers region of southwestern France, the €700,000 duplex in a villa in Cannes, which included staff, a 4x4 car, and a <b>monthly</b> <b>allowance,</b> ranging between €7,500 and €10,000. Shaftesbury wanted to end this arrangement and the marriage, so that he could marry his new girlfriend. While Shaftesbury was discussing his desire with his wife, a fight broke out between him and his wife's brother, Mohammed M'Barek. Lord Shaftesbury died during the fight, when Mohammed strangled him, breaking his neck.|$|E
5|$|On August 19, 1864, {{with his}} {{remaining}} guerrillas facing serious supply problems and suffering from hunger, Định was betrayed {{by a former}} follower and ambushed by French forces. Wounded and facing imminent capture, Định committed suicide. His 20-year-old son Truong Quyen (1840–1870), attempted with modest success to carry on his father's struggle. A new base {{was set up in}} Tây Ninh. It allowed more room for tactical manoeuvring but still depended on supplies being carried north from Tan Hoa. Quyen was eventually killed and in 1874, long after the southern insurgency had been crushed, Tự Đức granted a <b>monthly</b> <b>allowance</b> in grain and cash to Định's widow Le Thi Thuong, who had returned to her native village in Quảng Ngãi, which at the time was still in independent Vietnamese territory. The ration of 20 francs and 60 litres of rice was substantial, because the monthly salary of a ninth-rank mandarin was only 18 francs and 48 litres of rice.|$|E
50|$|Nothing {{is known}} about Funky's past except {{that he and his}} sidekick Houseroy (popularly {{considered}} to be a caricature of Roy Thomas) were business associates of a Colonel Mockingbird. After Mockingbird's death, Funky and Houseroy lived on <b>monthly</b> <b>allowances</b> (most likely their inheritance from Mockingbird) that were automatically doled out.

5|$|Suffering from {{recurrent}} fever and a tremor (possibly malaria) since his voyage, Cabral withdrew to Santarém in 1509. He spent his remaining years there. Only sketchy {{information is available}} as to his activities during that time. According to a royal letter dated 17 December 1509, Cabral was {{party to a dispute}} over a transaction involving property which belonged to him. Another letter of that same year reported that he was to receive certain privileges for an undisclosed military service. In 1518, or perhaps previously, he was raised from fidalgo to knight in the King's Council and was entitled to a <b>monthly</b> <b>allowance</b> of 2,437 reais. This was in addition to the annual allowance granted to him in 1497, and still being paid. Cabral died of unspecified causes, most probably in 1520. He was buried in the São João Evangelista chapel of the Convento da Graça in Santarém.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Ali {{delegated}} {{the administrative}} affairs of Muar to the Raja Temenggung of Muar (also {{known by the}} title of Temenggong Paduka Tuan of Muar) {{and spent most of}} his time in Malacca. Muar was sparsely populated in 1855 and had a population of 800 and no formal structure of government was formed. In 1860, Sultan Ali reportedly borrowed $53,600 from a Chettiar money lender, Kavana Chana Shellapah. Sultan Ali signed an agreement with Shellapah to contribute a portion of his <b>monthly</b> <b>allowance</b> to repay his debt. However, Sultan Ali found himself unable to settle his debts in time, and an angry Shellapah wrote to the British government in 1866. Pressured to liquidate his debts in time, Sultan Ali granted Shellapah the right to trade off Muar to the Temenggong of Johor as mortgage if he is unable to pay off his debts in time.|$|E

Some individual resentment may also be compounded by the typically low wages paid to conscripts—the current Israeli policies see National Service as a duty rendered to the country and its citizens, and therefore the Israeli army does not pay any wages to conscripts, but instead grants a low <b>monthly</b> <b>allowance</b> to the full-time national service personnel, depending on the type of their duty.|$|E
