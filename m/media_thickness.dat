We evaluated two carotid ultrasound measurements, namely intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness</b> and total plaque volume, in a Canadian Oji-Cree population with a high {{metabolic syndrome}} prevalence rate. Methods As part of the Sandy Lake Complications Prevalence and Risk Factor Study, 166 Oji-Cree subjects (baseline metabolic syndrome prevalence, 44. 0 %, according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines) were examined using a high-resolution duplex ultrasound scanner. Results Image analysis showed that mean intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness</b> was elevated in subjects with the metabolic syndrome (818 ± 18 vs 746 ± 20 μm), as was total plaque volume (125 ± 26 vs 77. 3 ± 17. 0 mm 3).

40|$|ISBN: 2868839010 International audienceWith {{the advent}} of the present and future spatial X-ray missions, it becomes crucial to model {{correctly}} the line spectrum of X-ray emitting/absorbing media. We have built a photoionization code, TITAN, solving the transfer of a thousand lines and of the continuum with the ?Accelerated Lambda Iteration? method (ALI), which is most reliable for line transfer. We give some details about this method and a justification for its use as a complement to usual approximations (e. g., escape probability or two-stream) made at present in other codes. We show that the escape probability approximation leads to a wrong estimation of the emitted X-ray line intensities, especially in the soft X-ray range. The errors can exceed one order of magnitude in the case of thick <b>media</b> (Thomson <b>thickness</b> of the order of unity). It also happens, but for different reasons, in the case of moderately thin <b>media</b> (Thomson <b>thickness</b> of 0. 001 to 0. 1), characteristic of the Warm Absorber in Seyfert 1 or of the X-ray emitting medium in Seyfert 2.

The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the changes in the {{clinical}} characteristics and carotid atherosclerosis of patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) over the last 9 years. MethodsA cross-sectional study of 150 consecutive patients with ESKD who had initiated maintenance dialysis between January 2005 and December 2013 was conducted. The patients' mean age was 68  ±  13 years. The group comprised 73 % men, and 63 % of the patients had diabetic nephropathy. The carotid artery-intima <b>media</b> <b>thicknesses</b> and the plaque scores (PS) were measured using carotid artery ultrasonography within 3 months of dialysis initiation. Changes in the patients' carotid atherosclerosis and clinical characteristics over the years were examined by categorizing the patients into 3 groups representing 3 -year intervals based on when dialysis was initiated. ResultsThe PS declined from 12. 8 to 5. 4 (P =  0. 001). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels declined over the 9 -year period (P =  0. 005 and P =  0. 006, respectively), and the ratio of statin users increased markedly from 24 % to 54 % (P =  0. 001). Univariate regression analysis identified a positive correlation between the PS and LDL-C (r =  0. 281; P =  0. 01), and a strong positive correlation was found between the PS and LDL-C after adjusting for various risk factors for atherosclerosis.

40|$|Abstract- Background: Inflammation has {{a strong}} {{association}} with increased atherosclerosis in RA. Indirect evidence of accelerated atherosclerosis in RA comes from studies measuring carotid artery intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness</b> (CIMT). Aims of the study: To study the correlation, if any, between inflammation (severity and duration) to intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness</b> (As a marker of atherosclerosis). Methodology: Carotid intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness</b> (CIMT) was measured in 30 patients of RA divided into three groups of thirty each based on duration of disease (less than two years, two to five years, and more than five years). Both common carotid intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness</b> (CCIMT) and total carotid intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness</b> (TCIMT, i. e., mean of values of CCA, ICA, and ECA). The values were compared to DAS- 28 activity score. Thirty healthy subjects (age and sex matched) were taken as controls. Results: The RA subjects had a CCIMT and TCIMT 0. 798 ± 0. 19 mm and 0. 756 ± 0. 17 mm respectively when compared to controls, i. e., 0. 591 ± 0. 11 mm and 0. 57 ± 0. 11 mm (p value < 0. 001). Both CCIMT and TCIMT increased significantly with duration of disease but did not differ when compared to disease activity.

According to the 10 -year risk of coronary heart disease the patients were categorized in the three groups: 10 -year risk 20 % (III). The aortic flow propagation velocity (Vp) was measured from descending aorta with color M-mode echoardiography. The slope of the first aliasing contour was accepted as Vp. It was compared with Framingham coronary risk score, carotid intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness</b> and high sensitive C-reactive protein. Twelve patients {{were excluded from the}} study due to poor acoustic window. Results The Vp was significantly lower (p< 0. 001), carotid intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness</b> and high sensitive C-reactive protein was signifi- cantly higher in group III (p= 0. 002 and p= 0. 014).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Elevated {{levels of}} calcium and {{parathyroid}} hormone (PTH), characteristics of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), {{may be associated}} with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the general population. We evaluated the possible vascular effects of these risk factors in patients with mild PHPT by using standard methods and new imaging techniques. DESIGN: A prospective case-control study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with mild PHPT without any known cardiovascular risk factors were studied at baseline and at one year after parathyroidectomy (PTX) in comparison with 48 healthy age- and gender-matched controls. We measured biochemical variables, augmentation index (AIx), aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV(ao)), radial (IMT(rad)) and common carotid artery (IMT(cca)) intima <b>media</b> <b>thicknesses,</b> and the grayscale median (IM-GSM) of the latter. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between PHPT patients and controls at baseline for AIx (28. 6 ± 12. 2 vs. 27. 7 ± 12. 8 %), IMT(rad) (0. 271 ± 0. 060 vs. 0. 255 ± 0. 053 mm), IMT(cca) (0. 688 ± 0. 113 vs. 0. 680 ± 0. 135 mm), or IM-GSM (82. 3 ± 17. 2 vs. 86. 5 ± 15. 3), while PWV(ao) was slightly higher in patients (8. 68 ± 1. 50 vs. 8. 13 ± 1. 55, p< 0. 05). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), calcium, and PTH were higher in patients compared with controls, and decreased after PTX, while vitamin D was lower in patients and increased after PTX. While AIx, PWV(ao), IMT(rad), and IMT(cca) were related to SBP, neither correlated to vitamin D levels. Only PWV(ao) correlated weakly to plasma PTH (r =  0. 29, p< 0. 01) and ionized calcium (r =  0. 22, p< 0. 05) but showed no relation when age and SBP were adjusted for. CONCLUSION: We found normal arterial function despite high calcium, PTH, and low vitamin D levels, in patients with mild PHPT without cardiovascular risk factors. The cardiovascular risk associated with low vitamin D and/or high PTH and calcium levels may be explained by their coupling to blood pressure and other risk factors rather than direct effects on arterial structure...|$|R

Methods: Carotid artery intima- <b>media</b> <b>thickness</b> (measured by B-mode ultrsonography), coronary artery calcium score (determined by high resolution computed tomography), serum adiponectin, Fasting blood sugar, serum lipids, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were measured in 123 asymptomatic newly diagnosed cases of type 2 diabetes mellituss and 152 age and sex matched healthy control subjects. Results: Serum adiponectin and lipids were significantly lower in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (P< 0. 01). Left, right and mean carotid artery intima- <b>media</b> <b>thickness,</b> coronary artery calcium score, fasting blood sugar, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were significantly higher among diabetic patients compared to healthy controls (P< 0. 05). Mean carotid artery intima- <b>media</b> <b>thickness</b> was positively and independently related to age (P< 0. 001) and triglyceride (P= 0. 01) in diabetic group.

Participants were 81 African American and 78 Caucasian adolescents (mean ageÂ =Â  17. 8) from two schools in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Measures of subclinical CVD were pulse wave velocity and intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness,</b> as assessed by Doppler and B-mode ultrasound, respectively. SES indices included parental education, family income, family assets, subjective social status, and census-derived neighborhood SES. Hypotheses were evaluated in multiple linear regression models with the covariates age, gender, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure. Results indicated that African American adolescents were more often in low SES positions than Caucasians. When considered individually, racial and SES disparities in pulse wave velocity, and to a lesser extent, intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness,</b> were evident. When race and SES were considered together, high school education, low or medium income, and low neighborhood SES were associated with higher pulse wave velocity. Fewer assets were associated with higher intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness.</b> In conclusion, racial and SES disparities in indices of subclinical CVD were observed, with findings most pronounced for SES disparities in pulse wave velocity. This study extends previous findings in adults to adolescents, indicating that disparities in arterial stiffness and intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness</b> occur as early as adolescence. Efforts to reduce socioeconomic and racial disparities in CVD should target disparities early in life.

40|$|In {{the era of}} XMM-Newton and Chandra missions, it {{is crucial}} to use codes able to compute {{correctly}} the line spectrum of X-ray irradiated thick <b>media</b> (Thomson <b>thickness</b> of the order of unity) to build models for the structure and the emission of the central regions of AGN or X-ray binaries. In all photoionized codes except in our code Titan, the line intensities are computed with the "escape probability approximation". In its last version, Titan solves the transfer of a thousand lines and of the continuum with the ``Accelerated Lambda Iteration" method, {{which is one of the}} most efficient and most secure for line transfer. We find that for conditions typical of the AGN or X-ray binary emission medium, all escape approximations commonly used lead to an overestimation of the soft X-ray lines which can reach one order of magnitude for intense lines.

40|$|Imaging {{through thick}} highly {{scattering}} <b>media</b> (sample <b>thickness</b> ≫ mean free path) can realize broad applications in biomedical and industrial imaging {{as well as}} remote sensing. Here we propose a computational “All Photons Imaging” (API) framework that utilizes time-resolved measurement for imaging through thick volumetric scattering by using both early arrived (non-scattered) and diffused photons. As opposed to other methods which aim to lock on specific photons (coherent, ballistic, acoustically modulated, etc.), this framework aims to use all of the optical signal. Compared to conventional early photon measurements for imaging through a 15 [*]mm tissue phantom, our method shows a two fold improvement in spatial resolution (4 db increase in Peak SNR). This all optical, calibration-free framework enables widefield imaging through thick turbid media, and opens new avenues in non-invasive testing, analysis, and diagnosis.

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of Marit Herder's {{doctoral}} thesis, available in Munin at [URL] Data {{on the effect of}} lipid-lowering drugs (LLD) on carotid atherosclerosis outside clinical trials are limited. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of LLD on change in carotid intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness</b> and total plaque area in a general population. Subjects were 1532 women and 1442 men who participated in a longitudinal population-based study with ultrasound examination of intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness</b> and total plaque area in the right carotid artery at baseline and after 13 years follow-up. Long-term use of LLD was defined as use for > 5 years, any-time use of LLD was defined as use at baseline or at 6 years or at 13 years of follow-up. In multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, prevalent cardiovascular disease, and daily smoking, long-term use of LLD had a protective effect on progression of both intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness</b> (β=– 0. 0387 mm; P= 0. 002) and total plaque area (β=– 0. 400 mm 2; P= 0. 006). There was a weaker protective effect of any-time use of LLD on progression of intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness</b> (β=– 0. 024 mm; P= 0. 046) and total plaque area (β=– 0. 318 mm 2; P= 0. 06).

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of thyroid-stimulating (TSH) and free thyroxin (fT 4) hormones on carotid intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness</b> (cIMT). Material and methods: Sixty nine consecutive patients who attended to the Department of University Clinic of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic disorders with newly diagnosed subclinical hypothyroidism (ScH) were evaluated for mean and maximal cIMT. ScH were defined as elevated TSH with normal fT 4 serum values. Results: Mean TSH, fT 4, cIMT, and max cIMT were: 7, 9 ± 3, 6 mU/L, 14, 5 ± 2, 8 pmol/L, 0, 61 ± 0, 1 mm, and 0, 65 ± 0, 1 mm, respectively. Statistically significant positive correlation were evaluated between TSH value and mean and max cIMT (r= 0, 28, and r= 0, 29, respectively p< 0, 05). While fT 4 statistically significant negative correlated with mean and max cIMT (r=- 0, 35, and r=- 0, 33, respectively p< 0, 01). Conclusion: Thyroid hormone values are correlated with carotid intima <b>media</b> <b>thickness</b> in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.

40|$|We induced {{arterial}} balloon injuries twice via a hyperdiastolic {{balloon catheter}} {{inserted into the}} carotid artery ofWister rats in order to observe {{the changes in the}} intima and the <b>media.</b> The <b>thickness</b> of the intima reached a maximum by 14 days after the injury. In a comparison of the thickness of the intima with samples having a once-induced arterial balloon injury, the samples with twice-induced arterial balloon injuries were found to have thickened more significantly. When the proliferating cells of the intima were observed, many proliferative smooth muscle cells were found. In themodels of the twice-induced arterial balloon injuries, the area of the media decreased, while the area of the intima increased. In the models of the twice-induced arterial balloon injuries, intimal hyperplasia with positive remodeling 1 was observed, and findings were obtained that were substantially similar to lesions due to either intimal hyperplasia of arteriosclerosis lesions or intimal hyperplasia of restenotic lesions after PTA or stent placement...|$|R

40|$|Shield volcanoes, caldera-bearing stratovolcanoes, and monogenetic cones {{compose the}} large fissural Payen Volcanic Complex, {{located in the}} Andes {{foreland}} between latitude 35 °S and 38 °S. The late Pliocene-Pleistocene and recent volcanic activity along E-W trending eruptive fissures produced basaltic lavas showing a within-plate geochemical signature. The spatial distribution of fractures and monogenetic vents is characterized by self-similar clustering with well defined power law distributions. Vents have average spacing of 1. 27 km and fractal exponent D = 1. 33 defined in the range 0. 7 – 49. 3 km. The fractal exponent of fractures is 1. 62 in the range 1. 5 – 48. 1 km. The upper cutoffs of fractures and vent fractal distributions (about 48 – 49 km) scale to the crustal thickness in the area, as derived from geophysical data.
