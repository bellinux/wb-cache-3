5000|$|White Mountain was {{originally}} formulated as a <b>malternative,</b> {{was the top}} selling brand of <b>malternative</b> beverages which were very popular in the mid-to-late 1980s. White Mountain was often called a wine cooler but was more accurately labeled a [...] "beer cooler" [...] by many as its base was an alcoholic malt beverage rather than wine. The beverage was very sweet and came in strong fruit flavors such as Wild Raspberry, Original Citrus, and Cranberry Splash that obscured the taste of its alcoholic base. It was considered a popular alternative to beer, and was often targeted toward women and younger audiences.|$|E
5000|$|An alcopop (or cooler, spirit {{cooler in}} South African English, or <b>malternative</b> in American slang) {{is a term}} {{describing}} certain flavored alcoholic beverages with relatively low alcohol content (e.g., 3-7% alcohol by volume), including: ...|$|E
50|$|A renaissance in the <b>malternative</b> {{industry}} {{that began with}} Zima and continued through the late 1990s introducing brands such as Mike's Hard Lemonade and Smirnoff Ice {{has been marked by}} better advertising and crisper tasting products than the White Mountain Cooler. However, for many members of Generation X, White Mountain marked the genesis of beer-based beverages for people who did not like to drink beer.|$|E
50|$|Competitors to White Mountain {{included}} Gallo's Bartles and Jaymes wine coolers, Seagrams Coolers, Brown Forman's California Cooler, Canandaigua Wine Company's Sun Country Wine Cooler, Miller Brewing Company's Matilda Bay Coolers and Anheuser-Busch's Dewey Stevens coolers and malt based beverages like G.Hielmans Champale and Malt Duck. Wine Cooler sales {{started to}} fall sharply {{by the end of}} the decade, and White Mountain along with the entire industry virtually disappeared in the early 1990s. The emergence of Zima as the new <b>malternative</b> marked the end of White Mountain. Miller and Anheuser Busch exited the wine cooler market. California Cooler and Sun Country ceased production. Gallo and Seagrams switched their Coolers to Malt based in the late 1980s.|$|E
40|$|Ranking and {{evaluation}} of properreservoir water level outflowing into downstream river system under multi-criterion environment was presented using multi-criteria decision approach specifically Fuzzy Composite Programming (FCP). The optimum water level evaluation is vital {{to take into consideration}} the various environmental, water quantity and economical aspects of the overall systems. This multicriteria analysis will optimize water release, ensuring water quality, providing economical benefits and maintaining high quality of the natural landscape. The study mainly focuses on optimizing outflowing water level by identifying and grouping the basic indicators into its particular composite structure. The basic indicators include various water quality parameters, flowrates, rainfall, scenery etc. The composite structure of the overall reservoir water use system was presented. Five(5) alternatives based on reservoir water level was adopted which include 20. 6 m (Alternative 1), 22. 2 <b>m(Alternative</b> 2), 23. 8 <b>m(Alternative</b> 3), 25. 4 m (Alternative 4) and 27. 0 <b>m(Alternative</b> 5) respectively. Sensitivity analysis using three (3) set of different weights was performed for analyzing the robustness of the optimum water level obtained. The FCP structure consists of 15 first level indicators, 5 second level indicators, 2 third level indicators and the final indicators. The optimum value was determined based on the shortest distance between the fuzzy box and an ideal point. The optimum answer was also obtained from the highest ordered sequence value. The highest ranking order indicated by highest ordered sequence value obtained was Alternative 3 (0. 660), followed by Alternative 4 (0. 596), Alternative 2 (0. 555), Alternative 5 (0. 515) and lastly Alternative 1 (0. 500). The highest ranking order indicated the most optimum, advisable and appropriate water level for Layang reservoir...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} study we measure {{the extent to which}} youth {{perceive}} they are targeted by alcohol ads; examine variables that predict the perception of oneself as a target of alcohol ads; and test if the perception of oneself as a target predicts exposure and attention to alcohol ads. We also determine if the perception of oneself as target varies within individuals and research the effects of within-individual variance. ^ In a longitudinal panel design 4 waves of data were collected using computer-aided telephone interviews. Youth aged 14 - 19 were sampled purposively from a purchased list of randomly selected U. S. households. Interviews were conducted June 2002 through August 2004. Sample sizes per wave were: 2083, 1594, 1140, 840. Respondents rated {{the extent to which they}} felt targeted by beer, liquor and premixed (a. k. a. <b>malternative)</b> drink ads. Self-report data on exposure to alcohol ads, attention to alcohol ads, alcohol expectancies, and identification with alcohol ads were also collected. ^ Controlling for prior drinking, age, and gender the perception of oneself as a target of alcohol ads increased exposure and attention to alcohol advertising. Therefore, for both teens who drank an average amount and teens who did not drink at all, thinking of themselves as targets of alcohol advertising increased the amount of ads these teens saw and the amount of attention they paid to alcohol ads. Within-individual analysis showed that the when people feel more targeted by alcohol ads than they normally feel they see more alcohol ads. ^ Ninety-three percent youth surveyed at baseline felt targeted to some degree by alcohol advertising, with half feeling more than somewhat targeted by alcohol ads. There is a linear increase in feeling targeted by alcohol ads from ages 14 to 17 with ages 17 through 19 feeling targeted at the same level. Teens felt more targeted by beer ads than they did for premixed drink and liquor ads. ^ Though alcohol advertisers have publicly stated that youth are not intentionally targeted by alcohol ads this study shows that youth feel targeted by alcohol ads and feeling targeted increases both exposure to alcohol ads and attention to alcohol ads. ...|$|E
