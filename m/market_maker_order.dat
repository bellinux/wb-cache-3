40|$|We {{explore the}} role of dealers to {{determine}} whether they are liquidity-providing market makers or liquidity-taking information traders. Standard models of market making, such as Kyle (1985) and Grossman and Miller (1988), imply a negative contemporaneous correlation between <b>market</b> <b>maker</b> <b>order</b> flow and stock returns. We test this relation with a unique dataset containing trades of all dealers in a well-developed, liquid market. The correlation is strongly positive, implying that dealers take liquidity. We also develop a unique profit decomposition to compare intraweek information and market making profits. Dealers earn significant excess returns, in aggregate driven by information rather than market making. Subgroup analysis reveals that information profits are positive and increasing in stock capitalization, and market making returns are positive and significant for all bu...|$|E

To that end we provide a characterization of the equilibrium outcomes of the game between the firms and the <b>market</b> <b>maker.</b> Our results highlight that the equilibrium structure is impacted dramatically by the <b>market</b> <b>maker's</b> objective - depending on the objective there may be a unique equilibrium, multiple equilibria, or no equilibria. Further, the game may be a potential game (as in the case of classical Cournot competition) or not. Beyond characterizing the equilibria of the game, we provide an approach for designing the <b>market</b> <b>maker</b> in <b>order</b> to optimize a design objective (e. g., social welfare) at the equilibrium of the game.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how a <b>market</b> <b>maker</b> actively influences <b>order</b> flow and induces information from traders {{in a market}} that includes both traders with private information about the security and uninformed liquidity traders. <b>Market</b> <b>maker?s</b> learning from the trades, i. e., price experimentation, has been studied previously by considering the <b>market</b> <b>maker?s</b> use of only the bid and ask prices. We introduce a framework {{that takes into account}} the use of bid and ask depths, in addition to the bid and ask prices, in explaining the price discovery by a monopolistic <b>market</b> <b>maker.</b> We use a dynamic programming model to show that the <b>market</b> <b>maker</b> experiments with prices and depths in the earlier rounds of trading, then recoups any losses in later rounds. According to the model, the <b>market</b> <b>maker</b> only learns about the true value of the security when informed traders are trading. The <b>market</b> <b>maker</b> attempts to encourage informed trading in the ޲st round, when information asymmetry is high. Since informed traders prefer to trade in large sizes and liquidity traders prefer to trade when the spread is narrow, the specialist encourages informed trading by widening the spread and increasing the depth. In the second period, the <b>market</b> <b>maker</b> faces less information asymmetry, since prices already reflect the private infor- mation obtained in the ޲st round. Therefore, the specialist sets narrower spreads, making the market more attractive to liquidity traders. Thus, our model predicts that when information asymmetry declines, the <b>market</b> <b>maker</b> simultaneously reduces both spreads and depths. Further, {{as a consequence of the}} <b>market</b> <b>maker?s</b> actions, both depths and spreads exhibit large variations from one quote to the next.

40|$|Models {{of market}} {{microstructure}} {{tell us that}} a spread is necessary to compensate <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> for <b>order</b> processing costs, inventory risk, and adverse selection. Since entry into market making is relatively easy on the Nasdaq dealer market, and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) specialist faces competition from public liquidity suppliers {{as well as from}} regional exchanges, competition should at least theoretically lead to spreads that are just large enough to cover these costs. This is, of course, provided that spreads are free to adjust to reflect the economic costs of providing liquidity. However, to economize on negotiation costs between buyers and sellers, equity markets have traditionally stipulated a minimum tick size. A min-imum tick size reduces the ability of the spread to adjust downwards, potentially re-sulting in excess trading costs and excess profits to <b>market</b> <b>makers.</b> 2 While the tick size in US equity markets had remained one-eighth since the found-ing of the NYSE in 1792, 3 the costs for providing liquidity had come down consid-erably {{by the end of the}} 1990 s, both due to technological innovation, improved access to information, and improved liquidity.

Spot market power thus creates a moral hazard problem which parallels the adverse selection problem in models with inside information. This moral hazard not only reduces the optimal amount of hedging for those with and without market power, but also makes complete hedging impossible. When <b>market</b> <b>makers</b> cannot distinguish <b>orders</b> placed by those with and without market power, market power provides a venue for strategic trading and market manipulation. The monopolist will strategically randomize his futures market position and then use his market power to make this position pro 8 ̆ 5 table.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} there exist {{differences}} in the performances of individual NYSE specialists {{in terms of the}} execution costs and participation strategies to the posted quotes and trades. We find that quoted and effective spreads, quoted depth, and number of trades that receive price improvement differ significantly across individual specialists. The explanatory power of the model as measured by adjusted R 2 increases when we include the individual specialist dummies. Evidence suggests that some of the differences across specialist firms documented in the previous literature are due to the differences in individual specialists. We find that, as the trading frequency increases, order processing costs increase for the portfolios of the individual specialists which implies that specialists use profits from active stocks to subsidize inactive stocks in their portfolios. Using 2001 NYSE System Order Data in the decimal pricing environment, we also show that individual NYSE specialists differ significantly in their participation strategies to the posted quotes and trades. This suggests that there are significant differences in execution costs between specialists because they use different quoting and trading strategies.

For the order book, trade size clustering is not associated with differences in transaction costs nor with differences in the information content of trades. For the off-book market, trades in clustered (popular) sizes carry significantly more information than non-clustered trades. Despite the significant differences in the price impact estimates between the order book and off-book, we show that traders placing large orders off-book are still better off than trading via the order book as they benefit from a large discount from the current midpoint price.
