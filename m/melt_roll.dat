The lake developed only about 60 years ago (1948 is mentioned), when the entire area was less than 100 ft of glacier, which was only 250 yard m from the Atlantic Ocean, and 2 mi away from Vatnajökull. Vatnajökull was at the shore line of the ocean and dropped icebergs into the ocean.

40|$|Abstract. The {{disadvantages}} {{of the conventional}} twin-roll caster for aluminum alloy are low casting speeds and limited choices of alloys that are castable by this processing. It is known that strip casting of aluminum alloy 5182 is very difficult because of their wider freezing zones.

Recently, BCAST at Brunel University has {{developed}} a MCAST (melt conditioning by advanced shear technology) process for conditioning liquid metal at temperature either above or bellow the alloy liquidus using a high shear twin-screw mechanism.

During the MC-TRC process, liquid alloy with a specified temperature is continuously fed into the MCAST machine.

40|$|Low-temperature colossal {{supersaturation}} (LTCSS) {{is a novel}} {{surface hardening}} method for carburization of austenitic stainless steels (SS) without the precipitation of carbides. The formation of carbides is kinetically suppressed, enabling extremely high or colossal carbon supersaturation. As a result, surface carbon concentrations in excess of 12 at. % are routinely achieved. This treatment increases the surface hardness {{by a factor of}} four to five, improving resistance to wear, corrosion, and fatigue, with significant retained ductility. LTCSS is a diffusional surface hardening process that provides a uniform and conformal hardened gradient surface with no risk of delamination or peeling. The treatment retains the austenitic phase and is completely non-magnetic. In addition, because parts are treated at low temperature, they do not distort or change dimensions. During this treatment, carbon diffusion proceeds into the metal at temperatures that constrain substitutional diffusion or mobility between the metal alloy elements. Though immobilized and unable to assemble to form carbides, chromium and similar alloying elements nonetheless draw enormous amounts of carbon into their interstitial spaces. The carbon in the interstitial spaces of the alloy crystals makes the surface harder than ever achieved before by more conventional heat treating or diffusion process. The carbon solid solution manifests a Vickers hardness often exceeding 1000 HV (equivalent to 70 HRC). This project objective was to extend the LTCSS treatment to other austenitic alloys, and to quantify improvements in fatigue, corrosion, and wear resistance. Highlights from the research include the following: • Extension of the applicability of the LTCSS process to a broad range of austenitic and duplex grades of steels • Demonstration of LTCSS ability for a variety of different component shapes and sizes • Detailed microstructural characterization of LTCSS-treated samples of 316 L and other alloys • Thermodynamic modeling to explain the high degree of carbon solubility possible in austenitic grades under the LTCSS process and experimental validation of model results • Corrosion testing to determine the corrosion resistance improvement possible from the LTCSS process • Erosion testing to determine the erosion resistance improvement possible from the LTCSS process • Wear testing to quantify the wear resistance improvement possible from the LTCSS process • Fatigue testing for quantifying the extent of improvement from the LTCSS process • Component treating and testing under simulated and in-line commercial operations XRD verified expanded austenite lattice, with no evidence of carbide precipitation. Carbon concentration profiles via Auger and electron dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) showed carbon levels in excess of 12 at. % in treated, type 316 SS. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of pulled-to-failure treated tensile specimens showed slip bands and no de-cohesion of the treated layer, verifying that the layer remains ductile. Compressive stresses in excess of 2 GPa (300 ksi) have been calculated at the surface of the case. Phase diagram (CALPHAD) (ThermoCalc) and Wagner dilute solution thermodynamic models were developed that calculate the solubility of carbon in austenite as a function of alloying content for the process time and temperature. Several commercial alloys have been modeled, and the model has been used to design experimental alloys with enhanced affinity for carbon solubility at treatment temperatures. Four experimental alloys were <b>melted,</b> <b>rolled,</b> and manufactured into test specimens, and the LTCSS treatment indicated successfully enhanced results and validated the predictions based on thermodynamic modeling. Electrochemical polarization curves show a 600 to 800 mV increase in pitting potential in treated (900 - 1000 mV) versus non-treated (200 - 300 mV) type 316 in chloride solutions. Treated 316 L showed crevice-corrosion behavior similar to that of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and Hastelloy C 22. Cavitation tests showed significant increases in cavitation resistance for treated materials as compared to the non-treated materials. Standard ASTM pin-on-disk sliding friction and reciprocating friction wear tests also indicate significant enhancement in wear properties. Fatigue testing showed an order of magnitude improvement for treated versus non-treated Type 316 at the same maximum stress level (R = - 1). The maximum stress at 107 cycles and the endurance stress for infinite life, improved by approximately 50 %, from 30 to 45 ksi. The energy savings from this project is estimated at 21. 8 trillion Btu/year by 2020. This energy savings will be associated with a CO 2 reduction of 1. 3 million ton/year.

40|$|In {{the present}} study the effect of <b>melt</b> {{spinning}} <b>roll</b> speed on mean grain size and magnetic properties of near stoichiometric Nd-Fe-B alloy ribbons is investigated. A decrease in the ribbon thickness and mean Nd_ 2 Fe_ 1 _ 4 B grain size and improvement in magnetic properties, including remanence enhancement, were observed on increasing the roll speed, prior to vitrification and consequent collapse of properties at higher speeds. The effect of roll speed and also annealing temperature on the microstructure and the magnetic properties and hysteresis loops of the stoichiometric alloy were studied and {{it was found that}} optimum nanostructure and magnetic properties could be achieved for a range of roll speeds and annealing temperatures which makes it an attractive route for commercial production of this alloy. The effect of 0 - 3 at. % Ga substitution for Fe in the stoichiometric alloy of composition Fe_ 8 _ 2 _. _ 3 Nd_ 1 _ 1 _. _ 8 B_ 5 _. _ 9, produced by both optimally quenching and over- quenching and annealing were studied and compared. Broadly, comparable results for both sets with some improvement in coercivity were observed for up to 2 at. % Ga addition. The effect of 0 - 3 at. % Ga substitution for Fe were also investigated in overquenched and optimally annealed substoichiometric alloy of composition Fe_ 8 _ 5 _. _ 1 Nd_ 9 B_ 5 _. _ 9 and were compared with those achieved for ribbons prepared by optimally quenched route. Inferior magnetic properties especially for _jH_c and (BH) _m_a_x, were observed for over-quenched and annealed alloys compared with those prepared by directly quenching. The Ga addition did however result in some improvement in _jH_c and (BH) _m_a_x, especially for the directly quenched alloy containing 1. 5 at. % Ga. The microstructure of ribbon samples were studied extensively by TEM and, in addition to normal polygonal Nd_ 2 Fe_ 1 _ 4 B grains, other more unusual morphologies such as spherical and plate like grains, were found in a number of samples. Various grain size distributions were also observed. Texture and the orientation relationship between #alpha#-Fe precipitates and Nd_ 2 Fe_ 1 _ 4 B matrix were studied in the near stoichiometric sample containing 3 at. % Ga, melt spun at low roll speeds, and an attempt was made to identify additional phases observed in this sample. Some dislocation-type features found in some samples were also studied.

40|$|Peritectic carbon steels, {{produced}} by conventional continuous casting, show slab surface defects {{as a consequence}} of the shrinkage caused by the delta-gamma transformation. Unsteady heat flux conditions between strand shell and mould plate leads to an irregular solidification. By following the hypothesis, that the cooling rate has an effect to the peritectic reaction, twin roll strip cast trials were done at a pilot strip caster at RWTH Aachen University. Local cooling rates of - 1000 K/s in combination with an eightfold higher heat flux compared to continuous casting are typical for strip casting process. The indication for effects from the strip casting process to the peritectic reaction was on the one hand the steady heat flux and on the other hand the strip surface quality. Trials were performed in 3 campaigns with the chemical analyses of peritectic carbon steels known from continuous casting. The campaigns just distinguish between the casting roll surfaces structure and the range of carbon content. All other process parameters were constant. The casting roll surface was developed from a fine, hexagonal open structure to a coarse hexagonal structure. The structure is regular and was {{produced by}} knurling. The carbon range was 0. 06 to 0. 17 wt %. The result of the 1 st campaign was that nearly all strips were attack by many cracks. The number of cracks rises to higher carbon content up to 0. 17 wt %. The maximum of defects around 0. 1 wt % of carbon, known from continuous casting, was not found. By proofing the strip surfaces, it was found out that the steel melt didn’t wet the roll surface intensive. An unsteady solidification process was the result. The results of the 2 nd campaign were different. Just very few cracks were remaining at the strip surfaces. No dependence between carbon content and number of crack were found. Once again the critical range around 0. 1 wt % carbon wasn’t noticeable by strips produced with the twin roll casting process. The important different in comparison to the first campaign was an excellent wetting behaviour between steel <b>melt</b> and <b>roll</b> surface. An imprint of the roll surface structure was found at all strip surfaces. A homogenous heat flux and solidification condition exists. The results of the 3 rd series, performed with a further regular roll surface structure, confirm the above explained facts. The geometric shape and adjustment were again diversifying to coarser values. The work could demonstrate that the twin roll process is suitable for the production of peritectic carbon steel grades. The key factor for solidification and heat flux is the wetting condition at the roll surface. Steel specific roll surface structures are required...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho propõe uma metodologia para avaliar pontualmente as variações de tenacidade à fratura e taxa de crescimento de trinca de fadiga ao longo da camada cementada de um aço SAE 4320. A pequena espessura dessas camadas impede a retirada de corpos de prova nas dimensões especificadas pelas normas de ensaios de tenacidade à fratura. Assim, para simular uma camada cementada retirou-se amostras de aços SAE 43 xx variando-se apenas teor de carbono de 0, 20 a 1, 00 %. Os corpos de prova após eletrodeposição de cobre foram tratados termicamente numa carga de cementação, têmpera e revenimento para serem submetidos aos efeitos térmicos sem absorção de carbono. Os resultados da análise microestrutural, dos ensaios de microdureza, de tração e de tenacidade à fratura e de taxa de crescimento de trinca de fadiga foram agrupados em um único gráfico e comparados com o perfil de cementação de peças de aço SAE 4320 tratadas nas mesmas condições. Foi confirmado que as propriedades de fadiga variam de forma inversamente proporcional à microdureza (HV 1) e que a previsão do comportamento de uma trinca numa camada cementada pode ser feita por meio de equação ou diagrama que relacionam a microdureza HV 1 com a tenacidade à fratura ou taxa de crescimento de trinca de fadiga (KIC ou da/dN x ??) The {{purpose of}} this work is to propose a {{methodology}} for evaluating the crack growth rate and the fracture toughness along the SAE 4320 steel carburized layer. Due to the small thickness of those layers, {{it is impossible to}} machine specimens from those layers in accordance with standards. For simulating the microstructures of the carburized layer in order to get samples for tensile and the fracture toughness testing, specimens of SAE 43 xx, from 0. 20 %C to 1. 00 %C, steels melted in vacuum induction <b>melting,</b> hot <b>rolled</b> and have been machined, assuming the local influence just the variation of the content of carbon and considering that the contents of the other alloy elements are essentially constant. The specimens after electroplated copper layer were heat treated in an industrial load of carburizing, quenching, and tempering for they be submitted to the thermal effects without absorption of carbon. The results of the microstructure analysis and microhardness, crack growth rate, and the fracture toughness tests were placed in a single graph and compared with the profile of the carburizing of the steel SAE 4320 heat treated in the same conditions. It was confirmed that the crack growth rate and the fracture toughness varies inversely proportional to the microhardness (HV 1) and that the forecast of the behavior of a crack in a carburized layer can be made through equation or it designs that relate the microhardness (HV 1) with the fracture toughness (KIC or CTODC) and crack growth rate (da/dN X ??...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Rapid {{solidification}} (RS) of metallic melts {{is important}} {{for the development of the}} advance metallic materials, because enables the production of new alloys with superior properties according to conventionally treated alloys. In practice it turned out, that single <b>roll</b> <b>melt</b> spinning process has one of the highest melt cooling rates among all continuous casting processes. But, because very short solidification time and movement of the melt and substrate, melt cooling rate is very difficult to measure with confidence. Primary goal of our work was to determine the limits of cooling rate over the ribbon thickness and to outline, which property or typical feature of the process has the greatest influence on cooling rate of the melt. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of developed mathematical model, a computer program was made and used for melt cooling rate calculation in the melt-spinning process. Findings: The calculations show that distance from the contact surface in relation to the thermal properties of the melt, chilling wheel material and contact resistance between metal melt and chilling wheel have the greatest influence on melt/ribbon cooling rate. In the case of continuous casting, significant “long term” surface temperature increase may take place, if the wheel is not internally cooled. Research limitations/implications: Influence of the melt physical properties, chill wheel material, contact resistance and cooling mode of the chill wheel on melt cooling rate are outlined. Practical implications: Practical limits of melt cooling rate over ribbon thickness are outlined and directions for the chill wheel cooling system design are indicated. Originality/value: Comparison between cooling rates calculated at various thermal resistance assumptions of particular constituents is outlined. New method for determining contact resistance through variable heat transfer coefficient is introduced which takes into account physical properties of the casting material, process parameters and contact time/length between metal melt/ribbon and substrate and enables cooling rate prediction before the experiment execution. In the case of continuous casting, heat balance of the melt-spinning process is calculated and influence of the chill wheel cooling mode on cooling rate of metallic ribbon is analyzed...|$|R
6000|$|Grand-Duke Franz {{had seen}} war, under Seckendorf, under Wallis and otherwise, in the {{disastrous}} Turk Countries; but, though willing enough, was never {{much of a}} soldier: as to Neipperg, among his own men especially, the one cry is, He ought to go about his business out of Austrian Armies, as an imbecile and even a traitor. [...] "Is it conceivable that Friedrich could have beaten us, in that manner, except by buying Neipperg in the first place? Neipperg and the generality of them, in that luckless Silesian Business? Glogau scaladed {{with the loss of}} half a dozen men; Brieg gone within a week; Neisse ditto: and Mollwitz, above all, where, in spite of Romer and such Horse-charging as was never seen, we had to <b>melt,</b> dissolve, and <b>roll</b> away in the glitter of the evening sun!" [...] The common notion is, they are traitors, partial-traitors, one and all. [Guerre de Boheme, saepius.] Poor Neipperg he has seen hard service, had ugly work to do: it was he that gave away Belgrade to the Turks (so interpreting his orders), and the Grand Vizier, calling him Dog of a Giaour: spat in his face, not far from hanging him; and the Kaiser and Vienna people, on his coming home, threw him into prison, and were near cutting off his head. And again, after such sleety marchings through the Mountains, he has had to dissolve at Mollwitz; float away in military deluge in the manner we saw. And now, next winter, here is he lodged among the upland bogs at Budweis, escorted by mere curses. What a life is the soldier's, like other men's; what a master is the world! Aulic Cabinet is not all-wise; but may readily be wiser than the vulgar, and, with a Maria Theresa at his head, it is incapable of truculent impiety like that. Neipperg, guilty of not being a Eugene, is not hanged as a traitor; but placed quietly as Commandant in Luxemburg, spends there the afternoon of his life, in a more commodious manner. Friedrich had, of late, rather admired his movements on the Neisse River; and found him a stiff article to deal with.|$|R
