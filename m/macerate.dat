5|$|Many wasp lineages, {{including}} those in the families Vespidae, Crabronidae, Sphecidae, and Pompilidae, attack and sting prey items that they use as food for their larvae; while Vespidae usually <b>macerate</b> their prey and feed the resulting bits directly to their brood, most predatory wasps paralyze their prey and lay eggs directly upon the bodies, and the wasp larvae consume them. Apart from collecting prey items to provision their young, many wasps are also opportunistic feeders, and will suck the body fluids of their prey. Although vespid mandibles are adapted for chewing and {{they appear to be}} feeding on the organism, they are often merely macerating it into submission. The impact of the predation of wasps on economic pests is difficult to establish.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} about the paper's {{manufacture}} in the pre-Hispanic period. Stone beaters dating from the 6th century CE have been found, and these tools are most often found where amate trees grow. Most are made of volcanic stone with some made of marble and granite. They are usually rectangular or circular with grooves on one or both sides to <b>macerate</b> the fibers. These beaters are still used by Otomi artisans, and almost all are volcanic, with an additional groove added on the side to help hold the stone. According to some early Spanish accounts, the bark was left overnight in water to soak, after which the finer inner fibers were separated from coarser outer fibers and pounded into flat sheets. But it is not known who did the work, or how the labor was divided.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Unconditioned and <b>macerated</b> alfalfa samples at {{approximately}} 55 and 80 % moisture wet basis (w. b.) were incubated at 11 and 31 °C for 48 h {{and rates of}} CO 2 respired from each sample were measured. Production of CO 2 from unconditioned alfalfa samples appeared {{to be due to}} plant cell respiration while production of CO 2 from the <b>macerated</b> alfalfa samples appeared to be due primarily to microbial growth. Typically, the initial respiration rates of the <b>macerated</b> samples were less than the control samples. When the samples were incubated at 31 °C, the rates of CO 2 production from the <b>macerated</b> samples increased exponentially to approximately four times that of the control samples 6 to 20 h after the samples had been <b>macerated.</b> Consequently, the cumulative loss of DM from the <b>macerated</b> samples during the first 12 h of incubation was less than that of the control samples; however, after 12 h of incubation, loss of DM from the <b>macerated</b> samples increased to nearly twice the level of the control samples.

40|$|Introduction: The {{addition}} of herbs into hot sesame oil {{could increase the}} oil-pulling efficiency of sesame oil. The aim of {{present study was to}} modify the proportion of herbs and sesame oil with the {{addition of}} other ingredients including menthol, camphor, and borneol and improve the medicinal properties and the scent of the oil. Methods: <b>Macerated</b> herbal oil was prepared by heat extraction of five species of herbs (Zingiber cassumunar, Zingiber zerumbet, Plantago major Linn, Citrus hystrix, and Amomum biflorum) with hot sesame oil. The study was performed to evaluate the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-bacterial properties of this <b>macerated</b> herbal oil. Results: <b>Macerated</b> herbal oil was evaluated for antioxidant activity using DPPH and ABTS assays. It was shown that at dilution 1 : 2 in DMSO, the <b>macerated</b> herbal oil had DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities equal to 63 % and 22 %, respectively. <b>Macerated</b> herbal oil dilution 1 : 8 in DMSO demonstrated ferric reducing capacity equivalent to ascorbic acid (0. 208 µM) and had reducing power equivalent to butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) 7. 41 µg/mL. MTT assay was performed using immortalized human mesenchymal stem cells (HMSCs) as a cell culture model. The result indicated that the cytotoxic concentration of the <b>macerated</b> herbal oil was ≥ 2. 5 µL/mL in complete DMEM. Anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated using the nitrite assay and RT-PCR. It was found that the <b>macerated</b> herbal oil could inhibit nitrite accumulation in culture media. Change in the expression of COX- 2, Nrf 2, and NF-kB in RT-PCR confirmed the anti-inflammatory activity of the <b>macerated</b> herbal oil. Conclusion: It could be concluded that the <b>macerated</b> herbal oil could inhibit nitrite accumulation in culture media, which might be the inhibitory effect of the <b>macerated</b> herbal oil on COX- 2 or Nrf 2, the downstream modulator of the COX- 2 pathway. Further intensive studies are needed for the optimization before bringing this <b>macerated</b> herbal oil into clinical application...|$|R
25|$|Brut Rose Champagnes {{came along}} in the 1990s, a version as dry as regular Brut Champagne. They are {{produced}} either by leaving the clear juice of black grapes to <b>macerate</b> on its skins {{for a brief time}} (known as the saignée method) or, more commonly, by adding a small amount of still Pinot Noir red wine to the sparkling wine cuvée. Champagne is typically light in colour even if it is produced with red grapes, because the juice is extracted from the grapes using a gentle process that minimizes the amount of time the juice spends in contact with the skins, which is what gives red wine its colour. Rosé Champagne {{is one of the few}} wines that allow the production of Rosé by the addition of a small amount of red wine during blending. This ensures a predictable and reproducible colour, allowing a constant Rosé colour from year-to-year. Popular in many countries and especially well-welcomed in Estonia where it was first introduced by an Estonian entrepreneur Henry-Jörgen Rautits, pink Champagne is very popular amongst high-end restaurants due to its soft yet sensitive taste, which is highly appreciated by wealthier customers.|$|E
500|$|The {{technique}} for producing black tea was first {{developed during the}} late Ming Dynasty Wuyishan, Fujian either resulting from the over-oxidation of tea-leaves during the manufacture of oolong tea [...] or indirectly from the methods of manufacturing green and white teas. In the early 1600s, tea producers in the Wuyi Mountains began kneading the sun-withered tea leaves to <b>macerate</b> them, then allowed them to dry under the sun, thus reaching full oxidation and producing [...] "Gongfu" [...] black tea (工夫紅茶). When there was insufficient sun and temperatures were low, the withered leaves would be processed indoors in warmed rooms and allowed to fully oxidize, then smoked dry over pine fires thus producing lapsang souchong. According to oral traditions of the region, the discovery of lapsang souchong processing was due to military troops passing through a Wuyi's tea factory during {{the last years of}} the Ming Dynasty, causing delays to tea leaf processing thus resulting in a completely oxidized leaf that the producer salvaged by drying over a fire built from pine branches. By the Qing Dynasty, both lapsang souchong and gongfu black tea were well recognized in China and noted in [...] "Records on Yiwu mountain" [...] (武夷山志) by the scholar Dong Tiangong (董天工).|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} impossible to collect blood or to culture tissue from a <b>macerated</b> stillborn fetus.

In the East Flanders Prospective Twin Study, placental tissue of twin and triplet sets, in some of which one or both members were stillborn and <b>macerated,</b> has been stored at - 20 degrees C. Of all these fetuses, sex and zygosity could be determined accurately on the placental deoxyribonucleic acid. We tested the possibility of nongenetic changes in deoxyribonucleic acid that result from maceration or tissue degradation over time in storage on placental samples from monochorionic twins in which only one member was stillborn and <b>macerated.</b> The deoxyribonucleic acid variants in these monozygotic twins were identical whether or not either cotwin was <b>macerated.</b> Thus deoxyribonucleic acid variants can be determined accurately on the placental tissue of <b>macerated</b> fetuses, even after prolonged freezing. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Five feeding {{studies were}} {{conducted}} with 141 lactating Holstein cows comparing <b>macerated</b> and control alfalfa silage harvested at two cuttings in each of 2 yr. Overall, silage made from <b>macerated</b> alfalfa contained more ash (suggesting improved soil contamination); greater fiber and lower nonprotein nitrogen (NPN) content suggested greater fermentation in the silo. In a digestion study, two diets were fed containing [dry matter (DM) basis] 72 % of either control or <b>macerated</b> second-cutting alfalfa. Apparent digestibility of neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber (ADF) was increased by maceration, and similar changes in digestibility were observed with Yb or indigestible ADF as marker; indigestible ADF {{was used as a}} marker in later studies.
