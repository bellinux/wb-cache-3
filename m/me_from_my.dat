5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the stereo and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E

500|$|It is {{unlawful}} {{to designate}} the Armenian assets as [...] "abandoned goods" [...] for the Armenians, the proprietors, did not abandon their properties voluntarily; they were forcibly, compulsorily {{removed from their}} domiciles and exiled. Now the government through its efforts is selling their goods... Nobody can sell my property if I am unwilling to sell it. Article 21 of the Constitution forbids it. If we are a constitutional regime functioning in accordance with constitutional law we can't do this. This is atrocious. Grab my arm, eject <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> village, then sell my goods and properties, such a thing can never be permissible. Neither {{the conscience of the}} Ottomans nor the law can allow it.|$|E

500|$|Isie was an {{intelligent}} young woman who, like Smuts, had scored highly in her Matriculation exam. It was thought, as a girl, {{a future in}} higher education was largely closed to her. The time spent in her company, whether reading poetry and singing together at the piano, or walking together in the mornings and evenings on the journey to and from Victoria College, did much to break down Smuts's social isolation, enabling him to cast some of those protective prejudices which he had harboured of the [...] "puerile element", {{that is to say}} his peers. As he wrote in his diary some years later: [...] ", less idealistic than I, but more human, recalled <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> intellectual isolation and made me return to my fellows." ...|$|E

[...] "They are two totally different types of personalities. Bob is a statesman, and I love that. Jean will get in your face in a heartbeat, and I like that too," [...] said Burress. Also running were Deborah A. Kraus, who worked for the West Clermont school district's computer services department, and James E. Constable, who ran to protest the care his disabled son received from a state hospital.|$|E
500|$|The new couple {{lived in}} Godwick Manor, their peace {{disturbed}} in 1776 when Wenman's health began to fail. He finally died on 10 April after [...] "a constipation which medicine could not remove", leaving Coke {{in charge of}} a 30,000 acre estate at the age of 22. Soon after his father's death, Harbord and other senior Whigs visited Coke and asked him to stand for Norfolk in his father's stead. Coke was not enthusiastic, not seeing himself as a politician and hoping to enjoy his new estates and wealth, but after his visitors pointed out a Tory might otherwise replace him [...] "my blood chilled all over <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> head to my foot, and I came forward". On 12 April he issued a manifesto to the Norfolk electorate, soon returning to campaign, and after being unanimously nominated on 27 April he was elected in May.|$|E

"To Zion," [...] {{among the}} more introspective tracks on the album, spoke about how Hill's family comes before her career and her {{decision}} to have her first child, even though many at the time encouraged her to abort the pregnancy, so as to not conflict with her burgeoning career. In an interview she discussed the song's origin and significance, commenting [...] "Names wouldn't come when I was ready to have him. The only name that came to me was Zion. I was like, 'is Zion {{too much of a}} weight to carry?' But this little boy, man. I would say he personally delivered <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> emotional and spiritual drought. He just replenished my newness. When he was born, I felt like I was born again." [...] She further stated: [...] "I wanted it to be a revolutionary song about a spiritual movement, and also about my spiritual change, going {{from one place to another}} because of my son." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Kill the Lights" [...] is {{an urban}} and dance-pop song that alludes to Spears {{conflict}} with the paparazzi, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "Mr. Photographer / I think I'm ready for my close-up / Tonight / Make sure you catch <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> good side". Jon Pareles of The New York Times said the song features [...] "amid electronic blips and ominous artificial strings and horns", while Spears [...] "alternately invites photographers closer and fends them off. 'They all wanna see', she warns prospective stars. 'Is life {{going to get the}} best of you?'". [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] features a similar theme to Spears' [...] "Piece of Me" [...] (2007) and was considered its sequel, while Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone said the song [...] "recalls the synth crush of 2007's Blackout." [...] Music critics criticized the fact that Spears is introduced by Danja as [...] "Our very own Pop princess / Now Queen of Pop", commenting that the honorific nickname [...] "Queen of Pop" [...] is attributed to American recording artist Madonna, while describing her vocals as heavily produced.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Torres {{began the}} season as a backup outfielder again. On April 25, he {{replaced}} Eugenio Vélez (who had been filling in for the injured Aaron Rowand) as the Giants' center fielder, playing six games until Rowand's return on May 1. Upon Rowand's return, Torres returned to a reserve role until May 9, {{when he became a}} starting outfielder {{for the rest of the}} season after Mark DeRosa hurt his wrist. On May 30, he had a game-ending RBI single in the 10th inning against Carlos Rosa to give the Giants a 65 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. By midseason, he had replaced Rowand as the Giants' everyday center fielder and leadoff hitter. After the Giants blew a 92 lead over the Florida Marlins on July 28, Torres had a game-ending single in the 10th inning against Clay Hensley to give the Giants a 109 win. After the Giants blew a 73 lead on August 12, Torres had a game-ending RBI single against Andrew Cashner in the ninth inning to give the Giants an 87 victory over the Chicago Cubs. On the morning of September 12, Torres woke up with severe stomach pain and was diagnosed with appendicitis. He underwent an appendectomy the same day. He returned to the lineup roughly two weeks later, and on October 1 it was announced that he had won the 2010 Willie Mac Award. Torres said upon receiving the award, [...] "It's the best. It's an honor for <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> teammates. I've been blessed and I'm happy and just thank God for everything, putting me here and these guys treating me like a family." [...] In 139 games (507 at bats), Torres hit [...]268 with 84 runs scored, 136 hits, 16 home runs, and 63 RBI. He ranked fourth in the NL in doubles (43, behind Jayson Werth's 46 and Matt Holliday's and Ryan Braun's 45) and ranked seventh in the NL in triples (eight). He finished the year having led the Giants in stolen bases with 26.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Newton did accept and acknowledge, in all {{editions of the}} 'Principia', that Hooke (but not {{exclusively}} Hooke) had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system.

2500|$|Ould Taya, on his {{way back}} from Fahd's funeral, landed in Niamey, the capital of Niger. He met Niger's {{president}} Mamadou Tandja before going to a villa in Niamey. Speaking to Radio France Internationale on August 5, Ould Taya condemned the coup, saying that there had [...] "never been a more senseless coup in Africa" [...] and that it reminded him of the adage [...] "God save <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> friends, I'll take care of my enemies". On August 8, he unsuccessfully attempted to order the armed forces to restore him to power. Broad support for the coup appeared to exist across the country; Ould Taya's own PRDS party abandoned him {{a few days after the}} coup by endorsing the new regime's transitional plan. International reaction to Ould Taya's overthrow was initially strongly hostile, including the suspension of Mauritania from the African Union, but after several days the new rulers were apparently diplomatically successful in winning tacit international acceptance of their transitional regime. The United States in particular at first called for Ould Taya to be restored to power but subsequently backed away from this.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{his arrival}} in Paris, Bourguiba settled in Vauqueur pension who {{reserved}} him a sordid welcoming. The pension was nearby Hôtel Saint-Séverin, next to Place Saint-Michel, {{where he used to}} lodge in a room on the sixth floor for 150 francs per month, with an extra for a heater that did not work. He spent his first months wandering in hotels in Quartier latin and Tunisian student's dormitories. Preferring to attend philosophical classes, Bourguiba sent his notes to his brother M'hamed and excelled in his studies. Interested in Arab culture, he attend William Marçais's lessons beside his psychological and psychotherapy interest in George Dumas's conference, in hôpital Saint-Anne. Furthermore, he met, in the hospital, paranoias who thought they were Napoleon or other historical personalities. [...] "I felt then that euphoria of knowledge that increases as our research extends", he recalled in 1973. [...] "However, I ended realising that I did not come to France for that purpose, but rather to arm myself intellectually to combat the French colonization. Therefore, I was determined {{to put an end to}} these parallel endless studies that diverted <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> goals".|$|E
2500|$|While in Belgrade, Kočić met {{the writer}} Janko Veselinović, whose popular {{short stories and}} novels romanticized Serbian peasant life. Kočić shared several of his poems with Veselinović. The latter {{recommended}} that he focus on prose instead. Kočić's time in Belgrade was marked by dire poverty. [...] "Although Serbian," [...] he wrote, the city was [...] "a foreign world". His behaviour became extremely volatile, as seen in a letter he wrote his childhood friend and future wife Milka Vukmanović, threatening to kill her and then himself if she married another. Letters to his father, pressing for money, also struck an abusive and manipulative tone. The thought of committing suicide began to appear more frequently in his notes. [...] "I will kill myself," [...] he wrote, [...] "to put an end {{once and for all}} to all the sufferings and torments that have pursued <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> birth. My life in Banja Luka was hard and dark, in Sarajevo still worse, and in Belgrade it reached the very climax of suffering."
