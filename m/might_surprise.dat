5|$|Everyone I {{talked to}} {{seemed to have}} a {{relative}} or a friend who'd been through it. That was the other thing – everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing her now <b>might</b> <b>surprise</b> some people because in the past she's been such a strong character and here she is collapsed and weeping and thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the script editor that you don't think your character will react a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation.|$|E
500|$|Mark Beaumont of NME {{praised the}} album, writing that [...] "by {{the time the}} {{affecting}} acoustic lament 'Butterfly' wafts in like Big Star at a wildlife protection meeting, Pinkerton starts feeling like a truly moving album." [...] Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork awarded the album 7.5 out of 10, writing that [...] "Pinkerton might actually be a bit much for fans who were wooed with the clean production and immediately accessible sound of these guys' debut, but if given a chance, it <b>might</b> <b>surprise</b> even some anti-Weezer folk." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Real and True" [...] is a pop and R song, {{the lyrics}} of which {{describe}} an everlasting love. During the chorus, Cyrus and Mr. Hudson sing the lyrics [...] "When the sun dies and the stars fade from view / Our love will remain real and true / Through the distance and cold depths of space / The radio sings our song / It's a love real and true". Carolyn Menyes from MusicTimes noted that the artists' vocals heavily relied on Auto-Tune technology, which she credited with providing a [...] "cohesive sound throughout the track". Future suggested that [...] "Real and True" [...] was lyrically inspired by his fiancée, American recording artist Ciara, commenting [...] "it <b>might</b> <b>surprise</b> people what I'm saying 'cause I'm speaking on my relationship and everything I'm going through right now and trying to capture that moment." [...] "Real and True" [...] was produced by Mike Will Made It, who frequently collaborates with Cyrus and Future.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Breare and {{his home}} guard unit {{had arrived in}} Newton, and upon hearing what was happening, Breare {{immediately}} {{took charge of the}} town's defense. [...] Breare wanted to keep the defenders close to the square, so that they <b>might</b> <b>surprise</b> Sanders and catch him amidst Newton's buildings and streets, leaving him less room to maneuver. [...] Accordingly, he formed his men {{on the west side of}} the square, opposite of the direction that Carmichael believed that Sanders would be coming.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I <b>might</b> <b>surprise</b> you. Mycroft draws {{four hundred}} and fifty pounds a year, remains a subordinate, has no ambitions of any kind, will receive neither honour nor title, but remains the most {{indispensable}} man in the country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He was," [...] Mr. Barclay assented. [...] "I {{was afraid}} he <b>might</b> <b>surprise</b> you, but we couldn't shout and warn you without {{alarming}} him, which I didn't want to do {{for one or two}} reasons. We'll wait here until he's through with the business that brought him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "An' wot {{about the}} widders and horphans?" [...] inquired Tommy, {{beginning}} to smoke, and using his extremely little finger as a tobacco-stopper {{in a way}} that <b>might</b> have <b>surprised</b> a salamander.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{chances are}} that they will sit and talk all night. Of course, we <b>might</b> <b>surprise</b> the sentry, {{but it would be}} a great risk with those fellows close at hand, and we should have to run {{straight}} for the steps, and might get a dozen balls after us, before we were over the wall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou dost {{propose to}} abduct her, I know that," [...] she said more firmly. [...] "I am no fool, and I {{understand}} I am {{to be the}} decoy. The dark passage, the lonely spot, thy presence there ... and then the occurrence, as thou saidst, that <b>might</b> <b>surprise</b> or frighten me.... I am no fool," [...] she repeated sullenly, [...] "I understand." ...|$|E
60|$|A new sound, a purring {{rustle of}} leaves, stopped me {{instantly}} as I climbed the beech ridge, one late afternoon, {{to see what}} wood folk I <b>might</b> <b>surprise</b> feeding on the rich mast. Pr-r-r-r-ush, pr-r-r-r-ush! a curious combination of the rustling of squirrels' feet and the soft, crackling purr of an eagle's wings, growing nearer, clearer every instant. I slipped quietly behind the nearest tree to watch and listen.|$|E

40|$|One <b>might</b> be <b>surprised</b> to {{find out}} that Stokely Carmichael and Herbert Marcuse spoke at the same conference in 1967. One <b>might</b> be more <b>surprised</b> to learn that both of their talks {{revolved}} around the animation of Frederick Douglass’s act of revolt as a figural point on which their disparate political projects hinged. A potential path not taken in forging an alliance between 60 s Black radicalism and the Western Marxism of its time? Perhaps. But perhaps also a shared philosophical mistake...|$|R
60|$|The news {{which one}} day reached Gabriel, that Bathsheba Everdene {{had left the}} neighbourhood, had an {{influence}} upon him which <b>might</b> have <b>surprised</b> any who never suspected that the more emphatic the renunciation the less absolute its character.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is true, on our royal word," [...] {{said the}} Queen; [...] "he hath kept this a secret even from us, that he <b>might</b> <b>surprise</b> us {{with it at}} this very place and time. I see you are dying of curiosity to know the happy bride. It is Amy Robsart, the same who, {{to make up the}} May-game yesterday, figured in the pageant as the wife of his servant Varney." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your highness," [...] Ahrab interrupted, [...] "I {{had better}} send {{all the others}} in, for they <b>might</b> <b>surprise</b> us. Let these young sahibs hide {{themselves}} again; then we will go in, and I will call in your attendants. Later, when it is dusk, you will plead heat, and come out here with me again, and then I can bring some robes to disguise the sahibs; that is, if your highness has resolved to aid them." ...|$|E
60|$|It seems, as {{we learned}} later, that the villainous Brant had made all {{his plans for}} an attack upon Cherry Valley, and had {{secretly}} gained {{a position on the}} hill to the eastward of the place, counting on waiting there until nightfall, when he <b>might</b> <b>surprise</b> us; but, much to his astonishment, he saw what appeared from the distance to be a large body of well-equipped soldiers evidently making ready for serious work.|$|E
60|$|Emily went {{as late as}} she could, {{that there}} might be the less chance of a tete-a-tete, in which she <b>might</b> be <b>surprised</b> into a {{betrayal}} of her secret: indeed she only started at last when Martyn's impatience had become intolerable.|$|R
25|$|The Germans {{maintained}} {{a fleet of}} Zeppelins that they used for aerial reconnaissance and occasional bombing raids. The planned raid on Sunderland intended to use Zeppelins {{to watch out for}} the British fleet approaching from the north, which <b>might</b> otherwise <b>surprise</b> the raiders.|$|R
6000|$|We <b>might</b> feel <b>surprised</b> {{that the}} above {{conversation}} could {{in any way}} have the remotest connexion with [...] "that farm" [...] of which Mr Shirley was so suddenly reminded, did we {{not know that the}} subject was, in fact, never out of his mind.|$|R
60|$|Nor was it ever too hot, or she {{too busy}} with {{household}} cares, for her to follow him {{to the scene of}} his operations, whatever these might be: she would gladly stand for an hour listening to a consultation with the veterinary about an ailing cow. Her fear was lest some matter of like importance should escape her. She had private conversations with Mr. Manning, that she <b>might</b> <b>surprise</b> her husband by an unsuspected knowledge. Such were her ruses.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if it should," [...] she replied, archly, [...] "just {{consider}} how I <b>might</b> <b>surprise</b> {{him with my}} knowledge of wheat.... Indeed, Mr. Dorn, I am interested. I've {{never been in the}} Bend before--in your desert of wheat. I never before felt the greatness of loving the soil--or caring for it--of growing things from seed. Yet the Bible teaches that, and I read my Bible. Please tell us. The more you say the more I'll like it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The captain made bread pills. [...] "If I {{were like}} you," [...] he said, [...] "when you {{got hold of}} that {{merchant}} in the Gilberts, I <b>might</b> <b>surprise</b> you. You had your chance then; seems to me it's mine now. Turn about's fair play. What kind of mercy did you have on that Gilbert merchant?" [...] he cried, with a sudden stridency. [...] "Not that I blame you. All's fair in love and business," [...] and he laughed again, a little frosty giggle.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I should tire you, and {{somebody}} <b>might</b> <b>surprise</b> us, before I told you half," [...] he answered logically. [...] "You must {{take my word}} that all I did was to resist by force the last effort of an extortioner to complete my ruin. He lent me money, and after I had paid it back nearly twice over he tried to seize the little that remained between me and destitution. There was a fracas and he was shot--though the wound was only trifling." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{suspected}} {{that she had}} been injudicious in starting the topic, and she would rather it were dropped, but she hesitated about giving Aynsley a warning glance. His father <b>might</b> <b>surprise</b> it, and she would have to offer Aynsley an explanation afterward. Getting up, she made the best excuse that occurred to her and went into the house. She knew where the chart was kept, and thought that she might hide it. She was too late, however, because as she took it from a bookcase a servant opened the door.|$|E
60|$|Jack Frost had {{hardened}} {{the snow}} so that Reddy {{no longer had}} to wade through it. He could run on the crust now without breaking through. This made it much easier, so he trotted along swiftly. He had intended to go straight to the Old Pasture, but there suddenly popped into his head a memory of the shelter down in a far corner of the Old Orchard which Farmer Brown's boy had built for Bob White. Probably the Bob White family were there now, and he <b>might</b> <b>surprise</b> them. He would go there first.|$|E

5000|$|Time Lords {{also have}} the ability to {{regenerate}} their bodies when their current body is mortally wounded.
