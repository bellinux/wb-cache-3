25|$|In the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), the {{strategic}} {{importance of the}} Trans-Siberian Railway was seen, though its shortcomings contributed to Russia's defeat in the war. The track was a single track and as such could only allow train travel in one direction. This caused significant strategic and supply difficulties for the Russians, as they could not <b>move</b> <b>resources</b> {{to and from the}} front as quickly as would be necessary, as a goods train carrying supplies, men and ammunition coming from west to east would have to wait in the sidings, whilst troops and injured personnel in a troop train travelling from east to west went along the line. Thus the Japanese were quickly able to advance whilst the Russians were awaiting necessary troops and supplies.|$|E
2500|$|The Ski-Doo {{snowmobile}} {{was originally}} called the [...] "Ski-Dog" [...] because Bombardier meant {{it to be}} a practical vehicle to replace the dogsled for hunters and trappers. By an accident, a painter misinterpreted the name and painted [...] "Ski-Doo" [...] on the first prototype. The public soon discovered that speedy vehicles that could zoom over snow were a lot of fun. Suddenly a new winter sport was born, centred in Quebec. In the first year, Bombardier sold 225Ski-Doos; four years later, 8,210 were sold. But Armand was reluctant to focus too much on the Ski-Doo and <b>move</b> <b>resources</b> away from his all-terrain vehicles. He vividly remembered his earlier business setbacks that forced him to diversify. Armand slowed down promotion of the Ski-Doo line to prevent it from dominating the other company products, while still allowing him to dominate the snowmobile industry. [...] The snowmobiles produced were of exceptional quality and performance, earning a better reputation than the rival Polaris and Arctic Cat brand of motosleds. In1971, Bombardier completed the purchase of the Moto-Ski company.|$|E

5000|$|The {{competitive}} {{process in}} a market economy exerts a sort of pressure that tends to <b>move</b> <b>resources</b> to where they are most needed, and to {{where they can be}} used most efficiently for the economy as a whole. For the competitive process to work however, it is [...] "important that prices accurately signal costs and benefits." [...] Where externalities occur, or monopolistic or oligopolistic conditions persist, or for the provision of certain goods such as public goods, the pressure of the competitive process is reduced.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, the State Department's Inspector General (IG) {{conducted}} {{a review of}} three of these Bureaus: NP, AC, and VC.

This paper investigates the role of consent in marriage for intra-household allocation of resources and growth. We argue that a shift from parental to individual consent <b>moves</b> <b>resources</b> in the same direction, favouring young men and young women over old men. If young adults have greater incentives to invest in child human capital than the old (who will be around fewer periods), this may impact on growth. We formulate a simple endogenous growth model capturing these aspects. arranged marriage; endogenous growth; individual consent; love marriage; parental consent...|$|R

These must be collected {{in order to}} create zombies, the volume of each needed varies according to the type of zombie the player wishes to reanimate. Resources can be collected by clicking on any square which is horizontally or vertically connected to at least two more squares of the same type, without breaks in the chain. The player cannot <b>move</b> <b>resource</b> squares around the grid, only select which square to remove, along with any others if it forms part of a chain. The larger the number of resource squares in a chain, the more of that type of resource will be allocated to the player's reserves.|$|R

He commented, [...] "In a national campaign, what additional things are the headquarters really going to do to <b>move</b> <b>resources?</b> Will an additional auto-call last minute really make a difference in a market like Northeast Ohio, which has been saturated for three months full of auto-calls?" [...] Some pro-Democrat bloggers expressed concerns that the system would facilitate voter suppression but the ORCA training material emphasized that Romney volunteers should under no circumstances talk to or confront voters.|$|E
50|$|Freezing {{rain and}} sleet were {{recorded}} in coastal cities including Houston in southeast Texas, New Orleans in southeast Louisiana, Mobile in the Alabama panhandle, and Pensacola and Tallahassee in the Florida panhandle. Much of Interstate 10 was closed to east and west traffic, {{as well as others}} to and from inland areas. Bridges to barrier islands were also closed due to ice, and the almost total lack of deicing equipment and chemicals both for the Florida DOT and for local governments in all affected states, which had to rely entirely on sand spreaders retrofitted to dump trucks. Other states were able to <b>move</b> <b>resources</b> down from further up-state, however freeways and other state routes are generally the only roads which are treated by state governments.|$|E

The guaranteed effort requires a GBR bearer creation. This GBR bearer [12] setting is an expensive process that impacts both the network resources and end user’s (e.g. camera’s) battery power. So, such settings should be done only when it is required.|$|R

40|$|The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 is {{designed}} to help create a national minimum standard in the United States‘ public education system by requiring states to implement accountability systems. I examine the effect of No Child Left Behind on private school enrollment using a difference in differences model. Using data from the Private School Universe Survey, conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics, which is a survey conducted every two years and is mandatory for each American private school‘s administration to complete, I can evaluate the movement between public and private schools during the period when the requirements of No Child Left Behind were being implemented. I hypothesize that public schools have <b>moved</b> <b>resources</b> away from high achieving students toward the marginal students causing the high achieving students to enroll in private schools. Hence, private school enrollment will have increased due to No Child Left Behind. I find through my regressions that this hypothesis is true; the percentage of school-aged children in private schools increases after the signing of the No Child Left Behind Act...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, {{during the height}} of the Great Depression, many economists (most {{prominently}} John Maynard Keynes) tried to persuade governments that increased government spending would mitigate the situation and reduce unemployment. In the United Kingdom, the staff of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, notably Ralph George Hawtrey and Frederick Leith-Ross, argued against increased spending by putting forward the [...] "Treasury view". Simply put the Treasury view was the view that fiscal policy could only <b>move</b> <b>resources</b> from one use to another, and would not affect the total flow of economic activity. Therefore, neither government spending nor tax cuts could boost employment and economic activity. This view can historically be traced back to various statements of Say's law.|$|E

[...] According to reports, [...] "The governor Romney loves seeing data, he loves seeing numbers and he's a very strategic person; he's a very smart man. So he actually loves being inside these war rooms, seeing the data come in and seeing exactly what's going on out there, so we can all put our heads together and say, 'Okay, we need to <b>move</b> <b>resources</b> here. We need to shift resources from here.'" [...] The campaign's spokeswoman Andrea Saul told the Huffington Post that ORCA would provide Romney with [...] "an enormous advantage ...
