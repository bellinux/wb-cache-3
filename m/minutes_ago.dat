25|$|Yesterday I {{stood at}} Arlington National Cemetery {{attending}} {{the funeral of}} a young Marine in my district. He believed in {{what we were doing}} is the right thing and had the courage to lay his life on the line to do it. A few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> I received a call from Colonel Danny Bubp, Ohio Representative from the 88th district in the House of Representatives. He asked me to send Congress a message: Stay the course. He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do. Danny and the rest of America and the world want the assurance from this body—that we will see this through.|$|E
500|$|Del Toro {{acknowledged}} this message's simplicity, {{but said}} {{he would have liked to}} have seen adventure films with similar morals when he was a child. The film's ten primary characters all have [...] "little arcs" [...] conducive to this idea; del Toro stated: [...] "I think that's a great message to give kids… 'That guy you were beating the shit out of ten <b>minutes</b> <b>ago?</b> That's the guy you have to work with five minutes later.' That's life… We can only be complete when we work together." [...] The director noted that Hellboy and The Devil's Backbone told the same message, though the latter conveyed it in a very different way.|$|E
500|$|On February 15 {{the session}} began at 6p.m. but Dylan simply {{sat in the}} studio working on his lyrics while the musicians played cards, napped and chatted. Finally, at 4a.m., Dylan called the musicians in and {{outlined}} {{the structure of the}} song. Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in, as he attempted his epic composition [...] "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands". Kenny Buttrey recalled, [...] "If you notice that record, that thing after like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy, and everybody's just peaking it up 'cause we thought, Man, this is it... This is gonna be the last chorus and we've gotta put everything into it we can. And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel... After about ten minutes of this thing we're cracking up at each other, at what we were doing. I mean, we peaked five <b>minutes</b> <b>ago.</b> Where do we go from here?" [...] The finished song clocked in at 11 minutes, 23 seconds, and would occupy the entire fourth side of the album.|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of April 12, Norris didn't dare take the two ARVN {{soldiers}} who had faltered the night before. He was prepared to go alone when Petty Officer Third Class Nguyen Van Kiet volunteered to go with him. They worked their way slowly upriver until they came upon an abandoned, destroyed village. They found clothing and an abandoned sampan, which they used to disguise themselves as fishermen. They rowed quietly up river, {{but even in the}} pitch dark and dense fog they could see large numbers of North Vietnamese soldiers and tanks on the shoreline. Stopping to check his map at one point, Norris suddenly realized that two NVA soldiers were sitting about [...] away. Fortunately, they were asleep. Traveling upriver in the sampam, they broke out of the heavy fog and found themselves under the Cam Lo bridge. They had passed Hambleton’s position more than 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>ago.</b> Turning around, they worked their way south before putting ashore and began to search for Hambleton. They finally found him sitting in a clump of bushes, alive but partly delirious and extremely weakened, having eaten only four small ears of corn in 12 days and having lost [...] since his plane was shot down. He weighed only [...] Sunrise was coming, and although Norris thought it best to wait until dark to return downriver, Hambleton needed to be evacuated immediately. Despite the risk, they hid Hambleton {{in the bottom of the}} sampan, covered him with bamboo, and started downriver.|$|E
2500|$|Duma Foreign Affairs Committee member Vyacheslav Novikov said [...] "three <b>minutes</b> <b>ago,</b> Hillary Clinton {{acknowledged}} her {{defeat in}} the U.S. presidential elections and just a second ago, Trump began his speech as president-elect. I congratulate all of you on this." [...] The Duma then broke into applause.|$|E
2500|$|Graham {{often cited}} {{the fact that}} had 10 votes swung from the Conservatives to the Liberals in the riding of Kennebecasis {{there would have been}} a 27-27 tie which may have led to a Liberal {{minority}} government supported by the New Democrats whose one member would have held the balance of power. [...] Graham was quoted on election night saying [...] "until five <b>minutes</b> <b>ago,</b> I thought I was going to be premier".|$|E
