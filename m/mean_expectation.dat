This result was obtained based on the numerical solution of the kinetic equations describing nucleation and growth processes and the obtained in this way steady-state cluster size distributions. Here a straightforward alternative analytical interpretation of this result is proposed by computing directly the <b>mean</b> <b>expectation</b> times of formation of supercritical clusters. It is proven strictly that this result is generally independent of the kind of nucleation (homogeneous or heterogeneous) or specific realization (condensation, cavitation, crystallization, segregation, etc.) considered. It is shown that such behavior is simply a consequence of the linear dependence of the steady-state nucleation rate on the volume of the system, neither time-lag or primary depletion (due to the establishment of steady-state cluster size distributions for subcritical clusters) or secondary depletion (caused by the change {{of the state of the}} ambient phase due to the formation and growth of supercritical clusters and connected with finite size effects) are required for the interpretation of such result. In a second step, this analytical result is extended accounting for the growth of the supercritical cluster to directly measurable sizes. Finally, an analytical foundation of the method of determination of the critical supersaturation as employed by Kozisek is developed and the results obtained via the computation and analysis of steady-state cluster size distributions and calculation of <b>mean</b> <b>expectation</b> times for formation of the first supercritical clusters are compared.

The novelty of our approach is to combine two recent advances of the empirical literature on foreign exchange interventions: (i) drawing on over-the-counter option prices to characterize more precisely the distribution of market expectations; (ii) redefining interventions in terms of events as they tend to come in clusters. Moreover, in order to deal with the features of the data (small sample size, non-standard distribution), we use bootstrap tests. We show that interventions have a significant impact on the <b>mean</b> <b>expectation</b> (the forward rate). The results are more ambiguous for variance. Additionally, we find that the effect of interventions on skewness is significant, robust to different definitions of skewness, and consistent with the direction of interventions.

40|$|In Guadeloupe, Aedes aegypti {{mosquitoes}} are {{the only}} vectors of dengue and chikungunya viruses. For both diseases, vector control is the only tool for preventing epidemics since no vaccine or specific treatment is available. However, to efficiently implement control of mosquitoes vectors, a reliable estimation of the transmission risks is necessary. To become infective an Ae. aegypti female must ingest the virus during a blood meal {{and will not be}} able to transmit the virus during another blood-meal until the extrinsic incubation period is completed. Consequently the aged females will carry more infectious risks. The objectives of the present study were to estimate under controlled conditions the expectation of infective life for females and thus the transmission risks in relation with their reproductive cycle and parity status. Larvae of Ae. aegypti were collected in central Guadeloupe and breed under laboratory conditions until adult emergence. The experiments were performed at constant temperatures (± 1. 5 °C) of 24 °C, 27 °C and 30 °C on adults females from first generation (F 1). Females were kept and fed individually and records of blood-feeding, egg-laying and survival were done daily. Some females were dissected at different physiological stages to observe the ovaries development. The data were analyzed to follow the evolution of parity rates, the number of gonotrophic cycles, the fecundity and to study the <b>mean</b> <b>expectation</b> of life and the <b>mean</b> <b>expectation</b> of infective life for Ae. aegypti females according to temperatures. The expectation of life varies with the parity rates and according to the temperatures, with durations from about 10 days at low parity rates at the higher temperature to an optimal duration of about 35 days when 70 % of females are parous at 27 °C. Infective life expectancy was found highly variable in the lower parous rates and again the optimal durations were found when more than 50 % of females are parous for the mean temperatures of 27 °C and 30 °C. Parity rates can be determined for field collected females and could be a good proxy of the expectation of infective life according to temperatures. However, for the same parity rates, the estimation of infective life expectation is very different between Ae. aegypti and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. Correlation of field parity rates with transmission risks requires absolutely to be based on Ae. aegypti models, since available Anopheles sp. models underestimate greatly the females longevity...|$|E

To test Ferris ’ generalization, this study examines Chinese students ’ perceptions of GC in their English writing. The results of a questionnaire administered to six groups of three proficiency levels of university students majoring in or not in English show ambivalent perceptions towards GC. On the one hand, all learners believe GC has obvious effects and can improve their accuracy in L 2 writing. On the other hand, they all agree that GC is not enough for improving learners ’ writing ability and that the time spent on GC should be allocated on training other writing abilities. All groups of participants gave a negative to uncertain answer to GC, though different perception patterns figure in whether or not majoring in English: English-major groups ’ <b>mean</b> <b>expectation</b> scores of GC increase while those of non-English-major groups decrease in keeping with their English levels. These results provide strong evidence for Truscott’s (1996) view that GC should be abandoned.

The present study attempted to examine the role of service quality in measuring customer satisfaction in power sector of Bangladesh with reference to Dhaka Electric Supply Company (DESCO). Empirical in nature, the study focused {{on the distribution of}} electricity to the customers of DESCO. The survey took place in Dhaka since DESCO has its operation only in Dhaka division. Data were captured from 173 customers of DESCO under three zones (Mirpur, Gulshan, and Uttara) of Dhaka metropolitan city. Divided into three phases, the study first identified the customer expectation and perception of DESCO service quality and measured the gap between the two constructs. The second phase attempted to find out the level of customer satisfaction and investigated its relationship with DESCO’s perceived service quality. Finally, the third phase made an effort to suggest some measures to the management of DESCO to help the organization improve its service quality and the resulting satisfaction. The format of SERVQUAL instrument was used by modifying it to a 31 -item questionnaire for both expectation and perception sections to measure the gap in DESCO’s service quality and a 1 -item question was employed to measure the level of customer satisfaction with DESCO’s service quality. The study revealed that the overall mean perception of DESCO’s service quality was 3. 8137 and the overall <b>mean</b> <b>expectation</b> was 4. 4337 on a scale of 5. 00. The gap between perception and expectation was found to be - 0. 62. The data showed that, in general, the customers’ perception did not match their expectation.

This study aimed to assess human HIV/AIDS patients’ expectation of and satisfaction with the pharmaceutical service delivered at Gondar University Referral Hospital, Ethiopia. Patients and methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was performed from May 11 to 25, 2015. A total of 291 patients living with HIV/AIDS were included using a simple random sampling method. Data were collected using structured questionnaires measuring expectation and satisfaction of respondents using a Likert scale of 1 – 5 through face-to-face interviews. The data collected were entered into and analyzed using Statistical Packages for Social Sciences. Comparison was made between those respondents who lived in and outside the town. Results: The overall <b>mean</b> <b>expectation</b> and satisfaction of respondents toward pharmacy setting and services were 3. 62 and 3. 13, respectively.

40|$|INTRODUCTION. Aging [...] {{the effect}} of time [...] occurs in every living organism. Senescence is the last period of the lifespan, leading to death. It happens in all animals, with the {{exception}} of a few didermic species (Hydras) having a stock of embryonic cells and being immortal. The causes of animal senescence are badly known. They depend both on genetic characters (maximal lifespan of a species) and on medium factors (<b>mean</b> <b>expectation</b> of life of the animals of a species). Animal senescence could depend on cell aging: 1) by senescence and death of the differentiated cells, 2) by modified proliferation and differentiation of the stem cells of differentiated tissues, 3) by alterations in the extracellular matrices, 4) by interactions between factors 1) 2) and 3) in each tissue, 5) by interactions between the several tissues of an organism. This complexity badly impedes the experimental study of animal senescence. Normal mammal cells are aging when they are cultivated (in vitro ageing) : their phenotype varies and depends on the cell generation (in vitro differentiation); the last cell-generation doesn't divide anymore and declines until death of the culture (in vitro senescence). Analysis of these artificial but well controlled systems allows an experimental approach of the proliferation, differentiation, senescence and death of the cells and of the extracellular matrix functions. Present literature upon in vitro aging of cultivated human cells is essentially made of papers where proliferation and differentiation characteristics are compared between early ("young") and late ("old") cell-generations of the cultures. FIBROBLASTIC CELLS OF THE MOUSE SKIN. This cell type has been studied in our laboratory, using different systems: 1) Primary cultures isolated from peeled skins of 19 day old mouse embryos, 2) Mouse dermis analyzed in the animals, 3) Cultivated explants of skins, 4) Serial sub-cultures of fibroblasts isolated from these explants, 5) Cells cultivated comparably on plane substrates (glass, plastic, collagen films) and on tridimensional matrices (collagen fibres). Systems 2), 3), 4) and 5) have been obtained either from 19 day old embryos or from 6 groups of animals of different ages (from 1 / 2 till 25 month). In primary cultures (system 1) all the cell generations have been analyzed, including the last one until death of the culture. We have shown that many characters are varying with cell-generation: cell form and cell mass, rate of DNA replication and cell division, rate of RNA transcription, nature of the accumulated and of the synthetized proteins, organization of the cytoskeletal elements, organization of the extracellular matrix, type of cell death.

They depend both on genetic characters (maximum life span of a species) and on medium factors (<b>mean</b> <b>expectation</b> of life of the animals of a species). Animal senescence could depend on cell aging: (1) by senescence and death of the differentiated cells. (2) by modified proliferation of the stem cells of differentiated tissues, (3) by alterations in the extracellular matrices, (4) by interactions between factors (1) (2) and (3) in each tissue, and (5) by interactions between the several tissues of an organism. This complexity badly impedes the experimental study of animal senescence. Normal mammal cells are aging when they are cultivated (in vitro aging). Present literature upon in vitro aging of cultivated human fibroblasts consists essentially of papers devoted to proliferation and differentiation characteristics and not to cell senescence. Murine skin fibroblasts have been studied in our laboratory, using different systems: (1) primary cultures isolated from peeled skins of mouse embryos, (2) mouse derms analysed in the animals, (3) cultivated explants of skins, (4) serial sub-cultures of fibroblasts isolated from these explants, (5) cells cultivated comparably on plane substrates (glass, plastic, collagen films) and on three-dimensional matrices (collagen fibres). In primary cultures (system 1) all the cell generations have been analysed, including the last one until death of the culture. We have shown that many characters are varying with cell generation. All the observed variations were: progressive, non-linear and correlated (intracellular feedbacks). We come to the conclusion that the main effects of cell mitotic age are (1) to depress the plasticity of the chromatin, (2) to change the organization of the cytoplasmic filaments, (3) to change the organization of the extracellular matrix. The collagen fibres are also acting upon nucleus and filaments either in the animals or in the cultures. The phenotype of a fibroblastic cell is thus both age- and environment-dependent. Overall data on in vitro cell aging point to the hypothesis that senescent cells are phenotypic variants and not mutant cells. Aging cell cultures are remarkably useful to the studies on cell proliferation decrease and cell cycle lengthening shown by the stem cells in animal tissues. We propose the hypothesis that the fibroblasts of the vertebrates would be homologous to the pluripotent mesenchyme cells of their embryos. © 1988. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Aging {{societies}} have {{given rise to}} important challenges in the field of health insurance. Elderly policyholders need to be provided with fair premiums based on their individual health status, whereas insurance companies want to plan for the potential costs of tackling lifetimes above <b>mean</b> <b>expectations.</b> In this article, we focus on a large cohort of policyholders in Barcelona (Spain), aged 65 years and over. A shared-parameter joint model is proposed to analyse the relationship between annual demand for emergency claims and time until death outcomes, which are subject to left truncation. We compare different functional forms of the association between both processes, and, furthermore, we illustrate how the fitted model provides time-dynamic predictions of survival probabilities. The parameter estimation is performed under the Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods...|$|R

A natural carbon cycle converts the sun’s energy and atmospheric carbon into organic matter through plants and algae, and stores it in the earth’s crust and oceans. Stabilisation of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere requires the rate of greenhouse gas emissions to fall to the rate of natural sequestration. There are many uncertainties around the <b>mean</b> <b>expectations</b> from the science, with the possibility of outcomes that are either more benign— or catastrophic.
