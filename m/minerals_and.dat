40|$|In this paper, an {{input-output}} framework {{is used for}} measuring thesignificance of domestic levels of <b>mineral</b> <b>and</b> energy sectors for variouseconomies {{at different stages of}} economic development. The aim is to determinethe significance of industry interconnectedness between each <b>mineral</b> <b>and</b> energysector {{and the rest of the}} economy. The rationale is that development plannersprefer sectors with extensive inter-industry ties to enclave sectors or sectorswith a few industry connections. It has been argued that the mineral sector isnothing but an enclave sector. Following a brief evaluation of the literatureconcerning the importance of mining and energy-related activities for economicdevelopment, an empirical analysis was performed employing a static inputoutputframework to measure <b>mineral</b> <b>and</b> energy sector impacts. The focus ison quantifiable linkages between the <b>mineral</b> <b>and</b> energy sectors and the rest ofthe economy. Direct, indirect and induced impacts are felt through macroeconomicmeasures such as gross national income and output. Both multipliersand linkages which capture these effects are derived. The results presentedhere emphasise the significant role of the <b>mineral</b> <b>and</b> energy sectors in economicdevelopment. <b>Mineral</b> <b>and</b> energy sectors are able to generate great industryinter-linkages and high output. Nonetheless, the opportunities for generatinggrowth prospects seem to vary with the type of <b>mineral</b> <b>and</b> energy activityundertaken as well as with the level of economic development achieved by thecountry. ...|$|R

5|$|Four {{hundred million}} years ago, California lay {{at the bottom of}} a large sea; {{underwater}} volcanoes deposited lava and minerals (including gold) onto the sea floor. By tectonic forces these <b>minerals</b> <b>and</b> rocks came to the surface of the Sierra Nevada, and eroded. Water carried the exposed gold downstream and deposited it in quiet gravel beds along the sides of old rivers and streams. The forty-niners first focused their efforts on these deposits of gold.|$|E

Lepidolite contains between 0.3% and 3.5% rubidium, and is the commercial source of the element. Some potassium <b>minerals</b> <b>and</b> potassium chlorides also contain the element in commercially significant quantities.|$|E

To maintain a claim, the owner must work 1,500 man-hours per five years and pay an annual fee of 6,000 Norwegian krone.

5|$|A {{visit to}} Cornwall in 1746–1747, {{where he met}} the antiquary and naturalist William Borlase, awakened an {{interest}} in <b>minerals</b> <b>and</b> fossils which formed his main scientific study during the 1750s.

More practically, Pennant used his geological knowledge to open a lead mine, which helped to finance improvements at Downing after he had inherited the estate in 1763.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{butterflies}} consume only liquids, ingested {{through the}} proboscis.

Some butterflies also visit dung, rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain <b>minerals</b> <b>and</b> nutrients.
