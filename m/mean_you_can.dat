500|$|The {{presence}} of the RLI's two conflicting reputations—excellent in the field, but appalling at home—is evident from the line of reporting taken by The Rhodesia Herald on 25 July 1975. Alongside the front-page article announcing the award and the day's parade through Salisbury, there prominently appears a cartoon satirising the RLI's off-duty antics. Two RLI officers in dress uniform are portrayed in a Salisbury street, both turning angrily to see a uniformed RLI trooper chasing a crowd of terrified, screaming young women across the road. One of the officers barks his disapproval, which is spelt out in the caption underneath: [...] "Freedom of the City doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do that, Van Schalkwyk!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Historically in the West, the {{technique}} {{is known to have}} been used in the Spanish Inquisition. The suffocation of bound prisoners with water has been favored because, unlike most other torture techniques, it produces no marks on the body. CIA officers who have subjected themselves to {{the technique}} have lasted an average of 14seconds before capitulating. According to at least one former CIA official, information retrieved from the waterboarding may not be reliable because a person under such duress may admit to anything, as harsh interrogation techniques lead to false confessions. [...] "The person believes they are being killed, and as such, it really amounts to a mock execution, which is illegal under international law", says John Sifton of Human Rights Watch. It is [...] "bad interrogation. I <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get anyone to confess to anything if the torture's bad enough", said former CIA officer Bob Baer. There was considerable dissension within the Bush administration over the use of these techniques; both military investigators and the FBI opposed them.|$|E

On October 14, 2011, Justin Richmond, confirmed that it won't be releasing any downloadable content for Uncharted 3: Drake's Deceptions single-player mode. [...] "There's a very specific reason," [...] said Richmond. [...] "Whenever we sit down and think we should do some single-player DLC, someone pitches something and we realize – that's a five hour level." [...] "Dialling back our ambition is difficult," [...] added Arne Meyer, Naughty Dog's Community Strategist. [...] "We'd rather build out another game than we would do episodic content," [...] continued Richmond. [...] "We're so small that we can't afford to have a whole team working on DLC." ...|$|E

[...] A man who can do that has got to have a pretty fair amount of savoir what do you call it, and he's got to be mighty well shaved and have his cameo pin put in his tie at a pretty undeniable angle before he can tackle it. Yes, and even then he may need to hang round behind the lilac bushes for half an hour first, and cool off. And he's apt to make pretty good time down Oneida Street on the way back.|$|E
