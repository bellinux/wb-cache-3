40|$|Motion in Pain and Pleasure” is {{a thesis}} work that explores the {{relationship}} between what is pain and what is pleasure, and how an understanding and cooperation of both may yield growth. As a Bachelor of Fine Arts Candidate in Dance, at the University of Colorado, Boulder, I produced and choreographed a dance work entitled “Petit Naissance. ” Through this work, I investigated the binary of pain and pleasure, explored their function in {{the physical and emotional}} sense, and deconstructed previously understood notions about them. <b>My</b> <b>investigation</b> focused more <b>specifically</b> on pain and finding ways to turn pain into growth, pain into goodness, and pain into pleasure...|$|R
40|$|In <b>my</b> <b>investigation</b> I {{concentrate}} <b>specifically</b> on {{cases of}} children from three childrens homes in Italy and Czech republic (Casa del bambino PIO XII., private childrens home Marketa and Church childrens home Emanuel). In these homes they use preventative bahaviour system founded by Don Giovanni Bosco who was the Italian priest and educator {{who lived in the}} 19 century and he founded the work which was dedicated to the poor young people without their home in Turin. The intention of Don Giovanni Bosco was to help to give the right direction to young people. This system has three basic pillars which are reason, kidness and religion. His system demands from the educator constant presence with the children and education with the example of yourself. The preventative behaviour system of Salesiani and its tradition is worth attention for the the prevention of social [...] pathological phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} evolving democratization of tattooing and the shifting significance of tattoos {{in an analysis}} from the 1950 s to the current era. Unlike previous scholarship, this study also links the democratization of tattoos to the continuous struggle over the body against state institutions [...] not just limiting it to the 1960 s counter-culture. Often absent in other studies concerning the popularization and eventual commodification of tattoos is the "hip-hop element"; I argue that marking the skin was a logical extension of drawing attention to an "invisible generation" experiencing economic neglect and the impact from the "War on Drugs," "War on Gangs," and "War on Youths" in the 1980 s. Rapper Tupac Shakur contributed to the growth and contraction of marking the body, and this is symptomatic of the discursive dialectic between the tolerance for and the backlash against civil rights in recent America history. The context of <b>my</b> <b>investigation</b> is <b>specifically</b> American, as I argue that decades of tattooing practices have rendered tattoos peculiarly evocative signifiers of diverse American identities. After the 1950 s, marking the skin {{became part of the}} discourse over civil liberties regarding the body. My study centers on women, gays and lesbians, blacks, the military, and entertainers or professional athletes. Individuals within these groups have been among the most ardent practitioners of tattooing and among the most visible recipients of tattoos; not coincidentally, these groups have also been among the most marginalized or celebrated of Americans, often voluntarily distancing themselves from the larger American society through their commercialized tattoos and their defiantly political uses of their bodies. The primary thrust of this discussion is to identify how various groups have used tattooing to assert their self-determination or civic identities publicly, and to define themselves by writing on their bodies...|$|R
40|$|My {{research}} {{deals with}} fantasy and the fantastic as genres, {{as well as}} with their subgenres. I propose a new genology for fantasy and fantastic literature and their subgenres in which {{they are part of a}} continuum, with fantasy standing on one end and mimetic literature standing on the other, the fantastic being their middle ground. Within this continuum, the subgenres – which I call fantasy marvel-fiction and fantastic marvel-fiction, fantasy science-fiction and fantastic science-fiction, fantasy surrealism and fantastic surrealism – are distinguished among themselves according to two axes, namely: a) the inner coherence or incoherence of the world the text presents – their being subjected or not to the laws of that world –; b) the nature, and the appropriate explanation – marvelous or scientific –, of the phenomenon that breaks the natural laws of the reader’s known real world. This relationship between reality and fantasy has been essential to <b>my</b> <b>investigation.</b> More <b>specifically,</b> what I have named “the scientific urban gaze” of reality has been the touch-stone to establish what is fantasy and what is not and to create the consequent genology. The genology I propose must therefore be pragmatic: the reader’s view of reality must be taken into account in the process of placing a text within this continuum and the proper genre and subgenre. Once the genology is fully explained, I compare it to the work of some of the most prominent critics on the field of fantasy and the fantastic in order to see similitudes and differences between their research and mine. For the validity of my genology to be demonstrated, I apply it in the analysis of some Mexican narrative works and show how the genre and subgenre of a text – in interaction with the text’s archetypes and narrative components – can be an effective means to convey ideology or worldview. The genological approach, therefore, integrated with an archetypal and a narratological one, constitutes an efficient tool for a holistic semiotic analysis. Notwithstanding that in my thesis I apply it to literary works, it can also be applied to cinema and theatre...|$|R
