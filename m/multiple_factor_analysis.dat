40|$|Aims and objectives: (1) To {{explore the}} effect of {{continued}} nursing intervention on hypertensive patients based on chronotherapeutics. (2) To identify the factors affecting hypertensive patients' compliance to the chronotherapeutics-oriented nursing interventions. Background: Chronotherapy provides a means of individual treatment for hypertension according to the circadian blood-pressure profile of each patient and constitutes a new option in optimising blood-pressure control and reducing risk from hypertension. Design: Experimental study. Methods: All participants enrolled were randomly divided into the intervention group and the control group and they all took antihypertensive medicine prescribed by their doctors under ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. According to individual ambulatory blood pressure monitoring measures, interventions were implemented. Results: (1) There were significant differences in blood pressure and compliance to chronotherapeutics {{between the two groups}} before and after the intervention. (2) Single variant and <b>multiple</b> <b>factors</b> <b>analysis</b> revealed different characteristics influencing chronotherapeutic compliance of hypertensive patients. Conclusions: Under ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, continued nursing intervention for hypertensive patients guided by chronotherapeutics could effectively improve blood-pressure control and chronotherapeutic compliance.

According to different influencing factors on patients' chronotherapeutic compliance nurses should pay more attention to those whose compliance might be worse. School of Nursin...|$|R

The implants used in this study were two kinds of diameters (3.8  mm, 5.0  mm) and two kinds of lengths (7.0  mm, 12.0  mm) having a general threadlike shape with a mechanically polished surface. To measure the bone density and the cortical thickness around the implants accurately, the CBCT scanning was performed immediately just after the formation of the implant cavity. The initial stabilities were evaluated by the ITVs and the ISQ values. The bone density and cortical thickness around the implants were measured by an implant simulation software (Landmarker ver. 5.0 with special specifications for this study). The relationships of the thickness of the cortical bone and the voxel values with the ITVs and the ISQ values were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient.
