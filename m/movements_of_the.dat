5|$|Computed tomography, {{also known}} as CT scanning, of a {{complete}} Majungasaurus skull (FMNH PR 2100) allowed a rough reconstruction of its brain and inner ear structure. Overall, the brain was very small relative to body size, but otherwise similar to many other non-coelurosaurian theropods, with a very conservative form closer to modern crocodilians than to birds. One difference between Majungasaurus and other theropods was its smaller flocculus, a region of the cerebellum that helps to coordinate <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye with <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head. This suggests that Majungasaurus and other abelisaurids like Indosaurus, which also had a small flocculus, did not rely on quick head movements to sight and capture prey.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the early}} 1900s, {{grassroots}} movements have been widespread {{both in the}} United States and in other countries. Major examples include parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Civil Rights <b>Movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1950s and 1960s, Brazil's land equity <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970s and beyond, the Chinese rural democracy <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, and <b>the</b> German peace <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980s.|$|R

50|$|Windmills, a {{variation}} on the broken cross (swastika) motif, are actually sun symbols, not agricultural symbols. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross echoes <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun across the sky.|$|R
5|$|For {{the opening}} {{sequence}} involving tribes of apes, professional mime Daniel Richter {{in addition to}} playing the lead ape was also responsible for choreographing the <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other man-apes, who were mostly portrayed by his standing mime troupe.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{researchers}} {{announced the}} discovery of a series of Maya astronomical tables in Xultún, Guatemala which plot the <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon and other astronomical bodies over the course of 17 b'ak'tuns.|$|E
5|$|Olivier Messiaen {{often used}} birdsong as an {{inspiration}} for his music, and the yellowhammer features in Chronochromie, Catalogue d'oiseaux, La fauvette des jardins and Méditations sur le mystère de la Sainte Trinité, appearing in four <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last piece.|$|E
50|$|The uterus {{contains}} three suspensory ligaments {{that help}} stabilize <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uterus and limits its range <b>of</b> <b>movement.</b> <b>The</b> uterosacral ligaments keep {{the body from}} moving inferiorly and anteriorly. The round ligaments restrict posterior <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uterus. The cardinal ligaments also prevent <b>the</b> inferior <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uterus.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} be able to do this the baby needs to have been {{successful}} in unlinking <b>the</b> automatic <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head from <b>the</b> automatic <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arms and legs.|$|R
50|$|National Labor Union {{represented}} the transition between the democratic, egalitarian, conscious, humanitarian, and reformist labor <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antebellum period, and the self-centered, wage-conscious, trade-unionist labor <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late nineteenth century.|$|R
5|$|Red fox body {{language}} consists of <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ears, tail and postures, with their body markings emphasising certain gestures. Postures {{can be divided}} into aggressive/dominant and fearful/submissive categories. Some postures may blend the two together.|$|E

5|$|Angular motions (or rotary motions) {{occur when}} an object is around another object {{increasing}} or decreasing the angle. The {{different parts of}} the object do not move the same distance. Examples include a movement of the knee, where the lower leg changes angle compared to the femur, or <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ankle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most basic}} form asks the {{offensive}} linemen to identify {{whether he is}} covered or uncovered. If uncovered, he is asked to help play-side on a double team by using wide lateral steps or even bucket steps. The resulting double team then reacts to <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linemen as well as <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linebacker. <b>The</b> initial <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> double teams helps to equalize defensive talent and creates cutback lanes.|$|R
30|$|Regarding {{the second}} molar, the LP HG {{contracted}} <b>the</b> distal surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crown and facilitated limited <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tooth crown and roots. The HP HG expanded the mesiobuccal and lingual crown surfaces and elicited limited <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tooth crown and roots. The CP HG expanded the mesiobuccal crown surface and elicited limited <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tooth crown and roots.|$|R
25|$|The proximity, {{shape and}} <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piston {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valve itself {{significantly}} alters the flow conditions in a real engine that do not exist in flow bench tests.|$|R
5|$|As these laudes {{were to be}} {{performed}} with a very limited accompaniment of instruments, they were supposedly performed from the small loft in the high choir of the Thomaskirche, opposite to the large organ loft where the other <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Magnificat were performed. The autograph of the E-flat major version of the Magnificat (BWV 243a) suggests that Bach intended to perform {{the first version of}} his Magnificat also without the laudes, depending on circumstances, for example on other feasts than Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's public {{popularity}} as a virtuoso {{began to}} wane, {{as did the}} number of his pupils, and this, together with the political strife and instability of the time, caused him to struggle financially. In February 1848, with the cellist Auguste Franchomme, he gave his last Paris concert, which included three <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cello Sonata Op. 65.|$|E
5|$|In 1836, Stone {{began reading}} {{newspaper}} {{reports of a}} controversy raging throughout Massachusetts that some {{referred to as the}} “woman question” – what was woman’s proper role in society; should she assume an active and public role in the reform <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day? Developments within that controversy {{over the next several years}} shaped her evolving philosophy on women’s rights.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Chartist <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1830s and 1840s was {{the first}} mass revolutionary <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British working-class. Mass {{meetings}} and demonstrations involving millions of proletariat and petty-bourgeois were held throughout the country for years.|$|R
50|$|Eversion is <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot {{away from}} the median plane.Inversion is <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sole towards the median plane. For example, {{inversion}} describes the motion when an ankle is twisted.|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} {{positioning}} an object about a remote center of rotation. A non-movable part provides a stationary reference structure. A movable part moves {{relative to the}} non-movable part. A connector coupled between the movable part and the object positions the object adjacent <b>the</b> remote center <b>of</b> rotation and rotates it about <b>the</b> remote center <b>of</b> rotation responsive to <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movable part. <b>Movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> connector responds <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movable part. First and second force transmitting components coupled to the movable part move the movable part and the connector in first and second directions, respectively. <b>Movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> connector in the first direction rotates the object about a first axis passing through <b>the</b> remote center <b>of</b> rotation. <b>Movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> connector in the second direction rotates the object about a second axis passing through <b>the</b> remote center <b>of</b> rotation...|$|R
5|$|In Red Dead Redemption, players mainly control former outlaw John Marston as he {{sets out}} to bring his former gang to justice. The team used motion capture to record the body <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{characters}} and hired professional actors to provide voices. Red Dead Redemption features an original score composed over fifteen months by two music producers. Collaboratively, the duo composed over fourteen hours of music, which scores the game's missions.|$|E
5|$|Marquee Moon was {{released}} to widespread critical acclaim and unexpected commercial {{success in the}} United Kingdom, but sold poorly in the United States. The record has since been viewed by critics {{as one of the}} greatest albums of all time and a foundational record of alternative rock. Television's innovative post-punk instrumentation on Marquee Moon strongly influenced the new wave and indie rock <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The Thalassocalycida, only {{discovered}} in 1978 and known from only one species, are medusa-like, with bodies that are shortened in the oral-aboral direction, and short comb-rows {{on the surface}} furthest from the mouth, originating from near the aboral pole. They capture prey by <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bell and possibly by using two short tentacles.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Chartist <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1830s and 1840s was {{the first}} mass revolutionary <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British working class.

50|$|It is {{proposed}} that the line from Grímsvötn volcano to Surtsey shows <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eurasian Plate, and the line from Grímsvötn volcano to Snæfellsnes volcanic belt shows <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North American Plate.|$|R
50|$|Tarzi {{effectively}} guided <b>the</b> second <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young constitutionalists called Mashroota Khwah. This led to reviving <b>the</b> first suppressed <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constitutionalists in Afghanistan. Tarzi {{served as}} high counsel and advisor during this event.|$|R
5|$|The finale is in sonata form. It {{features}} significant {{developments of}} a simple motif, and considerable dialogue between the four parts. The finale also contains {{a high degree of}} chromaticism, a feature that links the four <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work. The musicologist W. Dean Sutcliffe points to the recurrence of C at key points in each movement, serving at different times to create dissonance, to commence modulation (music) away from the tonic, or, {{as in the case of}} the finale, as a device for inflection.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the {{colonization}} of the world's continents by rodents is complex. The <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large superfamily Muroidea (including hamsters, gerbils, true mice and rats) may have involved up to seven colonizations of Africa, five of North America, four of Southeast Asia, two of South America and up to ten of Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|The mantis thorax {{consists}} of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer {{than the other two}} thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing {{for a wide range of}} <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Animation {{showing the}} {{relationship}} between TDOA and FDOA lines with respect to satellite motion over a 24-hour period.

30|$|Significant {{and greater}} change in molar {{relationship}} {{was found in}} the tooth-borne group (2.7  mm) compared to the bone-anchored group (1.1  mm, p[*]<[*]. 05). This was contributed by similar forward <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxilla and backward <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandible in both groups, but greater differential <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxillary and mandibular molars {{was found in the}} tooth-borne protraction facemask group. <b>The</b> mean forward <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> maxillary molars was similar for the tooth-borne (0.6  mm) and bone-anchored protraction facemask groups (0.5  mm).|$|R
50|$|Movements {{in art and}} philosophy, such as <b>the</b> Humanist <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Renaissance and <b>the</b> Scholastic <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Middle Ages, were {{motivated}} by a drive to connect Catholicism with Greek thought imported by Christian pilgrims.|$|R
