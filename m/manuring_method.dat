No effect on total numbers of Enchytraeidae and nematodes was found. Enrichment opportunistic nematodes (CP 1) significantly decreased in the MB treatment, resulting in a significantly higher Maturity Index. In the SMI treatment the Maturity Index was unchanged.

Under wet conditions abundance of earthworms, especially epigeic earthworms, decreased significantly in the MB treatment. In the summer of 2003 total earthworm numbers, and the fraction of epigeics, decreased after SMI.

40|$|Two {{projects}} were completed to provide significant new {{information to the}} agricultural industry regarding the environmental implications and soil health impacts related to land application of swine manure. The first study reports on the runoff transport of nutrients and microbials as affected by <b>manure</b> application <b>method</b> and time following application. The second study provides information {{about the effect of}} application method and time following application on soil health indicators using arthropod abundance and diversity as a biological indicator. The information gained through these studies will provide beneficial information to the pork industry on the impact of <b>manure</b> application <b>method</b> and the timing of application on limiting the movement of manure constituents with runoff while improving soil biological health. The first field study was conducted to measure the effects of <b>manure</b> application <b>method</b> and time following application on runoff transport of nutrients and microbials. Swine slurry was applied to the soil by a commercial applicator in June 2014 using broadcast and injection methods. Simulated rainfall events were applied to the study plots following manure application in June, July, and August 2014. The broadcast treatment resulted in significantly greater dissolved and total phosphorous runoff loads than the injection treatment. Soil erosion was greater for the injection plots than for the broadcast treatment sites. Overland flow rate variation {{had a significant impact on}} all measured water quality parameters. Significant reductions in nutrient transport loads were observed on plots where slurry was injected rather than broadcast. Nutrient and microbial transport loads decreased significantly during the 45 days following slurry application for both treatments. The second study was conducted to determine the impact of <b>manure</b> application <b>method</b> and time following application on soil health by examining the chemical and biological responses to the treatments over time. Swine slurry for this study was also applied to field plots in June 2014 by a commercial applicator using broadcast and injection methods. The broadcast treatment resulted in a significant increase in hypogastruridae and isotomidae populations over time. For the broadcast treatment, significant initial increases in nutrient content were observed, while the injection treatment showed very little initial response with much greater increases later in the study. Time following slurry application had a significant impact on all measured soil characteristics and all but one of the arthropod Orders that were quantified.

40|$|Declining {{per capita}} food {{production}} and soil fertility depletion are threatening the livelihoods of many small-holder farmers in East Africa, including Uganda. High demand for food {{due to the}} increase in population has necessitated the need to improve crop yields where synthetically manufactured fertiliser use in the production system is often scarce and expensive. Cattle manure provides essential plant nutrients (mainly nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium) and is available locally; however, there is little information in Uganda on soil fertility status, the most effective rates of cattle <b>manure,</b> <b>methods</b> of application, crop requirements for specific nutrients and limiting factors to crop production. A survey was conducted on selected small-holder farmers in Uganda, in the central districts (Kampala and Wakiso) in January 2010 to identify socio-economic factors influencing the use of fertiliser and the current level of soil fertility as constraints that were most limiting to plant production. It was apparent from the survey and soil sampling that soil physicochemical values varied greatly amongst the soils and sites investigated. Unfortunately, in many situations the application of fertilisers being used didn’t target specific nutrients most limiting to crop production.

The results revealed that in raw swine manure, Dialister pneumosintes, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Succinivibrioan dextrinosolvens, and Schineria sp. were detected. ATAD exhibited more efficiency to eliminate of these pathogens than ALT. In the mesophilic ALF-treated swine manure, Schineria sp. and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were still detected, while were undetected in ATAD. These findings support the superiority of ATAD in selectively reducing potential human and animal pathogens compared to ALF, which is a typical <b>manure</b> stabilization <b>method</b> used in livestock farms. In a comparison between aerobic and anaerobic treatment of biosolids, it can be indicated that the anaerobic process is more efficient than the aerobic process, but the limitations to apply the anaerobic treatment lie {{in the design and}} the maintenance in the developing countries.|$|R

The Rule notes that the CWA specifically exempts agricultural storm water runoff from being considered a point source, but, based on the Court of Appeals' decision in the Waterkeeper case, the EPA may treat land applications of excessive amounts of manure as a point source. So while in general agricultural storm water runoff from CAFOs is a nonpoint source, CAFOs may end up requiring a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit under the CWA.|$|R

Converting the operation from daily haul to 6 mo of storage with broadcast application did not substantially change nitrogen (N) losses to the environment. However, switching to manure injection conserved ammonium N and improved manure N use efficiency by crops, even though it increased N leaching by 27 % with 6 -mo storage and 13 % with 12 -mo storage. Increasing manure storage from 6 to 12 mo with manure injection reduced nitrate N leaching by 38 %, due to better timing of manure application to crop growth, but lowered annual net returns.

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} {{is considered one}} of the world’s most pressing public health issues. One source of antimicrobials in the environment is animal agriculture. Antimicrobials are used for growth promotion, prophylaxis, and for disease treatment within concentrated animal feed operations (CAFOs). Antimicrobials may allow resistant bacteria to proliferate in manure applied as fertilizer, and therefore antimicrobials and antimicrobial resistant genes (ARGs) may contaminate surface and ground water. The fate and transport of antimicrobials, ARGs in soil and surface runoff is quantified in this study after land applications of surface applied and injected swine manure. Rainfall simulations were conducted after manure containing chlortetracycline, bacitracin, or tylosin was applied by broadcast, incorporation, or injection methods. Soil and runoff samples were collected and analyzed for antimicrobials in the liquid phase through high pressure liquid chromatograph or liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. Published qPCR protocols were followed to determine the concentration of ARGs in manure, soil, and runoff for tetQ, tetX, ermB, and ermF. Significant vertical transport of ARGs was not detected in the soil samples. Antimicrobials and ARGs decreased in runoff throughout the three day experiment.

The marginal rate of return on manure use was increased significantly by composting manure in pits. Financial benefits obtained from pit- stored manure were much higher {{in the first year of}} manure application compared to those of heap- stored manure. Higher returns from heap- stored manure were obtained in the second and third season after manure application. Overall undiscounted financial benefits for the three years were marginally higher for heap- stored manure. Using a discount rate of 100 % financial benefits from using pit-stored manure were much higher than those of heap stored manure as pit-stored manure provided much higher returns in the first year of application. Higher financial benefits were obtained from supplementing manure with inorganic fertiliser compared to using manure alone. Banding and placing manure on-station (applying the manure to the hill of maize) increased returns from using both pit and heap stored manure. The conventional practice of broadcasting manure was found not to be profitable. Production Economics, Productivity Analysis, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

Best fertilization practices include applying the correct fertilizer at the correct rate, time and place. In this regard, manure placement effects on growth, root system development and nutrient uptake of a plantain hybrid were evaluated in a screen-house. Three <b>manure</b> placement <b>methods,</b> whereby the full dose of manure was applied as top-dressing (T 1), bottom-dressing (T 2), or a split combination thereof (T 3), were assessed together with a no manure control (T 4). There was significant (P < 0. 05) treatment effects {{on most of the}} parameters studied. T 1 gave the best growth indices 3 months after transplanting (MAT) but not at 5 MAT. The highest root NPK and leaf N at 3 MAT was associated with T 3. T 3 also induced the best plant growth at 5 MAT, followed by T 2. Expectedly, the control treatment produced plants with the poorest growth. Whole-plant biomass yield and distribution were influenced by manure placement as was specific leaf area. Significantly large correlations between leaf- 3 parameters and whole-plant growth indices were observed. Thus, dry weight of leaf- 3 predicted whole-plant biomass yield with high reliability (r 2 = 94. 1 %), supporting leaf- 3 analysis as a non-destructive alternative for assessment of plant performance in response to manure. It was apparent from the study that plant performance indices at 3 and 5 MAT showed that split dressing at the top and the bottom of the pots (T 3) was a more sustainable <b>method</b> for <b>manure</b> application to Musa.

40|$|Phosphate release {{kinetics}} from manures are of global interest because sustainable plant nutrition with phosphate {{will be a}} major concern in the future. Although information on the bioavailability and chemical composition of P present in manure used as fertilizer are important to understand its dynamics in the soil, such studies are still scarce. Therefore, P extraction was evaluated in this study by sequential chemical fractionation, desorption with anion-cation exchange resin and 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance (31 P-NMR) spectroscopy to assess the P forms in three different dry manure types (i. e. poultry, cattle and swine <b>manure).</b> All three <b>methods</b> showed that the P forms in poultry, cattle and swine dry manures are mostly inorganic and highly bioavailable. The estimated P pools showed that organic and recalcitrant P forms were negligible and highly dependent on the Ca:P ratio in manures. The results obtained here showed that the extraction of P with these three different methods allows a better understanding and complete characterization of the P pools present in the manures...|$|R
40|$|Green {{manuring}} puts humus {{into the}} soil {{and that makes it}} an important farm practice, because humus is absolutely essential for the best growth of crops. Humus may be added in another way, by applying barnyard <b>manure,</b> but that <b>method</b> alone will not keep the soil from losing fertility from year to year. Even though it is saved with the utmost care, the manure produced on the farm will not return to the soil all the fertility removed by the crops. Circular No. 9, 2 ̆ 2 Farm Manures, 2 ̆ 2 Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station, shows furthermore, that there are certain unavoidable losses in the storing of manure and that they may involve not only the valuable mineral constituents, but also the organic matter. As agriculture is now generally practiced in Iowa and elsewhere, the soil is being gradually worn out. It is clear, therefore, that some other means must be employed to keep up the humus content of soils and this may be accomplished by turning under green manure crops...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePlant {{fertilization}} is a {{major issue}} in the context of increasing population and food risk, higher cost of fertilizers, and low target efficiency of traditional mineral fertilization practices. Alternatively, application of microbial inoculants to the soil can enhance the uptake of nutrients by plants and increase the efficiency of mineral fertilizers and <b>manures.</b> Encapsulation <b>methods</b> involve covering and protecting the microorganisms. Encapsulation of bacterial cells has been challenged and used mainly in the agricultural industry using processes, such as spray drying, interfacial polymerization, or cross-linking. Here, we review techniques for microbial inoculants and their benefits for sustainable agriculture. Techniques include fluidized bed, extrusion, molecular inclusion, coacervation, liposomes, ionic or inverse gelation, and oil-entrapped emulsion. Major topics discussed are formulation of microbial inoculants, conventional inoculants, bioencapsulation materials, bioencapsulation techniques, and future trends. We found that (1) conventional inoculant does not provide adequate protection for microorganisms. (2) Bioencapsulation improves the protection and controlled release of bacteria. (3) Sodium alginate {{is one of the most}} used products for the bioencapsulation of microorganisms. (4) The bioencapsulation of microbial inoculants is performed with the incorporation of an active ingredient into a matrix followed by a mechanical operation, and finally stabilization by a chemical or physical–chemical process. (5) Spray-drying process works on a continuous basis, low operating cost, and high quality of capsules in good yield, although the high temperature used in the process is not very appropriate for encapsulating non-spore-forming bacteria. 6) Fluid-bed process is a promising encapsulation technique for large-scale production in agricultural industry. (7) Ionic gelation is currently the most adequate method found to encapsulate bacteria. (8) Some advantages and drawbacks are found for each technique; therefore, the selection of suitable bioencapsulation method will depend on bacteria strain, cost, processing conditions, and handling...|$|R
