5|$|It {{has been}} a {{struggle}} telling this story over the years, {{because a lot of}} people don't want to hear about this kind of history. People don't relate to it, or just don't want to hear about it. But Mama told <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it alive, so I keep telling it... It's a sad story, but it's one I think everyone needs to hear.|$|E
500|$|The author {{explained}} to Los Angeles Magazine her reasoning for {{including in the}} book a graphic phrase used by Jack Nicholson after his lovemaking session with her: [...] "The reason that line made the book is because he {{told me not to}} say anything. And I will never, ever respond to anybody—man, woman, vegetable, or mineral—who tells <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my mouth shut. Alter what I've been through, I don't think so, pal." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{his victory}} Maguire {{acknowledged}} {{the influence of}} Terry Griffiths {{who had been working}} with him on the mental side of the game: [...] "He's been on the phone just telling <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> calm and that I can do it if I believe in myself". Maguire said he always knew he was good enough to win a tournament and that he would aim for a top-16 finish for the season. White said, [...] "Stephen outplayed me in safety, potting and position so he deserved to win" [...] and, [...] "He gave me a good bashing. I'm pleased for him because he's a nice lad but I'm disappointed because I didn't compete".|$|E

500|$|The direct {{impetus for}} the lyrics was an {{encounter}} with IRA supporters in New York City. As a promotional gimmick, U2 manager Paul McGuinness had made arrangements for the band {{to appear in the}} 1982 St. Patrick's Day parade. However, he later found that there was a possibility that Bobby Sands, an IRA hunger striker who had starved to death the previous year, would be the parade's honorary marshal. As they felt that the IRA's tactics were prolonging the fighting in Northern Ireland, McGuinness and the band members mutually decided they should withdraw from the parade. McGuinness met with one of the parade's organizers in a New York bar to arrange the cancellation, and ended up in a heated debate about the IRA. McGuinness recalled, [...] "He kept telling <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my voice down. The place was full of New York policemen - Irish cops - and he thought I was going to get us killed." ...|$|E
500|$|Jared Leto as Nemo Nobody, both 34- and 118-year-old. Nemo is a Latin {{word meaning}} [...] "nobody". The name Nemo alludes to Captain Nemo, the main {{character}} of Jules Verne's novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. It is the false name that Odysseus in Homer's poem Odyssey gives to the cyclops Polyphemus, to deceive him and save his own life. Van Dormael said that Leto was chosen because he is [...] "an actor who could transform himself, as much physically as vocally, rhythmically, his breathing." [...] Leto described his role saying, [...] "Mr. Nobody is everyone and no one {{all at the same}} time, an illusion, the product of his own dreams. He's love, he's hope, he's fear, he's life and he's death. This is without doubt the most complex character I've ever played. It was a challenge to keep all these lives concentrated into one character {{for the duration of the}} filming without losing myself. But we had outlines and things that helped <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> track of where we were." [...] Actor Toby Regbo portrays Nemo at fifteen and Thomas Byrne Nemo at nine.|$|E
500|$|Her father {{suffered}} from multiple sclerosis {{which had a}} profound emotional effect on her as she was growing up. She was determined {{to stay out of}} trouble and be a good student, which was what her father wanted for her. By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy). She attended Whitney Young High School, Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita. The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours. She recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it [...] "to fuel <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> me going." [...] She recalled experiencing gender discrimination growing up, saying, for example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought. She was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, {{was a member of the}} National Honor Society, and served as student council treasurer. She graduated in 1981 as the salutatorian of her class.|$|E

2500|$|... “For Christmas {{when we were}} kids, {{ironically}} Dia got {{the guitar}} and I got the karaoke machine. We quickly learned, however, what we were natural at and destined to become. She became really focused on her voice and began singing little country ditties at local county fairs and retirement centers. I started out playing whatever was on the radio or whatever {{happened to be in}} my buddies' CD player. My dad was a DJ in his early twenties so he had quite an extensive record collection that I listened to occasionally. After I experienced my first heartbreak and I thought the world was going to end, the natural way to console my tattered heart was to write a song. Of course my parents, being the supportive and loving caretakers they are, showered me with much undeserved praise and encouraged <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> writing. My sister and I heeded their advice and began writing and playing original songs together." [...] – Meg ...|$|E
2500|$|The group {{developed}} a reputation for exciting and polished live performances that enabled them to work even {{without the benefit of}} best-selling records. Choreographer Atkins designed [...] "fast-stepping" [...] dance routines that became a signature of the Pips' stage presentation; Atkins later described his working and personal relationship with the group in his autobiography, Class Act: The Jazz Life of Choreographer Cholly Atkins: [...] "The one thing that I was pleased about was a stipulation in my contract that allowed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> working with Gladys Knight & the Pips as personal clients even though I would be an employee of Motown Records. To tell the truth, Gordy wasn't too happy about it at first, but this is something that I would not compromise under any circumstances. By that time, Gladys and the guys were like my own children!" [...] The group was a touring standout during this period with Knight's contralto lead vocals and the Pips' impeccable choreography and characteristic background vocals becoming highlights.|$|E
2500|$|Following his conversion, Yusuf {{abandoned}} his musical career {{for nearly three}} decades. In 2007, he {{said that when he}} became a Muslim in 1977, the Imam at his mosque told him that it was fine to continue as a musician, as long as the songs were morally acceptable, but others were saying that [...] "it was all prohibited", and he decided to avoid the question by ceasing to perform. He has said that there was [...] "a combination of reasons, really", and that the continuing demands of the music business had been [...] "becoming a chore, and not an inspiration anymore". In a 2004 interview on Larry King Live, he said [...] "A lot of people would have loved <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> singing. You come to a point where you have sung, more or less... your whole repertoire and you want {{to get down to the}} job of living. You know, up until that point, I hadn't had a life. I'd been searching, been on the road." ...|$|E

2500|$|Still {{during the}} {{promotion}} of the album, the singer acknowledged that she had to follow a more honest approach on her next project: [...] " [...] just made me realize that people want authentic Monica," [...] she stated. [...] "They don't want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with all the different gimmicks and trends that are taking place." [...] In late 2007, Monica started work on her follow-up album. Intending to create a record that lived up to the sound her previous hits, particularly those from the 1990s, she expressed that she wanted to appeal to her existing fans although her label was concerned with making the project sound up to date: [...] "I am going back to where I started. The next album I would like people to get more songs like [...] "Why I Love You So Much," [...] "Angel of Mine," [...] or the things they really, really love from me [...]" [...] Originally titled Lessons Learned—a reference to the mistakes Monica felt she made with The Makings of Me – the singer decided to change the project after recording the album's title track in 2008 as she felt that Still Standing was more appropriate for the body of work that she and Bryan-Michael Cox pulled off.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{successful}} 2006, during which Aguilera released her critically acclaimed and commercially successful album, Back to Basics, Aguilera received a nomination for Grammy Award Best Pop Vocal Album at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards (2007) and won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for its lead-single [...] "Ain't No Other Man". While on the Asian {{leg of the}} Back to Basics Tour, {{during the summer of}} 2007, Aguilera said that her upcoming album would be, [...] "short, sweet and completely different" [...] from its predecessor. After the birth of her son Max, Aguilera stated in an interview with Ryan Seacrest that her forthcoming album would include a completely new aspect of herself as an artist, because of the pregnancy with her son. In a February 2008 interview with People, Aguilera stated {{that she was going to}} start recording new material for her forthcoming album at her Beverly Hills, California residence. DJ Premier, who, at the time, was working on projects for his record label Year Round Records, shared plans to head back into the studio with Aguilera, and stated: [...] "She's doing an all pop album again, but she wants <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the tone like what we did before. She's ready to start next month." [...] Linda Perry, who had previously worked with Aguilera was to be included in the project too. In an interview with Billboard in October 2008, Aguilera said that the album would be mostly produced by Perry.|$|E
2500|$|At the World Cup {{finals in}} June 2010, Argentina started by winning 1–0 against Nigeria, {{followed}} by a 4–1 victory over South Korea {{on the strength of}} a Gonzalo Higuaín hat-trick. In the final match of the group stage, Argentina won 2–0 against Greece to win the group and advance to a second round, meeting Mexico. After defeating Mexico 3–1, however, Argentina was routed by Germany 4–0 in the quarter-finals to go out of the competition. Argentina was ranked fifth in the tournament. After the defeat to Germany, Maradona admitted that he was considering his future as Argentina coach, stating, [...] "I may leave tomorrow." [...] On 15 July 2010, the AFA said that he would be offered a new four-year deal that would keep him in charge through to the summer of 2014 when Brazil stages the World Cup. On 27 July, however, the AFA announced that its board had unanimously decided not to renew his contract. Afterwards, on 29 July, Maradona claimed that AFA president Julio Grondona and director of national teams (as well as his former Argentine national team and Sevilla coach) Carlos Bilardo had [...] "lied to", [...] "betrayed" [...] and effectively sacked him from the role. He said, [...] "They wanted me to continue, but seven of my staff should not go on, if he told me that, it meant he did not want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> working." ...|$|E

2500|$|Callas herself {{appears to}} have been in {{agreement}} not only with Ardoin's assertions that she started as a natural mezzo-soprano, but also saw the similarities between herself and Pasta and Malibran. In 1957, she described her early voice as: [...] "The timbre was dark, almost black—when I think of it, I think of thick molasses", and in 1968 she added, [...] "They say I was not a true soprano, I was rather toward a mezzo". Regarding her ability to sing the heaviest as well as the lightest roles, she told James Fleetwood, It's study; it's Nature. I'm doing nothing special, you know. Even Lucia, Anna Bolena, Puritani, all these operas were created for one type of soprano, the type that sang Norma, Fidelio, which was Malibran of course. And a funny coincidence last year, I was singing Anna Bolena and Sonnambula, same months and the same distance of time as Giuditta Pasta had sung in the nineteenth century... So I'm really not doing anything extraordinary. You wouldn't ask a pianist [...] {{to be able to play}} everything; he [...] to. This is Nature and also because I had a wonderful teacher, the old kind of teaching methods... I was a very heavy voice, that is my nature, a dark voice shall we call it, and I was always kept on the light side. She always trained <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my voice limber.|$|E
