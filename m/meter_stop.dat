40|$|Abstract: After the 1995 Kobe earthquake, {{countermeasures}} against earthquakes got {{higher priority}} than before. As one of such earthquake countermeasures, Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. introduced an earthquake monitoring and rapid damage assessment system called SUPREME. This {{system has been}} under operation since 2001. The intelligent gas meters have been deployed for 9. 7 million customers {{in the area where}} Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. provides the service. The gas <b>meter</b> <b>stops</b> gas supply if earthquake motion exceeds a certain level. SUPREME has a subsystem to estimate the number of gas <b>meters</b> which <b>stop</b> gas supply because of an earthquake. However, the accuracy of estimation by this subsystem is not good because the characteristics of gas supply shutoff by the intelligent gas meter are not so clear. In this study, to improve the accuracy of estimation, the characteristics of gas supply shutoff by the intelligent gas meter are investigated based on shaking table tests and the questionnaire survey among employees of Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Two {{different}} methods for measuring biogas production were used, gas meter and gasbags. The gas meters were electronic and counted {{each time a}} certain gasvolume passed through them. The gasbags collected the gas that hade passed through the gas meter until a manual measuring could be done. The two {{different methods}} gave the same result for a volume at three liters but for a volume around 0, 2 liters they did not. Accuracy and precision for the gasbags was more exact than for the gas meters even if the method was difficult {{with a lot of}} different elements that could affect the result. The gasbag method was more complicated and took longer time than the gas meter, which was an easy working technic that wasn´t time consuming. But both of the methods gave a fall off. For the gasbags the values falled off because of leakage and for the gas meter it falled off because of dubble counting and that the <b>meters</b> <b>stopped</b> count for a while. The advantage of the gasbags is that you can measure the gas total compound. The benefit of the gas meter is that you can measure changes in the gas flow over time...|$|R

50|$|The {{focusing}} screen of the Canon EF cannot {{be replaced by}} the user. Early models feature a microprism circle, the later a split image screen with a microprism ring around it. Typical of the era, all viewfinder information is provided by mechanical arrangements, which are projected into the viewfinder by optics inside the camera housing. The range of selectable shutter speeds are always visible {{at the bottom of the}} viewfinder, with a fork outlining the currently selected speed. To the right is a scale with the aperture setting, where a needle points at the aperture the camera's exposure meter selects, and also automatically sets, provided the FD lens or FD new lens is set to the green A symbol (or green on older lenses). The largest opening the used lens is capable of is always properly shown, by shifting the whole scale up or down. The range goes from 1.2 to 5.6, in order to suit lenses from the Canon FD 55 mm 1:1.2 ASPHERICAL S.S.C. to the Canon FD 300 mm 1:5.6 S.C. The smallest aperture is not adjusted for. The camera always displays apertures up to f/22, but with a red line down to f/16, to remind the user that some lenses, like the Canon FD 50 mm 1:1.4 S.S.C. has its smallest aperture at f/16, while some, like the Canon FD 135 mm 1:2.5 S.C. can stop down to f/22.Later, when the Canon FD new lenses became available, the camera couldn't properly represent the new smallest aperture, like f/32. You had to estimate along the scale.The exposure scale also has a <b>stopped</b> down <b>metering</b> mark, where the needle should be aligned when using <b>stopped</b> down <b>metering.</b> Due to corrections taken for proper exposure with full sperture <b>metering,</b> <b>stopped</b> down <b>metering</b> with larger apertures than f/2.8 was not reliable.|$|R

[...] During test trials in Russia of a captured Ki-27, the aircraft proved superior to the Soviet I-152 (I-15bis), I-153, and the I-16 in aerial combat, as well as having a faster take-off and lower landing speed, requiring shorter airstrips than the I-16, which needed 270 <b>meters</b> to <b>stop</b> and 380 <b>meters</b> for take-off.|$|R

USSR-1 with Prokofiev, Godunov and radio operator Ernst Birnbaum on board lifted off at 8:40 Moscow Time and established radio contact with ground five minutes later. According to Prokofiev's flight log, at 9:17 am USSR-1 passed 16,800 meter mark, beating Piccard's record; between 9:19 and 9:26 the aircraft, fully expanded, levelled in a static equilibrium at 17,500 meters. Prokofiev released 80 kilograms of ballast to proceed further; after additional ballast drops at 9:47, 10:30, 11:40 and 12:00 the aircraft resumed slow ascent and at 12:55 reached 19,200-19,300 meters. Later, Prokofiev's numbers were adjusted for instrument errors to 19,000 meters max altitude at 12:45.

Only three of the original fifteen sets of traffic lights remain. Tailbacks (traffic jams) are now almost unheard of at the town's main junction, which handles about 22,000 cars a day. An evaluation of the Laweiplein scheme in Drachten concluded that traffic now flows at a constant rate and at equal speeds for motor and bicycle traffic and more freely with reduced congestion, shorter delays and improved capacity including for pedestrians. Additionally, which ties in with the philosophy of shared space and which is evidenced by the reduction in recorded accidents, public perceptions of traffic safety have declined.|$|R

Consequently, each record consisted of all the smart <b>meter</b> measurements (shower <b>stops,</b> break time, shower time, average temperature, average flow rate) as features and the sex as the target variable. Due to the dataset’s rather small size, the age and income prediction was also performed by binary classification, i.e., determine whether the person that generates a shower event is of age less than 35 years or not, or has income less than 3000 CHF or not. The features of each record were the same in all three cases.|$|R
