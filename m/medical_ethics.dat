5|$|Returning to Australia, Downes was {{discharged}} from the AIF, but remained in the Army as a reservist. He became an honorary consulting surgeon at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne and Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, and honorary surgeon at Prince Henry's Hospital. He was a founding fellow of the College of Surgeons of Australasia in 1927, and {{became president of the}} Victorian branch of the British Medical Association in 1935. He established {{a reputation as one of}} Melbourne's leading paediatric surgeons, but found himself in disagreement with certain medical practices then in vogue. In a 1922 paper published in the Medical Journal of Australia, he examined 100 cases of tonsillectomy in children, and concluded that the majority of them were unnecessary. It would be another four decades before the medical profession in Australia accepted this. He lectured on <b>medical</b> <b>ethics</b> at the University of Melbourne from the late 1930s until his death in 1945, and wrote a course textbook on the subject, entitled <b>Medical</b> <b>Ethics,</b> which was published in 1942.|$|E

AACR concurred and stripped the honor from Rhoads because of his racism.|$|E

5|$|According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{the total}} number of animals used in the US during 2015 was 820,812, down from almost 1.2 million in 2005, however, this number does not include rats and mice, which make up around 90% of {{research}} animals. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of <b>Medical</b> <b>Ethics,</b> argued that the use of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.|$|E
5|$|From 1945 to 1947, {{eighteen}} human {{test subjects}} were injected with plutonium without informed consent. The tests {{were used to}} create diagnostic tools to determine the uptake of plutonium in the body {{in order to develop}} safety standards for working with plutonium. Ebb Cade was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4.7 micrograms of Plutonium on 10 April 1945 at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This experiment was under the supervision of Harold Hodge. Other experiments directed by the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the Manhattan Project continued into the 1970s. The Plutonium Files chronicles the lives of the subjects of the secret program by naming each person involved and discussing the ethical and medical research conducted in secret by the scientists and doctors. The episode is now considered to be a serious breach of <b>medical</b> <b>ethics</b> and of the Hippocratic Oath.|$|E
5|$|Shaw's major {{plays of}} {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century address {{individual}} social, political or ethical issues. Man and Superman (1902) stands apart from the others in both its subject and its treatment, giving Shaw's interpretation of creative evolution in a combination of drama and associated printed text. The Admirable Bashville (1901), a blank verse dramatisation of Shaw's novel Cashel Byron's Profession, focuses on the imperial relationship between Britain and Africa. John Bull's Other Island (1904), comically depicting the prevailing relationship between Britain and Ireland, was popular at the time but fell out of the general repertoire in later years. Major Barbara (1905) presents ethical questions in an unconventional way, confounding expectations that in the depiction of an armaments manufacturer on the one hand and the Salvation Army on the other the moral high ground must invariably be held by the latter. The Doctor's Dilemma (1906), a play about <b>medical</b> <b>ethics</b> and moral choices in allocating scarce treatment, was described by Shaw as a tragedy. With a reputation for presenting characters who did not resemble real flesh and blood, he was challenged by Archer to present an on-stage death, and here did so, with a deathbed scene for the anti-hero.|$|E

Since that time, MES working with the CJF has grown from a small group of students with common interests to running events with university-wide participation. In the first several years, they hosted a program of on-campus lectures by experts in the field of <b>medical</b> <b>ethics</b> and Halakha (Jewish law). Topics covered have included stem cell research, cloning, do not resuscitate orders, genetic testing, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, and birth control. They also host genetic testing events to help combat the high incidence of various genetic diseases in the Jewish community. The Society hosts events throughout the year, including an annual conference focused on a chosen <b>medical</b> <b>ethics</b> topic. The events are open to all those who have an interest in learning more about Jewish <b>medical</b> <b>ethics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Historically, Western <b>medical</b> <b>ethics</b> may {{be traced}} to {{guidelines}} on the duty of physicians in antiquity, such as the Hippocratic Oath, and early Christian teachings. The first code of <b>medical</b> <b>ethics,</b> Formula Comitis Archiatrorum, {{was published in the}} 5th century, during the reign of the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great. In the medieval and early modern period, the field is indebted to Islamic scholarship such as Ishaq ibn Ali al-Ruhawi (who wrote the Conduct of a Physician, the first book dedicated to <b>medical</b> <b>ethics),</b> Avicenna's Canon of Medicine and Muhammad ibn Zakariya ar-Razi (known as Rhazes in the West), Jewish thinkers such as Maimonides, Roman Catholic scholastic thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas, and the case-oriented analysis (casuistry) of Catholic moral theology. These intellectual traditions continue in Catholic, Islamic and Jewish <b>medical</b> <b>ethics.</b>|$|E

40|$|Social {{scientists}} who employ participant observation methods in medical settings are often {{held accountable for}} their research methods, specifically in regard to <b>medical</b> research <b>ethics.</b> However, the <b>medical</b> research <b>ethics</b> tradition rubs uneasily against participant observation and the anthropological understanding of the research process. The underlying premise for considering research ethics in the current case {{is the notion of}} the vulnerability of psychiatric patients as a participant group. Based on this notion of vulnerability among psychiatric patients, this article discusses the epistemological grounds for vulnerability in anthropological and <b>medical</b> research <b>ethics.</b> The authors draw on their experience with the Regional Committee for <b>Medical</b> Research <b>Ethics</b> in Norway, and the consequences of the guidelines used for participant observation as a research method in a psychiatric hospital. Social science researchers are required to follow medical ethical guidelines, such as informed consent, the principle of voluntariness, and estimation of risks and benefits. Ethnographers have found these guidelines to be obstructive when doing social science research in a psychiatric hospital. The article suggests the need for reformulation of research guidelines for participant observation in <b>medical</b> settings.

25|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>ethics</b> is {{a system}} of moral {{principles}} that apply values {{to the practice of}} clinical medicine and in scientific research. <b>Medical</b> <b>ethics</b> allow for people, regardless of background, to be guaranteed quality and principled care. This applies to both the living and nonliving, such as medical research on cadavers. It creates an obvious guideline to follow. <b>Medical</b> <b>ethics</b> is based on a set of values that professionals can refer to in the case of any confusion or conflict. These values include the respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice. These tenets allow doctors, care providers, and families to create a treatment plan and work towards the same common goal without any conflict. It {{is important to note that}} these four values are of equal worth.|$|E
