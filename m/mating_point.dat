6000|$|His <b>mate</b> <b>pointed</b> to the lee-quarter of {{the other}} vessel, where, sure enough, a large rope was seen {{whipping}} the water, as though in the very process of being extended. The truth instantly flashed on the mind of our young mariner. The Rover lay secret-moored with a spring, {{with a view to}} bring; his guns more readily to bear upon the battery, should his defence become necessary, and he now profited, by the circumstance, in order to prevent the trader from passing to leeward. The whole arrangement excited a good deal of surprise, and not a few execrations among the officers of the [...] "Caroline;" [...] though none but her Commander had the smallest twinkling of the real reason why the kedge had thus been laid, and why a warp was so awkwardly stretched across their path. Of the whole number, the pilot alone saw cause to rejoice in the circumstance. He had, in fact, got the ship in such a situation, as to render it nearly as difficult to proceed in one way as in the other; and he was now furnished with a sufficient justification, should any accident occur, {{in the course of the}} exceedingly critical manoeuvre, from whose execution there was now no retreat.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{registration}} {{is a fundamental}} step in the reconstruction of three-dimensional objects. This is typically a two step process where an initial coarse motion estimation {{is followed by a}} refinement. Most coarse registration algorithms exploit some local point descriptor that is intrinsic to the shape and does not depend on the relative position of the surfaces. By contrast, refinement techniques iteratively minimize a distance function measured between pairs of selected neighboring points and are thus strongly dependent on initial alignment. In this paper we propose a novel technique that allows to obtain a fine surface registration in a single step, without the need of an initial motion estimation. The main idea of our approach is to cast the selection of correspondences between points on the surfaces in a gametheoretic framework, where a natural selection process allows <b>mating</b> <b>points</b> that satisfy a mutual rigidity constraint to thrive, eliminating all the other correspondences. This process yields a very robust inlier selection scheme that does not depend on any particular technique for selecting the initial strategies as it relies only on the global geometric compatibility between correspondences. The practical effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed by an extensive set of experiments and comparisons with state-ofthe-art techniques. 1...|$|R

60|$|As sheet after {{sheet of}} canvas {{fell from the}} yards, and was {{distended}} by the complicated mechanism, the interest that a seaman ever takes in his vessel began to gain the ascendancy over all other feelings By the time every thing was set, from the royals down, and the ship was cast with her head towards the harbour's mouth, our adventurer had probably forgotten (for the moment only, it is true) {{that he was a}} stranger among those he was in so extraordinary a manner selected to command, and how precious a stake was intrusted to his firmness and decision. After every thing was set to advantage, alow and aloft, and the ship was brought close upon the wind, his eye scanned every yard and sail, from the truck to the hull, and concluded by casting a glance along the outer side of the vessel, in order to see that not even the smallest rope was in the water to impede her progress. A small skiff, occupied by a boy, was towing under the lee, and, as the mass of the vessel began to move, it was skipping along the surface of the water, light and buoyant as a feather. Perceiving that it was a boat belonging to the shore, Wilder walked forward, and demanded its owner. A <b>mate</b> <b>pointed</b> to Joram, who at that moment ascended from the interior of the vessel, where he had been settling the balance due from a delinquent, or, what was in his eyes the same thing, a departing debtor.|$|R
40|$|Installation of OffshoreWind Turbine {{structural}} components need to {{be executed}} in sea states for which their dynamic responses are expected to remain within a safe domain or perform {{a limited number of}} outcrossings from the safe boundary beyond which the responses may lead to unsafe working conditions, large impact loads or even structural failure. A critical installation activity limiting the installation of a Transition Piece TP is often the motion monitoring phase of the <b>mating</b> <b>points</b> until its landing on the foundation. The operational limit is normally given by the horizontal displacement and the safe domain could conveniently be defined by a circle of radius r in the horizontal plane. This paper presents an existing general accurate method and its solution to estimate the outcrossing rate of dynamic responses for a circular safe boundary in short crested seas which is applicable for the motion monitoring phase of offshore wind turbine components prior to mating. The required input is calculated from spectral analysis in the frequency domain and the solution is derived for Gaussian processes. It is found that both 1 st and 2 nd order responses have to be included and that the Gaussian assumption for the slow drift motions is not valid so that its real PDF is required. Also wave spreading has large influence in the outcrossing rate and should realistically be applied. The suggested approach is in agreement with real offshore practice, and is efficient when compared with time domain simulations. Then, the outcrossing rate method could help on Marine Operations decision making during critical installation activities...|$|R

60|$|With {{a united}} effort they lifted {{and ran the}} boat her own length further up. The next wave barely reached the boat’s stern. Before another came she was well up on the sand. Then the <b>mate</b> <b>pointed</b> upwards. The roar of the surf and the howl of the wind would have drowned any words, but his gesture was sufficient. Most of the men had, like their officer, lost their hats, but {{those who had not}} done so took them off. Several of them, {{including}} Stephen and Joyce, threw themselves on their knees, the others stood with bent heads, and all uttered a fervent thanksgiving for their preservation from what had seemed almost certain death. The mate was the first to move. He went {{to the side of the}} boat, and began to take double handfuls of sand, and to throw them into her. The others looked at him in surprise, but he made signs that the wind might lift the boat up, whirl her round, and dash her to pieces; then all set to at the work, which they continued until the boat was half-full of sand. Then the two barrels of water were carried up, together with a bag of biscuits and a bottle of rum from the locker, where a supply was always kept in case of an emergency like the present. They went on beyond the brow of the sand-hill, and ensconced themselves in a hollow at its foot, where they were completely sheltered from the wind. The mate got out his jack-knife, and managed to get the cork out of the bottle, and pouring water from one of the breakers into a tin pannikin that formed part of the boat’s equipment, gave a ration of grog to each, and served out a biscuit all round.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt is {{striking}} that, while central to sexual reproduction, the genomic regions determining sex or mating-types are often characterized by suppressed recombination {{that leads to}} a decrease in the efficiency of selection, shelters genetic load, and inevitably contributes to their genic degeneration. Research on model and lesser-explored fungi has revealed similarities in recombination suppression of the genomic regions involved in mating compatibility across eukaryotes, but fungi also provide opposite examples of enhanced recombination in the genomic regions that determine their mating types. These contrasted patterns of genetic recombination (sensu lato, including gene conversion and ectopic recombination) in regions of the genome involved in <b>mating</b> compatibility <b>point</b> to important yet complex processes occurring in their evolution. A number of pieces in this puzzle remain to be solved, in particular on the unclear selective forces that may cause the patterns of recombination, prompting theoretical developments and experimental studies. This review thus points to fungi as a fascinating group for studying the various evolutionary forces at play in the genomic regions involved in mating compatibility...|$|R

40|$|Digital Human Modeling {{programs}} are important tools in virtual manufacturing that allow simulation of manual assembly work, long before any physical product has been built. By investigating the logistics, ergonomics {{and the interaction}} among the workers at an early stage, {{it may be possible}} to reduce the cost of design changes, increase the quality and to decrease the ramp-up time of a manufacturing process. However, far from all assembly operations are simulated, even if all the necessary data is available. One reason is the tedious work required to setup and to define all the motions needed by a manikin to perform a simulation. In each simulation, the manikin must be adjusted into the desired posture and the user must ensure that balance is held and that it avoids collision with objects in the environment. Thus, even a small case may be time consuming to simulate. This shows that there is a need of an easier way of instructing the manikins. In this work we propose a new formal high-level language for controlling an automated manikin. The language instructions are structured by a grammar, which defines a hierarchical tree for the manikin instructions. The low- level instructions contains basic functionality for maneuvering the manikin, such as Move, Position and Grasp, and higher levels contain more abstract instructions such as Get and Assemble. Thus, the high-level instructions define sequences of other instructions, whereas a low-level instruction corresponds to a direct instruction of the manikin. The set of available instructions that the manikin may perform during a simulation depends on the current state of the manikin and the objects at the assembly station. Thus, properties of objects, such as grasping and <b>mating</b> <b>points,</b> also help define the set of available instructions for the manikin. The order in which the different parts in the assembly operations have to be connected may also be considered when constructing instruction sequences for the manikin. Furthermore, the instruction sequences may be formally verified to ensure that the manikin only performs valid instructions. The language have been implemented in the manikin simulation software IMMA and tested on elementary cases with relevance to industrial applications. The results show that fewer steps are needed to perform a realistic simulation when the language is used compared to manually instructing the manikin. Furthermore, it is also shown that the instructions generated by the language are formally correct...|$|R
