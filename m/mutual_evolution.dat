In The Ascended Masters on Soulmates and Twin Flames the Prophet’s state that “A soulmate relationship {{has to do with the}} seat of the soul chakra, that chakra just above the base.

With the chakra [...] "just above the base" [...] often being described as “the creativity and sexual chakra”, the Prophet’s claim that a true “literal other half” relationship doesn't center around energies or activities believed to be related to the sacral chakra is not completely inconsistent with the claims Plato makes about a literal other half relationship in his Symposium. In his Symposium, Plato has the character Aristophanes relate that “the intense yearning which each of them has towards the other does not appear to be the desire of lover's intercourse, but of something else.” In The Ascended Masters on Soulmates and Twin Flames, the Prophet’s state that “if you really meditate at inner levels, you know that that relationship doesn’t go as high or is not as profound as the one with the person who is your direct counterpart—the twin flame you have known as your other self from the first moment of your creation.” ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the phenomenon of <b>mutual</b> knowledge <b>evolution</b> in team working using protocol data. The focus is on whether <b>mutual</b> knowledge <b>evolution</b> in agents exists, and if so, what triggers this phenomenon. Section 2 presents the nature of team design. Team design is a collective problem solving and knowledge co-constructed process (Bonner, 1959; Nguifo et al, 1999). When members in a design team work together, they can therefore produce a result that individuals may not readily produce, which is called team synergy (Prasad, 1995). Section 3 presents the hypothesis that designers can mutually evolve their design idea and learn from each other. An example of <b>mutual</b> knowledge <b>evolution</b> process is posited. In section 4, the analysis of <b>mutual</b> knowledge <b>evolution</b> using protocol data is carried out. Through the analysis, the phenomenon of <b>mutual</b> knowledge <b>evolution</b> has been observed and the reasons that trigger the phenomenon have been discussed. The conclusion is made in section 5 and future research has been identified. Collective learning in team design has been presented by Wu and Duffy (Wu and Duffy, 2002). In this paper the focus is specifically on investigating <b>mutual</b> knowledge <b>evolution,</b> i. e., a design phenomenon in which the agents mutually evolve their design knowledge and co-construct the design solution...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} multi-agent {{learning}} and adaptation {{has attracted a}} great deal of attention in recent years. It has been suggested that the dynamics of multi agent learning can be studied using replicator equations from population biology. Most existing studies so far have been limited to discrete strategy spaces with a small number of available actions. In many cases, however, the choices available to agents are better characterized by continuous spectra. This paper suggests a generalization of the replicator framework that allows to study the adaptive dynamics of Q-learning agents with continuous strategy spaces. Instead of probability vectors, agents strategies are now characterized by probability measures over continuous variables. As a result, the ordinary differential equations for the discrete case are replaced by a system of coupled integral [...] differential replicator equations that describe the <b>mutual</b> <b>evolution</b> of individual agent strategies. We derive a set of functional equations describing the steady state of the replicator dynamics, examine their solutions for several two-player games, and confirm our analytical results using simulations.

The outputs of these situations are influenced by an identical factor: the paradoxical importance of misunderstanding, which relies on the weak implementation of the strong equipment, patiently elaborated. The first case is examined with a limited approach of this general perspective: experts in medicine and dentistry who try to rationalize their colleagues' practices via guidelines, may be considered as specimen of the classical exercise; members of a symphonic orchestra who cooperate with pupils in specific projects with the help of professors and animators, may portray the aim for participative situations.

40|$|Arable weeds are {{plants that}} invade {{habitats}} created by {{people for the}} cultivation of other species. Though {{they are not the}} target of human cultivation, their growth in arable habitats means that they, like crops, are under human selection. Genetic studies of weedy crop relatives have documented traits (shattering/dehiscence, asynchronous flowering, seed dormancy etc.) that allow weeds to escape detection and eradication by farmers, and give them a competitive advantage over crops (Thurber et al. 2010, 2011; Qi et al. 2015). Selection of these traits in weedy crop relatives thus constitutes a (partial) reversal of the domestication syndrome (Hammer 1984), sometimes called ‘de-domestication’ (Ellstrand et al. 2010). But weeds can also adapt by taking on domestic traits (Hammer 1984); Harlan (1992 : 66, 94) reports non-shattering populations of the weed Bromus secalinus and of weedy oats, for example. Moreover, genetic study of wild crop relatives and their domesticated counterparts has confirmed the importance of allele introgression from proximate wild populations (Song et al. 2014; Gutaker et al. 2017).

40|$|More {{than a few}} Occidental {{scholars}} have criticized the English-language essays of D. T. Suzuki on Zen Buddhism. Suzuki often says, “Zen claims to be above logic and verbal interpretation,” as if he regarded “Zen” as a mystical and irrational secret. This is why Suzuki’s way of thinking has been considered {{as a sort of}} empiricism or nativism. In fact, Suzuki’s treatment of Zen includes a great number of Zen documents found in Dunhuang, in particular in his Japanese essays titled Study of the Intellectual History of Zen Buddhism（『禅思想史研究』）. Thus, it is necessary to illustrate the real aspect of what Suzuki discusses in his Japanese essays, in order to characterize his study on the intellectual history of Zen Buddhism. This essay first examines the polemic between Suzuki and Hu Shih to ascertain whether Suzuki really accentuates Zen’s “irrationality. ” Suzuki does not ignore Zen’s historicity and rationality, but he plays up the role of Prajñā as “transcendental wisdom” in Zen historical documents, painstakingly scrutinizing issues related to satori. Next, it reviews Suzuki’s Japanese essays written in the 1930 s and 40 s to outline his comprehensive understanding of the reciprocal and <b>mutual</b> <b>evolution</b> between subitism (tongo 頓悟) and gradualism (zengo 漸悟) or between kōan practice (kanna 看話) and “silent illumination” (mokusho 黙照).

40|$|From {{the advent}} of {{electronic}} music, and even from early organ consoles and other remote manipulated instruments, much of the design and research of new musical interfaces has focused on abstracting (both physically and in the design process) the “controller ” from the “synthesizer ” and then investigating how to best interface those two classes of hardware {{with each other and}} the player. Yet, many of the striking lessons from our history of intimate expressive musical instruments lie in the blurred boundaries between player, controller, and sound producing object. Bowed strings, winds, and certainly the human voice all blur these boundaries, both in the design and construction of the “instrument” and in the resulting controls and expressions. This article looks at some of the issues involved with creating new expressive electronic musical instruments, and presents an overview of a number of recent projects in the co-design of musical controllers and computer sound synthesis algorithms. Specific cases are described where the traditional engineering approach of building a controller (a box), and connecting it to a synthesizer (another box) would never have yielded the final product that resulted from the tightly coupled development of a complete musical system all at the same time. Examples are given of where a discovery from synthesis algorithm development suggested a new control metaphor, and where a control component suggested a new aspect of synthesis. 1 The term “remutualize ” is a new term coined by the author, to reflect the central idea that instrument design used {{to be the result of}} <b>mutual</b> <b>evolution</b> of performer and craft, and that, with care, designers can reintroduce this symbiosis in our modern electronic instruments...|$|E

Generally speaking, there are transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom of the memory that one can address by a proper choice of the pump (control) field spatial pattern. Here we concentrate on the <b>mutual</b> <b>evolution</b> and transformation of quantum states of the longitudinal modes of collective spin coherence in the cavity-based memory scheme. We assume that these modes are coherently controlled by the pump waves of the on [...] demand transverse profile, that is, by the superpositions of waves propagating in the directions, close to orthogonal to the cavity axis. By the write-in, this allows one to couple a time sequence of the incoming quantized signals to a given set of superpositions of orthogonal spin waves. By the readout, one can retrieve quantum states of the collective spin waves that are controllable superpositions of the initial ones and are on demand coupled to the output signal sequence. In general case, the memory is able to operate as a controllable delayed multi-port beamsplitter, capable of transformation of the delays, the durations and time shapes of signals in the sequence. We elaborate the theory of such light [...] matter interface for the spatially multivariate cavity-based off [...] resonant Raman [...] type quantum memory. Since in order {{to speed up the}} manipulation of complex signals in multivariate memories it might be of interest to store relatively short light pulses of a given time shape, we also address some issues of the cavity-based memory operation beyond the bad cavity limit.

40|$|Rock {{strength}} is generally divided into {{the components of}} cohesion and internal friction. These components are two important parameters for estimating the damaged or disturbed zone around an excavation and its corresponding support design. However, the cohesive and frictional strength components at the same strain increment before peak strength are difficult to separate from each other. In addition, the misperception of their <b>mutual</b> <b>evolution</b> has been in existence for a long time. A numerical code, Rock Failure Process Analysis (RFPA² D), based on the finite element method {{was used in this}} study to clarify this misperception. The RFPA² D approach can account for rock heterogeneity and capture the entire rock failure process without prior assumptions regarding where and how microcracks and fracturing develop. Numerical models of rock were copied and reused in uniaxial and biaxial tests to create identical heterogeneous models for use under different confining stress conditions. Forty-five numerical tests (5 homogeneity indexes[*]×[*] 9 confining pressures) were used to calculate the results of the principal stresses (σ₁ and σ₃) at specified increments of axial strain. The intercept and the slope of a linear line fitting to the principal stresses at the same strain before peak strength were obtained in the principal stress space. The intercept is related to the cohesive strength component of the shear resistance, and the slope of the linear line is a pseudo-internal friction coefficient. Through the analysis of the linear fitting results, it has been found that the cohesive strength component increases while the pseudo-internal friction coefficient decreases with increasing homogeneity index of the numerical rock models. The values of cohesion and internal friction vary {{as a function of the}} strain state, and they are immediately activated with a strain increment before peak strength. The research results strengthen the understanding of the mobilization of the load-bearing capacity of rock mass surrounding an opening and can improve the design of practical support systems...|$|E

40|$|In this master's thesis, I {{will study}} the {{connection}} between the field of communication, language and speech, and arts therapy. I will also discuss the possibility of integrating arts therapy into treatment for speech and language disorders. This connection between the two fields was chosen because of an anticipated <b>mutual</b> <b>evolution</b> dating back to the Homo sapiens, symbolic thinking, which is the base for both, and studies, proving that language is not limited to a specific area of our brain, but rather that in order to function properly it combines together many areas, similar as in art. Through multiple areas of the brain working together we enable a whole development of communication, language and speech, and of an individual as well. Art offers an excellent staring point in nonverbal communication, which can be developed into a verbal communication. The nonverbal base can serve as a safe haven, through which we step into an area that needs support, development, which in this case is the verbal part of communication. We discuss fields of arts therapy and introduce in greater detail drama therapy, which was the base for preparing the activity, described in my empirical part of the thesis. I described the similarities in cerebral processing of art and of communication, language and speech. There are some activities, which, based on the literature, can help to develop various areas of communication, language and speech. The activities are divided based on the areas, not disorders. The therapist can use them as a guideline while planning other activities. In connection with my research, I tested some of these activities on a girl with multiple speech and language disorders. My focus was on drama therapy, because it includes all fields of arts therapy. Hoping for a better effect, l also tried to include at least two more fields of arts therapy, beside communication, language and speech. The results of the study have shown that the girl excepted the integrated technics of arts therapy into treatment for communication, speech and language disorders with greater enthusiasm and motivation, which in some cases resulted in a faster mastering of a skill. Connecting both fields offers us a variety of opportunities, not only for making the treatment more interesting and diverse, but for developing a whole treatment, which exceeds the separation into voices and words, and develops communication as well as the individual in the broader sense...|$|E
40|$|The UK disposes of 1. 25 {{million tonnes}} of {{domestic}} electronic products (DEPs) each year, {{the majority of}} which still perform their tasks perfectly, in a utilitarian sense.

Ã‚Â·ln this way, {{it is clear that}} design for durability has important implications beyond its conventional interpretation, in which product longevity is considered solely in terms of an object's physical endurance whether cherished or discarded. This thesis explores the emotional dimension of design for durability to provide a more progressive set of sustainable design propositions; arguing that consumer desires continually evolve and adapt whilst the DEPs deployed to both mediate and satisfy those desires remain relatively frozen in time; this incapacity for <b>mutual</b> <b>evolution</b> renders most DEPs incapable of both establishing and sustaining a relationships with users. The waste this inconsistency generates is considerable, and comes at an increasing cost to manufacturers facing the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive, but more importantly, the natural world. This thesis explores 3 converging fields of knowledge: sustainable product design, emotional and user-centred design, and consumer motivation. Although the literature reviewed in this thesis presents selected discourses that articulate the need for longer lasting domestic electronic products, practical working methods, design frameworks and tools that enable the commercial implementation of such artefacts, have yet to be realised. This study argues that the apparently intangible, ethereal nature of considerations pertaining to psychological function cause confusion for the practicing designer tasked with the design and development of greater emotional longevity in D. EPs. As a result, the potentially positive impact(s) of academic studies in this area has thus far failed to penetrate the working practices and methodologies of design - arguably, the one place where new models of sustainable design knowledge and understanding are most urgently needed. The aim of this thesis is to generate new and practical design information that enables product designers to engage more effectively with complex issues of emotional durability through design; presenting a more expansive, holistic approach to design for durability, and more broadly, the lived-experience of sustainability. The three core contributions made by this thesis are thus; (1) the implicit development of a 6 -point experiential framework to structure inquiry and exploration into salient issues of emotional durability through design; (2) the design and production of 6 experimental DEPs, which exemplify ways of working with the 6 point experiential framework; (3) the development of an original, and transferable, methodology for developing case-specific design knowledge to address emotionally durable design.

40|$|Algumas a????es do processo projetual se restringem aos pensamentos dos {{designers}}, gerando uma dificuldade para compreender o processo e torn??-lo expl??cito. As pesquisas nessa ??rea tentam transpor essas limita????es, buscando perceber o modo como os designers resolvem os problemas para aprimorar a sua atua????o. Esses problemas s??o caracterizados como mal-estruturados e podem ser vistos de diferentes perspectivas, gerando respostas distintas. O conceito de coevolu????o percebe a resolu????o de problemas de forma evolutiva: ?? medida que compreende-se um pouco mais o problema, as respostas tornam-se mais aprimoradas. Esta disserta????o tem como objetivo geral compreender a coevolu????o do problema de design. Para isso, realizou-se uma pesquisa explorat??ria em um workshop em design, coletando as informa????es por meio de grupos focais e do registro, em v??deo, do processo realizado pelos participantes. A t??cnica utilizada para analisar as informa????es coletadas nos grupos focais e nos v??deos foi a an??lise de conte??do, com algumas adapta????es necess??rias ?? pesquisa realizada. Na an??lise, percebeu-se que a coevolu????o ?? influenciada: 1) pela formula????o inicial do problema que funciona como uma for??a motora, impulsionando o processo de resolu????o do problema; 2) pela forma como as equipes se articulam, levando-se em conta o modo como os integrantes desempenham diferentes papeis e estabelecem um ritmo de resolu????o do problema de acordo com experi??ncias anteriores que trazem para o projeto; 3) pelos questionamentos em rela????o ao problema ou ?? solu????o, caracterizando-se como uma das estrat??gias utilizadas pelos designers para avan??ar no espa??o-problema ou no espa??o-solu????o. Concluiu-se, assim, que n??o s?? o espa??o-problema e o espa??o-solu????o se modificam no percurso do projeto de forma a provocar uma evolu????o m??tua, mas os diversos fatores que envolvem o processo projetual tamb??m influenciam na coevolu????o do problema de design. Some {{actions in}} the design process are restricted to the designers??? thoughts, what may cause some difficulties in understanding the process itself and making it explicit. Studies in this area attempt to overcome these limitations by looking into the way designers solve problems to improve their performance. These problems are usually characterized as ill-structured and {{can be seen from}} different perspectives, leading to distinct answers. The concept of co-evolution regards problem resolution in an evolutive manner: as the problem is better understood, the answers become more refined. The overall objective of this work is to understand the co-evolution of the design problem. In order to do this, an exploratory research was conducted within a design workshop, where data was collected by means of both focal groups and videos recording the participants??? process. The technique used to analyse all this data was Content Analysis, with some necessary adaptations to the context of the present research. In the analysis, it was possible to observe that co-evolution is influenced by: 1) the initial formulation of the problem that works as a driving force, boosting the problem resolution process; 2) the way the groups manage themselves, taking into consideration the manner in which different members play distinct roles and establish a problem resolution pace based on previous experiences they bring to the project; and 3) inquiries related to the problem or the solution, which can be {{regarded as one of the}} strategies used by designers to move forward into the problem space or the solution space. In conclusion, all these observations lead to the understanding that not only the problem space and the solution space modify themselves in the course of the project, triggering <b>mutual</b> <b>evolution,</b> but the diverse aspects involved in the design context also have some influence on the co-evolution of the design problem...|$|E
5000|$|When {{solidarity}} is organic, anomie is impossible. Sensitivity to <b>mutual</b> needs promotes <b>evolution</b> in {{the division}} of labour. [...] "Producers, being near consumers, can easily reckon {{the extent of the}} needs to be satisfied. Equilibrium is established without any trouble and production regulates itself." [...] Durkheim contrasted the condition of anomie as being the result of a malfunction of organic solidarity after the transition to mechanical solidarity: But on the contrary, if some opaque environment is interposed... relations are rare, are not repeated enough... are too intermittent. Contact is no longer sufficient. The producer can no longer embrace the market at a glance, nor even in thought. He can no longer see its limits, since it is, so to speak limitless. Accordingly, production becomes unbridled and unregulated.|$|R

For economic theory these are the years of the Great Crossroads when economic theory was at critical breaking point, after which several powerful theoretical streams emerged that were to determine later on the overall course of the evolution of economics. The book by the French economist and philosopher Gilles Campagnolo is an attempt {{to find out exactly what}} happened in the years of the Great Crossroads.

Conclusions about limits of applicability of methods in disclosing several features are achieved. A set of molecules: D 2, CD 4, D 2 O, ND 3, CD 3 OD and (CD 3) 2 CO was chosen and introduced into zeolites with faujasite structure. Measurements of deuteron spectra and relaxation in function of loading and temperature provide a wealth of cases. A tranistion from translational into rotational mobility on decreasing temperature was a common obsevation. Fast magnetization exchange between two subsystems with different mobility was considered as a model. Existence of D 2 O clusters and trimers of CD 3 OD was a particularly significant evidence for importance of <b>mutual</b> ineractions. <b>Evolution</b> of spectral components, derivation of the activation energy and T 1 /T 2 ratio are among analysed features. Choice of the zeolite, eg. NaY or NaX, introduces specific inertactions with the zeolite framework. Temperature at wich molecules become immobilized on cage walls {{is related to the}} strength of the interactions. On increasing temperature we may observe features like for layers of liquid on cage walls and gaseus state. In general properly chosen molecules may be used for characterization of host microporous systems...|$|R
