The 0402 code covered seven exchanges in a linked numbering scheme, with an additional digit for each exchange, as below. Internally, the 0402 code was translated to routing digits by registers to the same string of digits as 0708 plus an additional 8, which corresponded to the 8 in the local code from Romford Group Switching Centre to the local exchange. This technique was used to keep the dialled string down to the 10 digit limit that was imposed (though Stapleford only had 3 digit local numbers and South Ockendon 4 digits and so these could be dialled as 0708 8x xxx as well as the official 0402x xxx / xxxx.) ...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{with minor}} closed head {{injuries}} {{have been found}} to demonstrate a specific deficit in the recall of concrete material, which indicates an impairment in the use of mental imagery as a <b>mnemonic</b> <b>code.</b> The present study found a similar pattern of results when patients with either minor or severe closed head injuries were compared with other accident victims. Both the headinjured subjects and their matched controls demonstrated an additional impairment in immediate free recall, which was attributed to a reduced working-memory capacity. Any serious accident appears to impair human cognitive function in a generalised manner by acting as a source of situational stress. This has important implications for the choice of an appropriate control group in research into closed head injury. When compared with orthopaedic patients tested at similar intervals after their accidents, head-injured patients show a disturbance of memory function which is entirely attributable to a reduced capacity to employ mental imagery as an elaborative <b>mnemonic</b> <b>code...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractAmygdala neuroplasticity {{has emerged}} as a {{candidate}} substrate for Pavlovian fear memory. By this view, conditional stimulus (CS) -evoked activity represents a <b>mnemonic</b> <b>code</b> that initiates the expression of fear behaviors. However, a fear state may nonassociatively enhance sensory processing, biasing CS-evoked activity in amygdala neurons. Here we describe experiments that dissociate auditory CS-evoked spike firing in the lateral amygdala (LA) and both conditional fear behavior and LA excitability in rats. We found that the expression of conditional freezing and increased LA excitability was neither necessary nor sufficient for the expression of conditional increases in CS-evoked spike firing. Rather, conditioning-related changes in CS-evoked spike firing were solely determined by the associative history of the CS. Thus, our data support a model in which associative activity in the LA encodes fear memory and contributes to the expression of learned fear behaviors...|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{architectural}} {{design and the}} successful implementation of form-active structures depend directly {{on the availability of}} relevant information and experience. Formfinder Professional offers a new set of "building shape and building context classification " to access knowledge of existing databases in the field of form-active structures. 1 WORKING CONCEPT Historically, form-active structures 1 are distributed all over the planet. Therefore it is essential to travel and visit buildings and to contact involved project partners to learn from already implemented building structures. If travelling is not possible or project partners are not available the latest information technologies like the internet allow an improvement on information sharing. Developments like the SDA 2 or TensiNet 3 increased the availability of information on form-active structures. The SDA "shape and structural annotation in a <b>mnemonic</b> <b>code</b> " 4 and the "classification of tensile membrane constructions " 5 by TensiNet are positive steps in the direction to support designer with database information. Currently database attribution and classifications are still very limited and therefore the database of Formfinder Professional was equipped with an "advanced typology classification"...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{with minor}} closed head {{injuries}} {{have been found}} to show a specific deficit in the recall of concrete material, which suggests an impairment in the use of mental imagery as a <b>mnemonic</b> <b>code.</b> The first experiment in the present investigation compared the recognition of unfamiliar faces by head-injured and control patients. The second experiment studied the free recall of pictured objects. In neither case did the head-injured patients demonstrate a significant impairment, which was taken to mean that minor closed head injury has a selective effect upon the encoding of verbal information in the form of mental images. The third experiment compared the free recall of lists of concrete and abstract nouns by head-injured and control patients under either standard learning instructions or imagery mnemonic instructions. Under the standard instructions, head-injured patients demonstrated a selective deficit in the recall of concrete material. However, under interactive imagery instructions, both head-injured and control patients showed superior performance with concrete material, and {{there was no sign of}} any difference between the two groups of subjects. The effects of minor closed head injury upon human memory are interpreted as a functional deficit attributable to the patients' failure to employ the optional mnemonic strategy of constructing interactive images. The results suggest that an appropriate approach for dealing with cases of psychological dysfunction following brain injury would be to provide training in the use of relevant cognitive strategies...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOne of {{the main}} aims {{of this article was}} to present {{concrete}} arguments which will show that we are indeed dealing with an original writing system, and not with pictography or with some sort of <b>mnemonic</b> <b>code</b> for preserving information or with any other pre-literary form. We need these arguments because many professional philologists and cultural historians are still sceptical about the written texts of Easter Island. The scepticism of philologists who are acquainted with the history of the development of the world’s writing systems is entirely justified from the typological point of view: original systems of writing are not known to have come into being on distant islands, thousands of miles from the nearest shore, which have spent many centuries in complete cultural isolation. For this aim we used various statistical tests. The problem was that statistics ruled out many erroneous approaches to decipherment. If we use a wrong catalog of signs, it is clear that our counts will lead to a wrong conlusions. It was a case of Rongorongo. There was no any reliable catalog of Rongorongo signs (all the scolars used the catalog of Barthel which contains many ligatures and allographs). So in this article I have published for the first time my own catalog based on the analysis of all parllel texts and fragments. Our statistics based on this catalog differs radically from previous statistical data. According to a dozen statistical criteria, there is a strike correlation between the Rapanui language and the Rongorongo writing. The following conclusions can be drawn:a) we are dealing with a proper writing system; b) this writing system is based upon the Rapanui language (or a language with similar statistical characteristics, for instance another East Polynesian language); c) the writing system is primarily syllabic (nevertheless, statistical analysis of the samples of the language does suggest that some of the glyphs in the Rongorongo writing may represent words rather than syllables) ...|$|E

Optimizing energy expenditure or environmental control is not possible with conventional controls. Improper adjustment of thermostats can result in ventilation rates above the minimum while the supplemental heater is operating. Thermostats can provide undesirable environmental fluctuations. Variable-speed fan controls have difficulties with accuracy and reliability. Operators avoid the use of complex control systems because of their inability to set the controls properly;A single-board microcomputer was selected to provide logical control of the livestock environment. Inside and outside dry-bulb temperature inputs utilize a semiconductor sensor whose current output varies with absolute dry-bulb temperature. A dew-point temperature sensor measures the moisture content of the environment. The static pressure transducers include diaphragms and linear Hall effect sensors. Fan speeds are counted with pulses from digital Hall effect sensors. Operator inputs, the desired dry-bulb temperatures, are attained with the adjustment of the potentiometers. An 8 -bit analog-to-digital converter is interfaced to the microcomputer;Solid state relays control the power to single-speed fans, supplemental heater solenoids, and air inlet motors for air distribution. Eight-bit digital-to-analog converters provide signals to prototype speed controllers which manipulate variable-speed fans. The direction of the air inlet motors is controlled by electromagnetic relays. The operator adjusts the minimum ventilation rate of the variable-speed fans;Software, located in erasable programmable read-only-memory, presents a rational correlation between the ventilation, supplemental heating, and air distribution systems. The ventilation and supplemental heating systems attempt to provide the desired temperatures. The degree of change in ventilation rates is determined by the outside temperature. Variable-speed and single-speed fans function logically together to reduce abrupt fluctuations in airflow. The dew-point temperature is monitored to limit the relative humidity. The micrcomputer utilizes the fan rpm sensors to prevent winds from stalling variable-speed fans. Static pressure is regulated by the air inlets to maintain uniform air distribution. Fans, for summer ventilation, are utilized only during stressful weather conditions, thus conserving electrical energy.

40|$|Histories give little {{attention}} to language dominance in school and community [...] {{to the fact that}} the past one-hundred years of 2 ̆ 2 One People, One Language, One School 2 ̆ 2 attitudes, policies, and goals in Anglo-American schools and communities have brought with them the demise of Native-American languages, the disappearance of linguistic differences due to immigrant origin, the disvalue or stereotype of linguistic patterns derived from regional and ethnic variation, and the insistence on English as a mark of linguistic and intellectual virtue. Telling Stories (0 ut of School) of Mother Tongue, God 2 ̆ 7 s Tongue, and the Queen 2 ̆ 7 s Tongue: An Ethnography in Canada gives attention to one such history. Told in Mennonite perspective and framed in Manitoba schools between 1890 and 1990, Telling Stories (Out of School) begins with tales of English-speaking Canadian insistence on and German-speaking Mennonite resistance to English-only language education policies in public and private schools serving a Mennonite speech community in southern Manitoba. The research problem links itself historically to a series of language education acts passed by the Manitoba Legislature, adjudicated by the Manitoba Attorney General, the Canadian Supreme Court, and the British Privy Council, and enforced by the Manitoba Department of Education [...] all between 1890 and 1920. These English-only policies, deemed an expedient response to the question of how to unify English Canadians, French-Canadians, Aboriginals, and immigrants, abrogated the language education rights of all linguistic minorities. English prevailed in Manitoba schools until the 1960 s. After the mid- 1960 s, though, the Canadian Parliament in concert with the Manitoba Legislature, the Manitoba Department of Education, and local public school districts re-affirmed Canada 2 ̆ 7 s English-French legacy as well as its multilingual, multicultural heritage with yet another series of language and language education acts [...] the Canadian Official Languages Act of 1969, the Canadian Constitution Act of 1982, and the Canadian Multicultural Act of 1988.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} nature of {{contemporary}} sculptural practices {{in relation to the}} broader field of installed sculpture (which deploy articulated, interrelated, but autonomous components) and in the context of recent approaches to both curation and display. The artistic work and attendant commentary constitute a response to the issues of sculptural agency and display raised by both the practice-based outcomes and key works of several contemporary artists: Gabriel Kuri, Gedi Sibony, Melanie Counsell, Marc Camille Chaimowicz and Michael Dean. In a number of exhibitions ‘post-installation’ practices and the function of ‘montage’ sculpture is examined. Through outlining the current landscape of sculptural production and medium specificity a progressive notion of the monument is established. The sculptural artwork is seen to retain a political resistance, as both art-object and thing in the world. An assessment is made of how sculptures produce space within and through their exhibition context, directly related to the production of space as a whole (a social morphology posited by Henri Lefebvre). Applying a conception of time in reference to spatial production opens up the artwork’s potential to draw on complex <b>codes</b> of <b>mnemonic</b> function, which can potentially generate emancipatory agency from ideological issues in late-capitalism. Re-readings of key installed works by Marc Camille Chaimowicz and Mark Dean, through contexts derived from Nietzsche and Mark Fisher, reveal how sculptures can activate specific <b>mnemonic</b> <b>codes,</b> or collective memory. Such art works utilise a ‘forgetful memory’ – a reflexive process of positing, junking and reimagining relationships to cultural information. The body of artistic work produced for this research, intertwined with its critical reflection, makes an original contribution to knowledge by interrogating theoretically and experientially the potentials of ‘the sculptural’, as part of the plural production of art and exhibition-making. By means of practice and its outcomes, the research engages the current dynamics of spatial production and radicality of sculptural objecthood.
