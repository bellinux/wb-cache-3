5000|$|The <b>mortise</b> <b>chisel,</b> {{even in its}} heavyweight [...] "pigsticker" [...] form, is used {{differently}} from a twybill, although the two may be used together. The twybill cuts the sides of mortices, along the grain. Its action is a splitting and prying one, so only requires a handle for leverage and is never struck. Mortise chisels are used for heavy chopping across the grain, are nearly always struck, and are used to square up the ends of square-ended mortises. Both tools are used for levering out chunks when first clearing out a mortise and so have similarly shaped bevels, often with a curved bevel surface for a better fulcrum action.|$|E
50|$|The Hess log {{farmhouse}} {{originally had}} 33 vertical posts, of which most survive. The horizontal timbers are tenoned into <b>mortises</b> <b>chiseled</b> into the posts. At each {{mortise and tenon}} is a chiseled-in guide symbol, consisting of a Roman numeral or other directional mark. Each corner has two interior diagonal braces. The four corner posts are tenoned into interlocking sill logs.|$|R

50|$|Japanese chisel (nomi 鑿). These come in {{a larger}} variety of types and {{gradations}} than the Western chisel. There are bench chisels, paring chisels, striking chisels, heavy timber chisels and slicks, and myriad others for specialized applications. Like the planes, the blades are of laminated hard steel/soft steel construction. Bevel angle varies from 20˚ to 35˚ typically, with <b>mortising</b> and heavy <b>chisels</b> featuring steep angles, and paring chisels having shallower angles. It is common in Japan to work with softwoods, so many chisels are made with that in mind, and require the bevels be steepened if employed for harder woods.|$|R
