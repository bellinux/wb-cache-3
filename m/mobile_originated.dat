As a result, the LCS sub-working group was created under ANSI T1P1.5. This group went on to select positioning methods and standardize Location Services (LCS), later known as Location Based Services (LBS). Nodes defined include the Gateway Mobile Location Centre (GMLC), the Serving Mobile Location Centre (SMLC) and concepts such as <b>Mobile</b> <b>Originating</b> Location Request (MO-LR), Network Induced Location Request (NI-LR) and Mobile Terminating Location Request (MT-LR). These use models were not really functional at the application context layer and needed more user-interface controls to make them ubiquitous. Those control came from Glassey's evolving models which expanded these and provided a secondary, more robust and very simple system for controlling digital objects and decision processes based on location and time.|$|R

Some providers allow users to request delivery reports, either via the SMS settings of most modern phones, or by prefixing each message with *0# or *N#. However, the exact meaning of confirmations varies from reaching the network, to being queued for sending, to being sent, to receiving a confirmation of receipt from the target device, and users are often not informed of the specific type of success being reported.|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of mobile {{telecommunication}} to meet demanding end user requirements in terms of quality of experience and service, different protocol specifications have been defined ranging from GSM to WCDMA and now LTE which includes LTE-Advanced. Specifications of these protocols are being revised on a frequent basis and thus bringing more challenges at development side. For the development teams, tracking and analyzing the cause of failure in protocol stacks is a daunting task and consumes valuable engineering resources {{where they have to}} use conventional debugging methods. One widely used conventional method till now is to generate logs and ask an expert to analyze and interpret issues against protocol specifications by scanning through hundreds of lines of traces. This master thesis describes an implementation of a Generic Log Analyzer which can ease the analysis of logs generated across the fields. The experiment to verify the validity of the log analyzer was done using two different log formats. The first one was a formal and consistent format and most of the information was coded. It was learned that the log analyzer can point out missing signals/messages from the scenarios in log files after decoding the log messages. Two scenarios were selected for formal file format, namely <b>Mobile</b> <b>Originated</b> Call and Mobile Terminated Call from 3 GPP specifications. The second selected file format was informal and inconsistent because there was no standard defined format for log entries and one log file can have multiple types of message formats. It was learned that the log analyzer not only filtered out required messages but also reports problematic areas in the selected scenario where the mobile phone transitions from one to another state frequently. The scenario selected for the informal type of format was “Power on” of a mobile device as per defined in the 3 GPP specifications. After the experiments were conducted, it was learned that such a tool can be extended to domain specific rules to add more intelligence if the rule framework was provided for the end user. Thus, such a tool can not only consolidate experience at a single place and help intended users to find minor to advanced level problems in the log files. It can also act as a watchdog to ensure system quality by reporting level of test coverage based on finding scenarios from logs generated during the system test.

40|$|Abstract — One of the {{challenges}} faced by telecom companies is to provide robust and powerful servers that are capable to handle the great increase {{of the number of}} subscribers and to accomplish the heavy Internet-based applications that generate a tremendous traffic load. Companies evaluate their products’ performance before releasing them to the market by applying a large amount of generated traffic to the telecom servers in order to measure their capability under traffic load; powerful solutions are hence needed for generating traffic and modeling various telecom protocols. In this paper, we propose a new traffic generator solution to load the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) for the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). This traffic generator loads the MSC through various mobile call scenarios such as location update, <b>mobile</b> call <b>originating,</b> <b>mobile</b> call terminating, and call clearing. We utilize the UML Use Case Model to describe the functional behaviors of the traffic generator, and present the UML Analysis Model that provides the logical implementation of the functional behaviors of the proposed traffic generator...|$|R
