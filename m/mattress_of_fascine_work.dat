50|$|In World War II the use <b>of</b> <b>fascines</b> {{continued}} as a gap crossing device {{and within the}} British Army these were launched from the Churchill AVRE - a Royal Engineer derivative of the standard Churchill tank (40 tons).|$|R
50|$|Several {{projects}} {{were based on}} the R 35 such as a number <b>of</b> <b>fascine</b> carriers: these had frames or other contraptions mounted over the hull or turret with a fascine in them that could be dropped to fill trenches.|$|R

50|$|Fascine bundles {{were used}} in {{military}} defences for revetting (shoring up) trenches or ramparts, especially around artillery batteries, or filling in ditches from earlier military actions. They were also used as a visual obstruction, providing cover for sappers and engineers. Military fascine bridges were used {{on a regular basis}} by the Romans to cross obstacles. Subsequently, the use <b>of</b> <b>fascines</b> by military engineers continued almost wherever armies were deployed.|$|R

50|$|A 1955 CIA paper {{detailed}} the construction method. After {{the course of}} the railway had been surveyed, corduroy road was built over swampy ground. This was covered by layers <b>of</b> <b>fascine,</b> covered in turn by sand brought in by dump trucks. A 20 cm layer of ballast was placed on this sand, and was topped by additional sand. The railroad ties were built up on top of this. The rail line was very curvy because of the emphasis on avoiding swamps.|$|R

60|$|The Turks vied {{with the}} British in activity, making {{frequent}} night {{attacks on the}} trenches, and generally succeeding in carrying off a number <b>of</b> <b>fascines,</b> which were greatly needed, and were of special utility {{in the construction of}} the ravelin. The day after the repulse of the fourth attack the garrison suffered a heavy loss in the death of Colonel Phelypeaux, who died of fever brought on by want of rest and exposure to the sun. On the same day another, and almost as serious a loss, was sustained, for Captain Wilmot was killed by a musket shot while in the act of mounting a gun in the breach.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} the 20th that a fresh attempt to carry the place by storm was made. At this time Marlborough's {{position}} was becoming critical. The fortress held out bravely. The consumption of ammunition was so enormous, that his supplies were almost exhausted, and a great army lay directly upon his line of communication. It became a matter of necessity that the place should be taken. Immense efforts were made to secure the success of the assault. Enormous quantities <b>of</b> <b>fascines</b> were made for filling up the ditch, and 5000 British troops were sent by Marlborough from his army to lead the assault.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1733, a {{fortification}} called Fort San Andres was planned {{to replace a}} redoubt <b>of</b> <b>fascines</b> and earth, which was the only defense to Port of Spain. This however was not completed until 1787. The redoubt was located more or less where Royal Bank now stands. Port of Spain or as it was known to the Spanish, Puerto de los Hispanioles, initially was restricted to a few streets east of the St. Ann's or Tragarete River which at that time ran west along what is now Park Street and south to the foreshore through what is now Woodford Square and Chacon Street.|$|R

5|$|The {{landing at}} Juno was delayed because of choppy seas, {{and the men}} arrived ahead of their {{supporting}} armour, suffering many casualties while disembarking. Most of the offshore bombardment had missed the German defences. Several exits from the beach were created, but not without difficulty. At Mike Beach on the western flank, a large crater was filled using an abandoned AVRE tank and several rolls <b>of</b> <b>fascine,</b> which were then covered by a temporary bridge. The tank remained in place until 1972, when it was removed and restored {{by members of the}} Royal Engineers. The beach and nearby streets were clogged with traffic for most of the day, making it difficult to move inland.|$|R
6000|$|His Prussian Majesty in Camp at Philipsburg--so {{distinguished}} a volunteer, doing us {{the honor}} to encamp here--"was asked {{to all the}} Councils-of-war that were held," [...] say the Books. And he did attend, the Crown-Prince and he, on important occasions: but, alas, there was, so to speak, nothing to be consulted <b>of.</b> <b>Fascines</b> and hurdles lay useless; no {{attempt was made to}} relieve Philipsburg. On the third day after his Majesty's arrival, July 18th, Philipsburg, after a stiff defence of six weeks, growing hopeless of relief, had to surrender;--French then proceeded to repair Philipsburg, no attempt on Eugene's part to molest them there. If they try ulterior operations on this side the River, he counter-tries; and that is all.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} orders were issued, and large working parties were told off {{to go on}} with the work of {{strengthening}} the fortifications; and notice was issued that all empty hogsheads and casks in the town would be bought, by the military authorities. These were to be filled with earth, and to take the places <b>of</b> <b>fascines,</b> for which there were no materials available on the Rock. Parties of men rolled or carried these up to the heights. Other parties collected earth, and piled it to be carried up in sacks on the back of mules--there being no earth, on the rocks where the batteries would be established--a fact which added very largely to the difficulties of the Engineers.|$|R

5000|$|The fort {{initially}} held eight cannons, barracks for 100 men, two blockhouses, and {{an outer}} wall composed <b>of</b> <b>fascines,</b> sticks and sod. By 1778, the fort {{consisted of a}} more substantial blockhouse and barracks located within a palisade, {{as well as an}} abatis. A further third blockhouse was constructed at the east end of the hill, which was the continuation of a ridge formed by the St. Croix Highlands - a coastal extension of the Appalachian Mountains along the north shore of the Bay of Fundy. Upon completion of the fort the British Army named it [...] "Fort Howe", after Sir William Howe, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in America between 1775-1778. The fortification provided watch over the strategic river mouth and offered protection for surrounding rural communities from American privateers and marauding forces.|$|R

500|$|The Schellenberg heights {{dominate}} the skyline {{to the northeast}} of Donauwörth– the walled town on {{the confluence of the}} Wörnitz and Danube rivers. With one flank of the hill protected by dense, impenetrable trees of the Boschberg wood, and the river Wörnitz and marshes protecting its southern and western quarters, the Schellenberg heights offer a commanding position for any defender. However, its oval shaped summit was flat and open, and its 70-year-old defences, including an old fort built by the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus during the Thirty Years' War, were neglected and in a dilapidated state. When the unexpected attack took place the bastions, the curtain, and the ditch were fairly complete along the long eastern face from the shore of the Danube to the wooded hilltop, but in the shorter section from the wood to the fort– the angle where Marlborough's attack was delivered– the earthwork had been more hastily made up <b>of</b> <b>fascines</b> <b>of</b> brushwood thinly covered with soil. The western section of the lines ran steeply downhill from the fort to the city walls. Here, there was little to show in terms of defences, but to compensate the line could be protected by a flanking fire from the town. (See 'Schellenberg' map below.) ...|$|R
