These two supergroups rest over the Archean Bhilwara Gneissic Complex basement, which is a gneissic (high-grade metamorphism of sedimentary or igneous rocks) basement formed during the archean eon 4 Ga ago. It started as an inverted basin, that rifted and pulled apart into granitoid basement, initially during Aravalli passive rifting around 2.5 to 2.0 Ga years ago and then during Delhi active rifting around 1.9 to 1.6 Ga years ago. It started with rifting of a rigid Archaean continent banded gneissic complex around 2.2 Ga with the coexisting formation of the Bhilwara aulacogen in its eastern part and eventual rupturing and separation of the continent along a line parallel to the Rakhabdev (Rishabhdev) lineament to the west, simultaneous development of a passive continental margin with the undersea shelf rise sediments of the Aravalli-Jharol belts depositing on the attenuated crust on the eastern flank of the separated continent, subsequent destruction of the continental margin by accretion of the Delhi island arc (a type of archipelago composed of an arc-shaped chain of volcanoes closely situated parallel to a convergent boundary between two converging tectonic plates) from the west around 1.5 Ga. This tectonic plates collision event involved early thrusting with partial obduction (overthrusting of oceanic lithosphere onto continental lithosphere at a convergent plate boundary) of the oceanic crust along the Rakhabdev lineament, flattening and eventual wrenching (also called strike-slip plate fault, side ways horizontal movement of colliding plates with no vertical motion) parallel to the collision zone.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the Musgrave Province in continental reconstructions of Proterozoic Australia is only beginning to be appreciated. The Mesoproterozoic Musgrave Province sits in a geographically central location within Australia and is bounded by older and more isotopically evolved regions including the Gawler Craton of South Australia and Arunta Region of the Northern Territory. Understanding the crustal growth and deformation mechanisms involved {{in the formation of}} the Musgrave Province, and also the nature of the basement that separates these tectonic elements, allows for greater insight into defining the timing and processes responsible for the amalgamation of Proterozoic Australia. The ca. 1. 60 - 1. 54 Ga Musgravian Gneiss preserves geochemical and isotopic signatures related to ongoing arc-magmatism in an active margin between the North Australian and South Australian Cratons (NAC and SAC). Characteristic geochemical patterns of the Musgravian Gneiss include negative anomalies in Nb, Ti, and Y, and are accompanied by steep LREE patterns. Also characteristic of the Musgravian Gneiss is its juvenile Nd isotopic composition (ɛNd 1. 55 values from - 1. 2 to + 0. 9). The juvenile isotopic signature of the Musgravian Gneiss separates it from the bounding comparitively isotopically evolved terranes of the Arunta Region and Gawler Craton. The geochemical and isotopic signatures of these early Mesoproterozoic felsic rocks have similarities with island arc systems involving residual Ti-bearing minerals and garnet. Circa 1. 40 Ga metasedimentary rocks of the eastern Musgrave Province also record vital evidence for determining Australia. s location and fit within a global plate reconstruction context during the late Mesoproterozoic. U-Pb detrital zircon and Sm-Nd isotopic data from these metasedimentary rocks suggests a component of derivation from sources outside of the presently exposed Australian crust. Best fit matches come from rocks originating from eastern Laurentia. Detrital zircon ages range from Palaeoproterozoic to late Mesoproterozoic, constraining the maximum depositional age of the metasediments to approximately 1. 40 Ga, similar to that of the Belt Supergroup in western Laurentia. The 1. 49 - 1. 36 Ga detrital zircons in the Musgrave metasediments are interpreted to have been derived from the voluminous A-type suites of Laurentia, as this time period represents a “magmatic gap” in Australia, with an extreme paucity of sources this age recognized. The metasedimentary rocks exhibit a range of Nd isotopic signatures, with ɛNd(1. 4 Ga) values ranging from - 5. 1 to 0. 9, inconsistent with complete derivation from Australian sources, which are more isotopically evolved. The isotopically juvenile ca. 1. 60 - 1. 54 Ga Musgravian Gneiss is also an excellent candidate for the source of the abundant ca. 1. 6 - 1. 54 Ga detrital zircons within the lower sequences of the Belt Supergroup. If these interpretations are correct, they support a palaeogeographic reconstruction involving proximity of Australia and Laurentia during the pre-Rodinia Mesoproterozoic. This also increases the prospectivity of the eastern Musgrave Province to host a <b>metamorphised</b> equivalent of the massive Pb-Zn-Ag Sullivan deposit. The geochemical and isotopic signatures recorded in mafic-ultramafic rocks can divulge important information regarding the state of the sub continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). The voluminous cumulate mafic-ultramafic rocks of the ca. 1. 08 Ga Giles Complex record geochemical and Nd-Sr isotopic compositions consistent with an enriched parental magma. Traverses across three layered intrusions, the Kalka, Ewarara, and Gosse Pile were geochemically and isotopically analysed. Whole rock samples display variably depleted to enriched LREE patterns when normalised to chondrite ((La/Sm) N = 0. 43 - 4. 72). Clinopyroxene separates display similar depleted to enriched LREE patterns ((La/Sm) N = 0. 37 - 7. 33) relative to a chondritic source. The cumulate rocks display isotopically evolved signatures (ɛNd ~- 1. 0 to. 5. 0 and ɛSr ~ 19. 0 to 85. 0). Using simple bulk mixing and AFC equations, the Nd-Sr data of the more radiogenic samples can be modelled by addition of ~ 10 % average Musgrave crust to a primitive picritic source, without need for an enriched mantle signature. Shallow decompressional melting of an asthenospheric plume source beneath thinned Musgravian lithosphere is envisaged as a source for the parental picritic magma. A model involving early crustal contamination within feeder zones is favoured, and consequently explorers looking for Ni-Cu-Co sulphides should concentrate on locating these feeder zones. Few absolute age constraints exist for the timing of the intracratonic Petermann Orogeny of the Musgrave Province. The Petermann Orogeny is responsible for much of the lithospheric architecture we see today within the Musgrave Province, uplifting and exhuming large parts along crustal scale E-W trending fault/shear systems. Isotopic and geochemical analysis of a suite of stratigraphic units within the Neoproterozoic to Cambrian Officer Basin to the immediate south indicate the development of a foreland architecture at ca. 600 Ma. An excursion in ɛNd values towards increasingly less negative values at this time is interpreted as representing a large influx of Musgrave derived sediments. Understanding the nature of the basement separating the SAC from the NAC and WAC is vital in constructing models of the amalgamation of Proterozoic Australia. This region is poorly understood as it is overlain by the thick sedimentary cover of the Officer Basin. However, the Coompana Block is one place where basement is shallow enough to be intersected in drillcore. The previously geochronologically, geochemically, and isotopically uncharacterised granitic gneiss of the Coompana Block represents an important period of within-plate magmatism during a time of relative magmatic quiescence in the Australian Proterozoic. U-Pb LA-ICPMS dating of magmatic zircons provides an age of ca. 1. 50 Ga, interpreted as the crystallisation age of the granite protolith. The samples have distinctive A-type chemistry characterised by high contents of Zr, Nb, Y, Ga, LREE with low Mg#, Sr, CaO and HREE. ɛNd values are high with respect to surrounding exposed crust of the Musgrave Province and Gawler Craton, and range from + 1. 2 to + 3. 3 at 1. 5 Ga. The tectonic environment into which the granite was emplaced is also unclear, however one possibility is emplacement within an extensional environment represented by interlayered basalts and arenaceous sediments of the Coompana Block. Regardless, the granitic gneiss intersected in Mallabie 1 represents magmatic activity during the “Australian magmatic gap” of ca. 1. 52 - 1. 35 Ga, and is a possible source for detrital ca. 1. 50 zircons found within sedimentary rocks of Tasmania and Antarctica, and metasedimentary rocks of the eastern Musgrave Province.

Jean-François STEPHAN, professeur, Uviversité de Nice-Sophia Antipolis. Examinatrice: Mme Maria Fernanda CAMPA, professeur, Université Autonome du Guerrero. SUMMARY The {{study is}} about Sierra Madre del Sur, has {{mountain}} belt wich lining the Pacific coast, {{parallel to the}} Acapulco Trench. It is based one geological mapping of two representative areas situated in Guerrero state (the first around Olinalà, the second near the capital Chilpancingo), and one carring out transects (scale 1 / 1). Its goal is to individualize the significant geological sets and to characterize the structures related to the various stages of deformation; this in order to reconstitute {{the evolution of the}} sierra since the Jurassic inferior, by putting it within the geodynamic framework of the southern part of Mexico currently located at the crossroads of the North America plates, Caribbean and Coconuts. The first part relates to the architecture and the history of the sierra, approached by the stratigraphic and petrographic approaches and the retrotectonic structural analysis. The Jurassic pre continental – base (part of the block of Oaxaca) includes/understands a base – born of the assembly of the "terranes" Oaxaca and Mixtèque with the Paleozoic inferior – equipped locally with his sedimentary cover of the Paleozoic superior little deformed; the Xolapa Complex which levels along the coast, is a lower part of this crust, migmatized and granitized as a root of the arcs Jurassic and the Paleogene, and recently exhumed. In the whole of the Middle Jurassic, the volcanic rocks and volcanoclastic are recognized with dominant acid (Chapolapa Formation) of an arc with which the basin back-arc with Tecocoyunca is associated. Both are tectonised and <b>metamorphised</b> (green schist) by the compressive Nevadien phase of the Jurassic superior. In connection with the eustatic rise, the lower Cretaceous is marked by the marine invasion and the deposit in discordance of the neritic formations with recifs formations of the thick carbonated platform of Guerrero – Morelos. It is on the "peaceful" edge of this one that is carried out, {{at the base of the}} higher Cretaceous, the haulage of the "terrane" Guerrero (intra-oceanic arc generated during the Jurassic superior and the lower Cretaceous) by collision unintermitting – arc. A major consequence of this event is the formation, with before crown, of a basin flexural in which a powerful terrigenous series (flysch Mexcala) accumulates, during the higher Cretaceous and the Paleocene one. This basin, affected by the Laramide phase, undergoes, with the Paleocene lower – Eocene superior, a strong East-West shortening, adapted by the crumpling of the separated cover and the chipping of the base. The unmatched unit, the Paleogene and lower miocene, include/understand post-Laramide continental molasses (Formation Balsas) passing laterally and vertically to the volcanic drill plate with dominant ignimbritic generated by the subduction of the old Farallon plate; it is deformed by basic folds south-eastern – southern – north-western – north of lower Miocène. Since Miocène and following the departure of the Chortis block the evolution, still in progress, Sierra Madre del Sur is under the dependence of the subduction of the Cocos plate: it is it which induces and maintains the exhumation the lower continental crust of the block of Oaxaca (between the surface of subduction and a major surface of detachment crustal in normal fault) with update of the Complex Xolapa and deformation in antiforme of the Sierra Madre del Sur, parallel to the pit of subduction of Acapulco and thus very obliquely compared to the mesozoïc and tertiary former structures recut. The second part is initially the occasion to specify, by the placement of the pétro-geochemical tool, the geodynamic environments of the genesis of two geological sets present in the Sierra Madre del Sur and which are essential markers of the evolution of the Mexican margin: the volcanic arc Chapolapa of the Middle Jurassic whose importance has, until now, been underestimated and the higher Jurassic arc volcanic – cretaceous lower of the "terrane" Guerrero. The petrographic characteristics, the geochemistry of the major elements, the geochemistry of the elements traces and the isotopic geochemistry of the generally acid volcanic rocks of the arc Chapolapa, indicate that they are connected with the calc-alkali series of an old arc of the Andean type. They derive from the fusion of a coat asthenospheric contaminated by the fluids of the hydrothermalized paleo-pacific oceanic crust, by sediments involved in the subduction and, probably, by the North-American continental crust (block of Oaxaca) on which they rest. The volcanic rocks (acid lava and andesites of the lower Cretaceous) of the "terrane" Guerrero present in this part of the Sierra Madre del Sur are also calco-alkalin. But the geochemical indicators confirm that their context of installation was that of an insular arc the intra-Pacific These results, thereafter, are integrated in the presentation, in 2 d, of an evolutionary model of the Sierra Madre del Sur This one, built, in six stages according to the calendar established in the first part, schematizes the evolution of this building, from the Jurassic one to the current one. In the third part and on the basis of library search, a synthesis is carried out on the Jurassic components present, as in the Sierra Madre del Sur, with before "terrane" Guerrero on the old edge of the North-American continent. By finding characteristics petrologic, geochemical, stratigraphic and structural comparable, the presence of an old preliminary Nevadien chain is highlighted, from California to Honduras, even if its shifted initial continuity at summer in a sinistral way and on several hundred kilometers by transforming faults, on the one hand in the north of Mexico to the lower Jurassic – superior Crétacé, on the other hand in the south of Mexico and Guatemala since the Paleogene. This essential data is integrated in a model of palinspathic evolution of Mexico, presented since the Jurassic one in six charts. L'étude concerne la Sierra Madre del Sur, chaîne montagneuse qui borde la côte pacifique parallèlement à la fosse de subduction d'Acapulco. Elle est fondée sur la cartographie géologique de deux secteurs représentatifs situés dans l'Etat de Guerrero (l'un autour d'Olinalá, l'autre aux environs de la capitale Chilpancingo) et sur la réalisation de coupes à l'échelle 1 / 1. Son but est d'individualiser les ensembles géologiques significatifs et de caractériser les structures liées aux diverses étapes de déformation; ceci afin de reconstituer l'évolution de la sierra depuis le Jurassique inférieur, en la replaçant dans le cadre géodynamique de la partie sud du Mexique située actuellement au carrefour des plaques Amérique du Nord, Caraïbe et Cocos. La première partie concerne l'architecture et l'histoire de la sierra, abordées par les approches stratigraphiques et pétrographiques et par l'analyse structurale rétrotectonique. Le soubassement continental pré – jurassique (partie du bloc d'Oaxaca) comprend un socle – né de l'assemblage des « terranes » Oaxaca et Mixtèque au Paléozoïque inférieur – pourvu localement de sa couverture sédimentaire du Paléozoïque supérieur peu déformée; le Complexe Xolapa qui affleure le long de la côte, est une partie inférieure de cette croûte, migmatisée et granitisée en tant que racine des arcs jurassique et paléogène, et exhumée récemment. Dans l'ensemble du Jurassique moyen, sont reconnues les roches volcaniques et volcanoclastiques à dominante acide (Formation Chapolapa) d'un arc auquel est associé le bassin arrière-arc de Tecocoyunca. Les deux sont tectonisés et métamorphisés (schiste vert) par la phase compressive névadienne du Jurassique supérieur. En liaison avec la montée eustatique, le Crétacé inférieur est marqué par la transgression marine et le dépôt en discordance des formations néritiques à récifales de l'épaisse plate-forme carbonatée de Guerrero – Morelos. C'est sur le bord « pacifique » de celle-ci que s'effectue, à la base du Crétacé supérieur, le charriage du « terrane » Guerrero (arc intra-océanique engendré durant le Jurassique supérieur et le Crétacé inférieur) par collision arc – continent. Une conséquence majeure de cet événement est la formation, à l'avant du front de charriage, d'un bassin flexural dans lequel une puissante série terrigène (flysch Mexcala) s'accumule, durant le Crétacé supérieur et le Paléocène. Ce bassin, affecté par la phase laramienne, subit, au Paléocène supérieur – Eocène inférieur, un fort raccourcissement est-ouest, accomodé par le plissement de la couverture décollée et par l'écaillage du socle. L'ensemble discordant, paléogène et miocène inférieur, comprend des molasses continentales post-laramiennes (Formation Balsas) passant latéralement et verticalement au plastron volcanique à dominante ignimbritique engendré par la subduction de l'ancienne plaque Farallon; il est déformé par des plis de fond nord – nord-ouest – sud – sud-est du Miocène inférieur. Depuis le Miocène et suite au départ du bloc Chortis l'évolution, encore en cours, de la Sierra Madre del Sur est sous la dépendance de la subduction de la plaque Cocos : c'est elle qui induit et entretient l'exhumation de la croûte continentale inférieure du bloc d'Oaxaca (entre la surface de subduction et une surface majeure de détachement crustale en faille normale) avec mise à jour du Complexe de Xolapa et déformation en antiforme de la Sierra Madre del Sur, parallèlement à la fosse de subduction d'Acapulco et donc très obliquement par rapport aux structures antérieures mésozoïques et tertiaires recoupées. La deuxième partie est d'abord l'occasion de préciser, par la mise en œuvre de l'outil pétro-géochimique, les environnements géodynamiques de la genèse de deux ensembles géologiques présents dans la Sierra Madre del Sur et qui sont des marqueurs essentiels de l'évolution de la marge mexicaine: l'arc volcanique Chapolapa du Jurassique moyen dont l'importance a, jusqu'à présent, été mésestimée et l'arc volcanique jurassique supérieur – crétacé inférieur du « terrane » Guerrero. Les caractéristiques pétrographiques, la géochimie des éléments majeurs, la géochimie des éléments traces et la géochimie isotopique des roches volcaniques généralement acides de l'arc Chapolapa, indiquent qu'elles s'apparentent aux séries calco-alcalines d'un ancien arc de type andin. Elles dérivent de la fusion d'un manteau asthénosphérique contaminé par les fluides de la croûte océanique paléo-pacifique hydrothermalisée, par des sédiments entraînés dans la subduction et, vraisemblablement, par la croûte continentale nord-américaine (bloc d'Oaxaca) sur laquelle elles reposent Les roches volcaniques (laves acides et andésites du Crétacé inférieur) du « terrane » Guerrero présent dans cette partie de la Sierra Madre del Sur sont également calco-alcalines. Mais les indicateurs géochimiques confirment que leur contexte de mise en place était celui d'un arc insulaire intra-Pacifique Ces résultats sont, par la suite, intégrés dans la présentation, en 2 D, d'un modèle évolutif de la Sierra Madre del Sur. Celui-ci, construit, en six étapes selon le calendrier établi dans la première partie, schématise l'évolution de cet édifice, depuis le Jurassique jusqu'à l'actuel. Dans la troisième partie et sur la base d'une recherche bibliographique, une synthèse est réalisée sur les constituants jurassiques présents, comme dans la Sierra Madre del Sur, à l'avant du « terrane » Guerrero sur l'ancien bord du continent nord-américain. En retrouvant des caractéristiques pétrologiques, géochimiques, stratigraphiques et structurales comparables, la présence d'une ancienne chaîne liminaire névadienne est mise en évidence, depuis la Californie jusqu'au Honduras, même si sa continuité initiale à été décalée de façon sénestre et sur plusieurs centaines de kilomètres par des failles transformantes, d'une part dans le nord du Mexique au Jurassique supérieur – Crétacé inférieur, d'autre part au sud du Mexique et au Guatemala depuis le Paléogène. Cette donnée essentielle est intégrée dans un modèle d'évolution palinspathique du Mexique, présenté depuis le Jurassique en six cartes...|$|E
40|$|There {{is remarkably}} little {{research}} {{on the history of}} the Russian literary ballad or on its principal practitioner, V. A. Zhukovsky. This thesis is an attempt to rectify the situation: it follows the development of the ballad genre in Russian literature from its emergence in the 179 Os to its demise in the 1840 s. It has been decided to concentrate on the style of the ballads as the most original feature of the Russian genre, and in particular on the epithets in Zhukovsky's ballads as his most important contribution to the development of Russian poetic style. Consequently there will be no discussion of metrics, and only occasional remarks on syntax. Chapter I treats the relationship of the Russian literary ballad to the traditional folk genre, to the "ballad revival" in late eighteenth-century European literature, and to late eighteenth- century "pre-romantic" developments in Russian literature. The traditional folk ballad is defined in terms of its narrative unit, method, and attitude, and in terms of its intangible "world" or "code". Attempts by Russian collectors and critics to characterise the popular genre are also considered. Two examples of Russian folk ballads are analysed in order to demonstrate the constant features of the genre. The literary ballad is defined in terms of these same features, and its aesthetic principles are shown to be completely antithetical to those of the traditional genre. The impetus for the emergence of the Russian literary ballad was provided not by a desire to imitate the traditional genre, but rather by the Western European ballad revival. The English revival is traced froa the change in attitudes towards the folk genre as expressed by Sidney and Addison, to Prior's early literary imitation, to Percy's collection of texts, and finally to the literary ballads of Scott and Southey. Other authors which had some influence on the Russian movement (Thompson, Young, Gray, Macpherson's Ossian) are considered briefly. The German revival is similarly surveyed: Bürger's Lenore, Herder's pronouncements on folklore, and the literary ballads of Goethe, Schiller, and Uhland. The chapter concludes with a section on Russian "pre- romanticism", including anthologies of Russian superstitions, traditions, and skazki. as well as collections and imitations of folk songs and related genres - all of which influenced the development of the ballad. Chapter II, after a brief bibliography of the Russian literary ballad, examines several ballads published anonymously during the 1790 s, including two written by Anna Turchaninova, and then analyses the literary ballads of M. N. Murav'ev, N. N. Karamzin, A. F. Merzlyakov, and I. I. Dmitriev. This analysis is followed by some general conclusions on the ballads of the 179 Os. The literary ballad developed as a genre independent of folk poetry; the earliest Russian ballads were translations of English and German sources or reworkings of common European motifs. Love is the most common subject of the ballads, and the emphasis centres on the conventionally depicted characters, in particular on the psychology of the heroine. The settings are generalised, and parallels are often drawn between nature and the psychology of the characters. Attempts at local colour are minimal and unsuccessful. The structure of the ballads is relatively simple; authors frequently intrude into the action to comment on its significance. The style of the ballads of the 179 Os is characterized by emotionalism in the form of hyperbole, exclamatory and interrogative syntax, and the frequency and choice of epithets. While eighteenth-century vocabulary and syntax tend to be used for the narrative, both the setting and psychology of the characters are usually described in "pre-romantic" language. Both Karamzin's Alina (179 Os) and Merzlyakov's Milon (1797) contain a striking contrast between idyll and ballad, between classical and "pre-romantic" styles. Chapter III begins with a bibliographical sketch of biographical and critical studies on Zhukovsky, and with a note on the various editions of his work. It then examines Zhukovsky's theoretical statements about the ballad and compares them with contemporary descriptions of the genre. Both in his own opinion and in the testimony of his contemporaries, Zhukovsky was virtually identified as a balladnik. His choice of the literary ballad is attributed to the genre's popularity in Western European literature, and to the novelty of its exotic world. Zhukovsky's views on translation as expressed in his articles and letters are summarized: the translator is a creator, inspired by what he considers to be the ideal of the source, and seeking to create an effect on the reader equivalent to that produced by the original. As an example of this theory put into practice, Zhukovsky's ballad Rybak (1818) is compared with its source, Goethe's Der Fischer (1778). The sources of Zhukovsky's forty literary ballads are then enumerated, after which eight representative ballads are examined with reference to their subject, characters, setting, theme, and style. Lyudmila (18 O 8) established the pattern for Zhukovsky's ballads and introduced Bürger's theme into Russian literature; Svetlana (18 O 8 - 12) was written as a parody of Lyudmila; in Adel'stan (1813) Southey's ballad was given an original conclusion and a setting which became typical for all Zhukcvsky's ballads; in Ivikovy zhuravli (1813) Zhukovsky transformed Schiller's classical theme and created a mood of profound suspense; Eolova arfa (1814) combined the poet's favourite verbal motifs of youth, silence, and despondency; Gromoboi and Vadim (Dvenadtsat' spyashchikh dev) (1810 - 17) were written as a great parable of suffering and remorse, aspiration and fulfilment; finally, in Zamok Smal'gol'm (1822) Zhukovsky turned Scott's imitation of a popular ballad into a successful literary ballad. Throughout his career Zhukovsky never altered his choice of sources, his method of transforming European themes, or his individual Russian style. While the events of the original ballad source were usually retained in outline form, the characters were <b>metamorphised</b> into romantic heroes and heroines, whose speech was identical with that of the narrator. The settings were generalised and details of local colour were eliminated or Russianized. Zhukovsky's real theme always remained the same: his own experience of melancholy, anxiety, despair, love, fear, or resignation. The style which expressed this theme was always "literary": its originality resided in the alternating intonations, in the negative constructions, in the syntactical parallelism, and, more significantly, in the frequency, choice, and meaning of his epithets. In Chapter IV the epithets in Zhukovsky's ballads are studied. It begins with a summary of previous definitions of the epithet from Quintilian to the Russian Formalists. A definition is accepted which includes all purely descriptive words under the term "epithet", and allows for a distinction in usage or function. A. V. Isachenko's grammatical classification of adjectival epithets is adopted. After an evaluation of previous {{research on the}} epithet in Russian folk poetry, in English and German literary ballads, and in eighteenth-century Russian poetry, the following conclusions are drawn: firstly, there is little variety and no complexity in the epithets of Russian folk ballads - indeed, the range and use of the epithet is very limited; secondly, epithets in folk ballads differ fundamentally from those in literary ballads: the concrete, unambiguous epithets of the former are replaced in the latter by emotional, connotative epithets; thirdly, from its relatively insignificant role in the classical style of Lomonosov and Sumarokov, the epithet increases in importance in Russian poetry during the late eighteenth century. Murav'ev's language reflects the transition from objectivity to subjectivity, a trend which is continued by Karamzin and reaches its culmination in the poetry of Zhukovsky. Previous studies of Zhukovsky's epithets by G. A. Gukovsky and V. P. Petushkov are evaluated, and the results of a comprehensive examination of the sources and meanings of Zhukovsky's epithets are presented. There is no evidence to indicate any substantive relationship between the epithet in folk ballads and in Zhukovsky*s literary ballads. In comparison with the epithet in English and German ballads, Zhukovsky's epithets are more frequent, have their primary source in his own imagination, have fewer synonyms, and in their total subjectivity differ substantially in meaning. Zhukovsky's poetry undoubtedly emerges from the poetic practice of the eighteenth century; moreover his style was much influenced by late eighteenth-century developments. The originality of Zhukovsky's epithets lies firstly in their total subjectivity: they are employed not so much to describe objects and concepts, but rather to convey the poet's subjective impressions about these objects and concepts; and secondly, in the complex interrelationship between the applicability and indeterminateness of the epithets: as the applicability of an epithet increases, its meaning becomes more indeterminate; as the meaning becomes more indeterminate, so the applicability of the epithet increases. Zhukovsky's epithets created the foundation for the vocabulary of Russian romantic poetry. Therein lies his greatest contribution to the development of Russian poetic style. <p. Chapter V treats the polemics in Russian criticism from 1815 to 1825 which surrounded the literary ballad. It begins with the polemic in verse (Batyushkov and Voeikov) and in comedy (Shakhovskoi, Zagoskin, and a joint work by Griboedov and Katenin); it then considers the dispute over Zhukovsky's Lyudmla and Katenin's Ol'ga in 1816; next it traces the gradual shift in attitudes from praise to criticism of the ballad genre and of its creator, and analyzes the attacks made on the genre in 1818, on Zhukovsky's imitators in 182 O, and on Zhukovsky's ballad Rybak in 1821. All of these polemics help to clarify the nature of Zhukovsky's innovations in the language of Russian poetry, and confirm that it is in the meaning and applicability of his epithets that his greatest originality resides. The chapter concludes with some remarks on the relationship between Pushkin and Zhukovsky, and with a consideration of Polevoi's and Belinsky's attempts to assign Zhukovsky and the ballad genre their rightful places in the development of Russian literature. In Chapter VI representative ballads by P. A. Katenin, A. I. Meshchevsky, and I. I. Kozlov are examined. Katenin was considered by contemporary critics as Zhukovsky's "opponent", and his ballads were said to be based on different stylistic principles. In fact, Katenin's contribution to the genre is shown to be ambiguous. While in Pevets (1814), Natasha (1814) and Pevets Uslad (1817) Zhukovsky's influence predominates, in Ubiitsa (1815), Leshii (1815), and Ol'ga (1816) Katenin was attempting to develop a new, more "popular" genre. Meshchevsky, an almost forgotten poet, has recently been discovered and labelled Zhukovsky's "double"; an analysis of his only two published ballads shows that while he imitated Zhukovsky's intonations, interrupted narrative, and epithets, his highly artificial images and complicated syntax tended to obscure his meaning. The ballads of Kozlov, Zhukovsky's most devoted disciple, are noteworthy for the originality of their narrative structure; but both their subjects and their style axe derived largely from Zhukovsky's ballads. Chapter VII treats Pushkin's literary ballads. It begins with a consideration of his early imitations of the subject, setting, characters, and style of Zhukovsky's ballads; Osgar (1814) an original poem based on an Ossianic theme, the early poslaniya, and several balladic lyrics are used to demonstrate in one way or another the influence of Zhukovsky's poetry. Next the chapter examines those works in which Pushkin parodied precisely those elements of Zhukovsky's ballads which he had previously imitated: Ten' Barkova (1814 ?), an unpublished pornographic parody of Gromoboi; Ruslan i Lyudmila (1817 - 2 O), the fourth canto of which is a reworking of Vadim; and the balladic motifs in Tat'yana's dream in Onegin and in two of the Povesti Belkina. Finally Pushkin's original ballads are analyzed, and each is seen to be in some sense a "model": Rusalka (1819) is a reinterpretation of the nature-magic theme; Zhenikh (1825) synthesizes a German source and Russian folkloric motifs; Utoplennik (1828) places a popular motif and colloquial speech within the framework of sophisticated narration; Voron k voronu letit (1828) imitates the simplicity and unemotional realism of the traditional folk genre; and Besy (1830) is an exercise in the evocation of mood and the transformation of a ballad into a personal lyric. In his literary ballads Pushkin succeeded, where Zhukovsky had failed, in approaching the narrative unit, method, attitude, and "world" characteristic of the folk ballads. Chapter VIII examines Lermontov's literary ballads. It begins with his earliest experiments based on German and English sources, including two ballads entitled Gost' written in the early 1830 s. Both the choice of models for imitation and the style of his early works reflect the strong influence of Zhukovsky's ballads. These experiments were followed by a series of parodies on the ballad genre and its practitioners: Nezabudka (183 O), a comic reworking of Schiller's Der Taucher: On byl v krayu svyatom (1832), a parody of Zhukovsky's Staryi rytsar' (183 O); and Yugel'skii baron (1837), a parody of Zhukovsky's Zamok Smal'gol'm. Beginning with his ballad cycle of 1832 (Trostnik, Rusalka, Ballada - Kuda tak provorno), Leratontov began to use the genre in a creative and individual way. In Tri pal'my (1 S 39) he reinterprets the theme of Pushkin's Podrazhanie Koranu IX. and introduces rich visual and aural imagery; in Dary Tereka (1839) he combines folk elements with literary motifs; in Spor (1841) the theme of man's destruction of natural beauty is presented in a series of vivid visual images; Tamara (1841), Lermontov's most original literary ballad, is another reworking of the nature-magic theme of Zhukovsky's Rybak and Pushkin's Rusalka: finally, Morskaya tsarevna (1841) is a reworking of Lermontov's own earlier Rusalka, with an engaging narrative and meaningful theme. Lermontov's literary ballads are neither "models" in the sense that Pushkin's are, nor do they approach the characteristics of the traditional folk genre: for Lermontov the literary ballad was merely one of the available lyrical forms, not the most fashioniable genre in Russian poetry. The conclusion includes a brief survey of the Russian literary ballad from the death of Lermontov to the Soviet period and the suggestion that any future history of the European ballad revival should consider other Slavonic literatures, in particular, the ballads of Mickiewicz, Shevchenko, and Erben. The appendixes include materials on the epithet in Russian folk ballads and in English and German literary ballads; on the epithet in Zhukovsky's ballads; on the epithet in Zhukovsky's ballad manuscripts; and on Zhukovsky's editions of Murav'ev and Kamenev. </p...|$|E
