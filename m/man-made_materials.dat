5|$|Further {{refinements}} in the process, such {{as basic}} oxygen steelmaking (BOS), largely replaced earlier methods by further lowering the cost of production and increasing {{the quality of the}} final product. Today, steel {{is one of the most}} common <b>man-made</b> <b>materials</b> in the world, with more than 1.6 billion tons produced annually. Modern steel is generally identified by various grades defined by assorted standards organizations.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian army {{units were}} skiing for sport (and prizes) in the 18th century. Starting {{in the latter}} part of the 20th century, {{technique}} evolved from the striding in-track classic technique to include skate-skiing, which occurs on courses that have been groomed with wide lanes for those using the technique. At the same time, equipment evolved from skis and poles that were made of wood and other natural materials to comprising such <b>man-made</b> <b>materials</b> as fiberglass, carbon fiber, and polyethylene plastics.|$|E
5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about). The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future <b>man-made</b> <b>materials</b> would be used almost exclusively.|$|E

25|$|Historically, woodworkers {{relied upon}} the woods native to their region, until {{transportation}} and trade innovations made more exotic woods {{available to the}} craftsman. Woods are typically sorted into three basic types: hardwoods typified by tight grain and derived from broadleaf trees, softwoods from coniferous trees, and <b>man-made</b> <b>materials</b> such as plywood and MDF.|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, the {{commission}} members shared {{a belief that}} the buildings should not reinterpret past architectural forms – as had been done at earlier fairs, such as Chicago's 1893 World's Columbian Exposition—but should instead reflect new, modern ideas, as well as suggest future architectural developments. Because the fairgrounds was on new man-made land that was owned by the state and not the city, the land was initially free from Chicago's strict building codes, which allowed the architects to explore new materials and building techniques. This allowed the design and construction of a wide array of experimental buildings, that eventually included large general exhibition halls, such as the Hall of Science (Paul Cret) and the U.S. Federal Building (Bennet, Burnham and Holabird); corporate pavilions, including the General Motors Building (Albert Kahn) and the Sears Pavilion (Nimmons, Carr, and Wright); futuristic model houses, most popular was the twelve-sided House of Tomorrow (George Frederick Keck); as well as progressive foreign pavilions,including the Italian Pavilion (Mario de Renzi and Adalberto Libera); and historic and ethnic entertainment venues, such as the Belgian Village (Burnham Brothers with Alfons deRydt) and the Streets of Paris (Andrew Rebori and John W. Root) where fan dancer Sally Rand performed. These buildings were constructed out of five-ply Douglas fir plywood, ribbed-metal siding, and prefabricated, boards, such as Masonite, Sheetrock, Maizewood, as well as other new <b>man-made</b> <b>materials.</b> Structural advances also filled the fairgrounds. These included the earliest catenary roof constructed in the United States, which roofed the dome of the Travel and Transport Building (Bennet, Burnham and Holabird) and the first thin shell concrete roof in the United States, on the small, multi-vaulted Brook Hill Farm Dairy built for the 1934 season of the fair.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the small}} colony sizes, P. alternata have limited {{capability}} to defend the nests. Thus, the Black hover wasp construct nests {{in such a way}} to blend in with the forest vegetation. The camouflaged nests help reduce predation by serving as the major line of defense. The foundress responsible for making the nest searches for the materials and builds the nest, though some have already been built. The two major types of nests are the hanging nests and the flat-topped nests. [...] The hanging nests are slender in shape in comparison to the flat-topped nests that are more stout and oval-shaped. The hanging nests provide a protective screen that potentially block predators. P. alternata utilize both organic and inorganic materials. The inorganic materials vary based on region but demonstrates the use of <b>man-made</b> <b>materials.</b> The organic composite materials of the nests include a mixture of mud, sand, and plant hairs. These materials contribute to the pale brown color of the nests allowing them to blend in with surrounding trees and plants.|$|E

50|$|Portland cement was {{developed}} in Northfleet, Kent, by William Aspdin, son of Joseph Aspdin. The development was to heat the ingredients to around 1450C, producing clinker. Previously temperatures were taken to only 800C, which was not enough. The first ever cement kiln is still in Northfleet today in a cardboard factory. In the late 1800s, the rotary kiln made the process much more efficient. Concrete, effectively man-made stone, is the most widespread <b>man-made</b> <b>material.</b> 5% of all carbon emissions worldwide are from concrete production.|$|R
