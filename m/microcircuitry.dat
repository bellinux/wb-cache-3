40|$|We here {{investigated}} {{inhibitory synapse}} turnover {{in the adult}} brain using the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus where new synapses form during different physiological conditions, in particular on oxytocin neurons largely controlled by GABAergic inputs and locally released oxytocin. Patch clamp recordings and ultrastructural analysis of the nucleus in acute slices from late gestating rats showed that oxytocin and estrogen promoted rapid formation of inhibitory synapses. Thus, after 2 -h exposure {{to a combination of}} oxytocin and 17 -β estradiol, the frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents was significantly enhanced. Since their amplitude and presynaptic GABA release probability were unmodified, this indicated an increased number of synapses. Electron microscopy confirmed increased densities of symmetric, putative GABAergic synapses within 2 -h exposure to the peptide or steroid, effects which were reversible and oxytocin receptor mediated. Our observations thus offer direct evidence that hypothalamic GABAergic <b>microcircuitries</b> can undergo rapid and functional remodeling under changing neuroendocrine conditions. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Neurological {{diseases}} {{associated with}} neuronal death are also accompanied by axonal denervation of connected brain regions. In these areas, denervation {{leads to a}} decrease in afferent drive, which may in turn trigger active central nervous system (CNS) circuitry rearrangement. This rewiring process is important therapeutically, since it can partially recover functions and can be further enhanced using modern rehabilitation strategies. Nevertheless, the cellular mechanisms of brain rewiring are not fully understood. We recently reported a mechanism by which neurons remodel their local connectivity under conditions of network-perturbance: hippocampal pyramidal cells can extend spine head protrusions (SHPs), which reach out toward neighboring terminals and form new synapses. Since this form of activity-dependent rewiring is observed only on some spines, we investigated the required conditions. We speculated, that the actin-associated protein synaptopodin, which is involved in several synaptic plasticity mechanisms, could {{play a role in}} the formation and/or stabilization of SHPs. Using hippocampal slice cultures, we found that ~ 70 % of spines with protrusions in CA 1 pyramidal neurons contained synaptopodin. Analysis of synaptopodin-deficient neurons revealed that synaptopodin is required for the stability but not the formation of SHPs. The effects of synaptopodin could be linked to its role in Ca(2 +) homeostasis, since spines with protrusions often contained ryanodine receptors and synaptopodin. Furthermore, disrupting Ca(2 +) signaling shortened protrusion lifetime. By transgenically reintroducing synaptopodin on a synaptopodin-deficient background, SHP stability could be rescued. Overall, we show that synaptopodin increases the stability of SHPs, and could potentially modulate the rewiring of <b>microcircuitries</b> by making synaptic reorganization more efficient...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{benefits}} of using viral tracers is the ability of the virus to jump across synapses. This allows for tracing of <b>microcircuitry</b> as well as projection studies. Few molecular tracers are able to do this, and those that can usually have a decreased signal in secondary neurons. Therefore, another benefit of viral tracing is the ability of viruses to self-replicate. As soon as the secondary neuron is infected, the virus begins multiplying and replicating. There is no loss of signal as the tracer propagates through the brain.|$|E

50|$|Neuroconstructivism {{has arisen}} {{as a direct}} {{rebuttal}} against psychologists who argue for an innate modularity of the brain. Modularity of the brain would require a pre-specified pattern of synaptic connectivity within the cortical <b>microcircuitry</b> of a specific neural system. Instead, Annette Karmiloff-Smith {{has suggested that the}} microconnectivity of the brain emerges from the gradual process of ontogenetic development. Proponents of the modular theory might have been misled by the seemingly normal performances of individuals who exhibit a learning disability on tests. While it may appear that cognitive functioning may be impaired in only specified areas, this may be a functional flaw in the test. Many standardized tasks used to assess the extent of damage within the brain do not measure underlying causes, instead only showing the static end-state of complex processes. An alternative explanation to account for these normal test scores would be the ability of the individual to compensate using other brain regions that are not normally used for such a task. Such compensation could only have resulted from developmental neuroplasticity and the interaction between environment and brain functioning.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} layers to the {{cerebellar}} cortex; from outer to inner layer, {{these are the}} molecular, Purkinje, and granular layers. The function of the cerebellar cortex is essentially to modulate information flowing through the deep nuclei. The <b>microcircuitry</b> of the cerebellum is schematized in Figure 5. Mossy and climbing fibers carry sensorimotor information into the deep nuclei, which in turn {{pass it on to}} various premotor areas, thus regulating the gain and timing of motor actions. Mossy and climbing fibers also feed this information into the cerebellar cortex, which performs various computations, resulting in the regulation of Purkinje cell firing. Purkinje neurons feed back into the deep nuclei via a potent inhibitory synapse. This synapse regulates the extent to which mossy and climbing fibers activate the deep nuclei, and thus control the ultimate effect of the cerebellum on motor function. The synaptic strength of almost every synapse in the cerebellar cortex has been shown to undergo synaptic plasticity. This allows the circuitry of the cerebellar cortex to continuously adjust and fine-tune the output of the cerebellum, forming the basis of some types of motor learning and coordination. Each layer in the cerebellar cortex contains the various cell types that comprise this circuitry.|$|E
5000|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the length of the critical period may be linked to differential gene expression within song nuclei, thought to be caused by neurotransmitter binding of receptors during neural activation. One key area is the LMAN song nucleus, part of the specialized cortical-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop in the anterior forebrain pathway, which is essential for vocal plasticity. While inducing deafness in songbirds usually disrupts the sensory phase of learning and leads to production of highly abnormal song structures, lesioning of LMAN in zebra finches prevents this song deterioration, leading to the earlier development of stable song. One of the neurotransmitter receptors shown to affect LMAN is the N- methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR), which is required for learning and activity-dependent gene regulation in the post-synaptic neuron. Infusions of the NMDAR antagonist APV (R-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate) into the LMAN song nucleus disrupts the critical period in the zebra finch.NMDAR density and mRNA levels of the NR1 subunit also decrease in LMAN during early song development. When the song becomes crystallized, expression of the NR2B subunit decreases in LMAN and NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents shorten. [...] It has been hypothesized that LMAN actively maintains RA <b>microcircuitry</b> in a state permissive for song plasticity and in a process of normal development it regulates HVC-RA synapses.|$|E
50|$|Most neuroanatomists {{would agree}} that {{understanding}} how the brain is connected to itself and the body is of paramount importance. As such, it is of equal importance to {{have a way to}} visualize and study the connections among neurons. Neuronal tracing methods offer an unprecedented view into the morphology and connectivity of neural networks. Depending on the tracer used, this can be limited to a single neuron or can progress trans-synaptically to adjacent neurons. After the tracer has spread sufficiently, the extent may be measured either by fluorescence (for dyes) or by immunohistochemistry (for biological tracers).An important innovation in this field is the use of neurotropic viruses as tracers. These not only spread throughout the initial site of infection, but can jump across synapses. The use of a virus provides a self-replicating tracer. This can allow for the elucidation of neural <b>microcircuitry</b> to an extent that was previously unobtainable. This has significant implications for the real world. If we can better understand what parts of the brain are intimately connected, we can predict the effect of localized brain injury. For example, if a patient has a stroke in the amygdala, primarily responsible for emotion, the patient might also have trouble learning to perform certain tasks because the amygdala is highly interconnected with the orbitofrontal cortex, responsible for reward learning. As always, the first step to solving a problem is fully understanding it, so if we are to have any hope of fixing brain injury, we must first understand its extent and complexity.|$|E
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of viruses, such as those used in {{neuronal}} tracing, is different from cellular organisms. Viruses are parasitic in nature and cannot proliferate on their own. Therefore, they must infect another organism and effectively hijack cellular machinery to complete their life cycle. The first stage of the viral life cycle is called viral entry. This defines {{the manner in which}} a virus infects a new host cell. In nature, neurotropic viruses are usually transmitted through bites or scratches, {{as in the case of}} Rabies virus or certain strains of Herpesviruses. In tracing studies, this step occurs artificially, typically through the use of a syringe. The next stage of the viral life cycle is called viral replication. During this stage, the virus takes over the host cell's machinery to cause the cell to create more viral proteins and assemble more viruses. Once the cell has produced a sufficient number of viruses, the virus enters the viral shedding stage. During this stage, viruses leave the original host cell in search of a new host. In the case of neurotropic viruses, this transmission typically occurs at the synapse. Viruses can jump across the relatively short space from one neuron to the next. This trait is what makes viruses so useful in tracer studies. Once the virus enters the next cell, the cycle begins anew. The original host cell begins to degrade after the shedding stage. In tracer studies, this is the reason the timing must be tightly controlled. If the virus is allowed to spread too far, the original <b>microcircuitry</b> of interest is degraded and no useful information can be retrieved. Typically, viruses can infect only a small number of organisms, and even then only a specific cell type within the body. The specificity of a particular virus for a specific tissue is known as its tropism. Viruses in tracer studies are all neurotropic (capable of infecting neurons).|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>microcircuitry</b> (the connectivity {{at the level}} of individual neuronal processes and synapses), which is indispensable for our understanding of brain function, is based on serial transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or one of its modern variants. Due to technical limitations, most previous studies that used serial TEM recorded relatively small stacks of individual neurons. As a result, our knowledge of <b>microcircuitry</b> in any nervous system is very limited.

40|$|Existing {{knowledge}} of the cerebellar <b>microcircuitry</b> structure and physiology allows a rather detailed description of what it in itself can and cannot do.

In fact, as described in this review, the major factor that hampers further progress in understanding cerebellar function is the limited insights into the circuitry-level function of the targeted motor output systems and the nature of the information in the mossy fiber afferents. The cerebellar circuitry in itself is here summarized as a gigantic associative memory element, primarily consisting of the parallel fiber synapses, whereas most other circuitry components, including the climbing fiber system, primarily has the role of maintaining activity balance in the intracerebellar and extracerebellar circuitry.
