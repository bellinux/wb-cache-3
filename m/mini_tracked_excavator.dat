40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} {{we intend to}} make a noise monitoring, {{produced}} by band conveyors, monitorization necessary for finding solutions to reduce noise. The main sources of noise pollution are: <b>tracked</b> <b>excavators</b> with rotor and band conveyors. For the urban areas and forested areas the <b>tracked</b> <b>excavators</b> with rotor is not a source of noise pollution. They represent a source of noise just inside the career, {{because of the way}} adjacent extraction steps, which is a natural barrier against the propagation of noise. The band conveyor T 111 from the Mining Unit of Career Rosia, which is transporting excavated material represents a source of noise pollution for residents of the village of Rosia of Jiu due to he`s close location. Exposure to noise for long-term can cause adverse effects on health...|$|R
5000|$|Excavators {{are also}} called diggers, JCBs (a {{proprietary}} name, in {{an example of}} a generic trademark), mechanical shovels, or 360-degree excavators (sometimes abbreviated simply to 360). <b>Tracked</b> <b>excavators</b> are sometimes called [...] "trackhoes" [...] by analogy to the backhoe. In the UK, wheeled excavators are sometimes known as [...] "rubber ducks." ...|$|R
50|$|Their {{relatively}} small frame and precise control make backhoe-loaders very useful and common in urban engineering {{projects such as}} construction and repairs in areas too small for larger equipment. Their versatility and compact size makes them {{one of the most}} popular urban construction vehicles. For larger projects, a <b>tracked</b> <b>excavator</b> is generally used.|$|R
50|$|There is a <b>mini</b> <b>track</b> for {{children}} {{where they can}} drive small electric cars {{in the form of}} Volkswagen Beetles.|$|R
50|$|Because digging {{while on}} tires {{intrinsically}} causes {{the machine to}} rock, and the swinging weight of the backhoe could cause the vehicle to tip, most backhoe loaders use hydraulic outriggers or stabilizers at the rear when digging and lower the loader bucket for additional stability. This means that the bucket must be raised and the outriggers retracted when the vehicle needs to change positions, reducing efficiency. For this reason many companies offer miniature <b>tracked</b> <b>excavators,</b> which sacrifice the loader function and ability to be driven from site to site, for increased digging efficiency.|$|R
50|$|In {{plantation}} {{forests in}} parts of Europe, the tree stumps left after felling are now sometimes {{pulled out of the}} ground to supply wood fuel for biomass power stations. The stump is the base of the trunk and the attached woody roots. Tree stumps and roots are extracted using a hydraulic head on a <b>tracked</b> <b>excavator</b> or with a mechanical head equipped by a special tool for tractors. Stump harvesting is expected to provide an increasing component of the woody material required by the woody biomass power sector in Europe.|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on a cost calculation for the operation of construction machine. Because this group is a signifiant volume of the total costs, and it affects not only the amount of profit but also the overall cost production, {{it is important to}} track these costs, especially in the construction companies that carry out the ground works or construction of roads. The next section carried out a calculation of prices of construction work, as well as a determination of rental billing rate of the equipment.

The two harvesters simulated were a modified John Deere 988 <b>tracked</b> <b>excavator</b> with a model RP 1600 single grip sawhead and an excavator based Timbco 425 with an ultimate 5600 single grip sawhead. The forwarder used in the simulations was a Valmet 524 with &foot log bunks. Production rates and costs were simulated {{for a range of}} stand conditions. The results should be valuable to managers, planners, and loggers considering the use of CTL and forwarding systems in the region...|$|R

40|$|Bringing into {{commercial}} {{circulation of}} <b>tracked</b> <b>excavators</b> is uniformly regulated in the States of the European Union {{according to the}} European Directive 84 / 532 /EEC. The sound power level L_W_A in dB to be determined {{within the scope of}} the EU-Type Examination for the conveyor of soil proper and the sound pressure level L_n_A are regulated by the EU-Directives 86 / 662 /EEC and 89 / 514 /EEC. The present limit values for the sound power level L_W_A= 106 dB to 113 dB dependend on the performance are the basic precondition for the participation in the free movement of goods within the EU-States. These limit values do not always meet the present state of the sound insulation technology. The Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) has extended to awarding catalogue for the eco-label 'Blauer Engel RAL-UZ 53 '' for low-noise building machines and devices by the category of the excavators of high capacity (P_N> 85 kW). The present report shows that it is possible from the economic and technical aspect to introduce on the market of the EU states <b>tracked</b> <b>excavators</b> of the 40 tons category with a sound power level L_W_A= 101 dB and with a sound pressure level L_p_A= 71 dB at the operator's place at the dynamic working cycle according to the EU-Direktive 89 / 514 /EEC. In this connection sound insulation measures were carried out at the source of relatively low-noise driving motors and passive sound insulation measures (exhaust emission air inlet silencers, optimized silencers, full encasing/partial encasing).

5000|$|A {{geologic}} {{preliminary investigation}} is {{a survey of}} the subsoil conducted by an engineering geologist in conjunction with a civil engineer. Typically, the footprint of the structure is established on the proposed building site and trenches up to fourteen feet deep are dug both outside, and more importantly, inside, the proposed footprint using the bucket-end of a backhoe. In extreme cases, a larger, more powerful <b>tracked</b> <b>excavator</b> is used. The geologist is looking for potential failure planes, expansive clays, excessive moisture, potential for proper compaction, and other variables that go into the construction of a solid foundation (such as potential for liquefaction). Materials are also gathered to determine the maximum compaction value (a [...] "proctor") of the subsurface. Prelims should always be conducted prior to the construction of any permanent structure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{excavator}} {{is based}} on a 2008 Liebherr 984 that was heavily modified by Kocurek Excavators Ltd for the Birmingham-based demolition Coleman & Company. It was bought for around NZ$4m and imported to New Zealand by Auckland-based demolition firm Nikau Contractors, and arrived in the Port of Lyttelton in September 2011. [...] The <b>tracked</b> <b>excavator</b> weighs 208 t and has a maximum reach of 65 m. When the articulated arm is not extended, the reach is 25 m. The excavator is not suited for demolishing the bottom two storeys of a building. At full reach, a 2.5 t demolition attachment can be fitted to the hydraulic boom. At 40 m reach, the machine can handle a 6 t concrete breaker. The excavator got its nickname following a naming competition on Christchurch radio station More FM.|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} that predicts {{the total cost}} of plant maintenance (i. e. direct cost of maintenance plus indirect cost of lost production) and is derived studying a random sample of <b>tracked</b> hydraulic <b>excavators.</b> Analysis is based on the machine history file data of 33 plant items, modelled using multiple regression (MR) analysis. Validation of the model was determined via the combination of an observed high R 2 at 0. 94 and various statistical tests which confirmed the prerequisites of a rigorous MR analysis. Machine weight, type of industry and company attitude towards predictive maintenance were found to be the best predictor variables of total plant maintenance cost. The paper also discusses reasons underlying the inclusion of predictor variables in the final model, and concludes with clear directions for future research in this field.
