5|$|Apple {{approached}} Sony in late 1989 {{because it}} did not have enough engineers to handle the number of new products that were planned for delivery in 1991. Using a basic blueprint from Apple, including a list of chips and other components, and the Portable's architecture, the 100 was <b>miniaturized</b> and manufactured by Sony in San Diego, California, and Japan. Sony engineers had little experience building personal computers but nonetheless completed Apple's smallest and lightest machine in under 13months, cancelling other projects and giving the PowerBook100 top priority. Sony president Norio Ohga gave project manager Kihey Yamamoto permission to recruit engineers from any Sony division.|$|E
5|$|Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) was an American {{electronics}} company {{founded in}} Albuquerque, New Mexico that began manufacturing electronic calculators in 1971 and personal computers in 1975. Ed Roberts and Forrest Mims founded MITS in December 1969 to produce <b>miniaturized</b> telemetry modules for model rockets {{such as a}} roll rate sensor. In 1971, Roberts redirected the company into the electronic calculator market and the MITS 816 desktop calculator kit was featured on the November 1971 cover of Popular Electronics. The calculators were very successful and sales topped one million dollars in 1973. A brutal calculator price war left the company deeply in debt by 1974.|$|E

In February 2014, Roland announced the TR-8 drum machine, which recreates the 808 and 909 {{through a combination of}} modeling and sampling. In August 2017, Roland announced the TR-08, a <b>miniaturized</b> 808 reissue with features including an LED display, MIDI and USB connections, expanded sequencer control, and a built-in speaker.|$|E

The load transfer efficiency is improved if the rigidity of the leaf spring in the vertical direction is low. However, it is difficult to <b>miniaturize</b> the leaf spring further using conventional machining processes.

5|$|The Adventures of Mini-Goddess, or, when {{literally}} {{translated from}} its original Japanese title, Ah! My Goddess: Being Small is Convenient, is a Japanese animated TV series and that had 48 episodes aired during its run from 1998 to 1999. It was directed by Hiroko Kazui and Yasuhiro Matsumura and was produced by Oriental Light and Magic. It premiered {{as a part of}} the omnibus show Anime Complex on WOWOW. In Region 1, it was licensed to and distributed by Geneon Entertainment, formerly known as Pioneer Entertainment.

5|$|In 1993, Anime International Company {{produced}} a five-episode OVA series {{based on the}} manga series. Its success inspired a spinoff TV series entitled The Adventures of Mini-Goddess. Produced by Oriental Light and Magic and initially aired on WOWOW in 1998 and 1999, the plot revolved around the adventures of three <b>miniaturized</b> goddesses and their rat companion Gan-chan, all of whom live in a temple home. In 2005, Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) began broadcasting Ah! My Goddess, a new series directed by Hiroaki Gōda and animated by Anime International Company. It ran for 24 episodes between January 7 and July 8, 2005. A sequel also animated by Anime International Company and directed by Gōda, Ah! My Goddess: Flights of Fancy, aired on TBS between April 6 and September 14, 2006. A two-episode special entitled Ah!

5|$|Potter biographer Linda Lear {{notes that}} none of the rabbit books {{subsequent}} to Peter Rabbit appealed to Potter with the passion she experienced for the original, but, in Benjamin Bunny, she successfully wrote a simple, didactic tale for very young children that was less complicated than The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin and The Tailor of Gloucester. Benjamin Bunny however lacked the vitality of her previous efforts because it was made to order rather than allowed to flower from a picture letter to real children in the manner of Peter Rabbit and Squirrel Nutkin. The weak story line of Benjamin Bunny is evidence of her dwindling interest in continuing the Peter Rabbit saga, but the book displays a delight in place, a deep understanding of rabbit anatomy and behaviour, and beautifully <b>miniaturized</b> illustrations of vegetable gardens. Benjamin Bunny presented demands upon Potter she had not encountered in her previous three tales. She had depleted all her sketchbook backgrounds in the production of the other tales and was forced to create new ones, but the greatest challenge to Potter's artistry was consciously working to satisfy both her publisher's demand for another commercial success and her public's expectation of a tale as delightful as her others while labouring under the pressure to produce a sequel to a work of genius.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Smart phones, gaming consoles, and {{wireless}} routers are ubiquitous; the increasing diffusion of such devices with limited resources, together with society’s unsatiated appetite for new applications, pushes companies to <b>miniaturize</b> their programs. <b>Miniaturizing</b> {{a program for}} a hand-held device is a time-consuming task often requiring complex decisions. Companies must accommodate conflicting constraints: customers’ satisfaction with features may be in conflict with a device’s limited storage, memory, or battery life. This paper proposes a process, MoMS, for the multi-objective miniaturization of software to help developers <b>miniaturize</b> programs while satisfying multiple conflicting constraints. It {{can be used to}} support the reverse engineering, next release problem, and porting of both software and product lines. The process directs the elicitation of customer pre-requirements, their mapping to program features, and the selection of the features to port. We present two case studies based on Pooka, an email client, and SIP Communicator, an instant messenger, to demonstrate that MoMS supports optimized miniaturization and helps reduce effort by 77 %, on average, over a manual approach.
