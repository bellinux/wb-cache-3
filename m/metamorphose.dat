5|$|Adult frogs {{lay their}} eggs in moist places, {{including}} on leaves, in plants, among exposed roots, and elsewhere. Once the eggs hatch, the adult piggybacks the tadpoles, one at a time, to suitable water, either a pool, or the water gathered in the throat of bromeliads or other plants. The tadpoles remain there until they <b>metamorphose,</b> fed by unfertilized eggs laid at regular intervals by the mother.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoan larvae {{either have}} large yolks or {{are capable of}} feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding {{capabilities}} extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and <b>metamorphose</b> into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.|$|E
5|$|In eastern Serbia it was {{believed}} that ale who interact with people can <b>metamorphose</b> into humans or animals, after which their true selves can be seen only by so-called šestaci– men with six fingers on both hands and six toes on both feet– though human-looking ale cause houses to shake when they enter. By a belief recorded in the Homolje region, ale that charge to the Moon also display shapeshifting abilities: they repeatedly shift from their basic shape of two-headed snakes to six-fingered men who hold iron pitchforks, black young bulls, big boars, or black wolves, and back.|$|E

40|$|Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is {{a fungus}} infecting {{the skin of}} amphibians. On <b>metamorphosing</b> animals the {{infection}} is difficult to detect because of the limited information concerning the location of Bd on the animals during this stage. Histological investigation revealed that Bd accumulated on the reabsorbing tail of <b>metamorphosing</b> animals. This observation may facilitate the detection of Bd in <b>metamorphosing</b> amphibians...|$|R
5|$|While most {{types of}} temnospondyls are {{distinguished}} {{on the basis}} of features in mature specimens, several are known from juvenile and larval specimens. Metamorphosis is seen in dissorophoids, eryopids, and zatrachydids, with aquatic larvae developing into adults capable of living on land. Several types of dissorophoids do not fully <b>metamorphose,</b> but retain features of juveniles such as gills and small body size in what is known as neoteny. Dvinosaurians and the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax were also neotenic because they retained gills, but they are only known from adult specimens.|$|E
5|$|It {{also has}} a more {{extensive}} classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow. The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they <b>metamorphose</b> and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack {{and the formation of}} ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{typically}} {{lay their}} eggs in water. The eggs hatch into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that have tails and internal gills. They have highly specialized rasping mouth parts suitable for herbivorous, omnivorous or planktivorous diets. The life cycle is completed when they <b>metamorphose</b> into adults. A few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole stage. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for predators {{and part of the}} food web dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems. The skin is semi-permeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce a wide range of vocalizations, particularly in their breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviours to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to Proterozoic Eon rocks, Archean Eon rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments, such as graywackes, mudstones, volcanic sediments, and banded iron formations. Carbonate rocks are rare, {{indicating that the}} oceans were more acidic due to dissolved carbon dioxide than during the Proterozoic. Greenstone belts are typical Archean formations, consisting of alternating units of <b>metamorphosed</b> mafic igneous and sedimentary rocks. The <b>metamorphosed</b> igneous rocks were derived from volcanic island arcs, while the <b>metamorphosed</b> sediments represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island arcs and deposited in a forearc basin. Greenstone belts, being both types of <b>metamorphosed</b> rock, represent sutures between the protocontinents.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} said that Asteria, the sister of Leto <b>metamorphosed</b> into a quail (Ortux), threw herself into the sea, and was <b>metamorphosed</b> into the island Ortygia. Another myth {{suggested}} that it was Delos instead of Ortygia.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} explore the thermal history of {{enstatite}} chondrites, we examined the cathodoluminescence (CL) and thermoluminescence (TL) properties of 15 EH chondrites and 21 EL chondrites, including all available petrographic types, both textural types 3 - 6 and mineralogical types alpha-delta. The CL properties of EL 3 (alpha) and EH 3 (alpha) chondrites are similar. Enstatite grains high in Mn and other transition metals display red CL, while enstatite with low concentrations of these elements show blue CL. A few enstatite grains with greater than 5 wt% FeO display no CL. In contrast, the luminescent properties of the <b>metamorphosed</b> EH chondrites {{are very different from}} those of <b>metamorphosed</b> EL chondrites. While the enstatites in <b>metamorphosed</b> EH chondrites display predominantly blue CL, the enstatites in <b>metamorphosed</b> EL chondrites display a distinctive magenta CL with blue and red peaks of approximately equal intensity in their spectra. The TL sensitivities of the enstatite chondrites correlate with the intensity of the blue CL and, unlike other meteorite classes, are not simply related to metamorphism. The different luminescent properties of <b>metamorphosed</b> EH and EL chondrites cannot readily be attributed to compositional differences. But x-ray diffraction data suggests that the enstatite in EH 5 (gamma),(delta) chondrites is predominantly disordered orthopyroxene, while enstatite in EL 6 (beta) chondrites is predominantly ordered orthopyroxene. The difference in thermal history of <b>metamorphosed</b> EL and EH chondrites is so marked that the use of single 'petrographic' types is misleading, and separate textural and mineralogical types are preferable. Our data confirm earlier suggestions that <b>metamorphosed</b> EH chondrites underwent relatively rapid cooling, and the <b>metamorphosed</b> EL chondrites cooled more slowly and experienced prolonged heating in the orthopyroxene field...|$|R
5|$|In {{traditional}} medicinal texts, Platyhelminthes {{are divided}} into Turbellaria, which are mostly non-parasitic animals such as planarians, and three entirely parasitic groups: Cestoda, Trematoda and Monogenea; however, since the turbellarians have since been proven not to be monophyletic, this classification is now deprecated. Free-living flatworms are mostly predators, and live in water or in shaded, humid terrestrial environments, such as leaf litter. Cestodes (tapeworms) and trematodes (flukes) have complex life-cycles, with mature stages that live as parasites in the digestive systems of fish or land vertebrates, and intermediate stages that infest secondary hosts. The eggs of trematodes are excreted from their main hosts, whereas adult cestodes generate vast numbers of hermaphroditic, segment-like proglottids that detach when mature, are excreted, and then release eggs. Unlike the other parasitic groups, the monogeneans are external parasites infesting aquatic animals, and their larvae <b>metamorphose</b> into the adult form after attaching to a suitable host.|$|E
5|$|Snow {{refers to}} forms of ice {{crystals}} that precipitate {{from the atmosphere}} (usually from clouds) and undergo changes on the Earth's surface. It pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then <b>metamorphose</b> in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take {{on a variety of}} shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.|$|E
5|$|The {{larval stage}} of dragonflies lasts {{up to five}} years in large species, and between two months and three years in smaller species. When the naiad is ready to <b>metamorphose</b> into an adult, it stops feeding and makes its way to the surface, {{generally}} at night. It remains stationary with its head out of the water, while its respiration system adapts to breathing air, then climbs up a reed or other emergent plant, and moults (ecdysis). Anchoring itself firmly in a vertical position with its claws, its skin begins to split at a weak spot behind the head. The adult dragonfly crawls out of its larval skin, the exuvia, arching backwards when all but the tip of its abdomen is free, to allow its exoskeleton to harden. Curling back upwards, it completes its emergence, swallowing air, which plumps out its body, and pumping haemolymph into its wings, which causes them to expand to their full extent.|$|E

5|$|Some frogs {{protect their}} {{offspring}} inside their own bodies. Both {{male and female}} pouched frogs (Assa darlingtoni) guard their eggs, which are laid on the ground. When the eggs hatch, the male lubricates his body with the jelly surrounding them and immerses himself in the egg mass. The tadpoles wriggle into skin pouches on his side, where they develop until they <b>metamorphose</b> into juvenile frogs. The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus sp.) from Australia, now probably extinct, swallows her fertilized eggs, which then develop inside her stomach. She ceases to feed and stops secreting stomach acid. The tadpoles rely on the yolks of the eggs for nourishment. After six or seven weeks, they are ready for metamorphosis. The mother regurgitates the tiny frogs, which hop away from her mouth. The female Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii) from Chile lays up to 40 eggs on the ground, where they are guarded by the male. When the tadpoles are about to hatch, they are engulfed by the male, which carries them around inside his much-enlarged vocal sac. Here they are immersed in a frothy, viscous liquid that contains some nourishment to supplement what they obtain from the yolks of the eggs. They remain in the sac for seven to ten weeks before undergoing metamorphosis, after which they move into the male's mouth and emerge.|$|E

25|$|The larvae of the Pacific oyster are planktotrophic, and {{are about}} 70µm at the prodissoconch 1 stage. The larvae {{move through the}} water column via {{the use of a}} larval foot to find {{suitable}} settlement locations. They can spend several weeks at this phase, which is dependent on water temperature, salinity and food supply. Over these weeks, larvae can disperse great distances by water currents before they <b>metamorphose</b> and settle as small spat. Similar to other oyster species, once the Pacific oyster larvae find a suitable habitat, they attach to it permanently using cement secreted from a gland in their foot. After settlement, the larvae <b>metamorphose</b> into juvenile spat. The growth rate is very rapid in optimum environmental conditions, and market size can be achieved in 18 to 30 months.|$|E
