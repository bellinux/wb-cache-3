5|$|Individuals with {{breathing}} difficulties due to asthma or allergies may experience additional barriers to quality sleep {{that can be}} addressed by specific variations of sleep hygiene recommendations. Difficulty with breathing can cause disruptions to sleep, reducing the ability to stay asleep and to achieve restful sleep. For individuals with allergies or asthma, additional considerations {{must be given to}} potential triggers in the bedroom environment. Medications that might improve ability to breathe while sleeping may also impair sleep in other ways, so there <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> management of decongestants, asthma controllers, and antihistamines.|$|E
5|$|Balthier is Archadian {{by birth}} (as {{evidenced}} by his English accent, {{which is used}} by Archadian characters in the game), and eventually reveals he is , the son of Imperial magicite researcher Dr. Cid (Cidolfus Demen Bunansa). Balthier received many privileges as Cid's son, including being made an Imperial Judge, but eventually cut ties with his father when Cid became consumed by his experimentation with nethicite. He left {{the service of the}} empire, stole an Archadian airship, and took a new name. Balthier is now a renowned career criminal with a sizable bounty on his head, and <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> to avoid the attention of both the law and the bounty hunters seeking the reward for his capture. He originally joins the resistance in the hope of reacquiring the Dusk Shard, but when he learns it is actually a piece of nethicite, he sees too much of his father's obsession in his own quest and decides to abandon the search. After the party defeats Dr. Cid at the Pharos, Balthier makes peace with his father and helps the group to destroy the Sky Fortress Bahamut as penance for Cid's deeds.|$|E

5|$|As the game's {{emphasis}} is on stealth, players are encouraged to focus on concealment, evasion, distraction, misdirection, and subtle takedowns, rather than on outright confrontation; the player's character can engage in sword-based combat when the need arises, and can perform three different attacks as well as parrying, but has limited proficiency and damage resistance in such circumstances. To do so, players must remain aware of their surroundings. To assist them in remaining hidden, a special meter on the heads-up display (HUD), {{in the form of}} a gem, helps to indicates the player's visibility to NPCs; the brighter it is, the more easier they can be visually detected, thus sticking to dark, shady spots where the gem dims, ensures the player is hidden, though NPCs can still find them if they get to close in front of them. To remain quiet, players <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> of how much noise they produce, as well as what surfaces they are moving over; walking on soft surfaces like carpets and grass, is preferable as footsteps remain quiet, compared to walking over metal floors and ceramic tiles, which produce a lot of noise. NPCs also produce noise, either from whistling, or walking about for example, which can help player's determine where how far away they are to their own position. Noise can be used by the player to mislead/distract NPCs, such as throwing an object to lure them elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Controversies have {{surrounded}} bikeways, {{particularly in}} North America and the United Kingdom.

Proponents argue that dedicated bike lanes have been implemented in many cities and are both popular and safe.|$|E

25|$|Because {{there are}} four state variables, {{visualizing}} the path in phase space can be difficult.

25|$|The same rule {{applies to}} a judge while {{conducting}} a trial. In Mohammed Ali bin Johari v.

25|$|However, other {{researchers}} have contested {{the claims of the}} media effects paradigm.

It also argues that one <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> about making the leap from arguing that certain environmental conditions might cause body dissatisfaction to the claim that those conditions can cause diagnosable eating disorders.|$|E
25|$|The Green Line is {{actually}} four different lines; it starts as one trunk line but then splits into four different branches, the B (Boston College), C (Cleveland Circle), D (Riverside) and E (Heath Street) trains.

25|$|Understanding how {{to mediate}} {{top-down}} effects on crop populations {{caused by the}} enemies of herbivores as well as bottom-up effects of chemical composition in infected plants has important consequences {{for the management of}} agricultural industries.
