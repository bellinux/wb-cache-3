25|$|In {{advanced}} {{nations like}} the United Kingdom domestic violence victims <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulties</b> getting alternative housing which can {{force them to}} stay in the abusive relationship.|$|R
5|$|The {{long-term}} {{effect of}} female employment in QIZs {{are yet to}} be quantified, {{and there is some}} concern that over time, Jordanian women <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulty</b> in achieving higher wages in a global economy where apparel manufacturers can easily relocate to cheaper labor markets.|$|E
5|$|With {{the release}} of dual-layer Wii Optical Discs, Nintendo of America stated that some Wii systems <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulty</b> reading the {{high-density}} software (due to a contaminated laser lens). Nintendo offers retail lens-cleaning kits and free console repairs for owners who experience this issue.|$|E
5|$|Dental {{sealants}} {{are another}} preventive therapy {{often used to}} provide a barrier to bacteria and decay {{on the surface of}} teeth. Sealants can last up to ten years and are primarily used on the biting surfaces of molars of children and young adults, especially those who <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulty</b> brushing and flossing effectively. Sealants are applied in a dentist's office, sometimes by a dental hygienist, in an procedure similar in technique and cost to a fluoride application.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{important}} aspect of reading development is the understanding of narrative structures, which lends to better comprehension skills. Vocabulary development is closely associated with comprehension skills; those with weaker vocabularies <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulties</b> following narratives.|$|R
50|$|Intersex {{children}} in Mexico face significant human rights violations, starting from birth. There are no protections from non-consensual cosmetic medical interventions and no legislative protection from discrimination. Intersex persons <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulties</b> in obtaining necessary health care.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{children}} who are identified as having an intersex condition at birth were killed. This is beginning to change, according to midwives and birth attendants' organizations. Surviving intersex children <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulties</b> in obtaining birth certificates {{and other forms of}} identification.|$|R
5|$|Damage to {{the optic}} nerve (II) affects {{specific}} aspects of vision that depend on {{the location of the}} lesion. A person {{may not be able to}} see objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulty</b> seeing objects on their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the optic chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by examining the visual field, or by examining the retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in the optic nerve, or further along the visual pathways.|$|E
5|$|About a {{third to}} a half of {{individuals}} with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from {{the first year of}} life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, {{and are more likely to}} simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulty</b> with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E
5|$|The player {{generally}} has {{to explore the}} dungeon to reveal its contents similar to a fog of war. Many roguelikes include factors related to light sources such as a torch to provide illumination to see monsters in nearby squares, and line of sight can also limit what monsters are visible. Dungeons tend to be connected by stairs; lower dungeon levels generally are more difficult than higher ones, so that a character that is underdeveloped <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulty</b> by progressing too fast. Dungeon levels and the population of monsters and treasure within them are generated randomly using procedural generation, so that no game is the same on subsequent playthroughs. Most roguelikes have an ultimate goal of either claiming an item located at the deepest level of the dungeon, or to defeat a specific monster that lives on that level. Typical roguelikes include a scoreboard, ranking the player's performance once their game is over (be it through permadeath or completing the objective) based {{on the amount of}} treasure, money, and experience earned, and how fast the player completed the game in such cases.|$|E
50|$|Intersex {{people in}} Kenya face {{significant}} human rights violations, starting from birth. There are few protections from mutilation and non-consensual cosmetic medical interventions and no legislative protection from discrimination. Intersex persons <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulties</b> in obtaining birth certificates and others forms of documentation.|$|R
50|$|If {{assessed}} on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, for instance, symptoms may show as relatively low scores for Information, Vocabulary and Comprehension (perhaps below the 25th percentile). If a person <b>has</b> <b>difficulty</b> with spatial concepts, such as 'over', 'under', 'here' and 'there', they <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulties</b> with arithmetic, understanding word problems and instructions, or difficulties using words.|$|R
50|$|Some of Katya Rubia's main {{contributions}} to the field are that children with ADHD <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulties</b> with time perception and emotional processing. She has also highlighted that the interpretations of some research articles in ADHD can be questionable, because the participants were on medication.|$|R
25|$|If a woman {{decides to}} keep and raise the child, she <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulty</b> {{accepting}} it, and both mother and child face ostracism in some societies.|$|E
25|$|A similar problem {{occurs as}} BOD {{concentrations}} drop when low flow increases waste residence time within the secondary treatment bioreactor. Secondary treatment ecosystems of college communities acclimated to waste loading fluctuations from student work/sleep cycles <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulty</b> surviving school vacations. Secondary treatment systems accustomed to routine production cycles of industrial facilities <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulty</b> surviving industrial plant shutdown. Populations of species feeding on incoming waste initially decline as concentration of those food sources decrease. Population decline continues as ecosystem predator populations {{compete for a}} declining population of lower trophic level organisms.|$|E
25|$|The {{broadcasting}} satellites are geostationary, {{which causes}} them {{to be less than}} 10° above the horizon for locations north of 71.4° latitude. This means aircraft in areas of Alaska or northern Canada <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulty</b> maintaining a lock on the WAAS signal.|$|E
30|$|The {{different}} protocols <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulties</b> {{in handling}} {{some of these}} aspects {{depending on whether the}} aspects are present or not. In Section 4.3 and also Section 5.1, we will study these aspects, by modifying the trace data so that the model becomes binary and/or symmetric.|$|R
50|$|Children under extreme stress tend to {{withdraw}} from their family and friends. They spend more time alone and lack motivation. Children may begin to struggle in school and on their assignments. They <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulties</b> in paying attention and act with anger and irritability towards others.|$|R
50|$|Neurologic system findings: Patients <b>may</b> <b>have</b> {{learning}} <b>difficulties</b> {{and mental}} retardation.|$|R
25|$|Captive {{killer whales}} often give birth {{at a much}} younger age than in the wild, {{sometimes}} as young as age seven. The young mothers <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulty</b> raising their offspring. The calves have a relatively low survival rate, though some have lived into adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Affected {{individuals}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulty</b> {{moving and}} may experience spasms, jerking, rigidity or decreased muscle tone and muscle weakness (which {{may be the}} result of secondary carnitine deficiency). Glutaric aciduria type 1, in many cases, can be defined as a cerebral palsy of genetic origins.|$|E
25|$|Several Bandvagn 206 (Bv206) were {{transferred}} from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) to the SCDF, painted in the SCDF colours of red and white, and subsequently fitted with the necessary firefighting equipment and capabilities. The TFV is designed for use in forested areas where wheeled vehicles <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulty</b> in reaching.|$|E
50|$|Doubles are {{implemented}} in many programming languages {{in different ways}} such as the following. On processors with only dynamic precision, such as x86 without SSE2 (or when SSE2 is not used, for compatibility purpose) and with extended precision used by default, software <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulties</b> to fulfill some requirements.|$|R
40|$|To date {{very few}} studies have {{investigated}} the musical skills of children with specific language impairment (SLI). There is growing evidence that SLI affects areas other than language, and it is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that children with this disorder <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulties</b> in perceiving musical stimuli appropriately...|$|R
5000|$|Children who sugarcoat hostility <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulties</b> being assertive, never {{developing}} better {{coping strategies}} or skills for self-expression. They can become adults who, beneath a [...] "seductive veneer," [...] harbor [...] "vindictive intent," [...] {{in the words}} of US congressman/psychologist Timothy F. Murphy, and writer/practicing therapist Loriann Oberlin. Alternatively individuals <b>may</b> simply <b>have</b> <b>difficulty</b> being as directly aggressive or assertive as others. Martin Kantor suggests three areas that contribute to passive-aggressive anger in individuals: conflicts about dependency, control, and competition, and that a person may be termed passive-aggressive if they behave so to few people on most occasions.|$|R
25|$|While the JCT {{approach}} to job design {{has a significant}} impact on job satisfaction, the effects on performance are more mixed. Much of the success of implementation of JCT practices is dependent on the organization carefully planning interventions and changes to ensure impact throughout the organization is anticipated. Many companies <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulty</b> implementing JCT changes throughout the organization due to its high cost and complexity.|$|E
25|$|Insomnia, {{also known}} as sleeplessness, is a sleep {{disorder}} where people have trouble sleeping. They <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulty</b> falling asleep, or staying asleep as long as desired. Insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. It may result in {{an increased risk of}} motor vehicle collisions, as well as problems focusing and learning. Insomnia can be short term, lasting for days or weeks, or long term, lasting more than a month.|$|E
25|$|Even though {{functional}} units often {{perform with}} a high level of efficiency, their level of cooperation with each other is sometimes compromised. Such groups <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulty</b> working well with each other as they may be territorial and unwilling to cooperate. The occurrence of infighting among units may cause delays, reduced commitment due to competing interests, and wasted time, making projects fall behind schedule. This ultimately can bring down production levels overall, and the company-wide employee commitment toward meeting organizational goals.|$|E
50|$|Secondary to {{compression}} of the esophagus babies often feed poorly. They <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulties</b> in swallowing liquids with choking or regurgitating and increased respiratory obstruction during feeding. Older patients might {{refuse to take}} solid food, although most infants with severe symptoms nowadays are operated upon before they are offered solid food.|$|R
50|$|Persons {{with disabilities}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>difficulties</b> using turnstiles. In these cases, {{generally}} a wide aisle gate or a manual gate may be provided. At some locations where luggage is expected, {{a line of}} turnstiles may be entirely formed of wide aisle gates, for example at Heathrow Terminals 2 & 3 Underground station.|$|R
5000|$|Speakers <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>difficulty</b> {{with the}} Russian vowel {{reduction}} {{system as well}} as other allophonic vowels.|$|R
