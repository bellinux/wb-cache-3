5|$|After Copia's closure, the {{building}} had been used for a few <b>meetings</b> <b>and</b> <b>events,</b> including the Napa Valley Film Festival and BottleRock Napa Valley. Triad Development arranged to buy the entire site in 2015 and planned mixed use with housing and retail. The company planned to build up to 187 housing units, 30,000 square feet of retail space, and underground parking for 500 cars. The plan had later altered to only include purchase of the southern portion of the property. In 2015, the Culinary Institute of America (CIA) put in motion plans to acquire a separate portion of Copia. The college opened a campus, the Culinary Institute of America at Copia, which houses the CIA's new Food Business School. The school, which was outgrowing its St. Helena campus, acquired the northern portion of the property for $12.5 million in October 2015 (it was assessed for $21.3 million around 2013). Among the CIA's first events there was 2016's Flavor! Napa Valley, a food and wine festival sponsored by local organizations. The campus opened in late 2016, with its Chuck Williams Culinary Arts Museum opening in 2017. The museum will house about 4,000 items of Chuck Williams, including cookbooks, cookware, and appliances.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, Mary Dennett focused {{her efforts}} on the peace movement, but she {{returned}} to the birth control movement in 1918. She continued to lead the NBCL, and collaborated with Sanger's NYWPC. In 1919, Dennett published a widely distributed educational pamphlet, The Sex Side of Life, which treated sex as a natural and enjoyable act. However, in the same year, frustrated with the NBCL's chronic lack of funding, Dennett broke away and formed the Voluntary Parenthood League (VPL). Both Dennett and Sanger proposed legislative changes that would legalize birth control, but they took different approaches: Sanger endorsed contraception but only under a physician's supervision; Dennett pushed for unrestricted access to contraception.Engelman, pp. 113–115. Sanger, a proponent of diaphragms, was concerned that unrestricted access would result in ill-fitting diaphragms and would lead to medical quackery.McCann (1994), pp. 71–72 gives examples that show Sanger's fears were justified. Dennett was concerned that requiring women to get prescriptions from physicians would prevent poor women from receiving contraception, and she was concerned about a shortage of physicians trained in birth control. Both legislative initiatives failed, partly because some legislators felt that fear of pregnancy {{was the only thing that}} kept women chaste. In the early 1920s, Sanger's leadership position in the movement solidified because she gave frequent public lectures, and because she took steps to exclude Dennett from <b>meetings</b> <b>and</b> <b>events.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1996–97 season saw Oxford finish seventeenth, and {{included}} {{the sale of}} Scottish international defender Matt Elliott to Leicester City. Despite Smith's departure to West Bromwich Albion in December 1997, United finished twelfth the following season under his successor, and former captain, Malcolm Shotton. Shotton was previously the assistant manager of the Barnsley side that gained promotion to the Premier League. During October 1998, the backroom staff at the club went unpaid, due to United's financial situation with the new stadium, {{and the threat of}} administration caused a group of fans to set up a pressure group called Fighting for Oxford United's Life (FOUL). The group began to publicise the club's plight through a series of <b>meetings</b> <b>and</b> <b>events,</b> including a 'Scarf of Unity', which was a collection of scarfs from various clubs which was long enough to stretch {{around the perimeter of the}} pitch. Chairman Robin Herd stepped down to concentrate on his engineering projects, and in April 1999 Firoz Kassam bought Herd's 89.9% controlling interest in Oxford United for £1, with which he also inherited the club's estimated £15 million debt. Kassam reduced the £9 million of the debt to just £900,000, by virtue of a Company Voluntary Arrangement, by which unsecured creditors who were owed over £1,000 were reimbursed with 10p for every pound they were owed. Secured creditors were paid off when Kassam sold the Manor to another of his companies, for £6 million. Kassam set about completing the unfinished stadium, gaining planning permission for a bowling alley, multiplex cinema and hotel next to the stadium, following a series of legal battles which were eventually all settled. The season ended with relegation back to the Second Division.|$|E

25|$|Over the years, the Chapel Bell {{has served}} as an {{athletic}} tradition at the University of Georgia. The ringing of the Chapel Bell after a Georgia victory is a tradition that has endured since the 1890s. In Georgia football's early days, the playing field was located only yards from the chapel, and first-year students were compelled to ring the bell until midnight in celebration of a Bulldog victory. Today, students, alumni, fans and townspeople still rush to the Chapel to ring the bell after a victory. The bell is also utilized for University <b>meetings</b> <b>and</b> <b>events,</b> weddings and remembrance ringing. The bell was rung in memory of victims of the September 11th attacks in 2001.

25|$|In July 1999, Conrad Black– {{the then}} {{proprietor}} of The Daily Telegraph and The Spectator– offered Johnson the editorship {{of the latter}} {{on the condition that}} he abandoned his parliamentary aspirations; Johnson agreed. He brought in contributions from figures whom he had known from his past and, while retaining The Spectators traditional right-wing bent, he also welcomed contributions from leftist writers and cartoonists. Under Johnson's editorship, the circulation of The Spectator grew by 10% to 62,000 and it began to turn a profit. His editorship also drew criticism; some opined that under his leadership The Spectator avoided covering serious issues and focused on trivial topics, while colleagues became annoyed that he was regularly absent from the office and often missed <b>meetings</b> <b>and</b> <b>events.</b> He gained a reputation as a poor political pundit {{as a result of the}} incorrect political predictions that he made in the magazine, and was also strongly criticised– including by his father-in-law Charles Wheeler– for allowing Spectator columnist Taki Theodoracopulos to publish racist and anti-Semitic language in the magazine.|$|E
500|$|On February 4, 1919, the Senate {{unanimously}} passed Senator Thomas J.

This decision followed months of sensational daily press coverage of revolutionary events abroad and Bolshevik <b>meetings</b> <b>and</b> <b>events</b> in the United States, which increased anti-radical public opinion. Reports that some of these meetings were attended by Congressmen caused further outrage. One meeting in particular, held at the Poli Theater in Washington, DC, was widely controversial because of a speech given by Albert Rhys Williams, a popular Congregationalist minister, who allegedly said, [...] "America sooner or later is going to accept the Soviet Government." ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Events</b> <b>and</b> other <b>meetings</b> are an {{important}} component of the tourism industry. The activities around <b>events</b> <b>and</b> other <b>meetings</b> bring people together and offer communities an opportunity to celebrate and showcase their traditions, culture and way of life. As the major stakeholders in such activities realise the significant economic benefits of holding <b>events</b> <b>and</b> <b>meetings,</b> governments <b>and</b> operators are making significant capital investment in developing the necessary facilities and infrastructure to accommodate this sector of the tourism industry. Whilst the flury of activities has a number of positive economic impacts, such as job creation and increased revenue there are also potential negative consequences. The quality of the economic, social and natural environments in which such activity takes place is at risk. As a result there has been a realisation, particularly by educators and researchers that there is a need to incorporate sustainability into <b>meeting</b> <b>and</b> <b>event</b> management. The Best Education Network (BEST) has addressed this gap by holding workshops for the purpose of identifying objectives that can be used in the development of a short teaching module for sustainable <b>meeting</b> <b>and</b> <b>event</b> management. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the need to incorporate sustainability into <b>meeting</b> <b>and</b> <b>event</b> management; to describe the process used by BEST to identify sustainable <b>meeting</b> <b>and</b> <b>event</b> objectives; <b>and</b> to present the learning objectives that were identified, as a result of this process...|$|R
