5|$|Arab historians {{argue that}} Israel {{had entered the}} Battle of Karameh with too <b>much</b> <b>confidence,</b> since it took place just after Israel had {{defeated}} the Arabs in the 1967 Six-Day War. The size of the Israeli forces entering Karameh made the Jordanians assume that Israel was also planning to occupy the eastern bank of the Jordan River, including the Balqa Governorate, {{in order to create}} a Golan Heights similar situation so as to be used a bargaining chip. Jordanians claim that Moshe Dayan invited Israeli journalists on the previous day for lunch in western Jordan after occupying it.|$|E

He scored 43 in the nine-wicket win over Bangladesh {{but was not}} required to bat in the seven-wicket win over Zimbabwe. New captain Sourav Ganguly—who had taken over after Sachin Tendulkar resigned following the South African whitewash—did not show <b>much</b> <b>confidence</b> in him, by only affording him frequent but short spells. Kartik was dropped from the team after the First Test against Zimbabwe, {{and did not have}} an opportunity to immediately prove his captain wrong, as the one-day domestic circuit was in progress at the time. Kartik took nine wickets at 25.22 at an economy rate of 4.02, and then had a chance to stake his claims for a Test recall in the Duleep Trophy.|$|E
5|$|The {{news that}} {{powerful}} air support {{was on its}} way to bolster the 6th Army boosted German morale. Army commanders, such as Paulus and Bock, placed so <b>much</b> <b>confidence</b> in the Luftwaffe that they ordered their forces not to risk an attack without air support. In the meantime, Fliegerkorps VI, was forced to use every available aircraft. Although meeting more numerous Soviet air forces, he achieved air superiority and limited the German ground forces' losses to Soviet aviation, but with some crews flying more than 10 missions per day. By 15 May, Pflugbeil was reinforced and received Kampfgeschwader 27 (Bomber Wing 27, or KG 27), Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51), Kampfgeschwader 55 (KG 55) and Kampfgeschwader 76 (KG 76) equipped with Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111 bombers. Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 (Dive Bomber Wing 77, or StG 77) also arrived to add direct ground support. Pflugbeil now had 10 bomber, six fighter and four Junkers Ju 87 Stuka Gruppen (Groups). Logistical difficulties meant that only 54.5 per cent were operational.|$|E

25|$|While Dupont lingered at Andújar {{with two}} {{divisions}} (Generals Barbou and Fresia), attempting {{to master the}} strategic Madrid—Seville highway and the wide plains which it crossed, Castaños' four divisions advanced steadily {{from the south and}} guerrillas from Granada marched to bar the road to the sierra and La Mancha beyond. Vedel's division was posted east to Bailén with a view to guarding these nearby mountain passes and on July 1 Vedel was forced to dispatch a brigade under General Cassagne to curb the advance of the guerrillas on Jaén and La Carolina, stretching the French line still further east. Meanwhile, General Liger-Belair with 1,500 men moved into a forward post at Mengibar, a village on the south bank of the Guadalquivir. At Andújar a tower by the river was fortified and small field works constructed on the south bank to forestall an enemy crossing, but, the Guadalquivir being fordable at so many points, and open to fire from the surrounding hills, Dupont's defences did not inspire <b>much</b> <b>confidence.</b> Cassagne, after driving the guerrillas off in rout, returned to Bailén on July 5 with 200 dead or wounded and nothing to show for his exertion—the Spaniards having plundered the towns of all provisions.|$|E

[...] "Nobody gave me so <b>much</b> <b>confidence</b> to have a lead from, nobody gave me so much exhilaration and fun.

In fact, Clark himself was taken aback by the apparent scope of his influence on colonial affairs, writing to his wife, “Governor Kuroda consults me constantly and always follows my advice.” He later wrote, “I tremble to think how <b>much</b> <b>confidence</b> is reposed in me and what responsibilities I am daily assuming.” ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1834, while at Berne, Mazzini and a dozen {{refugees}} from Italy, Poland and Germany founded a new association with the grandiose name of Young Europe. Its basic, and equally grandiose idea, was that, as the French Revolution of 1789 had enlarged the concept of individual liberty, another revolution would now be needed for national liberty; and his vision went further because he hoped that in the no doubt distant future free nations might combine to form a loosely federal Europe {{with some kind of}} federal assembly to regulate their common interests. [...] His intention was nothing less than to overturn the European settlement agreed [...] in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna, which had reestablished an oppressive hegemony of a few great powers and blocked the emergence of smaller nations. [...] Mazzini hoped, but without <b>much</b> <b>confidence,</b> that his vision of a league or society of independent nations would be realized in his own lifetime. In practice Young Europe lacked the money and popular support for more than a short-term existence. Nevertheless he always remained faithful to the ideal of a united continent for which the creation of individual nations would be an indispensable preliminary.|$|E
500|$|David-Lloyd {{described}} the character's {{development in the}} third series as [...] "really exciting". He {{felt that it was}} [...] "great to be a fully-fledged member of the team now rather than just the administration man." [...] He felt flattered to have the writer and producers put so <b>much</b> <b>confidence</b> in him. In this series, the writers also explore Jones's background; David-Lloyd was happy with the execution of this backstory, through meeting Ianto's sister, and commented that it was quite beautifully written. Through meeting his family, we discover that his father has died and that Ianto has grown very distant from his relatives as per the demands of his job. David-Lloyd first concluded that Ianto was being killed off when his agent told him he was only needed for four out of five episodes. Although there was [...] "a bit of disappointment", he considers himself [...] "lucky" [...] for lasting so long on the series, especially since Ianto was supposed to die in series two. He believed the character's death was justified by [...] "the impact and the drama, and to keep the dangerous reality of Torchwood ever present". Although it was [...] "a tragedy that [...] died", David-Lloyd felt that the series had [...] "addressed everything about him that needed to be said".|$|E

500|$|John Sherman was a {{longtime}} senator from Ohio who also served {{the state in}} the House of Representatives in the late 1850s and early 1860s. As a senator, Sherman led the planning of the national banking system. He also oversaw the national policy for the post-Civil War banking system, and helped restore the nation's finances after the Panic of 1873. Under President Hayes, Sherman served as the Secretary of the Treasury, advocating for the gold standard and building up the country's gold reserves. Sherman's colleagues did not have <b>much</b> <b>confidence</b> in their presidential bid. Sherman was known as the [...] "Ohio Icicle" [...] for his uncharismatic personality, which made him unappealing to voters. His colleagues commented that in public, Sherman [...] "was not eloquent, though a graceful speaker, confining himself almost entirely to statements of fact." [...] In private, he was [...] "reserved, self-contained," [...] a personality that many Americans were not comfortable with. As President, Sherman intended to continue his support for the gold standard. Prior {{to the start of the}} convention, papers had predicted Sherman to receive 110 votes in the balloting. Sherman felt that he still had a chance at the nomination once the Grant vote broke apart after five or six ballots.|$|E

Jack: 'What are you talking about? It's May.'" [...] Canning gave it an 8.5 out of 10 rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{wrote that the}} [...] "all-star cast of musicians" [...] featured were not able to dominate the episode [...] "to the point where the episode didn't work." [...] Sepinwall, however, added that despite [...] "Kidney Now!" [...] not being a classic 30 Rock episode [...] "it was [...] funny enough – which, I suppose, also makes it an appropriate finale for this uneven season." [...] Further in the review, Sepinwall was complimentary towards Liz's plot, writing that the character's sequence on The Vontella Show was [...] "hilarious, and a fine demonstration of how <b>much</b> <b>confidence</b> Tina Fey has gained as an actress over the years." [...] The A.V. Club’s Nathan Rabin also enjoyed the Liz character, reporting that she [...] "delivered a virtuoso performance in , instantly homing in on the fatal flaw in every relationship and obliterating it with highly quotable sass." [...] In discussion to Tracy's plot, Rabin opined it was the [...] "weakest of the various threads" [...] in this episode. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad confessed in his recap {{that he was going to}} summarize [...] "Kidney Now!"
