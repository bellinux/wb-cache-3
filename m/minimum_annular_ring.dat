40|$|Abstract—A {{miniaturized}} <b>annular</b> <b>ring</b> {{slot antenna}} is presented. The antenna {{consists of an}} <b>annular</b> <b>ring</b> slot structure and a novel folded matching structure. The <b>annular</b> <b>ring</b> slot structure is printed on a substrate and shorted concentrically {{with a set of}} conductive vias. The additional matching structure is a ring cavity attached {{to the back of the}} <b>annular</b> <b>ring</b> slot structure. Firstly, the diameter of the proposed antenna is reduced by using the folded matching structure comparing with traditional <b>annular</b> <b>ring</b> slot antennas. Secondly, the impedance matching of the proposed antenna is achieved by optimizing the size of the matching structure. A prototype of the proposed antenna with a height of 3. 048 mm (0. 03 λ) and a radius of 47. 2 mm (0. 4 λ) is designed, fabricated and measured.

40|$|This article {{concerns}} <b>annular</b> <b>ring</b> solutions of the Gray–Scott model. In the monostable regime, <b>annular</b> <b>rings</b> are far-fromequilibrium patterns {{supported on}} annuli inside {{of which the}} activator is concentrated. The diffusive flux of inhibitor over long length scales toward such an annulus feeds the production of activator there, and the interaction is semi-strong. Numerical and experimental observations show that <b>annular</b> <b>rings</b> often split into spots, and the main result {{presented in this article}} is a method to predict the number of spots that an <b>annular</b> <b>ring,</b> unstable to angular disturbances, will split into. This method is an extension to 2 D circular geometries of the nonlocal eigenvalue problem (NLEP) method developed for pulse solutions of the 1 D Gray–Scott problem, in which the full eigenvalue problem—a pair of second-order, nonautonomous coupled equations—is recast as a single, second-order equation with a nonlocal term. We also continue the results for the monostable regime into the bistable regime of the Gray–Scott model, where target patterns exist and their rings are observed to destabilize into rings of spots, as may be shown using a classical Turing/Ginzburg–Landau analysis. Thus, for these 2 D circular geometries, the NLEP method is to the instability of <b>annular</b> <b>rings</b> in the monostable regime what the Turing analysis is to the instability of target patterns in the bistable regime near criticality...|$|R

Novel segmented dual aperture-coupled multiband <b>annular</b> <b>ring</b> antenna covers, three practical wireless communication bands, are 1. 8 GHz is for lower WLAN band, 3. 5 GHz for lower WiMAX frequency and 5. 6 GHz for WiFi communication band. The widest bandwidth achieved is at 1. 8 GHz resonant with 210 MHz fractional bandwidth. The novel multiband arrow slot aperture-coupled halo <b>annular</b> <b>ring</b> microstrip patch antenna has six operating frequency bands and all the bands achieved can be used in current communication bands. The former three bands fall into LTE Band 21, Band 30 and Band 7. The later three bands fall into satellite communication C band and upper WLAN 5. 7 GHz band. Then these two novel multiband antenna designs are placed individually on 6 inch by 6 inch wireless router ground plane to investigate its MIMO implementation.

An <b>annular</b> compression <b>ring</b> with a tapered internal bore surface is arranged about the cannula with the tapered internal surface in a facing relationship to the external tapered surface. The angle of inclination of the tapered surfaces is converging such that the spacing between the tapered surfaces decreases {{from one end of the}} external tapered surface to the other end thereby providing a clamping action of the tapered surface on a cannula which increases as a function of the length of cannula segment between the tapered surfaces. The <b>annular</b> compression <b>ring</b> is disposed within a tubular locking nut which threadedly couples to the pump and provides a compression force for urging the <b>annular</b> <b>ring</b> onto the cannula between the tapered surfaces.
