5|$|The {{state of}} Florida {{received}} a federal Major Disaster Declaration on September 12. Franklin, Levy, Manatee, and Pinellas counties—where the storm left 5,000 individuals without work—became eligible for federal aid after President Ronald Reagan visited {{the state and}} determined that residents in those areas would benefit from assistance such as temporary housing, low-interest loans for rebuilding efforts, and monetary grants. Disaster centers were opened in those four counties as centralized locations for federal, state, and volunteer agencies to operate relief programs. President Reagan later included Hillsborough, Wakulla, and Dixie counties, bringing {{the total number of}} Florida counties eligible for federal aid to seven. The deadline for residents of all seven counties to apply for either state or federal assistance was set for November 12. Several major corporations—including Texaco, Exxon, and J.C. Penney—contacted customers in the affected areas and offered to make special arrangements for their <b>monthly</b> <b>payments</b> if they had been financially affected by the storm. While {{only a small number of}} customers took advantage of the assistance, the companies' actions were met with highly positive feedback.|$|E

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that the Sicilian Mafia costs the Sicilian economy more than €10 billion a year through protection rackets. Roughly 70 percent of Sicilian businesses pay protection money to Cosa Nostra. <b>Monthly</b> <b>payments</b> can range from €200 for a small shop or bar to €5,000 for a supermarket. In Sicily, protection money is known as pizzo; the anti-extortion support group Addiopizzo derives its name from this. Mafiosi might sometimes ask for favours instead of money, such as assistance in committing a crime.|$|E

40|$|Background: Optometric {{practices}} offer {{contact lenses}} as cash sale items or {{as part of}} <b>monthly</b> <b>payment</b> plans. With the contact lens market becoming increasingly competitive, patients are opting to purchase lenses from supermarkets and Internet suppliers. <b>Monthly</b> <b>payment</b> plans are often implemented to improve loyalty. This study aimed to compare behavioural loyalty between <b>monthly</b> <b>payment</b> plan members and non-members. Methods: BBR Optometry Ltd offers a <b>monthly</b> <b>payment</b> plan (Eyelife™) to their contact lens wearers. A retrospective audit of 38 Eyelife™ members (mean. ±. SD: 42. 7. ±. 15. 0 years) and 30 non-members (mean. ±. SD: 40. 8. ±. 16. 7 years) was conducted. Revenue and profits generated, service uptake and product sales between the two groups were compared over a fixed period of 18 months. Results: Eyelife™ members generated significantly higher professional fee revenue (P<. 0. 001), £ 153. 96 compared to £ 83. 50, and profits (P<. 0. 001). Eyelife™ members had a higher uptake of eye examinations (P<. 0. 001). The 2 groups demonstrated no significant difference in spectacle sales by volume (P= 0. 790) or value (P= 0. 369). There were also no significant differences in contact lens revenue (P= 0. 337), although Eyelife™ members did receive a discount. The Eyelife™ group incurred higher contact lens costs (P= 0. 037), due to a greater volume of contact lens purchases, 986 units compared to 582. Conclusions: <b>Monthly</b> <b>payment</b> plans improve loyalty among contact lens wearers, particularly service uptake and volume of lens purchases. Additionally the greater professional fees generated, render <b>monthly</b> <b>payment</b> plans an attractive business model and practice builder...|$|R

25|$|This also {{explains}} why a 15-year mortgage and a 30-year mortgage {{with the same}} APR would have different <b>monthly</b> <b>payments</b> and a different total amount of interest paid. There are many more periods over which to spread the principal, which makes the payment smaller, but there are just as many periods over which to charge interest at the same rate, which makes {{the total amount of}} interest paid much greater. For example, $100,000 mortgaged (without fees, since they add into the calculation in a different way) over 15 years costs a total of $193,429.80 (interest is 93.430% of principal), but over 30 years, costs a total of $315,925.20 (interest is 215.925% of principal).|$|E

The consumers contended that Chase, {{with little or no}} notice, increased minimum <b>monthly</b> <b>payments</b> from 2% to 5% on loan balances that were transferred to consumers' credit cards based on the promise of a fixed interest rate. In May 2011, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California certified the class action lawsuit. On July 23, 2012, Chase agreed to pay $100 million to settle the claim.|$|E

Afterwards, the manager discovered that the thief was Kobayashi, now working in Kawai. On November 17, 2004, the day of the kidnapping, a judge had issued an arrest warrant for Kobayashi for the embezzlement reported by the manager. However, the manager did not inform the police of this, because he was promised that the suspect would repay him for the stolen money with <b>monthly</b> <b>payments.</b> Therefore, the police were not able to arrest Kobayashi, and he was free to commit his attack.|$|E

25|$|For {{fifteen years}} nearly 12,000 workers {{worked on the}} {{construction}} of the canal. Riquet hired men and women between 20 and 50 years old who he organized in sections forming workshops led by a controller-general. This rationalization of work permitted the optimisation of tasks and allowed several projects to be performed at the same time. All of the work was manual and the digging of the canal was with shovels and pickaxes. The workforce was made up of farmers and local workers whose number varied from one period to another during the year. Pierre-Paul Riquet appealed to the military to compensate for this fluctuation. He also set up <b>monthly</b> <b>payments</b> of workers for their loyalty. He also offered accommodation for two deniers per day.|$|E
25|$|To help {{mitigate}} the declining population, the government {{continues to increase}} child support payments. Thus it provides one-time payments of 12,250 hryvnias for the first child, 25,000 Hryvnias for the second and 50,000 Hryvnias for the third and fourth, along with <b>monthly</b> <b>payments</b> of 154 hryvnias per child. The demographic trend is showing signs of improvement, as the birth rate has been steadily growing since 2001. Net population growth over {{the first nine months}} of 2007 was registered in five provinces of the country (out of 24), and population shrinkage was showing signs of stabilising nationwide. In 2007 the highest birth rates were in the western oblasts. In 2008, Ukraine emerged from lowest-low fertility, and the upward trend has continued since, except for a slight dip in 2010 because of the economic crisis of 2009 (see demographic tables).|$|E

Sports Illustrated reported that Jágr agreed to make <b>monthly</b> <b>payments</b> to Caesar to settle the debt, and Caesar leaked the story to the press when Jágr stopped making payments. In 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a $3.27 million lien against him for unpaid taxes for the 2001 tax year.
