Copper sulfides processing {{accounts for more than}} 90 % of world’s production. Among the copper sulfides, chalcopyrite constitutes the vast majority of copper resources and reserves, and therefore represents a <b>mineralogical</b> <b>species</b> of great economical importance (Doebrich [2009]).|$|E

The gold {{content in the}} concentrate was 95 g/t, whereas the main <b>mineralogical</b> <b>species</b> were chalcopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, tennantite and sphalerite. The experimental variables studied were: (i) Cu(II) concentration (0 – 6. 5 g Cu(II) (added) per liter of leaching solution), (ii) thiosulphate concentration (0. 1 – 0. 7 M), (iii) pH (9 – 10) and (iv) pulp density (10 – 40...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was mineralogical and {{chemical}} analysis of mortar from the floor, ceiling and wall of Stibadium B, from the archaeological site of Mediana. ICP-OES and FTIR-spectroscopy were used to determine chemical composition and some major <b>mineralogical</b> <b>species.</b> The obtained results show that lime mortar is probably used. Large contribution of silicon- and aluminum-oxides, indicate the presence of quartz and clay minerals derived from the aggregate, river sand and crushed bricks. The obtained results also show large amount of iron, manganese and copper. The determinated metals in samples from floor and wall of Stibadium B, are mostly present in oxide fraction, while in sample from ceiling, they are mostly found in silicate fraction...|$|E
40|$|Mapping {{localized}} spectral {{features in}} large images demands sensitive and robust detection algorithms. Two aspects of large images that can harm matched-filter detection performance are addressed simultaneously. First, multimodal backgrounds may thwart the typical Gaussian model. Second, outlier features can trigger false detections from large projections onto the target vector. Two state-of-the-art approaches are combined that independently address outlier false positives and multimodal backgrounds. The background clustering models multimodal backgrounds, and the mixture tuned matched filter (MT-MF) addresses outliers. Combining the two methods captures significant additional performance benefits. The resulting mixture tuned clutter matched filter (MT-CMF) shows effective performance on simulated and airborne datasets. The classical MNF transform was applied, followed by k-means clustering. Then, each cluster s mean, covariance, {{and the corresponding}} eigenvalues were estimated. This yields a cluster-specific matched filter estimate {{as well as a}} cluster- specific feasibility score to flag outlier false positives. The technology described is a proof of concept that may be employed in future target detection and mapping applications for remote imaging spectrometers. It is of most direct relevance to JPL proposals for airborne and orbital hyperspectral instruments. Applications include subpixel target detection in hyperspectral scenes for military surveillance. Earth science applications include <b>mineralogical</b> mapping, <b>species</b> discrimination for ecosystem health monitoring, and land use classification...|$|R
40|$|Hyper/Multispectral data provide {{information}} about characteristic of natural and antropic surfaces. In order to retrieve the <b>mineralogical</b> <b>species</b> composing the Castel Porziano Beach (CPB), remote sensed data needs to be atmospherically corrected. In this work a new tool for the atmospheric correction for spaceborne EO data, based on MODTRAN and 6 S codes, and developed on IDL/ENVI platform will be proposed and tested using NASA HYPERION and ASTER data. In this paper the capability to identify mineral association composing the sand of the CPB emerged beach, using hyperspectral data is shown. In order to define the mineralogical composition of the collected sample, SEM EMPA (Scanning Electron Microscopy and Electron MicroProbe Analyser) and optical polarizing microscopy analysis have been done. Results have been compared with 300 measurements performed directly on the CPB sand and 300 measurement acquired in the laboratory, both using an ASD-Fieldspec...|$|E

This study utilizes the application of digital techniques to image processing, {{in an attempt to}} define microstructural and microtextural characteristics of the ore, since they {{play an important role in}} the subsequent beneficiation operations (i. e., flotation). Scientific and economic information bound to complex metallogenic phenomenology and referred to particular paragenetic scenes was acquired by the study in detail of inclusions of main <b>mineralogical</b> <b>species</b> such as pyrite, sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite combined with quartzose-carbonate-micaceous gangues and a particular silico-marly ''slate''.

40|$|The rare organic mineral dinite {{was found}} {{during the last}} century at Castelnuovo Garfagnana, Tuscany, Italy. After a {{chemical}} study, which indicated an erroneous chemical formula C 18 H 16, it was stored in the Mineralogical Museum of the University of Pisa, where it was recently relocated. A new chemical analysis was carried out on dinite, and NMR, IR and mass spectra are presented here. The new data allows a re-definition of dinite as a distinct <b>mineralogical</b> <b>species,</b> with chemical formula C 20 H 36. Single crystal X-ray diffraction work showed dinite to be orthorhombic, space group P 2 (1) 2 (1) 2 (1), with a = 12. 356, b = 12. 762, c = 11. 427 angstrom.

40|$|AbstractTrace {{elements}} in particles of the phosphate ore and their behaviour {{in the various}} mineralurgic modes of processing were studied to: (i) locate {{the importance of these}} contents according to granulometry, their association with the existing <b>mineralogical</b> <b>species,</b> and (ii) check if the enrichment operations applied are compatible with a kind of processing. We used several methods of preconditioned analyses to (i) define the optimal meshes of release of the phosphatic elements and gangue minerals, (ii) identify the raw material mineralogical phases, the major elements chemical composition, their distribution into particle-size classes, and their thermal behaviour. X-ray fluorescence and ICP-MS allowed to identify 30 REE and transition metals. We obtained significant differences in the particle shapes, especially the fine ones and in the mineralurgic modes of treatment used, where the floatation processing is prevailing. A close relation between trace elements and various minerals (apatite, dolomite and silicates), through operations of substitution, is evidenced...|$|E
40|$|The {{mineralogy}} and petrology of 17 near-earth asteroids {{are characterized}} using reflectance spectroscopy with ground-based telescopes. Assuming the surfaces {{are composed of}} cosmically abundant materials, the presence of certain <b>mineralogical</b> <b>species</b> can be determined from diagnostic absorption features and spectral characteristics which have been studied under known laboratory conditions and {{understood in terms of}} crystal-field theory. With one possible exception, the surface composition of near-earth asteroids consists of common rock-forming minerals such as olivine, pyroxene, and phyllosilicates. Opaque components are present but cannot be mineralogically identified with existing experimental data. The spectrum of 2201 Oljato cannot be interpreted in terms of common rock-forming minerals and is examined for cometary features because its high orbital eccentricity suggests a possible relation to comets, but no common cometary features are identified. The predominance of mafic silicate absorption features in spectra of near-earth asteroids (compared to the majority of main-belt asteroids) may be a primary compositional feature or may be the signature of relatively fresher asteroid material...|$|E
40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{study was conducted}} to evaluate lung retention of particles containing cerium in subjects with and without previous occupational exposure to mineral dusts. Analytical transmission electron microscopy was performed on 459 samples of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and 75 samples of lung tissue. Study of the distribution of <b>mineralogical</b> <b>species</b> in human samples showed that particles containing cerium were encountered in less than 10 % of subjects. The proportion of subjects with particles containing cerium in their biological samples was not different between controls and subjects with previous occupational exposure to fibrous or nonfibrous mineral dusts. This was considered as the background level of lung retention of cerium in the general population. By contrast, determination of the absolute concentration of particles containing cerium in BAL fluid and lung tissue samples showed that 1. 2 % (from BAL fluid) and 1. 5 % (from lung tissue) of subjects with previous exposure to mineral particles had high lung retention of particles containing cerium. This study {{is believed to be the}} first one in which lung retention of cerium was estimated in the general population...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAdsorption {{tests were}} carried out in static mode, on natural {{phosphate}} samples both in a raw state and after processing. Various techniques of analyses were used (i) to characterize the material adsorbing on the granulo-chemical and thermo-mineralogical levels, (ii) to evaluate the performances {{of the process of}} adsorption used in relation to the existing <b>mineralogical</b> <b>species,</b> in phosphatic and gangue elements, (iii) to evaluate incubation condition in ions PO 43 -, carboxylate grouping and steric obstruction effect on lateral chains of adsorbates. This effect is significantly affected by the composition of the incubation medium. Thus, the fractions low in phosphate ions appeared definitely more effective. The adsorption isotherms highlight a good correlation between experimental points and values predicted by Temkin model, confirming the influence of interactive effects on the used adsorbates. Study of the mechanisms of adsorption and the transfer mode of matter was carried out using the linear shape of the isotherm models, their respective correlation coefficients, the speed constants and the diffusion coefficients for the kinetic models based on reaction and diffusion...|$|E
40|$|Liberation of {{valuable}} minerals from multiphase ores {{is one of}} the main goat of a size reduction process. Great importance is thus assumed by models able to give a detailed provisional description of the ore liberationcomminution process. In the definition of these models, the hypotheses usually adopted for ore textural and structural characterisation are dramatically simplified due to the great difficulty of translating and incorporating such characteristics in numerical form. This paper describes the possibilities offered by a full colour multispectral image analysis system for evaluating the liberation characteristics of an ore. The procedures and the related algorithms have been developed in order to permit a full recognition and morphological modelling of the different <b>mineralogical</b> <b>species</b> inside the images acquired by optical microscopy. A topological map containing a reduced body of data is related with the liberation characteristics of minerals. The system incorporates all the procedures able both to process the previously derived information and to test different comminution strategies based on the topological assessment of the species and the selected theoretical comminution net...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe SPectral Imager (SPIM) {{facility}} is a laboratory VIS-IR spectrometer developed to support spaceborne observations of rocky {{bodies of the}} solar system. Currently, this laboratory setup is used to support the Dawn NASA mission and to support the 2018 ExoMars mission in the spectral investigation of Martian subsurface. Specifically, for this mission, a selection of relevant Mars analogue materials has been characterized and stored in the International Space Analogue Rockstore (ISAR), hosted in Orléans, France. In this investigation, two volcanic rock samples from the ISAR collection were analyzed. These two samples were chosen because of their similarity in mineralogical composition and age with Martian basalts and volcanic sands. Moreover, volcanic sands are particularly interesting because they can contain fossils of primitive life forms. The analysis of data collected by SPIM resulted in good agreement with the mineralogical phases detected in these two samples by mineralogical and petrographical techniques, demonstrating {{the effectiveness of the}} high spatial and spectral resolution of SPIM for identifying and for mapping different <b>mineralogical</b> <b>species</b> on cut rock and mineral samples...|$|E
40|$|Orebodies at Ok Tedi {{contain a}} number of {{different}} fluorine bearing minerals. Some of these minerals report to concentrate and are responsible for the presence of the penalty element, fluorine, within the concentrate. Previous analytical work has tended to examine geological samples for content, rather than determine the metallurgical behaviour of the different <b>mineralogical</b> <b>species.</b> This investigation utilised X-Ray Diffraction combined with Scanning Electron Microscope/Electron Microprobe to identify the fluorine bearing minerals in flotation test products. Seven fluorine bearing minerals were identified, viz., talc, phlogopite, amphibole (tremolite and actinolite), sphene, apatite, biotite and clay. Talc was found exclusively in the skarn ore type. Phlogopite and amphiboles (tremolite and actinolite) were found to occur in both skarn and porphyry ores, while sphene, apatite, biotite and clay were found only in the porphyry ores. Of the fluorine bearing minerals observed, only talc exhibited natural hydrophobicity to any significant degree. Phlogopite and the amphibole minerals were found to be hydrophillic, whilst the remaining minerals occurred in insufficient quantities to determine the flotation behaviour. Ok Tedi copper concentrate fluorine content prior to skarn ore treatment in the mill (typically 350 ppm) was previously identified as deriving from phlogopite, while talc was believed to be the source of intermittent high concentrate fluorine contents when skarn ores were treated. This paper provides supporting evidence for this belief, and reports the nature of fluorine bearing mineral flotation behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The {{choice of}} {{suitable}} beneficiation strategies is strictly {{linked to the}} precise mineral-petrographic, textural and structural characterisation of the ore. Careful analysis and precise modelling of spatial relationships between different mineralogical phases constituting the ore {{is the basis of}} any procedure which aims at forecasting the separation results. The textural and structural characterisation of the ore on a macro/microscopic scale is carried out through optical microscopy and in some special cases by SEM analysis. The main purpose of these procedures is that of obtaining information which can be used in numeric form as data for the models. The traditional procedure consists of analysing sections under the microscope to obtain distribution maps for the different mineral phases and making a synthesis of these data {{so that they can be}} easily managed inside a numeric procedure. In the last few years the development of procedures based on techniques of optical image processing has greatly reduced the analysis time, allowing a better characterisation of the ore in textural and structural terms. The growing development of research in electronics and computer science and the subsequent availability of hardware and software products, allow handling and processing of full colour digital images, at lower and lower costs. In this paper the problems arising from the adoption of such a digital approach both in terms of quality of results (<b>mineralogical</b> <b>species</b> automatic identification) and in terms of further processing of the data (morphological and morphometrical characteristics and assessment of the mineral species constituting the ore), are described and discussed. © 1995...|$|E
40|$|Ore textural and {{structural}} characterizations play {{a fundamental role in}} any preliminary study (i. e. comminution, classification, separation) {{addressed to the}} design and set up of beneficiation flow sheets. The possibility to utilise automatic tools able to perform a classification, and a quantitative description, of the mineralogical and petrographical characteristics of raw ore samples thus represents an important step to define, to control and to verify the entire set of parameters, ore-texture-related, that can affect the final beneficiation results. The procedure usually adopted is based on the analysis of polished sections and more in details the recognition of the different <b>mineralogical</b> <b>species</b> and associations and the measurements of some quantitative parameters estimating both the geometrical characteristics of each species and the possible spatial relationships between them. This approach, originally carried out by experts, utilising optical and/or electronic microscopy, was “replaced” during the years by more and more sophisticated devices integrating analytical facilities and acquired data processing. Such integrated analytical devices formed the breakthrough platforms into what is now known as modern Process Mineralogy. In this paper the possibilities offered by chemical imaging based devices and techniques, specifically addressed to mineral phases, or rocks (i. e. gangue) recognition, is presented. Tests have been carried out and discussed in order to analyze the problems related to the development of suitable and low cost strategies addressed: i) to realize a full mapping of ore minerals/gangue inside selected samples, ii) to define the optimal data-flow handling to optimize the speed of processing versus the quality of the results and iii) to start to define logics and procedures finalized to implement innovative smart detection engines, HSI based, for mineral processing addressed to perform both a preliminary characterization of the ore, at laboratory scale, and a further possible control of the different processed minerals flow streams...|$|E
40|$|El Berrocal is an {{international}} research project on the natural radionuclide migration in a fissured granitic environment. This project is being {{carried out in the}} El Berrocal zone, north of the village of Nombela (Toledo). The gelogical formation studied is a granitic pluton with an epithermal vein-type mineralization comprising quartz, sphalerite, pyrite and chalcopyrite; and pitchblende, pyrite, carbonates and barite. The activities of the project are focused on the structural, lithological, geochemical, hydrochemical and hydrogeological aspects of the granite-U mineralization system, in order to establish a migration model of the natural radionuclides of the environment. The concurrence of the tectonic, hydrothermal and supergenic processes has originated several U remobilizations during the deuteric, hydrothermal and supergenic alteration phases, which affected the system. These phases are responsible of the <b>mineralogical</b> <b>species</b> and present distribution of this element within the system. The Th remobilization is much more limited, due to its different geochemical behavior. The present water-rock interaction processes account for the different types of water existing in the system, which are sulphatic, in the shallowest zones, and calcium bicarbonated in the deepest. The U contents in these waters vary from 1 to 100 ppb. The hydrogeology of the zone is controlled, at a local scale, by the topography and the fracture network, and the mineralized quartz dyke plays a major role on the groundwater flow. The isotopic analyses of the U and Th series in the infill materials seem to indicate recent sorption-desorption U processes and coprecipitation with carbonates. &# 194;&# 171;El Berrocal&# 194;&# 187;, es un proyecto internacional de investigaci&# 243;n sobre la migraci&# 243;n de radionucleidos naturales en un medio gran&# 237;tico fisurado.

Estas fases son las responsables de la mineralog&# 237;a y distribuci&# 243;n actual de dicho elemento en el sistema. La removilizaci&# 243;n del torio es mucho m&# 225;s restringida debido a su diferente comportamiento geoqu&# 237;mico.

Los contenidos en uranio en estas aguas est&# 225;n comprendidos entre 1 y 100 ppb.
