40|$|The {{identification}} of space debris based on radar measurements strongly {{depends on the}} ability of the orbiting object to reflect the electromagnetic waves irradiated by the transmitting station. A critical parameter describing the object electromagnetic behavior in a frequency band is the electromagnetic absorption cross section (ACS). At University "Sapienza" of Rome, a facility was established for space debris ACS measurements, by adapting the large Space Simulator once used for the San Marco satellites and available at the DIAEE (Department of Astronautics, Electrical and Energetics Engineering). The Space Simulator is a metallic cylinder of 3. 5 meter diameter and 3. 5 meter length, which is very well suited to obtain a large reverberation chamber (RC). This work presents measurements of electromagnetic absorption cross section (ACS) of space debris samples in the frequency range 500 MHz- 6 GHz by using the DIAEE reverberation chamber. The use of RC and vector network analyzer (VNA) allows to compute the ACS thanks to an homogeneous distribution of the electromagnetic field within the RC environment, where a <b>mechanical</b> rotating <b>stirrer</b> is also placed and tuned to increase the waves random propagation. Several materials have been characterized and compared, by analyzing samples of approximately same shape and dimensions.

Furthermore, the ACS of pure ice and water, {{as well as that of}} and aluminum, have been also measured and compared to the former results in order to evaluate the measurement set-up dynamic range when different materials scenarios are analyzed.

Said paint can be used in electromagnetic-shielding applications (for example, for producing radar-absorbent materials – RAMs) or else for producing antistatic devices or piezoresistive coatings for distributed monitoring of the state of strain of a structure. In addition to the aforesaid electrical, piezoresistive, and electromagnetic characteristics, the coats thus obtained are light, easy to process, and suitable for being laid on any substrate. All the purposes of the invention have been achieved through the process according to Claims 1 to 13. The process developed for producing said paint is simple, inexpensive, fast, and suitable for low-cost mass production. Moreover, it makes use of alcohol-water mixtures as solvent. It envisages the following steps: a) 	subjecting commercial graphite intercalation compound (GIC) to thermal expansion to obtain known structures such as TEGO, WEG, or expanded graphite (EG), or else using EG of a commercial type; b) 	dispersing and shredding said TEGO, WEG, or EG structures in water-based paint/ polymer possibly diluted with alcohol-water mixture, in variable concentrations according to the desired final properties; and c) 	subjecting the suspension to ultrasonication, wherein the parameters of the sonication cycle such as the temperature of the suspension, the energy released and the duration are defined {{on the basis of the}} properties of the material that is to be obtained.

The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of DMP is chlorine dioxide (CD) which is a potent oxidant and biocide. These properties have proved invaluable for various applications. The main goals of this study were: {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of DMP for disinfecting Mycobateria tuberculosis (TB) contaminated medical instruments, devices, floors and surfaces; to investigate the stability of DMP; and to explore possibilities for medical application of DMP. Evaluation of disinfectant activity of DMP on TB was performed using the spectrophotometric method, a modification of the European suspension test, EN 14348. M. bovis BCG was employed as surrogate in this test. Results were as follows: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC₉₀) = 12. 5 ppm; the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) = 15. 4 ppm; the Mycobactericidal Effect (ME) = 8. 8 log reduction; and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC₉₀) x minimum exposure time (CT) = 12. 5 ppm. s. The long term stability study of DMP was performed by monitoring the rate of degradation of DMP stored in the fridge (2 - 8 °C), in the oven (40 °C), and under ambient conditions (15 - 30 °C). Analytical methods of assessing DMP concentration was by Iodometric titration method. The shelf life of DMP stored in a transparent bottle at room temperature was 9. 8 weeks, as opposed to 52. 7 weeks when stored in an amber colored reagent bottle at the same temperature. Both oven samples had an expiry date of about 20 weeks and the fridge samples about 70 weeks. Foam formulations for a vaginal douche (VGD), mouth rinse (MRF), and foot/sit bubble bath (F/SBB) ], were developed in the laboratory. DMP and the formulated concentrate were designed to be mixed just prior to administration. During foam evaluation studies, a <b>mechanical</b> overhead <b>stirrer</b> was used to generate foam. Foamability was assessed by quantifying the amount of foam generated. The stability of foams were assessed by: 1) determining the rate of foam decay and the rate of foam drainage observed concurrently from foam loaded in a measuring cylinder; and 2) determining the life span of single bubbles of each foam system i. e. the bubble breaking time (BBT). The density of each foam system was also determined. Potentiometric acid base titration was used to select suitable adjuster alkali, and to show the benefits of employing a buffer. Concentrate development was initiated by a simple mixture of all the ingredients followed by stirring and observing the deviations from desired quality attributes of the product. The subsequent five processes were improvements designed to circumvent the shortcomings of the initial procedure to arrive at the optimized method E. Prototype formulations were employed to optimize excipient quantities to eventually arrive at an optimized master formula. In foam evaluation, it was found that sodium lauryl sulphate/ammonium lauryl sulphate/cocoamidopropyl betaine/cetostearyl alcohol (SLS/ALS/CAPB/CSA) foam system was the most appropriate to use in the formulation. NaOH was selected as the adjuster solution and KHP as the buffer. The dosage formula (DF) of the VGD and F/SBB was determined to be MDF = 5 ml of 50 ppm DMP + 5 ml concentrate + 40 ml water = 50 ml and that of MRF as MDF = 19 ml diluted concentrate + 1 ml of 50 ppm DMP. In conclusion, DMP was found to be a highly effective disinfectant against Mycobacteria. DMP has reasonable shelf life if stored appropriately.

40|$|Graphene {{nanostructures}} were synthesized by Hummer method. 1, 3, 5 and 7 wt% of graphene nanostructures {{were suspended}} in {{certain amount of}} acetone on a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stirrer</b> and stirred then added to epoxy resin. After 4 hours, solution and Graphene platelets (GPs) were prepared. Nanostructures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The electromagnetic interference shielding was studied by reflection loss (RL). According to the results, the multilayered graphene  3 % wt of has a completely smooth surface and its absorption average and maximum are reported as - 13. 5 dB and - 30. 3 dB...|$|E
30|$|In a 250 mL resin flask {{equipped}} with a high-torque <b>mechanical</b> <b>stirrer,</b> nitrogen inlet and outlet, as-received SWCNTs (1.0 g) and PPA (50 g, 83 % P 2 O 5 assay) were placed and stirred under dry nitrogen atmosphere at 130 °C for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature, water was added into the flask. Purified SWCNTs were precipitated as black powder and collected by suction filtration. The SWCNTs were Soxhlet-extracted with water for 3 days to completely remove any residual PPA, and then with methanol for three more days to remove any organo-soluble low molar mass impurities. Finally, the sample was freeze-dried under reduced pressure (0.5 mmHg) for 72 h.|$|E
