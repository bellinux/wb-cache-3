40|$|In estuarine ecosystem, sediments are {{not only}} {{functioning}} as heavy <b>metal</b> <b>scavenger,</b> but also as one of potential sources for heavy metals to the ecosystem. Due the capability of aquatic organisms to accumulate heavy metals, there is possibility of heavy metals to exert their toxic effect towards the organisms and other organisms positioned in higher trophic level, such as fish, and further to human beings. To understand the different processes of heavy metal bioaccumulation in a dynamic manner, a bioaccumulation model is required. Since bioaccumulation starts with the uptake of chemical across a biological membrane, the bioaccumulation model was constructed based on Biotic Ligand Model (BLM). The input for the model was determined from laboratory scale simulated estuarine ecosystem of  sediment-brackish water (seawater:Aquaâ 1 : 1) for determining the heavy metal fractions in sediments; simulated Oreochromis nilotycus - brackish water (fish-water) ecosystem for determining the rate constants; simulated fish-water-sediment ecosystem for evaluating the closeness between model-predicted and measured concentration, routes and distribution within specific internal organs. From these bioaccumulation studies, {{it was confirmed that}} the internalization of metals into the cells of gills and internal epithelias follows similar mechanisms, and governed mostly by the waterborne or hydrophilic heavy metals. The level of hydrophilic heavy metals are determined by desorption equilibrium coefficients, 1 /KD, and influenced by salinity. Physiologically, the essential Cu and Zn body burden in O. nilotycus are tightly homeostasis regulated, shown as decreasing uptake efficiency factor, EW, at higher exposure concentrations, while non essential Cd and Hg were less or not regulated. From the distribution within specific internal organs, it was revealed that carcass was more relevant in describing the bioaccumulation condition than liver. It is clear that every heavy metal has its own bioaccumulation dynamics, depend to the metal studied and environmental conditions, however the obtained parameters are applicable to bioaccumulation of Cd and Hg in natural estuarine ecosystem of Segara Anakan, Central Java.   Keywords: heavy metal, estuarine, bioaccumulation, model, dynamic...|$|E

40|$|Dispersion {{corrected}} density functional theory (DFT-D) {{has been applied}} to understand the performance of several palladium <b>metal</b> <b>scavengers.</b> Nine different sulfur-based ligands and three different palladium metal sets have been investigated in detail. Based on a thorough analysis of the thermodynamic binding parameters ΔH, ΔG and ΔS, we have identified the best binding modes for all scavenger ligands. Bis-monodentate coordination is favoured over chelation in ΔH and ΔG values for most of the scavenger ligands. Special {{attention has been paid to}} the ligand strain energies, which account for the structural changes of the ligands upon complexation indicating that small (5 -membered) chelates are considerably less favourable than expected. Some ligands can use their longest chain (> 7 -atoms) to yield trans chelates, which ligands with shorter chains (≤ 6 -atoms) are unable to form. A secondary amino nitrogen (RR′NH) is found to be the best donor with highest binding enthalpy for Pd(ii) metal systems. In terms of the strength of the initial binding interactions, -SMe > -SH; capping thiols (-SH) as thioethers (-SMe) is therefore suggested to be an effective strategy in scavenger design.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} {{understanding}} the heterogeneous/homogeneous {{nature of the}} catalytic species {{for a variety of}} immobilized metal precatalysts used for C-C coupling reactions. These precatalysts include: (i) tethered organometallic palladium pincer complexes, (ii) an encapsulated small molecule palladium complex in a polymer matrix, (iii) mercapto-modified mesoporous silica metalated with palladium acetate, and (iv) amino-functionalized mesoporous silicas metalated with Ni(II). As part of this investigation, the use of <b>metal</b> <b>scavengers</b> as selective poisons of homogeneous catalysis is introduced and investigated as a test for distinguishing heterogeneous from homogeneous catalysis. The premise of this test is that insoluble materials functionalized with metal binding sites can be used to selectively remove soluble metal, but will not interfere with catalysis from immobilized metal. In this way the test can definitely distinguish between surface and solution catalysis of immobilized metal precatalysts. This work investigates three different C-C coupling reactions catalyzed by the immobilized metal precatalysts mentioned above. These reactions include the Heck, Suzuki, and Kumada reactions. In all cases it is found that catalysis is solely from leached metal. Three different metal scavenging materials are presented as selective poisons {{that can be used to}} determine solution vs. surface catalysis.

30|$|In summary, carrier size is an {{important}} parameter but the best value to ensure maximum recoil retention {{is not necessarily the}} best value when optimising for therapeutic success since various parameters have to be balanced (McDevitt et al., 2001; Kim and Brechbiel, 2012). Important related aspects are the ease and flexibility of surface functionalisation in order to achieve stabilisation in physiological conditions as well as fast, high and persistent uptake in the target tissue. The use of radionuclides with a half-life of more than one week requires a sufficiently persistent retention in the target tissue for several half-lifes, ideally until complete decay is achieved. Radionuclides leaking out of the target tissue, whether individually or as nanoparticulate may cause off-target toxicity. Especially nanoparticles that may be recognized and stored in cells of the reticuloendothelial system, will deliver a large dose to organs of the reticuloendothelial system. In such cases biodegradable nanoparticles would be of advantage that release the radionuclides individually and would allow for accelerated excretion by additionally applying <b>metal</b> <b>scavengers</b> and diuretics (Jaggi et al., 2005) possibly supported by other measures to protect critical organs (cf. de Kruiff et al., 2015). The excretion of complete nanoparticles will most likely be slow as they will not pass renal clearance and may only be excreted following slow hepatobiliary pathways (Kreyling et al., 2017). However, in this context the approach of de Kruijff et al. (2017) could offer the possibility to achieve targeting with biodegradable polymeric nanocarriers which contain their radioactive load incorporated in a small nanoparticle inside the carrier. Provided this radioactive 'inner' nanoparticle is small enough to pass renal clearance, untargeted radiation might be excreted sufficiently fast before causing harm after degradation of the outer polymeric carrier shell. However, many physiological details need to be considered and mastered to make such a sophisticated approach a success.|$|R

Singlet oxygen quenching activity was examined using linoleic acid as substrate, containing 100 ppm erythrosine as a photosensitizer. The results showed that the membrane bound fractions had higher total phenolic compound, radical scavenging activity, ferrous ion-chelating ability and singlet oxygen quenching activity than cytoplasmic fractions (p 50 and metal chelating activity of aqueous fractions were 0. 270. 02 mg mL - 1 and 51. 536. 63 %, respectively and butanol fractions were 0. 330. 03 mg mL - 1 and 44. 753. 33 %, respectively. The butanol and aqueous fractions could act as SOQ at 75 ppm and 80 ppm, respectively. These results suggested that butanol and aqueous fractions were the most potent radical <b>scavenger,</b> <b>metal</b> chelator and singlet oxygen quencher...|$|R
40|$|Background Sun {{exposure}} {{is responsible for}} long-term clinical skin changes such as photoageing, photodamage and photocancers. Ultraviolet (UV) A wavelengths stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may contribute to photoageing. To protect against oxidative stress, skin cells have developed several defence systems, including ROS and <b>metal</b> ion <b>scavengers</b> and a battery of detoxifying, haem-degrading and repair enzymes. Melatonin's antioxidant activity {{is the result of}} three different but complementary actions: (i) a direct action due to its ability to act as a free radical scavenger; (ii) an indirect action that is a consequence of melatonin's ability to reduce free radical generation (radical avoidance); and (iii) its ability to upregulate antioxidant enzymes. Objectives In this study, we focused our attention on the prevention of photodamage, choosing melatonin as an antioxidant agent. Methods In the present study we analysed the effects of pretreatment of murine fibroblasts cells (NIH 3 T 3) with melatonin (1 mmol L- 1) followed by UVA irradiation (15 J cm- 2). Thereafter, changes in components of the extracellular matrix and in some antioxidant enzymes (inducible and constitutive haem oxygenase) were evaluated. Results We observed that UVA radiation caused altered expression of extracellular matrix proteins and induced the expression of inducible haem oxygenase. This increase was not sufficient to protect the cells from damage. Instead, melatonin pretreatment led to increased expression of haem-degrading enzymes and suppression of UVA-induced photodamage. Conclusions These results suggest that melatonin, as a modifier of the dermatoendocrine system, may have utility in reducing the effects of skin ageing. What's already known about this topic? Ultraviolet (UV) A radiation is responsible for skin induced-oxidative stress, photoageing, photodamage and photocancers. Melatonin might help to maintain a functional epidermal barrier and protect keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts against the damaging effects of UV radiation. What does this study add? Fibroblast haem oxygenase (HO) - 1 is upregulated after a short interval of UVA irradiation. Melatonin restores the physiological balance between synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix proteins via the induction of HO- 1 in murine fibroblasts irradiated with UVA...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{efficacy of}} anthracyclines (e. g., doxorubicin and daunorubicin) in cancer therapy {{is limited by}} their severe cardiotoxicity, the etiology of which is still not fully understood. The development of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy {{has been found to}} correlate with myocardial formation and accumulation of anthracycline secondary alcohol metabolites (e. g., doxorubicinol and daunorubicinol) that are produced by distinct cytosolic NADPH-dependent reductases. The aim of the current study is to identify chemical compounds capable of inhibiting myocardial reductases implied in anthracycline reductive metabolism in an attempt to decrease the production of cardiotoxic C- 13 alcohol metabolites. Among the variety of tested compounds (<b>metal</b> chelators, radical <b>scavengers,</b> antioxidants, β-blockers, nitrone spin traps, and lipid-lowering drugs), ebselen, cyclopentenone prostaglandins, nitric oxide donors, and short-chain coenzyme Q analogs resulted in being effective inhibitors of both doxorubicinol and daunorubicinol formation. In particular, ebselen (as well as ebselen diselenide, its storage form in the cells) was the most potent inhibitor of cardiotoxic anthracycline alcohol metabolites with 50 % inhibition of doxorubicinol formation at 0. 2 mol Eq of ebselen with respect to doxorubicin concentration. The high efficacy, together with its favorable pharmacological profile (low toxicity, lack of adverse effects, and metabolic stability) portends ebselen as a promising cardioprotective agent against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity...|$|R
