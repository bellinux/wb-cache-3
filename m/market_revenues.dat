50|$|The IT {{market is}} one of the most dynamic sectors of the Romanian economy. Since the year 1994 the IT market has {{demonstrated}} growth rates of 40-60 percent a year. The biggest sector in terms of revenue is system and network integration, which accounts for 28,3% of the total <b>market</b> <b>revenues.</b> Meanwhile, the fastest growing segment of the IT market is offshore programming. The industry of software development outsourcing crossed the mark of $3 billion of total revenues in 2005 and reached $4.8 billion in 2006. Currently Romania controls 5 percent of the offshore software development market and is the third leading country (after India and China) among software exporters. Such growth of software outsourcing in Romania is caused by a number of factors. One of them is the supporting role of the Romanian Government. The Government has launched a program promoting construction of IT-oriented technology parks - special zones that have an established infrastructure and enjoy a favorable tax and customs regime. Another factor stimulating the IT sector growth in Romania is the presence of global technology corporations such as Intel, Motorola, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Boeing, Nokia and others, which have intensified their software development activities and opened their R&D centers in Romania.|$|E

40|$|District heating (DH) {{represents}} a viable {{way to reduce}} CO 2 emissions associated with heat production. The market model for DH and specifically the introduction of wholesale competition for heat production on DH networks has been subject of discussion in North-Western Europe. This study aims to assess if the Marginal Pricing Mechanism (MPM), as used in liberalized “energy only” electricity markets, would be an adequate pricing mechanism for a such a market. It does so by addressing the concerns related to the under-recovery of fixed costs for producers when solely relying on the heat <b>market</b> <b>revenues.</b> This will be done by modelling a competitive wholesale DH market including multiple heat production technologies with a linear programming based model for {{a case study in}} the Netherlands. The model incorporates supply and demand for heat to obtain an hourly dispatch and heat market prices. Subsequently, the degree to which producers can recover their fixed cost with income from the heat <b>market</b> <b>revenues</b> is assessed. The results show that only a waste incineration plant can recover its fixed cost with heat <b>market</b> <b>revenues.</b> This suggests additional remuneration is required for the other producers to sustain such a market. The MPM could on the long run enable time-dependent pricing for end users of heat and offer the opportunity for demand side management. However, the results show that the maximum variability in end user prices amounts to 11 - 24 % for the residential sector and 22 - 48 % for the horticulture sector. Although, the actual observed price variation {{over the course of a}} day is considerably less, which diminishes the potential for demand side management. Nevertheless, it can be argued that the MPM ensures the most cost efficient dispatch by minimizing operational costs, given a certain generation mix. Finally, the analysis provides insight into issues that should be taken into account by policy makers when designing a market model for a competitive DH market...|$|E
