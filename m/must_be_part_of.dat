5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{political}} discussion has been about building a stadium, beginning in the 1990s when a Maryland location was chosen for what is now FedExField. With the possibility of building a new stadium in the near future, both the previous and current mayors of the District of Columbia have stated that a name change <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the discussion, however the team rejects that possibiltiy. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has met with the owner to discuss {{the building of a}} new stadium in Virginia. For many years, beginning with the departure of the Baltimore Colts, the Redskins were the only NFL team in a large area from Maryland into the southern states. This is slowly changing as Maryland NFL fans move to the Baltimore Ravens. Several Maryland politicians have stated that the name should change, but the current governor opposes any change, also citing the desire to keep the stadium in Maryland. Virginia fans are now the more numerous and dedicated supporters of the Redskins, and the state and local governments have used economic incentives to encourage the team's relocation of its facilities there, and maintain that the name is entirely a business decision for the team to make. An agency of the commonwealth, the Virginia Lottery, is a sponsor of the team, and says it has never had any complaints.|$|E

25|$|The UN Security Council {{established}} the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in 1994 following the Rwandan Genocide. Under the ICTR Statute, {{the link between}} crimes against humanity and an armed conflict of any kind was dropped. Rather, the requirement was added that the inhumane acts <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a “systematic or widespread attack against any civilian population on national, political, ethnic, racial or religious grounds.” Unlike {{the conflict in the}} former Yugoslavia, the conflict in Rwanda was deemed to be non-international, so crimes against humanity would likely not have been applicable if the nexus to armed conflict had been maintained.|$|E
25|$|Physics is {{the general}} {{analysis}} of nature, conducted {{in order to understand}} how the universe behaves. On the other hand, the study of meteorological weather patterns or human behavior is only of interest to humans themselves. The point is that having a perspective on the world is a psychological state. Therefore, the special sciences presuppose the existence of minds which can have these states. If one is to avoid ontological dualism, then the mind that has a perspective <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the physical reality to which it applies its perspective. If this is the case, then in order to perceive the physical world as psychological, the mind must have a perspective on the physical. This, in turn, presupposes the existence of mind.|$|E
25|$|Each team {{must have}} eight {{players in the}} scrum, unless for some reason (i.e. a sending-off or injury) they cannot field 15 players. Specialised front-row players (i.e. props and hookers) <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the scrum for safety reasons under the law. If a {{specialised}} player is not available, the scrum must have 'no weight', which means no player is allowed to push forward once the scrum commences. In cases where a front-row player is off the field due to a yellow card (compulsory 10 minutes off the field) or a red card (no longer allowed {{to participate in the}} game), a temporary substitution of another player is mandatory to ensure specialist front-row players participate in the scrum. If a team cannot field eight in the scrum, generally it drops the flankers or the number eight, but the props, hooker and locks must be maintained.|$|E

25|$|Alexander Orakhelashvili cites {{a number}} {{cases in which}} {{international}} tribunals have ruled that international organizations, including the Security Council, are bound by general international law. He says that inclusion of explicit clauses about the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and requiring respect of territorial integrity and sovereignty of a state demonstrates that the Council {{does not intend to}} offend peremptory norms in these specific ways. The resolution also acknowledges that these principles <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> an accepted settlement. That is confirmed by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which reiterates the prohibition on the use of force and provides that any settlement obtained by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations or conflicting with a peremptory norm of general international law is invalid. According to Hans-Paul Gasser, ‘doubtful’ wording of the Council’s resolutions must always be construed {{in such a way as}} to avoid conflict with fundamental international obligations.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{spent six}} weeks in the hospital, {{receiving}} marginal care in a dirty, wet environment. [...] A prolonged attempt to set the fractures on his right arm, done without anesthetic, was unsuccessful; he received an operation on his broken leg but no treatment for his broken left arm. [...] He was temporarily taken to a clean room and interviewed by a French journalist, François Chalais, whose report was carried on the French television program Panorama in January 1968 {{and later in the}} U.S. on the CBS Evening News. [...] The film footage of McCain lying in the bed, in a cast, smoking cigarettes and speaking haltingly, would {{become one of the most}} widely distributed images of McCain's imprisonment. [...] McCain was observed by a variety of North Vietnamese, including renowned Vietnamese writer Nguyễn Tuân and Defense Minister and Army commander-in-chief General Võ Nguyên Giáp. [...] Many of the North Vietnamese observers assumed that McCain <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> America's political-military-economic elite. [...] Now having lost fifty pounds (twenty-three kilograms), in a chest cast, covered in grime and eyes full of fever, and with his hair turned white, in early December 1967 McCain was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp on the outskirts of Hanoi nicknamed [...] "the Plantation". He was placed in a cell with George [...] "Bud" [...] Day, a badly injured and tortured Air Force pilot (later awarded the Medal of Honor) and Norris Overly, another Air Force pilot; they did not expect McCain to live another week. Overly, and subsequently Day, nursed McCain and kept him alive; Day later recalled that McCain had [...] "a fantastic will to live".|$|E
2500|$|To be {{entitled}} to prisoner-of-war status, captured persons must be lawful combatants entitled to combatant's privilege—which gives them immunity from punishment for crimes constituting lawful acts of war such as killing enemy combatants. To qualify under the Third Geneva Convention, a combatant <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a chain of command, wear a [...] "fixed distinctive marking, visible from a distance", bear arms openly, and have conducted military operations according to the laws and customs of war. (The Convention recognizes a few other groups as well, such as [...] "nhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on {{the approach of the}} enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units".) ...|$|E

This block is special comparing with other blocks because the winners <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> Public Safety/Private Partnership established by the FCC. Therefore, the winner's wireless network had to be good enough to meet public safety specifications for coverage and redundancy. Further, the winner could operate two public safety portions, 10 MHz, as a commercial network. Commercial traffic can also be carried over the public safety portion of the network so long as it is not being utilized.|$|R
2500|$|Since Darwin, Wallace and Bates did {{not hold}} {{teaching}} posts at any stage of their adult careers (and Műller never returned from Brazil) the imbalance in Huxley's program went uncorrected. It is surely strange that Huxley's courses did not contain {{an account of the}} evidence collected by those naturalists of life in the tropics; evidence which they had found so convincing, and which caused their views on evolution by natural selection to be so similar. Desmond suggests that [...] " [...] had to be simple, synthetic and assimilable [...] it was to train teachers and had no other heuristic function". That <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the reason; indeed it does help to explain the stultifying nature of much school biology.

2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Schopenhauer's {{notion of}} the will comes from the Kantian thing-in-itself, which Kant {{believed to be the}} fundamental reality behind the representation that provided the matter of perception, but lacked form. Kant believed that space, time, causation, and many other similar phenomena belonged properly to the form imposed on the world by the human mind in order to create the representation, and these factors were absent from the thing-in-itself. Schopenhauer pointed out that anything outside of time and space could not be differentiated, so the thing-in-itself must be one and all things that exist, including human beings, <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> this fundamental unity. [...] Our inner-experience must be a manifestation of the noumenal realm and the will is the inner kernel of every being. [...] All knowledge gained of objects is seen as self-referential, as we recognize the same will in other things as is inside us.|$|E
2500|$|From around 1920, he {{developed}} into an intensely Expressionist artist, moving from illustration to Symbolism. He was {{sympathetic to the}} Irish Republican cause, but not politically active. However, he believed that 'a painter <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the land and of the life he paints', and his own artistic development, as a Modernist and Expressionist, helped articulate a modern Dublin of the 20th century, partly by depicting specifically Irish subjects, but also by doing so {{in the light of}} universal themes such as the loneliness of the individual, and the universality of the plight of man. Samuel Beckett wrote that [...] "Yeats is with the great of our time... because he brings light, as only the great dare to bring light, to the issueless predicament of existence." [...] The Marxist art critic and author John Berger also paid tribute to Yeats from a [...] very different perspective, praising the artist as a [...] "great painter" [...] with a [...] "sense of the future, an awareness of the possibility of a world other than the one we know".|$|E

2500|$|Forests {{moderate}} the local climate {{and the global}} water cycle through their light reflectance (albedo) and evapotranspiration. They also conserve biodiversity, protect water quality, preserve soil and soil quality, provide fuel and pharmaceuticals, and purify the air. These free ecosystem services are not given a market value under most current economic systems, and so forest conservation has little appeal {{when compared with the}} economic benefits of logging and clearance which, through soil degradation and organic decomposition returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that about 90% of the carbon stored in land vegetation is locked up in trees and that they sequester about 50% more carbon than is present in the atmosphere. Changes in land use currently contribute about 20% of total global carbon emissions (heavily logged Indonesia and Brazil are a major source of emissions). Climate change can be mitigated by sequestering carbon in reafforestation schemes, plantations and timber products. Also wood biomass can be utilized as a renewable carbon-neutral fuel. The FAO has suggested that, over the period 2005–2050, effective use of tree planting could absorb about 10–20% of man-made emissions – so monitoring the condition of the world's forests <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a global strategy to mitigate emissions and protect ecosystem services. However, climate change may pre-empt this FAO scenario as a study by the International Union of Forest Research Organizations in 2009 concluded that the stress of a 2.5C (4.5F) temperature rise above pre-industrial levels could result in the release of vast amounts of carbon so the potential of forests to act as carbon [...] "sinks" [...] is [...] "at risk of being lost entirely".|$|E

60|$|He had {{not been}} so long out of college but the idea of this {{irregular}} supper, when he had once formed it, began to have its fascination. He took up the broad fire-shovel, and, by the time the boy had shuffled to and from the pantry beyond the dining-room, Bartley had cleaned the shovel with a piece of newspaper and was already heating it by the embers which he had raked out from under the pine-root. The boy silently transferred the half-pie he had brought from its plate to the shovel. He pulled up a chair and sat down to watch it. The pie began to steam and send out a savory odor; he himself, in thawing, emitted a stronger and stronger smell of stable. He was not without his disdain for the palate which must have its mince-pie warm at midnight,--nor without his respect for it, either. This fastidious taste <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the splendor which showed itself in Mr. Hubbard's city-cut clothes, and in his neck-scarfs and the perfection of his finger-nails and mustache. The boy had felt the original impression of these facts deepened rather than effaced by custom; they were for every day, and not, as he had at first conjectured, for some great occasion only.|$|E
