40|$|Selective {{breeding}} of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) receives a growing interest, as the estimated heritability of growth is medium to high. In this study, {{we compared the}} offspring of four groups of sea bass sires, mated with the same wild dams: wild (W), first generation of domestication (D), first generation of mass selection for length (M), first generation of PROSPER-like selection for length (P). The comparison was done both in replicated tanks (separate rearing) and in <b>mixed</b> <b>tanks</b> (<b>mixed</b> rearing) where sire origins were recovered by genotyping of eight microsatellite markers. Weight, length and growth rate were measured from day 238 post-fertilization (69 g mean weight) to day 611 post-fertilization (390 g mean weight). Both in <b>mixed</b> and separate <b>tanks,</b> both selected groups (P, M) were larger than unselected groups (W, D). No difference was seen at any time between W and D, nor between M and P. The selection response estimate on weight was larger in <b>mixed</b> <b>tanks</b> when compared to separate tanks (+ 42 % in <b>mixed</b> <b>tanks,</b> + 23 % in separate tanks at day 611), yielding realized heritability estimates of 0. 60 and 0. 34, respectively, and confirming the excellent potential of the species for growth improvement through selective breeding.

5000|$|Cecil Kelley was a 38-year-old {{chemical}} operator with 11 {{years of}} experience, {{more than half}} of those at the Los Alamos lab, where one of his duties was to operate a large (1000-liter capacity) stainless-steel <b>mixing</b> <b>tank.</b> The tank contained residual plutonium-239 remaining from other experiments and applications, along with various organic solvents and acids in an aqueous solution for the purpose of recovering it for reuse. In pure form and under normal temperature and pressure conditions, plutonium - a mostly man-made element existing in trace amounts in nature - is a solid silvery metal. It tarnishes quickly when exposed to air and readily dissolves in concentrated hydrochloric, hydroiodic, and perchloric acids, as well as others. On the day of the accident the <b>mixing</b> <b>tank</b> was supposed to contain what nuclear chemists call a [...] "lean" [...] concentration of dissolved plutonium (≤0.1 g of plutonium per liter of solution) in a bath of highly corrosive nitric acid and a caustic stabilized aqueous organic emulsion. However, {{as a result of what}} were later determined to be at least two [...] "improper transfers" [...] of plutonium waste to the tank (the sources for which were never determined or at least never publicly disclosed and about which Kelley had no reason to suspect nor ability to observe), the concentration of plutonium in the <b>mixing</b> <b>tank</b> on this particular occasion was nearly 200 times higher. Worse, it was also distributed unevenly: the upper layer of solution had especially high concentrations and contained a total of over 3 kg of plutonium, which was already close to criticality before Kelley acted. When Kelley switched on the mixer, a vortex began to form. The denser aqueous layer within the tank immediately pushed outward and upward forming a [...] "bowl", and the less dense plutonium-rich layer swirled toward the vessel's center.|$|E

40|$|Weed {{control in}} Florida citrus is {{primarily}} based on herbicides. Saflufenacil, a POST-applied herbicide is recently registered for broadleaf weed control in citrus. Saflufenacil has very limited grass activity; therefore, {{it should be}} <b>tank</b> <b>mixed</b> with graminicides or broad-spectrum herbicides to increase the spectrum of weed control. Greenhouse and field experiments were conducted at two locations (Polk County and Orange County, FL) to evaluate the efficacy and potential antagonism or synergy of saflufenacil and sethoxydim applied alone or <b>tank</b> <b>mixed,</b> and various two- and three-way mixes with glyphosate or pendimethalin.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{and analytical}} investigation is performed on a {{dissolved air flotation}} (DAF) pilot tank by using the residence time distribution (RTD) of the conservative dye rhodamine measured with a fluorometer. The experiments are numerically analyzed {{with regard to the}} total volume of the DAF tank separation zone in order to detect differences between observed separation zone flow structures in previous studies. The mean hydraulic detention time, the variance, and the estimated number of completely <b>mixed</b> <b>tanks</b> (N-cstr) in a series model are calculated. The variance is found to relate to the flow structure and the N-cstr is used for characterizing the occurrence of a stratified flow structure, which is beneficial for particle separation by DAF. The result shows a significant difference in RTD depending on expected flow structure. Analytically, a conceptual model is defined by dividing the DAF tank into an upper and a lower layer. In the upper layer, the water flow is horizontal and in the lower the water flow is vertical. The hypothesis is that mixing of the tracer takes place in the upper layer and that there is no significant mixing in the lower layer. Two simple mixing models are evaluated for the upper layer; the completely <b>mixed</b> <b>tanks</b> in series model, characterized by the number of tanks, and the dispersed plug flow model, characterized by the Peclet number. The models show good agreement with the experiments when the stratified flow structure is expected, but less agreement when the flow deviates from the stratified flow structure. The dispersed plug flow model shows the best fit with the experiments. The completely <b>mixed</b> <b>tanks</b> in series model is less sensitive, generating greater changes to the modeled RTD curve, which makes it more difficult to fit the model to the experiments...|$|R

40|$|The {{separation}} of binary and ternary mixtures is studied in one column chromatographs with recycle analogous to different SMB configurations (Analog). The very flexible basic {{design of the}} Analog consists of one column {{and a number of}} <b>mixed</b> <b>tanks</b> equal to the number of columns in the corresponding SMB. This design gives lower purities than the corresponding SMBs because of <b>mixing</b> in the <b>tanks.</b> For example, in {{separation of}} fructose-dextranT 6, the Analog to a one column per zone SMB at D/F = 4. 15, gave a purity index of 88. 4 opposed to the SMB 2 ̆ 7 s 97. 1. Mixing can be reduced and purities of the SMB approached by splitting the tanks into smaller tanks. For the dextran-fructose separation, the SMB purities were reached when each tank was divided into 7 smaller tanks. Analogs are designed for many SMB configurations. In some cases, tanks have to be split in order to retain the improvement produced by the more complicated operating procedures. For example, the tanks in the Analog to the 2 -feed SMB had to be split into 3 smaller tanks for it to perform better than the Analog to VARICOL. Analogs are also designed for a 5 -zone SMB and SMB cascades performing ternary separations. The purities are lower in the Analogs because of mixing, and splitting the tanks increases the purities. Analogs with <b>mixed</b> <b>tanks</b> are also designed for thermally assisted SMBs. ^ An unmixed tank is proposed as an alternative to splitting the <b>mixed</b> <b>tanks</b> similar to the system proposed by Mota and Araujo [9], except a constant volume tank is designed. These unmixed reservoirs increase the purity indices in the Analogs (for the separation of the binaphthol enantiomers at c F = 2. 9 g/l, PI increased from 89. 2 to 95. 1) with no increase in equipment or desorbent; however; the purities still do not match the SMB purities because of dispersion in the reservoir. Scaling rules are applied to first increase the purities by reducing the productivity, and are then applied to increase the productivity by allowing the system to operate at the maximum allowable pressure drop while keeping purities constant. ...|$|R
