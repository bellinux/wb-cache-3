25|$|Prior to Krugman's work, trade theory (see David Ricardo and Heckscher–Ohlin model) {{emphasized}} trade {{based on}} the comparative advantage of countries with very different characteristics, such as {{a country with a}} high agricultural productivity trading agricultural products for industrial products from a country with a high industrial productivity. However, in the 20th century, an ever-larger share of trade occurred between countries with similar characteristics, which is difficult to explain by comparative advantage. Krugman's explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the Journal of International Economics, and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors economies of scale. Consumers' preference for diversity explains the survival of different versions of cars like Volvo and BMW. However, because of economies of scale, it is not profitable to spread the production of Volvos all over the world; instead, it is concentrated in a few factories and therefore in a few countries (or <b>maybe</b> <b>just</b> one). This logic explains how each country may specialize in producing a few brands of any given type of product, instead of specializing in different types of products.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to instrumentation, Syro features several vocal tracks. Among them are edited [...] "unintelligible" [...] tracks of James, his wife Anastasia Rybina {{and his two}} sons, as well as both his mother and father, who appear on [...] "XMAS_EVET10". He recorded several additional [...] "poppy" [...] vocals of his parents—none of which were used on Syro—and stored [...] "entire sample packs of their voices" [...] during the process. On the album's overall sound, James said it's [...] " [...] pop album, or as poppy as it's going to get" [...] and [...] "pleasurable to listen to … <b>maybe</b> <b>just</b> the composition's changed, but there's no next-level beats on there". He attributed this change in style to the fact he no longer used computer-controlled percussion during Syros sessions.|$|E
500|$|The album {{title is}} rooted in the idea of [...] "yielding to nature," [...] a theme central to Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The band members read the book while working on the album. Regarding the title, McCready said, [...] "I think the title Yield has to do with maybe being more {{comfortable}} within ourselves, with this band....we're all a little bit older and a little more relaxed and <b>maybe</b> <b>just</b> kind of yielding to those anxieties and not trying to fight it so much...That's what it kind of feels to me– yielding, letting something else happen and going with it." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, {{and then you have to}} think, 'What are the real battles?' 'What's really important?' You get to a certain point, and it's really hard to remember what music is and to remember what drives you." ...|$|E
500|$|J. Broad {{wrote that}} the phrase [...] "have a nice day" [...] is an apt middle ground for the [...] "drop dead" [...] the cashier is {{thinking}} and the [...] "come back soon" [...] the owner wants. Broad stated that the phrase is meaningless {{because it has been}} castrated by excessive usage and pretense. He compared the phrase to the salutation [...] "How are you?" [...] and the phrase [...] "had a lovely time", which are [...] "conversational space-fillers" [...] that help prevent embarrassing silences. Usage of the term has been compared to inserting the phrase [...] "you know" [...] or the word [...] "like" [...] in sentences. In 1982, comedian George Carlin joked at Carnegie Hall, [...] "That's the trouble with 'Have a nice day'; it puts all the pressure on you. Now you've got to go out and somehow manage to have a good time, all because of some loose-lipped cashier. 'Have a nice day ...'

500|$|... "Your Love Is My Drug" [...] is a midtempo crunkcore and dance-pop song. The song {{combines}} heavy Auto-Tune that is {{layered with}} a heavy electronic backdrop. Kesha opens the track singing [...] "Maybe I need some rehab / Or <b>maybe</b> <b>just</b> need some sleep / I've got a sick obsession, I'm seeing it in my dreams" [...] while she depicts {{the tale of a}} teen love obsession. Her vocals throughout the song have been described as a shouty sing-speak style. Sara Anderson of AOL Radio called the song a [...] "bubblegum track" [...] that fuses elements of [...] "’80s glam rock", with [...] "Kesha's signature auto-tuned vocals and casual chatty ad-libs". Kesha ends the song saying [...] "Your love is my drug...I like your beard," [...] which was inspired by her ideal man. According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, the song is written in common time with a moderate beat rate of 120 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of F♯ major and Kesha's vocal range in the song spans from the note of C♯4 to the note of Eb5.|$|E
500|$|Musically, Animal {{is of the}} dance-pop and electro-pop genres, while {{incorporating}} {{elements of}} electro in its production and beats. Kesha's vocals uses Auto-Tune and vocoders to alter her voice and includes samples. David Jeffries of AllMusic noted that the album lyrically revolves around avoiding reality with a preference for a [...] "garbage chic" [...] life, with lyrics such as [...] "Maybe I need some rehab, or <b>maybe</b> <b>just</b> need some sleep" [...] from the opening song [...] "Your Love Is My Drug". Lyrically, {{the majority of the}} album's songs are based on Kesha's past life experiences of love, heartbreak, boys, and having a good time. [...] "Your Love Is My Drug" [...] is a dance song that is layered with a heavy electronic backdrop. Her vocals throughout the song have been described as a shouty sing-speak style. Musically, the song uses a simple, upbeat lyric line. On [...] "Tik Tok" [...] Kesha uses a spoken word rap style on the verses while the chorus is sung. According to her the lyrics are representative of herself, stating [...] "it's about my life, it's 100 per cent me". [...] "Take It Off" [...] has been described as [...] "a heavily Auto-Tuned reworking" [...] of [...] "There's a Place in France".|$|E
500|$|Cleve Jones {{played a}} major role in the {{investigation}} of the riots, and had since become a prominent activist. He dropped out of school to work as a legislative consultant to California State Assembly Speakers Leo McCarthy and Willie Brown. He also spent time organizing political campaigns. In 1981, while working as a consultant to the California State Assembly Health Committee, he became aware of gay men in San Francisco contracting unusual diseases, such as Kaposi's sarcoma. The gay community was eventually seriously affected by the AIDS epidemic, and Jones became a key AIDS activist. Jones co-founded the Kaposi's Sarcoma Research & Education Foundation, which in 1982 became the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. On November 27, 1985, at a candlelight vigil on the anniversary of the Moscone-Milk assassinations, Jones learned that 1,000 people had died of AIDS. He proposed the creation of a quilt, in remembrance of those who had died. In 1987, Jones, by then HIV-positive himself, launched the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt. As of 2009, the quilt consists of over 44,000 individual panels. In a 2004 interview, Jones said [...] "I thought, what a perfect symbol; what a warm, comforting, middle-class, middle-American, traditional-family-values symbol to attach to this disease that's killing homosexuals and IV drug users and Haitian immigrants, and <b>maybe,</b> <b>just</b> maybe, we could apply those traditional family values to my family." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{origins of}} the episode and the {{character}} of Patrick began when Robert Downey, Jr. telephoned the show production staff {{and asked if he}} could produce or assist in an episode creation, as his son is a fan of the show, so the producers came up with the character of Patrick for Downey. Show producer Seth MacFarlane believes Downey [...] "did a great job," [...] and brought a [...] "very kind of half crazy, and <b>maybe</b> <b>just</b> eccentric personality to that character that really worked out great." [...] When Patrick makes his second appearance in season 10's [...] "Killer Queen", he is not voiced by Downey. Instead, he is voiced by Family Guy writer, and recurring guest voice actor, Danny Smith. Bob Barker voiced himself presenting The Price Is Right; but the actual sequence took years to make. Barker has provided his voice for the show twice, although MacFarlane has never met him. John Veiner voiced Bobby McFerrin falling down a flight of stairs. The ball-in-a-cup scene is commented upon by MacFarlane, where he states that [...] "the voice-overs work, the drawings work" [...] and that Walter Murphy [...] "did a great job of creating a piece of deliberately annoying music." [...] Several jokes had been pitched for Peter's words after killing an evil dragon, but all were dropped, as they weren't deemed funny enough by production staff.|$|E
500|$|Benfica's first {{competitive}} match hosted Copenhagen on 14 August in {{the third}} qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League. Santos was confident in a win due to his familiarity with Copenhagen's style, since Benfica had played them twice in the past tournament. In the match, Rui Costa scored two long-range goals for a 2–1 win. Santos was pleased, despite Copenhagen's goal disconcerting his team. The next day, Benfica accepted an offer for Manuel Fernandes from Everton. His departure troubled Santos, since Fernandes had been a growing influence on the team during the pre-season. On 18 August, Benfica began their Primeira Liga campaign against Leixões. Without the injured Luisão or Ángel Di María, the club lost their first points in a 1–1 draw after a 94th-minute equaliser. The slip had an immediate impact, with club president Luís Filipe Vieira sacking Santos two games into the season. Santos, caught off guard, said, [...] "I am not hurt, <b>maybe</b> <b>just</b> surprised". Benfica immediately signed José Antonio Camacho, who had managed the team from 2002 to 2004, to replace him. Camacho was happy to return, acknowledging that his friendship with Vieira {{played an important role}} in his quick hiring. In his first game, Camacho could not lead Benfica past Vitória de Guimarães, who earned a scoreless draw at Estádio da Luz. Benfica signed more players: Uruguayans Maxi Pereira and Cristian Rodríguez first, followed by Brazilian centre-back Edcarlos. In the last match of August, Benfica confirmed their place in the group stage of the Champions League with an away win in Parken Stadium. The next day, the club was drawn into group D alongside Milan, Celtic and Shakhtar Donetsk.|$|E
500|$|Carl Swanson of New York {{magazine}} was {{amazed by the}} ArtRave, from the Volantis display to the actual party area, and added that [...] " [...] event, mostly staged for Gaga's cameras {{as well as those}} of the feverishly Instagramming guests, was surprisingly well organized for something so manifestly difficult. The idea was clearly to be in control of it." [...] However, he noticed a bit of [...] "vulnerability" [...] in Gaga as she performed onstage. Swanson relegated Gaga's lectures about Koons and their collaboration as [...] "borderline gibberish", adding that: [...] "It's less of a collaboration than a feeling that she is searching to attach herself to something bigger than herself, something less evanescent than pop, or <b>maybe</b> <b>just</b> something to contain herself before she flames out completely, like a hashtag in the wind." [...] Kia Makarechi of The Huffington Post was critical of the set up when Gaga had to wade through a crowd to reach the stage, but wrote that [...] "nce Gaga took the stage, however, all was nearly forgotten. The singer worked through the new album with an impressive commitment to weirdness." [...] Nick Murray of Spin magazine criticized the [...] "underwhelming display" [...] of Volantis and found that Gaga's ideas about [...] "changing the world" [...] with the album and the technology were [...] "both dry and ridiculous, vaguely utopian but overly confident in the liberating power of technology, and just when the whole thing was beginning to seem more and more like a farce, [...] cannily explained that beyond whether the Volantis is ever mass-produced, 'the important thing is about the possibilities'." ...|$|E

500|$|In a June 2017 {{interview}} with Ultimate Guitar, Gary Holt {{said that he}} is ready to contribute with the songwriting for the next album. When speaking to Revolver, King was asked if there were any plans in place for the band to begin working on the album, he said, [...] "Funny thing is, Repentless isn't even two years old yet, though it seems like it is. But from that session, there are six or eight songs that are recorded — some with vocals, some with leads, but all with keeper guitar, drums and bass. So when those songs get finished lyrically, if the lyrics don't change the songs, they'll be ready to be on the next record. So we already have more than half a record complete, if those songs make it." [...] He also gave conceivable consideration that it could be released next year, [...] "I'm certainly not gonna promise it, because every time I do, I make a liar of myself! [...] " [...] When asked about any plans or the timeline the band would like to release the album, King said, [...] "It depends on touring — getting time to rehearse, getting time to make up new stuff. We haven't even done Australia on this run yet at all. We're hitting Japan finally later this year. But if things go well, I'd like to record next year. But timelines change all the time." [...] In an October 2017 interview, Holt once again expressed his desire to contribute to the songwriting for the next Slayer album, saying, [...] "When that time comes and we are ready for the next album, if Kerry wants me to contribute, I've got riffs. I've got stuff right now that I've written that I am not using for Exodus, because it was kind of <b>maybe</b> <b>just</b> unintentional subconscious thing, like, 'It sounds a little too Slayer.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Slezak of TVLine complimented [...] "Max Adler's {{surprisingly}} nuanced performance" [...] as Karofsky in [...] "Born This Way": [...] "The complex play {{of emotions}} in Karofsky's eyes when Santana simultaneously {{came out to}} him, threatened to out him, predicted his sad future as a closeted state senator or deacon, and offered him a quick-fix solution by pretending to be his beard, was tremendous." [...] He added, [...] "Adler is bringing a terrific amount of depth to Karofsky." [...] VanDerWerff referred to Karofsky's parallel journey with Santana, who is also closeted, in his comments about the episode {{and the next one}} where the character appears, [...] "Prom Queen". He said in his review of the latter, [...] "the characters I'm most interested in at this point are Karofsky and Santana. They're both people {{trying to do the right}} thing, but they're also both people who are defeated by their own weakest impulses. ... They're both hemmed in by the decisions they've made and their inability to be true to themselves". Meghan Brown of The Atlantic praised Karofsky's [...] "tearful apology to Kurt" [...] in that episode as being [...] "painful and poignant", and Slezak went further: Whatever awards Chris Colfer and Max Adler get nominated for in the next six months, they earned 'em during this conversation, where Kurt wondered if <b>maybe,</b> <b>just</b> maybe, he wasn't getting bullied because kids were indifferent to him being gay, not because Karofsky was serving as his security detail. ... ou could see in Kurt's eyes the decision to start treating Karofsky not as a former tormentor, but as a terrified kid struggling with his sexual orientation. And Karofsky's break—his first true apology for bullying Kurt, and his first tentative step toward admitting the root cause of his anger—had me reaching for the Kleenex. Tell me I'm not the only one hoping Glee will keep journeying down Karofsky's difficult road toward self-acceptance.|$|E
500|$|... "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] was lauded {{by music}} critics. Parisien called the song [...] "a year-long banger", complimenting its {{instrumentation}} and melody. Steve Morse, editor of The Boston Globe, wrote that Carey sang {{with a lot}} of soul. According to Barry Schwartz from Stylus Magazine, [...] "to say this song is an instant classic somehow doesn't capture its amazingicity; it's a modern standard: joyous, exhilarating, loud, with even a hint of longing." [...] Schwartz praised the song's lyrics as well, describing them as [...] "beautifully phrased," [...] and calling Carey's voice [...] "gorgeous" [...] and [...] "sincere." [...] Kyle Anderson from MTV labeled the track [...] "a majestic anthem full of chimes, sleigh bells, doo-wop flourishes, sweeping strings {{and one of the most}} dynamic and clean vocal performances of Carey's career". While reviewing the 2009 remix version, Becky Bain from Idolator called the song a [...] "timeless classic" [...] and wrote, [...] "We love the original song to pieces—we blast it while decorating our Christmas tree and lighting our Menorah." [...] In his review for Carey's Merry Christmas II You, Thomas Connor from the Chicago Sun-Times called the song [...] "a simple, well-crafted chestnut and one of the last great additions to the Christmas pop canon". Shona Craven of Scotland's The Herald, said, [...] " [...] a song of optimism and joy that <b>maybe,</b> <b>just</b> maybe, hints at the real meaning of Christmas." [...] Additionally, she felt the main reason it was so successful is the subject [...] "you" [...] in the lyrics, explaining, [...] "Perhaps what makes the song such a huge hit is the fact that it's for absolutely everyone." [...] Craven opened her review with a bold statement: [...] "Bing Crosby may well be turning in his grave, but no child of the 1980s will be surprised to see Mariah Carey's sublime All I Want For Christmas Is You bounding up the charts after being named the nation's top festive song." [...] In a 2006 retrospective look at Carey's career, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker said, the [...] "charming" [...] song was one of Carey's biggest accomplishments, calling it [...] "one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon". Dan Hancox, editor of The National, quoted and agreed with Jones' statement, calling the song [...] "perfection". In 2010, Rolling Stone ranked [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list, calling it a [...] "holiday standard." ...|$|E
