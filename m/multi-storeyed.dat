25|$|The most {{impressive}} and colossal {{of the building}} complexes measures 110 m by 100 m in size and is {{commonly referred to as}} 'the palace'. This structure follows the same form as the domestic architecture seen elsewhere in Zubarah, but on a much larger scale. Nine interconnected compounds, each comprising a courtyard surrounded by a range of rooms, made up the interior of this structure. Plaster stucco decoration was used to embellish internal entrances and rooms. The discovery of internal staircases indicates that the compounds were <b>multi-storeyed.</b> The nine compounds of the complex were enclosed by a high circuit wall with circular towers at the four corners, each of which were capable of supporting a small cannon. The size and visual dominance of the palatial compound suggests that it was occupied by a family of wealthy and powerful sheikhs who were community leaders in the social and economic life of the town.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} Roman amphitheatres {{date from}} the middle of the first century BC, but most were built under Imperial rule, from the Augustan period (27 BC–14 AD) onwards. Imperial amphitheatres were built throughout the Roman empire; the largest could accommodate 40,000–60,000 spectators, and the most elaborate featured <b>multi-storeyed,</b> arcaded façades and were elaborately decorated with marble, stucco and statuary. After the end of gladiatorial games in the 5th century and of animal killings in the 6th, most amphitheatres fell into disrepair, and their materials were mined or recycled. Some were razed, and others [...] converted into fortifications. A few continued as convenient open meeting places; in some of these, churches were sited.|$|E
2500|$|Gwalior {{has three}} {{shopping}} malls, DD City Mall with Fun Cinemas multiplex, Maya-Gitanjali Mall with Gold Digital Multiplex and the Central Mall. Salasar Mall City Centre, similarly to DD City Mall, {{also contains a}} multiplex.

[...] "Sun City Amusement Park" [...] is a family entertainment centre in Gwalior. The DD City Mall {{is one of the}} biggest malls of Madhya Pradesh. A <b>multi-storeyed</b> structure, it houses shops and showrooms of many national and international brands and has a number of eateries, as well as a Fun Cinemas multiplex. There are also some international and well known fast food restaurants like Domino's Pizza, Subway (restaurant) and McDonald's in DD City Mall. Pizza Hut is adjacent to DD Mall.|$|E
2500|$|Houses built within medieval {{cities were}} {{restricted}} in space, often {{by the fact}} that the town was encircled by walls. As a response to this, houses in cities were usually <b>multi-storeyed.</b> The simplest of these buildings were extremely cramped for space, having just a single room on each floor, accessible only by steep ladder-like stairs. In some cases exterior staircases gave onto wooden balconies which served the upper floors of a whole row of tall narrow houses, as is evidenced by the rows of holes and supporting corbels that are found in the walls of a great many Italian medieval buildings. Likewise, small inner courts which provided light and air were communal spaces for surrounding buildings. They also provided for the collection of rainwater. Narrow <b>multi-storeyed</b> houses of the Romanesque period have survived in a number of cities, with the greatest number occurring in Italy, where they are generally built of stone or brick and have often been extended at later dates, or had their Romanesque openings altered, making them indistinguishable from later medieval buildings. Casa Dante, thought to have been the home of Dante Alighieri, in Florence, is a good surviving example. In Germany the Baumburg Tower in Regensburg is an elegant late 13th-century example showing elements that are transitional between Romanesque and Gothic in its decorative window openings which are different on each floor, and contrast with the smoothly stuccoed walls. Another house, at Karden, has similar features but in form combines a tower house and a hall. The extremes of tall city housing are found in San Gimignano and Bologna where families rivaled each other in the construction of very tall tower houses. In Bologna only the Torre Garisenda, [...] (1100), 130ft and the Torre Asinelli, (1109), 225ft, have survived, but the much smaller walled hill-town of San Gimignano contains fourteen tower and the stumps of very many more, having once bristled with them. It has been suggested that the tall houses of this city served the practical purpose of suspending bolts of cloth for drying, in the shade rather than in the sun.|$|E
