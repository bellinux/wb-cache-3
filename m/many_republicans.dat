5|$|Matlock {{drew the}} ire of <b>many</b> <b>Republicans</b> during the 2004 Presidential {{election}} when he signed the Diplomats and Military Commanders for Change Official Statement of June 16, 2004, criticizing the policies of George W. Bush and endorsing John Kerry for President.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{was one of}} the few leading Republicans not {{blamed for}} the {{disastrous}} results, and he sought to build on that in the 1966 congressional elections. He campaigned for <b>many</b> <b>Republicans</b> seeking to regain seats lost in the Johnson landslide and received credit for helping the Republicans make major gains in the midterm election.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} term, Cleveland {{successfully}} nominated two justices to the Supreme Court of the United States. The first, Lucius Q.C. Lamar, {{was a former}} Mississippi Senator who served in Cleveland's Cabinet as Interior Secretary. When William Burnham Woods died, Cleveland nominated Lamar to his seat in late 1887. While Lamar had been well liked as a Senator, his service under the Confederacy two decades earlier caused <b>many</b> <b>Republicans</b> to vote against him. Lamar's nomination was confirmed by the narrow margin of 32 to 28.|$|E

5|$|Sampson {{established}} his legal practice in Barbourville, {{where he became}} the city attorney. Caleb Powers, who had been Sampson's college roommate, now joined him {{as a partner in}} his law firm. Powers would later be accused of complicity to the assassination of Governor William Goebel. Because Powers was convicted by a partisan jury, he became a political martyr to <b>many</b> <b>Republicans,</b> and Sampson's connection to him became a boon in heavily Republican eastern Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{convened in}} Chicago and {{nominated}} former Speaker of the House James G. Blaine of Maine for {{president on the}} fourth ballot. Blaine's nomination alienated <b>many</b> <b>Republicans</b> who viewed Blaine as ambitious and immoral. The GOP standard bearer was weakened by alienating the Mugwumps, and the Conkling faction, recently disenfranchised by President Arthur. Democratic party leaders saw the Republicans' choice {{as an opportunity to}} win the White House {{for the first time since}} 1856 if the right candidate could be found.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Roosevelt {{backed the}} Hepburn Bill, {{imposing}} railroad regulation. <b>Many</b> <b>Republicans</b> initially {{wanted nothing to}} do with the bill, and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich entrusted management of the bill to Tillman. Aldrich hoped the outspoken South Carolinian would cause the defeat of the bill. To Aldrich's surprise, Tillman soberly and competently conducted the bill through much of the legislative process. Tillman withdrew from the bill (though he voted for it) after Roosevelt got a provision for federal court review of agency decisions included, which Tillman opposed. The president and the southern senator ended on worse terms than before, but there was great public attention on the Hepburn Bill, and Tillman gained considerable respect for his role.|$|E

5|$|At the 1968 Republican National Convention, Agnew, who {{had earlier}} {{been asked to}} place Richard Nixon's name in nomination, was {{selected}} as running mate by Nixon and his campaign staff. Agnew's centrist reputation interested Nixon, and the law and order stance he had taken {{in the wake of}} civil unrest that year appealed to aides such as Pat Buchanan. Agnew made a number of gaffes during the campaign, but his rhetoric pleased <b>many</b> <b>Republicans,</b> and he may have made the difference in several key states. Nixon and Agnew defeated the Democratic ticket, incumbent vice president, Hubert Humphrey for president, and his running mate, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie. As vice president, Agnew was often called upon to attack the administration's enemies. In the years of his vice presidency, Agnew moved to the right, appealing to conservatives who were suspicious of moderate stances taken by Nixon. In 1972, Nixon and Agnew were reelected for a second term, defeating Senator George McGovern of South Dakota and former ambassador Sargent Shriver of Maryland.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{plagued by}} {{political}} missteps and personal scandals, {{the administration of}} Republican Acting Governor of Massachusetts Jane Swift appeared vulnerable, and <b>many</b> <b>Republicans</b> viewed her as unable to win a general election. Prominent party figures– {{as well as the}} White House– wanted Romney to run for governor and the opportunity appealed to him for reasons including its national visibility. A poll by the Boston Herald showed Republicans favoring Romney over Swift by more than 50percentage points. On March 19, 2002, Swift announced she would not seek her party's nomination, and hours later Romney declared his candidacy, for which he would face no opposition in the primary. In June 2002, the Massachusetts Democratic Party challenged Romney's eligibility to run for governor, noting that state law required seven years' consecutive residence and that Romney had filed his state tax returns as a Utah resident in 1999 and 2000. In response, the bipartisan Massachusetts State Ballot Law Commission unanimously ruled that he had maintained sufficient financial and personal ties to Massachusetts and was, therefore, an eligible candidate.|$|E
5|$|McEwen {{won four}} of the five {{counties}} in the district — Adams, Brown, Clermont and Warren. In Adams, once part of his district, he received 77% of the vote, sixty-seven points ahead of Portman. However, McEwen finished third in the largest county in the district, Hamilton, one he had never represented and which contained 57% of the Second District's registered voters. In the primary, Portman won only Hamilton County, but by a large enough margin to win the primary with 17,531 votes (35.61%), while McEwen received 14,542 (29.54%), Buchert 12,488 (25.37%), Dorsey 2,947 (5.99%), the rest scattering. The race in the Second District, one of the most Republican in the country, was determined in the primary — six times as <b>many</b> <b>Republicans</b> as Democrats voted in the primary — and Portman easily defeated attorney Lee Hornberger 53,020 (70.1%) to 22,652 (29.1%) in the special election on May 4.|$|E

5|$|President Harrison {{had proven}} unpopular; there were {{divisions}} {{even within the}} Republican party as the year 1892 began and Harrison began his re-election drive. Although no declared candidate opposed Harrison, <b>many</b> <b>Republicans</b> were ready to dump the President from the ticket if an alternative emerged. Among the possible candidates spoken of were McKinley, Reed, and the aging Blaine. Fearing that the Ohio governor would emerge as a candidate, Harrison's managers arranged for McKinley to be permanent chairman of the convention in Minneapolis, requiring him to play a public, neutral role. Hanna established an unofficial McKinley headquarters near the convention hall, though no active {{effort was made to}} convert delegates to McKinley's cause. McKinley objected to delegate votes being cast for him; nevertheless he finished third, behind the renominated Harrison, and behind Blaine, who had sent word {{he did not want to}} be considered. Although McKinley campaigned loyally for the Republican ticket, Harrison was defeated by former President Cleveland in the November election. In the wake of Cleveland's victory, McKinley was seen by some as the likely Republican candidate in 1896.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{began to}} gain {{prominence}} in the small Democratic caucus by opposing Reconstruction measures. His delaying tactics against fellow Pennsylvanian Thaddeus Stevens's military Reconstruction bill in February 1867 kept the bill from being considered for two weeks—long enough {{to prevent it from}} being voted on until the next session. He likewise spoke against what would become the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Although he opposed the amendment, Randall did favor the idea behind part of it: section 4, which guarantees that Congress may not repudiate the federal debt, nor may it assume debts of the Confederacy, nor debt that the individual Confederate states incurred during the rebellion. <b>Many</b> <b>Republicans</b> claimed that if the Democrats were to regain power, they would do exactly that, repudiating federal debt and assuming that of the rebels. Despite disagreement on other facets of Reconstruction, Randall stood firmly with the Republicans (and most Northern Democrats) on the debt.|$|E
25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{during the}} Presidency of Barack Obama had opposed the then-current president's new {{environmental}} regulations, {{such as those}} on carbon emissions from coal. In particular, <b>many</b> <b>Republicans</b> support building the Keystone Pipeline, which is supported by businesses but opposed by indigenous peoples' groups and environmental activists.|$|E

50|$|While the Democratic Party, {{the representatives}} of moderate, {{progressive}} republican politics in the Cambodian political milieu, were effectively incorporated into the Sangkum in 1957, <b>many</b> <b>republican</b> moderates simply avoided politics altogether until the period immediately after 1970.|$|R

25|$|Modern Republicans {{advocate}} {{the theory of}} supply side economics, which holds that lower tax rates increase economic growth. <b>Many</b> <b>Republicans</b> oppose higher tax rates for higher earners, which they believe are unfairly targeted at those who create jobs and wealth.
