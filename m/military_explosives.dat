25|$|An improvised {{explosive}} device (IED), {{also known as a}} roadside bomb, is a homemade bomb constructed and deployed in ways other than in conventional military action. It may be constructed of conventional <b>military</b> <b>explosives,</b> such as an artillery round, attached to a detonating mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} {{has been}} used for creating organic peroxide-based explosives, such as acetone peroxide, for improvised explosive devices. Hydrogen peroxide itself also acts as an explosive in high concentrations when placed in an absorbent, and {{has been used}} in attacks including the 7 July 2005 London bombings. These explosives tend to degrade quickly and hence are not used as commercial or <b>military</b> <b>explosives.</b>|$|E

In what was claimed by a Kuwaiti newspaper to be a response ordered by Iran, Hezbollah set off an explosive device {{on the border between}} Lebanon and the Israeli-controlled side of the Shebaa farms, wounding two Israeli soldiers. Israel responded with artillery fire toward two Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon.|$|E

25|$|She was {{chartered}} {{to carry}} a complete cargo of miscellaneous types of <b>military</b> <b>explosives</b> from New York to France in November 1917. Mont-Blanc was not an especially old vessel but was a relatively slow, common, three-island type tramp steamer, typical of many wartime freighters. She left New York December 1 to join a convoy in Halifax, Nova Scotia. She arrived from New York late on 5 December, {{under the command of}} Aimé Le Medec. The vessel was fully loaded with the explosives TNT and picric acid, the high-octane fuel benzole, and guncotton. She intended to join a slow convoy gathering in Bedford Basin readying to depart for Europe, but was too late to enter the harbour before the nets were raised. Ships carrying dangerous cargo were not allowed into the harbour before the war, but the risks posed by German submarines had resulted in a relaxation of regulations.|$|E
500|$|Alfred Nobel (...) {{was born}} on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm, Sweden, into a family of engineers. He was a chemist, engineer, and inventor. In 1894, Nobel {{purchased}} the Bofors iron and steel mill, which he made into a major armaments manufacturer. Nobel also invented ballistite. This invention was a precursor to many smokeless <b>military</b> <b>explosives,</b> especially the British smokeless powder cordite. As a consequence of his patent claims, Nobel was eventually involved in a patent infringement lawsuit over cordite. Nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime, with most of his wealth from his 355inventions, of which dynamite is the most famous.|$|E

2500|$|Captain Karl Friesenhahn was the {{technical}} or bridge commander and {{in charge of}} the demolition charges. He had earlier requested [...] of <b>military</b> <b>explosives,</b> but at 11:00 am on 7 March he received only half the amount requested, [...] Worse, he found he been sent [...] "Donarit", a much weaker ammonium nitrate-based industrial explosive used in mining. With no other option, he placed all [...] on the eastern pier of the bridge. At 2:00 pm, as the first elements of the U.S. forces came close to the western approach, he detonated a charge under the stone archway that connected the approach embankment with the bridge, blowing a [...] crater in the road bed, hoping it would slow down tanks and infantry. Scheller and Bratge entered the railroad tunnel where the electric switch controlling the detonators was located. Friesenhahn followed them, but before he could get to the tunnel, the concussion from an exploding shell knocked him unconscious. He regained his senses 15 minutes later and continued towards the tunnel. Bratge yelled at Friesenhahn to blow up the bridge. Friesenhahn replied they had to get the order in writing from Scheller, who was {{at the other end of}} the [...] tunnel that curved at almost 90° under Erpeler Ley. Bratge ran to find Scheller, got the order in writing, and when he returned to tell Friesenhahn to detonate the charges, Friesenhahn in turn required Bratge to give him the order in writing.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{increase}} in tourism, coal decreased in importance. However, shortly after the Second World War a ponderous industrialization effort was commenced, the so-called [...] "Piani di Rinascita" [...] (Rebirth Plans), with the initiation of major infrastructure projects on the island. [...] This included the realization of new dams and roads, reforestation, agricultural zones on reclaimed marsh land, and large industrial complexes (primarily oil refineries and related petrochemical operations). These efforts to create jobs have largely failed due to {{the high costs of}} transportation that could not compensate the cheap labor. In the 1950s and 1960s many Sardinians migrated to Northern and Central Italy (Lombardy, Piedmont, Liguria, Tuscany and Rome) and the rest of Europe (mostly in Germany, France and Belgium) but also from the interior of the island to the coastal cities of Cagliari, Olbia and Sassari. In the early 1960s with the creation of petrochemical industries, thousands of ex-farmers became specialised workers, and some others would commence to work on the newly established military bases, created primarily for the NATO. Even now, around 60% of all Italian and US military installations in Italy are on Sardinia, whose area is less than one-tenth of all the Italian territory and whose population is little more than the 2,5%; furthermore, they comprise over 35.000 hectares used for experimental weapons testing, where 80% of the <b>military</b> <b>explosives</b> in Italy are used. Ever since, {{there has always been a}} local protest movement expressing deep concern over the environmental degradation the military activities would cause.|$|E
