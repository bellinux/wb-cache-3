Thus not having to invest any valuable resources, the queen can then use these resources on reproducing a new brood.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{it is not}} only males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, {{although}} most females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, adolescent lions, both male and female, may be evicted.|$|E
5|$|Members of Picidae are {{typically}} monogamous, {{with a few}} species breeding cooperatively and some polygamy reported in a few species. Polyandry, where a female raises two broods with two separate males, has also {{been reported in the}} West Indian woodpecker. Another unusual social system is that of the acorn woodpecker, which is a polygynandrous cooperative breeder where groups of up to 12 individuals breed and help to raise the young. Young birds from previous years may stay behind to help raise the group's young, and studies have found reproductive success for the group goes up with group size, but individual success goes down. Birds <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to remain in groups {{due to a lack of}} habitat to disperse to.|$|E

5|$|Nursing lasts six {{to eight}} months in Californian populations and four to twelve months in Alaska, with the mother {{beginning}} to offer bits of prey at one to two months. The milk from a sea otter's two abdominal nipples is rich in fat and more similar to the milk of other marine mammals than {{to that of other}} mustelids. A pup, with guidance from its mother, practices swimming and diving for several weeks before it is able to reach the sea floor. Initially, the objects it retrieves are of little food value, such as brightly colored starfish and pebbles. Juveniles are typically independent at {{six to eight}} months, but a mother <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to abandon a pup if she cannot find enough food for it; at the other extreme, a pup may nurse until it is almost adult size. Pup mortality is high, particularly during an individual's first winter– by one estimate, only 25% of pups survive their first year. Pups born to experienced mothers have the highest survival rates.|$|E

Wedges are typically used in pairs, on opposite sides of the wagon so that the wagon can't slip off the wedges.|$|E
25|$|Capital flight {{can cause}} {{liquidity}} crises in directly affected countries {{and can cause}} related difficulties in other countries involved in international commerce such as shipping and finance. Asset holders <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> into distress sales.

Typically, during a liquidity crisis, the interbank lending market stalls.|$|E

The back-up will also be called upon to start some games to give the starter the opportunity to rest from game-play during the season.|$|E
25|$|In the West, sex before {{marriage}} is not illegal. There are social taboos and many religions condemn pre-marital sex. In many Muslim countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, Oman, Mauritania, United Arab Emirates, Sudan, Yemen, {{any form of}} sexual activity outside marriage is illegal. Those found guilty, especially women, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to wed the sexual partner, publicly beaten, or stoned to death. In many African and native tribes, sexual activity is not viewed as a privilege or right of a married couple, but rather as the unification of bodies and is thus not frowned upon.|$|E
25|$|However {{the power}} that a prime {{minister}} has over his or her cabinet colleagues is directly proportional {{to the amount of}} support that they have with their political parties and this is often related to whether the party considers them to be an electoral asset or liability. Also when a party is divided into factions a Prime Minister <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to include other powerful party members in the Cabinet for party political cohesion. The Prime Minister's personal power is also curtailed if their party is in a power-sharing arrangement, or a formal coalition with another party (as happened in the coalition government of 2010 to 2015).|$|E

Antonio wrote to Gil that the junta should continue as it had been, but Murat demanded to preside over it. Most of the members accepted this on May 4, but Gil did not. He turned in his resignation a few days later.|$|R
50|$|Many hens {{confined}} to battery cages, and some raised in cage-free conditions, are debeaked {{to prevent them}} from harming each other and cannibalism. According to critics of the practice, this can cause hens severe pain to the point where some may refuse to eat and starve to death. Some hens <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>force</b> molted to increase egg quality and production level after the molting. Molting can be induced by extended feed withdrawal, water withdrawal or controlled lighting programs.|$|R

25|$|Like other volcanoes {{around the}} Pacific Ocean, Mayon {{is a part}} of the Pacific Ring of Fire. It is on the {{southeast}} side of Luzon, close to the Philippine Trench, which is the convergent boundary where the Philippine Sea Plate is driven under the Philippine Mobile Belt. When a continental plate meets an oceanic plate, the lighter and thicker continental material overrides the thinner and heavier oceanic plate, forcing it down into the Earth's mantle and melting it. Superheated magma and gases <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> through weaknesses in the continental crust caused by the subduction of the oceanic plate, and one such exit point is Mayon.|$|E
25|$|California's {{state budget}} woes are {{expected}} to put more pressure on cities such as Burbank. State lawmakers have proposed eliminating the individual redevelopment agencies, {{a move that would}} force cities such as Burbank to eliminate much needed infrastructure projects. Local redevelopment agencies also <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to reimburse the state. For example, Burbank Redevelopment Agency might have pay the state nearly $20 million. But the city is fighting the return of at least $15 million in redevelopment funds, including money that was slated for the Lundigan Community Center and improvements to Johnny Carson Park. Whether Burbank will ultimately prevail is unclear, as the state's budget hole is getting worse due to the slow economy and lower than expected state revenues.|$|E
25|$|Much {{research}} has been done on the foraging behavior of the red harvester ant. Three types of workers are most involved in the foraging process: nest patrollers, trail patrollers, and foragers. On a given day, nest patrollers emerge first from the nest to assess the safety and profitability of foraging. The colony gets the majority of its water from the metabolism of the fats in seeds. If food is scarce, or if it is a particularly hot day, the energy and water benefits of foraging may be outweighed by its energy and water costs. In this case, the colony <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to rely on its extensive food stores. Seeds may be stored in the nest for months or even several years.|$|E
40|$|Australian {{political}} parties have to date functioned very much as private bodies, but public demand <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>forcing</b> them to <b>be</b> more directly accountable for their activities than could once have been envisaged. The Queensland Parliament has been prepared to make an attempt in 2002, and this might well {{turn out to be}} a watershed for {{political parties}} in this country, according to Scott Bennett, for once such changes are made in one Australian jurisdiction, it can be difficult to withstand calls for change in others...|$|R

30|$|In {{the current}} debate, it {{is worthy of}} mention that as a {{consequence}} of ‘innovation by coercion’, there has been a certain change in industry’s perception of its academic partner. In some cases, the policy <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>forcing</b> companies to see R&D collaborations more as a help rather than as a hindrance. It is hoped that such a vision will become more of a reality at a time in the future when both partners in academic-industrial relations are able to cultivate joint R&D practices and effect productive ‘dancing moves’ in relation to each other.|$|R
