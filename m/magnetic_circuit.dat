25|$|By {{use of a}} {{permanent}} magnet in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>circuit,</b> a relay {{can be made to}} respond to current in one direction differently from in another. Such polarized relays are used on direct-current circuits to detect, for example, reverse current into a generator. These relays can be made bistable, maintaining a contact closed with no coil current and requiring reverse current to reset. For AC circuits, the principle is extended with a polarizing winding connected to a reference voltage source.|$|E
25|$|Thermal <b>magnetic</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers, {{which are}} the type found in most {{distribution}} boards, incorporate both techniques with the electromagnet responding instantaneously to large surges in current (short circuits) and the bimetallic strip responding to less extreme but longer-term over-current conditions. The thermal portion of the circuit breaker provides a time response feature, that trips the circuit breaker sooner for larger overcurrents but allows smaller overloads to persist for a longer time. This allows short current spikes such as are produced when a motor or other non-resistive load is switched on. With very large over-currents during a short-circuit, the magnetic element trips the circuit breaker with no intentional additional delay.|$|E

A [...] "shorting ring", or Faraday loop, may be included as a thin copper cap fitted over the pole tip or as a heavy ring situated within the magnet-pole cavity. The benefits of this complication is reduced impedance at high frequencies, providing extended treble output, reduced harmonic distortion, and a reduction in the inductance modulation that typically accompanies large voice coil excursions. On the other hand, the copper cap requires a wider voice-coil gap, with increased magnetic reluctance; this reduces available flux, requiring a larger magnet for equivalent performance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – In the {{analysis}} of <b>magnetic</b> <b>circuits,</b> reluctances are commonly modeled as resistances and magnetomotive forces modeled as electromotive forces. In this way the magnetic flux and flux density can be determined easily. However, a close examination should reveal that it is fundamentally wrong to use a resistance, which is a lossy component, to model reluctance, which is a lossless component. This confusion may result in serious problems in {{the analysis}} and computer simulation of mixed electric and <b>magnetic</b> <b>circuits.</b> The gyrator approach of modeling can resolve the problem. However, due to the unwillingness of electrical engineers to accept the term gyrator, {{it has never been}} widely used. In this paper we propose to revitalize the gyrator model and to further develop it into a z-parameter model. Since z-parameters are well-defined parameters of the 2 -port networks, engineers/students in the electrical engineering discipline should find the z-parameter model much easier to understand and to manipulate. In addition, we also propose some strategies to introduce the z-parameter model of <b>magnetic</b> <b>circuits</b> into the curriculum of electrical engineering courses...|$|R
