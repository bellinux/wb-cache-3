5|$|From {{a purely}} {{literary}} and historical point of view, Either/Or {{can be seen}} as a thinly veiled autobiography of the events between Kierkegaard and his ex-fianceé Regine Olsen. Johannes the Seducer in The Diary of a Seducer treats the object of his affection, Cordelia, much as Kierkegaard treats Regine: befriending her family, asking her to marry him, and breaking off the engagement. Either/Or, then, could be the poetic and literary expression of Kierkegaard's decision between a life of sensual pleasure, as he had experienced in his youth, or a possibility of marriage and what social responsibilities marriage <b>might</b> <b>or</b> ought to entail. Ultimately however, Either/Or stands philosophically independent of its relation to Kierkegaard's life.|$|E
5|$|It {{was found}} that Choor Singh had two private {{contacts}} with a material witness {{in the course of}} the disciplinary proceedings, even though it is a well-established rule that a decision-maker should not have contact with any party to the proceedings or any of his witnesses in the absence of the other party or his counsel. The High Court found that there was no actual bias, but there was evidence on which reasonable people might believe that Choor Singh <b>might</b> <b>or</b> could not bring an unprejudiced mind to the disciplinary inquiry. The key finding was that the two private contacts with the material witness gave an appearance of a real likelihood of bias. On this basis, the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the disciplinary committee. The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath (1992).|$|E

25|$|Human {{prehistory}} in Southeastern Europe is conventionally {{divided into}} smaller periods, such as Upper Paleolithic, Holocene Mesolithic/Epipaleolithic, Neolithic Revolution, expansion of Proto-Indo-Europeans, and Protohistory. The changes between these are gradual. For example, depending on interpretation, protohistory <b>might</b> <b>or</b> might not include Bronze Age Greece (2800–1200 BC), Minoan, Mycenaean, Thracian and Venetic cultures. By one {{interpretation of the}} historiography criterion, Southeastern Europe enters protohistory only with Homer (See also Historicity of the Iliad, and Geography of the Odyssey). At any rate, the period ends before Herodotus in the 5th century BC.|$|E
25|$|Gap {{insurance}} {{covers the}} excess amount on your auto loan in an instance where {{your insurance company}} does not cover the entire loan. Depending on the company's specific policies it <b>might</b> <b>or</b> might not cover the deductible as well. This coverage is marketed for those who put low down payments, have high interest rates on their loans, and those with 60-month or longer terms. Gap insurance is typically offered by a finance company when the vehicle owner purchases their vehicle, but many auto insurance companies offer this coverage to consumers as well.|$|E
25|$|While a principle-based {{approach}} might {{claim that}} lying is always morally wrong, the casuist would argue that, {{depending upon the}} details of the case, lying <b>might</b> <b>or</b> might not be illegal or unethical. The casuist might conclude that a person is wrong to lie in legal testimony under oath, but might argue that lying actually is the best moral choice if the lie saves a life. (Thomas Sanchez and others thus theorized a doctrine of mental reservation, which developed into its own branch of casuistry.) For the casuist, the circumstances of a case are essential for evaluating the proper response.|$|E

25|$|Urs, Tenor, {{most likely}} a Heldentenor. As its name implies, the heldentenor vocal fach {{features}} in the German romantic operatic repertoire. The heldentenor is the German equivalent of the tenore drammatico, however with a more baritonal quality. Therefore, the heldentenor voice <b>might</b> <b>or</b> might not have facility up to high B or C. The repertoire, however, rarely calls for such high notes. This seems to be evident in Il Divo's repertoire: {{the extent of his}} range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he can sing from G2 up to C5. However, Buhler himself once revealed from a video chat with fans that he could sing from C2 up to G5.|$|E
25|$|Both Suther and Régine Tessier, {{the latter}} in a sketch of Sage in Notable American Women: The Modern Period, note key {{features}} of Sage’s mature work. Most of Sage’s paintings focus on free-standing architectural structures, including walls, towers, and latticework, which could represent buildings either under construction or ruined and decaying. Some contain figures that <b>might</b> <b>or</b> might not be human, hidden by flowing drapery. (Le Passage, one of Sage’s last paintings, is perhaps the only one containing a definite human figure; even Small Portrait, thought {{by many to be}} a self-portrait, is hardly recognizable as a face.) Like Tanguy, Sage often sets her objects on deserts or plains that recede to immeasurably distant horizons. She renders her forms in meticulous, photographic detail, using a gray-green-ochre palette that Tessier describes as “reminiscent of the sulphurous light before a thunderstorm”. Critics frequently called Sage’s work disturbing or depressing, even when they praised her painterly skill.|$|E
25|$|In 1803, the Supreme Court {{established}} {{judicial review}} of federal legislation in Marbury v. Madison, holding, however, that Congress could not grant unconstitutional power to the Court itself. The Constitution does not explicitly state that the courts may exercise judicial review; however, the notion that courts could declare laws unconstitutional was envisioned by the founding fathers. Alexander Hamilton, for example, mentioned and expounded upon the doctrine in Federalist No. 78. Originalists on the Supreme Court have argued that if the constitution does not say something explicitly it is unconstitutional to infer what it should, <b>might</b> <b>or</b> could have said. Judicial review means that the Supreme Court can nullify a congressional law. It is a huge check by the courts on the legislative authority and limits congressional power substantially. In 1857, for example, the Supreme Court struck down provisions of a congressional act of 1820 in its Dred Scott decision. At the same time, the Supreme Court can extend congressional power through its constitutional interpretations.|$|E

Hyde is aware of Emma's life behind bars and tests her {{to see if she}} is in fear even if she is in denial and makes his point when her hand started shaking. Hyde gives Emma the answer and he tells her to follow a red bird. Later that night, Emma takes the advice after she sees one during the search for survivors, and it leads Emma to The Oracle, a young girl who gives Emma a vision of her future as The Savior, which reveals a confrontation with an unknown attacker who plans to kill Emma as she was defending her family; The Oracle also hints of many paths Emma could take but the outcome <b>might</b> <b>or</b> might not change. When Emma returns to confront Hyde about this, he explain that the person she'll face in the future will be her ending but given his previous encounters with those that came before her, he tells Emma that the enemy is among the residents, so Emma decides for her family's sake to keep this to herself.|$|E

Before he reached his ship he had sworn a solemn oath: he vowed that he would follow that pirate ship; he would kill, burn, destroy, annihilate, but out of the storm and the fire he would pick unharmed the father of the girl who had entranced him and had spurned him. He laughed savagely as he thought of it. With that dolt of a father in his hands, a man wearing always around his neck the hangman's noose, he would hold the card which would give him the game. What Mistress Kate Bonnet <b>might</b> say <b>or</b> do; what she <b>might</b> like <b>or</b> <b>might</b> not like; what her ideas about honour <b>might</b> be <b>or</b> <b>might</b> not be, {{it would be a very}} different thing when he, her imperious lover, should hold the end of that noose in his hand.

500|$|However, modern {{translations}} make {{it clear}} that Laing was using the nursery rhyme as a model for his very free translation, and the reference to London Bridge does not appear {{at the start of the}} verse and it is unlikely that this is an earlier version of the nursery rhyme. Some historians have raised the possibility that the attack never took place. However, the original document detailing the attack was written only about 100 years after what would be a famous event in a highly populated area, leading the majority of historians to conclude that the account is at least relatively accurate. While it <b>might</b> <b>or</b> might not be the origin of the rhyme, this would make King Olaf's victory the only historically recorded incidence of london bridge [...] "falling down." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{hearing of}} the Dutch show of force, {{aboriginal}} tribes from further afield decided to submit to Dutch rule, either through fear of Dutch military <b>might</b> <b>or</b> hope that such an alliance would prove beneficial to the tribe. Representatives came from Pangsoia (Pangsoya; modern-day Linbian, Pingtung), 100km to the south, to ally themselves with the VOC. The Dutch decided to hold a landdag (a grand convention) to welcome all the villages into the fold and impress them with Dutch largesse and power. This duly took place on 22 February 1636, with 28 villages represented from southern and central Formosa. The governor presented the attendees with robes and staffs of state to symbolise their position, and Robert Junius wrote that [...] "it was delightful to see the friendliness of these people when they {{met for the first}} time, to notice how they kissed each other and gazed at one another. Such a thing had never before been witnessed in this country, as one tribe was nearly always waging war against another." ...|$|E

It has also been agreed upon that a proper script is required, as it is {{not a part of the}} [...] "commercial field" [...] of cinema. However, no official confirmations have been made regarding the sequel, despite requests from many viewers. After the IIFA ceremony, Farhan Akhtar commented that there was [...] "no necessity" [...] for the sequel. Later in 2013, in an interview with Hindustan Times, Zoya Akhtar expressed interest in scripting for the sequel after completing the shooting of her next film Dil Dhadakne Do released in June 2015.|$|E
