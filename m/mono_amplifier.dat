50|$|Following {{the mass}} {{production}} of 'stereo' vinyl records in 1958, the QC 22 control unit {{was developed and}} released in 1959. This was a stereo control unit {{that was designed to}} be used with a pair of QUAD II <b>mono</b> power <b>amplifiers.</b> To complement the QUAD II, the company also produced AM and FM tuners for use with the QC II & 22 control units.|$|R
50|$|The string set up of {{the guitar}} is 1 bass string, 3 wound guitar strings for the chords and a cluster of 3 unwound strings tuned off-key unison, causing a rapid {{vibrating}} tone. Each group of strings has its own individual output for three amplifiers to preserve tonal interference. The sound simulates three musicians at once; a bass player, a rhythm guitarist and a solo guitarist or a Greek electric bouzouki. The instrument also is fitted with a so-called tailed bridge (as on a Fender Jaguar) to increase overtone possibilities. The electronics contain switches to change the 3-way system to stereo or <b>mono</b> if fewer <b>amplifiers</b> are available.|$|R
50|$|Tehkan Gridiron Fight {{used two}} Z80C 8-bit CPUs at 4.608 MHz for processing. For sound, it {{employed}} one Z80C at 4.6 MHz, two AY-3-8910s at 1.536 MHz and one M5205 at 384 kHz for FM and samples. Although this produced three-channel music plus sound effects, all sound was fed through a <b>mono</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{in the cabinet}} housing. As machines aged the amplifier was known to fail, resulting in silent gameplay.|$|E
50|$|Tehkan World Cup uses two Zilog Z80C 8-bit CPU {{microprocessors}} at 4.608 MHz {{clock rate}} for processing. For sound, it employs one Z80C at 4.608 MHz, two General Instrument AY-3-8910 sound chips at 1.536 MHz for PSG music, and one Oki MSM5205 at 384 kHz for ADPCM samples at 12-bit depth and 32.088 kHz sampling rate. This produces six-channel PSG music, plus PCM samples from 32 kB audio ROM. However, all sound is fed through a <b>mono</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{in the cabinet}} housing. As machines age, the amplifier is known to fail, sometimes resulting in silent gameplay.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, Jack Herschorn {{purchased}} the Universal Audio mixing console {{and a number}} of other pieces of equipment from that studio including UA LA-76A and LA-76B limiting amplifiers, UA vacuum tube power amplifiers (which were actually Dynakit Stereo 70 and 50-watt <b>mono</b> <b>amplifier</b> kits assembled into rack-mount chassis), Fairchild Conax sibilance controllers, Langevin graphic equalizers and Cinema Engineering filters, all originally installed in United Studio A in 1957. This equipment was shipped to Vancouver, Canada, and installed in Aragon Studios which he owned at the time, later renamed Mushroom Studios. Installation of the equipment in Vancouver was supervised by Charlie Richmond.|$|E
5000|$|A smaller tube amplifier, the 17.5wpc Stereo 35, was {{introduced}} in 1963, and was followed the next year by the SCA 35, the company's first integrated (preamp + power amp) tube amplifier. In 1992, {{an updated version of}} the Stereo 70, the Stereo 70 II, was produced by Sound Valves for Panor Corporation. Even today, upgraded components, rebuilding kits, and complete tube amplifiers using the basic Stereo 70 design are still in production, and the ST 70 has inspired numerous other amplifier designs, such as Ars-Sonum's Filarmonia SE. Dynaco continued to build both <b>mono</b> and stereo <b>amplifiers</b> until 1977. The company's final contribution to vacuum tube technology was the massive Mk. VI <b>mono</b> power <b>amplifier</b> of 1976, which produced 120 watts (continuous). [...] In later years, the company began to produce a line of solid-state audio components, commencing in 1966 with the introduction of the Stereo 120 power amplifier (60 wpc). Because of early problems involving circuit, power supply, and transistor failures, the ST 120 was not as popular as earlier Dynaco tube amplifiers. Numerous small circuit changes were introduced by Dynaco over the years in an attempt to improve the stability and reliability of the ST 120, without much success. With the PAT-4 preamplifier in 1967, the company affirmed its ability to design reliable solid state equipment at an affordable price. In the 1970s, the Stereo 400 was developed and marketed. This was a high power amplifier at 200 watts per channel that offered automatic protection circuitry to prevent electrical destruction of the loudspeaker. The FM-5 tuner was offered as was the SCA-80 integrated amplifier in the early 1970s time line. There was also the Dynaquad system which allowed the user to simulate a quadrophonic sound by using out of phase signals at the speaker terminals. It apparently was a success and offered good four-channel sound at budget price. Dynaco's solid-state kits were different from the popular Heathkit products (and Dynaco's own vacuum tube kits) because of their preassembled circuit boards. These boards were wired at the factory, tested and packaged with the unassembled chassis. It remained only for the consumer to attach the switches and controls to the chassis pieces, assemble the chassis and power supply, and solder connecting wires to the circuit boards. This saved considerable time and reduced error in assembly.|$|R
40|$|NCP 2830 is a cost {{effective}} <b>mono</b> audio power <b>amplifier</b> designed for portable communication device {{applications such as}} mobile phones. Due to its integrated charge pump structure, this part is capable of delivering 1 W of continuous average power to an 8. 0 � Bridge Tied Load no matter the voltage provided by a lithium/Ion battery. NCP 2830 is a preferred solution for long playback audio with minimum space required. Added to a fast start−up time of 200 �s and a − 88 dB PSRR, the NCP 2830 audio power amplifier is specifically designed to provide high quality and level output power from low supply voltage, requiring very few external components. Features • 1 W to 8 � load for VDD from 2. 7 V up to 5. 5 V • High quality audio (THD+N = 0. 04 %) • Low noise: SNR up to 100 dB • Very Fast Turn On Time: 200 �s • Overall system efficiency optimization: up to 89...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the same}} era (late 1970s) PS Audio {{introduced}} its first power amplifier, the Model One, a solid state design producing 70 watts per channel into 8 Ohms and 140 watts per channel into 4 Ohms. The design {{was a classic}} AB amplifier design featuring the company's first full 19" [...] chassis design, large power supply, low feedback and minimalist design constraints. The Model One was later followed with the world's first Audiophile integrated amplifier introduced by an American High-End company, the Elite. Based on the Model One architecture, the Elite integrated the Linear Control Center into a Model One amplifier chassis. The Model One {{was replaced by the}} Model II, moving back to a smaller modular chassis approach at 8.5" [...] with faceplate. The Model II produced 40 watts per channel into 8 Ohms, 70 watts per channel into 4 Ohms and had a Bridging switch enabling the user to bridge the internal stereo amplifiers into one <b>mono</b> <b>amplifier,</b> producing 160 watts into 4 Ohms. The Model II was followed by the IIC, featuring the same circuitry placed into a standard 19" [...] rack mount chassis. The IIC introduced a new concept to the Audiophile marketplace, use of a separate external power supply for an amplifier. Users could choose from two models of external power supply, one as standard and an upgrade to a larger High Current version. The concept of an external power supply was first introduced on the PS Audio IV preamplifier and later applied to power amplifiers like the IIC. The concept became known as the High Current Power Supply or HCPS and was popular because improvements to the sound quality were gained by moving to a larger power supply, both in the application of the preamplifier as well as power amplifiers. The model IIC is factory rated at 55 watts into 8 ohms and 200 watts bridged mode (400 watts into 4 ohms bridged). The IIC Plus is rated at 70 watts into 8 ohms. Amplifier successors to the IIC included the 250 Delta monoblock and the 100 Delta amplifier.|$|E
