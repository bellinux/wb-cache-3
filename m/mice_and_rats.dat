[URL] The species cross-reactivity of the monoclonal antibodies infliximab, bevacizumab, and an anti-VEGF-B antibody, 2 H 10, {{in humans}} and rodents was determined. METHODS: The binding of infliximab to human, <b>mouse,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> TNF-α, of bevacizumab to human, <b>mouse,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> VEGF-A, <b>and</b> of the 2 H 10 antibody to human, <b>mouse,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> VEGF-B was evaluated by ELISA. The sequence of human, <b>mouse,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> TNF-α <b>and</b> VEGF-A at the binding sites for infliximab and bevacizumab were compared. RESULTS: Infliximab bound to human TNF-α, but no binding to mouse or rat TNF-α was detected between 10 pg/mL and 10 μg/ml. Sequence {{comparison of the}} binding site revealed four changes in <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> five in <b>rat</b> TNF-α compared with human. Bevacizumab bound strongly to human VEGF-A, but showed 5 -log weaker binding to both <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> VEGF-A.

40|$|Mammalian carboxylesterase (CES or Ces) genes encode {{enzymes that}} {{participate}} in xenobiotic, drug, and lipid metabolism {{in the body}} and are members of at least five gene families. Tandem duplications have added more genes for some families, particularly for <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> genomes, which has caused confusion in naming rodent Ces genes. This article describes a new nomenclature system for human, <b>mouse,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> carboxylesterase genes that identifies homolog gene families and allocates a unique name for each gene. The guidelines of human, <b>mouse,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> gene nomenclature committees were followed and "CES" (human) <b>and</b> "Ces" (<b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> <b>rat)</b> root symbols were used followed by the family number (e. g., human CES 1). Where multiple genes were identified for a family or where a clash occurred with an existing gene name, a letter was added (e. g., human CES 4 A; <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> Ces 1 a) that reflected gene relatedness among rodent species (e. g., <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> Ces 1 a). Pseudogenes were named by adding "P" and a number to the human gene name (e. g., human CES 1 P 1) or by using a new letter followed by ps for <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> Ces pseudogenes (e. g., Ces 2 d-ps). Gene transcript isoforms were named by adding the GenBank accession ID to the gene symbol (e. g., human CES 1 _AB 119995 or mouse Ces 1 e_BC 019208). This nomenclature improves our understanding of human, <b>mouse,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> CES/Ces gene families and facilitates research into the structure, function, and evolution of these gene families.

5|$|Humans in {{good health}} excrete urine that is largely free of protein. Therefore, since 1827 {{physicians}} and scientists {{have been interested in}} proteinuria, the excess of protein in human urine, as an indicator of kidney disease. To better understand the etiology of proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in laboratory animals. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including Thomas Addis, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have protein in their urine. However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s that the major urinary proteins of <b>mice</b> <b>and</b> <b>rats</b> were first described in detail.

In 1986, the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment reported that estimates of the animals used in the U.S. range from 10 million to upwards of 100 million each year, and that their own best estimate was at least 17 million to 22 million.

Determination of equilibrium constants for dissociation (Ki) for their complexes with the target proteinase, cathepsin B, produced values not largely {{different from that}} for human cystatin C (Ki 0. 07 - 0. 13 nM). Rabbit antisera against <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> cystatin C {{were produced}} and used for improved affinity purification of the recombinant inhibitors. Affinity purified immunoglobulins isolated from the antiserum against mouse cystatin C were used for construction of a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

5|$|Guinea pigs {{were popular}} {{laboratory}} animals until the later 20th century; about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used {{annually in the}} U.S. for research in the 1960s, but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s. As of 2007, they constitute about 2% of the current total of laboratory animals. In the past, they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions, or anaphylaxis. Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation. Since the middle 20th century, they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by <b>mice</b> <b>and</b> <b>rats.</b> This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents, although geneticists W. E. Castle and Sewall Wright {{made a number of}} contributions to this area of study, especially regarding coat color. In 2004, the U.S.'s National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig.|$|E
5|$|In North America {{and most}} of Europe, voles predominate in the diet and shrews are {{the second most common}} food choice. <b>Mice</b> <b>and</b> <b>rats</b> form the main {{foodstuffs}} in the Mediterranean region, the tropics, sub-tropics and Australia. Barn owls are usually more specialist feeders in productive areas and generalists in drier areas. On the Cape Verde Islands, geckos are the mainstay of the diet, supplemented by birds such as plovers, godwits, turnstones, weavers and pratincoles, and on a rocky islet off the coast of California, a clutch of four young were being reared on a diet of Leach's storm petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa). In Ireland, the accidental introduction of the bank vole in the 1950s led to a major shift in the barn owl's diet: where their ranges overlap, the vole is now by far the largest prey item. Locally superabundant rodent species in the weight class of several grams per individual usually make up the single largest proportion of prey. In the United States, rodents and other small mammals usually make up ninety-five percent of the diet and worldwide, over ninety percent of the prey caught.|$|E
5|$|Some rodent {{species are}} serious {{agricultural}} pests, eating {{large quantities of}} food stored by humans. For example, in 2003, the amount of rice lost to <b>mice</b> <b>and</b> <b>rats</b> in Asia {{was estimated to be}} enough to feed 200 million people. Most of the damage worldwide is caused by {{a relatively small number of}} species, chiefly rats and mice. In Indonesia and Tanzania, rodents reduce crop yields by around fifteen percent, while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent. Across Africa, rodents including Mastomys and Arvicanthis damage cereals, groundnuts, vegetables and cacao. In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti, Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, vegetables and nuts. In Europe, as well as rats and mice, species of Apodemus, Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards, vegetables and pasture as well as cereals. In South America, a wider range of rodent species, such as Holochilus, Akodon, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Phyllotis, Sigmodon and Zygodontomys, damage many crops including sugar cane, fruits, vegetables, and tubers.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{have sought}} to find the precise {{function}} of Mups in pheromone communication. Mup proteins {{have been shown to}} promote puberty and accelerate the estrus cycle in female mice, inducing the Vandenbergh and Whitten effects. However, in both cases the Mups had to be presented to the female dissolved in male urine, indicating that the protein requires some urinary context to function. In 2007 Mups normally found in male mouse urine were made in transgenic bacteria, and therefore created devoid of the chemicals they normally bind. These Mups were shown to be sufficient to promote aggressive behaviour in males, {{even in the absence of}} urine. In addition, Mups made in bacteria were found to activate olfactory sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors, of <b>mice</b> <b>and</b> <b>rats.</b> Together, this demonstrated that Mup proteins can act as pheromones themselves, independent of their ligands.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} research into metallopharmaceuticals, including discussion of rhodium compounds in medicine. A substantial {{body of research}} has examined using metallocene derivatives of ruthenium and iron as metallopharmaceuticals. One area of such research has utilised metallocenes {{in place of the}} fluorophenyl group in haloperidol, which is a pharmaceutical classified as a typical antipsychotic. The ferrocenyl–haloperidol compound investigated has structure (C5H5)Fe(C5H4)–C(=O)–(CH2)3–N(CH2CH2)2C(OH)–C6H4Cl and can be converted to the ruthenium analog via a transmetalation reaction. Using the radioactive isotope 103Ru produces a ruthenocenyl–haloperidol radiopharmaceutical with a high affinity for lung but not brain tissue in <b>mice</b> <b>and</b> <b>rats.</b> Beta-decay of 103Ru produces the metastable isotope 103mRh in a rhodocenyl–haloperidol compound. This compound, like other rhodocene derivatives, has an unstable 19-valence electron configuration and rapidly oxidises to the expected cationic rhodocenium–haloperidol species. The separation of the ruthenocenyl–haloperidol and the rhodocenium–haloperidol species and the distributions of each amongst bodily organs has been studied. 103mRh has a half-life of 56min and emits a gamma ray of energy 39.8keV, so the gamma-decay of the rhodium isotope should follow soon after the beta-decay of the ruthenium isotope. Beta- and gamma-emitting radionuclides used medically include 131I, 59Fe, and 47Ca, and 103mRh has been proposed for use in radiotherapy for small tumours.|$|E
5|$|In many species, the molars are {{relatively}} large, intricately structured, and highly cusped or ridged. Rodent molars are well equipped to grind food into small particles. The jaw musculature is strong. The lower jaw is thrust forward while gnawing and is pulled backwards during chewing. Rodent groups {{differ in the}} arrangement of the jaw muscles and associated skull structures, both from other mammals and amongst themselves. The Sciuromorpha, such as the eastern grey squirrel, have a large deep masseter, making them efficient at biting with the incisors. The Myomorpha, such as the brown rat, have enlarged temporalis muscles, making them able to chew powerfully with their molars. The Hystricomorpha, such as the guinea pig, have larger superficial masseter muscles and smaller deep masseter muscles than rats or squirrels, possibly making them less efficient at biting with the incisors, but their enlarged internal pterygoid muscles may allow them to move the jaw further sideways when chewing. The cheek pouch is a specific morphological feature used for storing food and is evident in particular subgroups of rodents like kangaroo rats, hamsters, chipmunks and gophers which have two bags that may range from the mouth {{to the front of the}} shoulders. True <b>mice</b> <b>and</b> <b>rats</b> do not contain this structure but their cheeks are elastic due to a high degree of musculature and innervation in the region.|$|E
