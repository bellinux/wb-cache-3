5|$|First {{the hopeful}} note: There are faint signs the {{tinkering}} with Temperatures format {{could make the}} series funny later on, {{but only if the}} writing improves. The show now leaves most of the <b>mugging</b> to Lynde and no longer insists that each regular is wacky. It's all feeble stuff but the cast is vastly improved and the new approach portends to better things ahead.|$|E

5|$|A <b>mugging</b> {{at gunpoint}} in 1854 reputedly {{led to the}} {{establishment}} of a park police force. Until 2005 the park was policed by the separate Royal Parks Constabulary but that has now been subsumed into the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police. The mounted police have been replaced by a patrol team in a four-wheel drive vehicle. In 2015 the Friends of Richmond Park expressed concern about plans to cut the numbers of police in the park to half the level that they were ten years previously, despite an increase in visitor numbers and in incidents of crime.|$|E

40|$|Background We {{investigated}} whether consumers’ {{perception of}} a café latte beverage would {{be influenced by the}} colour (transparent, white or blue) of the <b>mug</b> from which it was drunk. Results In experiment 1, the white <b>mug</b> enhanced the rated “intensity” of the coffee flavour relative to the transparent <b>mug.</b> However, given slight physical differences in the <b>mugs</b> used, a second experiment was conducted using identical glass <b>mugs</b> with coloured sleeves. Once again, the colour of the <b>mug</b> was shown to influence participants’ rating of the coffee. In particular, the coffee was rated as less sweet in the white <b>mug</b> as compared to the transparent and blue <b>mugs.</b> Conclusions Both experiments demonstrate that the colour of the <b>mug</b> affects people’s ratings of a hot beverage. Given that ratings associated with the transparent glass <b>mug</b> were not significantly different from those associated with the blue <b>mug</b> in either experiment, an explanation in terms of simultaneous contrast can be ruled out. However, it is possible that colour contrast between the <b>mug</b> and the coffee may have affected the perceived intensity/sweetness of the coffee. That is, the white <b>mug</b> may have influenced the perceived brownness of the coffee and this, in turn, may have influenced the perceived intensity (and sweetness) of the coffee. These results support the view that the colour of the <b>mug</b> should be considered by those serving coffee as it can influence the consumer’s multisensory coffee drinking experience. These results add to a large and growing body of research highlighting the influence of product-extrinsic colour on the multisensory perception of food and drink...|$|R

25|$|Public sex of {{any kind}} is illegal {{in many parts of}} the world, and police {{undercover}} operations continue to be used in order to enforce such laws. Adverse personal consequences to participants in glory hole activity have included police surveillance, public humiliation in the press, often with marital and employment consequences, and imprisonment following a criminal conviction. Gay bashing, <b>mugging,</b> and bodily injury are further potential risks. For reasons of personal safety, as well as etiquette, men typically wait for a signal from the receptive partner to come through the hole before inserting any part of their genitals through a glory hole.|$|E
5000|$|<b>MUGs</b> {{exploded}} in {{size in the}} 1980s and were a primary method of distribution of freeware and shareware software.

Computer hardware and software companies found <b>MUGs</b> to be a valuable place {{to provide information about}} their products. They were often speakers at <b>MUG</b> meetings. While many of these companies still speak at <b>MUGs,</b> the Internet has replaced many of the tools of information and software access that were not as available to the public prior to the late 1990s. Many <b>MUGs</b> have had to reinvent themselves to focus on tools a <b>MUG</b> can better provide, mostly focusing on education and/or hands on experiences. Today's <b>MUGs</b> are generally smaller, but have had some revitalization with the increased popularity of Apple Inc. products in the mid-2000s.

50|$|A shaving scuttle and shaving <b>mug</b> were {{developed}} around the 19th century; the first patent for a shaving <b>mug</b> is dated 1867. As hot water was not common in many households, {{one way to}} provide hot lather was to use a scuttle or <b>mug.</b> A traditional scuttle resembles a teapot with a wide spout where hot water is poured in; {{this is where it}} differs from a shaving <b>mug,</b> which has no spout. Both shaving scuttles and <b>mugs</b> usually have a handle, but some have none. Shaving <b>mugs</b> often look like a standard <b>mug,</b> however, some also have a built in brush rest, so the brush does not sit in lather. Modern versions of the scuttle are in limited production, usually by independent potters working in small volumes.|$|R

Barbour has denied that there was any connection between the suspension of the Scott sisters' prison sentence and the controversy surrounding his Weekly Standard interview. Jamie Scott suffered from kidney failure while in prison, and requires a donated organ, which her sister Gladys had volunteered to provide. Barbour's decision to release the Scott sisters, however, is contingent upon the promised organ donation by Gladys Scott, which critics argued amounted to coercion and raises questions of medical ethics.|$|E

25|$|During the 1990s, {{most of the}} Soviet-era station {{names were}} changed, {{although}} financial difficulties after {{the breakup of the}} Soviet Union hit the Metro particularly hard in its infrastructure, operations and extensions. In the early-mid 1990s the Tbilisi metro was usually not working {{due to the lack of}} electricity. Until recently, the Metro had been underfunded and operated in severe difficulties due to poor electrical supply. It had also become infamous for widespread petty crime, like pickpocketing and <b>mugging.</b> In addition, there have been several incidents at metro stations in recent years.

50|$|Much of the <b>mug</b> design aims at thermal insulation: {{the thick}} {{walls of a}} <b>mug,</b> as {{compared}} to the thinner walls of teacups, insulate the beverage to prevent it from cooling or warming quickly. The <b>mug</b> bottom is often not flat, but either concave or has an extra rim, to reduce the thermal contact with the surface on which a <b>mug</b> is placed. These features often leave a characteristic circular stain on the surface. Finally, the handle of a <b>mug</b> keeps the hand away from the hot sides of a <b>mug.</b> The small cross section of the handle reduces heat flow between the liquid and the hand. For the same reason of thermal insulation, <b>mugs</b> are usually made of materials with low thermal conductivity, such as earthenware, bone china, porcelain, or glass.|$|R
