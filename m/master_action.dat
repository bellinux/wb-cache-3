40|$|A superfield {{algorithm}} for <b>master</b> <b>actions</b> of a {{class of}} gauge field theories including topological ones in arbitrary dimensions is presented generalizing a previous treatment in two dimensions. General forms for <b>master</b> <b>actions</b> in superspace are given, and possible theories are determined {{by means of a}} ghost number prescription and the master equations. The resulting <b>master</b> <b>actions</b> determine the original actions together with their gauge invariances. Generalized Poisson sigma models in arbitrary dimensions are constructed by means of this algorithm, and other applications in low dimensions are given including the Chern-Simon model. ...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, the BRST-quantization of gauge {{theories}} is discussed. A {{detailed analysis}} of the BRST-quantization on inner product spaces is performed for a class of abelian models, including reparametrization invariant ones. General rules how to obtain physical wave functions and propagators are proposed. The gauge fixing fermion is seen to play a central role for an admissible choice of the specific state space representation. Canonically equivalent solutions to the quantum master equation is found for a class of first order field theories, using a superfield formulation of the BV-framework. The analysis performed in d = 4 and d = 6 dimensions, shows that many <b>master</b> <b>actions</b> actually are canonically equivalent to simpler (minimal) <b>master</b> <b>actions.</b> The geometrical framework of almost product structures (APS) is adopted in order to investigate the splitting of manifolds induced by for example Yang-Mills theories and Kaluza-Klein theories. The properties of the Riemann-tensor are analyzed via the APS ansatz. New curvature relations are found in terms of the so called Vidal- and adapted connections...|$|R

The year 1990 saw the last American burst {{with the release of}} more Micromaster characters and the introduction of the <b>Action</b> <b>Masters,</b> non-transforming <b>action</b> figures who came with Transforming companions. Larger <b>Action</b> <b>Master</b> sets came with transforming vehicles and bases. The <b>Action</b> <b>Master</b> line was criticized for its perceived desperation for a gimmick, although it had a few defenders.

40|$|Abstract. Using a superfield {{formulation}} of extended phase space, we propose {{a new form}} of the Hamiltonian action functional. A remarkable feature of this construction is that it directly leads to the BV <b>master</b> <b>action</b> on phase space. Conversely, superspace can be used to construct nilpotent BRST charges directly from solutions to the classical Lagrangian Master Equation. We comment on the relation between these constructions and the specific <b>master</b> <b>action</b> proposal of Alexandrov, Kontsevich, Schwarz and Zaboronsky...|$|E
40|$|Developing the {{analysis}} in JHEP 03 (2014) 044 [arXiv: 1312. 1677] {{by the present}} authors et al., we clarify {{the relation between the}} Witten formulation and the Berkovits formulation of open superstring field theory {{at the level of the}} <b>master</b> <b>action,</b> namely the solution to the classical master equation in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, which is the key for the path-integral quantization. We first scrutinize the reducibility structure, a detailed gauge structure containing the information about ghost string fields. Then, extending the condition for partial gauge fixing introduced in the above-mentioned paper to the sector of ghost string fields, we investigate the <b>master</b> <b>action.</b> We show that the reducibility structure and the <b>master</b> <b>action</b> under partial gauge fixing of the Berkovits formulation can be regarded as the regularized versions of those in the Witten formulation.

Along with this, the run included recolours of some of the existing <b>Actions</b> <b>Masters</b> vehicle sets with new names to represent other characters.

40|$|We explore {{here the}} issue of duality versus {{spectrum}} equivalence in dual theories generated through the <b>master</b> <b>action</b> approach. Specifically we examine a generalized self-dual (GSD) model where a Maxwell term {{is added to the}} self-dual model. A gauge embedding procedure applied to the GSD model leads to a Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS) theory with higher derivatives. We show here that the latter contains a ghost mode contrary to the original GSD model. By figuring out the origin of the ghost we are able to suggest a new <b>master</b> <b>action</b> which interpolates between the local GSD model and a nonlocal MCS model. Those models share the same spectrum and are ghost free. Furthermore, there is a dual map between both theories at classical level which survives quantum correlation functions up to contact terms. The remarks made here may be relevant for other applications of the <b>master</b> <b>action</b> approach...|$|E

40|$|We present here a {{relationship}} among massive self-dual models for spin- 3 particles in $D= 2 + 1 $ via the <b>master</b> <b>action</b> procedure. Starting with a first order model (in derivatives) $S_{SD(1) }$ we have constructed a <b>master</b> <b>action</b> which interpolates among {{a sequence of}} four self-dual models $S_{SD(i) }$ where $i= 1, 2, 3, 4 $. By analyzing the particle content of mixing terms, we give additional arguments that explain why it is apparently impossible to jump from the fourth order model to a higher order model. We have also analyzed {{similarities and differences between}} the fourth order $K$-term in the spin- 2 case and the analogous fourth order term in the spin- 3 context. Comment: 16 page...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} there exists a hidden gauge reducibility in {{superstring}} field theory based on the small dynamical string field Ψ∈H_βγ whose gauge variation is also small δΨ∈H_βγ. It requires additional ghost-antighost fields in the gauge fixed or quantum gauge theory, and thus changes the Batalin-Vilkovisky <b>master</b> <b>action,</b> which implies that additional propagating degrees of freedom appear in the loop superstring amplitudes via the gauge choice of the field theory. We present that the resultant <b>master</b> <b>action</b> can take a different and enlarged form, and that there exist canonical transformations getting {{it back to the}} canonical form. On the basis of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, we obtain several exact results and clarify this underlying gauge structure of superstring field theory.
