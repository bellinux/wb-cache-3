5000|$|Following the September 1997 {{suicide bombing}} in Jerusalem, five American {{students}} who had been wounded were awarded $251 million in compensatory and punitive damages against the government of Iran and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps by Judge Ricardo M. Urbina, under the Flatow Amendment of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, in accordance with Section 201a of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, which states that [...] "in every {{case in which a}} person has obtained a judgment against a terrorist party on a claim based upon an act of terrorism ... the blocked assets of that terrorist party ... shall be subject to execution". Since most Iranian assets in the United States had been withdrawn after the embassy hostage crisis, the only substantial <b>monetary</b> <b>asset</b> left was approximately $150,000 in the Bank Melli's account in the Bank of New York. Before turning over the funds to the five students, however, the Bank of New York sued for a legal decision regarding its responsibilities in the case. The United States Department of Justice, speaking as amicus curiae in support of Bank Melli, advised that the bank had no responsibility for turning the funds over to the students; in March, 2006, Judge Denise Cole ruled against them, and was upheld by the Second Circuit Court in April, 2007. Bank Melli then withdrew the funds from Bank of New York.|$|E

In a {{world of}} perfect certainty, the user costs can be computed directly from assetreturn data, and so, the index is model-free. In the presence ofuncertainty, however, the true user cost of a <b>monetary</b> <b>asset</b> dependson the covariance of the asset s return with the marginal utility ofwealth. Intuitively, an asset s value depends both on its expectedpayoff and on the asset s ability to hedge wealth fluctuations. As aresult, the true user cost cannot be computed without an explicitmodel of preferences. It follows that the exact Divisia monetaryindex in a stochastic economy is not model-free, but depends on theunderlying preference assumptions. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the choice of a money stock measure on the inference about monetary shocks. To this end, it adopts order-invariant forecast error variance decompositions (FEVD) for an unrestricted vector autoregressive (UVAR) model. This approach does not require orthogonalization of shocks and is invariant to the ordering of the variables in the UVAR. The empirical work is based on estimating UVAR model using different methods of measurement of <b>monetary</b> <b>asset.</b> The results suggest that empirical conclusions from the FEVD analyses differ when money is measured by the flow of monetary services rather than by summation of the dollar amount of <b>monetary</b> <b>asset.</b> Further, the results show that qualitative inference about the money’s effects on the economic activity can depend crucially on the definition of money chosen.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relation between}} <b>monetary</b> <b>asset</b> components {{and some of the}} variables that traditionally enter into aggregate money demand relations. This is done for Danish data within the natural framework of a multivariate econometric model. The purpose of the study is to investigate issues in relation to the level and weighting of a monetary aggregate. We show that within this model it is possible to identify monetary aggregates at different levels of aggregation and that for the narrow aggregate (M 1) equal weighting of the components are permitted. For the broader aggregates, (M 2) or (M 2 -M 1), equal weighting is no longer appropriate. These findings are not contradictory to what we would expect from aggregation and index number theory. Finally, the overall identifica-tion of the stationary (or long-run) structure points towards a co-existence of a liquid and a less liquid money demand relation which is interpreted as an indication of the possibility of splitting the total money demand relation with respect to different motives for holding money. <b>Monetary</b> <b>asset</b> components; Aggregate money demand; Denmark; Demand relation...|$|E

Findings indicate that the life-cycle motive exerts a direct impact on household demand for interest-earning <b>monetary</b> <b>assets,</b> but not on non-interest-earning checking deposits. The strength of the relationship, however, varies among households with divergent characteristics. There is no evidence of a unitary income elasticity for both interest- and non-interest-yielding <b>monetary</b> <b>assets.</b> The demand for interest-earning <b>monetary</b> <b>assets</b> is very sensitive to changes in the own rate of interest, but the interest rate elasticity for non-interest-earning checking accounts is quite small.

40|$|Measuring the {{economic}} stock of money, defined {{to be the}} present value of current and future monetary service flows, is a difficult asset pricing problem, because most monetary assets yield interest. Thus, an interest yielding <b>monetary</b> <b>asset</b> is a joint product: a durable good providing a monetary service flow and a financial asset yielding a return. The currency equilivant index provides an elegant solution, but it does so by making strong assumptions about expectations of future monetary service flows. These assumptions cause the currency equivalent index to exhibit significant downward bias. In this paper, we propose an extension to the currency equivalent index that will correct for a significant amount of this bias. ...|$|E
