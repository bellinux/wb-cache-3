40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of {{antiviral drug resistance}} is an important problem {{in the treatment of}} human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection. Potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) is currently used for treatment, and typically consists of at least two reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors. To assess the impact of combination therapy on HIV- 1 mutagenesis, the mutagenic outcome of combined drug treatment was determined with several different RT drug combinations. Significant increases in HIV- 1 <b>mutant</b> <b>frequencies</b> were observed with combinations of nucleoside RT inhibitors as well as in combinations where nucleoside inhibitors were used along with hydroxyurea, a drug known to deplete nucleotide pools in cells. This indicates that combinations of RT drugs can act together to further increase HIV- 1 <b>mutant</b> <b>frequencies,</b> which could have important implications for virus population dynamics and could compromise drug therapy regimens...|$|R

40|$|Simple {{methods are}} {{presented}} to estimate rates of spontaneous mutation from <b>mutant</b> <b>frequencies</b> and population parameters in RNA viruses. Published <b>mutant</b> <b>frequencies</b> yield {{a wide range}} of mutation rates per genome per replication, mainly because mutational targets have usually been small and, thus, poor samples of the mutability of the average base. Nevertheless, there is a clear central tendency for lytic RNA viruses (bacteriophage Q beta, poliomyelitis, vesicular stomatitis, and influenza A) to display rates of spontaneous mutation of approximately 1 per genome per replication. This rate is some 300 -fold higher than previously reported for DNA-based microbes. Lytic RNA viruses thus mutate at a rate close to the maximum value compatible with viability. Retroviruses (spleen necrosis, murine leukemia, Rous sarcoma), however, mutate at an average rate about an order of magnitude lower than lytic RNA viruses...|$|R

To evaluate this issue for TMZ, we have measured the formation of DNA adducts and induction of lacI mutations in Big Blue Rat- 2 cells treated with TMZ. Treatment of Big Blue Rat- 2 cells with either 0, 0. 5, or 1 mM TMZ resulted in lacI <b>mutant</b> <b>frequencies</b> of 9. 1 2. 9 105, 48. 9 12 105, and 89. 7 40. 3 105, respectively.

Treatment of Big Blue Rat- 2 cells with various concentrations of TMZ produced a linear increase in the levels of N 7 -methylguanine and O 6 -methylguanine.

In infinite populations, the invasion fitness of a mutant in this two-allele representation of the evolutionary process is used to characterize features about long-term phenotypic evolution, such as singular points, convergence stability (established from first-order effects of selection), branching points, and evolutionary stability (established from second-order effects of selection).

Apoptosis and mutant frequencies were determined in spermatogenic cells obtained from Bax-null or Trp 53 -null mice. The results showed that spermatogenic lineage apoptosis was markedly decreased in Bax-null mice and was accompanied by a significantly increased spontaneous <b>mutant</b> <b>frequency</b> in seminiferous tubule cells compared to that of wild-type mice. Apoptosis profiles in the seminiferous tubules for Trp 53 -null were similar to control mice. Spontaneous mutant frequencies in pachytene spermatocytes and in round spermatids from Trp 53 -null mice were not significantly different from those of wild-type mice. However, epididymal spermatozoa from Trp 53 -null mice displayed a greater spontaneous <b>mutant</b> <b>frequency</b> compared to that from wild-type mice.

D 17 cells were treated with thymidine, hydroxyurea (HU), or AZT, and the effects on in vivo dNTP pools were measured. Thymidine and HU treatments induced significant dNTP pool imbalances. In contrast, AZT treatment had very little effect on the dNTP pools.

40|$|Background. In {{a number}} of recent {{experiments}} with food-and-mouth disease virus, a deleterious mutant, was found to avoid extinction and remain in the population for long periods of time. This observation was called quasispecies memory. The origin of quasispecies memory is not fully understood. Results. We propose and analyze a simple model of complementation between the wild type virus and a mutant that has an impaired ability of cell entry. The mutant will go extinct unless it is recreated from the wild type through mutations. However, under phenotypic mixing-and-hiding as a mechanism of complementation, the time to extinction in the absence of mutations increases with increasing multiplicity of infection (m. o. i.). The <b>mutant's</b> <b>frequency</b> at equilibrium under selection-mutation balance also increases with increasing m. o. i. At high m. o. i., a large fraction of mutant genomes are encapsidated with wild-type protein, which enables them to infect cells as efficiently as the wild type virions, and thus increases their fitness to the wild-type level. Moreover, even at low m. o. i. the equilibrium <b>frequency</b> of the <b>mutant</b> is higher than predicted by the standard quasispecies model, because a fraction of mutant virions generated from wild-type parents will also be encapsidated by wild-type protein. Conclusions. Our model predicts that phenotypic hiding will strongly influence the population dynamics of viruses, particularly at high m. o. i., and will also have important effects on the mutation [...] selection balance at low m. o. i. The delay in mutant extinction and increase in <b>mutant</b> <b>frequencies</b> at equilibrium may, at least in part, explain memory in quasispecies populations.

However, spermatogenic cells from old lacI mice display a 10 -fold higher <b>mutant</b> <b>frequency.</b> This increased spontaneous <b>mutant</b> <b>frequency</b> occurs coincidentally with decreased in vitro base excision repair activity for germ cell and testicular extracts that in turn corresponds to a decreased abundance of AP endonuclease.

A unique combination of environmental exposure and deficiency in these responses can lead to genomic instability; this “gene–environment interaction” paradigm is a theme for research on chronic disease etiology. In the present study, we used mouse embryonic fibroblasts with a gene deletion in the base excision repair (BER) enzymes DNA β-polymerase (β-pol) and alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG), along with exposure to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) to study mutagenesis {{as a function of}} a particular gene–environment interaction.

We found that DNA synthesis activities of thymic lymphomas, detected as incorporation of [3 H]TTP into acid-insoluble materials, were 2 - to 10 -fold higher compared to those of normal thymus. Furthermore, <b>mutant</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the forward mutation assay of DNA synthesis were increased 2 - to 7 -fold in cell extracts from thymic lympho mas compared to those from normal thymus. As the DNA polymerase /! (pol ÃŸ) activity was extremely high in the thymic lymphomas, we screened mutations in the pol ÃŸgene to examine the possibility of involvement of mutated pol ÃŸin reduction of the fidelity of DNA synthesis.

40|$|Gametes {{carry the}} DNA that will direct the {{development}} of the next generation. By compromising genetic integrity, DNA damage and mutagenesis threaten the ability of gametes to fulfill their biological function. DNA repair pathways function in germ cells and serve to ameliorate much DNA damage and prevent mutagenesis. High base excision repair (BER) activity is documented for spermatogenic cells. DNA polymerase-beta (POLB) is required for the short-patch BER pathway. Because mice homozygous null for the Polb gene die soon after birth, mice heterozygous for Polb were used to examine the extent to which POLB contributes to maintaining spermatogenic genomic integrity in vivo. POLB protein levels were reduced only in mixed spermatogenic cells. In vitro short-patch BER activity assays revealed that spermatogenic cell nuclear extracts obtained from Polb heterozygous mice had one third the BER activity of age-matched control mice. Polb heterozygosity had no effect on the BER activities of somatic tissues tested. The Polb heterozygous mouse line was crossed with the lacI transgenic Big Blue mouse line to assess <b>mutant</b> <b>frequency.</b> The spontaneous <b>mutant</b> <b>frequency</b> for mixed spermatogenic cells prepared from Polb heterozygous mice was 2 -fold greater than that of wild-type controls, but no significant effect was found among the somatic tissues tested. These results demonstrate that normal POLB abundance is necessary for normal BER activity, which is critical in maintaining a low germline <b>mutant</b> <b>frequency.</b> Notably, spermatogenic cells respond differently than somatic cells to Polb haploinsufficiency. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{analysed}} {{the possibility}} that a reduced gravitational force impairs the efficiency of DNA repair, increasing the risk of the exposure to conditions occurring during spaceflight: i. e., ionising radiation and microgravity. To obtain information on the effects of the reduced gravity in repairing DNA damage induced by radiation, we compared cell survival and <b>mutant</b> <b>frequency</b> at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) locus in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) irradiated and subsequently incubated for 24 h in 1 g or modeled microgravity. A weak decrease of the surviving fraction and a significant increase of the HPRT <b>mutant</b> <b>frequency</b> were observed in PBL incubated in modeled microgravity after irradiation compared with those maintained in 1 g. Given the increase of HPRT mutants observed in MMG, we investigated whether modeled microgravity can alter the transcription of 14 genes representative of the main DNA repair pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR), base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER). The transcriptional profiles of almost all BER and NER genes were up-regulated in irradiated PBL, whereas the expression of HR and NHEJ genes was only slightly or not affected by radiation. Incubation in modeled microgravity after irradiation did not significantly change the expression of genes involved in DNA repair, suggesting that transcriptional impairment was not responsible for the increase of <b>mutant</b> <b>frequency</b> observed in irradiated cells incubated in microgravity in comparison to the static 1 g condition...|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of DNA damage {{is a slow}} but hazardous phenomenon {{that may lead to}} cell death, accelerated aging, and cancer. One of the most versatile defense mechanisms against the {{accumulation of}} DNA damage is nucleotide excision repair, in which, among others, the Xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) and group A (XPA) proteins are involved. To elucidate differences in the functions of these two proteins, comprehensive survival studies with Xpa-/-, Xpc-/-and wild-type control female mice in a pure C 57 BL/ 6 J background were done. The median survival of Xpc-/-mice showed a significant decrease, whereas the median survival of Xpa-/-mice did not. Strikingly, Xpa-/-and Xpc-/-mice also showed a phenotypical difference in terms of tumor spectrum. Xpc-/-mice displayed a significant increase in lung tumors and a trend toward increased liver tumors compared with Xpa-deficient or wild-type mice. Xpa-/-mice showed a significant elevation in liver tumors. Additionally, Xpc-deficient mice exhibited a strong increase in <b>mutant</b> <b>frequency</b> in lung compared with Xpa-/-mice, whereas in both models <b>mutant</b> <b>frequency</b> is increased in liver. Our in vitro data displayed an elevated sensitivity to oxygen in Xpc-/-in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) when compared with Xpa-/-and wild-type fibroblasts. We believe that XPC plays a role in the removal of oxidative DNA damage and that, therefore, Xpc-/-mice display a significant increase in lung tumors and a significant elevation in <b>mutant</b> <b>frequency</b> in lung, and Xpc-deficient MEFs show greater sensitivity to oxygen when compared with Xpa-/-and wild-type mice...|$|E

40|$|A mutator gene, mutD 5, whose {{phenotype}} is conditional, {{has been}} identified in Escherichia coli. By P 1 transduction {{it has been shown}} to lie at about 5. 7 min on the chromosome, being co-transduced with proA and argF. In rich medium, streptomycin- and nalidixic acid-resistant mutation frequencies are 50 to 100 times higher than those in minimal medium. In minimal medium, the mutD 5 -induced mutation frequencies are still 50 to 100 times above co-isogenic wild-type (mut+) levels. Similar results were obtained with all markers tested. <b>Mutant</b> <b>frequencies</b> can be raised by thymidine in the medium at concentrations as low as 0. 04 μM, or by the endogenous generation of thymidine from thymine plus a deoxyribosyl donor. Deoxyadenosine, various ribonucleosides, thymine, and 2 -deoxyribose do not stimulate mutation. None of these effects are related to growth rate, since growth rate and mutation rate can be decoupled completely...|$|R
40|$|An {{infectious}} cDNA clone of Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV) (genus Poacevirus; family Potyviridae) {{was used}} to establish three independent lineages in wheat to examine intra-host population diversity levels within protein 1 (P 1) and coat protein (CP) cistrons over time. Genetic variation was assessed at passages 9, 18 and 24 by single-strand conformation polymorphism, followed by nucleotide sequencing. The founding P 1 region genotype was retained at high frequencies in most lineage/passage populations, while the founding CP genotype disappeared after passage 18 in two lineages. We found that rare TriMV genotypes were present only transiently and lineages followed independent evolutionary trajectories, suggesting that genetic drift dominates TriMV evolution. These results further suggest that experimental populations of TriMV exhibit lower <b>mutant</b> <b>frequencies</b> than that of Wheat streak mosaic virus (genus Tritimovirus; family Potyviridae) in wheat. Nevertheless, there was evidence for parallel evolution at a synonymous site in the TriMV CP cistron...|$|R
