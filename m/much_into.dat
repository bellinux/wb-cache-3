5|$|When O'Brien {{finally decided}} to write a {{biography}} on Madonna in 2005, she wanted the book to be more about the singer's contribution to her music, rather than delving too <b>much</b> <b>into</b> her personal life, unlike other Madonna biographers. The author then interviewed dancers, choreographers, musicians, and producers who worked with Madonna. After its release, the book received a mixed response from critics. They were unanimous that the over-emphasis given on the singer's discography was unnecessary, instead more thought should have been given on exploring her personal life, which {{would have made the}} biography compelling.|$|E
5|$|When {{dramatic}} plot developments made Sasuke {{one of the}} series' antagonists, Kishimoto compared him and Naruto to the yin {{and yang}} due to their notable differences and complementary natures. He has mentioned that when one progresses, he makes sure the other does as well. In 2013, as the series approached its climax, Kishimoto encouraged readers {{to look forward to}} Sasuke and Naruto's final fight. Since it started serialization, Kishimoto had planned that the series' ending would feature the final fight between the two characters, although he was not sure whether the characters would end the duel as friends or enemies. While the two use ninja techniques in the beginning, in the climax the author wanted both fighters to rely on hand-to-hand combat. In the end, Kishimoto decided to have Naruto forgive Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato, another former enemy. Anime staff Chengxi Huang said the animated adaptation of this fight, the group worked carefully to depict the action in every scene by showing changes on Sasuke and Naruto's clothes and hair. Huang added he felt fatigue by working so <b>much</b> <b>into</b> this fight due to reaching 70 successive cuts at a time.|$|E

5|$|When first {{introducing}} Sasuke, Kishimoto {{wrote him}} as a rival who never noticed Naruto. However, as the series continued, Naruto became strong enough to be recognized by Sasuke as a rival. He also intended both as brothers {{due to the fact}} both characters suffered loneliness, something which made the readers relate to them as he noted through fan latters. By Part I's ending, the bond between Naruto and Sasuke was weakened {{as a result of their}} fight but still expected the time when the Sasuke accepted Naruto as an equal. Kishimoto drastically changed Sasuke's character, and the plot, by making him one of the series' antagonists, comparing Sasuke and Naruto to the concept of yin and yang because of their notable differences. When one of the two progressed, Kishimoto made sure the other did too. Before the serialization began, Kishimoto had decided the ending would feature a fight between these two characters. He wanted the conflict to end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato. By 2013 when the series was reaching its climax, Kishimoto told the readers to look forward the final fight between the two characters.

Additionally, he felt a war with Britain would push Japan too <b>much</b> <b>into</b> the embrace of Germany to the latter's advantage.

Ultimately, they felt that [...] "the plot seems somewhat shoe-horned into the familiar universe" [...] and [...] "one feels that Hergé's heart was not really <b>much</b> <b>into</b> the action part of the story", ultimately awarding it three stars out of five.|$|E
500|$|York manager McEwan {{compared}} Donaldson to Paulo Wanchope in September 2006, but following York's 2–0 away defeat against Oxford United {{later that}} month, McEwan criticised Donaldson's selfishness in attack, saying it cost them the match.

Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Mick McCarthy watched him in York's 1–0 home victory over Altrincham, in which he scored his 12th goal of the season, on 5 November 2006. He was also watched by Scottish Premier League club Hibernian. In response to this speculation, Donaldson said: [...] "I don't read too <b>much</b> <b>into</b> the speculation. I've heard it before and nothing has happened so I will just keep my head down and enjoy my football until a point comes when the manager or board come and tell me they have had an offer they want to consider".|$|E
500|$|Madonna's {{version of}} the song begins {{with the sound of}} {{acoustic}} guitars and synth strings. Madonna's voice sounds high-pitched, eluding the deeper resonance of the tune. After the first verse, Tony Thompson starts playing the drums, which moves along the rhythm of the song. Towards the end, Madonna sings the song like a soul singer and the song ends with a gasp of breath. The song was recorded at Power Station Studio in Manhattan, New York. Rodgers recalled: [...] "Madonna had never performed with a live orchestra before. I was very <b>much</b> <b>into</b> doing everything live, so I just said, 'Madonna, you go out there and sing and we will follow you.' At first Madonna was hesitant, but the live setting ended up producing memorable results. She sang and she was overcome with emotions and she started crying, but I left it on the record." ...|$|E

500|$|Andrew Graham-Dixon asserts all Dutch Golden Age landscapists {{could not}} help but search {{everywhere}} for meaning. He says of the windmill in The Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede that it symbolises [...] "the sheer hard work needed to keep Holland above water and to safeguard the future of the nation's children". The symmetries in the landscapes are [...] "reminders to fellow citizens always to remain on the straight and narrow". Slive is more reluctant to read too <b>much</b> <b>into</b> the work, but does put The Windmill in its contemporary religious context of man's dependence on the [...] "spirit of the Lord for life". With regards to interpreting Ruisdael's Scandinavian paintings, he says [...] "My own view is that it strains credulity to the breaking point to propose that he himself conceived of all his depictions of waterfalls, torrents and rushing streams and dead trees as visual sermons on the themes of transcience and vanitas".|$|E

They are mostly free-associative and have no particular meaning. Exceptions include [...] "The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch", about the historical A.W. Underwood of Paw Paw, Michigan with the purported ability to set items ablaze with his breath; according to Eno, the song [...] "celebrates {{the possibility of a}} love affair with the man." [...] Eno has attempted to dissuade fans from reading too <b>much</b> <b>into</b> his words; he claims that the song [...] "Needles in the Camel's Eye" [...] was [...] "written in less time than it takes to sing...
