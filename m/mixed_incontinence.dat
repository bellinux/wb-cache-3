30|$|Traditionally, {{results of}} anti-incontinence surgery were {{considered}} poor {{in women with}} <b>mixed</b> <b>incontinence</b> due to possible aggravation of their overactive bladder symptoms [23, 24]. This was recently challenged by Duckett et al.

In our study, the subjective success rates were significantly lower in women with <b>mixed</b> <b>incontinence</b> (51 %) compared with 86 % in women with USI.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the value of urodynamic investigation in the preoperative workup of midurethral sling surgery and to identify risk factors for failure after 3 different midurethral sling procedures. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. 437 women who underwent a tension-free vaginal tape, Monarc, or tension-free vaginal tape-obturator procedure without other simultaneously performed urogynecological surgery were included. Preoperative data were collected from the medical files. Patients who reported any amount of leakage were considered failures. The mean follow-up of the study population was 14 months. RESULTS: After multivariate analysis, <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> (P =. 04), previous incontinence surgery (P =. 022), and detrusor overactivity (P =. 02) were significantly related to failure of midurethral sling procedures. There were no predictive urodynamic parameters for failure in patients with <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> or previous incontinence surgery.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the short term}} results, reliability and complications of Trans Obturator Tape (TOT) operations in patients with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Material and Methods: Of 71 patients with SUI or <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence,</b> we included 66 patients who had undergone TOT operations due to SUI or <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> (MUI) in our prospective study. Gynecological and neurological examinations, ultrasonographic evaluations, Q-Tip tests, office cystometry tests, complete urine analysis, and urine culture tests were performed. Patients were evaluated again following an average of 9 months (5 - 14 months) after the operation. Results: After an average of 9 months after the operation, 86 % of the patients were cured. Although we experienced no major intraoperative complications, 24. 2 % of patients had reported limb pain, 6. 1 % had vaginal erosion, 3 % developed de novo urgency, 7. 6 % had obstruction and 4. 5 % suffered from dyspareunia.

Cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision tree and a 5 -year time horizon based on the outcomes of cost per woman successfully treated and cost per Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, and a value of information analysis are also undertaken. Bladder ultrasonography is more costly and less effective test-treat strategy than clinical history and urodynamics. Treatment on the basis of clinical history alone has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £ 491, 100 per woman successfully treated and an ICER of £ 60, 200 per QALY compared with the treatment of all women on the basis of urodynamics. Restricting the use of urodynamics to women with a clinical history of <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> only is the optimal test-treat strategy on cost-effectiveness grounds with ICERs of £ 19, 500 per woman successfully treated and £ 12, 700 per QALY compared with the treatment of all women based upon urodynamics. Conclusions remained robust to sensitivity analyses, but subject to large uncertainties. Treatment based upon urodynamics {{can be seen as a}} cost-effective strategy, and particularly when targeted at women with clinical history of <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> only.

OBJECTIVES: To {{determine the effects of}} pelvic floor muscle training for women with diagnoses of stress, urge and <b>mixed</b> <b>incontinence.</b> MATERIALS AND METHOD: 35 women with urodynamic diagnoses of stress, urge or <b>mixed</b> <b>incontinence</b> included pelvic floor muscle training. Each subject received a total of 10 treatment sessions during 5 consecutive weeks, consisting 15 -minute sessions pelvic-floor muscle exercise and biofeedback program followed by a 25 minute of electrical stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Pelvic-floor rehabilitation appeared to be an effective treatment for women with stress or <b>mixed</b> <b>incontinence.</b> As a general rule, the least invasive and least dangerous procedure for the patient should be the first choice, and behavioural and rehabilitative techniques should be considered as the first line of therapy for urinary incontinence.

40|$|Almost every forth {{woman is}} {{suffering}} from urinary incontinence. Most frequent types of urinary incontinence are stress urinary incontinence (SUI), over active bladder (OAB) and <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> (MUI). Beside medical history and sonography, urodynamic testing is commonly used to differentiate between these forms of urinary incontinence. During urodynamic testing the bladder capacity is measured routinely. A small bladder capacity has already been described in patients with over active bladder. Neither in stress urinary <b>incontinence</b> nor in <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> the meaning of bladder capacity has been analyzed. In this trial the evaluation of a possible relationship between bladder capacity {{and the type of}} urinary incontinence was the point of interest. Therefore three groups of women with urinary incontinence were formed, in detail stress urinary incontinence, over active bladder and <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence.</b> Additionally a continent control group was examined in order to verify the results. As already known from current literature smallest bladder capacity was found in patients with over active bladder. Patients suffering from stress urinary incontinence showed a significantly higher bladder capacity than patients with over active bladder. This mismatch in bladder capacity could be explained with small bladders in the OAB group but could also be a hint for large bladder capacities in patients with SUI. Though these patients presented the largest bladder capacity, a significant difference to the control group was not obvious. Probably a certain bias was created by the control group being continent but showing possible risk factors for SUI in their patient history. Another significant difference was apparent between stress and <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence.</b> A possible explanation would be that the component of overactivity had a stronger influence than stress component. As urodynamic testing is an expensive and invasive technique, there is desire to establish less invasive diagnostics like perineal sonography. Different sonographic markers for hypermobility of the urethra were measured in this trial and a comparison between the four groups was carried out including correlation analysis of bladder capacity and the sonographic findings. Finally no correlation was obvious. In consequence urodynamic testing so far remains the gold standard for diagnostic in urinary incontinence as it reveals not only morphologic aberrations but also functional changes...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of stress urinary incontinence, urge <b>incontinence</b> and <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> among women residing {{in the city of}} Jundiaí (São Paulo, Brazil), and the relation between the type of incontinence and the obstetric history of these women. Methods: A cross-sectional community-based study was conducted. A total of 332 women were interviewed; they were seen for whatever reason at the public primary healthcare units of the city of Jundiaí, from March 2005 to April 2006. A pre-tested questionnaire was administered and consisted of questions used in the EPINCONT Study (Epidemiology of Incontinence in the County of Nord-Trondelag). Statistical analysis was carried out using the χ 2 test and odds ratio (95 %CI). Results: Urinary incontinence was a complaint for 23. 5 % of the women interviewed. Stress urinary incontinence prevailed (50 %), followed by <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> (35 %) and urge incontinence (15 %). Being in the age group of 35 - 64 years, having a body mass index of 30 or greater and having had only vaginal delivery or cesarean section, with uterine contraction, regardless of the number of pregnancies, were factors associated with stress urinary incontinence. However, being in the age group of 55 or older, having a body mass index of 30 or greater and having had three or more pregnancies, only with vaginal deliveries, were factors associated with <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence.</b> Conclusions: One third of the interviewees complained of some type of urinary incontinence, and half of them presented stress urinary incontinence.

30|$|We {{have found}} no other study which {{analyses}} <b>mixed</b> <b>incontinence</b> separately in two groups as we have done. The subdivision appears to be of practical interest. The relatively large differences in cure between the two mixed incontinent groups suggest that women in the different groups should be given additional information before a choice for treatment of incontinence. Offering surgical treatment to mixed incontinent women predominantly bothered by stress incontinence is today not controversial. To offer a TVT operation to women significantly bothered by urge incontinence or those with low-pressure urethras is, in our opinion, appropriate provided the women are informed about what they risk {{and what they can}} achieve. Though Griffith et al. and Kulseng-Hanssen et al. stated that cystometry has low diagnostic sensitivity in evaluating <b>mixed</b> <b>incontinence</b> patients, we used the cystometric criterion to specifically choose the patients that are not normally considered surgical candidates for sling surgery and have shown a definite benefit [7, 28].|$|E

40|$|Despite its common {{occurrence}} and often seemingly obvious causes, female urinary incontinence requires a thorough and thoughtful evaluation for its proper diagnosis and treatment. With rare exceptions, urinary incontinence {{is the result}} of failure of the sphincter mechanism to resist bladder pressures encountered during daily activities. This {{may be the result of}} sphincter failure, overactivity of the bladder detrusor muscle or both. In uncomplicated cases, the diagnosis is usually based on an evaluation in the office. Urodynamic and cystoscopic study may be helpful in complex, resistant and recurring cases of urinary incontinence of any cause. Most cases of incontinence may be classified as stress, urge or <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence.</b> Treatment of stress urinary incontinence focuses on supplementing the urethral continence mechanisms, particularly the urethral supports and periurethral striated muscle function. The current paradigm for the treatment of urge incontinence centres on pharmacologic therapy, primarily by correcting detrusor overactivity with antimuscarinic drugs. Other therapies aimed at altering sensorimotor function may be used in resistant cases.

40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the incidence of long-term bladder dysfunction after type 3 - 4 radical hysterectomy in patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). METHODS. A case-control study was conducted to evaluate the occurrence of long-term bladder dysfunction in 76 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Stage IB-IIA (> 4 cm), Stage IIB, and Stage III cervical carcinoma who underwent type 3 - 4 radical hysterectomy after NACT. Preoperative assessment included acquisition of a standardized urogynecologic history, evaluation of severity of urinary incontinence symptoms, maintenance of a 3 -day voiding diary, pelvic examination, urogynecologic physical examination, urodynamic assessment, and estimation of hydronephrosis. Follow-up was carried out at least 12 months after surgery. RESULTS. Urinary symptoms (sensory loss, difficult micturition, severe urinary incontinence) were reported by 20 patients (26 %). Eighteen patients (24 %) had a normal urodynamic profile, 16 patients (21 %) had detrusor overactivity, 22 patients (29 %) had urodynamic stress incontinence, 2 patients (2 %) had aconctractile detrusor, and 18 patients (24 %) had <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence.</b> The length of vagina removed was significantly greater among patients who had detrusor overactivity and <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> compared with patients who had a normal diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS. The observed rate of bladder dysfunction was higher than the corresponding rate reported in the literature (76 %). Three main disturbances were found: detrusor overactivity (21 %), <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> (24 %), and de novo stress incontinence (21 %). Detrusor overactivity was related to a prevalence of hypertonic bladder. Among patients who underwent type 4 radical hysterectomy, the extent of caudal resection of rectovaginal ligaments and vaginal tissue was found to be more strongly associated with bladder dysfunction than was the extent of lateral parametrial resection. Despite the fact that 76 % of patients had abnormal urodynamic parameters, most patients were satisfied with their voiding condition. © 2004 American Cancer Society...|$|R
30|$|<b>Mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> {{is defined}} as the {{complaint}} of involuntary leakage associated with urgency and also with exertion, effort, sneezing, or coughing [1]. Involuntary leakage associated with urgency was initially thought to cause failure in surgery for stress incontinence [2], and surgery was therefore only considered appropriate when a cystometrogram showed no detrusor overactivity [3]. The measurement of intrinsic sphincter deficiency is best understood as the urodynamic criteria of mean urethral closure pressure (MUCP) of < 20  cm H 2 O or valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP) of < 60  cm H 2 O [4].|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} the reclassification rate of clinically diagnosed stress, mixed, and urge urinary incontinence after urodynamic investigation. Methods: A systematic {{review of the}} published literature in MEDLINE and EMBASE of clinical trials among women with urinary incontinence. Studies were included in case the diagnosis based on symptoms and/or signs was compared with the diagnosis after urodynamic investigation. Results: Twenty-three articles involving 6, 282 women with urinary incontinence met the inclusion criteria. A clinical diagnosis of stress urinary incontinence was reclassified into <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> in 9 % of women and into detrusor overactivity (DO) in 7 % of cases. The pooled reclassification rate was highest among patients with symptoms of <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence,</b> where 46 % of the patients had stress urinary incontinence and 21 % had DO on urodynamic investigation. The available literature does not allow {{the identification of the}} additional value of non-invasive test, such as stress test and voiding diary, accessory to symptoms. None of the studies had therapeutic effects as an outcome measure. Conclusions: This review of clinical studies shows that the level of agreement between classification based on clinical evaluation and based on urodynamic investigation is poor. Urodynamic observations are regarded as gold standard, but based on the poor correlation, this assumption should be questioned. Neurourol. Urodynam. 30 : 495 - 502, 2011.

40|$|Abstract Background Urinary {{incontinence}} negatively {{influences the}} lives of 25 - 50 % of elderly women, mostly due to feelings of shame and being limited in activities and social interactions. This study explores whether differences exist between types of urinary incontinence (stress, urgency or mixed) and severity of the symptoms, {{with regard to their}} effects on generic and condition-specific quality of life. Methods This is a cross-sectional study among participants of a randomized controlled trial in primary care. A total of 225 women (aged ≥ 55 years) completed a questionnaire (on physical/emotional impact and limitations) and were interviewed for demographic characteristics and co-morbidity. Least squares regression analyses were conducted to estimate differences between types and severity of urinary incontinence with regard to their effect on quality of life. Results Most patients reported <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> (50. 7 %) and a moderate severity of symptoms (48. 9 %). Stress urinary incontinence had a lower impact on the emotional domain of condition-specific quality of life compared with <b>mixed</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> (r = − 7. 81). There were no significant associations between the types of urinary incontinence and generic quality of life. Severe symptoms affected both the generic (r = − 0. 10) and condition-specific (r = 17. 17) quality of life. Conclusions The effects on condition-specific quality of life domains differ slightly between the types of incontinence. The level of severity affects both generic and condition-specific quality of life, indicating {{that it is not the}} type but rather the severity of urinary incontinence that is the main predictor of decreased quality of life. </p...|$|R
