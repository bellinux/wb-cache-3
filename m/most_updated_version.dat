40|$|Aiming {{to study}} the {{freshness}} of Persian information, the study attempted to explore the indexing speed of Persian newspapers in Google, Yahoo and Bing. The present study was conducted using a webometric method. The population study comprised all the online newspapers published in Persian. The study sample was identified using a targeted method. It included those Persian newspapers listed on the Magiran database with their electronic versions regularly published on their respective websites. The results revealed that Google outperforms the two other search engines in terms of timely indexing the Persian newspapers. Furthermore, it generally enjoys a more consistent and stable indexing model. Yahoo and Bing are not only slower in indexing the newspapers, but also experience a comparably lower consistency level in their indexing models. Yahoo and Bing show to be comparable in their indexing speeds. In this study, the indexing status of Persian newspapers on different internet search engines was investigated for the first time. Results showed that those accessing these newspapers using internet search engines will have a higher chance of accessing their <b>most</b> <b>updated</b> <b>versions</b> using Google...|$|R
40|$|Micron-level {{stability}} of the Compact LInear Collider(CLIC) two-beam modules, two-meter repetitive units constituting the main linacs, {{is one of the}} most important requirements to achieve the final luminosity target. High power dissipation during normal operation modes of modules will result in misalignments in and between different elements of the linacs, thus affecting the final resulting luminosity. In this paper, updated finite element models of CLIC two-beam modules are presented and the structural behaviour of them is studied in more detail than in the earlier simulations. In particular, the models have been refined by improving the modelling of actuators and bellows as well as studying the <b>most</b> <b>updated</b> <b>versions</b> of CLIC modules. Based on the main operation modes of the CLIC collider, the results of thermal and structural analysis of two-beam modules are presented. These numerical results will be validated by experimental tests to be performed in 2012 with full-scale CLIC prototype modules. They will allow for better understanding the thermo-mechanical behaviour and they will be propagated back to numerical modellin...|$|R

40|$|Introductory {{texts on}} {{psychological}} testing and evaluation historically {{are not in}} short supply. Typically, however, such texts have been relatively superficial in their discussion of clinical material and have focused primarily on the theoretical and psychometric properties of indi­ vidual tests. More practical, clinically relevant presentations of psychological instruments have been confined to individual volumes with advanced and often very technical information geared to the more sophisticated user. Professors in introductory graduate courses are often forced to adopt several advanced texts to cover the material, {{at the same time}} helping students wade through unnecessary technical information in order to provide a basic working knowl­ edge of each test. Understanding Psychological Assessment is an attempt to address these concerns. It brings together into a single volume a broad sampling of the most respected instruments in the psychologist 2 ̆ 7 s armamentarium along with promising new tests of cognitive, vocational, and personality functioning. Additionally, it presents the <b>most</b> <b>updated</b> <b>versions</b> of these tests, all in a practical, clearly written format that covers the development, psychometrics, administra­ tive considerations, and interpretive hypotheses for each instrument. Clinical case studies allow the reader to apply the interpretive guidelines to real clinical data, thereby reinforcing basic understanding of the instrument and helping to insure that both the student and practi­ tioner can actually begin to use the test. Understanding Psychological Assessment includes cognitive and personality tests for adults, children, and adolescents, as well as chapters on the theory of psychological measurement and integrated report writing.

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} <b>most</b> recently <b>updated</b> <b>version</b> {{of a computer}} program which simulates the motion of a geostationary satellite influenced by perturbations and controlled by maneuvers according to certain station keeping strategies. The program allows the consideration of constraints imposed by the satellite configuration and errors of orbit determination and thrust execution. In the present form, 4 station keeping strategies are implemented. They can be replaced by alternative strategies by slight program modifications. Using simplified models for the orbit and the maneuvers, the running times are short so as to allow repeated simulations of several years of station keeping {{within a few minutes}} of computer time. The program is designed to optimize certain station keeping strategy parameters by iterative application of the simulation. Hence it can be a useful tool for test, design and optimization of station keeping strategies...|$|R

It is found that shear interaction above and within the drainage flow are important, and are overpredicted with the new scheme at small grid spacing (< {approximately} 1000 m).

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{continuation}} of [13], where new variational principles were introduced based on the concept of anti-selfdual (ASD) Lagrangians. We continue here the program of using these Lagrangians to provide variational formulations and resolutions to various basic equations and evolutions which do not normally fit in the Euler-Lagrange framework. In particular, we consider stationary equations of the form -Au∈∂ϕ (u) as well as i dissipative evolutions of the form -u̇(t) -A_t u(t) +ω u(t) ∈∂ϕ (t, u(t)) were ϕ is a convex potential on an infinite dimensional space. In this paper, the emphasis is on the cases where the differential operators involved are not necessarily bounded, hence completing the results established in [13] for bounded linear operators. Our main applications deal with various nonlinear boundary value problems and parabolic initial value equations governed by the transport operator with or without a diffusion term. Comment: 30 pages.

The carrier gas line The GC carrier gas should be at least 99. 999 % helium (called “five nines ” helium). Lower grades of helium are available and can con-tain impurities that can damage the GC column (e. g., oxygen) and contribute to the chemical noise background. Even with a high purity gas there may be trace water, oxygen and hydrocarbons. Putting a trap in the carrier line will eliminate these contaminants (see Figure 1). The mass spec-trometer gas purifier trap is recommended and shipped with Trace level GC/MS analysis requires a system that is per-forming at its best. Without a properly optimized GC, the mass spectrometer may not give the sensitivity expected. In other words, when more of the sample gets from the injection port to the ion source, the more likely a detector will produce a signal. Also, if the chemical noise from the GC is too high, the signal-to-noise ratio and ability to detect small analyte concentrations will be reduced.
