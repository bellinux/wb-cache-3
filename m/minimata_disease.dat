5000|$|In {{the summer}} and winter of 2009, hair samples from 1,137 Taiji {{residents}} were tested for mercury by the National Institute for <b>Minimata</b> <b>Disease</b> (NIMD). None of the Taiji residents, however, displayed any symptoms of mercury poisoning, according to the Institute. Despite the claim made by Boyd Harnell, the special correspondent to The Japan Times, that the mortality rate for Taiji and nearby Koazagawa, where dolphin meat is also consumed, is [...] "over 50% higher than the rate for similarly-sized villages throughout Japan" [...] using data from Japan's National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, {{it was revealed that}} the comparison was not suitable due to the huge gap in the villages' age profile. While Taiji and Kozagawa showed 34.9 percent and 44 percent of the population were over 65 years old, the compared villages showed 21 percent to 27.9 percent.|$|E
