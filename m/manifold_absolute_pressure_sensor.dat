50|$|The <b>manifold</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> (MAP sensor) {{is one of}} {{the sensors}} used in an {{internal}} combustion engine's electronic control system.|$|E
50|$|One {{approach}} used {{to mitigate the}} problem has been to reduce the boost pressure, which reduces the required venting volume and yields less charge over-calculation by the ECU. The air can also be recirculated back into the intake, a typical stock setup for cars with an upstream MAF sensor. The situation can also be corrected by switching the fuel metering system over to a <b>manifold</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor,</b> a conversion that usually requires a compatible aftermarket ECU or piggy-back fuel controller. The MAP sensor monitors the absolute pressure in the manifold at all times and will correctly detect the change that occurs when the valve vents, allowing the ECU to reduce fuel metering accordingly.|$|E
50|$|Engines {{that use}} a MAP sensor are {{typically}} fuel injected. The <b>manifold</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> provides instantaneous manifold pressure {{information to the}} engine's electronic control unit (ECU). The data {{is used to calculate}} air density and determine the engine's air mass flow rate, which in turn determines the required fuel metering for optimum combustion (see stoichiometry) and influence the advance or retard of ignition timing. A fuel-injected engine may alternatively use a mass airflow sensor (MAF sensor) to detect the intake airflow. A typical naturally aspirated engine configuration employs one or the other, whereas forced induction engines typically use both; a MAF sensor on the intake tract pre-turbo and a MAP sensor on the charge pipe leading to the throttle body.|$|E

5000|$|The Trionic T5.2 uses a Mecel {{patented}} ion-current measurement1 {{to decide}} which cylinder was in the compression phase and had just ignited the air/fuel mixture.

The Z28 was still powered by a 350 CID L V8, however due to new emissions regulations the engine was now equipped with a CCC (Computer Command Control) unit for the first time. This predecessor to modern engine control modules had an oxygen sensor, an electronically controlled carburetor, a throttle position sensor, coolant sensors, a barometric pressure sensor, a <b>Manifold</b> <b>Absolute</b> <b>Pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> (MAP), and a check engine light on the dash. The transmission was now equipped with a lockup torque converter, controlled by the CCC as well. The CCC could also be used as a self-diagnostic tool.

Canadian models, however, could still get the 350 and 4-speed combination, and were not equipped with a CCC. Canadian 1981 Camaros were thus identical to 1980 US model. RS models were dropped this year, but the RS designation would reappear in 1989. Total production had dropped down to 126,139 from a high of 282,571 in 1979.|$|E
50|$|The {{most notable}} {{change of the}} RC45 when {{released}} {{was the use of}} Programmed Fuel Injection. Fuel injection had been used on bikes previously but these had either been rather antiquated analog computers or very simple digital units with a minimal number of sensors for input, which resulted in very crude fueling. The RC30 had used 38 mm constant velocity carburettors which, for road use are quite nice, maintaining a high air velocity across a wide rpm range, though were not as well suited for racing. The RC45 did away with carburetors and in their absence a brace of four 46 mm throttles were replaced, Honda now had the throttle area it needed to make big horsepower at high revolutions. The system Honda used on the RC45 was very similar to the system used on the NR750. Contrary to popular belief the RC45’s fuel injection is not like a 4-stage carburetor, rather it is a proper fuel only system. Honda kept the ignition system separate. The Honda system obtained information from the following sensors: crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor, air temperature sensor, coolant temperature sensor, <b>manifold</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor,</b> throttle position sensor, barometric sensor and battery voltage. With all of these sensors relaying information to the ECU, Honda could have quite easily incorporated the ignition control unit. The reason that they had not came down to the supplier of parts: they had different manufacturers supplying the ecu and cdi units. Regardless, it allowed the use of very large throttle plates seamlessly over a very wide engine operating range. The engine of the RC45 also used many magnesium castings, as of rather recently, it has become quite common to see fuel injection and magnesium engine parts on motorcycles, though in the early-to-mid 1990’s this was expensive and incredibly innovative.|$|E

This article presents a novel method of changing the ignition curve in an LPG/Gasoline bi-fuel engines which still use the converter and mixer models. The goal {{of this research was}} to get the best engine power in fuel operating mode both gasoline and LPG. It is known that the gasoline and LPG have different properties, especially burning speeds. In order to obtain optimum engine performance in both fuels, there should be two ignition curves, one for gasoline and the other for LPG. A circuit Simple Electronic Spark Module (SESM) was applied to manipulate the feedback voltage from a <b>Manifold</b> <b>Absolute</b> <b>Pressure</b> <b>Sensor</b> (MAPS). In the gasoline mode when idle, feedback from the MAPS was 1. 4 volts.

40|$|The {{critical}} {{product planning}} phase, {{early in the}} product development cycle, requires a design tool to set engineering priorities, capable of selecting the preferred design concept and setting target levels of engineering performance to guide the later product development stages, while considering the needs of both the consumer and producer. The Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method was developed to transfer customer needs into engineering characteristics; however, limitations {{have been identified in}} using QFD, which can result in irrational and unrealistic results when used to set engineering priorities and target levels of product performance. In this paper, based on the principles of Decision-Based Design (DBD), a new design tool called the Product Attribute Function Deployment (PAFD) is demonstrated as a decision-theoretic, enterprise-wide process tool to guide the conceptual design phase. The PAFD method extends the qualitative matrix principles of QFD while utilizing the quantitative decision making processes of DBD to create a new process specifically for translating qualitative customer needs into quantitative engineering attributes and making early product design decisions. It is built upon established methods in engineering, marketing, and decision analysis to eliminate the need for subjective user ratings. In addition, the technical attributes considered are expanded beyond those typically considered to include requirements from the producer and regulators.

A steel cable connected the accelerator pedal inside the vehicle to a mechanical linkage {{at the side of the}} throttle body, which acted to open the air intake butterfly valves inside the venturis. During idle these butterfly valves were closed, so a bypass port and the IAC valve were used to control the intake of air.|$|R

40|$|Most {{motorcycles}} {{in developing}} countries use carburetor systems as fuel delivery method especially for models with cubic capacity of less than 350 cc. However, small gasoline carbureted engines suffer from low operating efficiency, high fuel consumption and high level of hazardous emissions. In recent years, Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) technology {{has been applied to}} small engine motorcycles as well. EFI system has better fuel economy and can reduce harmful emissions by correctly calculating suitable amount of fuel to be injected into the combustion chamber. One way to achieve this is by accurately estimate the engine load by using the in-cylinder Air Mass Flow (AMF) rate of the engine. Most of the control schemes in modern system either approximate the AMF near the throttle plate using Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor or in the intake <b>manifold</b> using <b>Manifold</b> <b>Absolute</b> <b>Pressure</b> (MAP) <b>sensor.</b> This work presents a more economical approach to estimate the AMF by using only the measurements of throttle position and engine speed, that is, without using the MAF sensor or the MAP sensor to estimate the AMF in intake manifold, resulting in lower implementation cost. The estimation is done via two-stage multilayer feed-forward neural network with combinations of Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm, Bayesian Regularization (BR) algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Based on the results in 20 runs, the second variant of hybrid algorithm yields a better network performance with a mean squared error (MSE) of 1. 8308 by estimating the AMF closely to the simulated AMF values compared to using the first variant of hybrid algorithm (MSE of 2. 8906), LM (MSE of 8. 0525), LM with BR (MSE of 3. 5657) and PSO (MSE of 133. 7900) alone.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the air fuel ratio within the stoichiometric operating window, which is necessary for efficient catalytic converter operation an accurate estimation of the mass airflow at the engine ports is critical. It is difficult to accurately represent the port air mass flow of an Internal Combustion Spark Ignition engine as reciprocating engines are complex non-linear systems based on a large number of interrelated parameters. Conventional air fuel ratio control strategies use a number of three dimensional feedforward look up tables to represent these complex nonlinear engine functions. These look up tables are usually functions of only two engine variables, engine speed and engine load. Engine load is either, calculated from the speed density relationship using an <b>absolute</b> <b>manifold</b> air <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> or measured directly using a mass air flow sensor. Conventional AFR control algorithms perform poorly during transient conditions as the strategies inherent in look up tables, are based on stationary or non-dynamic modelling techniques. Modern air fuel ratio control strategies employ a large number of correction factors to compensate for transient engine operation. This research is a preliminary investigation into the feasibility of using Artificial Neural Networks to represent transient nonlinear engine functions. This research develops offline artificial neural network models of the port air mass flow of a Spark Ignition, based on Hendricks' et al [1] accepted mean value engine model description of the manifold filling phenomena. In particular two different Artificial Neural Network paradigms, namely the Backpropagation algorithm and the fast converging Optimise Layer by Layer algorithm will be trained on data collected through both steady state and transient chassis dynamometer testing. Both steady state and transient air mass flow models will be developed in this investigation. The accuracy of the Backpropagation and Optimised Layer by Layer models will be analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively and compared in terms of the Root Mean Squared percentage error and computational time in an effort to evaluate the most appropriate model for future online engine implementation...|$|R
