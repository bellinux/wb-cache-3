40|$|Speech {{synthesis}} {{is an area}} {{of computer}} science with many practical uses, such as enabling people with visual impairments to take part of text and to provide more human-like feedback from information systems. A similar area of research is text-to-song, where systems comparable to those used in text-to-speech pro- vide mappings from text to melodic units of song. This paper discusses how a text-to-song algorithm can be developed and what parameters affect what emotion is communicated. Fifty participants listened to music generated with our algorithm. Results show that tempo and mode both heavily account for what emotion is communicated; a melody performed with a tempo of 250 bpm was perceived as significantly more happy than a performance with a tempo of 120 bpm, and a <b>melody</b> <b>in</b> <b>major</b> tonality was perceived as significantly more happy than a melody in minor tonality. Combined, these parameters gave even more significant results. A fast tempo combined with major tonality produced a performance that was perceived as even more happy. The opposite was observed when a slow tempo was combined with minor tonality. When a fast tempo was combined with a minor tonality the average answer was neu- tral with answers distributed over the whole spectrum from sad to happy. A slow tempo combined with a major tonality gave almost identical results. We concluded that generating emotionally expressive song with the use of an al- gorithm is definitely possible, but that the methodology can be improved in order to convey emotions even more clearly. ...|$|E

5000|$|Musicologists Leon Plantinga and Alexander Ringer {{claim that}} the {{inspiration}} for the Eroica theme may have come from Classical era composer Muzio Clementi. Plantinga theorizes that a source may be Clementi's Piano Sonata in F minor, Op. 13, No. 6 (composed in 1784) where the first seven or eight notes of the Eroica theme can be matched, with a simpler rhythm, with the beginning of the third movement (in a minor key), and later to the <b>melody</b> <b>in</b> a <b>major</b> key (the Eroica theme is <b>in</b> a <b>major</b> key although there are variations in minor keys). [...] Ringer points to the first movement of the Piano Sonata in G minor, Op. 7, No. 3 (composed in 1782) as a possible source, where the <b>melody</b> (<b>in</b> a minor key) and rhythm closely match the first eight bars of the Eroica theme. (A major version also exists in the movement, matching very closely the <b>melody</b> <b>in</b> the <b>major</b> key from the F minor, Op. 13, No. 6 sonata).|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that memory for music possesses a number of similarities to the more frequently studied modalities of verbal and visual memory. The present study addresses a yet uninvestigated factor involved in the memory for music: mood. Specifically, the study explored whether a mood-congruency effect is attained using major and minor keys as memory stimuli. Sixty undergraduate students were placed in a positive, negative, or neutral (i. e. baseline) mood. They were then presented with four major and four minor melodies, and, following a short delay, underwent a recognition task for the melodies. The results showed {{the presence of a}} highly significant mood-congruency effect. In a positive mood, <b>melodies</b> <b>in</b> <b>major</b> keys were better recognized than <b>melodies</b> <b>in</b> minor keys, whereas the reverse effect was seen for negative moods.

5000|$|One of {{his last}} works, {{haunting}} and full of mystery, the Nocturne <b>in</b> B <b>major</b> opens with what {{might be described as}} a bard's striking of the strings. This rolled C# minor chord sounds dramatic in the home-key of B-major, since it functions as the V/V harmonically. After the simple introductory chords, a simple <b>melody</b> <b>in</b> B <b>major</b> emerges. At first, the action proceeds gently and smoothly (dolce, legato). But the song soon turns into declamation, led by a lofty, dramatic raised voice, and after a flashy scale in the right hand, Chopin leads us to the B section of this ternary formed (ABA) nocturne.|$|R
5|$|The Thirteen Colonies of the {{original}} United States were all former English possessions, and Anglo culture became a major foundation for American folk and popular music. Many American folk songs are identical to British songs in arrangements, but with new lyrics, often as parodies of {{the original}} material. American-Anglo songs are also characterized as having fewer pentatonic tunes, less prominent accompaniment (but with heavier use of drones) and more <b>melodies</b> <b>in</b> <b>major.</b> Anglo-American traditional music also includes a variety of broadside ballads, humorous stories and tall tales, and disaster songs regarding mining, shipwrecks, and murder. Legendary heroes like Joe Magarac, John Henry, and Jesse James are part of many songs. Folk dances of British origin include the square dance, descended from the quadrille, combined with the American innovation of a caller instructing the dancers. The religious communal society known as the Shakers emigrated from England during the 18th century and developed their own folk dance style. Their early songs can be dated back to British folk song models. Other religious societies established their own unique musical cultures early in American history, such as {{the music of the}} Amish, the Harmony Society, and the Ephrata Cloister in Pennsylvania.|$|R

5000|$|Simon Morrison {{notes that}} [...] "in {{explicit}} {{contrast to the}} reality of mass incarceration, starvation, and execution, and similar propaganda works offer benign images of resplendent harvests and harmonious labor". The cantata opens with a sighing motif on trumpets, after which the strings play an expansive, flowing <b>melody</b> <b>in</b> C <b>major.</b> The choir suddenly enters, and the music picks up speed. The choir slips cheekily into distant keys now and then, but the harmonic language contains nothing too 'unorthodox' which would have been anathema to Soviet musical strictures.

5000|$|The third {{movement}} scherzo {{opens with}} pizzicato cellos accompanying a lilting oboe <b>melody</b> <b>in</b> G <b>major.</b> A contrasting section in [...] time marked Presto ma non assai {{begins in the}} strings, and this theme is soon {{taken over by the}} full orchestra (minus trumpets). Bar 107 returns to the main tempo and gentle mood, but the idyll setting is again disrupted in bar 126 when the earlier Presto marking makes a re-entry, this time in a [...] variation.

40|$|Ten musicians {{were asked}} to {{describe}} the quality or char-acter evoked by different scale tones <b>in</b> the Western <b>major</b> scale. For example, the “mediant ” pitch was variously described by participants as light, lifted, restful, peaceful, warm, bright, or calm. An informal semantic analysis of the descriptive terms resulted in seven categories, includ-ing the categories of surprise, tendency and completion. Independently, statistical data were collected on the prob-ability of different scale tones in a large sample of Western <b>melodies</b> <b>in</b> <b>major</b> keys. There appears to be a notable as-sociation between the subjective qualia reported by musi-cians and the basic statistical properties of scale tones for Western melodies. Scale tones described by musicians as surprising or unexpected have objectively lower zeroth-order probabilities of occurrence. Scale tones character-ized as tending, leading, or pointing, {{are more likely to be}} those tones that are objectively most highly constrained in their first-order melodic probabilities. Scale tones de-scribed as stable or restful, are more likely to be those tones that exhibit a high probability of terminating a phrase or work. Most of the qualia categories, including certainty, tendency, completion, mobility and stability ap-pear to be readily interpreted as relating to the statistical properties of tones and tone successions. These informal observations are consistent with the idea that the subjective experiential qualia evoked by tones may be attributable to statistical learning...|$|R

As a composition befitting the wedding of the royalty, the waltz has its moments of grandeur (Section 3) where a triumphant <b>melody</b> <b>in</b> the home key of C major gave way into a rousing Viennese tune <b>in</b> F <b>major.</b> The waltz has only 4 two-part sections as opposed to the earlier pattern of 5 two-part sections propounded by Josef Lanner and his father Johann Strauss I.
