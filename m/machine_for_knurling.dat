50|$|A popular myth is that rolled knurls are {{somewhat}} more complicated to design than cut knurls because the outer {{diameter of the}} work piece must be chosen to allow the roller to roll an integral number of patterns around the workpiece, in practice if the knurl is applied positively, it will engage with its own impression and create a proper knurl on any diameter of work. The integer number of <b>knurls</b> <b>for</b> any given diameter typically varies by three repetitions from the bottom {{to the top of}} the pattern. By comparison, <b>for</b> cut <b>knurls,</b> the spacing of the cuts is not preset and can be adjusted to allow an integral number of patterns around the workpiece no matter what the diameter of the workpiece.|$|R

40|$|Maria J. Munoz Vasa is {{a program}} manager at Raytheon Company. The {{subjects}} in this study were from an unidentified company in a large city. Abstract: Ten male and 13 female assembly line manufacturing workers exerted MVC torques on small (smooth and knurled) cylindrical handles of diameters 3. 3, 5. 0, 6. 4, 9. 5, and 19. 0 mm. Three other handles with flanged finger contact were also tested to simulate torqueing on a specific medical device. The flange widths were 6. 4, 9. 5, and 19. 0 mm (6 mm high). Both loosening and tightening exertions were tested. Each subject performed 26 different torque exertions. The results indicated that finger torque strength decreased steadily with diameter of the cylindrical handle, or with the width of the flange. Torque was also stronger for tightening compared to loosening, and <b>for</b> <b>knurled</b> cylinders compared with smooth ones. There were 2 -factor interaction effects on torque – surface*direction, surface*diameter and diameter*direction for the cylinders; and direction*width for the flanges, indicating that the change in torque over one factor is not independent of all other factors...|$|R
