40|$|The <b>Ozone</b> <b>Transport</b> Assessment Group (OTAG) has {{identified}} <b>ozone</b> <b>transport</b> {{as a contributor}} to ozone exceedances in the eastern U. S. EPA has issued the NOx SIP Call that requires deep NOx emission controls on major stationary sources (mainly utility sources) as a “cost-effective” approach for reducing <b>ozone</b> <b>transport</b> from upwind states on downwind “nonattainment”. However, the technical analyses on which EPA based their NOx SIP Call overstated the contributions of <b>ozone</b> <b>transport,</b> incorrectly evaluated the ozone contributions of the sources that were controlled in the SIP Call, inappropriately examined other levels of control, and used a measure of “cost-effectiveness ” that {{was not related to}} achieving any ozone reductions.

The <b>ozone</b> vertical <b>transport</b> is mainly from the stratosphere to the troposphere.

In this budget analysis, the chemical net production term, which is calculated as the residual of the other terms, displays the correct features of a chemical sink and source term, including location and seasonality, and shows good agreement in magnitude compared to other methods of calculating ozone loss rates. This study provides further insight {{into the role of}} the eddy <b>ozone</b> <b>transport</b> and underlines its fundamental role in the recovery of the ozone hole during spring. The trend analysis reveals that the ozone hole intensification over the 1980 – 2001 period is not solely related to the trend in chemical losses, but more specifically to the balance between the trends in chemical losses and <b>ozone</b> <b>transport.</b> That is because, in the Southern Hemisphere from October to December, the large increase in the chemical destruction of ozone is balanced by an equally large trend in the eddy transport, associated with a small increase in the mean transport. This study shows that the increase in the eddy transport is characterized by more poleward ozone eddy flux by transient waves in the midlatitudes and by stationary waves in the polar region. Overall, this study makes clearer the close interaction between the trends in ozone chemistry and <b>ozone</b> <b>transport.</b> It reveals that the eddy <b>ozone</b> <b>transport</b> and its long-term changes are an important natural mitigation mechanism for the ozone hole.

The buildup of total ozone at high latitudes during winter is dependent upon transient planetary wave activity of sufficient strength to cause the breakdown of the polar vortex. While midwinter warmings are responsible for enhanced <b>ozone</b> <b>transport</b> to high latitudes, the final warming marking the transition from zonal mean westerlies to zonal mean easterlies is the most important event leading to the spring maximum.

30|$|In summary, we have {{identified}} several problems with TCO-based tropical width. Broadly, these problems relate to the complex iterative algorithm employed previously, inhomogeneities in the TCO data, and the relatively small component of TCO variability that {{can be explained by}} latitudinal variations in the tropopause break. However, in principle, the strong <b>meridional</b> <b>ozone</b> gradient in the lower stratosphere should be a good marker of the location of the tropopause break. Given the potential temporal inhomogeneities in reanalysis fields, there is a justified desire for robust observationally based metrics of tropical width that do not rely on reanalysis output. It is possible that vertically resolved ozone measurements could be used to address this issue, although the duration and reliability of such measurements may be limited {{to the point that it}} is not possible to confidently use them for trend detection.

40|$|An {{intensive}} observation with ozonesondes and rawinsondes {{was conducted}} in Indonesia in May and June 1995 to investigate a phenomenon of ozone enhancement in the tropical upper troposphere. We obtained the characteristics of an enhancement that continued for about 20 days, concurring with a zonal wind oscillation associated with the equatorial Kelvin wave around the tropopause and the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) in the troposphere. The isoline of ozone mixing ratio of 40 nmol/mol moved by 5. 0 km downward from 17. 8 km to 12. 8 km, while the tropopause height was 16. 2 – 17. 8 km throughout the period. Moreover, the maximum ozone concentration of 300 nmol/mol at the tropopause was concurrent with the maximum eastward wind phase of the Kelvin wave. The detailed mechanism of the <b>ozone</b> <b>transport</b> is interpreted as follows: The downward motion associated with the Kelvin wave and the MJO <b>transported</b> the stratospheric <b>ozone</b> into the troposphere, and the air mixing due to the Kelvin wave breaking at the tropopause also caused stratosphere-troposphere exchange.

Thin cirrus clouds were found at the tropopause {{on each of the}} four flights which penetrated within 15 degrees of the equator at 200 - 210 east longitude. The altitudes of these clouds exceeded 18 km at times. The cirrus observations could be divided into two basic types - thin quasi-laminar wisps and thicker, more textured structures. Based on trajectory analyses and temperature histories, these two types were usually formed respectively by: (1) in situ cooling on both a synoptic scale and mesoscale; and (2) recent (a few days) outflow from convection. There is evidence from one case that the thicker clouds can also be formed by in situ cooling. The actual presence or absence of thin cirrus clouds was also consistent the temperature and convective histories derived from back trajectory calculations. Notably, at any given time, only a relatively small portion (at most 25 %) of the west central tropical Pacific has been influenced by convection within the previous 10 days.

40|$|We aim to {{reconcile}} the recently published, apparently contrasting results regarding {{the relative importance of}} tropical upwelling versus horizontal transport for the seasonality of ozone above the tropical tropopause. Different analysis methods in the literature (Lagrangian versus Eulerian, and isentropic versus pressure vertical coordinates) yield different perspectives of <b>ozone</b> <b>transport,</b> and the results must be carefully compared in equivalent terms to avoid misinterpretation. By examining the Lagrangian calculations in the Eulerian formulation, we show here that the results are in fact consistent {{with each other and with}} a common understanding of the <b>ozone</b> <b>transport</b> processes near and above the tropical tropopause. We further emphasize that the complementary approaches are suited for answering two different scientific questions: (1) what drives the observed seasonal cycle in ozone at a particular level above the tropical tropopause? and (2) how important is horizontal transport from mid-latitudes for ozone concentrations in the tropical lower stratosphere? Regarding the first question, the analysis of the Transformed Eulerian Mean (TEM) ozone budget shows that the annual cycle in tropical upwelling is the main forcing of the ozone seasonality at altitudes with large vertical gradients in the tropical lower stratosphere.

40|$|An {{important}} key for {{the understanding}} of the dynamic response to large tropical volcanic eruptions is the warming of the tropical lower stratosphere and the concomitant intensification of the polar vortices. Although this mechanism is reproduced by most general circulation models today, most models still fail in producing an appropriate winter warming pattern in the Northern Hemisphere. In this study ensemble sensitivity experiments were carried out with a coupled atmosphere-ocean model to assess the influence of different ozone climatologies on the atmospheric dynamics and in particular on the northern hemispheric winter warming. The ensemble experiments were perturbed by a single Tambora-like eruption. Larger meridional gradients in the lower stratospheric ozone favor the coupling of zonal wind anomalies between the stratosphere and the troposphere after the eruption. The associated sea level pressure, temperature, and precipitation patterns are more pronounced and the northern hemispheric winter warming is highly significant. Conversely, weaker <b>meridional</b> <b>ozone</b> gradients lead to a weaker response of the winter warming and the associated patterns.
