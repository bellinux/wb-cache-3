Objectives were to use new microprocessor technology to produce one terminal that is more effective and efficient than either the management terminal or the plasma type interactive terminal presently in use by the Air Force Advanced Instructional System (AIS). -Four goals were, identified:. (1) deSign and develop a final configuration which takes into account stand-alone software. capabilities for supperting block testing, portability (battery operation), and transfer of data to the computer site through a type B terminal; () refine the existing proiotype,for production level numbers, and produce ten prototype production units with a production cost goal of appioximately $ 500. 00 fer unit in quantities of 500 or more; (3) perform a classroom study of the <b>microterminal</b> to determine its operational'effectiveness; and (4) provide complete procurement-manufacturing dOcumentatiOn. "ThroUgh involvetent of educators, psychologists, engineer?, and potential <b>microterminal</b> users, the humam factors were efined, mechanical and electrical characteristics of the microtermi al selected, and the protOtype designed. The <b>microterminal</b> was ev luated and proved acceptable for student test taking in the AI weapons mechanics course. Cost analysis indicated that it met the goal.

Numerical calculations based on the theory show close agreement with computer simulations. They also provide valuable guides to system design. For a particular example we find that speech activity detection permits 37 speech terminals to share a PRMA channel with 20 slots per frame, with a packet dropping probability of less than 1 %.
