25|$|The {{combined}} stylus motion can {{be represented}} {{in terms of the}} vector sum and difference of the two stereo channels.

50|$|The {{combined}} stylus motion is, {{in terms}} of the vector, the sum and difference of the two stereo channels. Effectively, all horizontal stylus motion conveys the L+R sum signal, and vertical stylus motion carries the L−R difference signal. The advantages of the 45/45 system are that it has greater compatibility with <b>monophonic</b> <b>recording</b> and playback systems.|$|R

5000|$|Although Decca had {{recorded}} Ansermet's conducting of Antar in stereo May 1954 {{it took four}} years for the first stereo LPs to be sold. In 1958, {{the first group of}} mass-produced stereo two-channel vinyl records was issued, by Audio Fidelity in the USA and Pye in Britain, using the Westrex [...] "45/45" [...] single-groove system. Whereas the stylus moves horizontally when reproducing a <b>monophonic</b> disk <b>recording,</b> on stereo records, the stylus moves vertically as well as horizontally. One could envision a system in which the left channel was recorded laterally, as on a <b>monophonic</b> <b>recording,</b> with the right channel information recorded with a [...] "hill and dale" [...] vertical motion; such systems were proposed but not adopted, due to their incompatibility with existing phono pickup designs (see below).|$|R

(However, many monophonic styli had such low vertical compliance that they plowed through the vertical modulation, destroying the stereo information. This led to the common recommendation never to use a mono cartridge on a stereo record.) Conversely, a stereo cartridge reproduces the lateral grooves of <b>monophonic</b> <b>recording</b> equally through both channels, rather than one channel; ...|$|R
