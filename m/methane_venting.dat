40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the characteristics of magnetic variability and their possible implication for sub-sea <b>methane</b> <b>venting,</b> magnetic susceptibility (MS) of 145 surface sediment samples from the southern South China Sea (SCS) was investigated. Magnetic particles extracted from 20 representative samples were also examined for their mineral, chemical compositions and micromorphology. Results indicate that MS values range between - 7. 73 x 10 (- 8) and 45. 06 x 10 (- 8) m(3) /kg. The high MS zones occur at some hydrocarbon-bearing basins and along main tectonic zones, and low ones are distributed mainly within the river delta or along continental shelves. Iron concretions and manganese concretions are not main contributors for high MS values in sediments, while authigenic iron sulphide minerals are possibly responsible for the MS enhancement. This phenomenon is suspected to be produced by the reducing environment where the high upward venting methane beneath the seafloor reacts with seawater sulfate, resulting in seep precipitation of highly susceptible intermediate mineral pyrrhotite, greigite and paramagnetic pyrite. It suggests that MS variability is possibly one of the geochemical indicators for mapping sub-sea zones of <b>methane</b> <b>venting</b> in the southern SCS...|$|E

We identify three invasion regimes: capillary fingering, viscous fingering, and “capillary fracturing,” where capillary forces overcome frictional resistance and induce the opening of conduits. We derive two dimensionless numbers that govern the transition among the different regimes: a modified capillary number and a fracturing number.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of methane transport in lake sediments control {{the release of}} methane into the water column above, and the portion that reaches the atmosphere may con-tribute significantly to the greenhouse effect. The observed dynamics are poorly understood. In particular, variations in the hydrostatic load on the sediments, from both water level and barometric pressure, appear to trigger free gas bubbling (ebulli-tion). We develop a model of methane bubble flow through the sediments, forced by changes in hydrostatic load. The mechanistic, numerical model is tuned to and com-pared against ebullition data from Upper Mystic Lake, MA, and the predictions match the daily temporal character of the observed gas releases.

However, the role <b>methane</b> <b>vents</b> play in both climate change and chemosynthetic life remains controversial primarily {{because we do not}} understand long-term methane flux and the mechanisms that control it ([Milkov et al., 2004], [Shakhova et al., 2010] and [Van Dover, 2000]). Vents are inherently dynamic and flux varies greatly in magnitude and even flow direction over short time periods (hours-to-days), often tidally-driven ([Boles et al., 2001] and [Tryon et al., 1999]). But, it remains unclear if flux changes at vents occur on the order of the life-cycle of various species within chemosynthetic communities (months, years, to decades [Leifer et al., 2004] and [Torres et al., 2001]) and thus impacts their sustainability. Here, using repeat high-resolution 3 D seismic surveys acquired in 2000 and 2008, we demonstrate in 4 D that Hydrate Ridge, a vent off the Oregon coast has undergone significant reduction of methane flow and complete interruption in just the past few years. In the subsurface, below a frozen methane hydrate layer, free gas appears to be migrating toward the vent, but currently there is accumulating gas that is unable to reach the seafloor through the gas hydrate layer. At the same time, abundant authigenic carbonates show that the system has been active for several thousands of years. Thus, it is likely that activity has been intermittent because gas hydrates clog the vertical flow pathways feeding the seafloor vent. Back pressure building in the subsurface will ultimately trigger hydrofracturing that will revive fluid-flow to the seafloor. The nature of this mechanism implies regular recurring flow interruptions and methane flux changes that threaten the viability of chemosynthetic life, but simultaneously and enigmatically sustains it...|$|R

High methane concentrations (exceeding 10. 000 μM) in sediments, which when extrapolated, suggest that saturation might be reached at about 16 - 24 mbsf at which depths the shallowest gas hydrates might be encountered in the area.

40|$|After the {{discovery}} in 1999 {{of a series}} of mud volcanoes on the deep basin floors of Lake Baikal and of the presence of an anomalous thermally-mixed water layer attributed to <b>methane</b> <b>venting,</b> the lake floor was investigated in more detail in order to identify all possible sources of methane and to understand the processes leading to mud volcanism and methane release at the Baikal lake floor. New data show the presence of at least 4 mud volcano provinces, each consisting of several individual mud volcano structures, and of several areas of gas venting. All mud volcanoes occur in water depths of > 1000 m, within the GHSZ and in areas of abnormally shallow BSR, and are closely associated to large, active faults. They are attributed to hydrate destabilisation {{at the base of the}} GHSZ under the influence of a geothermal fluid pulse along the nearby fault. Methane release is not continuous (probably tectonically controlled; most mud volcanous are not active at present) and the source of methane is destabilising gas hydrates at 200 - 300 m subbottom depth. In addition, a whole series of methane vents (i. e. without distinct morphological expression) occur in shallower-water areas. These venting sites occur mostly in deltaic environments, but some are also associated with faults, and are always outside the GHSZ. Methane release appears to be more continuous (many are now active) and the source of the methane is probably shallow subsurface methane formed by the decomposition of organic matter, although deeper sources can not be excluded. Consequences of <b>methane</b> <b>venting</b> for the waters of Lake Baikal are the presence of a thermally-mixed water layer, wich could (if persisting and increasing in thickness) lead to a permanent stratification of the water column. This could influence the water mixing process and have major influences on the oxygenation of the lake and the benthic biota. In addition, increasing evidence is becoming available that some of these seeps may influence the water column (directly, or via associated temperature-driven circulation effects) up to the surface, causing localised melting or non-freezing of the winter-ice cover and even massive fish deaths. Measurements of surface-water and near-surface air methane concentrations are currently underway.

Notable {{progress has been}} made toward understanding anaerobic methane oxidation in marine sediments; however, the diversity and distribution of aerobic methanotrophs in the water column are poorly characterized. Both environments play an essential role in regulating methane release from the oceans to the atmosphere. In this study, the diversity of particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) and 16 S rRNA genes from two <b>methane</b> <b>vent</b> environments along the California continental margin was characterized. The pmoA phylotypes recovered from methane-rich sediments and the overlying water column differed. Sediments harbored the greatest number of unique pmoA phylotypes broadly affiliated with the Methylococcaceae family, whereas planktonic pmoA phylotypes formed three clades that were distinct from the sediment-hosted methanotrophs and distantly related to established methanotrophic clades. Water column-associated phylotypes were highly similar between field sites, suggesting that planktonic methanotroph diversity is controlled primarily by environmental factors rather than geographical proximity. Analysis of 16 S rRNA genes from methane-rich waters did not readily recover known methanotrophic lineages, with only a few phylotypes demonstrating distant relatedness to Methylococcus. The development of new pmo primers increased the recovery of monooxygenase genes from the water column and led to the discovery of a highly diverged monooxygenase sequence which is phylogenetically intermediate to Amo and pMMO. This sequence potentiates insight into the amo/pmo superfamily. Together, these findings lend perspective into the diversity and segregation of aerobic methanotrophs within different methane-rich habitats in the marine environment...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that volume expansion caused by hydrate dissociation in sediment pores can result in large overpressure, which in turn may destabilize the sediment and trigger massive submarine landslides. Here, we investigate the pressure evolution during thermally-induced dissociation, by means of a pore-scale model that couples dissociation kinetics, multiphase flow and geomechanics. Dissociation is controlled by a self-preservation mechanism: increasing pore pressure reduces the driving force for dissociation. Hence, the overpressure is constrained by the phase equilibrium pressure, regardless of the kinetic rate of dissociation, heat supply, and sediment permeability. Furthermore, we find that the timescale for buildup of pressure by dissociation is typically much larger than that for its dissipation by drainage. Consequently, the overpressure is controlled by the capillary entry thresholds, which depend on the mode of gas invasion. In low-permeability systems, fracturing is the preferred mechanism, occurring at capillary pressures lower than the entry thresholds in the undeformed sediment. Our results suggest that while large overpressures cannot be sustained by rapid dissociation in natural systems, dissociation can induce important geomechanical effects.

The fraction of methane emitted by sediments that bypasses dissolution {{in the water column}} and reaches the atmosphere as bubbles depends on the mode and spatiotemporal characteristics of venting from the sediments. Earlier studies have concluded that hot spots—persistent, high-flux vents—dominate the regional ebullitive flux from submerged sediments. Here the spatial structure, persistence, and variability in the intensity of <b>methane</b> <b>venting</b> are analyzed using a high-resolution multibeam sonar record acquired {{at the bottom of a}} lake during multiple deployments over a 9 month period.

Our analysis shows that the spatial pattern of ebullition becomes homogeneous at the sonar's resolution over time scales of hours (for high-flux periods) or days (for low-flux periods), demonstrating that vents are ephemeral rather than persistent, and suggesting that long-term, lake-wide ebullition dynamics may be modeled without resolving the fine-scale spatial structure of venting.

In many settings, the majority of methane is released through bubbling, and the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of this ebullition both presents challenges for measurement and impacts bubble dissolution and atmospheric emissions. Here we present laboratory-scale experiments of methane ebullition in a controlled incubation of reconstituted sediments from a eutrophic lake. Image analysis of a 0. 14 m 2 sediment surface area allowed identification of individual bubble outlets and resolved their location to ∼ 1 cm. While ebullition events were typically concentrated in bursts lasting ∼ 2 min, some major outlets showed persistent activity over the scale of days and even months. This persistence was surprising given the previously observed ephemerality of spatial structure at the field scale.

While foraminifera from some intervals have ? 13 C within the normal marine range (0 to - 1 ‰), five intervals are characterised by much lower ? 13 C, as low as - 17. 4 ‰. These intervals are interpreted to record the incorporation of 13 C-depleted carbon {{in the presence of}} methane emissions at the seafloor during biomineralization of the carbonate foraminiferal tests and subsequent secondary mineralization. Methane emission events (MEE) occur from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the Holocene, with the most prominent one, in terms of ? 13 C depletion, predating the Bølling-Allerød Interstadial (GI- 1 in the Greenland ice core record). The lack of correlation between the values of ? 13 C and ? 18 O, however, appears to preclude warming of bottom waters as the principal control on methane release. Rather, it seems likely that methane release is a consequence of episodicity in the supply of gas to the hydrate system and in the processes that enable methane gas to migrate through the hydrate stability field to the seabed, or of other geological processes still under debate...|$|E
40|$|Large {{volumes of}} magma emplaced within {{sedimentary}} basins {{have been linked}} to multiple climate change events due to release of greenhouse gases such as CH 4. Basin-scale estimates of thermogenic methane generation show that this process alone could generate enough greenhouse gases to trigger global incidents. However, the rates at which these gases are transported and released into the atmosphere are quantitatively unknown. We use a 2 D, hybrid FEM/FVM model that solves for fully compressible fluid flow to quantify the thermogenic release and transport of methane and to evaluate flow patterns within these systems. Our results show that the methane generation potential in systems with fluid flow does not significantly differ from that estimated in diffusive systems. The values diverge when vigorous convection occurs with a maximum variation of about 50 %. The fluid migration pattern around a cooling, impermeable sill alone generates hydrothermal plumes without the need for other processes such as boiling and/or explosive degassing. These fluid pathways are rooted {{at the edges of the}} outer sills consistent with seismic imaging. <b>Methane</b> <b>venting</b> at the surface occurs in three distinct stages and can last for hundreds of thousands of years. Our simulations suggest that although the quantity of methane potentially generated within the contact aureole can cause catastrophic climate change, the rate at which this methane is released into the atmosphere is too slow to trigger, by itself, some of the negative δ 13 C excursions observed in the fossil record over short time scales (< 10, 000 years) ...|$|E

40|$|During R. V. Sonne cruise SO 191 - 3, {{part of the}} New (Zealand Cold) Vents expedition, RCMG {{deployed}} a CHEROKEE ROV Genesis on the Hikurangi Margin. This accretionary margin, on {{the east}} coast of New Zealand, is related to the subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Australian Plate. Several cold vent locations as well as an extensive BSR, indicating the presence of gas hydrates, have been found at this margin. The aims of the ROV-work were to precisely localise active <b>methane</b> <b>vents,</b> to conduct detailed visual observations of the vent structures and activity, and to perform measurements of physical properties and collect samples at and around the vent locations. The three investigated areas generally have a flat to moderate undulating sea floor with soft sediments alternating with carbonate platforms. The different sites were sometimes covered with dense fields of live clams or shell debris, often in association with tube worms, sponges and/or soft tissue corals. Active bubble-releasing seeps were observed at Faures site and LM- 3 site. Bubble-releasing activity was very variable in time, with periods of almost non-activity alternating with periods of violent outbursts. Bubble release occurred mainly from prominent depressions in soft-sediment sea floor. Bottom-water sampling revealed sometimes high concentrations of methane. Sediment-temperature measurements were largely comparable with the bottom-water temperature except for a raindrop site (with dense populations of polychaetes), where anomalous low sediment-temperature was measured. Further analysis of the ROV data together with the integration of other datasets will enable us to produce a model characterising seep structure and environment...|$|R
