Lester was a high school coach and nobody had ever heard of him. I can't {{understand}} it. We had nine freshman who were All-Americans <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> here under Lester.

[...] Bump is not naïve – he knows that when you work at a place for 10 years and you’re not winning consistently, it doesn’t become fun for anybody – the coach, the alumni, the players or anybody else. [...] We talked about this {{and we talked about}} it openly. [...] If Bump had said to me, ‘Look, give me a couple of more years,’ I would have given it to him. [...] I mean that. [...] I didn’t fire Bump Elliott. [...] <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> as director Bump had an 8 and 2 record. [...] Anyone could live with that." ...|$|E

This is <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> with the team and I have had a great season. I really feel at home and I think the experiences we have gained this year, Lewis and myself, with working closely with the engineers and everyone in the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team means we can really build on this season for next year." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Salk: [...] "My {{intention}} {{was to go to}} medical school, and then become a medical scientist. I did not intend to practice medicine, although in medical school, and in my internship, I did all the things that were necessary to qualify me in that regard. I had opportunities along the way to drop the idea of medicine and go into science. At one point at the end of <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of medical school, I received an opportunity to spend a year in research and teaching in biochemistry, which I did. And {{at the end of that}} year, I was told that I could, if I wished, switch and get a Ph.D. in biochemistry, but my preference was to stay with medicine. And, I believe that this is all linked to my original ambition, or desire, which was to be of some help to humankind, so to speak, in a larger sense than just on a one-to-one basis." ...|$|E

Tracht attended DeWitt Clinton High School and graduated in 1968. He majored in broadcasting at Ithaca College and landed a job at the college radio station.

60|$|After a short {{probationary}} {{experience of}} such low convict employments as lime-burning and road-mending, I was advanced to occupations more {{in harmony with}} my education. Whatever I did, I never neglected the first great obligation of making myself agreeable and amusing to everybody. My social reputation as a good fellow began to stand as high {{at one end of}} the world as ever it stood at the other. The months passed more quickly than I had dared to hope. The expiration of <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of transportation was approaching, and already pleasant hints of my being soon assigned to private service began to reach my ears.

60|$|One {{day during}} my Cambridge days--it {{must have been}} in <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> before I knew Hatherleigh--I saw in a print-shop window near the Strand an {{engraving}} of a girl that reminded me sharply of Penge and its dusky encounter. It was just a half length of a bare-shouldered, bare-breasted Oriental with arms akimbo, smiling faintly. I looked at it, went my way, then turned back and bought it. I felt I must have it. The odd thing is that I {{was more than a little}} shamefaced about it. I did not have it framed and hung in my room open to the criticism of my friends, but I kept it in the drawer of my writing-table. And I kept that drawer locked for a year. It speedily merged with and became identified with the dark girl of Penge. That engraving became in a way my mistress. Often when I had sported my oak and was supposed to be reading, I was sitting with it before me.|$|E

60|$|Probably {{the second}} failure-breeding fault, lack of perseverance, {{has its roots}} in the first, at any rate in my case. At least on leaving college with some reputation, I was called to the Bar where, owing to certain {{solicitor}} and other connections, I had a good opening. Also, owing to the excellence of my memory and powers of work, I began very well, making money even during <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>year.</b> Then, as it happened, a certain case came my way and, my leader falling ill suddenly after it was opened, was left in my hands. The man whose cause I was pleading was, I think, one of the biggest scoundrels it is possible to conceive. It was a will case and if he won, the effect would be to beggar two most estimable middle-aged women who were justly entitled to the property, to which end personally I am convinced he had committed forgery; the perjury that accompanied it I do not even mention.|$|E

And here, except when I have the kids in {{gymnasium}} class, or when I'm chaperoning the basket-ball team on a trip out-of-town, I won't dare to move above a whisper. I guess they don't care much if you put any pep into teaching or not, as long as you look like a Good Influence out of school-hours--and that means never doing anything you want to. This normal course is bad enough, but the regular school will be FIERCE! If it wasn't too late to get a job in the Cities, I swear I'd resign here. I bet I won't dare to go to a single dance all winter. If I cut loose and danced the way I like to, they'd think I was a perfect hellion--poor harmless me! Oh, I oughtn't to be talking like this.

6000|$|There were {{classes in}} Electricity and Magnetism at the Grammar School. I {{took a little}} [...] "elementary" [...] prize in that in <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> and a medal in my third; and in Chemistry and Human Physiology and Sound, Light and Heat, I did well. There was also a lighter, more discursive subject called Physiography, in which one ranged among the {{sciences}} and encountered Geology {{as a process of}} evolution from Eozoon to Eastry House, and Astronomy as a record of celestial movements of the most austere and invariable integrity. I learnt out of badly-written, condensed little text-books, and with the minimum of experiment, but still I learnt. Only thirty years ago it was, and I remember I learnt of the electric light as an expensive, impracticable toy, the telephone as a curiosity, electric traction as a practical absurdity. There was no argon, no radium, no phagocytes--at least to my knowledge, and aluminium was a dear, infrequent metal. The fastest ships in the world went then at nineteen knots, and no one but a lunatic here and there ever thought it possible that men might fly.|$|E

6000|$|I {{had already}} a slight general notion of Italian letters from Leigh Hunt, {{and from other}} {{agreeable}} English Italianates; and I knew that I wanted to read not only the four great poets, Dante, Petrarch, Ariosto, and Tasso, but that whole group of burlesque poets, Pulci, Berni, and the rest, who, from what I knew of them, I thought {{would be even more}} to my mind. As a matter of fact, and in the process of time, I did read somewhat of all these, but rather in the minor than the major way; and I soon went off from them {{to the study of the}} modern poets, novelists, and playwrights who interested me so much more. After my wonted fashion I read half a dozen of these authors together, so that it would be hard to say which I began with, but I had really a devotion to Dante, though not at that time, or ever for the whole of Dante. During <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> in Venice I met an ingenious priest, who had been a tutor in a patrician family, and who was willing to lead my faltering steps through the [...] "Inferno."

60|$|The head-master was a clergyman, a good-humoured, easy-going man, as temperate, one had no doubt, in his {{religious}} life {{as in all}} else, and if he ever lost sleep on our account, it was from a very proper anxiety as to our gentility. I was in disgrace once because I went to school in some brilliant blue homespun serge my mother had bought in Devonshire, and I was told I must never wear it again. He had tried several times, though {{he must have known}} it was hopeless, to persuade our parents to put us into Eton clothes, and on certain days we were compelled to wear gloves. After <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>year,</b> we were forbidden to play marbles because it was a form of gambling and was played by nasty little boys, and a few months later told not to cross our legs in class. It was a school for the sons of professional men who had failed or were at the outset of their career, and the boys held an indignation meeting when they discovered that a new boy was an apothecary's son (I think at first I was his only friend,) and we all pretended that our parents were richer than they were. I told a little boy who had often seen my mother knitting or mending my clothes that she only mended or knitted because she liked it, though I knew it was necessity.|$|E
60|$|At Venice, if I {{was beyond}} the range of {{literary}} recognition I was in direct relations with one of our greatest literary men, who was again of that literary Boston which mainly represented American literature to me. The official chief of the consul at Venice was the United States Minister at Vienna, and in my time this minister was John Lothrop Motley, the historian. He was removed, later, by that Johnson administration which followed Lincoln's so forgottenly that I name it {{with a sense of}} something almost prehistoric. Among its worst errors was the attempted discredit {{of a man who had}} given lustre to our name by his work, and who was an ardent patriot as well as accomplished scholar. He visited Venice during <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>year,</b> which was the darkest period of the civil war, and I remember with what instant security, not to say severity, he rebuked my scarcely whispered misgivings of the end, when I ventured to ask him what he thought it would be. Austria had never recognized the Secessionists as belligerents, and in the complications with France and England there was little for our minister but to share the home indignation at the sympathy of those powers with the South. In Motley this was heightened by that feeling of astonishment, of wounded faith, which all Americans with English friendships experienced in those days, and which he, whose English friendships were many, experienced in peculiar degree.|$|E
