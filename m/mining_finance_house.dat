50|$|The Sierra Leone Selection Trust {{was formed}} in 1934 {{following}} an agreement between the government of Sierra Leone and the Consolidated African Selection Trust Ltd (CAST). CAST {{was formed in}} 1924 and {{was part of a}} much larger <b>mining</b> <b>finance</b> <b>house</b> Selection Trust Ltd which had been founded in 1913 by Alfred Chester Beatty (an American mining magnate. Although the Oppenheimers (De Beers) invested in CAST and its subsidiaries from the 1920s and had boardroom representation, CAST was independent of the Oppenheimer empire. SLST corporation which had exclusive mineral mining rights in Sierra Leone beginning in 1935 was scheduled to last for 99 years. In 1955, the SLST abandoned mineral mining and settled on mining the Yengema and Tongo Fields. However, with the creation of the Sierra Leonean parastatal National Diamond Mining Company in 1971, the diamond company was effectively nationalized, ending the SLST in Sierra Leone.|$|E
25|$|Within {{two years}} of gold being {{discovered}} on the Witwatersrand, four <b>mining</b> <b>finance</b> <b>houses</b> had been established. The first was formed by Hermann Eckstein in 1887, eventually becoming Rand Mines. Cecil Rhodes and Charles Rudd followed, with their Gold Fields of South Africa company. Rhodes and Rudd had earlier made fortunes from diamond mining at Kimberley. In 1895 there was an investment boom in Witwatersrand gold-mining shares. The precious metal that underpinned international trade would dominate South African exports for decades to come.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the support}} of foreign capital, the mines and the <b>mining</b> <b>finance</b> <b>houses,</b> largely {{dominated}} by English-speaking South Africans, prospered under the system of apartheid and shunned outright opposition. In return for the continued monopsony of labour purchase for the mines that kept wages low and outlawed trade unions, the English-speaking mining companies tolerated job reservation that prevented blacks from developing skills. [...] This is debated, however, as policies to restrict labour supply to whites only resulted in higher miner wages than under a system of equal employment.|$|R
40|$|Elinor Ostrom (2005 : 238) {{assumes that}} in {{understanding}} the make up and behaviour of institutional systems governing natural resources: “Resource users are explicitly thought of as rational egoists who plunder local resources so as to maximise their own short-term benefits. Government officials are implicitly depicted, on the other hand, as seeking, the more general public interest, having the relevant information at hand and the capability of designing optimal policies. ” This thesis examines the validity of this assumption through an historical analysis of the deep-level gold mining industry of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. The main focus of the assessment is on the institutions of ownership – that is, the development of mining rights and title legislation between 1886 and 2008. The study looks at the legislations’ transformation and implementation {{from the perspective of}} the gold mining industry – made up of the <b>mining</b> <b>finance</b> <b>houses</b> and the Chamber of Mines of South Africa – and that of the state. The transformation of the mining industry’s institutional framework was both a choice by government as well as that of the firms in the mining industry. The theoretical framework is constructed from four areas of economic thought. These include: the neoclassical and Keynesian schools of macroeconomic thought; industrial organisation and its relevance to the relationship between firms and the market; institutional and new institutional economics; and finally property rights. The determinants of policy design and the impact of such design on firms and industry is examined. The development, implementation and use of the aforementioned legislation is examined from two perspectives, namely, that of preserver or exploiter. Throughout the history of this prominent South African industry, the motivation for action from the industry or government has oscillated between the two extremes of preserver or exploiter over the time period examined. The conclusion is drawn on an overall and broad focus of actions – with a strong focus on the most recent developments in mining legislation – post- 1992...|$|R

During the period of rapid melt down of stock markets most of the share prices fell to their lowest levels. The movement of BSE sensex as well as five other top housing companies namely HDFC, LIC <b>Housing</b> <b>Finance,</b> GIC <b>Housing</b> <b>Finance,</b> Dewan <b>Housing</b> <b>Finance</b> Ltd and Canfinhomes were studies for a period of 5 years ie from March 2004 to March 2009 and the fluctuations of share prices during bullish and bearish trends were recorded. The study reveals that the proportion of systematic risk is more in HDFC Limited followed by LIC <b>Housing</b> <b>Finance</b> Limited, Can Fin Homes Limited and GIC <b>Housing</b> <b>Finance</b> Limited. Dewan <b>Housing</b> <b>Finance</b> Corporation Limited has very small proportion of systematic risk associated with it.
