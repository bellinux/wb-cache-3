5|$|The Seddon <b>Mayfly,</b> {{which was}} {{constructed}} in 1908, was an aircraft that was unsuccessful in early flight. The first aircraft designed by a woman, Lillian Bland, was titled the Bland <b>Mayfly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mayflies are {{involved}} in both primary production and bioturbation. A study in laboratory simulated streams revealed that the Centroptilum genus of the <b>mayfly</b> increased the export of periphyton, thus indirectly affecting primary production positively, which is an essential process for ecosystems. The <b>mayfly</b> can also reallocate and alter the nutrient availability in aquatic habitats {{through the process of}} bioturbation. By burrowing in the bottom of lakes and redistributing nutrients, mayflies indirectly regulate phytoplankton and epibenthic primary production. Once burrowing {{to the bottom of the}} lake, <b>mayfly</b> nymphs begin to billow their respiratory gills. This motion creates current that carries food particles through the burrow and allows the nymph to filter feed. Other <b>mayfly</b> nymphs possess elaborate filter feeding mechanisms like that of the genus Isonychia. The nymph have forelegs that contain long bristle-like structures that have two rows of hairs. Interlocking hairs form the filter by which the insect traps food particles. The action of filter feeding has a small impact on water purification but an even larger impact on the convergence of small particulate matter into matter of a more complex form that goes on to benefit consumers later in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|Another {{literary}} {{reference to}} mayflies {{is seen in}} The Epic of Gilgamesh, {{one of the earliest}} surviving great works of literature. The briefness of Gilgamesh's life is compared to that of the adult <b>mayfly.</b>|$|E
500|$|<b>Mayflies</b> are {{consumed}} in several cultures and {{are estimated to}} contain the most raw protein content of any edible insect by dry weight. In Malawi, kungu, a paste of <b>mayflies</b> (Caenis kungu) and mosquito is made into a cake for eating. Adult <b>mayflies</b> are collected and eaten {{in many parts of}} China and Japan. Near Lake Victoria, Povilla <b>mayflies</b> are collected, dried and preserved for use in food preparations.|$|R
5|$|In Szeged, Hungary, <b>mayflies</b> are {{celebrated in}} a {{monument}} near the Belv√°rosi bridge, {{the work of}} local sculptor Pal Farkas, depicting the courtship dance of <b>mayflies.</b>|$|R
500|$|In pre-1950s France, [...] "chute de manne" [...] was {{obtained}} by pressing <b>mayflies</b> into cakes and using them as bird food and fishbait. From an economic standpoint, <b>mayflies</b> also provide fisheries with an excellent diet for fish. <b>Mayflies</b> could find uses in the biomedical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Their exoskeleton contains chitin, which has applications in these industries.|$|R
5|$|<b>Mayfly</b> larvae do {{not survive}} in {{polluted}} aquatic habitats and, thus, {{have been chosen}} as bioindicators, markers of water quality in ecological assessments.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mayfly</b> {{phylogeny}} {{was further}} studied using morphological and molecular analyses by Ogden {{and others in}} 2009. They found that the Asian genus Siphluriscus was sister to all other mayflies. Some existing lineages such as Ephemeroidea, and families such as Ameletopsidae, were found not to be monophyletic, through convergence among nymphal features.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{red list}} of {{threatened}} species includes one mayfly: Tasmanophlebi lacuscoerulei, the large blue lake <b>mayfly,</b> {{which is a}} native of Australia and is listed as endangered because its alpine habitat is vulnerable to climate change.|$|E
50|$|The Heptageniidae (synonym: Ecdyonuridae) are {{a family}} of <b>mayflies</b> with over 500 {{described}} species mainly distributed in the Holarctic, Oriental, and Afrotropical regions, and also present in the Central American Tropics and extreme northern South America. These are generally rather small <b>mayflies</b> with three long tails. The wings are usually clear with prominent venation although species with variegated wings are known. As in most <b>mayflies,</b> the males have large compound eyes, but not divided into upper and lower parts (the group is {{sometimes referred to as}} flat-headed <b>mayflies).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Baetidae is {{a family}} of <b>mayflies</b> with about 900 {{described}} species distributed worldwide. These are among the smallest of <b>mayflies,</b> adults rarely exceeding 10 mm in length excluding the two long slender tails and sometimes much smaller, {{and members of the}} family are often referred to as small <b>mayflies</b> or small minnow <b>mayflies.</b> Most species have long oval forewings with very few cross veins (see Comstock-Needham system) but the hindwings are usually very small or even absent. The males often have very large eyes, shaped like turrets above the head (this is known as [...] "turbinate condition").|$|R
5000|$|Palingeniidae is {{a family}} of <b>mayflies,</b> members of which are known as spiny-headed {{burrowing}} <b>mayflies.</b> These are generally quite large <b>mayflies</b> with more than four longitudinal cross-veins on their wings. Males have short, wide pronotums and the legs are well-developed in both sexes. The cerci (tails) on females are shorter than the body. The nymphs live burrowed in the mud {{at the bottom of}} large streams and rivers.|$|R
5|$|Caddisfly {{cases are}} open at both ends, the larvae drawing oxygenated water through the {{posterior}} end, over their gills, and pumping {{it out of}} the wider, anterior end. The larvae move around inside the tubes and this helps maintain the water current; the lower the oxygen content of the water, the more active the larvae need to be. This mechanism enable caddisfly larvae to live in waters too low in oxygen content to support stonefly and <b>mayfly</b> larvae.|$|E
5|$|The oldest <b>mayfly</b> {{inclusion}} in amber is Cretoneta zherichini (Leptophlebiidae) from the Lower Cretaceous of Siberia. In the much younger Baltic amber numerous inclusions of several modern families of mayflies {{have been found}} (Ephemeridae, Potamanthidae, Leptophlebiidae, Ametropodidae, Siphlonuridae, Isonychiidae, Heptageniidae, and Ephemerellidae). The modern genus Neoephemera is represented in the fossil record by the Ypresian species N.antiqua from Washington State.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mayfly</b> nymphs {{may serve}} as hosts for parasites such as {{nematodes}} and trematodes. Some of these affect the nymphs' behaviour {{in such a way}} that they become more likely to be predated. Other nematodes turn adult male mayflies into quasi-females which haunt the edges of streams, enabling the parasites to break their way out into the aqueous environment they need to complete their life cycles. The nymphs can also serve as intermediate hosts for the horsehair worm Paragordius varius, which causes its definitive host, a grasshopper, to jump into water and drown.|$|E
50|$|Ephemeridae is {{a family}} of <b>mayflies</b> with about 150 {{described}} species found throughout the world except Australia and Oceania. These are generally quite large <b>mayflies</b> (up to 35 mm) with either two or three very long tails. Many species have distinctively patterned wings.|$|R
50|$|Ephemerelloidea is a {{superfamily}} of <b>mayflies</b> in the suborder Pannota. It is a basal {{group of}} <b>mayflies</b> with a worldwide distribution. Members of this super-family {{can be distinguished}} from those of Caenoidea {{by the fact that}} the gills of the nymphs are not filamentous.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{some very}} {{primitive}} character states, the Coxoplectoptera rather looked like early Paleozoic ancestors of <b>mayflies,</b> e.g. in the wing venation of the adult stage they still had the elongate costal brace that is not fused to the costal margin, and in the larval stage they still had articulated lateral wing pads. The large and broad hind wings are a further plesiomorphy compared to the small hind wing of modern <b>mayflies,</b> and even compared to the slender hind wing of Permian stem group <b>mayflies</b> like Protereisma.|$|R
5|$|The nymph is the {{dominant}} life history stage of the <b>mayfly.</b> Different insect species vary in their tolerance to water pollution, but in general, the larval stages of mayflies, stoneflies (Plecoptera) and caddis flies (Trichoptera) are susceptible {{to a number of}} pollutants including sewage, pesticides and industrial effluent. In general, mayflies are particularly sensitive to acidification, but tolerances vary, and certain species are exceptionally tolerant to heavy metal contamination and to low pH levels. Ephemerellidae are among the most tolerant groups and Siphlonuridae and Caenidae the least. The adverse effects on the insects of pollution may be either lethal or sub-lethal, in the latter case resulting in altered enzyme function, poor growth, changed behaviour or lack of reproductive success. As important parts of the food chain, pollution can cause knock-on effects to other organisms; a dearth of herbivorous nymphs can cause overgrowth of algae, and a scarcity of predacious nymphs can result in an over-abundance of their prey species. Fish that feed on <b>mayfly</b> nymphs that have bioaccumulated heavy metals are themselves at risk. Adult female mayflies find water by detecting the polarization of reflected light. They are easily fooled by other polished surfaces which can act as traps for swarming mayflies.|$|E
5|$|From the Permian, {{numerous}} stem group {{representatives of}} mayflies are known, {{which are often}} lumped into a separate taxon Permoplectoptera (e.g. including Protereisma permianum in the Protereismatidae, and Misthodotidae). The larvae of Permoplectoptera still had 9 pairs of abdominal gills, and the adults still had long hindwings. Maybe the fossil family Cretereismatidae from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil also belongs as the last offshoot to Permoplectoptera. The Crato outcrops otherwise yielded fossil specimens of modern <b>mayfly</b> families or the extinct (but modern) family Hexagenitidae. However, from the same locality the strange larvae and adults of the extinct family Mickoleitiidae (order Coxoplectoptera) have been described, which represents the fossil sister group of modern mayflies, {{even though they had}} very peculiar adaptations such as raptorial forelegs.|$|E
5|$|In most species, the nymphs are herbivores or detritivores, {{feeding on}} algae, diatoms or detritus, {{but in a}} few species, they are predators of chironomid and other small insect larvae and nymphs. Nymphs of Povilla burrow into {{submerged}} wood and {{can be a problem}} for boat owners in Asia. Some are able to shift from one feeding group to another as they grow, thus enabling them to utilise a variety of food resources. They process a great quantity of organic matter as nymphs and transfer a lot of phosphates and nitrates to terrestrial environments when they emerge from the water, thus helping to remove pollutants from aqueous systems. Along with caddisfly larvae and gastropod molluscs, the grazing of <b>mayfly</b> nymphs has {{a significant impact on the}} primary producers, the plants and algae, on the bed of streams and rivers.|$|E
40|$|Burrowing <b>mayflies</b> (Hexagenia bilineata) were {{collected}} in 1991 {{in the vicinity of}} the DePere dam on the Fox River, Brown County, Wisconsin. Because Hexagenia <b>mayflies</b> are indicators of good water quality, their emergence from the Fox River is evidence of improvement in conditions at the sediment-water interface...|$|R
50|$|Potamanthus is a genus of <b>mayflies</b> with 13 species.|$|R
50|$|Barbaetis is a genus of <b>mayflies</b> in {{the family}} Baetidae.|$|R
5|$|Nymphs live {{primarily}} in streams under rocks, in decaying vegetation, or in sediments. Few species live in lakes, {{but they are}} among the most prolific. For example, the emergence of one species of Hexagenia was recorded on Doppler weather radar by the shoreline of Lake Erie in 2003. In the nymphs of most <b>mayfly</b> species, the paddle-like gills do not function as respiratory surfaces because sufficient oxygen is absorbed through the integument, instead serving to create a respiratory current. However, in low-oxygen environments such as the mud at the bottom of ponds in which Ephemera vulgata burrows, the filamentous gills act as true accessory respiratory organs and are used in gaseous exchange.|$|E
5|$|The nymphs are {{eaten by}} {{a wide range of}} predators and form an {{important}} part of the aquatic food chain. Fish are among the main predators, picking nymphs off the bottom or ingesting them in the water column, and feeding on emerging nymphs and adults on the water surface. Carnivorous stonefly, caddisfly, alderfly and dragonfly larvae feed on bottom-dwelling <b>mayfly</b> nymphs, as do aquatic beetles, leeches, crayfish and amphibians. Besides the direct mortality caused by these predators, the behaviour of their potential prey is also affected, with the nymphs' growth rate being slowed by the need to hide rather than feed. The nymphs are highly susceptible to pollution and can be useful in the biomonitoring of water bodies. Once they have emerged, large numbers are preyed on by birds, bats and by other insects.|$|E
5|$|Various {{insects and}} arachnids reside around the Petitcodiac River. Among them is the stonefly, the <b>mayfly,</b> the caddisfly, the simulium, the {{subfamily}} of tanypodinae, and the Hydracarina. Non-native species, such as the black-footed spider, the beech scale, the white-marked tussock moth, and the mountain ash sawfly have also made their home in the Petitcodiac River watershed. At the southern extremities of the watershed, 50 to 90percent of the world's semipalmated sandpipers feed on the mud shrimp at Shepody Bay. Around 269,445 stop there before migrating to South America, a number which accounts for at least 7.7percent of the total population. Among others, the semipalmated plover (around 2percent of the North American population), the short-billed dowitcher, the red knot, the sanderling, and the least sandpiper are also known for migrating through the Important Bird Area.|$|E

5|$|Often, all the mayflies in a {{population}} mature at once (a hatch), and {{for a day or}} two in the spring or autumn, mayflies are everywhere, dancing around each other in large groups, or resting on every available surface. In many species the emergence is synchronised with dawn or dusk, and light intensity seems to be an important cue for emergence, but other factors may also be involved. Baetis intercalaris, for example, usually emerges just after sunset in July and August, but in one year, a large hatch was observed at midday in June. The soft-bodied subimagos are very attractive to predators. Synchronous emergence is probably an adaptive strategy that reduces the individual's risk of being eaten. The lifespan of an adult <b>mayfly</b> is very short, varying with the species. The primary function of the adult is reproduction; adults do not feed, and have only vestigial (unusable) mouthparts, while their digestive systems are filled with air. Dolania americana has the shortest lifespan of any mayfly: the adult females of the species live for less than five minutes.|$|E
5|$|Paranota plus leg gene {{recruitment}} hypothesis: The fossil larvae of Coxoplectoptera provided {{important new}} {{clues to the}} disputed question of the evolutionary origin of insect wings. Before the larvae fossil discovery the paranotal-hypothesis and the leg-exite-hypothesis have been considered as incompatible alternative explanations, which have both been supported {{by a set of}} evidences from the fossil record, comparative morphology, developmental biology and genetics. The expression of leg genes in the ontogeny of the insect wing has been universally considered as conclusive evidence in favour of the leg-exite-hypothesis, which proposes that insect wings are derived from mobile leg appendages (exites). However, the larvae of Coxoplectoptera show that the abdominal gills of mayflies and their ancestors, which are generally considered as corresponding structures to insect wings, articulated within the dorsal tergite plates. This cannot be seen in modern <b>mayfly</b> larvae, because their abdominal tergites and sternites are fused to rings, without any traces left even in embryonic development. If larval gills and wings are corresponding ("serial homologous") structures and thus share the same evolutionary origin, the new results from Coxoplectoptera demonstrate that also wings are of tergal origin, as proposed by the classical paranotal-hypothesis. Staniczek, Bechly & Godunko (2011) therefore suggested a new hypothesis that could reconcile the apparently conflicting evidence from paleontology and developmental genetics: wings first originated as stiff outgrowths of tergal plates (paranota), and only later in evolution became mobile, articulated appendages through secondary recruiting of leg genes.|$|E
