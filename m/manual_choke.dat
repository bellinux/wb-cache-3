40|$|The {{threat of}} {{slugging}} to production facilities {{has been known}} since the 1970 s. This undesirable flow phenomenon continues {{to attract the attention}} of researchers and operators alike. The most common method for slug mitigation is by choking the valve at the exit of the riser which unfortunately could negatively affect production. The focus, therefore, is to satisfy the need for system stability and to maximize production simultaneously. Active feedback control is a promising way to achieve this. However, due to the complexity of multiphase flow systems, it is a challenge to develop a robust slug control system to achieve the desired performance using existing design tools. In this paper, a new general method for multiphase flow system stability analysis was proposed. Active feedback control was observed to optimize slug attenuation compared with <b>manual</b> <b>choking.</b> The use of soft sensors was believed to be desirable for the practical implementation of the proposed control technique...|$|R

40|$|Multiphase flow is {{associated}} with concurrent flow {{of more than one}} phase (gas-liquid, liquid-solid, or gas-liquid-solid) in a conduit. The simultaneous flow of these phases in a flow line, may initiate a slug flow in the pipeline. Hydrodynamic slug flow is an alternate or irregular flow with surges of liquid slug and gas pocket. This occurs when the velocity difference between the gas flow rate and liquid flow rate is high enough resulting in an unstable hydrodynamic behaviour usually caused by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Active feedback control technology, though found effective for the control of severe slugs, has not been studied for hydrodynamic slug mitigation in the literature. This work extends active feedback control application for mitigating hydrodynamic slug problem to enhance oil production and recovery. Active feedback Proportional-Integral (PI) control strategy based on measurement of pressure at the riser base as controlled variable with topside choking as manipulated variable was investigated through Olga simulation in this project. A control system that uses the topside choke valve to keep the pressure at the riser base at or below the average pressure in the riser slug cycle has been implemented. This has been found to prevent liquid accumulation or blockage of the flow line. OLGA (olga is a commercial software widely tested and used in oil and gas industries) has been used to assess the capability of active feedback control strategy for hydrodynamic slug control and has been found to give useful results and most interestingly the increase in oil production and recovery. The riser slugging was suppressed and the choke valve opening was improved from 5 % to 12. 65 % using riser base pressure as controlled variable and topside choke valve as the manipulated variable for the <b>manual</b> <b>choking</b> when compared to the automatic choking in a stabilised operation, representing an improvement of 7. 65 % in the valve opening. Secondly, implementing active control at open-loop condition reduced the riser base pressure from 15. 3881 bara to 13. 4016 bara...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this master thesis is to design, implement, and evaluate sliding mode control (SMC) applied to stabilize slugging using only the downhole pressure as measurement. The {{pros and cons of}} the resulting output-feedback sliding mode controller are to be evaluated against the conventional PI controller. The thesis is based on, and a continuation of the work and conclusions of my project thesis, where the conclusion was that the SMC might have a significant potential for increased oil production and recovery. The clear limitation was however the uncertainty regarding the validity of the van Der Pol model used, {{and the fact that the}} SMC was provided the real time-derivative states. Therefore the original main tasks of this thesis was to implement a high fidelity simulation model of severe riser slugging, and to design (and test) differentiators with the purpose of evaluating the output-feedback performance of the SMC. As it turn out that I was not able to achieve the task of stabilizing the pressure with SMC on the chosen OLGA model, the focus of this thesis has in agreement with my supervisors been changed quite a lot from the task requested in the project description. Possible reasons for the lack of results, and the chosen focus of the thesis is presented in the introduction chapter. The thereby chosen focus became the task of designing testing differentiators for the SMC, but with testing on the van Der Pol model. Before presenting and arguing for this change of focus in the section about task and limitation, the introduction chapter starts by giving a brief overview of the environment or setting the controlling challenge is a part of, and follows up by presenting the work and conclusion of that project thesis. In the end of the chapter, the structure of the thesis is shortly listed. The introduction is followed up by giving a further insight to the slug problematic. An overview of the historical development, and a description of some research within the field are provided. The last part of the chapter gives a quite thorough description on the riser slugging phenomenon. Thereby the sliding mode controller (SMC) is presented in chapter 3. The challenge concerning chattering is also discussed, and the approach of using boundary layer to suppress the chattering is introduced. In chapter 4, the empirical van der Pol based model is derived, and the model is augmented to use the valve rate as control input. Chapter 6 gives a discussion on why the SMC should be performed on the choke rate and not directly on the choke opening. This section also designs the SMC that will be used for testing, and the needed time-derivatives for testing the SMC are derived. The chosen main focus of this thesis is to evaluate if there is possible to design observers (differentiators) that meets the requirements for the designed SMC to stabilize slugging. The tests are performed on the van Der Pol model. This task is introduced through chapter 7, that present general observer theory, theory about using observers combined with SMC, and finally the two observers chosen for further testing; the high gain observer (HGO) and the robust high-order sliding mode differentiator (RHOSMD). The first stage in evaluating the HGO and RHOSMD is open loop testing, and is described in chapter 8. The observers perform well for the ideal case of no disturbance, but in the presence of measurement noise the conclusion is that estimations of the higher order time-derivatives do likely not meet the very demanding requirements of the SMC. The biggest problem is probably the time-delay of the estimation, but the correctness of the amplitude might also be a problem. In chapter 9 the observers was tested further in a SMC controlled closed loop system to get a more precise indication on how well the observers are fitted for their intended task of providing the SMC with the required estimations. As for the open loop tests, the 'isolated' estimation performance of the required states was considered, but the main focus was the performance of the output-feedback SMC compared to the performance of <b>manual</b> <b>choking,</b> the PI controller, and the performance of the state-feedback SMC. This chapter confirmed the assumption from the open loop testing that in presence of measurement noise, the observers is not able to meet the demanding requirements of the designed SMC. For the theoretical ideal case of no disturbance the results is very good, especially for the HGO. In the case of measurement noise, the RHOSMD perform slightly better. In both chapter 8 and 9, tuning is considered and discussed. However, since the conclusions of the observer testing is negative, the SMC is not tested further. The results will be negative for output-feedback testing, and a quite extensive state-feedback testing of the SMC is performed in the project thesis. The main results and conclusions throughout the thesis, are presented in chapter 10. The chapter also contain a short discussion where it is concluded that the alternative designs, SMC with direct choke rate control and SMC of the choke acceleration, will not be a solution on the state-feedback SMC problems described in this thesis. There is also a short discussion regarding CPU and system requirements for the observers and the controller. At the very end, further work is discussed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Slugging {{is one of}} the {{challenges}} usually encountered in multiphase transportation of oil and gas. It is an intermittent flow of liquid and gas which manifests in pressure and flow fluctuations capable of causing upset in topside process facilities. It can also induce structural defects in pipeline-riser system. The threat of slugging to oil and gas facilities has been known since the early 1970 s. This study investigated a new method for slug flow stability analysis and proposed the use of active feedback control and intermittent absorber (a passive device) for hydrodynamic and severe slugging attenuation. The geometry impact on the hydrodynamic slug flow in pipeline-riser systems was established using modelling (LedaFlow and OLGA) and experimental studies. The unit cell model in both software packages, the slug tracking model of OLGA and slug capturing model of LedaFlow were employed for hydrodynamic slug modelling. Three distinct slug regions were reported for a typical pipeline-riser system. The H-region typifies the slug flow regime in the pipeline-riser system due to slug formed in the horizontal pipeline upstream the riser pipe. The V-region represents the slug flow regime due to the riser pipe while the I-region describes slug flow regime where both horizontal and vertical pipes contributes to the dynamics of the slug flow in pipeline-riser system. A simple but yet robust methodology {{that can be used for}} pipeline-riser system and slug controller design was proposed. The active feedback control was shown to help stabilise hydrodynamic slug flow at larger valve opening compared with <b>manual</b> valve <b>choking.</b> For the case study, a benefit of up to 5 % reduction in riserbase pressure was recorded for the proposed method. This in practical sense means increase in oil production. The analysis also showed that the new slug attenuation device (intermittent absorber) possesses the potential for slug attenuation. Experimental studies showed that the device was able to reduce the magnitude of riserbase pressure fluctuation due to hydrodynamic slugging up to 22 %. The absorber enables larger valve opening for both hydrodynamic and severe slugging stabilisation. For severe slugging attenuation for example, a benefit of 9 % reduction in riser base pressure was recorded for the case studied. This is of great benefit to the oil and gas industry since this translates to increased oil production. Slug attenuation index (SAI) and pressure benefit index (PBI), have been proposed to quantify the slug attenuation potential and the production benefits of the intermittent absorber respectively. The SAI and the PBI provided consistent results and methods for estimating the slug attenuation potential of the intermittent absorber concept. They could also be used to quantify the slug attenuation benefits of other slug mitigation techniques...|$|R

5000|$|Most rotaries had normal inlet valves, so {{that the}} fuel (and {{lubricating}} oil) was taken into the cylinders already mixed with air - as in a normal four-stroke engine.

The pilot needed to set the throttle to the desired setting (usually full open) and then adjust the fuel/air mixture to suit using a separate [...] "fine adjustment" [...] lever that controlled the air supply valve (in the manner of a <b>manual</b> <b>choke</b> control). Due to the rotary engine's large rotational inertia, it was possible to adjust the appropriate fuel/air mixture by trial and error without stalling it, although this varied between different types of engine, and in any case it required a good deal of practice to acquire the necessary knack.

50|$|The {{wide and}} large port heads with {{staggered}} valve placement give the Boss 302 high power capabilities. Because of the pent-roof {{design of the}} heads, the Boss also had forged pop-up pistons to achieve the desired 10.5:1 compression ratio. Early units were typically characterized by very large intake (2.23 inches) and exhaust (1.70 inches) valves sitting in a small quench style combustion chamber. Exhaust valves were sodium-filled to aid cooling. Valve springs were dual units with an inner and outer spring to minimize harmonic resonance at high RPM. The heads feature steel spring seats, screw-in rocker studs, pushrod guide plates to aid in pushrod stability at high RPMs, and adjustable rocker arms. Fuel was provided by a Holly 780cfm <b>manual</b> <b>choke</b> carburetor. The taller intake required a thinner spacer. Ford used a phenolic spacer that incorporated an aluminum tube for the PCV hose, and also helped isolate the carburetor from {{the heat of the}} intake. Ignition was handled by a dual point distributor firing then unique 14mm AF 32 Autolite sparkplugs specified because of their smaller size (5/8 inch wrench vs. 13/16 inch wrench) so as to fit within the tight confines of the combustion chamber alongside the very large valves.|$|E

The Hyper Pak consisted of a very-long-ram intake manifold meant to accept a Carter AFB 4-barrel carburetor, the AFB carburetor itself and an appropriate air cleaner, dual (front-3 and rear-3) cast-iron exhaust headers, a large-diameter exhaust Y-pipe to connect to these dual cast-iron headers, a larger muffler, a 276Â°-duration camshaft with appropriate valve springs and pushrods, a heavier-duty clutch, a <b>manual</b> <b>choke</b> control, a starter motor modification template and, in the full-race version of the package, high-compression pistons designed to increase the engine's compression ratio to 10.5 from the stock 8.5. The Hyper Pak was recommended for installation only on vehicles equipped with manual transmissions, for the camshaft was of such characteristics that a high idle speed was required to prevent engine stall-out. The Hyper Pak was primarily intended for competition driving, its road manners involving rough idling and poor cold-engine driveability, a high power band and poor fuel economy. But, in competition events, it proved unbeatable. Eight factory-backed Valiants entered the 1960 NASCAR compact car race at Daytona Beach, and humbled the competition; the Valiants came in first through eighth. After a similar performance the following year, the race was dropped. A high-fidelity reproduction of the Hyper Pak intake manifold was created by noted Slant-6 builder Doug Dutra in the late 1990s; subsequently the tooling was sold to a marketer of performance equipment for inline six-cylinder engines.|$|E
