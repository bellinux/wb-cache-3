However, the use of <b>mechanical</b> <b>weeding</b> in conventional agriculture is increasing, due to public demands to lower the use of pesticides and an increased number of pesticide-resistant weeds.

40|$|Because of {{environmental}} and health safety issues, {{it is necessary to}} develop strategies that do not rely on herbicides to manage weeds. Introducing temporary grassland into annual crop rotations and <b>mechanical</b> <b>weeding</b> are the two main features that are frequently used in integrated and organic cropping systems for this purpose. To evaluate the contribution of these two factors in interaction with other cropping system components and environmental conditions, the present study updated an existing biophysical model (i. e. AlomySys) that quantifies the effects of cropping system on weed dynamics. Based on previous experiments, new sub-models were built to describe the effects on plant survival and growth reduction of <b>mechanical</b> <b>weeding</b> resulting from weed seedling uprooting and covering by soil, and those of grassland mowing resulting from tiller destruction. Additional modifications described the effect of the multi-year crop canopy of grassland on weed survival, growth, development and seed return to the soil. The improved model was used to evaluate the weed dynamics over 27 years in the conventional herbicide-based cropping system most frequently observed in farm surveys (i. e. oilseed rape/winter wheat/winter barley rotation with superficial tillage) and then to test prospective non-chemical scenarios. Preliminary simulations tested a large range of <b>mechanical</b> <b>weeding</b> and mowing strategies, varying operation frequencies, dates and, in the case of <b>mechanical</b> <b>weeding,</b> characteristics (i. e. tool, working depth, tractor speed). For <b>mechanical</b> <b>weeding</b> soon after sowing, harrowing was better than hoeing for controlling weed seed production. The later the operation, the more efficient the hoeing and the less efficient the harrowing. Tractor speed had little influence. Increasing tilling depth increased plant mortality but increased weed seed production because of additional seed germination triggering by the weeding tool. Decreasing the interrow width for hoeing was nefarious for weed control. The best combinations were triple hoeing in oilseed rape and sextuple harrowing in cereals. The best mowing strategy was mowing thrice, every 4 – 6 weeks, starting in mid-May. The best individual options were combined, simulated over 27 years and compared to the herbicide-based reference system. If herbicide applications were replaced solely by <b>mechanical</b> <b>weeding,</b> blackgrass infestation could not be satisfactorily controlled. If a three-year lucerne was introduced into the rotation, weed infestations were divided by ten. Replacing chisel by mouldboard ploughing before winter wheat reduced weed infestations at short, medium and long term to a level comparable to the herbicide-based reference system...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} whether soil disturbance from <b>mechanical</b> <b>weeding</b> in organic systems affects nutrient release from organic matter in compost-amended soil was examined {{in a long-term}} organic-versus-conventional rotational cropping system experiment over three years. The experimental design included continuous snap beans, and a fully phased snap beans/fall rye crop rotation sequence. Treatments were combinations of yearly applied fertiliser (synthetic fertiliser, 1 × compost, 3 × compost) and weed control (herbicide, <b>mechanical</b> <b>weeding).</b> The 1 × compost rate was calculated to deliver the equivalent of 50 kg N ha- 1 : equal to the rate ofN in the synthetic fertiliser treatments. Ion exchange membranes were buried for 24 hours following <b>mechanical</b> <b>weeding</b> in bean plots. Adsorbed ions were then eluted and quantified. Available ammonium-nitrogen was not affected byweeding treatment, but nitrate-nitrogen was consistently less in mechanically weeded plots than in plots treated with herbicide. Principal component analysis of NH 4 -N, NO 3 -N, P, K, Ca and Mg availabilities showed distinct groupings of treatments according to fertility treatment rather than weeding treatment.

In the herbicide experiments two treatments were applied by PRE emergence herbicides (metribuzin, clomazone, dimethenamid and metribuzin, flufenacet, clomazone) and another two treatments were sprayed {{with a combination of}} PRE + POST emergence herbicides (metribuzin, flufenacet, thifensulfuron and pendimethalin, thifensulfuron, bentazone, cycloxydim). Furthermore, a POST herbicide treatment was implemented (thifensulfuron, bentazone, thifensulfuron and fluazifop-P-butyl). In the <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> control experiments, treatments were: three times hoeing, PRE emergence harrowing plus three times hoeing, hoeing and harrowing in rotation or three times harrowing.

40|$|In {{conventional}} {{seed production}} of grasses and clover it is recognised that a low plant density in the seed crop stimulates the reproductive development and hence increase seed yield. Most temperate forage species of grasses and white clover establish slowly {{and have a}} relatively poor ground cover, which limits the competition against weeds. In order to optimise quality and yield in organic grass and clover seed production alternative establishment methods have been identified. These methods enhance crop competitiveness against weeds and allow for <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> control. Establishing the under sown seed crop right between the cereal cover crop row provides a higher ground cover, and the establishment rate of the seed crop is enhanced. This method of establishment is recommended when weed density is low or where the prevailing weeds produce seeds that can {{be separated from the}} harvested grass or clover seed. Establishing the under sown seed crop in the cereal row allows for different strategies of <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> control and our results show that perennial ryegrass tolerates a range of strategies of <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> control including up to three harrowings.

Precise steering and depth control, improved seedbed friability and lighter tractors or controlled traffic could bring considerable improvements. To expose weed seeds to predators, position them for fatal germination, viability loss or low emergence may require completely different soil displacement patterns than those of current implements and systems. Controlled traffic and precise strip tillage offer good opportunities for implementing these weed management strategies in minimum-tillage systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{sugar beet}} (Beta vulgaris) weed control is {{commonly}} performed by herbicide application applied broadcast at splitting during the cultivation period. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>weeding</b> {{can be an}} alternative to chemical weed control. The aim of this experiment was the estimation of weed control efficacy {{with the use of}} automatic steering technologies by camera guidance, the use of different intra row weed control implements in conservation tillage systems and the influence of these techniques to the number of uprooted sugar beets. A field experiment with a randomized complete plot design was conducted in 2015 at Ihinger Hof, Germany. Weed density ranged from 0 to 12 plants m- 2 with Chenopodium album, Polygonum convolvulus, Polygonum aviculare as the most abundant weed species. Hoeing with the use of automatic steering technologies reduced the weed density by 82 %. The use of finger weeders, rotary-harrow and torsion finger weeder reduced the weed density by 29 % compared to common hoeing strategies. Differences in the number of uprooted sugar beets were not found across all treatments. We revealed the possibility of a more intense use of <b>mechanical</b> <b>weeding</b> technologies in combination with precision farming technologies in sugar beet...|$|E

40|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> control, {{chisel plow}} tillage and organic {{fertilization}} are important components of sustainable agriculture that {{can contribute to}} the preservation and improvement of soil and water resources. These practices can each affect weed communities, crop weed interactions and crop yields. Little is known about their combined effects on weed populations and weed community dynamics in common cropping systems. The main objective of this project was {{to determine the effects of}} crop rotation, weed control, tillage and nutrient source and their interactions on weed communities and weed emergence. The field experiment was conducted on a Sainte-Rosalie clay and a Duravin loam in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada, in 1996 and 1997. Mechanical control was not as effective as chemical control in controlling weed populations. Weed density increased after the second pass of the rotary hoe in soybean. Cultivation in corn triggered flushes of weed emergence, but corn yield was not affected by the increase in weed density. Chisel plow tillage reduced the efficacy of <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> control in both crops. Reduced soybean yields were partly attributed to the large quantities of corn residues under chisel plow tillage. Nutrient source had no effect on weed densities. However, environmental stress conditions experienced in spring 1997 resulted in reduced crop growth and increased weed biomass under organic fertilization. Seed production of dominant residual weed species was greater under mechanical compared with chemical weed control, but was unaffected by tillage and nutrient source. Particular attention to weed management will be required when including both chisel plow tillage and organic nutrient source in a corn-soybean rotation, especially when resorting to <b>mechanical</b> <b>weed</b> control only...|$|R
