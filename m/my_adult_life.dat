I doubt it. One of my oldest friends–he was born in 1847–was Sir James Agg-Gardner, a little man and a great lover of wine: he was M.P. for Cheltenham, and Chairman of the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons; {{he was one of}} a few friends who lunched with me at my old Mark Lane headquarters, in 1918, to celebrate my return to civilian life. There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; we had one of them and it really was magnificent! We were {{on the eve of a}} General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a working majority, and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E
500|$|In a {{study of}} a working-class lesbian {{community}} in Buffalo, New York, in the 1940s and 1950s, The Well of Loneliness was the only work of lesbian literature anyone had read or heard of. For many young lesbians in the 1950s, {{it was the only}} source of information about lesbianism. The Wells name recognition made it possible to find when bookstores and libraries did not yet have sections devoted to LGBT literature. As late as 1994, an article in Feminist Review noted that The Well [...] "regularly appears in coming-out stories– and not just those of older lesbians". It has often been mocked: Terry Castle says that [...] "like many bookish lesbians I seem to have spent much of <b>my</b> <b>adult</b> <b>life</b> making jokes about it", and Mary Renault, who read it in 1938, remembered laughing at its [...] "earnest humourlessness" [...] and [...] "impermissible allowance of self-pity". Yet it has also produced powerful emotional responses, both positive and negative. One woman was so angry at the thought of how The Well would affect an [...] "isolated emerging lesbian" [...] that she [...] "wrote a note in the library book, to tell other readers that women loving women can be beautiful". A Holocaust survivor said, [...] "Remembering that book, I wanted to live long enough to kiss another woman." ...|$|E

In the early '80s, I turned down an offer to revive my role as Gilbert in a dreadful Beaver reunion series.

And, instead of doing the artist/audience performance-type thing, I wanted to deconstruct it and make the audience more of a fly-on-the-wall kind of observer...

Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter called it [...] "chillingly effective", generally praising the effects and the film's [...] "claustrophobic intensity". He said that though the characters [...] "aren't particularly interesting or developed", there was [...] "something refreshing about a monster movie that isn't filled with the usual suspects". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly said that the film was [...] "surreptitiously subversive, a stylistically clever little gem", and that while the characters were [...] "vapid, twenty-something nincompoops" [...] and the acting [...] "appropriately unmemorable", the decision to tell the story through amateur footage was [...] "brilliant". Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that the film is [...] "pretty scary at times" [...] and cites [...] "unmistakable evocations of 9/11".
