5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he said {{at the start of the}} episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E
25|$|According to Ivinskaya, Zinaida Pasternak was infuriated by her husband's infidelity. Once, {{when his}} younger son Leonid fell seriously ill, Zinaida {{extracted}} a promise from her husband, {{as they stood}} by the boy's sickbed, that he would end his affair with Ivinskaya. Pasternak asked Luisa Popova, a mutual friend, to tell Ivinskaya about his promise. Popova {{told him that he}} <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> himself. Soon after, Ivinskaya happened to be ill at Popova's apartment, when suddenly Zinaida Pasternak arrived and confronted her.|$|E
25|$|In {{things that}} pertain to {{celestial}} glory {{there can be}} no forced operations. We must do according as the spirit of the Lord operates upon our understandings and feelings. We cannot be crowded into matters, however great might be the blessing attending such procedure. We cannot be forced into living a celestial law; we must do this ourselves, of our own free will. And whatever we do in regard to the principle of the United Order, we <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> because we desire to do it.|$|E

25|$|The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 now {{lays out}} in Section 6 what the fire service <b>must</b> <b>do.</b> <b>It</b> states that {{a fire and}} rescue {{authority}} must make provision {{for the purpose of}} promoting fire safety in its area and this must include the provision of information, publicity and encouragement in respect of the steps to be taken to prevent fires and death or injury by fire not only by the enforcement of specific fire safety legislation, but also by a proactive strategy targeted at all sections of the community.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Montreal Gazette, Laucke stated: [...] " [...] was the greatest natural talent I have ever come across." [...] At the time, Laucke was impressed by a piece called Entre dos aguas (Between Two Seas) that de Lucía was creating, which has become arguably his best-known composition. Since deLucía did not read music, Laucke offered to teach him but he refused. When the question arose as to whether Laucke would ever play deLucía's compositions in public, he advised Laucke, [...] "you <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in your own style".|$|E
500|$|Inside the {{underground}} {{part of the}} Orchid station, Ben puts every metal item he can find into a small compartment {{at the back of}} the room, while Locke watches the orientation video for the Orchid. On the tape, Pierre Chang (François Chau) begins to discuss time travel involving [...] "negatively charged exotic matter" [...] when the VCR malfunctions and the tape rewinds itself. Shortly, Keamy arrives and tells Locke that if he (Keamy) dies, the C4 on the freighter will detonate, due to a remote trigger linked to a heart rate monitor he is wearing. Regardless, Ben kills Keamy with no remorse or sympathy for those on the boat, in order to avenge his adopted daughter Alex (Tania Raymonde), whom Keamy executed. Ben seals and then activates power to the compartment he had loaded with metal items, blowing a hole in the back of it. Ben, now wearing a parka, tells Locke that whoever moves the island is forced to leave it and never come back; Ben <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> so that Locke can stay and lead the Others. Locke then goes to the Others, who welcome him home. Ben climbs through the hole and down a rocky tunnel beyond it into a frozen chamber, cutting his arm in the process. [...] He then turns a very large metal wheel. As he completes the rotation, an eerie sound and white-yellow light soon envelop the entire island. Ben disappears, only to reappear several months later in the Sahara Desert (as seen in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come").|$|E

2500|$|O'Keeffe {{then spent}} part of nearly every year working in New Mexico. She {{collected}} rocks and bones from the desert floor and made them and the distinctive architectural and landscape forms of the area subjects in her work. Known as a loner, O'Keeffe explored the land she loved often in her Ford Model A, which she purchased and learned to drive in 1929. She often talked about her fondness for Ghost Ranch and Northern New Mexico, as in 1943, when she explained: [...] "Such a beautiful, untouched lonely feeling place, such a fine part of what I call the 'Faraway'. It is a place I have painted before ... even now I <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Bunyan {{refused to}} agree to give up preaching, his period of {{imprisonment}} eventually extended to 12 years and brought great hardship to his family. Elizabeth, who made strenuous attempts to obtain his release, had been pregnant when her husband was arrested and she subsequently gave birth prematurely to a still-born child. Left to bring up four step-children, {{one of whom was}} blind, she had to rely on the charity of Bunyan's fellow members of the Bedford Meeting and other supporters and on what little her husband could earn in gaol by making shoelaces. But Bunyan remained resolute: [...] "O I saw in this condition I was a man who was pulling down his house upon the head of his Wife and Children; yet thought I, I <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> I must do it".|$|E
