40|$|Software Defined Radios (SDRs) are {{increasingly}} getting {{accepted in the}} military domain all over the world. With time, new nations are also continuously getting interested in the SDR technology and looking at various SDR programs and procurement models adopted by other nations till now. Focusing on the new entrants in the <b>SDR</b> <b>market,</b> the Wireless Innovation Forum (WInnF) has recently released a report, illustrating the different programs running in various nations in the SDR domain. It also presents the various players involved in different business models and the roles they play {{with the help of}} several use cases. However, the focus of the report is on the actual procurement process. Complementing the WInnF report, this paper aims to provide the new entrants in the <b>SDR</b> <b>market,</b> additional food for thought and to remind them about their future plans of possible waveform portability. It discusses tackling of some portability issues at the procurement level. The paper presents three possible business procurement models which new entrants can adopt depending on their individual requirements. In addition to that, the paper also lists a number of questions in a Questions Catalogue focusing on waveform portability which the procurement agencies could ask different players in the market before starting the procurement process. The list is not intended to be a complete list but aims to provide some of the important questions to be considered during the procurement process...|$|R
40|$|The SCA 2. 2. 2 {{architecture}} {{has achieved}} widespread adoption {{in the military}} communications market. Hundreds of thousands of SCA enabled software defined radios (SDRs) have been deployed to date, and world-wide dozens of programs are working to field more {{of these types of}} radios. The reasons for this success are the benefits enabled through adoption of the SCA: proven cost and delivery time advantages, lower logistical overhead through enhanced inter-component interoperability, simplified insertion of new communications capabilities in deployed radios, enhanced coalition interoperability through portability of waveforms and reduced development risk. As a result of this success, new countries and new organizations have begun to explore the use of the SCA, driving a second generation of <b>SDR</b> <b>market</b> adoption.

This is of particular interest, since the monetary conditionality in IMF-supported programs has traditionally been linked to central bank balance sheet items. Quantity targeting tends to be practiced today mostly in countries in which money markets are not yet well-developed or a monetary aggregate is used as the intermediate target. Most other central banks prefer to target a short-term interest rate, which results in day-to-day changes in balance sheet items becoming endogenous.

40|$|Abstract Ever {{evolving}} {{wireless communication}} standards, reduced time-to-market {{and a need}} for flexibility and interoperability of multiple wireless communication technologies on a single device are the driving factors behind implementation of wireless standards on Software Defined Radios (SDR) platforms. The concept behind SDR is to implement as much functionality on software as possible. SDR provide greater interoperability and programmability compared with traditional hardwired implementation {{at the cost of}} higher power consumption and <b>market</b> cost. <b>SDR</b> is the driving technology {{for the next generation of}} co-operative and cognitive radios. For implementing an SDR, the existing wireless communication algorithms needs to be modified and an appropriate hardware platform needs to be selected. The IEEE 802. 15. 4 LR-WPAN standard requires low cost and low-power consuming devices. The data rate requirements are also low (such as 250 kbps). Traditionally, the devices compliant with the standard are hardwired system-on-chip implementation which provides benefit in terms of power and cost. Recently, there has been significant effort on modeling the IEEE 802. 15. 4 SDR systems which provide greater interoperability and programmability of the devices. In this study, Transport Triggered Architecture (TTA) based Application Specific Processor is selected for SDR implementation of the IEEE 802. 15. 4 2. 4 GHz physical layer for studying the performance of such system in terms of Bit-Error-Rate, CPU cycle count, and processor chip area. As part of this work, different SDR frameworks like GNU Radio, Matlab-Simulink etc. were evaluated for their feasibility of providing an agile platform for the development. These existing frameworks need an operating system for their execution and are not suitable for stand-alone systems such as a TTA based processor. The work also includes the study of different receiver algorithms and design choices for the transceiver implementation. Based on existing literature and Matlab modeling, Asynchronous Zero-Crossing Detector (AZCD) based non-coherent receiver algorithm is selected for the implementation. The algorithm provides the required BER performance with very less complex computation and is suited for low power and low chip area implementations. The transmitter and receiver are implemented on single-core TTA processors which provide the required performance in terms of BER and data throughput. The processors designed need a very low silicon area and clock frequency for their realization...|$|R
40|$|Software Defined Radio is an {{industry}} term describing a method of utilizing a minimum amount of Radio Frequency (RF) /analog electronics before digitization takes place. Upon digitization all other functions are performed in software/firmware. There are as {{many different types of}} SDRs as there are data systems. Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology has been proven in the commercial sector since the early 90 's. Today's rapid advancement in mobile telephone reliability and power management capabilities exemplifies the effectiveness of the SDR technology for the modern communications market. In contrast the foundations of transponder technology presently qualified for satellite applications were developed during the early space program of the 1960 's. SDR technology offers potential to revolutionize satellite transponder technology by increasing science data through-put capability by at least an order of magnitude. While the SDR is adaptive in nature and is "One-size-fits-all" by design, conventional transponders are built to a specific platform and must be redesigned for every new bus. The SDR uses a minimum amount of analog/Radio Frequency components to up/down-convert the RF signal to/from a digital format. Once analog data is digitized, all processing is performed using hardware logic. Typical SDR processes include; filtering, modulation, up/down converting and demodulation. This presentation will show how the emerging <b>SDR</b> <b>market</b> has leveraged the existing commercial sector to provide a path to a radiation tolerant SDR transponder. These innovations will reduce the cost of transceivers, a decrease in power requirements and a commensurate reduction in volume. A second pay-off is the increased flexibility of the SDR by allowing the same hardware to implement multiple transponder types by altering hardware logic - no change of analog hardware is required - all of which can be ultimately accomplished in orbit. This in turn would provide high capability and low cost transponder to programs of all size...|$|R
40|$|SDR, {{since its}} {{theoretical}} definition by J. Mitola, {{has been really}} appealing for the military communications. The possibility to move forward from the legacy radio devices, where all the functionalities were directly embedded in the hardware, towards {{a new type of}} radio that allows reconfigurability and flexibility is seen as a Deus ex machina in the complex and crowded panorama of tactical communications. The possibility to execute different waveforms on the same platform can potentially prolong the lifecycle of an operational radio for several years. The possibility to port the same waveform to different hardware, on the other hand, has twofold implications: it allows the re-use of the same waveform, maximizing the return on investment for the developers and, in addition, it allows decoupling the radio manufacturer from the software developer, potentially creating a new market for the waveforms development and procurement. Similarly to what has been commonly experienced in the smartphone market, where Apps are developed independently by the vendor of the terminal, in the future, SDR waveforms might be developed by different subjects, even outside Industry (e. g. universities and research centers) and then ported on an existing SDR platform. The “SDR revolution” is anyway not feasible as long as common development rules for waveforms and common interfaces between the waveform and the underlying hardwarewill be clearly defined. The most relevant contribution in this sense was the definition of the Software Communication Architecture (SCA), published and maintained by the Joint Tactical Networking Centre (JTNC). The SCA defined a set of requirements and rules both for the development of waveforms and for the software definition of processing elements and functions within the host platforms, though leaving to implementers the possibility to choose between different hardware and software solution for the implementation of a SCA-compliant SDR solution. SCA, rapidly became a de facto standard in the military panorama, as it has been widely adopted for the major military SDR programmes also in Europe, mainly in its version 2. 2. 2. SCA 2. 2. 2 was designed to meet the stringent requirement of military communications, in terms of security,timing accuracy, real time behavior and it was not able to spread widely outside this context for several years, mainly because of the overhead it imposes to the applications. Today SCA, in its version 4. 1, has been published in the US as an emerging standard and its evolution is also supported by the Wireless Innovation Forum. One of the goal of the SCA 4. 1 is to define profiles that allows its implementation in devices with limited processing resources, meeting the needs of small form factor devices in the military context and projecting towards applications outside the military. Nevertheless, some other emerging standards are facing the military <b>SDR</b> <b>market,</b> as possible alternatives to SCA. From {{the point of view of}} a procurement agency (like MoDs are in the context of military communications),SDR offers significant benefits but, at the same time, it raises new issues and challenges. First, the transition to the software implementation of some functions of the radio platform, requires the development of new testing skills inside the Defence panorama. Each service (i. e. Armed Force) in the Italian Defence, developed during the years, its verification and validation (V&V) facilities, holding a proven experience in the testing methodologies for military radios. The transition to SDR requires that radio testing skills are enhanced with software verification and signal processing skills, as many of the function of new radios are not only performed in software but they also offer the possibility to perform inspection on their behavior. The military procurement strategy for SDR is today closely linked to SCA-based architectures. For these architectures new waveforms have been developed. The ability to test these waveforms,prior to their porting on the final hosting platforms, requires the verification of the compliance of the software modules to the rules of the underlying software architecture (SCA-based). This means that the verification strategy shall comprise the ability to verify that the SCA implementation of a software component is properly performed, assuring future compatibility of the component with the other elements of the waveform and of the platform. After the aforementioned V&V steps, carried out usually during the development of the SDR system or of one of its component (platform, waveform), the complete system is usually delivered to the test facility to undergo a number of tests analogous to that performed on the legacy systems: they span from testing the behavior of the radio over the air, to environmental and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing, to interoperability testing with existing communication systems, where applicable. These activities are usually performed through “live fire exercise”, how they are called in military jargon: the system is deployed into an environment that tries to recreate as much as possible the operational scenario and tested under realistic conditions, by the operators that will employ it in real operations soon afterwards. In response to these needs, the Italian MoD has identified the development of a governmental capability for SDR V&V as a strategic pillar and has consequently funded the establishment of a dedicated laboratory (called LANCERS), based on a cooperation between CSSN ITE, a research and experimentation center of the Italian Navy located in Livorno and CNIT (Consorzio Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni) where experimentation and research on tools and technicques for SDR V&V are performed. The laboratory has developed with the time also some collaboration with industries involved in the <b>SDR</b> <b>market.</b> This work summarizes the outcomes of the activities carried out in the LANCERS laboratory, regarding methodologies, tools and experimentation oriented to V&V of military SDR. After providing a brief overview of the major programmes and stakeholders of the military SDR panorama in chapter 1, an analysis of the domains of application of the T&E strategies for SDR will be identified in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 will provide an in depth description of the tools and procedures developed at LANCERS lab for military SDR test and evaluation. Different tools, addressing the needs of different phases of SDR development, will be presented, together with the design process that brought to their creation and some results of real applications of these tools. Chapter 4 will present a field testing campaign performed as a necessary complement to the lab test activities listed in chapter 3. Chapter 5 will draw the conclusions and present future work plans for further improving the tools and procedures presented. For some testing activities the presentation of the results will be limited, due to the fact that the disclosure of information related to some particular SDR product is at the moment of writing this thesis yet subject to restrictions. Provided results will be anyway sufficient to provide the reader with a good understanding of the functionalities and applicability of the presented tools and procedures...|$|R
