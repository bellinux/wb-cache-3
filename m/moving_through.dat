5|$|During this season, {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone formed on March 16, {{and the last}} one dissipated on December 12. A total of 29 tropical depressions formed this year in the Western Pacific, of which 25 became tropical storms. 19 storms reached typhoon intensity, of which 2 reached super typhoon strength. Two-thirds of the tropical cyclones formed between July and October. Typhoon Pamela was the longest-lived tropical cyclone of the season. Sixteen of the cyclones struck land during their life cycles, with eight <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> the Philippines. Tropical cyclones accounted for 35percent of the 1982 rainfall across Hong Kong, their fifth wettest tropical cyclone contribution on record at the time. Nearly half of the deaths during the season were the result of Typhoon Nancy <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> the Philippines and Vietnam in October.|$|E

5|$|When Gonzalo first formed, various governments {{across the}} eastern Caribbean issued {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches, extending from Guadeloupe {{to the coast}} of Puerto Rico. As the storm was strengthening and <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> the region, a hurricane warning was issued for the British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, and Saint Martin. Several major cruise lines altered their itineraries to avoid the storm.|$|E
5|$|A strong upper-level trough <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> {{the southeastern}} United States forced Danny northeastward, which also {{triggered}} {{the formation of}} another low pressure system near the coast of North Carolina early on August 29. Although this low formed within Danny's cyclonic envelope, satellite imagery indicated {{that it did not}} have the characteristics of a tropical cyclone. Therefore, it is not considered to be a continuation of Danny. The new low caused the tropical storm to degenerate into a trough about 275mi (445km) southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, and Danny's remnants were absorbed into a developing frontal zone shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|After {{continuing}} through the southeast United States, the storm became extratropical {{near the border}} of North Carolina and Virginia midday on September18. Although it initially maintained tropical storm-force winds, the former hurricane weakened below gale-force on September19 while it was near Philadelphia. The storm continued rapidly to the northeast, <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> New England and {{along the coast of}} Maine before turning more to the east. Late on September19, the storm moved across Nova Scotia, passing southeast of Newfoundland the next day. It was last observed late on September20 dissipating to the east of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|After the October counterattack {{was turned}} back, the Australians sought {{to regain the}} initiative. Evans was {{replaced}} by Brigadier Selwyn Porter and Wootten decided to establish a position in depth behind the Japanese forward line, deciding to once again establish a force at Pabu. On 19/20 November, three companies from the 2/32nd Infantry Battalion, {{under the command of}} Major Bill Mollard, occupied the position, and began to attack the Japanese resupply parties that were <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> the area, inflicting heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|Ashina She'er's {{soldiers}} were organized in five columns. The Tang army bypassed Karasahr and struck at Kucha {{from the north}} by <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> the Dzungarian Basin, which was {{the territory of the}} Chuyue (possibly Chigil) and Chumi, two Turkic tribes allied with the oasis state. The Tang army defeated the Chuyue and Chumi before entering the Tarim Basin, upon which the king of Karasahr fled his capital city and tried to find a defensible position in Kucha's eastern territories. Ashina She'er's forces pursued the Karasahr king, took him captive, and then executed him.|$|E

5|$|By June29, a trough, <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> the westerlies, rapidly {{approached}} the storm, causing the newly designated Amy to turn sharply toward the east. Strong wind shear disorganized the system slightly, leading to Amy featuring subtropical characteristics. By the evening, the strongest winds were not located around the center, but were instead situated between 60 and 90mi (95 and 140km) {{from the center}}. Convection became displaced {{from the center of}} circulation but the storm continued to intensify. Over the following several days, Amy tracked generally northeastward but underwent eastward jogs in response to rapidly moving troughs to the north.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War, {{during which}} Texas seceded from the United States, the area served a limited {{role in the}} {{conflict}} as new fortifications like Fort Chambers, near Anahuac, were constructed to ward off a mainland invasion by Union forces and to protect supply routes to and from Galveston.

5|$|East of the NK and ROK 8th Divisions, the NK 12th Division {{crossed the}} Naktong River at Andong, <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> the {{mountains}} in small groups to reach P'ohang-dong. The division was far under strength {{and at least one}} of its artillery batteries had to send its guns back north because it had no ammunition for them. UN planners had not anticipated that the 12th Division {{would be able to do}} this effectively, and thus was unprepared when its forces infiltrated the region so heavily.|$|E

5|$|In 1794 a state road, Genesee Road, {{was built}} from Utica {{west to the}} Genesee River. That year a {{contract}} was awarded to the Mohawk Turnpike and Bridge Company to extend the road northeast to Albany, and in 1798 it was extended. The Seneca Turnpike was key to Utica's development, replacing a worn footpath with a paved road. The village became a rest and supply area along the Mohawk River for goods and the many people <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> Western New York {{to and from the}} Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|In 1961 U.S. {{intelligence}} analysts estimated that 5,843 enemy infiltrators (actually 4,000) had moved {{south on the}} trail; in 1962, 12,675 (actually 5,300); in 1963, 7,693 (actually 4,700); and in 1964, 12,424. The supply capacity of the trail reached 20 to 30 tonnes per day in 1964 and it was estimated by the U.S. that 12,000 (actually 9,000) North Vietnamese regulars had reached South Vietnam that year. By 1965 the U.S. command in Saigon estimated that communist supply requirements for their southern forces amounted to 234 tons of all supplies per day and that 195 tons were <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> Laos.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the division's headquarters, {{along with}} the 1st Brigade, {{returned}} to Afghanistan. During that time, they operated in the frontier {{regions of the country}} such as Paktika Province, going places previously untouched by the war in search of Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces. Fighting in several small-scale conflicts such as Operation Avalanche, Operation Mountain Resolve, and Operation Mountain Viper, the division maintained a strategy of small units <b>moving</b> <b>through</b> remote regions of the country to interact directly with the population and drive out insurgents. The 1st Brigade also undertook a number of humanitarian missions.|$|E
