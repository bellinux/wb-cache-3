Against such a sanguine assessment, I argue that the significance of the CMI, even after its <b>multilateralization,</b> is largely limited to symbolism and its practical implications are inconsequential.

The analysis shows that such embargoes had notable effects on arms import patterns in about 30 percent of all cases. However, effects on targeted policies are much more limited. The link between arms embargoes and targeted policy change grows stronger over the lifetime of arms embargoes. The paper also uses a third measure of arms embargo success, initiator satisfaction. Arms embargoes are comparatively cheap for senders, and thus even only partially enforced embargoes may be seen as a success by the initiators of such a sanction. The analysis confirms the hypothesis that multilateral arms embargoes are more successful than unilateral ones. <b>Multilateralization</b> increases supplier satisfaction with an embargo, it raises the likelihood that there are significant changes in arms import patterns and even increases the possibility that there is policy change in the target. Related to <b>multilateralization</b> is arms embargo implementation. A higher degree of participation of countries and a stronger effort at implementation by participants increase the effectiveness. Arms embargoes are more effective when they are embedded in consistent policy packages. Arms embargoes in and of themselves will rarely affect target policies. ...|$|E

40|$|Mega-regional trade {{agreements}} (MRTAs) {{have appeared in}} response to the prolonged stagnation of the multilateral trading system ruled by the World Trade Organization (WTO). Although this issue has stimulated research in international integration, the specifics of MRTAs have not yet been sufficiently investigated. This article therefore assesses the <b>multilateralization</b> potential of regional commitments using the example of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). It includes commitments in market access liberalization made in regional {{trade agreements}} (RTAs) and in intraregional agricultural trade liberalization under the TPP. The central research problem is to identify the regional liberalization commitments that might be promoted {{to the level of the}} WTO. The authors use the methodology devised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development for assessing the potential <b>multilateralization.</b> RTA and MRTA commitments are grouped in two policy areas: WTO-plus (going beyond the normal provisions of the WTO) and WTO-beyond (dealing with issues going beyond the WTO). The TTP is scrutinized in the context of intraregional agricultural trade liberalization. MRTAs can raise regional commitments to the global level because of their large membership, regulatory transparency and high levels of implementation. The <b>multilateralization</b> of regional agreements is expected in services and investments as well as in various aspects of technical regulation. The key features of implementing RTA’s WTO-plus and WTO-beyond commitments in intraregional agricultural trade are discussed. Most RTAs have liberalized tariffs beyond the WTO Agreement on Agriculture (WTO-plus), but only a few have strengthened disciplines in non-tariff barriers and implemented WTO-beyond commitments for export restrictions and export subsidies. The TPP parties are a diverse group in terms of involvement in global agricultural trade and applied tariffs on agriculture and food. The TPP provides the record in eliminating tariffs for agricultural products while keeping a number of exceptions for sensitive products and long implementation periods. Agricultural market liberalization under the TPP is achieved mostly through eliminating tariffs than by renewing non-tariff barriers. The TPP parties share the objective of implementing WTO commitments by supporting the global agricultural trade reform on export subsidies and export bans, and agree to incorporate WTO-plus and WTO-beyond obligations...|$|E

40|$|Regional {{economic}} integration {{is both a}} deregulatory project, involving the removal of barriers to the movement of goods and services, {{as well as a}} re-regulatory project, involving the adoption of common economic, social, and environmental standards to enable the market to function. The removal of trade barriers can be achieved by bilateral or multilateral agreements. However, the adoption of common rules requires the delegation of agenda-setting and enforcement to a supranational body to resolve policy coordination problems and enable states to credibly commit to implement market integration. The lesson from the experience of the European Union is that such delegation, if designed carefully, need not threaten national sovereignty, which is clearly a fear in East Asia. A supranational executive can be tightly controlled by the governments if (i) unanimity is required for any decision to delegate in a particular policy area, (ii) the governments are equally represented in the executive body, and (iii) there are high decision-making thresholds and checks and balances for the adoption of policy proposals by the supranational body. Such a design requires a certain degree of preference convergence among the governments to enable the initial delegation decision to take place by unanimous agreement. It also requires the establishment of an equitable system of representation and decision-making, which allows each state a fair chance to influence policy outcomes. Preferences may not yet have converged sufficiently in East Asia, but a system of representation can be designed which would allow states to be represented equitably in a supranational decision-making structure in the region, as the ASEAN+ 3 states have started to do in the Chiang Mai Initiative <b>Multilateralization</b> framework. regional integration; East Asia; Association of South East Asian Nations; ASEAN+ 3; Chiang Mai Initiative <b>Multilateralization...</b>|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the impacts of free trade {{agreements}} (FTAs) in East Asia have assumed full utilization of preferences. The evidence suggests that this assumption is seriously in error, with the estimated uptake particularly low in East Asia. In this paper, we assume a more realistic utilization rate in estimating impacts. We find that actual utilization rates significantly diminish the benefits from preferential liberalization, but in a non-linear way. Reciprocity is an important motivation for pursuing FTAs over unilateral actions, although the Doha Round could deliver the same outcome if only it could be concluded. We isolate the impact of reciprocity, but find that the additional benefits also depend on utilization rates. Furthermore, the potential for trade deflection combined with possible retaliatory actions could negatively affect members and non-members. In the absence of Doha, the <b>multilateralization</b> of preferences, even without reciprocity, is the practical route that {{is most likely to}} deliver the greatest benefits to members.

40|$|Abstract: In the {{aftermath}} of the Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 98, East Asian finance ministers launched several new initiatives for regional financial cooperation including: (i) regional economic surveillance; (ii) a regional liquidity support arrangement; and (iii) Asian bond markets initiative. This paper evaluates the progress of such initiatives—particularly the Chiang Mai Initiative <b>Multilateralization</b> (CMIM) —and explores the possible evolution of the CMIM toward an Asian Monetary Fund (AMF). The paper argues that for an AMF to emerge, East Asian authorities need to strengthen regional surveillance and upgrade their capacity to formulate independent conditionality in the event of crisis lending so that the CMIM can be delinked from IMF programs. The paper also makes a case for more flexible use of CMIM when the type of external shock that affected the Republic of Korea in the fall of 2008 following the Lehman collapse hits Asia once again in the future. Given capital inflow risks, the paper suggests the authorities to prepare for exchange rate policy coordination—through intensive policy dialogue—to better manage macroeconomic and financial conditions while keeping intraregional exchange rate stability. An Asian Currency Unit should be developed to facilitate such policy dialogue for exchange rate polic...|$|E
