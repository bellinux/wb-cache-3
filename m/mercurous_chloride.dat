Mercury(II) chloride (also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate) was once used to treat syphilis (along with other mercury compounds), although it is so toxic that sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat. It is also used as a disinfectant. Blue mass, a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient, was prescribed throughout the 19th century for numerous conditions including constipation, depression, child-bearing and toothaches. In the early 20th century, mercury was administered to children yearly as a laxative and dewormer, and it was used in teething powders for infants. The mercury-containing organohalide merbromin (sometimes sold as Mercurochrome) is still widely used but has been banned in some countries such as the U.S.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{cases that}} arise {{are due to}} work {{exposure}} or medicinal poisoning. Environmental justice advocates can relate these mercury cases to the unregulated amount of mercury that enters the environment. Workers can be exposed to mercury through the manufacture of fluorescent tubes, chloralkali, or acetaldehyde among other products. Anthropogenic sources and places where mercury is released or used as a solid or vapor puts these has caused fatigue, dizziness, hyperhidrosis, chest congestion, and loss of motor skills.

40|$|The {{physical}} vapor transport {{method was}} used for growing <b>mercurous</b> <b>chloride</b> crystals in different convective conditions.

Results of numerical studies indicate that for a gravity level of 0. 001 g or less the Stefan wind drives the flow and no recirculating cells are observed...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this effort {{was to develop a}} method for suppressing convective flows during the growth of <b>mercurous</b> <b>chloride</b> crystals by vapor transport in closed tubes to levels approaching those obtained in the microgravity environment. <b>Mercurous</b> <b>chloride</b> was chosen because it is a technologically interesting acoustical optical material whose optical properties are believed to be affected by convective flows. Since the Grashof number scales as the cube of the smallest dimension in the flow system, reduction of the size scale can be extremely effective in reducing unwanted convective flows. However, since materials of practical interest must be grown at least on the cm scale, reduction of the overall growth system is not feasible. But if the region just above the growing crystal could be restricted to a few mm, considerable reduction in flow velocity would result. By suspending an effusive barrier in the growth ampoule just above the growth interface, {{it should be possible to}} reduce the convective velocity in this vicinity to levels approaching flows in microgravity. If successful, this growth technique will offer a screening test for proposed space experiments that involve vapor transport to see if reduction of convection will result in improved material and will set a new standard against which the improvements obtained in microgravity may be judged. In addition, it may provide an improved method for preparing materials on Earth whose growth is affected adversely by convection. If the properties of this material can be improved there is a potential commercial interest from Brimrose Inc., who has agreed to fabricate and test devices from the crystals we have grown. This report describes the development of the growth facility, the purification processes developed for preparing the starting material, and the results from growth experiments with and without the effusive baffle. <b>Mercurous</b> <b>chloride</b> turned out to be a more difficult material to deal with than originally anticipated. At growth temperatures, it is extremely sensitive to practically any impurity which causes it to form oxychlorides and/or to decompose into elemental mercury and bichloride of mercury. We were unable to find a suitable method for protecting the magnetic material used to suspend the effusion barrier from the attack of <b>mercurous</b> <b>chloride</b> vapor. Although we were successful in growing single crystals of <b>mercurous</b> <b>chloride</b> without the effusion baffle, they exhibited severe microcracking which we attribute to wall-induced thermal stresses. This leads us to believe that uncontrolled convection may not be the most important problem in the development of this material and a new growth process was attempted that eliminates the wall-induced stress. Unfortunately, the grant ran out before this new method could be adequately tested...|$|E

40|$|From Introduction]. In 1955, Dry and Gledhill, both {{formerly}} of this Department, published their {{paper on the}} Solubility of <b>Mercurous</b> <b>Chloride</b> in Water at 25 ° 0, and it was originally intended that this thesis should be {{an extension of the}} study to cover the temperature range from 5 t o 55 ° 0. A preliminary investigation at 25 ° 0, however, failed to yield results which were consistent with their findings, even though their apparatus and experimental technique were used. In an effort to resolve these difficulties their method of saturating the calomel in the conductance cell was thoroughly investigated, and as this procedure was found to be responsible, it was necessary to evolve an entirely new approach. The technique finally adopted was to saturate the <b>mercurous</b> <b>chloride</b> solutions by mechanical stirring in siliconed vessels and to carry out the conductance, pH, and total mercury concentration measurements on the filter ed solution. This method gave good results, and was free from the many extrapolations prevalent in the original procedure...|$|E
