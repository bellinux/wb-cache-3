40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the detailed evolution of the SAz- 1 smectite in 1 M KOH at 80 °C at a solid/liquid ratio of 1 / 80. AFM observations indicated no change in crystal size or shape. XRD measurements at 40 % relative humidity revealed changes in expandability of the smectite. The 001 reflection profile of smectite was modelled using the trial-and-error approach of Sakharov et al., 1999 b. The results indicate that with increasing run time the number of non expandable layers with zero or one water layer increases and that the coherent scattering domain size of the smectite decreases. Infrared spectroscopy of the reacted smectite suggests that there is no change from the initial clay products. The dehydroxylation temperature showed a slight decrease from 619 ° to 605 °C. STA measurements demonstrated that the cis-vacant character of the octahedral sheet remained nearly unchanged throughout the experiment. Determination of the average layer charge showed a continuous increase from 0. 32 to 0. 42 eq/Si (Si/Al) 4 O 10 whereas the layer charge distribution indicated the appearance of high charged smectite layers with a charge of ~ 0. 6 eq/Si (Si/Al) 4 O 10 and the disappearance of the low charged layers. XPS and SEM measurements indicate an increase of the aluminium in the smectite samples. Isotope data support the theory of a internal diffusion mechanism by gradual changes in δ 18 O values. From these data it appears that KOH solutions provoke a <b>mineralogical</b> <b>change</b> in the 2 : 1 layer of the smectite minerals which increases the layer charge by increasing the Al content.

In the particular case of porphyry copper deposits, which are produced by ore-forming magmatic-hydrothermal systems, whole-rock REE concentrations commonly show an unusual depletion in the final phase of magmatism associated with the main ore-forming stage. Interpretation of REE signatures requires establishing whether they result from magmatic or hydrothermal fractionation processes, or a combination of both. We investigated whole-rock trace-element and REE patterns of samples from the giant Ok Tedi porphyry copper-gold deposit, Papua New Guinea, and found that REEs were most depleted in zones of greatest hydrothermal alteration. REE-rich accessory phases zircon, apatite, and titanite have lower modal abundances and become smaller and more anhedral in these intensely altered zones as compared to less altered rocks. This <b>mineralogical</b> <b>change</b> is accompanied by depletions in P, Ti, Y, and Zr, and deviations of Zr/Hf and Y/Ho from chondritic trace-element ratios-chemical signatures indicative of hydrothermal fractionation. We conclude that destruction of REE-rich accessory minerals, particularly apatite, has led to hydrothermal remobilization and depletion of REEs.

This study reports the effects of phase changes on the bonding property of geopolymer to hydrated cement. A geopolymer binder was prepared by activation of heated kaolin with sodium silicate solution, bonded with 28 days aged cement paste and cured under different conditions. The experimental results demonstrated that under the 20 C air curing conditions, the bond strength achieved 1. 3 MPa at 7 days and increased to 1. 5 MPa at 28 days. While under the 80 C steam and water curing conditions, the bond strength decreased by 31 % and 37 % respectively. The XRD, FTIR and SEM analysis of the geopolymers and hydrated cement pastes show that the strength loss is due to two factors: (1) the increased porosity in cement paste due to the water loss and/or crystallization of C-S-Hs; and (2) the <b>mineralogical</b> <b>change</b> (crystallization) in geopolymer binder which becomes more ordered structures.
