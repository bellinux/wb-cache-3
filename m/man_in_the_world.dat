5|$|Goldfinger is {{the seventh}} novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series, first {{published}} in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 23 March 1959. Goldfinger originally bore the title The Richest <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> and was written in January and February 1958. The story centres on the investigation by MI6 operative James Bond into the gold smuggling activities of Auric Goldfinger, who is also suspected by MI6 of being connected to SMERSH, the Soviet counter-intelligence organisation. As well as establishing the background to the smuggling operation, Bond uncovers a much larger plot, with Goldfinger planning to steal the gold reserves of the United States from Fort Knox.|$|E
5|$|Goldfinger {{was written}} in Jamaica at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in January and February 1958 and was the longest typescript Fleming had {{produced}} to that time. He initially gave the manuscript the title The Richest <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>World.</b> Fleming had originally conceived the card game scene as a separate short story but instead used the device for Bond and Goldfinger's first encounter. Similarly, the depressurisation of Goldfinger's plane was another plot device he had intended to use elsewhere, but which {{found its way into}} Goldfinger. Some years previously a plane had depressurised over the Lebanon and an American passenger had been sucked out of the window and Fleming, who was not a comfortable airline passenger, had made note of the incident to use it.|$|E

Despite his wealth and {{extensive}} business travel, Gates usually flew coach in commercial aircraft until 1997, {{when he bought}} a private jet. Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not the richest <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> because he disliked the attention it brought. In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List. Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014 (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from 40billion to more than 82billion.
