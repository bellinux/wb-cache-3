40|$|Genetic {{algorithms}} typically use crossover, which {{relies on}} mating {{a set of}} selected parents. As part of crossover, random mating is often carried out. A novel approach to parent mating is presented in this work. Our novel approach can be applied in combination with a traditional similarity-based criterion to measure distance between individuals or with a fitness-based criterion. We introduce a parameter called <b>mating</b> <b>index</b> that allows different mating strategies to be developed within a uniform framework: from an exploitative strategy called BEST-FIRST to an explorative one called BEST- LAST. SELF-ADAPTIVE mating is defined {{in the context of}} the novel algorithm in order to achieve a balance between exploitation and exploration in a domain-independent manner. The present work formally defines the novel mating approach, analyzes its behavior, and conducts an extensive experimental study to quantitatively determine its benefits. In the domain of real function optimization, the experiments show that, as the degree of multimodality of the function at hand grows, it is convenient to in- crease the <b>mating</b> <b>index</b> in order to obtain good performance.

The objective of this study was to estimate the sexual compatibility, mating performance and relative sterility between laboratory and wild flies of the Mediterranean fruit fly, C. capitata by new indices (relative <b>mating</b> <b>index,</b> RMI; relative isolation index, RII; isolation index, ISI; male relative performance index, MRPI; female relative performance index, FRPI and relative sterility index, RSI). The results revealed that different doses of gamma radiation 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 Gy had no effect on the various parameters of mating compatibility, performance and competitiveness of lab strain males of medflies when mated with wild males. Moreover, no significant assortative or disassortative mating was observed. Therefore, we suggest that the lab strain males of medfly are compatible of mating with the wild males, at least under the laboratory conditions employed here. ...|$|E

Estimated doses, based on feed consumption and body weight, averaged 152, 636, and 1262 mg/kg body wt during Week 1 for males for 1000, 4500, and 9000 ppm, respectively. During 14 weeks of cohabitation, fertility of Fo mice was partially reduced at 4500 ppm and totally eliminated at 9000 ppm. No litters, dead or alive, were produced by 9000 ppm cohabited pairs. Among the litters born at 4500 ppm, live litter size and body weight were significantly reduced. A crossover mating trial of control and 4500 ppm groups confirmed the male as the affected sex, with fertility rates and the <b>mating</b> <b>index</b> significantly lower in the 4500 male X 0 ppm female group. At necropsy, after 27 weeks of BORA exposure, dose-related changes were present in Fo males for reduced body and reproductive organ weights, increased incidence of abnormal sperm, decreased sperm concentration and motility, and seminiferous tubule degeneration. In the 4500 ppm females, dietary BORA for 27 weeks caused significantly decreased weights of kidney/adrenals and livers; kidney/adrenal weight was also reduced in 4500 ppm males.

To validate a novel X ray irradiator, a series of studies on Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) and Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae) were carried out, comparing the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) between X rays and traditional gamma radiation from (60) Co. Male C. capitata pupae and pupae of both sexes of A. fraterculus, both 24 - 48 h before adult emergence, were irradiated with doses ranging from 15 to 120 Gy and 10 - 70 Gy, respectively. Estimated mean doses of 91. 2 Gy of X and 124. 9 Gy of gamma radiation induced 99 % sterility in C. capitata males, Irradiated A. fraterculus were 99 % sterile at approximate to 40 - 60 Gy for both radiation treatments. Standard quality control parameters and <b>mating</b> <b>indices</b> were not significantly affected by the two types of radiation.

The major {{objectives of the}} present study were to investigate the male reproductive toxicity of ME and the underlying mechanisms of toxicity. Male Wistar rats were exposed to ME by inhalation 1 h each in the morning and afternoon, Monday through Friday. Exposures to 1 : 50 diluted ME for 4 weeks or to 1 : 10 diluted ME for 2 and 4 weeks showed concentration- and time-dependent decreases of testicular weight, spermatid number, and cauda epididymal sperm number. Subsequent studies were done using 4 -week exposure to 1 : 10 diluted ME. ME caused histopathological changes including testicular spermatocytic necrosis and seminiferous tubule atrophy and cauda epididymal formation of clusters of pyknotic and necrotic sperm cells. ME-exposed male rats mated with untreated females showed decreases of male <b>mating</b> <b>index</b> and female fertility index and an increase of implantation site loss. ME decreased 7 -ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase and superoxide dismutase activities but induced proinflammatory cytokine interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) messenger RNA (mRNA) in the testis. Male rats were exposed to ME with or without cotreatment with 50 mg/kg vitamin E orally for 4 weeks. ME decreased serum testosterone concentration. This effect was reversed by cotreatment with vitamin E. ME decreased testicular spermatid number and induced IL- 6 mRNA and protein. These effects were also reversed by the vitamin E cotreatment.

40|$|Phytosterol esters (PE) are {{intended}} {{for use as a}} novel food ingredient with plasma cholesterol lowering activity which works by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol from the gut. Although PE are naturally present in the normal diet, the levels are insufficiently large to ensure lowering of plasma cholesterol levels. Therefore PE may be added to spreads to achieve the desired cholesterol lowering activity. As part of an extensive programme of safety evaluation studies a two-generation reproduction study has been conducted in Wistar rats, in which the possible effect of PE on male and female reproductive performance and on the growth and development of the offspring was studied. Rats were fed diets containing PE at levels of 0, 1. 6, 3. 2 and 8. 1 % (w/w) PE over two successive generations, and a wide range of reproductive and developmental parameters, including sexual maturation parameters and oestrous cycle length, were determined. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations were conducted including a histological examination of selected organs from F 1 - and F 2 -weanlings and from F 0 - and F 1 -parental animals. Daily clinical observations did not reveal any unusual findings. In both generations, no effects of PE were observed on pup mortality (calculated on litter basis), precoital time, <b>mating</b> <b>index,</b> male and female fertility index, female fecundity index, gestation index, duration of gestation, number of females with stillborn pups, post-implantation loss and pup development. Furthermore, PE had no effect on sexual maturation parameters (preputial separation and vaginal opening) and oestrous cycle length. In addition, there were no dose-related effects on selected organs following histological examination. In conclusion, dietary administration of up to 8. 1 % PE (equivalent to a dose of 2. 5 to 9. 1 g PE/kg body weight/day, dependent on the period of the study) during two generations had no effect on reproduction of parental F 0 - and F 1 -generation Wistar rats, nor {{on the development of the}} F 1 - and F 2 -pups, nor on the sexual maturation of the F 1 -weanlings. Therefore, a nominal dietary PE concentration of 8. 1 % (equivalent to a dose of 2. 5 - 9. 1 g PE/kg body weight/day or 1. 54 - 5. 62 g phytosterol/kg body weight/day dependent on the period of the study) was considered to be the no-observed-adverse-effect level following daily oral administration of PE for two successive generations.

40|$|Combination of {{the sterile}} insect {{technique}} with the incompatible insect technique {{is considered to}} be a safe approach to control Aedes albopictus populations in the absence of an accurate and scalable sex separation system or genetic sexing strain. Our previous study has shown that the triple Wolbachia-infected Ae. albopictus strain (wAlbA, wAlbB and wPip) was suitable for mass rearing and females could be completely sterilized as pupae with a radiation dose of at least 28 Gy. However, whether this radiation dose can influence the mating competitiveness of the triple infected males was still unknown. In this study we aimed to evaluate the effects of irradiation on the male mating competitiveness of the triple infected strain under laboratory and semi-field conditions. The results herein indicate that irradiation with a lower, female-sterilizing dose has no negative impact on the longevity of triple infected males while a reduced lifespan was observed in the wild type males (wAlbA and wAlbB) irradiated with a higher male-sterilizing dose, in small cages. At different sterile: fertile release ratios in small cages, triple-infected males induced 39. 8, 81. 6 and 87. 8 % sterility in a wild type female population at 1 : 1, 5 : 1 and 10 : 1 release ratios, respectively, relative to a fertile control population. Similarly, irradiated triple infected males induced 31. 3, 70. 5 and 89. 3 % sterility at 1 : 1, 5 : 1 and 10 : 1 release ratios, respectively, again relative to the fertile control. Under semi-field conditions at a 5 : 1 release ratio, relative to wild type males, the mean male <b>mating</b> competitiveness <b>index</b> of 28 Gy irradiated triple-infected males was significantly higher than 35 Gy irradiated wild type males, while triple infected males showed no difference in mean mating competitiveness to either irradiated triple-infected or irradiated wild type males. An unexpected difference was also observed in the relative male mating competitiveness of the triple infected strain after irradiation at 28 Gy dose in small vs large cages, with a higher male <b>mating</b> competitiveness <b>index</b> calculated from results of experiments in the large cages. Based on these results, we consider that the male mating performance of the triple infected strain after irradiation at 28 Gy, a dose required for complete female sterility and the avoidance of population replacement, is approximately equal to that of the wild type males under semi-field conditions. Though field evaluation is required, this suggests that the triple infected strain is suitable for irradiation and release as part of a combined SIT-IIT approach to Ae. albopictus control...|$|R

Methods: Ten groups were assigned to 2 control and 8 experimental groups. On the control groups 1 and 2 no treatment was conducted, but in the control group 2, after 10 days the mice were mated. In experimental groups 1 and 2, the animals received DPP (100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively) byoral administration for 10 days. In experimental groups 3 and 4 percentage of mating was evaluatedafter 10 days. Experimental groups 5 and 6 received DPP during gestation. Embryos were removedto evaluate ovaries histology. For experimental groups 7 and 8, DPP was administered until 21 thday after birth. The offspring ovaries were removed to evaluate histological parameters.

DBP consumption by F 0 rats reduced the total number of live pups per litter in all treated groups by 8 - 17 % and live pup weights in the 0. 5 % and 1. 0 % dose groups by < 13 %. In tests to determine the affected sex, the number of offspring was unchanged, but the weights of pups from treated females were significantly decreased and offspring from treated males were unchanged. At necropsy, high-dose F 0 females had a 14 % reduction in body weight, and both sexes had approximately 10 - 15 % increased kidney and liver to body weight ratios compared to controls.

40|$|Thesis (PhD(Agric)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. The {{sugarcane}} borer, Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is {{the most}} limiting factor in the South African sugar industry with losses to this insect pest estimated {{to be at least}} ZAR 60 million per annum. Because of its cryptic nature as well as the fact that E. saccharina is both indigenous to Africa and occurs on several host plants, attempts to control or eradicate it using several available methods have not been very successful. However, the sterile insect technique (SIT) is one of the newer control methods that can be incorporated into an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) programme to achieve better control or eradication. The implementation of the SIT program needs to go through a series of well-researched phases in order to be successful. In the first of this multi-phase project, it was determined that E. saccharina is susceptible to ionizing radiation, and is thus a suitable candidate for the SIT development against it and that a sub-sterilizing dose of 200 Gy is sufficient to induce F 1 (inherited) sterility in male and complete sterility in female moths respectively. The results presented here are discussed in the context of further development of the SIT as an addition to the arsenal of tactics in an AW-IPM programme against E. saccharina. Based on these initial findings, the study examined the lek and mating behavior of male moths subjected to three radiation doses (150, 200, 250 Gy) against normal non-irradiated/fertile moths. Both mass-rearing and irradiation of E. saccharina led to a quantitative departure of male mating behavior away from that exhibited by their wild counterparts. However, treated males are still able to form leks and mate with wild females. Male E. saccharina irradiated at all three doses tested were found to be as active and competitive as wild males, but in some of the traits measured, performance diminished significantly with an increase in the radiation dosage. In general, the performance of moths treated at 200 Gy did not differ significantly from that of moths treated at 150 Gy and therefore the former dose is ideal for SIT development since it results in a lower residual F 1 fertility than the latter. The level of mating competitiveness and compatibility was assessed under both laboratory and semi-field conditions in pairwise comparisons consisting of laboratory reared vs. wild (L-W), 200 Gy irradiated vs. wild (S-W) and laboratory reared vs. irradiated moths (L-S). Based on the results from the more robust field cage assays, the <b>mating</b> <b>indices</b> generated indicated that the mass-reared E. saccharina strain produced in South Africa has not yet evolved sexual behaviours suggestive of incipient pre-mating isolation barriers with local wild strains. Wild moths did not discriminate against either the partially sterile or laboratory reared moths and most importantly, the irradiated males mated significantly more than their wild counterparts regardless of the type of female. The irradiated insects could therefore achieve the purpose for which they are intended upon release into the field. Third, the critical thermal limits (CTLs) to activity at high and low temperatures (i. e. critical thermal maxima “CTmax” and minima “CTmin”) of different E. saccharina strains/treatments were investigated under standard experimental conditions. The effect of laboratory rearing and increasing radiation dosage on thermal tolerance of the adult stage of E. saccharina was explored. There were highly significant differences between the laboratory-reared and wild strain and also between non-irradiated and irradiated strains in both CTmax and CTmin. Laboratory reared E. saccharina moths were more heat tolerant compared to wild moths for both genders while in the case of CTmin, the reverse was true. Irradiation had a negative effect on both CTmax and CTmin. Moths treated at the lowest radiation dose were more cold and heat tolerant than those treated at higher dosages thereby reinforcing the importance of lower dosages rather than those that induce full sterility against E. saccharina. In general, gender effects on the CTLs were non-significant. Pilot sterile male releases in shade house trials to measure the impact of sustained releases of partially sterile adult males at an over-flooding moth ratio of 10 T: 1 U (treated to untreated),were conducted to measure their efficacy to stop E. saccharina incursions and suppress populations prior to testing in pilot studies under true season-long and area wide conditions. Results from the current study demonstrated that releasing partially irradiated (200 Gy) adult male moths at the afore mentioned release rate significantly reduced sugarcane stalk damage as well as lowered the number of fertile progeny from F 1 to succeeding generations in a stable E. saccharina population initiated in a cage house. There were more damaged internodes per stalk in the control than in the sugarcane receiving regular releases of partially sterile male moths. Overall, there were significantly more undamaged stalks in the treated sugarcane than the untreated control. Furthermore, there were significantly more larvae per stalk retrieved from the control compared to the treated sugarcane suggesting that the sustained release of steriles was efficacious in reducing emergence of fertile larvae in the succeeding generations. The results {{of this study indicate that}} there is considerable scope for the SIT against E. saccharina...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} inhibitors of {{methylation}} {{to evaluate the}} proposal that the extent of methylation of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) of the mating type-plus (mt+) parent occurring during gametogenesis in wild-type Chlamydomonas renhardtii is directly correlated with the uniparental transmission of chloroplast genes by this parent [Sager, R., Grabowy, C. & Sano, H. (1981) Cell 24, 41 - 47]. As detected by high-pressure liquid chromatography, the methylation of cpDNA was at its lowest level in the vegetative stage; the mt+ cells had a deoxycytidine methylation index (the percentage of deoxycytidine methylated) of 0. 5, while the <b>mating</b> type-minus (mt-) <b>index</b> was lower by at least a factor of 3. This basal level of cpDNA methylation increased more than 20 -fold after gametogenesis to give a methylation index of 12. 1 and 4. 3 for mt+ and mt- gametes, respectively. Another striking increase was detected at the 7 -hr-zygote stage, resulting in the methylation of {{nearly half of the}} total deoxycytidine residues. The extent of zygotic cpDNA methylation was shown to be dependent on the preexisting methylation level of both parental gametic cpDNAs. L-Ethionine and 5 -azacytidine effectively inhibited cpDNA methylation during gametogenesis and ensuing zygotic development as shown by both Hpa II/Msp I digestion patterns and HPLC. The transmission of chloroplast genes was analyzed concomitantly with the inhibitor studies. The two inhibitors produced different patterns of inhibition of methylation in mt- and mt+ cells at a given developmental stage. Our overall results demonstrate that the extent of mating type-specific and gamete-specific methylation during gametogenesis is not correlated with the frequency of maternal transmission of chloroplast genes...|$|R
40|$|Background. Schima wallichii is {{a highly}} {{valuable}} tree of tropical forest in north-east Himalaya region that grows naturally {{in a wide range}} of altitudes between 750 and 2400 [*]m[*]asl with varying environments. Flowering phenology of tropical tree species at population level is generally ignored and therefore a detailed knowledge of flowering and fruiting patterns of important multipurpose tree species is critical to the successful management of forest genetic resources. Materials and Methods. The study was conducted at two different altitudes (i. e., 750 [*]m and 900 [*]m[*]asl) in the tropical semideciduous forest of north-east Himalaya. The floral phenology including flowering synchrony in the populations, anthesis, anther dehiscence, stigma receptivity, pollinators visitation frequency, and <b>mating</b> system including <b>index</b> of self-incompatibility were worked out in Schima wallichii according to the ear-marked standard methods given by various scientists for each parameter. Results. The flowering period in Schima wallichii varied from 33 to 42 days with mean synchrony of 0. 54 to 0. 68 between the populations. The stigma was receptive up to 2. 5 days only and showed slightly protandrous type of dichogamy. Average pollen production ranged between 6. 90 × 107 pollen per tree in 2007 and 15. 49 × 108 pollen per tree in 2011. A three-year masting cycle was noticed in this species. The frequency of visitation of honey bees was fairly high (5. 2 ± 1. 12 visits/flower/hour) as compared to other pollinators. The hand pollination revealed maximum fruit (74. 2 ± 5. 72 %) and seed (70. 8 ± 7. 46 %) settings. Conclusions. The variation in flowering phenology and pollen yield individually and annually along with temporal separation in anther dehiscence and pollinator’s visitation cause pollen limited reproduction, which ultimately influences the reproductive success in Schima wallichii...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous hypospadias {{is seldom}} {{observed}} in rats {{in contrast to}} its occurrence in 1 out of 250 human births. Ziracin, an antibacterial of the everninomycin class under development for serious enterococcal, staphylococcal, and streptococcal infections, caused anomalies of the external genitalia in F 1 female rats and decreased reproductive performance. To characterize the urogenital malformations and determine the period of sensitivity {{to the effects of}} Ziracin during development, pregnant rats (F 0) were administered 60 mg/kg IV of Ziracin from GD 6 to LD 21, GD 6 to 13, GD 14 to the last day of gestation or LD 0 to 21. Controls received saline or placebo from GD 6 to LD 21. Ziracin-induced changes occurred in F 1 rats exposed from GD 6 to LD 21 and GD 14 to the last day of gestation, indicating that the period of sensitivity to Ziracin was from GD 14 to the last day of gestation. The urogenital abnormalities consisted of cranial displacement of the urethral opening within the vagina from its normal location {{at the tip of the}} genital tubercle. When the urethrovaginal junction occurred at the distal third of the vagina, it created an urogenital cloaca. As a result, ascending infections were seen in the urinary and genital tract. No differences in survivability, body weight, and date of vaginal opening were observed in F 1 females. The estrous cycles were slightly prolonged. The <b>mating</b> and fertility <b>indices</b> were decreased as a result of the urogenital anomalies. The mammary glands of pregnant F 1 females were underdeveloped, thus F 2 pups from affected F 1 females had a decreased survival rate. Although the cause of these effects is not known, the findings are consistent with a potential hormonal mechanism...|$|R
