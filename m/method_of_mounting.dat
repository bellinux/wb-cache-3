50|$|A polar aligned (or equatorial) mount is a {{well known}} {{standard}} <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>mounting</b> many types of telescope. The tilted single axis is aligned to the polar star in the northern hemisphere, or equivalently to {{the extension of the}} south pole in the southern hemisphere. It is therefore called a polar aligned single axis tracker (PASAT). In this particular implementation of a tilted single axis tracker, the tilt angle is equal to the site latitude. This aligns the tracker axis of rotation with the earth’s axis of rotation.|$|E

50|$|An {{asymmetric}} tire may {{refer to}} a tire whose tread pattern does not form in line symmetry or point symmetry vis-à-vis its central line, thus having a distinct inside and outside edge. They may be mounted {{on either side of}} the vehicle. Since the tread pattern of many ordinary tires do not form symmetry in relation to design or pattern noise, the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>mounting</b> tires is specially prescribed. This type of tires is used in many cases to promote tire performance, braking performance, and turning performance, since tread contact changes according to the change in alignment during travel.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} part of the twentieth century, {{following}} the termination of Ward's Society of American Taxidermists, individuals such as Akeley, Hornaday, and Leon Pray had refined techniques and begun emphasizing artistry. Akeley, specifically, is responsible for devising a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>mounting</b> that is now standard. In this process, [...] "the true contours of the specimen are preserved by making a clay model, exactly duplicating the animal's muscle structure, over an armature that includes the original skeleton or parts of it. A plaster mold is then made, from which is produced a light, durable frame that holds the skin in position. Synthetic materials, especially celluloid, are now often used to reproduce the true color and translucence of such specimens as reptiles and fishes." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1851 John Benjamin Dancer invented microphotographs using a {{collodion}} {{process and}} a microscope {{converted to a}} camera. This resulted in a microphotograph about 3 mm2 in area. The main disadvantage of Dancer's method was that the viewing of the microphotographs required a microscope which {{was at the time}} an expensive instrument. In 1857 Dagron solved the problem by inventing a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>mounting</b> the microphotographs {{at the end of a}} small cylindrical lens. Dagron modified the Stanhope lens by sectioning the normally biconvex Stanhope lens and introducing a planar section so that the plane was located at the focal length of the convex side of the cylindrical lens. This produced a plano-convex lens, where Dagron was able to mount the microscopic photograph on the flat side of the lens using Canada balsam as adhesive. This arrangement enabled the picture to be focused.|$|E

5000|$|Other nations {{tended to}} work on truck chassis. Starting in 1941, the British {{developed}} the [...] "en portee" [...] <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>mounting</b> an anti-tank gun (initially a 2 pounder) on a truck. This was to prevent the weapon from being damaged by long-distance towing across rough, stony deserts, and it was intended only to be a carrying method, with the gun unloaded for firing. However, crews tended to fire their weapons from their vehicles for the mobility this method provided, with consequent casualties. [...] This undoubtedly inspired their Morris C9/B (officially the [...] "Carrier, SP, 4x4, 40 mm AA"), a Bofors 40 mm AA gun mounted on a chassis derived from the Morris [...] "Quad" [...] Field Artillery Tractor truck. Similar types, based on 3-ton lorries, were produced in Britain, Canada and Australia, and together formed the most numerous self-propelled AA guns in British service.|$|E
50|$|Originally it {{was thought}} that the two radii could exist on their own and {{terminate}} at the ring, however the dynamic passenger inflow immediately made the Metro planners realise the mistake. In an effort to correct this, it was decided to link the radii into a diameter and relieve the ring by allowing several transfer points inside the circumference. In 1970 the first extension northwards from Oktyabrskaya took place where the line met up with the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya Line at Kitay-gorod, for the first time, a combined cross-platform transfer was opened with both stations built simultaneously. Finally at the end of 1971 the lines linked up with the central section forming the Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line. The two stations that formed the final junction, used a new <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>mounting</b> hydroisolation, which was made separately and then suspended instead of mounting it piece by piece. This allowed a three-month work to be finished in little more than a week.|$|E
50|$|Helmet: Helmets are {{particularly}} popular with sidemount divers, as {{they provide a}} convenient mounting point for primary and/or back-up lights. The primary function of the helmet remains to provide head protection in overhead environments. Sidemount configuration can mean that the more typical <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>mounting</b> back-up lights below the diver's shoulder D-rings becomes less favorable. This area is more heavily loaded with bungee and deco stage attachments, reducing access to back-up lights stowed from the D-ring. Mounting primary lights on the helmet can be advantageous as it frees up the hands in very confined spaces and/or when heavily task-loaded with other equipment. The draw-backs to helmet mounted lights are that it can {{increase the risk of}} snagging the helmet on obstructions and an increased potential to inadvertently dazzling dive buddies. Sidemount divers may choose to make their own helmet by adapting an existing climbing, kayaking or skate-boarding helmet, or may purchase an off-the-shelf cave/sidemount diving helmet.|$|E
40|$|The light {{collection}} {{capability of}} an interferometer {{is dependent on}} the aperture size of the instrument. Increasing the aperture size can reduce the noise level of the instrument. Instruments that collect light at wavelengths longer than about 15 µm often use Potassium Bromide (KBr) beamsplitters. KBr has a high coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and low strength, which make it difficult to mount in a robust manner. As a result, many engineers have been hesitant to design their instruments using the full aperture size required for optimal performance. The overall objective of this effort was to examine novel <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>mounting</b> KBr beamsplitters to improve their vibrational, optical, and thermal characteristics. A new thermally engineered composite material (TECMat) was developed that appears to match the CTE of KBr over a wide temperature range. TECMat’s material properties and possible <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> implementing it in beamsplitter mounts are described...|$|R

5000|$|As in the US, {{suspects}} in some Commonwealth countries are also entitled to have counsel present during questioning.
