50|$|Titan {{differed}} from the original Manchester Atlas by having a real, but cached, main memory, rather than the paged (or virtual) memory used in the Manchester machine. It initially had 28K of memory, but this was expanded first to 64K and later to 128K. The Titan's main memory had 128K of 48-bit words and was implemented using ferrite core store rather than the part core, part rotating drum-store used on the Manchester Atlas. Titan also had two large hard-disk drives and several <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>decks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Data storage was {{strictly}} serial on paper tape, {{and then later}} to magnetic tape: the use of data storage within readily accessible memory was not cost-effective.Significant developments took place in 1959 with IBM announcing the 1401 computer and in 1962 with ICT (International Computers & Tabulators) making delivery of the ICT 1301. Like all machines during this time the core processor together with the peripherals - <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>decks,</b> discs, drums, printers and card and paper tape input and output required considerable space in specially constructed air conditioned accommodation. Often parts of the punched card installation, in particular sorters, were retained to present the card input to the computer in a pre-sort form that reduced the processing time involved in sorting large amounts of data.|$|R

50|$|An audio <b>tape</b> recorder, <b>tape</b> <b>deck</b> or <b>tape</b> {{machine is}} an analog audio storage device that records and plays back sounds, {{including}} articulated voices, usually using <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape,</b> either wound on a reel or in a cassette, for storage. In its present-day form, it records a fluctuating signal {{by moving the}} tape across a tape head that polarizes the magnetic domains in the tape {{in proportion to the}} audio signal. Tape-recording devices include reel-to-reel <b>tape</b> <b>deck</b> and the cassette deck.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "High Speed" [...] <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> system (called tape type 1) used one-inch-wide (25.4 mm) <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> {{running at}} 150 inches per second, with sixteen tracks at a density of 300 bits per inch. Eight {{of the tracks}} held data, with check data on the other eight, {{allowing}} single-bit errors to be corrected and double-bit errors to be detected. Up to eight <b>tape</b> <b>decks</b> could be connected, giving a throughput of 90,000 digits per second. Spools could hold up to 3600 ft of tape and were of three-prong design.|$|R

50|$|The {{standard}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> system (called tape type 3) used half-inch-wide (12.7 mm) <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> {{with ten}} tracks at a density of 300 bits per inch. Four {{of the tracks}} held data, four more tracks held the inverse of the data {{and there was a}} parity bit for both groups of four. This allowed single-bit errors to be corrected and double-bit errors to be detected. Up to eight Ampex TM4 <b>tape</b> <b>decks,</b> running at 75 inches per second for a throughput of 22,500 digits per second, could be connected. Spools could hold up to 3600 ft of tape and were of the three-prong design common at the time for professional audio recorders rather than the later industry standard expanding-hub design.|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s sets {{such as the}} Roberts RM33 {{incorporated}} up to five {{buttons on}} which radio stations could be preset. This feature has continued through to sets issued present day. With the development of <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> data storage, sets were produced with either a single or dual <b>tape</b> <b>deck.</b> This gave visually impaired people the additional option of listening to pre-recorded music and books and of recording messages to send to friends and family. The Roberts RSR50 incorporated a cassette tape facility as well as having large buttons, and tone and balance controls.|$|R

50|$|When Martin {{heard the}} tapes, he was {{impressed}} by the performances but disappointed by the sound quality. In working on the three-track Hollywood Bowl concert tapes, Martin discovered quite a challenge. The first difficulty was finding a working three-track machine with which to play them. Once he found one, he discovered that the machine overheated when it was running, melting the <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape.</b> Martin and recording engineer Geoff Emerick came up with the solution of blowing air from a vacuum cleaner to keep the <b>tape</b> <b>deck</b> cool whilst the recordings were transferred to 16-track tape for filtering, equalisation, editing, and mixing. Martin found the 29 August 1965 recording virtually useless, and, except for a few dubs taken from the performance of 29 August to augment other performances, the album compiled by Martin consisted entirely of songs recorded on 23 August 1964 and 30 August 1965.|$|R
