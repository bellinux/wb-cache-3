50|$|WLTL {{launched}} in January 1968 as a 10 watt radio {{station on the}} third floor of the Vaughan Building at LTHS' North Campus, with a simple omnidirectional antenna. WLTL originally operated on an assigned frequency of 88.3 MHz, but by 1969 changed frequency to 88.1 to permit WHSD, Hinsdale to operate on 88.5 and avoid having the two relatively close stations operate on adjacent channels. While licensed to operate at 10 watts, with a transmitter capable only of 10 watts power output, and a single bay horizontally polarized antenna with inexpensive transmission line, it was estimated that the actual ERP of the station at that time was approximately 7 watts.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a new model-based {{algorithm}} for optimizing the MPEG-Advanced Audio Coder (AAC) in MS-stereo mode is presented. This {{algorithm is}} an extension to stereo signals of prior work on a statistical model of quantization noise. Traditionally, MS-stereo coding approaches replace the Left (L) and Right (R) channels by the Middle (M) and Sides (S) channels, each channel being independently processed, almost like a <b>monophonic</b> <b>signal.</b> In contrast, our method proposes a global approach for coding both channels in the same process. A model for the quantization error allows us to tune the quantizers on channels M and S {{with respect to a}} distortion constraint on the reconstructed channels L and R as they will appear in the decoder. This approach leads to a more efficient perceptual noise-shaping and avoids using complex psychoacoustic models built on the M and S channels. Furthermore, it provides a straightforward scheme to choose between LR and MS modes in each subband for each frame.

30|$|Extensive {{simulation}} results were reported {{with the aim}} of assessing the performance of the conventional and alternative LP models. Summarizing, we can state that a high-order all-pole model appears to be better suited to the audio LP problem than a conventional, low-order all-pole model. However, the HOLP model, which typically has half as many model parameters as the number of samples in the analysis window, is impractically complex in many applications. It could hence be expected that the PZLP model is a good alternative, since it can approximate the HOLP PEF impulse response with fewer parameters. This seems to be true only for <b>monophonic</b> audio <b>signals,</b> and even in this case, estimating the model parameters without prior knowledge on the fundamental frequency range is not a trivial task. Another good alternative to the HOLP model in the case of <b>monophonic</b> <b>signals</b> is the PLP model, especially when cascaded with a conventional LP model, as is common use in speech analysis. Finally, for polyphonic audio LP, the WLP model performance comes very close to the optimal HOLP model performance, however, the WLP model performs poorly in terms of perceptual frequency resolution, unless its model order is chosen to be an order of magnitude larger than the number of tonal components in the observed signal [12].|$|R
