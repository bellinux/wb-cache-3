5|$|Sprint was {{the primary}} weapon of Nike-X as {{originally}} conceived; {{it would have been}} placed in clusters around the targets being defended by the <b>MAR</b> system. Each missile was housed in an underground silo and was driven into the air before launch by a gas-powered piston. The missile was initially tracked by the local MSR, which would hand off tracking to the <b>MAR</b> as soon as it became visible. A transponder in the missile could respond to signals from either the <b>MAR</b> or MSR for accurate tracking.|$|E
5|$|A typical Nike-X {{deployment}} {{around a}} major city would have consisted of several missile batteries. One of these would be equipped with the <b>MAR</b> and its associated DCDP computers, while the others would optionally have an MSR. The sites were all networked together using communications equipment working at normal voice bandwidths. Some of the smaller bases would be built north of the <b>MAR</b> to provide protection to this central station.|$|E
5|$|As {{initially}} conceived, MSR was a short-range {{system for}} tracking Sprint missiles before they {{appeared in the}} MAR's view, as well as offering a secondary target and jammer tracking role. In this initial concept, the MSR would have limited processing power, just enough to create tracks to feed back to the <b>MAR.</b> In the anti-jamming role, each <b>MAR</b> and MSR would measure the angle to the jammer.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Regions of DNA {{that bind}} {{to the nuclear}} matrix, or nucleoskeleton, are known as Matrix Attachment Regions (<b>MARs).</b> <b>MARs</b> are thought to play an {{important}} role in higher-order structure and chromatin organization within the nucleus. <b>MARs</b> are also thought to act as boundaries of chromosomal domains that act to separate regions of gene-rich, decondensed euchromatin from highly repetitive, condensed heterochromatin. Herein I will present evidence that <b>MARs</b> do indeed act as domain boundaries and can prevent the spread of silencing into active genes. Many fundamental questions remain unanswered about how <b>MARs</b> function in the nucleus. New findings in epigenetics indicate that <b>MARs</b> may also play an important role in the organization of genes and the eventual transport of their mRNAs through the nuclear pore. ...|$|R

5|$|Nike-X also {{considered}} a cut down version of <b>MAR</b> known as TACMAR. This {{was essentially a}} <b>MAR</b> {{with half of the}} elements hooked up, reducing its price at the cost of shorter detection range. The processing equipment was likewise reduced in complexity, lacking some of the more sophisticated discrimination processing. TACMAR was designed from the start {{to be able to be}} upgraded to full <b>MAR</b> performance if needed, especially as the sophistication of the threat grew. MAR-II is sometimes described as the prototype TACMAR, but there is considerable confusion on this point in existing sources.|$|E
40|$|Although a gene’s {{location}} {{can greatly}} influence its expression, genome sequencing {{has shown that}} orthologous genes may exist in very different environments in the genomes of closely related species. Four genes in the maize alcohol dehydrogenase (adh 1) region represent solitary genes dispersed among large repetitive blocks, whereas the orthologous genes in sorghum are located in a different setting surrounded by low-copy-number DNAs. A specific class of DNA sequences, matrix attachment regions (<b>MARs),</b> {{was found to be}} in comparable positions in the two species, often flanking individual genes. If these <b>MARs</b> define structural domains, then the orthologous genes in maize and sorghum should experience similar chromatin environments. In addition, <b>MARs</b> were divided into two groups, based on the competitive affinity of their association with the matrix. The “durable ” <b>MARs</b> retained matrix associations at the highest concentrations of competitor DNA. Most of the durable <b>MARs</b> mapped outside genes, defining the borders of putative chromatin loops. The “unstable ” <b>MARs</b> lost their association with the matrix under similar competitor conditions and mapped mainly within introns. These results suggest that <b>MARs</b> possess both domain-defining and regulatory roles. Miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) often were found on the same fragments as the <b>MARs.</b> Our studies showed that many MITEs can bind to isolated nuclear matrices, suggesting that MITEs may function as <b>MARs</b> in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The {{continental}} margin off northeast Australia, comprising the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) platform and Queensland Trough, {{is the largest}} tropical mixed siliciclastic /carbonate depositional system in existence. We describe a suite of 35 piston cores and two Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) sites from a 130 £ 240 km rectangular area of the Queensland Trough, the slope and basin setting east of the central GBR platform. Oxygen isotope records, physical property (magnetic susceptibility and greyscale) logs, analyses of bulk carbonate content and radiocarbon ages at these locations are used to construct a high resolution stratigraphy. This information is used to quantify mass accumulation rates (<b>MARs)</b> for siliciclastic and carbonate sediments accumulating in the Queensland Trough over the last 31, 000 years. For the slope, highest <b>MARs</b> of siliciclastic sediment occur during transgression (1. 0 Million Tonnes per year; MT yr 21), and lowest <b>MARs</b> of siliciclastic (, 0. 1 MT yr 21) and carbonate (0. 2 MT yr 21) sediment occur during sea level lowstand. Carbonate <b>MARs</b> are similar to siliciclastic <b>MARs</b> for transgression and highstand (1. 1 – 1. 4 MT yr 21). In contrast, for the basin, <b>MARs</b> of siliciclastic (0 – 0. 1 MT yr 21) and carbonate sediment (0. 2 – 0. 4 MT yr 21) are continuously low, and within a factor of two, for lowstand, transgression, and highstand. Generic models for carbonate margins predict that maximum and minimum carbonate <b>MARs</b> on the slope will occur during highstand and lowstand, respectively. Conversely, most models for siliciclastic margins suggest maximum and minimum siliciclastic <b>MARs</b> will occur during lowstand and transgression, respectively. Although carbonate <b>MARs</b> in the Queensland Trough {{are similar to those}} predicted for carbonate depositional systems, siliciclastic <b>MARs</b> are the opposite. Given uniform siliciclastic <b>MARs</b> in the basin through time, we conclude that terrigenous material is stored on the shelf during sea level lowstand, and released to th...|$|R
40|$|The Arabidopsis thaliana genome is {{currently}} being sequenced, eventually leading towards the unravelling of all potential genes. We wanted to gain more insight into the way this genome might be organized at the ultrastructural level. To this extent we identified matrix attachment regions demarking potential chromatin domains, in a 16 kb region around the plastocyanin gene. The region was cloned and sequenced revealing six genes {{in addition to the}} plastocyanin gene. Using an heterologous in vitro nuclear matrix binding assay, to search for evolutionary conserved matrix attachment regions (<b>MARs),</b> we identified three such <b>MARs.</b> These three <b>MARs</b> divide the region into two small chromatin domains of 5 kb, each containing two genes. Comparison of the sequence of the three <b>MARs</b> revealed a degenerated 21 bp sequence that is shared between these <b>MARs</b> and that is not found elsewhere in the region. A similar sequence element is also present in four other <b>MARs</b> of Arabidopsis. Therefore, this sequence may constitute a landmark for the position of <b>MARs</b> in the genome of this plant. In a genomic sequence database of Arabidopsis the 21 bp element is found approximately once every 10 kb. The compactness of the Arabidopsis genome could account for the high incidence of <b>MARs</b> and MRSs we observe...|$|R

5|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the Nike-X system was <b>MAR,</b> using the then-new {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) concept to allow it to generate multiple virtual radar beams, simulating any number of mechanical radars needed. While one beam scanned the sky for new targets, others were formed to examine the threat tubes and generate high-quality tracking information very early in the engagement. More beams were formed to track the RVs once picked out, and still more to track the Sprints {{on their way to the}} interceptions. To make all of this work, <b>MAR</b> required data processing capabilities on an unprecedented level, so Bell proposed building the system using the newly invented resistor–transistor logic small-scale integrated circuits. Nike-X centralized the battle control systems at their Defense Centers, consisting of a <b>MAR</b> and its associated underground Defense Center Data Processing System (DCDPS).|$|E

40|$|The genome {{is thought}} to be divided into domains by DNA {{elements}} which mediate anchorage of chromosomal DNA to the nuclear matrix or chromosome scaffold. The positions of nuclear matrix anchorage regions (<b>MARs)</b> have been mapped within the 200 kb mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region locus, thereby allowing an estimate of the size of DNA domains within a segment of the genome. <b>MARs</b> were identified in four regions, which appear to divide the locus into looped DNA domains of 30, 20, 30 and greater than 70 kb in length. These DNA domain sizes fall within the range of DNA loop sizes observed in histone-extracted nuclei and chromosomes. In two regions, large clusters of <b>MARs</b> were identified, and many of these <b>MARs</b> lie on DNA fragments that include repetitive DNA elements, perhaps indicating that repetitive DNA integrates into the genome close to <b>MARs,</b> or that some classes of repeats could themselves act as <b>MARs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background High {{levels of}} Hepatoma Up-Regulated Protein (HURP) and Tousled-Like Kinase (TLK) {{transcripts}} {{are found in}} hepatocellular carcinoma. HURP overexpression induces anchorage-independent growth of 293 -T cells and enhances a rough-eye phenotype resulting from tlk overexpression in Drosophila. In addition, both HURP and Mars, a Drosophila HURP sequence homologue, promote polymerization of mitotic spindles. Thus, the genetic interaction of <b>mars</b> with tlk might be required for accurate chromosome segregation. Methods To reveal whether chromosome fidelity was decreased, the frequency of gynandromorphy, an individual with {{both male and female}} characteristics, and of non-disjunction were measured in the progeny from parents with reduced <b>mars</b> and/or tlk activities and analyzed by Student's t -test. To show that the genetic interaction between <b>mars</b> and tlk is epistatic or parallel, a cytological analysis of embryos with either reduced or increased activities of <b>mars</b> and/or tlk was used to reveal defects in mitotic-spindle morphology and chromosome segregation. Results A significant but small fraction of the progeny from parents with reduced <b>mars</b> activity showed gynandromorphy and non-disjunction. Results of cytological analysis revealed that the decrease in chromosome fidelity was a result of delayed polymerization of the mitotic spindle, which led to asynchronous chromosome segregation in embryos that had reduced <b>mars</b> activity. By removing one copy of tousled-like kinase (tlk) from flies with reduced <b>mars</b> activity, chromosome fidelity was further reduced. This was indicated by an increased in the non-disjunction rate and more severe asynchrony. However, the morphology of the mitotic spindles in the embryos at metaphase where both gene activities were reduced was similar to that in <b>mars</b> embryos. Furthermore, tlk overexpression did not affect the morphology of the mitotic spindles and the cellular localization of Mars protein. Conclusion Chromosome fidelity in progeny from parents with reduced <b>mars</b> and/or tlk activity was impaired. The results from cytological studies revealed that <b>mars</b> and tlk function in parallel and that a balance between <b>mars</b> activity and tlk activity is required for cells to progress through mitosis correctly, thus ensuring chromosome fidelity. </p...|$|R
