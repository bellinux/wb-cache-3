40|$|Standard {{metering}} {{of electric}} arc furnaces usually uses {{root mean square}} (RMS) or true root mean square (TRMS) measurements for determining power. Only sinusoidal signals are accurately described by RMS meters, and dc or high-frequency components normally are lost in standard TRMS metering. This can lead to inaccuracies when electrical signals are not sinusoidal, contain dc components, or include fast risetime perturbations, {{as is the case}} with the electric signals from an electric arc furnace. Electric arc furnace electrical waveforms, observed in research carried out by the U. S. Bureau of Mines, show high-frequency components and significant deviations from sinusoids. These perturbations and distortions <b>make</b> <b>metering</b> difficult for standard power meters. The inaccuracies in metering can cause further problems if those sensors are used in control systems. For control strategies requiring rapid response, any averaging scheme loses information that can be used in control decisions. In order to obtain better signals for both monitoring and control, a study of instantaneous, RMS, and TRMS power monitoring devices was conducted. From this study it was concluded that precision integrated circuits should be used to obtain instantaneous power with a bandwidth of at least 25 kHz. The information from these devices is more representative than that of standard meters and can be used in predictive control...|$|R

At the TRACON, TMC's accessed TMA in an advisory mode for different planning activities such as staffing, distributing the traffic load, and changing the airport acceptance rate.

For the grids to operate effectively, it is critical to collect readings from massively-installed smart meters to control centers in an efficient and secure manner. In this paper, we propose a secure compressed reading scheme to address this critical issue. We observe that our collected real-world meter data express strong temporal correlations, indicating they are sparse in certain domains. We adopt Compressed Sensing technique to exploit this sparsity and design an efficient meter data transmission scheme. Our scheme achieves substantial efficiency offered by compressed sensing, without the need to know beforehand in which domain the meter data are sparse. This is in contrast to traditional compressed-sensing based scheme where such sparse-domain information is required a priori.

The objective {{of this study is to}} provide EDL with the best alternatives for modernizing their electricity metering of low-voltage customers. These customers are currently being metered using a variety of old and new electromechanical meters. The metering process at EDL is manual, and prone to errors. The existing system does not provide EDL with reliable methods to readily check bills, identify problematic customers, and reduce fraud. Therefore, EDL’s modernization requirements include an automated system capable of enhancing current metering processes, minimizing fraud, and maximizing revenue collection. This paper will describe the functional requirements of EDL and investigate the feasibility of using Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) technology to satisfy these requirements. Both procedural and equipment modernization techniques will be identified and assessed. The proposed modernization system will <b>make</b> EDL’s <b>metering</b> activities as advanced as those of modern utilities.

40|$|AbstractThe lack {{of meters}} for solar water heating {{technology}} hinders the advancement and {{legitimacy of the}} technology. Less than fifteen firms worldwide <b>make</b> performance <b>meters</b> suitable to residential solar water heating systems (SWH). The price of a residential BTU meter relative to total system cost is too expensive: sometimes more than 10 %. The market is expanding for affordable meters, since the largest global growth in SWH installations is expected in the residential sector between now and 2025. To be useful, these meters must report real-time data to the Cloud and provide a user-friendly Energy Dashboard. Interviews with 26 utility executives and manufacturers in North America identified common concerns. Unmetered residential systems fail to:i) assure long-term SWH system functionality;ii) participate in the Renewable Energy Credit, CO 2 reduction, or pay-for-performance markets;iii) verify that public subsidies or rebates for SWH are well-spent;iv) use “Big Data” to innovate design or develop competitive advantage;v) provide the information key to “bragging rights,” which compel pride in ownership.

The intangible benefits that can’t be quantified are then discussed separately. The net cost for suppliers in a twenty-year horizon is substantial, especially during the peak period of roll-out. The procurement cost and installation cost are the most important parts. Variables like access rate will impose significant impact on the installation cost, for suppliers, so it is crucial to keep a high access rate to avoid labour force waste and control the installation cost.
