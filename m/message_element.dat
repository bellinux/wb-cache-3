40|$|Objectives Electronic Health Records (EHRs) {{provided}} as a lifelong patient record advance towards core applications of distributed and co-operating health information systems and health networks. For meeting {{the challenge of}} scalable, flexible, portable, secure EHR systems, the underlying EHR architecture {{must be based on}} the component paradigm and model driven, separating platform-independent and platform-specific models. Methods Allowing manageable models, real systems must be decomposed and simplified. The resulting modelling approach has to follow the ISO Reference Model – Open Distributing Processing (RM-ODP). The ISO RM-ODP describes any system component from different perspectives. Platform-independent perspectives contain the enterprise view (business process, policies, scenarios, use cases), the information view (classes and associations) and the computational view (composition and decomposition), whereas platform-specific perspectives concern the engineering view (physical distribution and realisation) and the technology view (implementation details from protocols up to education and training) on system components. Those views have to be established for components reflecting aspects of all domains involved in healthcare environments including administrative, legal, medical, technical, etc. Thus, security-related component models reflecting all view mentioned have to be established for enabling both application and communication security services as integral part of the system's architecture. Beside decomposition and simplification of system regarding the different viewpoint on their components, different levels of systems’ granularity can be defined hiding internals or focusing on properties of basic components to form a more complex structure. The resulting models describe both structure and behaviour of component-based systems. Results The described approach has been deployed in different projects defining EHR systems and their underlying architectural principles. In that context, the Australian GEHR project, the openEHR initiative, the revision of CEN ENV 13606 “Electronic Health Record communication”, all based on Archetypes, but also the HL 7 version 3 activities are discussed in some detail. The latter include the HL 7 RIM, the HL 7 Development Framework, the HL 7 's clinical document architecture (CDA) as well as the set of models from use cases, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams up to Domain Information Models (DMIMs) and their building blocks Common <b>Message</b> <b>Element</b> Types (CMET) Constraining Models to their underlying concepts.

Methods We content-analyzed one hundred Dutch webpages about Ebola, fibromyalgia, ALS, losing weight, borderline personality disorder, hemorrhoids, ADD, bladder infection, shingles, and chicken pox. The codebook covered the following domains: images and videos, readability level, Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM), advertising, interactive features, and reliability cues. Results Thirty-seven webpages contained informative images that visualized the text. Twelve webpages incorporated videos, six of which were animations. Readability varied widely, but 79. 2 % of the texts exceeded the recommended B 1 level. Half of the webpages had inadequate SAM scores; five were classified as superior. Interactive features were infrequently used. Many webpages included only a few elements that help users evaluate the reliability of OHI. Four presented a quality label.

40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has {{established}} an operational {{plan for the}} future Air Traffic Management (ATM) system, in which the Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) is envisioned to evolve into digital messaging that will take on an ever increasing role in controller to pilot communications, significantly changing the way the National Airspace System (NAS) is operating. According to FAA, CPDLC represents {{the first phase of the}} transition from the current analog voice system to an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) compliant system in which digital communication becomes the alternate and perhaps primary method of routine communication. The CPDLC application is an Air Traffic Service (ATS) application in which pilots and controllers exchange messages via an addressed data link. CPDLC includes a set of clearance, information, and request <b>message</b> <b>elements</b> that correspond to existing phraseology employed by current Air Traffic Control (ATC) procedures. These <b>message</b> <b>elements</b> encompass altitude assignments, crossing constraints, lateral deviations, route changes and clearances, speed assignments, radio frequency assignments, and various requests for information. The pilot is provided with the capability to respond to messages, to request clearances and information, to report information, and to declare/rescind an emergency. A 'free text' capability is also provided to exchange information not conforming to defined formats. This paper presents simulated results of the aeronautical telecommunication application Controller Pilot Data Link Communications over VHF Digital Link Mode 3 (VDL Mode 3). The objective of this simulation study was to determine the impact of CPDLC traffic loads, in terms of timely message delivery and capacity of the VDL Mode 3 subnetwork.

Also, the values of the message bits are calculated through this scheme; finally we can calculatethe codeword by multiplying the message word (just decoded) with the generator matrix.|$|R
40|$|A {{considerable}} body {{of literature}} on consumers’ responses to information about firms’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives has been published over the past decade. To date, however, little if any of this research has looked at consumer reaction to such information communicated via the medium of advertising, despite {{the increasing use of}} such corporate societal advertising appeals. While scepticism is a common cognitive response toward advertising, how scepticism toward non-economic corporate image claims might be promoted or inhibited through <b>message</b> <b>elements</b> has not been the focus of research attention. This thesis seeks to address this knowledge gap by investigating the impact of two diagnostic <b>message</b> <b>elements</b> on scepticism toward specific CSR claims. This study examines whether consumer scepticism toward the advertising of CSR claims can be influenced by altering the diagnosticity of social topic information and CSR commitment message dimensions. Two key research questions are addressed: does the provision of more social topic information encourage consumers toward less CSR advertising claim scepticism?, and does more specific information about a firm’s CSR commitment, expressing both its history and actual achievements, and their impacts, inhibit CSR advertising claim scepticism? In order to investigate these two research questions, an experimental approach was used to allow the manipulation of <b>message</b> <b>elements</b> and the testing of cause and effect. Data received via an online panel of a cross-section of 417 Australian consumers were analysed, and the hypotheses specified in study were tested using analysis of variance and covariance techniques. Results from this research suggest that increased information about the social topic related to the domain of the firm’s CSR initiatives does not significantly influence the level of scepticism toward CSR advertising claims, but information specificity about the firm’s CSR commitment does. These results are impacted by the consumer’s level of scepticism toward advertising in general, attitude toward the notion of corporate social responsibility, and attitude toward the social topic. The findings of this thesis provide evidence that consumers have the ability to deal with larger cognitive loads, created by information about specific impacts of firms’ CSR programs, and that such diagnostic information is useful in reducing scepticism responses to CSR messages. These responses are important, as they form the foundation of subsequent attitudinal and belief structures so critical for influencing consumer behaviour. The theoretical contributions of this study include: (1) situating the role of social topic information, considered a critical element of advertising campaigns in social marketing, in CSR advertising situations; (2) implicating an organisation’s CSR history and CSR and impacts as important diagnostic <b>elements</b> in CSR <b>message</b> claims; and (3) defending the ability of consumers to adequately discriminate between cognitively demanding informational inputs when evaluating CSR advertising claims. Given increasing demand from consumers to learn about firms’ CSR efforts, and firms’ increasing willingness to respond to these information demands with CSR-based advertising campaigns, this study also offers guidance for marketing communication managers charged with developing corporate image based on CSR-based brand claims. Limitations and directions for future research are also discussed...|$|R

The transition from thought to speech occurs incrementally, with cascading planning at subsequent levels of production. In this article, we aim to specify the mecha-nisms that support incremental message preparation. We con-trast two hypotheses about the mechanisms responsible for incorporating message-level information into a linguistic plan.

By contrast, on theContinuous Incrementality view, messages can be continually prepared and updated throughout the production process, allowing for fluent produc-tion even if new information {{is added to the}} message while speaking is underway. Testing these hypotheses, eye-tracked speakers in two experiments produced unscripted, conjoined noun phrases with modifiers.
