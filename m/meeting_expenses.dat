40|$|Working-age {{adults with}} disabilities in the US are {{more than twice as}} likely to live in poverty as those without disabilities; poverty rates are greater among {{non-working}} people with disabilities compared to those who work. Poverty-associated stress compounds the challenges faced daily by people living with disability. We examined satisfaction with finances, worries about meeting monthly expenses, and overall life satisfaction among working and non-working adults with disabilities using a 2010 Massachusetts Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) follow-up survey of working-age adults with disabilities (n= 882). The MA BRFSS Disability and Employment Follow-Up Survey gathered information on work participation, work-related barriers and multiple dimensions of economic wellbeing among people with disabilities. Thirty-seven percent of survey respondents with disabilities reported currently working. Logistic regression analyses showed that, controlling for demographic variables (age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status and education), health status, need for personal or routine care, and insurance status, working respondents were significantly more likely to report satisfaction with finances (OR= 1. 99, 95 % CI= 1. 07 - 3. 72) and significantly less likely to report being worried about <b>meeting</b> <b>expenses</b> (OR= 0. 37, 95 % CI= 0. 19 - 0. 68) than non-working respondents. Having private vs. public insurance was also significantly associated with satisfaction with finances; poorer health and the need for personal or routine care were significantly associated with worrying about <b>meeting</b> <b>expenses.</b> Employment was not significantly related to overall life satisfaction. Employment contributes to enhanced economic well-being and decreased financial worries among people with disabilities. Implications of finding for services for people with disabilities will be discussed. Presented at the American Public Health Association (APHA) 141 st Annual Meeting and Exposition...|$|E
40|$|Working {{with a local}} reentry organization, Labyrinth Outreach Services to Women, {{the purpose}} of this study was to gather {{information}} about opportunities and barriers related to two aspects of their program: employment services and establishment of a microbusiness. Information was obtained through a 22 -item questionnaire given to a sample of local businesses, key informant interviews, and secondary data analysis. Thirty-nine businesses in the Bloomington-Normal area responded to the questionnaire via on-line and paper survey methods, nine face-to-face interviews were conducted, along with three case studies of similar reentry microbusiness programs and a review of current literature. Stigmas of formerly incarcerated women, such as being unmotivated, irresponsible, disobedient, and violent were found to be major barriers to hiring. Significant facilitators identified for increased consideration for employment were: having support of a job coach, professionalism, expressing passion for the job, and seeking jobs with low customer contact. Successful microbusinesses within similar reentry organizations involved realistic expectations, client control over business operations, local community involvement, practice of a holistic approach, insurance of high product quality, and a focus on multiple products. Major barriers identified were obtaining start-up capital and revenue not <b>meeting</b> <b>expenses.</b> The most appropriate structure was found to be a social enterprise, which focuses more on non-monetary benefits for the employees rather than a profit focus of a traditional microbusiness. Recommendations based on the findings were made to the client...|$|E

This {{is an open}} access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ([URL] {{guidelines}} differ slightly on the recommendations for treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients, and {{although there are some}} undisputed recommendations, there is still debate regarding the management of COPD. One of the hindrances to deciding which therapeutic approach to choose is late diagnosis or misdiagnosis of COPD. After a proper diagnosis is achieved and severity assessed, the choice between a stepwise or "hit hard" approach has to be made. For GOLD A patients the stepwise approach is recommended, whilst for B, C and D patients this remains debatable. Moreover, in patients for whom inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended, a step-up or "hit hard" approach with triple therapy will depend on the patient's characteristics and, for patients who are being over-treated with ICS, ICS withdrawal should be performed, in order to optimize therapy and reduce excessive medications. This paper discusses and proposes stepwise, "hit hard", step-up and ICS withdrawal therapeutic approaches for COPD patients based on their GOLD group. We conclude that all approaches have benefits, and only a careful patient selection will determine which approach is better, and which patients will benefit the most from each approach.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} issues and {{presents}} changes in practices {{relating to the}} new working as realized in the developing e-working world. The paper begins by reviewing my own experience. This is expressed as anecdote from my diary. Following this, the downside of e-work is argued to be characterized by atomization and fragmentation and is depicted under four headings: being an e-worker, engaging with work as an e-worker, contextualizing experience as an e-worker, and managing self and work as an e-worker. This section {{is followed by a}} brief review of how this downside has been achieved. The paper then goes on to discuss two models for developing the e-work process beyond the current debacle. The first model is one based on conventional practices and is concentrated on relieving the pressure. This conventional approach is also referred to as the provision for [...] . model. The model deals with providing technologies and inducements and <b>meeting</b> <b>expenses</b> of e-workers as fragmented elements of the workforce. It is a patchwork quilt of piecemeal planning. The second model, arising from the research behind the paper, involves thinking again–Where might we be? The process develops an invitation to join [...] . model, focusing on relationships. The paper goes on to describe a process for developing a systemic approach to e-work and non-e-work for large organizations and a means for applying the systemic development of e-work in full, and not just gesture.

40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} design process for {{incorporating}} data quality requirements into database schemas that {{is rooted in}} goal-oriented requirements analysis techniques, developed in the Requirement Engineering community over last 15 years. Goal-oriented approaches (i) offer a body of notations, techniques and processes for modeling, analyzing and operationalizing quality requirements; (ii) support representation and evaluation of alternatives in goal fulfillment; and (iii) provide automated reasoning tools for various analysis and design tasks. This paper extends existing proposals for addressing data/information quality issues during database requirements analysis and design in two ways. First, we consider {{a broader range of}} quality assurance data requirements, which can be classified as restrictive, descriptive, supportive and reflective. Second, we offer a systematic way to operationalize high-level, abstract quality goals into operational, concrete quality assurance data requirements plus standard operating procedures, based on a risk-based analysis. In an earlier paper, we presented a goal-oriented conceptual database design approach, focusing on deriving an ordinary conceptual schema from application-specific goals. In this paper, we take the next step to incorporate quality goals into the design process. The proposed quality design process is illustrated step-by-step using a <b>meeting</b> <b>expense</b> database example. We also show how this process fits into the overall goal-oriented conceptual database design approach to offer an integrated framework for analyzing both application-specific and quality assurance data requirements...|$|R
