40|$|How can a {{religion}} be rational and scientific? While formulating my research question {{and preparing for}} my fieldwork among Spiritists in Brazil, that was a recurring question for me. My concern had historical reasons. If for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> evolutionary thought religion and science were understood to be competitors, {{in the twentieth century}} anthropologists abandoned, for the most part, the idea that religion would be the forerunner of science, a sort of primitive science. Religion was now relegated to a different domain of reality, a matter of inner experience and symbolic meanings. On the other hand, Spiritism takes most of its inspiration from the positivism of Auguste Comte. In this context, Spiritism would be part of the third and last stage of social development proposed by Comte, the positive state, that in which science would be able to explain everything through observation and experimentation. Thus, while it is certainly true that Spiritism is an attempt to carry on this project in the realm of what was traditionally seen as miraculous and unexplainable, it is also the case that these phenomena became more and more excluded from the scope o...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{will explore}} how writers of nineteenth-century Irish horror fiction, namely {{short stories and}} novels, used their works to express the social, cultural, and {{political}} events of the period. My thesis will employ a New Historicist approach to discuss the effects of colonialism on the writings, as well as archetypal criticism to analyse the mythic origins of the relevant metaphors. The structuralism of Tzvetan Todorov {{will be used to}} discuss the notion of the works' appeal as supernatural or possibly realistic works. The theory of Mikhail Bakhtin is used to discuss the writers' linguistic choices because such theory focuses on how language can lead to conflicts amongst social groups. The introduction is followed by Chapter One, "Ireland as England's Fantasy. " This chapter discusses Ireland's literary stereotype as a fantasyland. The chapter also gives an overview of Ireland's history of occupation and then contrasts the bucolic, magical Ireland of fiction and the bleak social conditions of <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> Ireland. Chapter Two, "Mythic Origins", analyses the use of myth in nineteenth-century horror stories. The chapter discusses the merging of Christianity and Celtic myth; I then discuss the early Irish belief in evil spirits in myths that eventually inspired horror literature. Chapter Three, "Church versus Big House, Unionist versus Nationalist," analyses how the conflicts of Church/Irish Catholicism vs. Big House/Anglo-Irish landlordism, proBritish Unionist vs. pro-Irish Nationalist are manifested in the tales. In this chapter, I argue that many Anglo-Irish writers present stern anti-Catholic attitudes, while both Anglo-Irish and Catholic writers use the genre as political propaganda. Yet the authors tend to display Home Rule or anti-Home Rule attitudes rather than religious loyalties in their stories. The final chapter of the thesis, "A Heteroglossia of British and Irish Linguistic and Literary Forms," deals with the use of language and national literary styles in Irish literature of this period. I discuss Bakhtin's notion of heteroglossia and its applications to the Irish novel; such a discussion because nineteenth-century Ireland was linguistically Balkanised, with Irish Gaelic, Hibemo-English, and British English all in use. This chapter is followed by a conclusion. EnglishM. Lit. et Phil. (English...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an examination}} of nineteenth-century British elegiac poetry. It focuses on poems written by both Romantic and Victorian poets—William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Clare, Lord Alfred Tennyson, Emily Brontë, James Thomson (B. V.), Thomas Hardy—and argues that <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> British poetry is elegiac, even when the poems are not strictly elegies by form. The last four decades of critical discussions of the elegy and elegiac writing have tended to focus almost exclusively on the psychological interpretations of the written word {{within the confines of}} the conventions of the genre. Throughout this period of stagnation, students and scholars of the elegiac vein have by and large been spoon-fed with this mainly Freudian theoretical bent which has been spearheaded by the psychoanalytic critic Peter M. Sacks. In an attempt to construct an alternative critical perspective that detracts from this psychoanalytic methodology, I explore varying attitudes to loss that elicit elegiac responses in the form of elegiac impulses. ^ My dissertation also works to bridge the conventional divide between the Romantic and Victorian eras which too often results in oversimplifications. I believe it is essential to see not only the ruptures, but also the continuities of the elegiac traditions throughout the nineteenth century. The unique differences between the two eras are certain and well documented. However, little has been said about the textual, thematic, and stylistic value of elegiac poems written throughout the century in question. I argue further that there is a long-neglected need for a distinct delineation of the intrinsic characteristics of nineteenth-century elegiac poetry through a number of specific paradigms. At this juncture, I divide nineteenth-century elegiac poetry into two main conceptual categories: sense of loss and elegiac response, where the former derives from and operates upon the paradigms of either physical death or the idea of death (i. e. perceptual death), while the latter works through the paradigm of either silence or tautology and circularity. In the final analysis, the nineteenth-century poet 2 ̆ 7 s inherent preoccupation with absence and the void and his/her response to loss becomes manifest in the form of elegiac impulses, and ultimately creates its distinctive watermark that is visible to the discerning eye by virtue of its tautological and circuitous pattern. ...|$|E

40|$|In this century, mass-producing {{manufacturing}} corporations {{turning out}} standardized products in bulk {{are the leading}} industrial form. So dominant in the modern era, these companies have also come to signify <b>much</b> <b>of</b> our <b>nineteenth-century</b> industrial history. While mass production certainly deserves its biographers, {{the sheer volume of}} this literature has blocked many from perceiving the full variety of production practices which propelled and sustained the industrializing nation. This dissertation summary examines an ignored segment <b>of</b> the <b>nineteenth-century</b> economy- the capital equipment builders- and it describes how operations in this sector diverged greatly from the mass producing paradigm. 2 I define capital equipment as those mechanismsold to secondary firms for their use in the final production of goods or delivery of services. Examining this sector through a case study of the Baldwin Locomotive Works, I argue that capital equipment builders pursued a distinctive businesstrategy of related policies in product innovation, management, production, and labor relations. This multi-faceted strategy arose from challenges particular to the capital equipment sector, and it clearly distinguishes capital equipment builders from American System machinery manufacturers. Once examined and acknowledged, these distinguishing attributes of the sector will substantially revise nineteenth-century business...|$|R
50|$|This {{created the}} fellow servant rule. In {{the years and}} decades that followed, courts in Massachusetts and {{elsewhere}} in the United States developed a panoply of doctrines that made it exceedingly difficult for industrial workers to go to law for insurance against the risks of their work. Employees were said to assume the ordinary risks inherent in the workplace. And where an employee's own negligence (no matter how slight) contributed to his injury, he was barred from recovering damages, even from a negligent employer. The contributory fault doctrine connected the law of work risks to a <b>much</b> broader array <b>of</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> legal rules that limited the law's risk-spreading capacity. People entering onto someone else's land were owed only a limited duty of care, and sometimes no duty of care at all.|$|R

We read A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man that year, and it had a big effect on me, for reasons that seem quite amusing to me now.

They demarcate the visible and tangible presence of both the law and state-sanctioned justice in the Irish urban landscape. Laws passed by the Irish Parliament, and after its abolition in 1800, by Westminster, were enforced in assize courthouses by travelling judges on established ‘circuits’, visiting each county town or city twice a year – {{in the spring and}} summer. These judges travelled with great splendour through the countryside, and were welcomed by each high sheriff at the county border and escorted with military pageantry, ritual, and procession to the county towns. Assize courthouses, then, were temporary pauses in a near-continuous flow of judicial displays of power and authority, emanating from the superior courts in Dublin to the provincial urban nuclei. Persons accused of serious crimes, arrested and imprisoned, had to wait in some cases many months for the next assizes: those arrested, for example, in September, had to languish in gaol till the following March for the spring assizes. They would then be tried and if found guilty immediately given their punishments – often transportation or hanging – unless pardoned. In times of acute agrarian unrest or rebellion, as marked so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> early <b>nineteenth-century</b> Ireland, assizes could be extraordinarily busy occasions with, by modern standards, exceptionally brief trials. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> this was also true in mainland Britain: what made Ireland unique in this period was the contested nature of government itself, and in particular the validity of the country’s status within the United Kingdom.

40|$|There was a methodological {{revolution}} in the mathematics of the nineteenth century, and philosophers have, for the most part, failed to notice. 2 My objective in this chapter is to convince you of this, and further to convince you of the following points. The philosophy of mathematics has been informed by an inaccurately narrow picture {{of the emergence of}} rigour and logical foundations in the nineteenth century. This blinkered vision encourages a picture of philosophical and logical foundations as essentially disengaged from ongoing mathematical practice. Frege is a telling example: we have misunderstood <b>much</b> <b>of</b> what Frege was trying to do, and missed the intended significance <b>of</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> what he wrote, because our received stories underestimate the complexity <b>of</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> mathematics and mislocate Frege’s work within that context. Given Frege’s perceived status as a paradigmatic analytic philosopher, this mislocation translates into an unduly narrow vision of the relation between mathematics and philosophy. This chapter surveys one part of a larger project that takes Frege as a benchmark to fix some of the broader interest and philosophical significance <b>of</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> developments.
