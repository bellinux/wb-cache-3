5|$|Alternatively, prey animals {{might be}} {{sufficiently}} gregarious to form clusters tight enough {{to enhance the}} warning signal. If the species was already unpalatable, predators <b>might</b> <b>learn</b> to avoid the cluster, protecting gregarious individuals with the new aposematic trait. Gregariousness would assist predators to learn to avoid unpalatable, gregarious prey. Aposematism could also be favoured in dense populations even if these are not gregarious.|$|E

Williams suspected a deal, and said something to Ike, who was fearful that other Cowboys <b>might</b> <b>learn</b> of his double-cross. Ike now began to threaten Wyatt and Doc Holliday (who had learned of the deal) for apparently revealing Ike's willingness to help arrest his friends.|$|E

5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program <b>might</b> <b>learn</b> so much information.|$|E
5|$|I hope I {{have not}} exaggerated {{in talking about}} Liszt; he won't make me {{anything}} wonderful, so that I can come home and set the Thames on fire—not at all, so don't expect it; but—his readings or interpretations are greater and higher than anyone else's; if I can {{spend some time with}} him and go through a good deal of music with him, I shall pick up at least a great deal of his ideas;...

25|$|An object offers as much {{resistance}} to the air as the air does to the object. You may see that the beating of its wings against the air supports a heavy eagle in the highest and rarest atmosphere, close to the sphere of elemental fire. Again you may see the air in motion over the sea, fill the swelling sails and drive heavily laden ships. From these instances, and the reasons given, a man with wings large enough and duly connected <b>might</b> <b>learn</b> to overcome {{the resistance of the}} air, and by conquering it, succeed in subjugating it and rising above it.|$|E
500|$|An odd predilection arose on {{the part}} of various republican politicians, {{including}} those [...] "of higher standing", for [...] "praising D. PedroII and the monarchy." [...] They did not desire a restoration, but believed that the Brazilian Republic <b>might</b> <b>learn</b> from the fallen regime. Thus, PedroII [...] "became, paradoxically, a model of republican ideals." [...] To these [...] "republicans, d.

500|$|The {{bishop of}} Acre was correct in {{thinking}} that a great King had conquered Persia; however [...] "King David", as it turned out, was the Tengrist Mongol ruler, Genghis Khan. His reign took the story of Prester John in a new direction. Though Genghis was at first seen as a scourge of Christianity's enemies, he proved to be tolerant of religious faiths among those subjects that did not resist the empire, {{and was the first}} East Asian ruler to invite clerics from three major religions (Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism) to a symposium so that he <b>might</b> <b>learn</b> more about their beliefs. The Mongol ruler was also reputed to have a Nestorian Christian favorite among his many wives, whom the Europeans imagined as influential in the disastrous Mongol sack of Baghdad.|$|E

500|$|Inevitably the rebels' 'king' was found. Walsingham and Capgrave {{agree that}} after Geoffrey Litster's capture, {{he was taken}} to North Walsham and was there drawn, hung and quartered. According to Capgrave's chronicle, [...] "The traitor was sought and found; he was {{captured}} and beheaded; and, divided into four parts, he was sent through the country to Norwich, Yarmouth, and Lynn, and to the site of his mansion; that rebels and insurgents against the peace <b>might</b> <b>learn</b> by what end they will finish their career". Walsingham wrote an account of the mercy shown by the bishop to Litster during his execution: [...] "After hearing his confession and absolving him by virtue of his office, he followed him to the gallows, showing, although he had overcome him, a deed of kindness and piety, for he supported his head lest it should be bruised by the ground when he was being drawn to the hanging".|$|E

2500|$|Through social learning, fishes <b>might</b> <b>learn</b> {{not only}} {{where to get}} food, but also what to get {{and how to get}} it. Hatchery-raised salmon can be taught to quickly accept novel, live prey items similar to those they will {{encounter}} once they will be released in the wild, simply by watching an experienced salmon take such prey. [...] The same is true of young perch. [...] In the laboratory, juvenile European seabass can learn to push a lever in order to obtain food just by watching experienced individuals use the lever.|$|E
2500|$|Artificial neural {{networks}} (ANNs), {{a form of}} connectionism, are computing systems inspired by the biological {{neural networks}} that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve performance) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. For example, in image recognition, they <b>might</b> <b>learn</b> to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as [...] "cat" [...] or [...] "no cat" [...] and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images. They have found most use in applications difficult to express in a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming.|$|E
2500|$|For {{several years}} in the 1930s, Siegel served as master of ceremonies for regular poetry {{readings}} that were well known for combining poetry and jazz. He was also a regular reviewer for Scribner's magazine and the New York Evening Post Literary Review. In 1938, Siegel began teaching poetry classes with the view that [...] "what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life." [...] In 1941, students in these classes asked him to give individual lessons in which they <b>might</b> <b>learn</b> about their own lives. These were the first Aesthetic Realism lessons.|$|E

He founded it during 1928, and Pius XII gave it final approval during 1950. According to the decree of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, which contains a condensed biography of Escrivá, [...] "o this mission he gave himself totally. From the beginning his was a very wide-ranging apostolate in social environments of all kinds. He worked especially among {{the poor and the}} sick languishing in the slums and hospitals of Madrid." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} reading, Moses {{instructed}} that if, after the Israelites had settled the Land of Israel, {{they decided to}} set a king over them, {{they were to be}} free to do so, taking an Israelite chosen by God. The king was not to keep many horses, marry many wives, or amass excess silver and gold. The king was to write for himself a copy of this Teaching to remain with him and read all his life, so that he <b>might</b> <b>learn</b> to revere God and faithfully observe these laws. He would thus not act haughtily toward his people nor deviate from the law, and as a consequence, he and his descendants would enjoy a long reign.

"Hence our clemency {{perceives}} {{the need}} of keeping watch over the pagans and their heathen enormities, since by natural depravity and stubborn lawlessness, they forsake the path of true religion. They disdain {{in any way to}} perform the nefarious rites of sacrifice and the false errors of their baleful superstition by some means or other in the hidden solitudes, unless their crimes are made public by the profession of their crimes to insult divine majesty and to show scorn to our age. Not the thousand terrors of laws already promulgated nor the penalty of exile pronounced upon them deter these men, whereby, if they cannot reform, at least they <b>might</b> <b>learn</b> to abstain from their mass of their crimes and the multitude of their sacrifices. But their insane audacity transgresses continually; our patience is exhausted by their wicked behavior so that if we desired to forget them, we could not disregard them." ...|$|E

40|$|Our paper {{focuses on}} firms’ {{strategic}} {{decision making in}} innovation ecosystems, highlighting how expectations regarding compatibility and value migration influence architectural design choices. Based on a study of cloud computing, we analyze how firms strategically shape the design of an emerging technology architecture.

In¬¬ particular, we highlight the processes by which interfaces are negotiated and adopted, as well as the ways in which competitive tensions are both encouraged and mitigated. This case contrasts with existing literature that assumes competing variants that are selected over time. Instead, industry participants <b>might,</b> <b>learning</b> from historical events, attempt to pre-empt these dynamics through collaboration and interest alignment of the various stakeholders...|$|R
