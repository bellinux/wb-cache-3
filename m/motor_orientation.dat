40|$|AbstractBalance deteriorates with age, and may {{eventually}} lead to falling accidents which may threaten independent living. As Taekwondo contains various highly dynamic movement patterns, taekwondo practice may sustain or improve balance. Therefore, in 24 middle-aged healthy volunteers (40 - 71 year) we investigated effects of age-adapted taekwondo training of one hour a week during one year on various balance parameters, such as: <b>motor</b> <b>orientation</b> ability (primary outcome measure), postural and static balance test, single leg stance, one leg hop test, and a questionnaire. <b>Motor</b> <b>orientation</b> ability significantly increased {{in favor of the}} antero-posterior direction with a difference of 0. 62 degrees towards anterior compared to pre-training measurement, when participants corrected the tilted platform rather towards the posterior direction; female gender being an independent outcome predictor. On postural balance measurements sway path improved in all 19 participants, with a median of 9. 3 mm/sec (range 0. 71 - 45. 86), and sway area in 15 participants with 4. 2 mm&# 178;/sec (range 17. 39 - 1. 22). Static balance improved with an average of 5. 34 seconds for the right leg, and with almost 4 seconds for the left. Median single leg stance duration increased in 17 participants with 5 seconds (range 1 - 16), and in 13 participants with 8 seconds (range 1 - 18). The average one leg hop test distance increased (not statistically significant) with 9. 5 cm. The questionnaire reported a better ‘ability to maintain balance’ in sixteen. In conclusion, our data suggest that age-adapted Taekwondo training improves various aspects of balance control in healthy people over the age of forty...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to find out whether the ability to mentally rotate {{pictures}} of animals is associated with motor ability in seven to ten year old children and adults. Results revealed significant correlations between reaction times and percentage correct responses in the mental rotation task and <b>motor</b> <b>orientation</b> errors in the children group only. In contrast, no significant correlations with motor distance errors were found. Given previous literature suggesting that movement orientation is pre-planned to a larger degree than movement distance, the results {{of the present study}} suggest that mental rotation is linked to motor control at the level of orientation programming. Moreover, the type of spatial transformation applied in both tasks may play a role, assuming that orientation programming involves the rotation of a vertical movement vector to the orientation of the target with respect to the start position. Finally, the basic ability influencing both mental rotation and orientation programming may be the accurate prediction of consequences of actions...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{functional}} electrical stimulation is to restore lost movements by excitation of motor axons inner-vating the target muscle.

In this study, the response of motor axons with different orientations to electrical stimulation was simulated. Three electrode geometries with the same area were used. The simulated axon activation was compared to experimental force measurements and showed good agreements. It is now assumed that optimal electrode geometry does strongly depend on <b>motor</b> axon <b>orientation,</b> which can vary from one subject to the other.

Methods: Participants were trained with one {{arrangement of the}} apparatus, then tested with an alternative arrangement in which either {{the positions of the}} camera, the surgeon, or the objects in the surgical field were altered. Results: Results showed that changes of either the camera 2 ̆ 7 s position or the surgeon 2 ̆ 7 s position disrupted performance. However, when the camera and surgeon positions were changed together, skilled performance was maintained. Conclusions: This suggests that skill depends on a consistent mapping between the virtual hands and eyes, but not on the particular visual or <b>motor</b> <b>orientations.</b> The results suggest that movements of the camera during surgery can disrupt coordinated action. Also, in the design of training simulators, the mapping between camera and instruments may be more important than the static appearance of the displays or the topology of the movements...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Isometric muscle contraction, where {{force is}} {{generated}} without muscle shortening, is a molecular traffic jam {{in which the}} number of actin-attached motors is maximized and all states of motor action are trapped with consequently high heterogeneity. This heterogeneity is a major limitation to deciphering myosin conformational changes in situ. METHODOLOGY: We used multivariate data analysis to group repeat segments in electron tomograms of isometrically contracting insect flight muscle, mechanically monitored, rapidly frozen, freeze substituted, and thin sectioned. Improved resolution reveals the helical arrangement of F-actin subunits in the thin filament enabling an atomic model to be built into the thin filament density independent of the myosin. Actin-myosin attachments can now be assigned as weak or strong by their <b>motor</b> domain <b>orientation</b> relative to actin. Myosin attachments were quantified everywhere along the thin filament including troponin. Strong binding myosin attachments are found on only four F-actin subunits, the "target zone", situated exactly midway between successive troponin complexes. They show an axial lever arm range of 77 °/ 12. 9 nm. The lever arm azimuthal range of strong binding attachments has a highly skewed, 127 ° range compared with X-ray crystallographic structures. Two types of weak actin attachments are described. One type, found exclusively in the target zone, appears to represent pre-working-stroke intermediates. The other, which contacts tropomyosin rather than actin, is positioned M-ward of the target zone, i. e. the position toward which thin filaments slide during shortening. CONCLUSION: We present {{a model for the}} weak to strong transition in the myosin ATPase cycle that incorporates azimuthal movements of the motor domain on actin. Stress/strain in the S 2 domain may explain azimuthal lever arm changes in the strong binding attachments.

40|$|Abstract: The system {{described}} in this paper is aiming to solve the non-optimal energy conversion in solar panels due to the angle bias of the panel surface orientation related with radiation source. Because the device is intended to function on a mobile system with unpredictable moves, the orientation algorithm works in an adaptive manner. The mathematical background of the algorithm use geometric 3 D vector objects and {{the goal is to}} maximize the light energy incident on the solar panel surface (which is equivalent with maximizing the scalar product of a pair of normal vectors). The geometric problem of orienting a plane surface in space has two degrees of freedom, so it can be mechanically resolved by two motors. These motors will individually make a rotation of the device around the two central axes of the square panel. In this regard, the orientation system receive at its input minimum three signals representing information about the spatial angle position of the power panel relative to light source and outputs two signals which controls the mechanical movement made by the motors. For simplicity reasons, the sensors used to detect the angle position are actually small solar cells identical with the cells that form the power panel, disposed beside the four sides of it and with a fixed zenith angle. This angle determines a different illumination (influenced by the position of the light source) which leads to the desired positional information. Due to the symmetry of the system and the alignment of the sensors with the rotational axes of the <b>motors,</b> the <b>orientation</b> algorithm can be made simply and independently on the two motors. With a fixed number of motor steps per algorithm cycle, the only decision that must be made is the sense of rotation. This decision is computed immediately by comparing the signals produced with the corresponding pair of sensors 1...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} project {{concentrates on the}} design and control of a two-degrees-of freedom orientation system for the photovoltaic solar panels in sunny regions which are considered very rich in solar energy. A brief background on the sun path and behavior at Latitude 31 ° as an example is discussed {{to help in the}} calculations of the needed angle ranges. The orientation system calculations are based on astronomical data and the system is assumed to be valid for any region with small modifications. The system is designed to control the Altitude angle in the vertical plane as well as the Azimuth angle in the horizontal plane of the photovoltaic panel workspace. The mechanical design is a simplified one using rotary joints and DC <b>motors.</b> This <b>orientation</b> system is expected to save more than 40 % of the total energy of the panels by keeping the panel’s face perpendicular to the sun. This percentage is assumed to be lost energy in the fixed panels. The dynamics of the panel behave like a low-pass filter which facilitates the job of the controller that behaves as a good vibration isolator passing the orientation torques at low frequency and attenuating the high frequency disturbance signals coming from the surrounding environment. Point to point open-loop control is proposed in this mechanism to ensure intermittent motion when tracking the sun. To solve the problem of cloudy days, closed-loop control can be added to the system by using solar tracking sensors and feedback control loops.

40|$|Abstract. We study {{molecular}} motor-induced microtubule self-organization in dilute and semi-dilute filament solutions. In the dilute case, {{we use a}} {{probabilistic model}} of microtubule interaction via molecular motors to investigate microtubule bundle dynamics. Microtubules are modeled as polar rods interacting through fully inelastic, binary collisions. Our model indicates that initially disordered systems of interacting rods exhibit an orientational instability resulting in spontaneous ordering. We study the existence and dynamic interaction of microtubule bundles analytically and numerically. Our results reveal a long term attraction and coalescing of bundles indicating a clear coarsening in the system; microtubule bundles concentrate into fewer orientations on a slow logarithmic time scale. In semi-dilute filament solutions, multiple motors can bind a filament to several others and, for a critical motor density, induce a transition to an ordered phase with a nonzero mean <b>orientation.</b> <b>Motors</b> attach {{to a pair of}} filaments and walk along the pair bringing them into closer alignment. We develop a spatially homogenous, mean-field theory that explicitly accounts for a force-dependent detachment rate of motors, which in turn affects the mean and the fluctuations of the net force acting on a filament.

Results: Remote assessments took slightly longer than bedside assessments (mean 9. 70 versus 6. 55 minutes, P 3 ̆c 0. 001). NIHSS scores ranged from 1 through 24. Based on weighted κ coefficients, 4 items (<b>orientation,</b> <b>motor</b> arm, motor leg, and neglect) displayed excellent agreement, 6 items (language, dysarthria, sensation, visual fields, facial palsy, and gaze) displayed good agreement, and 2 items (commands and ataxia) displayed poor agreement. Total NIHSS scores obtained by bedside and remote methods were strongly correlated (r= 0. 97, P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Conclusions: The NIH Stroke Scale remains a swift and reliable clinical instrument when used over interactive video. Application of this technology can bring stroke expertise to the bedside, regardless of patient location...|$|R
25|$|In {{a review}} article by Pierce & Buxbaum (2002), they {{concluded}} that the evidence for Hemispheric Activation Approaches, which focuses on moving the limb {{on the side of}} the neglect, has conflicting evidence in the literature. The authors note that a possible limitation in this approach is the requirement for the patients to actively move the neglected limb, which may not be possible for many patients. Constraint-Induced Therapy (CIT), appears to be an effective, long-term treatment for improving neglect in various studies. However, the use of CIT is limited to patients who have active control of wrist and hand extension. Prism Glasses, Hemispatial Glasses, and Eye-Patching have all appear to be effective in improving performance on neglect tests. Caloric Stimulation treatment appears to be effective in improving neglect; however, the effects are generally short-term. The review also suggests that Optokinetic Stimulation is effective in improving position sense, <b>motor</b> skills, body <b>orientation,</b> and perceptual neglect on a short-term basis. As with Caloric Stimulation treatment, long-term studies will be necessary to show its effectiveness. A few Trunk Rotation Therapy studies suggest its effectiveness in improving performance on neglect tests as well as the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Some less studied treatment possibilities include treatments that target Dorsal Stream of visual processing, Mental Imagery Training, and Neck Vibration Therapy. Trunk rotation therapies aimed at improving postural disorders and balance deficits in patients with unilateral neglect, have demonstrated optimistic results in regaining voluntary trunk control when using specific postural rehabilitative devices. One such device is the Bon Saint Côme apparatus, which uses spatial exploratory tasks in combination with auditory and visual feedback mechanisms to develop trunk control. The Bon Saint Côme device has been shown to be effective with hemiplegic subjects due to the combination of trunk stability exercises, along with the cognitive requirements needed to perform the postural tasks.|$|R

Actual problems of sports training {{for a long time}} is no longer in its infancy, but has evolved into an independent science. Anticipating the possibility of dealing with, the teacher relies on modern methods of morphological and functional studies, creates a model of the possible development of the individual with the hope for a successful future in sports specialization. The problem of improving the system of sports orientation currently found great suppon from various specialists as {{we have in this country}} and abroad. Despite the available data, the problem of orientation involved in sports especially in basketball is constantly in the search stage, improvement and further development. Orientation engaged in basketball is closely linked to current issues in the task of optimizing the process of preparing students to improve organizational forms of work, {{methods of teaching}} and training. The seventies marked the development speed of research theory and practice sports orientation in our country. which has led to the emergence of a large number of papers devoted to this topic. This trend is fully shared and foreign experts. Of particular relevance was the issue of early detection abilities of the students, as the growth and development lead to the identification of a sports personality begin to show more noticeable tendency to certain types of <b>motor</b> activity. Rational <b>orientation</b> allows you to create favorable conditions for full disclosure of the potential and improve them. Objective evaluation of the individual characteristics engaged in basketball demanded comprehensive research as there is no single criterion sports fitness. Even athletic performance can not be decisive in the early orientation involved in sports, especially if you do not complete the formation of the body. Separately considered morphological, functional and biomechanical, pedagogical, psychological indicators can not be the basis of sports orientation. Only a comprehensive approach to identify tendencies in view of genetic traits and abilities - the key to the effective implementation of the orientation of children, teenagers and students for sports. ? ?????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????? ???????? ? ?????????? ????????? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ??????????...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{researcher}} {{encountered the}} following problems while teaching braille IWSic notation to blind learners at the Pioneer School in Worcester: • Young learners {{learning to read}} braille IWSic notation with the piano as mediwn appeared to struggle technically. For example, blind children experienced difficulty finding the correct keys over seven octaves; they had generally weak posture; they {{had to learn to}} play one part with one hand while the other hand would read; they had to memorise the music for each clef individually and then combine them cognitively; they had to memorise the soprano, alto, tenor and bass parts of a piece; they often experienced discouragement because of the very slow progress they made compared with their sighted peers. • Although learners seemed to find the recorder technically more manageable, currently available braille recorder tutors proved to be inadequate. This inadequacy was a result of the tutors having been designed for the sighted child. The researcher thus set out to design a more appropriate approach than is currently available for teaching braille music notation to the blind, with the recorder as medium. The research method was qualitative and included a literature survey which covered the following unique needs of the blind learner: • psychological • emotional and social • concept development • <b>motor</b> skills (<b>orientation,</b> laterality, posture, coordination) • tactile perception • creativity and self expression The qualitative research also included video observation of a series ofiodividual and group lessons. The lesson material emerged from a programme designed by the researcher and was based on the literatme study. An observation panel. together with the researcher, evaluated the lessons on predetenDned coded assessment criteria 'The lessons and progrannne were adapted according to feedback from the lessons. The qualitative research includes interviews with five blind learners and six teachers of braille music notation. The interviews were designed to gather information on how blind learners can more appropriately be taught the braille music code. The unique needs of blind learners, in particular those concerning orientation and perceptual awareness, are considered in this alternative approach for teaching braille music notation to blind learners. 'The alternative programme is skills based and can be used convElliently in conlunetion with the Outcomes- Based Education (OBE) modeLAFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die navorser het die volgende probleme ondervind tydens baar onderrig van braille musieknotasie aan blinde leerders by Pionierskool in Worcester: • Dit wil voorkom asofjong leerders wat braille musieknotasie moet aanleer met die klavier as medium, tegniese probleme ondervind. Blinde kinders het dit byvoorbeeld moeilik gevind om die korrekte toetse oor sewe oktawe te vind; oor die algemeen was hulle houding swak; hulle moes leer om een stemparty met een hand te lees terwyl die ander hand gespeel het; hulle moes die musiek vir elke sleutelteken apart memoriseer en die stemme kognitiefbymekaar sit; hulle moes die sopraan, alt. tenoor en bas stempartye van 'n stuk memoriseer, hulle is baie keer moedeloos, weens hulle stadige vordering, in vergelyking met hulle siende portuurgroep. • A 1 hoewel dit gelyk het asof leerders die bioldIuit tegnies meer hanteerbaar gevind het, blyk huidige beskikbare braille bloldluit handleidings nie geskik te wees nie. Hierdie ontoereikendheid is as gevolg van die feit dat die handleidings vir die siende kind ontwerp IS. Derhalwe het die navorser gepoog om 'n meer toeganklike benadering te ontwikkel as wat tans beskikbaar is vir die onderrig van braille misieknotasie aan die blinde, met die bioldIuit as medium. Die ondersoekmetode was kwalitatief van aard en het onder andere 'n literatuuroorsig ingesluit wat die volgende unieke behoeftes van die blinde leerder ingesluit het: • siellnmdig • emosioneel en sosiaal • konsep ontwikkeling • motoriese vaardighede (oriëntasie, lateraliteit, houding, koOrdinasie) • gevoelswaarnemin...|$|R
