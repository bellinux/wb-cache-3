Furthermore, {{the use of}} alternatives to conventional water supply such as effluent reuse, rainwater harvesting and greywater use are also being encouraged through state-based rebates and the national not-for-profit Smart WaterMark label. Some water businesses in Australia have opted for restrictions on water use to conserve water supplies and minimise capital expenditure. A series of restriction levels, depending on remaining storage capacity in reservoirs, can curb the <b>maximum</b> <b>daily</b> <b>consumption</b> during drought periods.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a new {{stochastic}} optimization model. named Optimization Modelling for Gas Seller Second Stochastic Version (OMoGaS- 2 SV). to assist companies dealing with gas retail commercialization.

Temperature influences gas consumption of small consumers and is modelled by a mean reverting process. Oil prices and exchange rates influence the energy-related indices to which sell and purchase prices are related. Forward curves of these are analyzed by a vector autoregressive model while exchange rates are modelled by a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model. The profit function depends on the number of contracts with the final consumers, the typology of such consumers, the cost supported to meet the final demand and penalties for <b>daily</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>consumption</b> exceeding <b>daily</b> <b>maximum</b> capacity.

30|$|The {{difference}} between the previous ways of sizing of the water supply systems using the critical period method (CPM) is that instead of one critical period which relates to the <b>maximum</b> <b>daily</b> <b>consumption</b> of water, the CPM considers three critical periods. In the case of using PV energy for urban water supply system (UWSS), these critical periods are: critical period for sizing the subsystem PV (PV generator and inverter) t_Pel(i)^*, critical period for sizing the subsystem PS (pumping station) t_PS(i)^* and critical period for sizing the subsystem W (water reservoir) t_W(i)^* (Ðurin 2014). This provides security and reliability of the operation of each subsystem, since the sizing is performed {{with respect to the}} critical period/periods of each subsystem. In so doing, CPM produces operating integrity and technological reliability of such type of the UWSS. In other words, if critical period(s), i.e., day (days), for every subsystem are satisfied with regards to the required power of PV system, the pump station capacity and power, and water reservoir volume, will also be satisfied in all other days in the years. As a matter of fact, there will be surplus of the produced energy, but this comes in favor with providing the technologic reliability of the system.|$|E

The current study examined patterns of CED consumption among youth {{and young adults}} in Canada, using data from a national online survey conducted in October 2014. Data from a non-probability sample of 2040 respondents aged 12 – 24 from a consumer panel was weighted to national proportions; measures of CED consumption were estimated, including prevalence, excessive daily consumption, and context for use (locations and reasons). Separate logistic regression models for two outcomes, past-week consumption and “ever” exceeding two energy drinks in a day (as per common guidance), were conducted to examine associations with demographic variables (sex, age, geographic region, race/ethnicity, and language). Overall, 73. 6 % of respondents reported “ever” consuming energy drinks; 15. 6 % had done so {{in the past week}}. Any consumption of energy drinks in the past week was more prevalent among males, Aboriginal respondents (vs. white only or mixed/other), and residents of British Columbia. Among “ever-consumers,” 16. 0 % reported ever consuming more than two energy drinks in a day. Exceeding two in a day was more prevalent among older respondents (young adults aged 18 – 24), aboriginal respondents (vs. white only), and British Columbia residents. While the majority of youth and young adults had consumed energy drinks, about half were “experimental” consumers (i. e., consumed ≤ 5 drinks in their lifetime).

40|$|In the limnetic {{zones of}} small, highly {{productive}} reservoirs, young-of-year (YOY) gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) or threadfin shad (D. petenense) (henceforth, shad) often attain high densities during spring. Environmental factors facilitating early {{growth and survival}} of shad plus potential interspecific competition for zooplankton may reduce growth and survival of YOY bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), another common species in reservoirs. We hypothesized that fewer YOY bluegill moving from the limnetic zone to the littoral zone in late spring probably slows or prevents the ontogenetic switch to piscivory by YOY largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), reducing their oversummer growth, overwinter survival, and hence recruitment to their second year. To determine whether shad and bluegill abundances indeed vary inversely in reservoirs, we quantified densities of YOY shad and bluegill in four reservoirs across several years (1987 – 1994; N = 22 reservoir-years). To assess how YOY bluegill abundance influenced the ontogenetic dietary switch to fish by largemouth bass, we conducted experiments with differing levels of realism and control (4 -m 2 littoral cages, 4. 5 -m 2 outdoor pools, and 0. 33 -m 2 laboratory aquaria). In reservoirs, peak YOY bluegill density declined weakly in the limnetic zone but strongly in the littoral zone when peak limnetic YOY Dorosoma spp. exceeded 10 individuals/m 3. In pools and aquaria, largemouth bass grew more rapidly at ≥ 3 than at zero bluegill per largemouth bass. Using known temperatures and largemouth bass growth in a bioenergetics model, we discovered that YOY largemouth bass in pools and aquaria ate ≤ 65 % of their <b>maximum</b> <b>daily</b> <b>consumption</b> potential (in grams of wet mass) at ≥ 6 bluegill per largemouth bass. In cages, largemouth bass consumed only 40 % of their maximum and grew less at bluegill abundances {{similar to those in}} pools and aquaria, probably because dense vegetation and depletion of bluegill inhibited predatory success. In reservoirs with abundant shad, reduced littoral bluegill density likely compromises first-year growth and recruitment of largemouth bass. However, variable abiotic and biotic factors may modify YOY bluegill abundance and hence invalidate our predictions for largemouth bass recruitment success. To better predict fish community structure and develop management actions for reservoir ecosystems, multi-scale experimentation should be combined with whole-system manipulations (e. g., via adaptive management) to bound these variable interactions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Effective demand-side energy {{efficiency}} policies {{are needed to}} reduce residential electricity consumption and its harmful effects on the environment. The first step to devise such polices is to quantify the potential for {{energy efficiency}} by analyzing the factors that impact consumption. This paper proposes a novel approach to analyze large data sets of residential electricity consumption to derive insights for policy making and energy efficiency programming. In this method, underlying behavioral determinants that impact residential electricity consumption are identified using Factor Analysis. A distinction is made between long-term and short-term determinants of consumption by developing separate models for <b>daily</b> <b>maximum</b> and <b>daily</b> minimum <b>consumption</b> and analyzing their differences. Finally, the set of determinants are ranked by their impact on electricity consumption, using a stepwise regression model. This approach is then applied on a large data set of smart meter data and household information as a case example. The results of the models show that weather, location, floor area, and number of refrigerators are the most significant determinants of daily minimum (or idle) electricity consumption in residential buildings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background When {{calculating the}} number of deaths {{attributable}} to alcohol consumption (i. e., {{the number of}} deaths that would not have occurred if everyone was a lifetime abstainer), alcohol consumption is most often modelled using a capped exposure distribution so that the <b>maximum</b> average <b>daily</b> <b>consumption</b> is 150 grams of pure alcohol. However, the effect of capping the exposure distribution on the estimated number of alcohol-attributable deaths has yet to be systematically evaluated. Thus, the aim {{of this article is to}} estimate the number of alcohol-attributable deaths by means of a capped and an uncapped gamma distribution and capped and uncapped relative risk functions using data from the European Union (EU) for 2004. Methods Sex- and disease-specific alcohol relative risks were obtained from the ongoing Global Burden of Disease, Comparative Risk Assessment Study. Adult per capita consumption estimates were obtained from the Global Information System on Alcohol and Health. Data on the prevalence of current drinkers, former drinkers, and lifetime abstainers by sex and age were obtained from various population surveys. Alcohol-attributable deaths were calculated using Alcohol-Attributable Fractions that were calculated using capped (at 150 grams of alcohol) and uncapped alcohol consumption distributions and capped and uncapped relative risk functions. Results Alcohol-attributable mortality in the EU may have been underestimated by 25. 5 % for men and 8. 0 % for women when using the capped alcohol consumption distribution and relative risk functions, amounting to the potential underestimation of over 23, 000 and 1, 100 deaths in 2004 in men and women respectively. Capping of the relative risk functions leads to an estimated 9, 994 and 468 fewer deaths for men and for women respectively when using an uncapped gamma distribution to model alcohol consumption, accounting for slightly less than half of the potential underestimation. Conclusions Although the distribution of drinkers in the population and the exact shape of the relative risk functions at large average <b>daily</b> alcohol <b>consumption</b> levels are not known, the findings of our study stress the importance of conducting further research to focus on exposure and risk in very heavy drinkers. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to model, based on the overall {{distribution}} of extreme values, the probability of occurrence of a particular level of annual <b>maximum</b> <b>daily</b> rainfall in three Brazilian regions (Midwest, Southeast and South) and study their behavior over the past 71 years. The parameters of the general distribution of extreme values were estimated by the maximum likelihood method. The Mann–Kendall test showed that there is a positive trend in the annual <b>maximum</b> <b>daily</b> rainfall data series. The non-stationarity was rejected by the augmented Dickey–Fuller test supporting the use of the density function of extreme value distribution to describe the values of the occurrence of annual <b>maximum</b> <b>daily</b> rainfall. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov/Lilliefors goodness-of-fit test showed the good fit of the studied variable to the probability distribution function. The Midwest region has a return period of more frequent annual <b>maximum</b> <b>daily</b> rainfall below 300 mm in comparison with other regions. There is a clear change in the behavior of this extreme event in the Southern region. According to the literature, in past decades annual <b>maximum</b> <b>daily</b> rainfall of 248 mm has been estimated for a return period of 100 years for the state of Santa Catarina-South region, while the results found with the current series, annual <b>maximum</b> <b>daily</b> rainfall of 250 mm was estimated for a return period of 10 years. Extreme annual <b>maximum</b> <b>daily</b> rainfalls for return periods smaller were also found in other regions...|$|R

No study has examined the association of <b>daily</b> ready-made meal <b>consumption</b> with diet quality or health-related outcomes. The present study aimed to investigate the association between self-reported ready-made meal consumption and diet quality, as measured by compliance with dietary recommendations and {{with a set of}} adiposity measures, in a nationally representative sample of 1352 subjects, aged 18 – 69 years, participating in the nationwide population-based ORISCAV-LUX (Observation of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Luxembourg) survey. The <b>daily</b> <b>consumption</b> of ready-made meals was calculated as follows: frequency of consumption £ portion size £ number of portions consumed. The sum of the <b>daily</b> <b>consumption</b> values of the eleven pre-packaged dishes included in the FFQ represented the total <b>daily</b> <b>consumption</b> of ready-made meals (g/d) for each participant.
