5|$|The {{public image}} of homosexuals changed with liberalized social {{attitudes of the}} late 1960s. In 1969, the Stonewall riots {{occurred}} in New York City, marking {{the start of the}} gay rights movement. Though gay life in Miami was intensely closeted, and bars were subject to frequent raids, Christ Metropolitan Community Church—a congregation for gay and lesbian Christians in Miami—was founded in 1970 as a religious outlet, attracting hundreds of parishioners. The 1972 Democratic National Convention was held in Miami, featuring, for the first time, a public speech about the rights of gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> by openly gay San Francisco political activist Jim Foster. Jack Campbell opened the Miami branch of Club Baths in 1974. When it was raided, he made sure that all charges against those arrested were dropped, filed a lawsuit against the Miami Police Department prohibiting further harassment, and received a formal apology from the police. Even the depiction of gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> in the local newspaper had changed to that of a silent, oppressed minority. By 1977, Miami was one of nearly 40cities in the U.S. that had passed ordinances outlawing discrimination against gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to see themselves as part of the same community with gay men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> united to work together on the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Lesbian {{consciousness}} {{began in}} Nicaragua in 1986, when the Sandinista National Liberation Front expelled gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> from its midst. State persecution prevented {{the formation of}} associations until AIDS became a concern, when educational efforts forced sexual minorities to band together. The first lesbian organization was Nosotras, founded in 1989. An effort to promote visibility from 1991 to 1992 provoked the government to declare homosexuality illegal in 1994, effectively ending the movement, until 2004, when Grupo Safo– Grupo de Mujeres Lesbianas de Nicaragua was created, four years before homosexuality became legal again.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine psychology graduate students' attitudes toward gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women. It was hypothesized that the following variables would predict participants' attitudes toward gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women: participant gender, amount of client contact with gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women, <b>and</b> gender role attitudes. Additionally, a measure of social desirability was included to investigate the validity of responses. Data were analyzed by conducting an independent t-test, a correlated t-test, and hierarchical multiple regression. Results indicated that gay men were viewed more negatively than were lesbian women. As expected, participants' gender role attitudes significantly predicted their attitudes toward gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women. Contrary to predicted outcomes, results indicated that neither participant gender nor client contact predicted attitudes toward homosexuality. Finally, results suggested that participants were not engaging in socially desirable responding. Implications of this study for research, theory, and practice are discussed.

40|$|The Catholic Church tenets are in dissonance with American Counseling Association (ACA) ethical {{guidelines}} regarding same-sex sexual orientation. While homosexuality {{was removed}} from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual II as a disorder, the Catholic Church upholds same-sex sexual acts as grave depravity and disordered. Catholic counselors may face the dilemma of adhering to their religious tenets or their professional guidelines in working with gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women clients. Previous research has indicated that values conflicts between religious beliefs and ACA Ethical Codes on same-sex sexual orientation have resulted in legal issues due to counselors refusing therapeutic relationships or providing substandard therapy to gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women clients. An extensive literature review revealed no studies that exclusively focused on the disconnect between the Catholic Church 2 ̆ 7 s tenets and the ACA Ethical Codes. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore the experience of values conflicts of Catholic counselors while working with gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women clients. Interpretative phenomenological analysis guided the analysis of data collected from interviews with 9 Catholic counselor participants. Six major themes emerged from the analysis: challenges, comfortable, identification with Catholic faith, personal view of Catholic position, referral, and multicultural training. The study provides insight to counselor educators and supervisors in improving multicultural competence of counselors and students. The study is an important contribution to the existing literature and would enhance social change initiatives through support and acceptance of gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women, which the counseling profession advocates...|$|R

The city is also known as a popular vacation spot for gays and lesbians, with many LGBT or LGBT-friendly hotels and guesthouses. Fort Lauderdale hosts the Stonewall Library & Archives, and in neighboring Wilton Manors there is a large LGBT community center, the Pride Center, and the World AIDS Museum and Educational Center.|$|E
5|$|Australia allows gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> {{to serve}} openly. Openly {{gay and lesbian}} {{personnel}} were banned from the ADF until November 1992 when the Australian Government decided to remove this prohibition. The heads of the services and most military personnel opposed this change at the time, and it caused considerable public debate. Opponents of lifting the ban on gay and lesbian personnel argued that doing so would greatly harm the ADF's cohesiveness and cause large numbers of resignations. This did not eventuate, and the reform caused relatively few problems. A 2000 study found that lifting the ban on gay service {{did not have any}} negative effects on the ADF's morale, effectiveness or recruitment and retention, and may have led to increased productivity and improved working environments.|$|E
5|$|Gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> came {{together}} to work in grassroots political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named Save Our Children staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in Dade County, Florida. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the Briggs Initiative, designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated. Reaction {{to the influence of}} Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess whether children’s attitudes toward gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women differ in {{relation}} to their ethnic backgrounds and whether ethnic differences are a result of perceived differential gender socialization practices. Data were collected from children in eight Dutch elementary schools by means of a paper-and-pencil questionnaire administered in the classroom. All children (mean age 11. 47; N = 229) lived in the Netherlands; 50. 2 % had non-Western and 49. 8 % Western ethnic backgrounds. Children with non-Western ethnic backgrounds reported more negative attitudes toward gays <b>and</b> <b>lesbians.</b> These children perceived more parental pressure to behave in accordance with their gender and showed more negative attitudes toward gender-nonconforming behavior by peers. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that cultural differences in attitudes toward gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women are partly mediated by differentially perceived parental pressure to behave in accordance with their gender...|$|R
5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 {{was used to}} justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear {{of the opposite sex}} caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians,</b> but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{rebellion}} at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and Adam Nagourney write, a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, {{they had an}} advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night {{the lives of millions}} of gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians,</b> and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.|$|E

5|$|Homosexuals in Miami {{were not}} well-connected or {{experienced}} enough {{to combat the}} coalition led by Bryant, so they invited two political organizers to the city: Ethan Geto from New York City and Jim Foster from San Francisco, {{both of whom were}} gay. Foster and Geto faced battles not only with the Save Our Children campaign, but the disjointed and often closeted gay community in Miami. When organizations outside of Florida promoted boycotting Florida orange juice, Jack Campbell disagreed, worried that an economic backlash in the state would work against local gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians.</b> Ruth Shack saw the issue simply, as one of civil rights; Geto and Foster agreed. Bob Kunst soon broke away from the campaign to promote the orange juice boycott, and his views were often printed in the newspapers to Geto's alarm.|$|E
5|$|Several {{popularity}} polls {{conducted over}} the past decade indicate that Freddie Mercury's reputation may, in fact, have been enhanced since his death. For instance, in a 2002 vote to determine who the UK public considers the greatest British people in history, Mercury was ranked 58 in the list of the 100 Greatest Britons, broadcast by the BBC. He was further listed at the 52nd spot in a 2007 Japanese national survey of the 100 most influential heroes. Despite {{the fact that he had}} been criticised by gay activists for hiding his HIV status, author Paul Russell included Mercury in his book The Gay 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Gay <b>Men</b> <b>and</b> <b>Lesbians,</b> Past and Present. In 2008 Rolling Stone ranked Mercury 18 on its list of the Top 100 Singers Of All Time. Mercury was voted the greatest male singer in MTV's 22 Greatest Voices in Music. In 2011 a Rolling Stone readers' pick placed Mercury in second place of the magazine's Best Lead Singers of All Time.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two studies designed to further validate the construct of modern homonegativity {{as measured by the}} Modern Homonegativity Scale (MHS). Similar to the concepts of modern racism and modern sexism, modern homonegativity rests upon three core assumptions: (1) gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women are making illegitimate (or unnecessary) demands for changes in the status quo; (2) discrimination against homosexual <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women is a thing of the past; <b>and</b> (3) gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women exaggerate the importance of their sexual preference and, in so doing, prevent themselves from assimilating into mainstream culture. The MHS was created to measure contemporary negative attitudes toward gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women (i. e., attitudes that are not based on traditional or moral objections to homosexuality). The scale contains two parallel forms: one for gay <b>men</b> (MHS-G) <b>and</b> one for <b>lesbian</b> women (MHS-L). Using Canadian participants (N = 374), results of Study 1 indicate that the parallel versions of the MHS are reliable, unidimensional, factorially, and conceptually distinct from a measure of old-fashioned homonegativity as measured by the Attitudes Toward <b>Lesbian</b> <b>and</b> Gay Men Scale and a relatively new measure of homonegativity entitled Modern Homophobia. As well, modern homonegativity correlated in the hypothesized direction with the motivation to control prejudiced reactions. Finally, results of one-way ANOVAs indicated that individuals who reported having gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women as acquaintances and close friends evidenced significantly lower levels of modern homonegativity than did individuals who reported no contact experience. Study 2 was designed to examine the psychometric properties of the MHS from a cross-cultural vantage. Specifically, the psychometric properties of the MHS were investigated using a sample of American participants (N = 608). Results of this study confirmed the unidimensionality of the MHS-G, and its conceptual distinctiveness from other measures of homonegativity (the ATLG and "Modern" Homophobia scales). Also, modern homonegativity correlated in the hypothesized direction with political conservatism, religious self-schema, neosexism, and concern about acting prejudiced. Similar to Study 1, results of one-way ANOVAs confirmed that individuals who reported having both gay <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women as acquaintances and close friends evidenced lower levels of modern homonegativity when compared with individuals who reported not having gay or lesbian acquaintances or close friends. Finally, the metric invariance of the MHS-G and MHS-L factor loadings were tested. With the exception of four items on the MHS-G, the metric invariance of the parallel versions of the MHS was confirmed. In summary, the studies outlined in this thesis strengthen the argument that a new form of homonegativity exists. Further, the MHS possesses superior psychometric properties and will prove useful when used to measure negative attitudes toward homosexual <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women in college and university settings. As an adjunct to the implications of the research, future directions are outlined...|$|R

40|$|It is an {{established}} fact that gay men {{earn less than}} other <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women earn more than other women. In this paper we study whether differences in competitive preferences, which have emerged as a likely determinant of labour market differences between <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women, can provide a plausible explanation. We conduct an experiment on a Dutch online survey panel to measure the competitiveness of gay, <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> straight panel members. For differences in competitiveness to partially explain sexual orientation differences in earnings, gay men {{would need to be}} less competitive than other <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> women more competitive than other women. Our findings confirm this competitiveness hypothesis for men, but not for women. Gay men compete less than other men, while lesbian women compete as much as other women.

Differences in competitiveness can account for {{a significant portion of the}} gay earnings penalty, but cannot explain the lesbian premium...|$|R
