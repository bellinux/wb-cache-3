5|$|According to the {{economic}} theory behind congestion pricing, {{the objective of this}} policy is the use of the price mechanism to make users <b>more</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> costs that they impose upon one another when consuming during the peak demand, and that they should pay for the additional congestion they create, thus encouraging the redistribution of the demand in space or in time, or shifting it to the consumption of a substitute public good; for example, switching from private transport to public transport.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequence}} of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German. Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities {{that occur in the}} standard English spellings of commonly used words. Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English. Making primary school teachers <b>more</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark Zero is a first-person shooter where players {{control the}} player {{character}} mostly from a first-person perspective. The combat features mechanics {{such as an}} evasive dodge roll and a cover {{system in which the}} gameplay switches to a third-person perspective, allowing the player to strategically aim without taking damage and be <b>more</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surroundings. Players cannot jump but have the ability to automatically climb obstacles {{as long as they can}} reasonably reach them. It is also possible to climb ladders. By doing so, the camera shifts into a third-person perspective. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. The health can recharge a bit if the player steps out of the line of fire for a few seconds, but it may not necessarily refill completely depending on how much damage the player took.|$|E

5|$|The 'Best' and 'Back' {{service was}} highly criticized by analysts and customers. Braathens SAFE {{had a strong}} image, and unlike SAS, that was branded as 'The Businessman's Airline', Braathens SAFE {{was seen as the}} people's airline. It also drew {{goodwill}} from being Norwegian-owned, and that it displayed the Flag of Norway on the tailplane. Prior to the rebranding, no airline in Norway had ever operated a two-class service on domestic flights—including SAS. Professor of Sociology Per Morten Schiefloe commented that the introduction of segregation of passengers offended passengers. Customers who previously had been paying full price, became <b>more</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> savings on using 'Back' tickets. At the same time, people who wanted to travel with discounted tickets felt that they got better service and were not treated as second-rate customers with SAS. This caused Braathens to lose customers at both ends. The rebranding itself not only cost money to initiate, but also increased operating expenses, because cabin crew needed to move the curtain depending on the number of passengers on each class. Planes were sometimes delayed for hours, particularly {{in the beginning of the}} service, due to the increased work load on the handling and cabin crew.|$|E
25|$|The rise in {{popularity}} of ethical consumerism {{over the last}} two decades can be linked to the rise of CSR.

25|$|In {{the fourth}} series, Private S. Baldrick's {{intelligence}} has slightly risen again {{enough that he}} desires a rise in social status. He attempts to gain social status in the third episode by marrying General Melchett. This of course does not succeed.

Together with her students and colleagues, Ho spent several periods {{living and working in}} nearby villages, as part of the ongoing student movement to alleviate rural poverty. While the student leaders were preoccupied with organizing the peasants into a political group in their search for democracy, Ho became <b>more</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emotional world of the women and children there.|$|E

25|$|As chutney music's {{popularity}} grows, {{people are}} becoming <b>more</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixture of cultures present in Trinidad and Tobago. Many of the chutney artists {{that are known}} within West Indian culture are from Trinidad. Sundar Popo was a pioneer of chutney music, famous for first blending chutney with calypso and soca and increasing {{the popularity of the}} genre. The instruments used in chutney were those that were approved for women to play, making chutney becoming viewed as a woman's music genre. Since then, chutney has grown from a woman's genre into a leading player of the pop music scene with both men and women participating in nationwide competitions. Chutney music is a reflection on the culture of Trinidad and Tobago, its blending of Indian, Western and African elements is a representation of the backgrounds that are mixed together to form the culture of Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
25|$|Particularly {{given their}} failure to hold Quảng Trị City after {{overrunning}} and briefly occupying it in April 1967 despite committing a large force of about 2,500 men, the Communists became <b>more</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> difficulties of attacking and capturing the city. In the weeks before Tet, they had attempted to lure allied forces from the coastal lowlands to the mountains by threatening several of the Marine combat bases along Highway 9 {{in the western part}} of the province. But while the U.S. Marines had shifted some forces to the besieged Khe Sanh Combat Base, MACV commanders had reinforced eastern Quảng Trị Province in late January with the 1st Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division. The existence of major American units near Quảng Trị City came as a shock, but with little time to make adjustments, the Communists decided to move forward with their original plan.|$|E
25|$|The main {{distinction}} between the La Lagunila baratillo and others is that a section of it has developed into an antiques market. This section is centered on Comonfort Street and attracts collectors and tourists from both Mexico and abroad. It is {{the best known of}} a number of antiques markets including Mercardo Cuauhtemoc, Mercado de Alvaro Obregon and Plaza del Angel in Mexico City along with Callejón del Sapo in Puebla and El Baratillo in Guadalajara. The antiques market {{is one of the most}} traditional in Mexico City as interaction between seller and buyer is intense and personal. Good bargainers can get discounts of as much as thirty percent. As part of selling, many vendors will relate stories about the pieces, which may or may not be true. The market has attracted some foreign buyers and sellers and with the Internet and other sources of information, most sellers are <b>more</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prices their items can fetch. In the past, this antiques market was known as cheap, but that is not true anymore.|$|E

The film's title came from a June 2009 interview with Molly Melching, founder of Tostan, an organization dedicated to human rights education operating in ten African countries.
