In general with BWS, survey respondents are shown a subset of items from a master list and are asked to indicate {{the best and worst}} items (or most and least important, or most and least appealing, etc.). The task is repeated a number of times, varying the particular subset of items in a systematic way, typically according to a statistical design. Analysis is typically conducted, as with DCEs more generally, assuming that respondents makes choices according to a random utility <b>model</b> (<b>RUM).</b> RUMs assume that an estimate of how much a respondent prefers item A over item B is provided by how often item A is chosen over item B in repeated choices. Thus, choice frequencies estimate the utilities on the relevant latent scale. BWS essentially aims to provide more choice information {{at the lower end of}} this scale without having to ask additional questions that are specific to lower ranked items.|$|E

40|$|Research PaperFisher {{behavior}} {{can be divided into}} choices made in the short term (i. e. tactics) and choices made in the long-mid term (i. e. strategies). Random utility <b>modeling</b> (<b>RUM)</b> is well suited for the empirical analysis of these issues. In this paper, RUM is applied to a number of EU fisheries in order to assess the key factors affecting short-term discrete choices with regard to choice of fishing location in European fisheries. In the analyses presented, components of the choice relating to gear, species targeted and the fishing area/ground selected are explored. Four differently structured case studies are considered to develop the discussion: Basque trawlers, English beam trawlers, French trawlers and Danish gillnetters. In the case of the Basque trawlers, a multinomial logit formulation proved suitable to analyze the fishing area (including gear used and target species). For the English beam trawl fleet and French trawlers conditional logit is used, and for the Danish gillnetters a nested logit formulation is developed. Specific attention is given to the identification of explanatory variables incorporated in these analyses.
