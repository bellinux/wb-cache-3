2500|$|McLure {{says that}} he was {{inspired}} to write the play by a vision that came to him of a poster advertising a boxing match between Jean Harlow and Billy the Kid. Before he began to write, {{he went to the}} printer that created boxing posters in San Francisco, and had the poster of his vision printed up. Then he says [...] "I put the poster up on fences, windows, and in liquor stores where boxing posters would be, and put one up behind <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room I worked in at the time, which overlooked the bridge and the ocean. I could feel the presence of Billy the Kid and Jean Harlow broadcasting from the beautiful poster to {{the back of my head}} out towards the ocean. They began enacting the play and I began typing it up. They'd say a few pages, I just typed it. I thought it was a nature poem about mammal sexuality and mammal love. It could have been a tantric ritual." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{solve the}} problem of {{overpopulation}} in Japan, a plan was announced in Tokyo in 1935 to settle five million Japanese farmers and their families into Manchukuo between 1936 and 1956, and in the first stage of the plan 20,000Japanese families moved to Manchukuo every year, continuing until 1944, when American submarine attacks reduced the shipping available to move colonists into Manchukuo. By 1939, the total Japanese population in Manchukuo was about 837,000men, women, and children; comprising the Japanese who had been brought in as rural colonists plus the Japanese who had come to Manchukuo to work as civil servants, businessmen, and for the South Manchurian Railroad company, which was the largest corporation in Asia at the time, together with their families. To provide farmland for the Japanese settlers, the ethnic Chinese and ethnic Korean farmers already living on the land were evicted {{to make way for the}} colonists. Those farmers who resisted eviction to make way for the Japanese settlers were used by the Kwantung Army for bayonet practice. Furthermore, Manchukuo was meant to be the industrial powerhouse of the Japanese empire, and right from the start, the Japanese started to build factories and mines on a vast scale while the Chinese workers were ruthlessly exploited. The American historian Mark Driscoll described the economic system introduced by Nobusuke Kishi, Manchukuo's Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce between 1935-1939 and a future prime minister of Japan, as a “necropolitical” system where the Chinese workers were literally treated as dehumanized cogs within a vast industrial machine. Behr commented that Puyi knew from his talks in Tianjin with General Kenji Doihara and General Seishirō Itagaki that he was dealing with [...] "ruthless men and that this might be the regime to expect". Puyi later recalled that: [...] "I had put <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tiger's mouth" [...] by going to Manchuria in 1931.|$|E

60|$|I was an idiot, but I {{could not}} help it. I buried <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sofa cushion, and sobbed. Everything seemed {{fighting}} against me, to make my purpose more difficult.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said I, [...] "and I {{might have}} gone down cellar and put <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold-air box of the furnace. But there wouldn't have been much fun in that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My reasons {{would take}} me a week to explain, and I doubt whether I have them very clear <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first place there is that {{difficulty}} about the babies. Most of them must get married you know." ...|$|R
60|$|Going {{out with}} <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, and my senses {{in the seventh}} heaven, I jostled an elderly gentleman passing before the garden gate. I turned round to apologize; it was my brother in office, the estimable Treasurer of the Duskydale Institute.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Makely {{asked if}} we were going to church. She said she was driving that way, and would be glad to drop us.

60|$|For a {{while there}} was a lull; the subject of {{smallpox}} was taboo, and nobody heard much about it beyond vague and indefinite rumours.

60|$|I made haste, hereupon, to nod <b>my</b> <b>head</b> twice--once <b>in</b> <b>the</b> negative, meaning thereby that I {{would prefer}} not taking the other bottle at present--and once <b>in</b> <b>the</b> affirmative, {{intending}} thus to imply that I was sober and had positively come to my senses.

60|$|I might indeed turn pale, for I {{was very}} much {{surprised}} at first, believing that this was, as it often happens in such cases, only a project to drop me, and break off an amour which he had now carried on so long; and a thousand thoughts whirled about <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> few moments while I was kept in suspense, for they were but a few. I say, I was indeed surprised, and might, perhaps, look pale, but I was not in any danger of fainting that I knew of.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If you're {{in such a}} {{state of}} mind as that,' he grumbled, but in the same subdued key, 'why don't you make over your property? Buy an annuity cheap, and make your life {{interesting}} to yourself and everybody else that watches the speculation. But no, that wouldn't suit YOU. That would be natural conduct to your own son, and you like to be unnatural, and to keep him out of his rights. Why, I should be ashamed of myself if I was you, and glad to hide <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> what you may call it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are foolish," [...] she declared, {{with a note}} of {{irritability}} in her tone.

I, too, want to understand--to walk with <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light. Love is a great thing, and happiness a joy. Let me go my own way towards them. We may meet--who can tell? But I will not be fettered, even though you would make the chains of roses. Listen." ...|$|E
60|$|I was stooping {{to examine}} the more recent signs, when a sharp snort made me raise <b>my</b> <b>head</b> quickly. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> path before me stood a doe, all a-quiver, her feet still braced from the suddenness with which she had stopped at sight of an unknown object {{blocking}} the path ahead. Behind her two other deer checked themselves and stood like statues, unable to see, but obeying their leader promptly.|$|R
