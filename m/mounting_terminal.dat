40|$|Although feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) is {{a common}} and potent {{pathogen}} of the domestic cat, neoplastic disease is a relatively rare outcome of the virus-host interaction and generally occurs after a long latent period (Hardy et al. 1976; Jarrett 1984). For these reasons, it has been customary to classify FeLV as a chronic leukaemogenic retrovirus and to place the acute transforming C-type retroviruses in a separate subclass. In our view, this classification has been unhelpful since it obscures the fact that acute transforming retroviruses invariably arise from the chronic leukaemogenic variety. Moreover, there is <b>mounting</b> evidence that <b>terminal</b> diseases which develop in FeLV-infected cats are induced by variant genomes that arise de novo. In this review, we discuss the origins of FeLV variants and briefly consider their roles in disease...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{extending}} the design technique {{presented by the}} authors in a previous work, we propose the study of a new family of polygonal patch antennas for portable devices of communication systems. Such antennas are suitable to be <b>mounted</b> in modern <b>terminals,</b> enabling wideband/multi-frequency operation and new multimedia features. The desired electromagnetic behaviour of the proposed radiators is obtained by adding either shorting posts, properly located between the polygonal patch and the ground plane, or circular slots, drilled at the appropriate position on the patch surface. Circular slots are also useful to easily accommodate a photo-camera in the terminal, in order to enable multimedia services and video calls. Some practical layouts of polygonal patch antennas to be used in: a) modern PDAs and Smart Phones integrating cellular phone operation and wireless functionalities; b) UMTS terminals integrating also GSM functionalities, are, finally, presented. The effectiveness of the proposed designs is confirmed through proper full-wave numerical simulations. 1...|$|R
