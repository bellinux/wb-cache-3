5|$|At {{medium to}} close range, an adult red-throated loon in either {{breeding}} or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised. However, in certain light conditions, {{at certain times}} in its moulting cycle, or at greater distances, it may be mistaken for another species—most commonly the black-throated loon, but also occasionally the great crested grebe. It shows <b>more</b> <b>white</b> {{on the head and}} neck than does the black-throated loon, and—provided it is not sitting low in the water—tends to show <b>more</b> <b>white</b> on the flanks as well. If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a patch on the rear flank (thus resembling the pattern of the black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the black-throated.|$|E
5|$|In {{support of}} the album, Kyuss went on tour with such {{established}} groups as Faith No <b>More,</b> <b>White</b> Zombie, and Danzig. In early 1993, the band was chosen by Metallica to be an opening act for nine shows in Australia. After their first show with Metallica, the group was only allowed to use half the P.A. system for the other eight concerts.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, European-Americans {{settled in}} the area that is now Omak and built houses and inaugurated mining, logging and {{agricultural}} activities. As <b>more</b> <b>white</b> settlers arrived, a dispute about land ownership arose between them and the Native Americans.|$|E

5|$|Six {{subspecies}} {{are currently}} recognised, characterised principally by differences {{in size and}} plumage. There is a steady change to the birds' morphology and size the further south they are encountered, with lighter and more greyish plumage, larger body size, and a shorter bill. Southerly populations also show <b>more</b> <b>white</b> plumage in the tail, with less whiteness on the wing.|$|E
5|$|After {{the work}} {{stoppage}} at pit number six, <b>more</b> <b>white</b> miners assembled near the town. They marched to Rock Springs {{by way of}} the railroad, carrying firearms. At about 10:00a.m., the bell in the Knights of Labor meeting hall tolled, and the miners inside the building joined the already large group. There were white miners who opted to go to saloons instead of joining the gathering mob, but by 2:00p.m., the saloons and grocers were persuaded by a Union Pacific official to close.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{declaration}} of war against Mexico in May 1845 and especially after the claim by the US of southwest lands under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, US military incursions into Yavapai territory greatly increased. After gold was discovered in California in 1849, <b>more</b> <b>White</b> emigrants passed through Yavapai territory than ever had before. Despite the thousands of emigrants passing through their territory, the Yavapai avoided contact with Whites.|$|E
25|$|In {{studies in}} the 1980s and 1990s, blacks said {{they were willing to}} live in neighborhoods with 50/50 ethnic composition. Whites were also willing to live in {{integrated}} neighborhoods, but preferred proportions of <b>more</b> <b>whites.</b> Despite this willingness to live in integrated neighborhoods, the majority still live in largely segregated neighborhoods, which have continued to form.|$|R
5000|$|In {{regard to}} slavery, {{influential}} settler Stephen F.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the initial impact {{of rock and}} roll on {{mainstream}} American culture waned as major record companies took a controlling influence and sought to market more conventionally acceptable recordings. Electric musical instruments (particularly guitars) and amplification were becoming more affordable, allowing young musicians to form small groups to perform in front of local audiences of their peers; and in some areas there was a breakdown, especially among radio audiences, of traditional black and white markets, with <b>more</b> <b>white</b> teenagers listening to and purchasing R records.|$|E
5|$|The KMSHA {{was founded}} in 1989. In 2002, a {{subsidiary}} organization, the SMHA, was formed to register horses who had <b>more</b> <b>white</b> markings than were allowed by the KMSHA. As of 2011, the KMSHA has over 3,200 members and has registered over 24,000 horses. The majority of the horses are in Kentucky, but the breed is also seen throughout the US, {{as well as in}} Canada and a small population in Europe. The KMSHA and SMHA host a joint championship show each year at the Kentucky Horse Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} is {{distinguished}} from the black-throated loon (G. arctica) and the red-throated loon (G. stellata) mainly by its larger size. It usually has a steeper forehead and a bulging forecrown, somewhat similar to the black-throated loon. Its bill is heavier and the back is paler than its hindneck. It {{is more difficult to}} separate from the yellow-billed loon, but its breeding plumage has <b>more</b> <b>white</b> markings on the neck and the squares on its shoulders are usually smaller; the non-breeding plumage has darker neck-sides contrasting more sharply with pale areas and bill colour.|$|E

5|$|The {{sideline}} 4...g5!? was {{not well}} regarded {{at the end of}} the 20th century. It weakens several squares—particularly f5 and h5—as they cannot be covered by the g-pawn any <b>more.</b> <b>White</b> can try to exploit these weaknesses with the manoeuvres Bf4–d2–c3 (pressure along the diagonal a1–h8), Ng1–e2–g3–h5 (pressure against the squares f6 and g7) and h2–h4 (to open the h-file). Nonetheless, the 4...g5 line has found new supporters in recent years thanks to black wins against both 5.Bg3 and 5.Bd2.|$|E
5|$|Variations are {{markedly}} different with each subspecies. The eastern subspecies has more distinct spots on its chest, <b>more</b> <b>white</b> along the tips and retraces and obvious wing bars. T.c. palmeri has less spotting on chest and tips and less obvious wing bars. Other examples include T.c. curvirostre possessing longer wings and a tail than T.c. oberholseri; T.c. insularum is paler with more grey than T.c. palmeri {{and has more}} visible spotting on its breast.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the move}} to the Le Méridien Piccadilly Hotel, the menu and wine list were {{expanded}} once <b>more.</b> <b>White</b> sought to have a far wider range of wine than at other three Michelin star restaurants; one example given was that while a different restaurant might have four or five bottles of Pétrus, the Oak Room list had more than 70 different vintages. There was a collection of Château d'Yquem listed over five pages going back to 1850. By November 1997, the wine cellar was valued at £1.5 million, with an average weekly taking on wine alone between £25,000 and £30,000. The menu was changed to include more table service, such as meat carvings. The other courses and side dishes were carried from the kitchen on silver platters. The idea that this would provide entertainment for all diners, {{even if they did}} not order a course with table service.|$|E

5|$|Most {{observed}} white dwarfs {{have relatively}} high surface temperatures, between 8,000K and 40,000K. A white dwarf, though, spends {{more of its}} lifetime at cooler temperatures than at hotter temperatures, so we should expect {{that there are more}} cool white dwarfs than hot white dwarfs. Once we adjust for the selection effect that hotter, more luminous white dwarfs are easier to observe, we do find that decreasing the temperature range examined results in finding <b>more</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs. This trend stops when we reach extremely cool white dwarfs; few white dwarfs are observed with surface temperatures below 4,000K, and one of the coolest so far observed, WD 0346+246, has a surface temperature of approximately 3,900K. The {{reason for this is that}} the Universe's age is finite; there has not been enough time for white dwarfs to cool below this temperature. The white dwarf luminosity function can therefore be used to find the time when stars started to form in a region; an estimate for the age of our Galactic disk found in this way is 8 billion years. A white dwarf will eventually, in many trillions of years, cool and become a non-radiating black dwarf in approximate thermal equilibrium with its surroundings and with the cosmic background radiation. No black dwarfs are thought to exist yet.|$|E
5|$|The peace did not last. Miners began {{prospecting}} {{for gold}} in the watershed, including a Bear Creek tributary called Jackson Creek, where they established a mining camp in 1851 {{at the site of}} what later became Jacksonville. Indian attacks on miners that year led to U.S. Army intervention and fighting near Table Rock between Indians and the combined forces of professional soldiers and volunteer miner militias. John P. Gaines, the new territorial governor, negotiated a new treaty with some but not all of the Indian bands, removing them from Bear Creek and other tributaries {{on the south side of}} the main stem. At about the same time, <b>more</b> <b>white</b> emigrants, including women and children, were settling in the region. By 1852, about 28donation land claims had been filed in the Rogue Valley. Further clashes in 1853 led to the Treaty with the Rogue River (1853) that established the Table Rock Indian Reservation across the river from the federal Fort Lane. As the white population increased and Indian losses of land, food sources, and personal safety mounted, bouts of violence upstream and down continued through 1854–55, culminating in the Rogue River War of 1855–56.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} attitudes toward prostate cancer, screening practices and deterrents to early detection and treatment among Black and White men 40 years and older residing in San Bernardino and Riverside, California. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire developed and pre-tested among similar participants in the study. Two hundred and fourteen men participated in the study, of which 75 % were Black and 25 % White. The majority (53 %) was between the ages of 40 - 50 years, and 74 % were married. The study found that there was very little difference in socioeconomic status between Whites and Blacks. Most (34 %) had a college degree, but <b>more</b> <b>Whites</b> (92 %) had a personal family physician than Blacks (77 %), and slightly <b>more</b> <b>Whites</b> (62 %) than Blacks (57 %) said that prostate screening was done regularly. Findings from this study should aid in the design and development of culturally appropriate programs that will detect prostate cancer in this population at an earlier stage when treatment is more successful...|$|R
