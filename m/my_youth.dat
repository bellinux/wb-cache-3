5|$|After the Second World War began, Bax {{moved to}} Sussex, taking up {{residence}} at the White Horse Hotel, Storrington, where he lived {{for the rest of}} his life. He abandoned composition and completed a book of memoirs about his early years, Farewell, <b>My</b> <b>Youth.</b> The Times found it at times waspish, at times reticent, surprising in parts, and regrettably short. Later in the war Bax was persuaded to contribute incidental music for a short film, Malta G. C.; he subsequently wrote music for David Lean's Oliver Twist (1948) and a second short film, Journey into History (1952). His other works from the period include the short Morning Song for piano and orchestra, and the Left-Hand Concertante (1949), both written for Cohen. Bax and the Poet Laureate, John Masefield, worked on a pageant, The Play of Saint George in 1947, but the project was not completed.|$|E

500|$|In 1900 Bax {{moved on}} to the Royal Academy of Music, where he {{remained}} until 1905, studying composition with Frederick Corder and piano with Tobias Matthay. Corder was a devotee of the works of Wagner, whose music was Bax's principal inspiration in his early years. He later observed, [...] "For a dozen years of <b>my</b> <b>youth</b> I wallowed in Wagner's music to the almost total exclusion – until I became aware of Richard Strauss – of any other". Bax also discovered and privately studied the works of Debussy, whose music, like that of Strauss, was frowned on by the largely conservative faculty of the Academy.|$|E

500|$|Cibber {{began his}} career as an actor at Drury Lane in 1690, and had little success for several years. [...] "The first Thing that enters into the Head of a young Actor", he wrote in his {{autobiography}} half a century later, [...] "is that of being a Hero: In this Ambition I was soon snubb'd by the Insufficiency of my Voice; to which might be added an uninform'd meagre Person... with a dismal pale Complexion. Under these Disadvantages, I had but a melancholy Prospect of ever playing a Lover with Mrs. Bracegirdle, which I had flatter'd my Hopes that <b>my</b> <b>Youth</b> might one Day have recommended me to." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{an early}} stage in his priesthood Lang decided to lead a celibate life. He had no {{objection}} to the institution of marriage, but felt that his own work would be hindered by domesticity. Years after Lang's death, his sexual orientation was questioned; [...] journalist Michael Gove and historian David Starkey suggested that Lang was a repressed homosexual. He had close friendships with colleagues such as Dick Sheppard, and with Wilfrid Parker, his one-time domestic chaplain to whom he wrote admitting his personal loneliness, and of his need for [...] "someone in daily nearness to love". He enjoyed the company of women and confessed in 1928, after {{a visit to the}} Rowntree's chocolate factory, that the sight of the girls there had [...] "stirred up all the instincts of <b>my</b> <b>youth...</b> very little subdued by the passage of years".|$|E
500|$|The {{songs of}} Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness are {{intended}} to hang together conceptually, with {{the two halves of}} the album representing day and night. Despite this, Corgan has rejected the term concept album to describe it, and it was at the time described as more [...] "loose" [...] and [...] "vague" [...] than the band's previous records. However, Billy Corgan has also said that the album is based on [...] "the human condition of mortal sorrow". Corgan aimed the album's message at people aged 14 to 24 years, hoping [...] "to sum up all the things I felt as a youth but was never able to voice articulately." [...] He summed up by stating, [...] "I'm waving goodbye to me in the rear view mirror, tying a knot around <b>my</b> <b>youth</b> and putting it under the bed." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{this period}} Mercator was {{in contact with}} the Franciscan monk Monachus who lived in the monastery of Mechelen. He was a {{controversial}} figure who, from time to time, was in conflict with the church authorities because of his humanist outlook and his break from Aristotelian views of the world: his own views of geography were based on investigation and observation. Mercator must have been impressed by Monachus, his map collection and the famous globe that he had prepared for Jean Carondelet, the principal advisor of CharlesV. The globe was constructed by the Leuven goldsmith Gaspar van der Heyden (Gaspar a Myrica c1496–c1549) with whom Mercator would be apprenticed. These encounters may well have provided the stimulus to put aside his problems with theology and commit himself to geography. Later he would say, [...] "Since <b>my</b> <b>youth,</b> geography has been for me the primary subject of study. I liked not only the description of the Earth but the structure of the whole machinery of the world." ...|$|E

I was taking German in high school—which meant that we listened to it in school. I couldn't get away from it." [...] According to Broderick, Ferris's singing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] in the shower was his idea. [...] "Although it's only because of the brilliance of John's deciding that I should sing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] on the float in the parade. I had never heard the song before. I was learning it for the parade scene. So we're doing the shower scene and I thought, 'Well, I can do a little rehearsal.' And I did something with my hair to make that Mohawk. And you know what good directors do: they say, 'Stop! Wait till we roll.' And John put that stuff in." ...|$|E

500|$|While Etty {{did have}} admirers, the patchy {{quality of his}} later work meant that he never {{acquired}} the circle of imitators and students that could have led to him being seen as {{the founder of the}} English realist movement, now considered to have begun in 1848 with the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais, two of the three founders of the Pre-Raphaelites, were heavily influenced by Etty's early works but recoiled from his later style. Holman Hunt recollected that [...] "in <b>my</b> <b>youth</b> [...] had lost the robustness he once had [...] the paintings of his advanced age cloyed the taste by their sweetness". Millais had consciously modelled his style on Etty, and his works prior to the formation of the Pre-Raphaelites are very similar in composition, but after 1848 the only similarity in style is the use of colour. As Pre-Raphaelitism waned Millais's style became more varied, and some of his later work such as The Knight Errant owes a strong debt to Etty's influence.|$|E
500|$|The trio {{were called}} to active duty in January 1942, forcing them to leave the Bruins midway through the 1941–42 season. In their final game with the Bruins, the Kraut Line {{recorded}} eight points in a dominating victory over the Montreal Canadiens. [...] Following the contest, players from both teams fêted the trio, hoisting them up on their shoulders and parading them around the ice. Bauer was overwhelmed by the moment: [...] "The ovation, {{at the height of}} <b>my</b> <b>youth,</b> sort of grabbed me." [...] Schmidt, Dumart and Bauer were the first NHL players to join the Royal Canadian Air Force, and while training in Ottawa, they joined the Ottawa RCAF Flyers of the Quebec Senior Hockey League (QSHL). The trio helped the Flyers win the Allan Cup as Canadian senior champions. Bauer was sent to Halifax to continue his training and played with the Dartmouth RCAF team in 1942–43. Bauer, who served as a radio technician, was dispatched to the United Kingdom where he, Schmidt and Dumart were members of a bomber squadron. However, he was returned to Canada in 1944 after being ruled invalid due to a bout of sciatica caused by an old hockey injury. He played with a team in Toronto until the war's conclusion.|$|E
500|$|The biographer Richard D. E. Burton {{comments}} that, in {{the late}} 1920s, Poulenc might have {{seemed to be in}} an enviable position: professionally successful and independently well-off, having inherited a substantial fortune from his father. He bought a large country house, Le Grande Coteau, at Noizay, Indre-et-Loire, [...] south-west of Paris, where he retreated to compose in peaceful surroundings. Yet he was troubled, struggling {{to come to terms with}} his sexuality, which was predominantly homosexual. His first serious affair was with the painter Richard Chanlaire, to whom he sent a copy of the Concert champêtre score inscribed, [...] "You have changed my life, you are the sunshine of my thirty years, a reason for living and working". Nevertheless, while this affair was in progress Poulenc proposed marriage to his friend Raymonde Linossier. As she was not only well aware of his homosexuality but was also romantically attached elsewhere, she refused him, and their relationship became strained. He suffered the first of many periods of depression, which affected his ability to compose, and he was devastated in January 1930 when Linossier died suddenly at the age of 32. On her death he wrote, [...] "All <b>my</b> <b>youth</b> departs with her, all that part of my life that belonged only to her. I sob... I am now twenty years older". His affair with Chanlaire petered out in 1931, though they remained lifelong friends.|$|E

500|$|Shelley's {{trips to}} Italy were {{a way for}} her to revisit {{memories}} of her dead husband, Percy Shelley, and the children they had buried there. Moskal argues that Shelley needed to [...] "expiate" [...] her survivor guilt and Dolan {{that she needed to}} recover from a damaging trauma. Shelley writes about this in Rambles, using the trope of a pilgrimage; she believes that travelling to Italy and revisiting the scenes of her youth will cure her of her depression, writing, [...] "Besides all that Rome itself affords of delightful [...] to the eye and imagination, I revisit it as the bourne of a pious pilgrimage. The treasures of <b>my</b> <b>youth</b> lie buried here." [...] Shelley's pilgrimage follows in the tradition of Chaucer as well as the nineteenth-century trend to visit spas for healing, and like most pilgrimage narratives, hers does not relate the journey home. For Shelley, ultimately the most helpful part of travelling and visiting spas was seeing the beautiful scenery. In Rambles, Shelley contends that interacting with picturesque scenery can heal the body. Both the 1840 and 1842 trips followed times of ill health for Shelley and she used them as a way to recover both emotionally and physically. She opens Rambles by describing her poor health and hoping that by travelling her [...] "mind will... renew the outworn and tattered garments in which it has long been clothed".|$|E
