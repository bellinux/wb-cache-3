But {{the bulk of the}} Nauruan population can be found living on the island of Nauru. In this they differ markedly from other Pacific Island nations where a growing proportion of the population {{is to be found in}} metropolitan countries.|$|E
25|$|The attack {{prompted}} the Government of Finland, Parliament of Finland representatives and the President of Finland Sauli Niinistö to discuss fast-tracking the intelligence bill. The bill {{was intended to}} enhance national security against serious threats, such as terrorism, with both civilian and military intelligence. New powers granted with the bill would include network traffic intelligence and intelligence gathering abroad. Prime Minister of Finland Juha Sipilä said {{on the need for}} intelligence gathering reform that it should be “obvious from a constitutional standpoint that the right to life is a <b>more</b> <b>precious</b> fundamental right than the right to privacy in light of the Turku events".|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, a {{permanent}} exhibition was opened dedicated to the imperial family. Certain elements of the Reception Room, Nicholas II's New Study and Alexandra Feodorovna's Drawing Room were recreated to provide a backdrop for exhibitions of historical costumes, weapons and objects of applied art. A portrait of Alexandra Feodorovna by Friedrich von Kaulbach was returned to its original position. Clothing worn by the last imperial family and uniforms related {{to the court of}} Tsar Nicholas II was also placed on display. Much of this clothing only survived because it had been used as packing case wadding for <b>more</b> <b>precious</b> objects when the palace was evacuated in World War II.|$|E
25|$|The art {{of writing}} Chinese {{characters}} is called Chinese calligraphy. It is usually done with ink brushes. In ancient China, Chinese calligraphy {{is one of}} the Four Arts of the Chinese Scholars. There is a minimalist set of rules of Chinese calligraphy. Every character from the Chinese scripts is built into a uniform shape by means of assigning it a geometric area in which the character must occur. Each character has a set number of brushstrokes; none must be added or taken away from the character to enhance it visually, lest the meaning be lost. Finally, strict regularity is not required, meaning the strokes may be accentuated for dramatic effect of individual style. Calligraphy was the means by which scholars could mark their thoughts and teachings for immortality, and as such, represent some of the <b>more</b> <b>precious</b> treasures that can be found from ancient China.|$|E
25|$|Calligraphic {{process is}} also {{structured}} {{in the same}} way as wéiqí. A minimalist set of rules conveys a system of incredible complexity and grandeur. Every character from the Chinese scripts is built into a uniform shape by means of assigning it a geometric area in which the character must occur. Only three basic forms are used in the creation of the character, those being square, triangle and circle. Each character has a set number of brushstrokes, none must be added or taken away from the character to enhance it visually, lest the meaning be lost.

500|$|The episode {{deals with}} the concept of realizing one's {{mortality}} and discovering that life is <b>more</b> <b>precious</b> because of it. [...] Learning that he is in fact not immortal as he once thought, Bender initially feels that living a life that is anything less than immortal is worthless. [...] He {{deals with the}} devastating news of his newfound mortality by trying to find the one person who he believes can answer his questions about the reason for his life and why he was allowed to [...] "be born" [...] only to die. [...] Though Bender cannot find the answers to his mortality, he ultimately ends up developing a new outlook on life, believing it to be <b>more</b> <b>precious</b> than it was before now that it is finite, and he resolves that life is worth living no matter how brief it is.|$|E
500|$|The {{conflict}} at Kimberley {{started on}} 14 October 1899. [...] Colonel Baden-Powell, anticipating the inevitable onset of hostilities, encouraged {{all the women}} and children to leave the town. [...] Some civilians left in a special train, escorted as far as Vryburg by an armoured train. [...] On the return journey, the armoured train was captured in the first action of the war between Kimberley and Mafeking at Kraaipan by Boers under the command of fighting general De la Rey, the hero of the western Transvaal. [...] On 12October, the Jacobsdal Commando severed the railway line at the bridge over the Modder River south of Kimberley, whereafter the Boers entrenched themselves in the hills at Spytfontein. [...] Meanwhile, the Boshof Commando severed the railway line [...] north of the town at Riverton Road, then shut off the primary water supply at Riverton on the Vaal River. [...] For the first time, water in the mines became <b>more</b> <b>precious</b> than the diamonds in them. On 14October the Boers cut the telephone line to the Cape. [...] Heliograph and dispatch riders consequently had to make hazardous journeys through Boer lines to the Orange River and then to Cape Town and Port Elizabeth. [...] On 15 October, martial law was declared in the town.|$|E

He further commended the way Beyoncé half-raps [...] "with a delicious snarl" [...] {{in the first part}} of the song. Many critics, including Una Mullalay of The Irish Times and Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune welcomed Beyoncé's rapping on [...] "Partition" [...] and compared it to the work of British recording artist M.I.A. Andrew Barker of Variety magazine highlighted that among the songs that discuss sexuality on Beyoncé, [...] "none hold a candle to the absolutely scorching 'Partition'". He also praised how Beyoncé [...] "toss off a few old-school battle rhymes" [...] with the line, [...] "I sneezed on the beat, and the beat got sicker", being a standout. Similarly, Miles Marshall Lewis of Ebony magazine noted that lines like, [...] "I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker / Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor", would make listeners smile. He praised how Beyoncé [...] "spills lyrics ... in a confident flow" [...] and concluded, [...] "As a singing rapper, she's still way <b>more</b> <b>precious</b> than ferocious." ...|$|E

500|$|By 1808 it {{was still}} {{considered}} unsafe to return to Berlin, and the royal family consequently spent the summer near Königsberg; Louise believed that the hard trials of her children's early lives {{would be good for}} them: [...] "If they had been reared in luxury and prosperity they might think that so it must always be." [...] In the winter of 1808, Tsar Alexander I invited the king and queen to St. Petersburg, where she was treated to sumptuously decorated rooms; [...] "Nothing dazzles me anymore", she exclaimed on her return to Germany. Near the birth of her youngest child Princess Louise in 1809, Louise wrote to her father, [...] "Gladly...the calamities which have befallen us have not forced their way into our wedded and home life, rather have strengthened the same, and made it even <b>more</b> <b>precious</b> to us." [...] Louise was sick for much of that year, but returned with the king to Berlin near the end of it after an absence of three years; the queen arrived in a carriage accompanied by her two daughters Charlotte and Alexandrine and younger son Charles, and was greeted by her father at Charlottenburg Palace– the residence was ransacked however, as Napoleon and his commanders had stripped its rooms of paintings, statues, manuscripts, and antiquities. Returning to a much different Prussia than she left, a preacher observed that [...] "our dear queen is far from joyful, but her seriousness has a quiet serenity... her eyes have lost their former sparkle, and one sees that they have wept much, and still weep".|$|E
500|$|John Anderson, of Variety, said [...] "to simply call it {{harrowing}} or unsparing doesn’t quite cut it," [...] having {{felt that}} the film is [...] "courageous and uncompromising, a shaken cocktail of debasement and elation, despair and hope." [...] Anderson cited Carey's performance as [...] "pitch perfect" [...] and Patton's role as Ms. Blu Rain as [...] "disarming." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly, praised Carey's performance, describing it as having been [...] "an authentically deglammed compassion" [...] and praised the film for 'capturing' [...] "how a lost girl rouses herself from the dead" [...] and for Daniels' showing [...] "unflinching courage as a filmmaker by going this deep into the pathologies that may still linger in the closets of some impoverished inner-city lives." [...] Gleiberman described the film as being a movie [...] "that makes you think, 'There {{but for the grace}} of God go I.' [...] It's a potent and moving experience, because by the end you feel you've witnessed nothing less than the birth of a soul" [...] and {{felt that the}} [...] "final scene of revelation" [...] between Sidibe's and Mo'Nique's characters was strong enough to be able to leave viewers [...] "tearful, shaken, [...] dazed with pity and terror." [...] He identifies how Daniels uses one of the rich scenes created by Fletcher to position Mo'Nique in a painful confrontation with Sidibe that results in a masterful and thought-provoking performance that delivers the final [...] "push" [...] needed by Sidibe: [...] "The <b>more</b> <b>Precious</b> tries to get away from her mother, the more she's pulled back".|$|E
500|$|The {{first group}} of people {{claiming}} to be an ambassadorial mission of Romans to China was recorded as having arrived in 166 AD by the Book of the Later Han. The embassy came to Emperor Huan of Han China from [...] "Andun" [...] ( [...] ; Emperor Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus), [...] "king of Daqin" [...] (Rome). As Antoninus Pius died in 161 AD, leaving the empire to his adoptive son Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and the envoy arrived in 166 AD, confusion remains about who sent the mission, as both emperors were named [...] "Antoninus". The Roman mission came from the south (therefore probably by sea), entering China by the frontier of Rinan or Tonkin (present-day Vietnam). It brought presents of rhinoceros horns, ivory, and tortoise shell, probably acquired in Southern Asia. The text states {{that it was the}} first time there had been direct contact between the two countries. Yule speculated that the Roman visitors must have lost their original wares due to robbery or shipwreck and used the gifts instead, prompting Chinese sources to suspect them of withholding their <b>more</b> <b>precious</b> valuables, which Yule notes was the same criticism directed at papal missionary John of Montecorvino when he arrived in China in the late 13th century AD. Historians Rafe de Crespigny, Peter Fibiger Bang, and Warwick Ball believe that this was most likely a group of Roman merchants rather than official diplomats sent by Marcus Aurelius. Crespigny stresses that the presence of this Roman embassy as well as others from Tianzhu (in northern India) and Buyeo (in Manchuria) provided much-needed prestige for Emperor Huan, as he was facing serious political troubles and fallout for the forced suicide of politician Liang Ji, who had dominated the Han government well after the death of his sister Empress Liang Na. Yule emphasised that the Roman embassy was said to come by way of Jiaozhi in northern Vietnam, the same route that Chinese sources claimed the embassies from Tianzhu (northern India) had used in 159 and 161 AD.|$|E

2500|$|Tosfos {{explains}} that {{it uses the}} example of a kohen gadol (high priest), because this statement is based on the verse, [...] "y'kara hi mipnimim" [...] (it is <b>more</b> <b>precious</b> than pearls). This is explained elsewhere in the Gemara to mean that the Torah is <b>more</b> <b>precious</b> pnimim (translated here as [...] "inside" [...] instead of as [...] "pearls"; thus that the Torah is introspectively absorbed into the person), which refers to lifnai v'lifnim (translated as [...] "the most inner of places"), that is the Holy of Holies where the kahon gadol went.|$|E
