50|$|Vuosaari {{dumping ground}} was a <b>municipal</b> <b>dumping</b> {{ground in the}} years 1966-1975 and 1979-1988. During the latter period {{it was one of}} the “big three”. The two others were the Iso-Huopalahti dumping ground and the Pasila dumping ground. The Vuosaari dumping ground is the second biggest dumping ground in the Nordic {{countries}} ever, second only to the current Ämmässuo dumping ground in Espoo, Finland. The waste taken there included domestic waste, industrial waste, and in all likelihood also hazardous waste.|$|E
40|$|Clinical waste {{management}} {{system is a}} integrated procedure for monitoring, aggregating, assorting, accumulating, transporting, and discarding of clinical waste produced by an organization such as hospitals. Clinical waste constitutes various potential health and safety risks and hazards. In addition to their virulent and lethal features, the majorly unsteady and erratic nature of clinical waste streams has increased public concern about storage, treatment, transportation and ultimate disposal. The management of clinical waste {{is still in its}} genesis all over the nation. Today as of now, there is no substantial work done on medical {{waste management}} in several hospitals of Mysore city. Now, medical wastes are just mixed up with other domestic wastes and disposed crudely in <b>municipal</b> <b>dumping</b> sites. There is a lot of disorder along with plight among the operators, generators, and the general populace about the innocuous, uncontaminated management of clinical waste. This research paper finds environmental exposure and public health impact of poor medical waste treatment and disposal in Mysore city, based on several months of survey and finally proposes recommendations to the problems identified during the survey...|$|E
40|$|For {{a couple}} of years a number of {{inhabitants}} living in the immediate vicinity of Cracow's <b>municipal</b> <b>dumping</b> ground reported symptoms which could be related to disfunction of the airways. During 2 days of hospitalization thorough medical examinations were given to 50 persons living not further than 300 meters {{from the edge of the}} dumping-ground. In frames of the study FVC, FEV 1, FEV 25 / 75, RV%TLC and Raw were measured. A significantly higher number of subjects from the vicinity of the dumping ground than from the control group suffered a chronic cough and expectorations. Significantly higher numbers of inhabitants had emphysemal changes and worse patency of central bronchi. Obtained results confirm that human lungs are not only opened widely to all kinds of toxic substances present in inhaled breath, but also it is a very sensitive and vulnerable organ, easily damaged by asorted toxins present in air in even smaller concentrations than are regarded at present as safe. It should be postulated that major dumping grounds must have reasonably wide protective zones...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The way rubbish {{is handled}} is often {{restricted}} {{by the development}} level of a country and the urban economy. Before the 1980 's, rubbish was mostly dumped and buried {{on the outskirts of}} cities in China. There was no sanitation control in the <b>municipal</b> rubbish <b>dumping</b> and burial site. Since there is neither capping {{on the top of the}} site nor means to prevent the leakage at the base of the dumping and burial site, the rubbish is in contact with the earth's surface and the leachate infiltrates through soil. At present, the Chinese government is constructing modern landfill in accordance with the international standards for sanitation landfill. <b>Municipal</b> rubbish <b>dumping</b> and burial sites will be closed and remediated. The geological environment problems of <b>municipal</b> rubbish <b>dumping</b> and burial must be studied in order to close and remediate them successfully. The rubbish dumping and burial sites and the combined relevant rubbish materials were investigated in China. The impact of leachate from rubbish dumping and burial sites on surface water, soil and rock, and groundwater water was analysed, together with gas movement and enrichment in the geological environmental. As a result, the geological environmental problems of <b>municipal</b> rubbish <b>dumping</b> and burial were understood. The study provides a basis for <b>municipal</b> rubbish <b>dumping</b> and burial site remediation in the cities of China.

This helped spur neighborhood development. By 1930, all but the Jonathan Tract (Heather Square) had been filled in. The west-central area of the neighborhood remained undeveloped until 1943.|$|R
