Zigzag and armchair types of cell arrangements are {{considered for the}} blocks; relatively thick cell walls are assumed {{to focus on the}} effect of cell wall yielding rather than cell wall deflection. For the two-scale analysis, the fully implicit homogenization scheme developed by Asada and Ohno [Asada, T., Ohno, N., 2007. Fully implicit formulation of elastoplastic homogenization problem for two-scale analysis. International Journal of Solids and Structures 44, 7261 – 7275] is rebuilt by introducing half unit cells to halve the analysis domains in unit cells. For the full-scale analysis, three cell sizes are considered. It is shown that the two-scale analysis provides no apparent dependence on the two types of cell arrangements because of their equivalence under in-plane loading, whereas the full-scale analysis reveals that the local deformation in <b>honeycomb</b> <b>blocks</b> is highly dependent on cell arrangement. Nevertheless, the two-scale analysis is found to be successful in predicting the indentation load-displacement relation and the macroscopic localization direction in <b>honeycomb</b> <b>blocks...</b>|$|R
40|$|In-plane {{uniaxial}} and equi-biaxial compression {{tests were}} conducted quasi-statically on polycarbonate circular honeycombs. While the uniaxial compression tests were easy to implement, a special test rig was designed {{to carry out the}} in-plane (x-y) equi-biaxial compression tests in a conventional universal testing machine. The deformation characteristics of a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>block</b> under uniaxial compression are quantitatively described by tracking the variations of the cells' parameters, such as the area strain and the angle of cells, during the deformation process of the honeycomb. As the distribution of the deformation within the <b>honeycomb</b> <b>block</b> under biaxial compression is much more complex, a series of color maps based on the area strain of each cell are produced to demonstrate the inhomogeneous deformation among the cells in the <b>honeycomb</b> <b>block,</b> by which the initiation of deformation inhomogeneity and its evolution in the <b>honeycomb</b> <b>block</b> are characterized. To identify the role of the friction between the honeycomb sample and the test rig, finite element analysis is conducted to simulate the collapse process of the circular honeycomb under equi-biaxial compression. Furthermore, an inhomogeneity index, 1; h, is defined {{as a function of the}} overall compression of a sample to quantify the severity of the deformation inhomogeneity of the honeycomb; this index facilitates quantitative comparisons among the results under various loading conditions. It is found that the value of 1; h of a sample is closely related to some internal factors, such as the localization band of deformation and the deformation pattern of cells. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} {{combining}} metallic honeycomb with folded thin metallic sheets (corrugation) {{to construct a}} novel core type for lightweight sandwich structures is proposed. The honeycomb–corrugation hybrid core is manufactured by filling the interstices of aluminum corrugations with precision-cut trapezoidal aluminum <b>honeycomb</b> <b>blocks,</b> bonded together using epoxy glue. The performance of such hybrid-cored sandwich panels subjected to out-of-plane compression, transverse shear, and three-point bending is investigated, both experimentally and numerically. The strength and energy absorption of the sandwich are dramatically enhanced, compared to those of a sandwich with either empty corrugation or honeycomb core. The enhancement is induced by the beneficial interaction effects of <b>honeycomb</b> <b>blocks</b> and folded panels on improved buckling resistance as well as altered crushing modes at large plastic deformation. The present approach provides an effective method to further improve the mechanical properties of conventional honeycomb-cored sandwich constructions with low relative densities...|$|R

It is revealed that the early response of these packed cells {{is dominated by the}} collision between the striker and the impinged end of the packed cells.

40|$|Strain {{localization}} in {{a finite}} <b>block</b> of circular <b>honeycomb</b> is studied using a phenomenological approach {{based on the}} structural response of the honeycombs, The deformation modes characteristic for a circular honeycomb material under in-plane biaxial compression are identified from the experiments and described analytically for compression strains up to about 15 %. It is concluded that the particular deformation modes depend on the local strain field, and modes with different dominant strains can co-exist inside a finite block subjected to equi-biaxial remote strains. The relationships between the local strain components {{for the development of}} these modes are determined. Using the proposed approach to the strain localization, it is shown that for equal remote strains applied to a finite <b>block</b> of <b>honeycombs,</b> larger remote stresses would occur when assuming homogeneous deformation inside the block in comparison to the calculated stress when the strain inhomogeneity takes place. A comparison between the theoretical and experimental results is made for a finite <b>honeycomb</b> <b>block</b> under quasi-static equi-biaxial compression. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Automotive safety {{regulations}} vary {{in different parts}} of the world. Dynamic side impact regulations, for example, are different than the ones in Europe. United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the European Union (EU) have each produced their own distinct testing procedures such as different deformable barriers, impact configurations and anthropomorphic test devices (dummies). Although both test procedures have the same final objective, estimate occupant responses in side impact, they differ greatly in execution. One of the main differences in testing is the Moving Deformable Barrier (MDB) used. The US MDB is designed to represent an average midsize vehicle in the US market, while the European MDB represents a mid size vehicle in Europe. The objective of this paper is to develop a finite element model representing the US deformable barrier for use in side impact simulations. Special emphasis is made on using the various available material models in LS-DYNA and the correct adhesive properties to predict the correct behavior of the honeycomb material. These models are validated to available full-scale tests. As known by many researchers, the main difficulty of MDB modeling is the prediction of the barrier complex failure modes. In side impact tests, the severe shear deformation of the honeycomb material, full densification of barrier edge, rupture of aluminum cover sheets, and tearing of <b>honeycomb</b> <b>blocks</b> are often observed. This complex pattern of honeycomb material failure mode makes it difficult to predict.

40|$|In this study, the {{application}} of two closely coupled Diesel Particle Filters (DPFs), composed of an assistant DPF and a <b>main</b> standard <b>honeycomb</b> DPF, was investigated. A series of tests were carried out on a light-duty common-rail Euro 4 diesel engine and the emissions were measured and compared with those when a standard DOC+DPF system {{was used for the}} after-treatment. Replacing the DOC with an assisting DPF (ADPF) showed significant advantages in the reduction of particles, which had a direct impact in reducing the soot loading rate of the main DPF by up to 30 %. Its oxidation characteristics not only showed equivalent exhaust-conversion efficiency, which concern the regulated gaseous emissions (CO and HC) under most engine conditions, but also continuously regenerated the soot it trapped. The impacts on the particle size and distributions were investigated, based on the new regulations on particle number limits; as well as the increased back pressure which is an unavoidable compromise. The overall performance of this DPF+DPF strategy showed great potential to be adopted in the future, Not only can this cope with tighter emissions regulations but it also has great cost benefits as main DPF's size and weight can be reduced. It also encourages more options for other cheaper materials as less soot is collected. Copyright © 2010 SAE International...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{mechanical}} properties of structured reactors/heat exchangers, for high temperature heat storage via the cobalt oxide cyclic redox scheme. Two different structures (i. e. <b>honeycomb</b> and perforated <b>block)</b> and two different compositions (i. e. 100 % cobalt oxide and 90 wt% cobalt oxide – 10 wt% aluminium oxide) were evaluated. During thermal cycling {{in the range of}} 800 - 1000 oC, different loads were applied to the sampleswhile monitoring their length variation. The integrity of the samples was assessed after every cycle. It was found that mechanical strength was substantially improvedupon addition of 10 wt% aluminium oxide. The cobalt oxide/alumina composite presented lower maximal expansion during cycling and exhibited higher integrity, already after one thermal cycle. Another important result is that, for both the honeycomb and the perforated block, the load decreases the over-all sample net expansion. Moreover, the perforated block exhibited lower expansion and better mechanical strength as compared to the honeycomb. Due to the better chemical performance expected to be achieved by the honeycomb structure, a compromise between these two structureshas to be chosen (e. g. honeycomb structure with thicker walls). The results are used for building a thermochemical storage system prototype, implemented {{for the first time in}} an existing concentrated solar power facility (STJ) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{particulate}} matter {{is probably one}} of the most critical issues of the diesel engine emissions. After years of research, people begin to understand it further, with respect to its impact on the environment and human health, its formation mechanism inside and outside the diesel engine, and most importantly, the methods to control its formation. This study has focused on the {{particulate matter}} emission control in diesel engines. It started with the application of two closely coupled Diesel Particle Filters (DPFs), consisting of an assistant DPF and a <b>main</b> standard <b>honeycomb</b> DPF, to replace the standard Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) + DPF system, commonly applied on diesel engines these days. This new after-treatment system showed a great potential to be adopted in the future, not only for the tighter emission regulations but also for the great cost reduction of the total after-treatment system by the reduction of the main DPF’s size and weight and more options of other cheaper materials. The back pressure problem revealed in the experiment was then studied through a one dimensional model simulation and its influence to the engine performance was discussed. Fuel injection parameters which are related with the engine performance and emissions were also investigated in the study. After careful calibrations, a single injection induced Partially Charge Compression Ignition (PCCI) combustion was achieved, in which mode, NOx and smoke emissions were reduced by more than 80 % compared with using the normal multiple injections. Following that, the non-volatile particulate emissions under the pilot injection’s impacts were studied and the key parameters of the pilot control such as fuel quantity and injection timing were examined. The particulate number concentrations and size distributions were investigated under different engine operation conditions and the results illustrated how a pilot injection alongside a main injection could influence particulates and what these effects were closely related to. The research continued with the investigation of bio-fuels on the particle emission reduction, when 10 % alternative diesel fuel blends (Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME) and Gas-to-Liquid (GTL)) were used. They indicated that without any modification to the engine, adding selected alternative fuels, even at a low percentage, could result in a noticeable reduction of the particle numbers, both in the total and the non-volatile parts; however, the number of nucleation mode particles could increase in certain cases. It was also revealed that the engine suffered very high numbers of the nucleation mode particulates during warming up. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|In this study, surface {{modification}} of both organic and inorganic substrates (in terms of cellulose and silica nanoparticles, respectively) has been explored using surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP). The desire to modify bio-based materials {{to fit into}} new application areas {{and the need for}} bio-based materials with improved material properties is steadily increasing due to environmental concern. Superhydrophobic and self-cleaning cellulose surfaces were fabricated by combining ATRP with post-functionalisation. Glycidyl methacrylate was grafted from filter paper, and the epoxide groups were used as reactive handles to create a branched “graft-on-graft” architecture. Post-functionalisation of this architecture with perfluorinated chains or alkyl chains resulted in the formation of superhydrophobic surfaces. Grafting of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) from filter paper yielded cellulose surfaces capable of switching the wettability, from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, in response to changes in temperature. The wettability of cellulose surfaces grafted with poly(4 -vinylpyridine) (P 4 VP) could be adjusted from hydrophilic to hydrophobic by changing pH. Furthermore, cellulose surfaces responding to changes in both pH and temperature were obtained via grafting of block copolymers of PNIPAAm and P 4 VP. The use of inorganic nano-particles in composites has attracted considerable academic and industrial interest due to their excellent mechanical and thermal properties. Styrene was grafted from the surface of silica nanoparticles using ATRP. The resulting organic-inorganic hybrid materials did not aggregate to the same extent as the un-modified silica particles. The polystyrene-modified silica particles were used for the fabrication of honeycomb membranes. It was evident that the pore sizes and the number of porous layers could be tuned by varying the conditions used for film casting.

40|$|AbstractAmong {{the various}} type of seals used in gas turbine {{secondary}} air system to guarantee sufficient confinement of the <b>main</b> gas path, <b>honeycomb</b> seals well perform {{in terms of}} enhanced stability and reduced leakage flow. Reliable estimates of the sealing performance of honeycomb packs employed in industrial gas and steam turbines, are however missing in literature, thus, in order to evaluate the complete characteristic curve of the seals in {{the wide range of}} working conditions, an experimental campaign was planned. This work reports the findings of an experimental campaign aimed at evaluating aerodynamic losses within honeycomb seals. Due to the generally large amount of honeycomb cells typically present in real seals, it would be convenient to treat the sealing effect of the honeycomb pack as an increased distributed friction factor on the plain top surface that is why the simplest config- uration, the honeycomb facing a flat plate, is employed in this paper. The geometry of the hexagonal cell and the investigated clearances were chosen to well represent actual honeycomb packs employed in industrial compressors. First the pressure distribu- tion within the seal was analysed verifying that downstream the first 5 rows of cells, where entrance effects are predominant, the relative pressure drop is almost constant thus the use of an equivalent friction factor is appropriate to characterize the seal. Subse- quent analysis focused on the characterization of the friction factor as function of the Reynolds number with the aim of establishing the proper geometrical scaling to achieve flow conditions similar to real turbine most critical ones. The different behaviour of the honeycomb sealing depending on the hexagonal cell arrangement and dimensions was evaluated in terms of friction factor. Comparison with results coming from a previous CFD investigation is also presented and discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This {{computational}} {{and theoretical}} study investigates the self-assembly of superparamagnetic nanoparticles and block copolymers under external magnetic fields. A variety of morphological transitions are observed {{based on the}} field orientation, nanoparticle loading, and selectivity of the nanoparticles for the blocks. For symmetric block copolymers, chaining of superparamagnetic nanoparticles under in-plane magnetic fields is shown to achieve long range orientational order of the block copolymer nanodomains and {{is found to be}} dependent on nanoparticle size, volume fraction and magnetization strength. A critical selectivity of the particles for one nanodomain is observed, above which strong alignment results and below which comparatively disordered structures are formed. Higher magnetization strengths are found to reduce equilibrium defect densities in the nematic-isotropic ordering of lamellar thin films, as corroborated by scaling arguments. For asymmetric coil fractions forming hexagonal block copolymer nanostructure, the inplane field induced chaining of the nanoparticles selective for the minority block, leads to the formation of stripe phases oriented parallel to the magnetic field. Furthermore, in-plane field induced chaining of nanoparticles selective for the majority block leads to alignment of hexagonal morphology with direction oriented parallel to the external magnetic field. Out of plane magnetic fields induce repulsive dipolar interactions between the nanoparticles that annihilate the defects in the hexagonal morphology of the block copolymer when the nanoparticle is selective for the minority <b>block.</b> <b>Honeycomb</b> lattices are obtained using nanoparticles selective for majority block under out of plane magnetic fields for certain specific nanoparticle loadings. Commensurability of nanoparticle size and loadings with the block copolymer structure is critical in optimizing the ordering of the final composite. Kinetics of alignment in block copolymer nanocomposites is studied using External Potential Dynamics (EPD) method, wherein an equivalent evolution equation for potential fields is solved instead of conservation equation for the monomer segments. The dynamics study reveals an interesting interplay of nanoparticle mobility, dipolar interaction strength and nanoparticle-polymer interaction strength on the rate of alignment of domains. by Vinay Raman.
