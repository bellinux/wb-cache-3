60|$|In the {{meantime}} {{a scene of}} a different kind {{was going on in the}} House of Commons. Melmotte had been seated on one of the back Conservative benches, and there he remained for a considerable time unnoticed and forgotten. The little emotion that had attended his entrance had passed away, and Melmotte was now no more than any one else. At first he had taken his hat off, but, as soon as he observed that the majority of members were covered, he put it on again. Then he sat motionless for an hour, looking round him and wondering. He had never hitherto been even in the gallery of the House. The place was very much smaller than he had thought, and much less tremendous. The Speaker did not strike him with the awe which he had expected, and it seemed to him that they who spoke were talking much like other people in other places. For the first hour he hardly caught the meaning of a sentence that was said, nor did he try to do so. One man got up very quickly after another, some of them barely rising on their legs to say the few words that they uttered. It seemed to him to be a very commonplace affair,--not half so awful as those festive occasions on which he had occasionally been called upon to propose a toast or to return thanks. Then suddenly the manner of the thing was changed, and one gentleman made a long speech. Melmotte by this time, weary of observing, had begun to listen, and words which were familiar to him reached his ears. The gentleman was proposing some little addition to a commercial treaty and was expounding in very strong language the ruinous injustice to which England was exposed by being tempted to use gloves made in a country in which no income tax was levied. Melmotte listened to his eloquence caring nothing about gloves, and very little about England's ruin. But in the course of the debate which followed, a question arose about the value of <b>money,</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange,</b> and of the conversion of shillings into francs and dollars. About this Melmotte really did know something and he pricked up his ears. It seemed to him that a gentleman whom he knew very well in the city,--and who had maliciously stayed away from his dinner,--one Mr Brown, who sat just before him on the same side of the House, and who was plodding wearily and slowly along with some pet fiscal theory of his own, understood nothing at all of what he was saying. Here was an opportunity for himself! Here was at his hand the means of revenging himself for the injury done him, and of showing to the world at the same time that he was not afraid of his city enemies! It required some courage certainly,--this attempt that suggested itself to him of getting upon his legs a couple of hours after his first introduction to parliamentary life. But he was full of the lesson which he was now ever teaching himself. Nothing should cow him. Whatever was to be done by brazen-faced audacity he would do. It seemed to be very easy, and he saw no reason why he should not put that old fool right. He knew nothing of the forms of the House;--was more ignorant of them than an ordinary schoolboy;--but on that very account felt less trepidation than might another parliamentary novice. Mr Brown was tedious and prolix; and Melmotte, though he thought much of his project and had almost told himself that he would do the thing, was still doubting, when, suddenly, Mr Brown sat down. There did not seem to be any particular end to the speech, nor had Melmotte followed any general thread of argument. But a statement had been made and repeated, containing, as Melmotte thought, a fundamental error in finance; and he longed to set the matter right. At any rate he desired to show the House that Mr Brown did not know what he was talking about,--because Mr Brown had not come to his dinner. When Mr Brown was seated, nobody at once rose. The subject was not popular, and they who understood the business of the House were well aware that the occasion had simply been one on which two or three commercial gentlemen, having crazes of their own, should be allowed to ventilate them. The subject would have dropped;--but on a sudden the new member was on his legs.|$|E

The experiment is designed to simulate an environment where something that is very similar to fiat money (i. e., is homogenous, durable, portable, storable, divisible, has no intrinsic value of its own, etc.) will be accepted in market transactions and thus will have a “value. ” This is accomplished through an implementation of a taxation mechanism in the spirit of legal restriction theory of monetary economics.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the arguments advanced by Rousseau {{to explain his}} rejection <b>of</b> monetary <b>exchange.</b> First we show that the rejection <b>of</b> <b>money</b> as mean <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> expresses a dismissal of any form <b>of</b> <b>exchange,</b> motivated by a need for independence. In Julie, the community of Clarens exemplifies an autarchic, paternalistic economy {{that is at once}} unequal and deceptive. To understand why Rousseau chose such a downbeat solution to the problems arising from the organisation of the division of labour, we make a parallel between the economic and amatory themes, showing in each case the dependence upon others produced by the development of amour-propre.

40|$|This essay investigates {{employee}} buyouts {{and does}} so {{from a number}} of different perspectives. Employee buyout is a term that describes a way of ending an employment through an agreement where the employee gets a sum <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> leaving their employment. Technically it is neither a resignation, since the employee gives up the employment in <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> nor a dismissal since the employer does not have legal grounds for dismissing the employee. Employee buyout is not an illegal way to end an employment, {{as long as it is}} the result of a mutual agreement between the employer and the employee. In this essay I investigate and analyze employee buyouts in relation to 7 § in the Swedish employment protection act, and also Swedish employment protection in relation to regulations from EU regarding employment protection. Furthermore, I investigate buyouts of employees in the organization of Växjö Municipality, from a gender equality perspective. In this study of Växjö municipality differences shows regarding male and female employees and number of buyouts. In my analysis I try to explain these differences using gender theory and sociolinguistic theory...|$|R
