5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the grid order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry and sunny conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his third pole position of the season, his fifth at the circuit, with a time of 1:18.439. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Coulthard who qualified 0.098 seconds behind Michael Schumacher's time having battled the Ferrari driver for grid position throughout the session. Barrichello qualified in 3rd position and was happy with his Ferrari. Häkkinen encountered traffic during his qualifying runs and managed fourth. Frentzen, who qualified 5th, had to overcome heavy gusts at the L'Epingle hairpin where he found it difficult to find his braking spot. Villeneuve was sixth with teammate Zonta in eighth. Trulli split them for seventh position. Pedro de la Rosa in an Arrows car and Fisichella completed the top ten fastest qualifiers. Herbert missed out on qualifying in the top ten by two hundredths of a second though {{he said that he was}} happy with his car. Ralf Schumacher set the 12th quickest time despite his Williams suffering a lack of <b>mechanical</b> <b>grip.</b> He was ahead of Verstappen who crashed his car at turn 4 which caused a temporary suspension to qualifying. The resultant damage caused him to use his team's spare monocoque. Wurz, in the second Benetton, lost time when he caught the aftermath of Verstappen's collision and was 14th fastest. Salo battled with his rear wheel locking on downshifts and took 15th. He started in front of Irvine in the slower of the two Jaguars. Jean Alesi's Prost qualified 17th despite an engine failure, ahead of Button and Diniz. The Minardi drivers qualified at the back of the grid, covering positions 20 to 22 with Heidfeld splitting them for 21st.|$|E

In case of positioning devices with less than 6 degrees of freedom, flexibility in terms of adaptation to the orientation of the objects is required. The flexibility of existing gripping systems is often reduced by the design of the utilized end effector. In case of <b>mechanical</b> <b>gripping</b> devices, the achievable precision in the field of micro and precision assembly is strongly defined by the shape of the end effector surfaces.

40|$|Robots {{that are}} {{developed}} for applications which require a high stiffness-over-inertia ratio, such as pick-and-place robots, machining robots, or haptic devices, are {{often based on}} parallel manipulators. Parallel manipulators connect an end-effector to an inertial base using multiple serial kinematic chains. This architecture enables the design of robots with all actuators located at the base, which greatly reduces the effective inertia with no detrimental effect on the stiffness, thus improving the stiffness-over-inertia ratio. One {{of the limitations of}} current parallel manipulators is that gripping requires an additional, dedicated subsystem, which either degrades performance or can only handle objects with a flat surface. A promising alternative solution for future gripping robots are parallel manipulators with two end-effectors (PM 2 Es). These PM 2 Es facilitate <b>mechanical</b> <b>gripping</b> using an internal closed-loop chain, which enables gripping robots that have all their actuators located at the base. As such, PM 2 Es combine <b>mechanical</b> <b>gripping</b> with a favorable stiffness-over-inertia ratio. Because of the potential benefits in both cost and hygiene, the integration of compliant joints is identified as a second promising development for future gripping robots. The benefits of PM 2 Es and those of compliant joints can be enjoyed simultaneously if compliant PM 2 Es are designed. However, it is currently not possible to effectively design compliant PM 2 Es, because existing stiffness analyses methods do not directly apply to PM 2 Es. To overcome this limitation, in this thesis a stiffness analysis method is developed that is also valid for compliant PM 2 Es. In Chapter 2 insights from screw theory are used to develop a novel Jacobian-based stiffness analysis method for parallel manipulators, which is more general than existing methods. The stiffness analysis method takes the influence of actuators, compliant joints, as well as structural elements into account, and also considers the effect of loading. Stiffness in the constrained directions of individual serial chains is represented using virtual joints, which allows structural compliance to be considered for any parallel manipulator with non-redundant legs. This includes lower mobility parallel manipulators, which have less than six degrees of freedom. Loading is taken into account using a term that depends on the derivative of a Jacobian matrix. The developed stiffness analysis method is experimentally validated in Chapter 3. It is shown that the accuracy of a stiffness analysis improves if the effect of loading is considered and also if structural compliance is included in the analysis. The example stiffness matrices in Chapter 3 are all symmetric, which is in line with the definition of a stiffness matrix. In contrast, Griffis and Duffy (1993) found asymmetric stiffness matrices when they analyzed two mechanisms under loading. Loading cannot be part of a stiffness analysis if it can lead to asymmetric matrices, which explains the extensive discussions surrounding their work. Chapter 4 demonstrates that the asymmetry in the work by Griffis and Duffy can be explained as a modeling inconsistency. It is also shown that consistent modeling results in symmetric matrices, which supports the notion that loading {{is an integral part of}} a stiffness analysis of parallel manipulators. Chapter 5 presents a systematic approach for the Jacobian analysis of PM 2 Es in order to extend the Jacobian-based stiffness analysis method of Chapter 2 to PM 2 Es. Previously, Jacobian analyses of PM 2 Es have only been performed for specific examples, but this thesis introduces structure to the Jacobian analysis of PM 2 Es by considering each end-effector as a rigid body with its own six-dimensional motion vector, and by representing a PM 2 E as an organization of serial chains. In Chapter 5 it is also shown that the structural compliance of internal serial chains must be considered in order to deal with relative degrees of freedom that are constrained between the two end-effectors. In Chapter 6 the stiffness analysis method of Chapter 2 and the Jacobian analysis of Chapter 5 are integrated and the very first stiffness matrices of PM 2 Es are presented. An experimental verification of these stiffness matrices demonstrates that the developed stiffness analysis method also applies to compliant parallel manipulators with two end-effectors. Therefore, the method introduced in this thesis is ready to be used for the effective design of novel gripping robots. Mechatronic Systems Desig...|$|R

The project team achieved a thirty-percent reduction in grip inventory in six months by consolidating redundant supply chains, changing from a make-to-stock to a make-to-order process, and changing from material resource planning to pull production. The inventory reduction increased the inventory turns from less than two to over four turns per year. Strategic inventory placement models suggested the problem could be split into two separate approaches: (1) managing the capacity of the job shop to meet the increased demand from supply chain consolidation; and (2) developing a control system for component and raw material inventories. The analysis of the capacity of the grip assembly job shop uses optimization techniques to specify the assembly lot sizes for the various grips and queuing theory to estimate the reserve capacity required to maintain cycle times under probabilistic demand. Simulations of the job shop assembly process validate the analysis and resource management plan. The continuous review control system specifies reorder points and order quantities for the hundreds of detail components and raw materials. The team's efforts are expected to reduce inventory by a similar amount in the coming months as excessive stocks are consumed. Recommendations for further reductions include improved component outsourcing, disposition of slow-moving inventory, and optimization of safety stock levels. Implementation of these recommendations will lead to inventory reductions of similar magnitude. by Daniel H. Wheeler. Thesis (S. M.)

50|$|The Deer gun {{was made}} of cast aluminium, with the {{receiver}} formed into a cylinder {{at the top of}} the weapon. The striker protruded from the rear of the receiver and was cocked in order to fire, and a plastic clip was placed there to prevent an accidental discharge, as the Deer gun had no <b>mechanical</b> safety. The <b>grip</b> had raised checkering, was hollow, and had space for three 9 mm rounds and a rod for clearing the barrel of spent cases. The Deer gun lacked any marking identifying manufacturer or user, in order to prevent tracing of the weapons, and all were delivered in unmarked polystyrene boxes with three 9 mm rounds and a series of pictures depicting the operation of the gun. A groove ran down a ramp on top for sighting. The barrel unscrewed for loading and removing the empty casing. A cocking knob was pulled until cocked. The aluminium trigger had no trigger guard.|$|R
