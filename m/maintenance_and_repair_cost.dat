Several types of hybrid electric vehicles including parallel hybrids (with and without external charging) and a serial range extended electric vehicle are {{compared to a}} conventional car with SI engine, a full battery electric vehicle and a hydrogen powered fuel cell vehicle. Special focus lies on the <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repair</b> <b>cost</b> and the expected resale value of alternative vehicles, which have been integrated within one extensive {{total cost of ownership}} model. The assessment shows that the current TCO gaps for alternative drivetrains will decrease significantly by 2020 mainly driven by the reduction in production cost. Furthermore hybrid electric vehicles will profit from lower <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repair</b> <b>cost</b> and a higher expected resale value compared to conventional cars. Therefore, hybrid electric vehicles will be an attractive option in particular for users with high annual mileages, who can benefit from the low operating cost of EVs in combination with unlimited driving range. The analysis concludes that there will not be one dominant powertrain design in the midterm future. Hence, automakers have to manage a wide portfolio of competing drivetrain architectures, which will increase the risk and complexity of strategic decisions...|$|E

40|$|Self-healing {{concrete}} {{is regarded}} as a promising solution to reduce the high <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repair</b> <b>cost</b> of concrete infrastructure. Due to the limited autogenous healing capacity of concrete itself, additives are needed to enhance the self-healing properties. These healing agents are pre-added into the concrete during mixing or casting and are expected to play their role (heal cracks) when cracking occurs. This PhD work aims to explore a microbial-based self-healing strategy for concrete, which has the distinct features of environmental friendliness, long-term viability and low cost. Carbonate precipitating bacteria were added into mortar specimens to in-situ heal concrete cracks when cracking occurred. Two constituents are of crucial importance in this strategy, the microbial source and the carriers for immobilization of bacteria. Bacillus sphaericus, an alkali spore-forming ureolytic strain, was selected as the microbial source due to its high carbonate production capacity, alkali adaptability and long-term viability. Four types of carriers were investigated in this study. In view of the self-healing efficiency and the possibility for practical use, the most promising carriers are microcapsules and superabsorbent polymers. Overall, the results of this doctoral research demonstrated the feasibility of using immobilized carbonate precipitating bacteria for self-healing concrete.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} {{structures in}} marine environment {{are subjected to}} chloride penetration, which significantly degrades the structural performance due to the occurrence of corrosion in the steel reinforcement. The performance degradation of the structures would reduce the intended service life and caused higher <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repair</b> <b>cost.</b> Therefore, system to monitor chloride penetration into reinforced concrete before the starting corrosion of reinforcement is indispensable. An embedded probe system to detect chloride penetration into concrete was developed in Japan.

However, the probe had not yet had high sensitivity for detecting critical chloride content in concrete. Therefore to increase its sensitivity, four types of improvements, namely partial coating of the wires, waterproofing on the probe body, filling the ditches with porous material and supplying small current on the wires were evaluated in this study.

Minimizing the labor and capital-intensive <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repair</b> <b>cost</b> is a critical challenge. Thus, self-healing mortars with modified strength are proposed. Lately, self-healing of micro-cracks by introducing bacteria during the formation of mortar or concrete became attractive. Self-healing with polymeric admixtures {{is considered to be}} relatively more durable and faster process. Certainly, the self-healing of synthetic polymeric materials is inspired by biological systems, where the damage triggers an autonomic healing response. This emerging and fascinating research initiative may significantly improve the durability and the safety limit of the polymeric components potential for assorted applications. In this work, using epoxy resin (diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A) without any hardener as admixture polymeric-cementitious materials is prepared. These epoxy-modified mortars are synthesized with various polymer-cement ratios subjected to initial wet/dry curing (WDC) together with long term dry curing (DC). Their self-healing function and hardening effects are evaluated via preloading and drying of the specimens, chemical analysis, and ultrasonic pulse velocity testing. It is demonstrated that 10 % of polymer is the best proportion for polymer-cement ratio. Furthermore, the wet/dry curing is established to be superior process for healing hairline cracks present in the mortar.

40|$|Abstract—Failure {{mechanisms}} of electromechanical systems usually involve several degraded health-states. Tracking and forecasting {{the evolution of}} health-states and impending failures, {{in the form of}} remaining-useful-life (RUL), is a critical challenge and regarded as the Achilles ’ heel of condition-based-maintenance (CBM). This paper demonstrates how this difficult problem can be addressed through Hidden Markov models (HMMs) that are able to estimate unobservable health-states using observable sensor signals. In particular, implementation of HMM based models as dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) facilitates com-pact representation as well as additional flexibility with regard to model structure. Both regular HMM pools and hierarchical HMMs are employed here to estimate online the health-state of drill-bits as they deteriorate with use on a CNC drilling machine. Hierarchical HMM is composed of sub-HMMs in a pyramid structure, providing functionality beyond an HMM for modeling complex systems. In the case of regular HMMs, each HMM within the pool competes to represent a distinct health-state and adapts through competitive learning. In the case of hierarchical HMMs, health-states are represented as distinct nodes {{at the top of the}} hierarchy. Monte Carlo simulation, with state transition probabilities derived from a hierarchical HMM, is employed for RUL estimation. Detailed results on health-state and RUL estimation are very promising and are reported in this paper. Hierarchical HMMs seem to be particularly effective and efficient and outperform other HMM methods from literature. Note to Practitioners—Today’s high competitive environment forces industry to decrease operating and support cost, whose one of the most contributing factors is <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repair</b> <b>cost.</b> Thus, industry is interested not only in the identification of fail-ures, but also in identification of failure states, their progression and forecasting.

40|$|Self-healing {{concrete}} {{is regarded}} as a promising solution to reduce the high <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repair</b> <b>cost</b> of concrete infrastructure. Due to the limited autogenous healing capacity of concrete as such, additives are needed to enhance its self-healing properties. Among various strategies, microbial-based self-healing has gained increasing attention because of its distinct features including environmental friendliness, long-term viability and low cost. Within the framework of this strategy, bacteria and the relevant bio-reagents are pre-added into the concrete during the casting and are expected to play their role (heal cracks) when cracking occurs. Due to the high alkalinity and small pore sizes of concrete, bacteria cannot be added directly, and hence an immobilization process is required prior to incorporation into concrete. In the present work, a bio-compatible hydrogel was evaluated as the carrier to encapsulate an efficient carbonate precipitating bacteria, Bacillus sphaericus, which was selected based on previous research. As proof of concept, the activity of bacterial spores after immobilization, the carbonatogenesity of the hydrogel encapsulated spores, the influence of the bio-agents on the hydrogel swelling properties, and the crack healing efficiency were investigated. Interestingly, no significant viability loss was observed after the immobilization process. The precipitation of CaCO 3 in/on the hydrogel matrix by the encapsulated spores was demonstrated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The swelling capacity of the hydrogel was slightly increased after incorporation of the bio-agents. In addition, the specimens combined with the bio-hydrogels showed an obvious superiority in crack healing efficiency, both with respect to the healing rate as well as the maximum healed crack width. A maximum crack width of about 0. 5 mm can be healed in the specimens containing bio-hydrogels within 7 d, while no crack healing was observed in the reference specimens. The feasibility of using hydrogel immobilized bacteria for self-healing concrete is therefore demonstrated...|$|E

Assessing the conditions of infrastructures is important to determine their safety and reliability which have {{a great impact on}} today's society. The existing NDE techniques include acoustics, ultrasound, radiology, thermography, electromagnetic method, optical method, and so on. Properly employed NDE techniques can reduce the <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repair</b> <b>cost</b> and improve the reliability of the infrastructures. In the last two decades, the study of the highly nonlinear solitary waves (HNSWs) has received much attention. Most of these studies focused on the propagation of HNSWs in granular systems, but little work on applications of HNSW-based NDE method has been done. HNSWs are mechanical waves that can form and travel in highly nonlinear systems, one-dimensional chain of identical spheres {{is one of the most}} common systems that can support the generation and propagation of HNSWs. In the study presented in this dissertation, a new NDE technique based on the generation and propagation of HNSWs was investigated and applied to different structural materials. First, fundamental research on the generation of HNSWs in a chain of stainless steel beads by laser pulses was conducted. The results showed that the laser-based generation of HNSWs produces results that are equivalent to those obtained by means of a mechanical striker. Then, the feasibility of tuning HNSWs by electromagnetically induced precompression was demonstrated experimentally. By changing the precompression on the chain of particles, the properties of the HNSWs could be tuned in a wide range. Then a HNSW-based transducer was designed and built. The transducer was remotely and automatically controlled by National Instruments PXI running Labview. The ability of the new transducer to generate repeatable HNSWs was assessed. Finally, the HNSW transducer was used to monitor cement setting, concrete curing and epoxy curing, to evaluate the bond condition of an aluminum lap-joint, and to detect the impact damages in a composite plate. The results showed that the HNSW-based technique is promising for structural NDE.

The purpose of a TAM plan is to prioritize expenditures of transportation funding in a manner that promotes construction, replacement, and maintenance projects that provides the highest overall network condition. Current prioritization algorithms favor high volume roads and bridges over those with low volumes. Iowa is an agricultural state and as a result has a lot of Farm-to-Market (FM), major and minor collector roads. Much of the rural road network is managed at the county level. Iowa counties have limited ability to fund the needed maintenance and replacement of low volume bridges, making it essential for County Engineers to have a decision tool to properly allocate available funds and execute effective asset management. This research focuses on the development of a simplified Conceptual Life-Cycle Cost Analysis (CLCCA) model that {{can be used as a}} decision making tool by county engineers. It focuses on rural low-volume bridges in three counties in Iowa - Boone, Story and Marion - which have an Average Daily Traffic (ADT) of less than 50 vehicles. The research found that the data necessary to populate the classic bridge LCCA model was not available in many cases because the counties simply do not use an accounting system that allows specific minor maintenance and repair costs to be directly associated with specific bridges. The lack of <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repair</b> <b>cost</b> data acts as a barrier to implementing a LCCA-based TAM plan at county-level. Therefore, the proposed model is designed to make maximum use of the available information to the typical Iowa County Engineer and provides a conceptual life-cycle cost. The conceptual life cycle cost thus obtained can be used for making important transportation investment decisions such as in the allocation of funds and to establish an efficient TAM plan at the county level. The research validated the model using a stochastic sensitivity analysis. The results of the sensitivity analysis are presented and show that the most sensitive factor contributing to the final conceptual life cycle cost is the discount rate used in the calculation. The results of the CLCCA vary from a comprehensive LCCA by less than 1...|$|E

Industrry is {{the biggest}} {{potential}} that creates the environmental pollution. Textile industry is categorized in varied industry branches with high water consuming and high waste water producing. During the industrial production and after different kinds of wastes come into being which causes environmental pollution. Production diversity in textile industry affects the waste water categorization. Textile industry includes different varieties of production proceseses causes waste water characteristics become so different and shows different consantrations in unit waste water amount. The water which is used at the poduction proses in the textile industry must be in a definite quality. The properties of the water used in textile fabrics directly {{affect the quality of}} the produced materials. It shows negative effect directly on the product quality if the water quality is not as it is needed. For this reason the quality of water is very important for preparing the ideal product. The waste water of textile industry is rather more coloured than the other industry branches because of the painting materials. The conventional treatment methods are unable to textile industry wastewater process due to the biologically resistant to decomposition of dyes and dye auxiliary chemical substances for thire complex structure. At the present, As the hold method(such as biological treatment, coagulation, adsorption), can not provide sufficient treatment, new technologies are needed for reusing and recovering of the waste water to reducing the consuming of water soure. For the recovery of textile wastewaters, membrane processes can meet this need with its High performance.

The aims of the pre pretreatment are: - To prolonged the work time of the membrane - To prevent the blockage of membrane. - To increase the performance of the system. - To reduce the <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>repair</b> <b>cost</b> of the system. In this study, applying pre- treatment methods before the membrane systems and the different membrane filtration systems in the subject of the treatment and recovery of the waste waters that belongs to different processes’, it is tried to be set up the highest filtration productivity that supplies in the membrane sorts and most proper pre-treatment method. At the same time the effect of the removal efficiency is researched by considerating the alternative of the pre-treatment. In this Laboratory-scale study, At first, characterization studies were carried out. The wastewater samples were taken from outputs of process of maximum water consumption and maximum wastewater production of Zorlu Linen Dokuma Emprime Konfeksiyon San. ve Tic. A. Ş. and color, conductivity, and COD analyzes were carried out. And then, Experimental studies to be carried out separately on the wastewater resulting from the washing process of woven finishing and bleaching proses of knit fabric finishing at the plant, In the Studies, different pre-treatment alternatives were determined for using wastewater and then the pre-treatment alternative which providing optimum conditions was selected for the final treatment of wastewater with membrane processes. In the characterization work, COD, conductivity and color parameters were measured for the sample. In the treatability studies for the selection of the membrane the all monitored parameters in the raw water and treated water are: flux, temperature, pH, conductivity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and color. In this experimental study mikrofiltration(MF- 0, 05 µm, MF- 0, 2 µm), ultrafiltration(UF) (UC 010 T), ozonation, UV-TiO 2, modified and unmodified zeolite sistem, ultrasound(UF) (UC 010 T), are used for the pre-treatment. For the last treatment, nanofiltration (NF) (270) and revers osmose(RO) (XLE) membrane systems are used. At the result of pre-treatmen process, all the compares has been done which are supplied from the analysis of the water quality parameters. From the achievable alternatives of the pre-treatmen, the most available pre-treatmen combination is choosed and the filtrate current is subjected to the last treatment process by the helping of membrane process. Experiments are done as pre-treatment and unpre-treatment style. In the pre-treatment tests the raw water directly feed to the membrane filtration for final treatment, In the pre-treatment experiments before the pre-treatment was operated and the obtained filtrate was subjected to membrane filtration for final treatment, and the results are given as a comparison. As a result, the different combinations of each which was tried for applicable pre-treatment alternatives of each shows different consequences. Also each pre-treatment alternative’s that supplies excellence elimination water quality parameter shows difference. For this reason in the choise of the pre-treatment which will realize prufying process must be known very well and in this way proper pre-treatment alternative must be chosen taking care to remove wanted pollutant parameter. To value the experimental studies, membrane types which for the parameter of the flow achieved high flux values, for water quality parameters achieved highest removal efficiencies were selected. The flux values that continuously monitored was before decreased and then was going to be constant. High-flux values obtained with NF 270 nanofiltration membrane, and high removal efficiencies were obtained with reverse osmosis XLE membrane. In the bleaching wastewater treatment, removal efficiencies which are supplied by the NF 270 nanafiltration applications mostly are less than the removal efficiencies which are supplied by the revers osmoz mambrane. The highest curent value is recorded as 42 L/m 2. sa which are realized in the NF 270 nanofiltration experiments and this value is acheieved by pre-treatmen applacation using the 0, 05 µm microfiltration. The lowest current value is supplied by result of NF 270 application after the ultrasound experiment. For the XLE reverse osmos membrane the higeset current value is achieved by the UC 010 T ultrafiltration pre-treatment process, the lowest current value is supplied as a result by the application of UV/TiO 2. At the recovery of bleaching proses effluents, in terms of removal efficiency effective results yielded from zeolite pre-treatment, to obtain a high flux, effective results yielded from UF pre-treatment. For the NF 270 membrane, the MF pre-treatment application also gave positive results, especially to achieving high flux. Bleaching wastewater was passed through NF 270 nanofiltration membrane after pre-treatment and results showes that according to the non-pretreatmen condation COD removal efficiency increased nearly to 42 %, for XLE reverse osmosis membrane, according to the non-pretreatmen condation COD removal efficiency has an increase of 50 %. In the washing proses removal efficiencies which are supplied by the NF 270 nanafiltration applications mostly are less than the removal efficiencies which are supplied by the revers osmoz mambrane. The flux value of nanofiltration is higher than XLE. The highest curent value is recorded as 43 L/m 2. sa which are realized in the NF 270 nanofiltration experiments and this value is acheieved by pre-treatmen applacation using the ultrafiltration. The lowest flux value is supplied by result of NF 270 application after the zeolite experiment. For the XLE reverse osmos membrane the higheset flux value is achieved by the UC 010 T ultrafiltration pre-treatment process, the lowest current value is supplied as a result by the application of 0. 2 µm microfiltration pre-treatment process. At the recovery of washing wastewater, in terms of removal efficiency and to achieve high flux, MF and UF pre-treatment sistems gave effective results. For the NF 270 membrane, the MF pre-treatment application also gave positive results, especially to achieving high flux. In this study which using membrane technologies and a variety of pre-treatment alternatives, color parameter that an important parameter for textile industries wastewater and up to now has not a standard in our country on this parameter was largely removed. In this Project, The all experiment results showes that reusable quality can be reached in textile industry wastewater by using the membrane technology. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
