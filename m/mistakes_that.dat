5|$|In 1875, a {{detailed}} {{list of all}} passengers and crew was published by J.H. Lewis, Printer & Publisher, albeit with several errors and spelling <b>mistakes.</b> <b>That</b> document {{was used as the}} main source of the following survivors' table.|$|E
5|$|According to The Washington Times writer Rick Snyder, Vogel did {{not know}} the horse racing {{business}} and made <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> negatively affected the industry in Maryland. The year-round racing Rosecroft was awarded lowered the excitement for the locals. Rosecroft was not capable of attracting a new market, and attendance figures declined. He never focused on marketing or daily operations of Rosecroft. Instead, Vogel focused more on his real estate business. As a result, the attendance dropped. Vogel took out money from the betting pools to help his real estate business. Lower betting pools mean smaller payouts for the bettors and less profit for the racetrack owners. Vogel never formed political ties to help pass legislation used to help harness racing, more specially to allow off-track betting and to lower the state tax on betting pools.|$|E
5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{highlighted}} what {{he perceived}} as scenes in Red Rackham's Treasure which reflected common themes in The Adventures of Tintin. He {{pointed out that}} in being a stowaway aboard the ship, Calculus {{was one of many}} stowaways in the series, and that the treasure represented the theme of jewels and precious stones which also cropped up in The Broken Ear, Tintin in the Congo, and The Castafiore Emerald. He noted Tintin's misreading of the parchments and stated this was {{one of a number of}} calculation <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> the character makes in the series. He suggested that a scene in which the shark submarine pushes between Haddock's buttocks was a form of sexual innuendo referencing anal sex, highlighting similar innuendo in The Broken Ear and The Crab with the Golden Claws.|$|E

[...] In the second line, Fanning states that [...] "I made a <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> I'll never surpass", before {{explaining}} {{that it does not}} matter whose fault it is, in saying [...] "I know you needed someone to take the fall/I know you needed someone to blame it on". [...] In the second verse, Fanning again reiterates that he feels pain in the <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> was made, when he says [...] "I found my heart and it broke like glass/I made <b>that</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> I'll never surpass".|$|R

50|$|This film is {{well known}} for its poignant {{expression}} of guilt. The film portrays with great sensitivity the story of a doctor who tries to atone for a <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> he committed as a student - a <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> destroyed a family. This film script is {{regarded as one of the}} masterpieces of M. T. Vasudevan Nair.|$|R
5|$|Rosecroft {{was sold}} to Mark Vogel in 1987. Vogel made several <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> hurt the horse racing {{industry}} in Maryland. Three years later, {{he was arrested for}} possession of cocaine, and his company went into bankruptcy. Rosecroft {{was sold to}} Weisman's Colt Enterprises in 1991. In that same year, the grandstand caught fire and was reconstructed in 1993 for $3.6 million. In 1995, after losing millions, the relatives of Weisman sold Rosecroft to Cloverleaf Enterprises. In the 2000s, Cloverleaf attempted to sell Rosecroft multiple times, but due to lawsuits and politics, all the potential buyers became uninterested. Nearby states legalized casinos to help their racetracks. Money generated from the casinos was used to increase the purses and handle (daily betting turnover), and Rosecroft was unable to produce the same amount of money. After filing for bankruptcy once again, Rosecroft Raceway closed down in 2010. The next year, Penn National Gaming purchased the racetrack with the hope to make it a racino, and Rosecroft reopened in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Whoever {{looks in}} the past and thinks about the time of 1919 to 1932 will be {{overpowered}} by great pain {{in the face of the}} <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> have been made. When Hitler published his book Mein Kampf, it was time to begin the most stringent battle against the theories proposed in that book. Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions, even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion. What would a man do if a thief announced a proposed break-in? Anybody would make security arrangements. And what did the government and the representatives of the people do? As much as nothing. A tired, weak and sick population, as well as a weak government, let a charlatan of the worst sort promise them healing. For every problem this quack had the only right medicine. He alone possessed the magic wand that would uproot human weakness and produce angels.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{reviews of}} defence {{policy and the}} {{strategic}} situation in South East Asia after the war had resulted {{in the formation of}} the Australian Regiment in 1948, the first regular infantry unit of the Australian Army. From that time on as tension within the region increased the strength of the Regular Army increased rapidly in contrast to the CMF, signifying if not an end to Australian military planners' reliance upon citizen soldiers, at least a shift in focus and a realisation of the <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> had been made prior to World War II. This would see the CMF providing a platform upon which the Army could mobilise in the event of a war. Initially, the plan had been for the CMF to be made up of 50,000 men organised into two divisions and other units, however, recruitment was unable to meet these targets as initially it was attempted to achieve this through voluntary enlistment. Indeed, in its first year of existence, the actual strength of the CMF was only 8,698 personnel, although this rose the following year to 16,202 and to 32,779 in 1950. In March 1951, a system of compulsory national service was re-established.|$|E

25|$|Debate {{persists}} {{as to how}} and why the British {{lost the}} battle. Many arguments focus on possible local tactical occurrences, as opposed to the strategic lapses and failings in grand tactics on the part of high command under Bartle Frere and Chelmsford. Still, the latter comes under scrutiny for <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> may have led directly to the British defeat.|$|E

25|$|Joseph W. Houppert {{acknowledges}} that {{some critics have}} tried to cast Caesar as the protagonist, but that ultimately Brutus {{is the driving force}} in the play and is therefore the tragic hero. Brutus attempts to put the republic over his personal relationship with Caesar and kills him. Brutus makes the political <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> bring down the republic that his ancestors created. He acts on his passions, does not gather enough evidence to make reasonable decisions and is manipulated by Cassius and the other conspirators.|$|E
25|$|I brought {{controls}} to the Tour {{in the wake}} of Tom Simpson's death in 1967 – and the riders went on strike. After the discoveries made , I feel real resentment towards the medical and scientific powers who deceived us for 30 years. The controls are almost always negative, which means that the labs have been making serious mistakes, <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> have only served to speed up the growth of this evil. The controls we developed after Simpson's death were a lie, covered up by the highest scientific and medical authorities, and I condemn them.|$|E

He is co-author, along with Mary Bennett, of Dark Moon: Apollo and the Whistle-Blowers and co-producer of What Happened On the Moon? He is the main proponent of the 'whistle-blower' accusation, arguing that mistakes in the NASA photos are so obvious that they are evidence that insiders are trying to 'blow the whistle' on the hoax by knowingly adding <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> they know will be seen. Most of his allegations of photographic anomalies have been refuted by Doug Millard of the Science Museum in London.|$|E
25|$|In April 1979, HBO {{launched}} its {{first attempt at}} a spin-off service, Take 2. Designed as a family-oriented mini-pay service, Take 2 was essentially formatted {{as an alternative to}} HBO, without any R-rated program content. The channel was ultimately deemed a major failure due to low subscribership and limited carriage by cable providers, and ceased operations late that summer. HBO management analysized the <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> led to Take 2's downfall, which would result {{in the development of the}} network's second and more successful attempt at a secondary pay service, the movie-focused Cinemax, which launched on August 1, 1980.|$|E
25|$|A manhunt for {{the other}} two {{suspects}} was conducted throughout the night and into the next day, when police located the two remaining suspects, who had been hiding in the woods; they were arrested without incident. The shootout between Lopez and the gunman had been videotaped by a camera in Lopez's cruiser. After the incident, Lopez told authorities that he believed the video of Lunsford's murder is what had saved his life that night. The video had helped him deal with the three suspects and he had learned {{not to make the}} same <b>mistakes</b> <b>that</b> Lunsford had made eight months earlier. For his actions, Trooper Lopez was awarded the Texas Department of Public Safety Medal of Valor, the highest award a commissioned trooper can receive.|$|E
