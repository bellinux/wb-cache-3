The general review principle of the <b>supervision</b> <b>monitoring</b> program is discussed in this article, and review suggestions of monitoring, evaluating and quality assurance are also given by focusing on requirements of technical details about key elements such as monitoring projects, sampling and monitoring points, frequencies and low limits of detection. For the <b>supervision</b> <b>monitoring</b> work of radioactive effluent of nuclear power plants, it can provide some guidance about {{the review of the}} <b>supervision</b> <b>monitoring</b> program for nuclear safety regulators, and provide some reference about the design and revision of the <b>supervision</b> <b>monitoring</b> program for nuclear safety monitoring departments...|$|R

My theoretical exposition predicts that an increase in remuneration reduces monitoring more in "sharing" than in "non-sharing" firms.

My empirical results confirm {{an inverse relationship}} between supervision and pay, but the trade-off is only heightened by performance-related pay and employee share ownership schemes. I find that employee share ownership and performance-related pay are more successful in alleviating the need to monitor. <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Supervision</b> Profit sharing Employee share ownership Efficiency wages...|$|E

The method for studying these activists is both ethno-  and nethnographic, through participant observations and interviews both online and offline. The theoretical framework is based on late modern theories of reflexive identity negotiation and Foucauldian theories of visibility and power. The paper locates relations of power in the constant <b>monitoring,</b> <b>supervision</b> and negotiation of both ones own and others’ identity on social media platforms. This increasing importance of being updated in network societies will be discussed as a form of network logic.   Hence, social media usage has not only been about enabling participation of activists in southern Stockholm, but also about disciplining them to be kept updated, which in turn pushes them towards participating in offline activities too...|$|E

The system consists of a web microserver using the power grid for the transmission and reception of data through technology PLC (Power Line Communication), as a solution for remote monitoring of temperature parameters of a mini turbine bench. In this article were performed comparative tests between the PLC and LAN technology in two distinct environments: residential and industrial. The analysis of network behavior was conducted through a network analysis software, which were established parameters that represent network performance when sending and receiving data from the monitoring system.

40|$|Recent bank {{crises in}} {{developed}} and developing countries have underlined {{the question of a}} good â€œregulatory regime,â€ which is a wider concept than the set of prudential principles and business rules established by external regulatory agencies. The role of external regulation in fostering a safe and sound banking system is limited. The incentive's structure for private banks and the efficiency of monitoring and supervision have to play a great role. Liberalization of markets can have bad effects in the transitional period, but advantages can be enormous after the system starts to work correctly.

Telehealth is the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to deliver health-related services when the provider and client are in different physical locations. Additional terms used to describe this service delivery model include: tele-occupational therapy, telerehabilitation, teletherapy, telecare, telemedicine, and telepractice, among other terms. Telehealth may be used by occupational therapy practitioners for evaluation, intervention, <b>monitoring,</b> <b>supervision,</b> and consultation (between remote therapist, client, and/or local health-care provider) as permitted by jurisdictional, institutional, and professional regulations and policies governing the practice of occupational therapy. Occupational therapy services via telehealth should be appropriate to the individuals, groups and cultures served, and contextualized to the occupations and interests of clients. Important considerations related to licensure/registration, collaboration with local occupational therapists, client selection, consent to treat, professional liability insurance, confidentiality, personal and cultural attributes, provider competence/standards of care, reimbursement/payer guidelines, and authentic occupational therapy practice are discussed. </div...|$|E
