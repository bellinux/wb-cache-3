25|$|The FTC's {{decision}} {{to pursue the}} case came in for some criticism. Some commentators, who thought the case title was humorous enough to make extended references to the Superman comics in their commentary, questioned whether the commission's action against a retailer who did not deceive any American consumers was a wise use of its limited resources, and whether it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> to prosecute him in Britain. Another, {{in the course of}} criticizing the failings of the European Union's Data Protection Directive when it came to dealing with cloud computing, did not criticize the enforcement action as such but showed that it pointed out how much more work needed to be done in ensuring compliance with the Safe Harbor Program.|$|E
25|$|As a player, Daniell was a pugnacious batsman of no {{exceptional}} talent, batting {{mostly in}} the middle order but occasionally promoting himself to open the innings. In almost 30 years of first-class cricket, he scored only nine centuries, and two of those were in one match in 1925. He never achieved 1,000 runs in a first-class season, and his career average was 21 runs an innings. He was noted as a fearless fielder, usually in positions in front of {{and close to the}} wicket. In his early career and at school, he had bowled fast, but in the 20 years from 1908 until he retired in 1927 he bowled only 10 overs in total in first-class cricket: that he took three wickets in them suggests he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> than he considered himself.|$|E

500|$|In January 1900, Southern Cross returned, {{picked up}} the shore party and, {{following}} the route which Ross had taken 60years previously, sailed southward to the Great Ice Barrier, which they discovered had retreated some [...] south {{since the days of}} Ross. A party consisting of Borchgrevink, William Colbeck and a Sami named Per Savio landed with sledges and dogs. This party ascended the Barrier and made the first sledge journey on the barrier surface; on 16 February 1900 they extended the Farthest South record to 78°50'S. On its return to England later in 1900, Borchgrevink's expedition was received without enthusiasm, despite its new southern record. Historian David Crane commented that if Borchgrevink had been a British naval officer, his contribution to Antarctic knowledge <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> received, but [...] "a Norwegian seaman/schoolmaster {{was never going to be}} taken seriously".|$|E

Although O'Neal liked the West song in the episode's final scene, O'Neal said [...] "cramming (West and Mencia) together — even mixed in with Cartman's very funny fantasy sequences — felt too cobbled to me, and the time limits imposed by cutting back and forth between it all made the respective digs start to feel a little too one-note." ...|$|E

[...] In the Senate Chamber, Johnson delivered a rambling address as Lincoln, the Congress, and dignitaries looked on.

500|$|As winter {{broke in}} 1799, on 1March, General Jean Baptiste Jourdan and his army of 25,000, [...] the {{so-called}} Army of the Danube, crossed the Rhine at Kehl. Instructed {{to block the}} Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes, the Army of the Danube would ostensibly isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in northern Italy, and prevent them from assisting one another; furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters. The Army of the Danube, meeting little resistance, advanced through the Black Forest in three columns, through the Höllental (Hölle valley), via Oberkirch, and Freudenstadt, and a fourth column advanced along {{the north shore of}} the Rhine. Although Jourdan <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> advised to establish a position on the eastern slope of the mountains, he did not. Instead, he pushed across the Danube plain and took up position between Rottweil and Tuttlingen, and eventually pushing toward the imperial city of Pfullendorf in Upper Swabia.|$|E
500|$|The {{timing and}} {{location}} of the launch event– {{in the middle of}} winter, {{on the top of a}} snow- and ice-covered hill– later prompted criticism even from Sinclair executives, who admitted off the record that spring conditions <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> for a vehicle with so little protection from the British climate. The Financial Times called it [...] "the worst possible timing to launch what was proclaimed to be a serious, road-going vehicle". Sinclair's biographer Rodney Dale describes it as [...] "a calculated (or miscalculated) risk", pointing out that production was already underway, details were beginning to leak out to the press and [...] "the launch could hardly have been held up until the possibility of a bright spring day". He justified the choice of January as being necessitated by a need to release the C5 [...] "as soon as possible lest the erroneous speculation should have done more harm than good". Rob Gray offers an alternative explanation, that the launch date had been brought forward because Sinclair's development funds were running low.|$|E

500|$|In another {{unqualified}} review, Time {{wrote that}} the film had [...] "a vitality that makes their efforts fully the equal of the original picture... Screenwriters Hurlbut & Balderston and Director James Whale have given it the macabre intensity proper to all good horror pieces, but have substituted a queer kind of mechanistic pathos for the sheer evil that was Frankenstein." [...] The Oakland Tribune concurred it was [...] "a fantasy produced on a rather magnificent scale, with excellent stagecraft and fine photographic effects". While the Winnipeg Free Press thought that the electrical equipment <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> suited to Buck Rogers, nonetheless the reviewer praised the film as [...] "exciting and sometimes morbidly gruesome", declaring that [...] "All who enjoyed Frankenstein will welcome his Bride as a worthy successor." [...] The New York Times called Karloff [...] "so splendid in the role that all one can say is 'he is the Monster. The Times praised the entire principal cast and Whale's direction in concluding that Bride is [...] "a first-rate horror film", and presciently suggested that [...] "The Monster should become an institution, like Charlie Chan."

[...] Grady Smith of Entertainment Weekly thought that the song's [...] "belty pop/rock wheelhouse" [...] should please fans of the sound. He later added that [...] "Clarkson <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> off releasing [...] "What Doesn’t Kill You" [...] as the first track from Stronger." [...] Another positive reception came from Glenn Gamboa of Newsday, who praised Clarkson for [...] "infusing her tales of empowerment after a breakup with her unique combo of vulnerability and sass." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant thought that the song is [...] "tailor-made for radio play" [...] and that [...] "the chilly electro-pop that Greg Kurstin brings to the verses, suggests a top forty version of Robyn's [...] "Call Your Girlfriend" [...] (2010). On March 5, 2013, Billboard ranked the song at number two in its list of Top 100 American Idol Hits of All Time.

500|$|F.R. Leavis {{argued that}} Boswell's {{criticisms of the}} play – [...] "that [...] has no sense of the theatre, and worse, cannot present or {{conceive}} his themes dramatically" [...] – were [...] "obvious", and that Irene was a failure because Johnson's best poetry (such as The Vanity of Human Wishes) was [...] "a poetry of statement, exposition and reflection: nothing could be remoter from the Shakespearean use of language [...] than the Johnsonian." [...] Like Eliot, Leavis suggested that the play <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> if Johnson had not been determined to write it in blank verse:He is clearly determined that his verse shall not be changed into the 'periods of a declaimer', and that it shall not {{be said that the}} audience cannot easily perceive 'where the lines end or begin' (see his remarks on blank-verse in the Life of Milton). [...] In couplets, of course, he couldn't have written so dismally. [...] With the absence of rhyme and of the movement goes the absence of wit. [...] And without the wit he is without the Johnsonian weight. Johnson biographer Walter Jackson Bate has attempted to defend Irene, arguing that the reason why it is considered so bad is that the reader cannot help being aware that [...] "it is by one of the masters of English prose style (who also had a powerful command of one kind of poetic style), and it is also by one of the supreme critics of literature in whatever language". Bate claims that if contemporary readers were able to encounter the play without knowing who had written it, [...] "it would not seem too bad"; but since we cannot forget Johnson's achievements in other fields of literature, reading Irene is an especially depressing experience: [...] "the heart begins after a while to sink except in the most resolute Johnsonian, and sometimes even then." ...|$|E
500|$|The obverse of {{the half}} dollar depicts Liberty, who is {{scattering}} fruits and flowers from a cornucopia held by a small, nude child. Behind them, the sun sets beyond San Francisco's Golden Gate, as yet unadorned by its bridge. Tom La Marre, in his 1987 article on the Panama–Pacific issue, pointed out that miners regarded the Golden Gate {{as a sign of}} good luck, and suggested it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> to depict it on a gold coin. The cornucopia, according to Burdette, demonstrates the advancement in trade brought by the canal, though the 1915 Report of the Director of the Mint states it [...] "signif the boundless resources of the West". [...] The obverse is based on Barber's earlier work, especially his medals for the annual Assay Commission. A representation of waves lies between the sun and the date, representing the maritime themes of the exposition. San Francisco's mint mark, S, is {{to the left of the}} date. [...] The reverse depicts an eagle atop a Union shield, flanked by branches of olive, symbolizing peace, something Swiatek and Breen found ironic given the coin's issuance during World War I, and oak, the latter a choice which they were at a loss to explain. The 1915 Mint Director's report deemed the oak branch an [...] "emblem of strength". Burdette notes that Barber's original design flanked the shield with two dolphins, representing the two oceans joined by the canal, instead of branches, and speculates, [...] "McAdoo either did not understand the allegory, did not care for it, or simply did not like aquatic mammals on coins". McAdoo may also have been suffering from a surfeit of dolphins, as the dollar and octagonal $50 pieces bear them—the ones on the half dollar were removed and replaced by the branches.|$|E
500|$|NPR writer Linda Holmes {{challenged}} the show's assertions of female empowerment. Finding the episode itself [...] "silly {{and full of}} bad dialogue" [...] and [...] "cheesy more than offensive", Holmes questioned how a series about women whose conduct and appearance were micromanaged could simultaneously claim that those regimented women were uniformly empowered by the experience. She opined that [...] "you can shake a Bunny tail and be empowered, no argument. It depends on what's {{going on in the}} rest of your life. But shaking a Bunny tail isn't enough to demonstrate empowerment if {{you have to go to}} Eddie Cibrian or Hugh Hefner for help every time you have a problem, and having the right not to be slapped on the behind when you deliver a cocktail isn't exactly a societal advance on the order of universal suffrage." [...] The series, she concluded, <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> served had those involved positioned it as a camp soap opera and not tried to make a feminist statement. In concurrence, Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized Hefner's narration, deeming it as delusional and stupid, and criticize the series for its stance on feminism. She wrote, [...] "The show wants things both ways: to glamorize the Playboy 'lifestyle' from a male point of view and also to try to persuade us that, although Bunnydom had its hardships and rigors—no gum chewing, constant smiling—wearing an uncomfortable skimpy uniform and putting a poufy fake tail on your butt meant you held the keys to the universe." [...] Television Blend's Kelly West was much more optimistic about the episode, and asserted that [...] "The Playboy Club offers a lot of shiny things to look at, but beyond that, there is a story beginning to develop and characters that, while not quite as original as they are nice to look at, are interesting and charismatic enough to carry the series." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said the Playboy brand and the lifestyle portrayed in the series was dated and uninterestingm calling it a [...] "bad show, period. The writing was weak, the acting spotty and the sexism too ridiculous and obvious to comment on more than once." [...] Alan Pergament, former critic for The Buffalo News, said of the show that [...] "the truth is [...] should have been a pay-cable series because without the sex it is pretty boring and tame." ...|$|E
