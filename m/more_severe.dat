40|$|Alcohol {{dependence}} is a maladaptive {{pattern of}} substance use for period, which is characterized by tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, loss of control and craving. Burden on caregivers and disability in patients having Alcohol dependence has not received attention in research so far. This study measures the burden on caregivers and disability in patients having ADS. They were administered proforma to elicit socio-demographic details, Prasad's socioeconomic status scale. Burden Assessment Schedule (BAS), Indian Disability Evaluation and Assessment Scale (IDEAS) and Severity of Alcohol dependence was measured by Short Alcohol Dependence Data (SADD) Questionnaire. The burden and disability was assessed in this group. Burden experienced during the episode was significantly more during the episode than one month before the episode. There was significantly more burden during mixed episode than during manic and depressive episode. Burden was <b>more</b> in <b>severe</b> alcohol dependent patients than in mild and moderate dependent patients. Disability was significantly <b>more</b> in <b>severe</b> alcohol dependence than in moderate and mild dependence. There {{was no significant difference}} in the burden experienced by the caregivers of patients having ADS, alcohol induced psychosis and delirium tremorns. Burden experienced by the caregivers of the patients having severe dependence was significantly more than the caregivers of low and moderate alcohol dependence group.
