40|$|This study {{estimates}} the technical efficiency of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> in the north-eastern region of Thailand in 2007 {{by using a}} stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and technical inefficiency effects model. Data for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> in the north-eastern region can be categorized into three aspects: by aggregate <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs,</b> by size of SME, by selected three provinces in the north-eastern region. These categories are estimated individually to predict the technical efficiency and investigate whether technical efficiency is positively or negatively related to firm-specific factors. The empirical {{results indicate that the}} mean technical efficiency of all categories of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> in the north-eastern region is 43 percent, implying that <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> have high levels of technical inefficiency in their production process. <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> in the north-eastern region are labour intensive. The empirical results of the technical inefficiency effects model suggested that skilled labour, municipal area, ownership characteristics are found to be important firm-specific factors affecting the technical efficiency.

40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) Abstract: The South African <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SME</b> {{sector is}} {{recognised}} {{by many as}} a key driver of economic growth, employment and wealth creation. Despite {{the importance of the}} sector to South Africa’s economic development, the majority of South African <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SME’s</b> experience negative growth and severe losses. These losses include investment capital, property, staff competencies and intellectual capital. The purpose of this research is to identify the barriers that prevent the growth of South African <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SME’s.</b> A mixed research method which is a combination of qualitative and quantitative was used to gather data. A sample size of 8 SME’s was selected via purposive sampling or judgmental sampling techniques for the qualitative phase. The quantitative sample includes 61 <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SME’s</b> located in the industrial area of Randburg, which is located in Strijdom Park. The data was collected using structured questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The information was analysed with SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) as well as applying the content analysis technique to identify barriers to growth facing <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SME’s.</b> The study concludes that there are several internal and external economic, political, social and competitive barriers that prevent the growth and sustainability of the majority of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SME’s</b> in the Randburg CBD. The lack of access to finance, high taxes and tariffs, and crime are amongst the most common barriers that hamper <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SME’s</b> to grow in this area. The findings also revealed that an increase of government investment in the sector can improve the start-up, growth and competitiveness of the sector. This would enhance job creation significantly, as a high percentage (above 65 %) of employment in South Africa comes from the SME sector...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} as {{an investigation into}} what prevents South African <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SME’s</b> from contributing more to South Africa’s export performance. To this end a literature review was conducted to, among others, identify barriers to exports faced by <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SME’s</b> contained in existing literature. A number of core groupings were identified. Empirical research was then conducted by telephonically interviewing 499 <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SME’s</b> to gain insight into prevalence of exporters, interested nonexporters and not interested non-exporters. Exporting respondents were asked what their biggest export facilitating factor was, and what the one thing was they felt each {{of the government and}} third party facilitators could do to assist in the export process. Non-exporting respondents were further asked for reasons for not exporting (if they wanted to export) as well as reasons for not wanting to export, as the case may be. Strong demographic differences emerged between exporters, interested nonexporters and not interested non-exporters. A number of factors emerged as to barriers and facilitators to exports and how the government and third party facilitators might assist in the export process. These insights could be used to tailor export promotion initiatives. Dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010. Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) unrestricte...|$|R

This thesis examines how the Internet relates to <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> and reviews how <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> internationalise. In particular, this thesis concerns how industrial networks/relationships impact {{on the use of the}} Internet for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> and their international operations. This thesis reviews relevant areas of literature in industrial network perspectives, internationalisation, capabilities and the Internet. A conceptual framework derived from the literature review is also presented. The conceptual development provides a framework for the subsequent research strategies. The empirical data consists of ten in-depth case studies from different types of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> and industries within the UK. A cross-case analysis was then carried out which leads to the finalised framework. One of the key contributions of this thesis is the development of the SCIM (SME Capability for the Internationalisation of Manufacturing) framework. The framework provides an overview of an industrial network in relation to the manufacturing SMEs' capability development, and factors such as the Internet and industrial environment that need to be considered for their international business decisions. The findings reveal key components that have direct impact upon <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> when engaging in network business activities. Moreover, the findings elaborate the influence of the Internet for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> for their international business operations and internationalisation strategies.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} and develop what set of skills a design leader require and if these differentiate them from the generic leader in SME organisations. Theory: The themes and concepts we have based the research on is first and foremost design leadership and skills. We have utilised studies by for example: Miller and Moultrie (2013), Joziasse (2011), Turner (2013) and Mumford et al. (2007) in order to develop an extensive theoretical framework.   Methodology: We have approached this research in a deductive and qualitative manner through a descriptive and somewhat exploratory design. We have conducted six semi-structured interviews with leaders at <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SME</b> organisations in ‘Småland’. Conclusion:  Through this research we have established a set of skills that a design leader requires in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SME</b> organisations. In conclusion we found that the design leader requires well developed generic leadership skills in form of; learn/adapt, speak (convey information), listen (attentive), motivate, inspire, analyse, manage, problem solve, project manage, observe, plan and apprise as well as design specific skills; draw, synthesize, envision-imagine-visualise, edit, design and employ technology. We also identified the difference between the design leader and generic leader, whereby we found a slight difference, even though most generic leaders interviewed utilise aspects of design leadership due to positions interlinking. On top of this we tried to clarify what a design leader really is in these types of organisations, as this was found to be slightly vague in previous literature. ...|$|R

40|$|Thai <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> {{have played}} a major role in {{increasing}} the Thai GDP and improving international competitiveness. However, there have been many problems inside organisations that have created obstacles to improving performance in both domestic and international markets. Thailand has entered into FTAs with several international trading groups, and has thus been confronted by fierce overseas competitors. However, Thai <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> have lacked investment in modern technology and management techniques. There appears to be a need for Quality Management (QM) that benefits from well-managed Human Factors (HFs). Over the past decade, Total Quality Management (TQM) has been used by many larger Thai enterprises, but there has been a slow up-take in Thai <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs.</b> This PhD work has studied 71 Thai <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> in relation to Human Factors - dependent Quality Management Systems (QMSs). These were in three distinct industry groups; Food and Beverage, Automotive and Auto parts, and Textiles and Garments. In a substantial literature review, 300 references have been consulted. This review showed that management issues were critical in Thai manufacturing SME’s. Quality Management in particular is largely problematical and a better understanding of the role of human factors is urgently required. Human Factors considered are derived from the seven criteria of the Thailand Quality Award (TQA) and were used as the basis of a questionnaire survey. These were:- Strategic Human Resource Planning, Human Resource Development, Employee Empowerment, Performance Management, Communication and Information Management, Leadership, and Continuous Improvement. In analysing the results of the investigation, ten hypotheses were explored. The most important conclusions were:- • The importance of human factors problems in Thai <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> is significant (α = 0. 05). • Thai <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> that had implemented TQM had established Organisational Aspects, Performance Management, Leadership and QM training that are different to those that had not implemented TQM. (∝ = 0. 05). • The level of TQM adoption is not significantly related to the need to upgrade organisational performance, morale, work satisfaction, and work participation. There are significant relationships between morale and work satisfaction (α = 0. 05) and work participation and work satisfaction (α = 0. 05). • The extent of human factors problems in Food and Beverage industries is significantly different from other industries (α = 0. 10). • Technology-intensive Thai <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> have more highly developed quality management than those that are Labour-intensive (α = 0. 01) and also established better performance management systems (α = 0. 05). • The outcomes of this research relating to the current status of TQM implementation are useful for Thai <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> considering their problems because their interest in the results of this study was up to 72 % (α = 0. 05). • Government assistance programmes were considered by many Thai <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> to be unproductive. Less than 70 % of Thai <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> had requested help from government to solve their human factors problems (α = 0. 05). In addition, there were perceived gaps between their needs and their conscious need for government assistance (α = 0. 05). Therefore, a new approach is required to fill this gap by establishing a productive quality management system. A SWOT analysis was used to identify Strengths and Weaknesses and examine Opportunities and Threats to Thai <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs.</b> It concluded that Thai <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> should consider Human Factors as a major issue in establishing an effective Quality Management System. Three models were developed in this study. The first addresses the main five problems; Quality Practices, Human Resources, Management Functions and Operational Tasks, Basic Infrastructure and Organisational Aspects, and Related Problems which influenced the successful implementation of QM. In response to these, the two other models, Government Assistance Strategies and the Development of a Quality Management System specifically addressing the Human Resource in Thai <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs,</b> have been established. It is concluded that government assistance strategies are necessary to assist Thai <b>manufacturing</b> <b>SMEs</b> in five areas; (1) Communication, Information and Education, (2) Provision of Effective SME Development programmes, (3) Improvement of Work Systems, (4) Establishment of Basic Infrastructure, and (5) Development of Quality Management Systems.
