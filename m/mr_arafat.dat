40|$|The Palestinian Question is a {{centuries old}} problem which at {{different}} stages of history has involved different nations and civilizations. The strategic position of the territory of Palestine, and the location of Holy Shrines belonging to three principal religions of the world, namely Islam, Christianity and Judaism, have been the main factors responsible for the contention among the Christians, Muslims and Jews over the land of Palestine. The Palestinian Problem in the modern sense starts with the capture of the territory by the British during the First World War and issuance of Balfour Declaration on November 2, 1917 pledging to establish a Jewish National Horne in Palestine. Before that Palestine was under the suzerainty of Ottoman Empire but after the defeat of Turkey, the British were entrusted the control over Palestine under the Mandate system of the League of Nations. During the Mandate period (1922 - 1948) the British endeavoured to convert Palestine into a National Home for Jews as promised by them under the Bal four Declaration. For this purpose, they allowed large scale immigration of Jews into Palestine. This was opposed by the Palestinian Arabs who constituted more than two third majority of the population of Palestine, with the resultant outbreaks of Arab revolts against the British rule over Palestine The British crushed the revolts in a ruthless manner {{with the help of the}} Jews. The atrocities perpetrated on the Palestinian Arabs provoked resentment and condemnation throughout the Arab and Muslim World including the Muslims of South Asia who were strongly linked with the land of Palestine on the basis of common religion, culture and history. In 1948 Palestine was partitioned in accordance with a resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, and the state of Israel was set up. The Western Powers, particularly the United States who had vital strategic and economic interests in the Middle East played crucial role in the establishment of Jewish state of Israel. The Western Powers continued to finance, arm and provide other assistance to the Israelis, as a result of. Which they were able to defeat the Arab armies in the First Arab-Israel War of 1948. The principles on which Pakistan's policy towards Arab Israel Conflict is based have been formulated by such factors as geographical contiguity, common religion, traditional, cultural links and considerations of economic benefit and political support in her disputes with India. These principles have largely remained unchanged, but there have been variations due to Pakistan's security links with the Western Powers, especially the United States who have been principal supporters of Israel against the Arabs. In mid- 1950 s, Pakistan allied herself with the Western Powers by joining SEATO and Baghdad Pact (later CENTO). It was the security pressure from India and Afghanistan which compelled Pakistan to join these military pacts, but the military alliance with the West led to a divergence of perception of the nature and implications of the Arab-Israel Conflict between Pakistan and the Arabs. This divergence sharpened during the 1956 Suez Crisis. As a results Pakistan lost much of the Arab good will that she had earned in the earlier years by openly supporting the Arabs against Israel and her Western patrons. Thus, an important objective of Pakistan's policy towards the Arab-Israel Conflict, namely to win Arab political and moral support in disputes with India, suffered a serious set back. In June, 1967 the third Arab-Israel War broke out. In this war Israel captured large territories belonging to Egypt, Jordan and Syria, including Jerusalem. The occupation of Arab territories and Jerusalem gave new dimension to the Palestinian Problem. The occupation and subsequent annexation of Jerusalem by Israel created great resentment and bitterness in the Muslim world. The firing incident at the Holy Mosque al-Aqsa caused further anguish among the Muslims throughout the world. These developments led to the holding First Islamic Summit at Rabat in September, 1969 which decided to mobilize world public opinion to force Israel to relinquish her occupation of Arab territories and Jerusalem. The Summit also decided to extend full support to the Palestinian Liberation organization as the legitimate and sole representative organization of the Palestinian people. Pakistan extended full support to the Arab states attacked by Israel in the June, 1967 War. The Government of Pakistan even offered material assistance to Egypt, Syria and Jordan. On the question of occupied Arab territories, Jerusalem and al-Aqsa, the Government of Pakistan fully endorsed the Arab stand. The convergence of perception of the Arab-Israel Conflict between Pakistan and the Arab states that grew during and after 1967 War was due to the weakening of military pacts which, previously, put a constraint on Pakistan's foreign policy. But, a shi ft in the US foreign policy under Kennedy Administration, the development of Super-Power Detente and the attitude of the United States during the 1962 Sino-Indian border war, compelled Pakistan to distance herself away from the military pacts like SEATO and CENTO. The growth of close and friendly relations between Pakistan and China, and improvement in bilateral relationships between Pakistan, and the Arab countries were the symbols of Pakistan's independent and (practically) nonaligned foreign policy. Under this policy Pakistan was able to take more independent stand on the Palestinian Question as it is evident from. Pakistan's representative performance at the United Nations and other international forums. In October, 1973, the fourth war between the Arabs and Israel broke out. The war had become inevitable because of Israeli refusal to vacate the occupied Arab territories and Jerusalem. In this war the combined forces of Egypt and Syria achieve some important tactical victories in the initial phases of the war. But their military gains were thwarted by huge US arms airlift to Israel after two weeks of intense fighting. Angered by the American arms supply to Israel, the Arab countries resorted to an embargo on the oil supplies to the Western nations. Shah Faisal of Saudi Arabia played a leading role in the oil Embargo which ultimately forced the Jewish State to enter into two disengagement of Forces agreements with Egypt on the Canal front. Pakistan expressed complete sokidarity with the Arabs during 1973 October War. The Government of Pakistan provided not only material assistance to the Arabs, the Prime Minister of Pakistan Z. A. Bhutto toured a number of Arab and non-Arab Muslim countries to mobilize political and diplomatic support to the Arabs on a broadly based united front of the entire Muslim world. Pakistan's policy during the 1973 October War was greatly appreciated by the Arab countries. This was evident from the speeches and statements of the Arab leaders, including the chairman of P. L. O, <b>Mr.</b> Yasser <b>Arafat,</b> who participated in the Second (Lahore) Summit of Islamic countries held at Lahore in February, 1974. Pakistan not only supported the Arab's war against Israel, she also endorsed the use of oil weapon by the Arabs against the Western countries. The pursuit of such an independent policy by Pakistan was due to further weakening of country's links with the western countries through military pacts, especially after the separation of East Pakistan which led to Pakistan dissociation from SEATO...|$|R
40|$|The {{stakes are}} very high, {{not just for}} Mr. Yasser Arafat's {{political}} survival but, more important, {{for the future of}} the Palestinians. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Arafat</b> confronts daunting tasks in responding to Hamas' bloody methods and in seizing the political initiative from the seasoned and effective Islamists. In the final analysis and regardless of the brutality of the Israeli military occupation, Hamas and Islamic Jihad have done considerable damage to the legitimate Palestinian cause, internally and externally. Their strategy of establishing a 'balance of terror' with the right-wing government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has been costly to Palestinians and Israelis alike and counterproductive as well. Mr. Sharon feels emboldened with a popular mandate to invade Palestinian-controlled territory and threatens to destroy the Palestinian Authority and the prospects for genuine peace. Despite his waning popularity, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Arafat</b> is still viewed as a powerful symbol of Palestinian nationalism and retains a deep residue of support within Palestinian society. He can be most effective by using the symbols of Palestinian nationalism to redefine the political debate less as a zero sum game, as Hamas and Islamic Jihad would like the Palestinians to believe, and more as a give-and-take bargaining process...|$|E
40|$|There are two {{narratives}} {{about what}} happened in the Clinton-Assad summit in Geneva. Ours - the only one heard in Israel (and on CNN) - is that Assad just doesn't want peace. "The masks have been unveiled", said Barak, "the Syrian position is not ripe for the decisions which are necessary in order to reach a peace treaty". Assad is insisting on those 500 meters in order to humiliate us and derail the process. The second narrative can be witnessed in Robert Fisk's report in the British "Independent": "The two men held three hours of talks, through interpreters, at the Intercontinental Hotel in Geneva, with the Syrian leader patiently explaining {{he was not going to}} fall into the same 'peace' trap as the Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat.

40|$|YOUR correspondent, a {{dedicated}} student {{of letters to}} the papers, {{reached the end of}} his tether again recently, this time at yet another letter of abuse and factual error about the refugees. Racist certainly, and wrong; it should never have been published. It isn’t the first letter that a newspaper should not have published, nor will it be the last. But there is a question here that seems to have escaped notice: why don’t serious newspapers correct errors that appear in published letters? They correct errors that occur elsewhere in the paper. Are letters so unimportant? Of course not. Letter writers in the main are dealing with current affairs, and what they say has an influence. Why else would organisations and individuals try so hard, and sometimes by trickery, to have their letters published? The publicity staff of Sir Robert Askin had more than a thousand letters published by various stratagems while he was premier of New South Wales, according to his then press secretary, Mr Geoffrey Reading. The papers have tightened up since then, but no system is foolproof. The problem about letters is not opinion. The problem is the facts. Any factual errors in a mass-circulation newspaper are horribly magnified by the circulation figures. But I can think of only one notable exception to this special charter that would seem to tolerate errors in published letters, and that is where the risk of a libel writ crops up. Then there may be action. Thus, last March The Sydney Morning Herald acknowledged that some very nasty statements about Mr Chris Corrigan in a letter were untrue, and apologised for publishing it. Well and good. But there are sometimes errors of much greater public consequence that go uncorrected. Yes, on occasion another correspondent will take up the mistake, but that can’t be relied upon to happen, and in any case such a letter may simply be seen by readers as disputatious rather than authoritatively corrective. TO ILLUSTRATE the significance of such errors, here is a particular case. It requires some explanation. It concerns letters about the Israel–Palestine confrontation. These have filled many columns since the meeting at Camp David in July 2000, attended by the (then) Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Barak, and the Palestinian president, <b>Mr</b> <b>Arafat,</b> with President Clinton in America’s usual irreconcilable roles of mediator and supporter of Israel. Camp David of course failed, and this failure to reach agreement has been widely dumped on <b>Mr</b> <b>Arafat.</b> Last December, 18 months after Camp David, the Australian was still describing him as the man who “spurned” a peace agreement at Camp David. As recently as March the Australian, was still pursuing him. But was <b>Mr</b> <b>Arafat</b> the villain? That is how he has been painted by unrelenting Israeli propaganda: a man who rejected an amazingly generous peace offer because his real objective is not a peace treaty between two nations but the destruction of Israel. If the American media had been up to the task, it would have ferreted out the facts at the time. As it is, it has taken a long time for something informed and reliable to register in parts of the mainstream media here. Long enough, it seems, for a myth to have been created, which some people will stick with, regardless. The letters pages have in my view played a significant part in the establishing of this myth. Here is its succinct expression by a correspondent in the Adelaide Advertiser, who referred to Mr Arafat’s “refusal to accept Barak’s offer giving him 98 per cent of what Arafat demanded”. Nonsense, of course, but it was published. A correspondent in the Age says that “Barak’s ‘peace for land’ proposal offered the Palestinians 97 per cent of their land claims [...] including half of the Old City of Jerusalem”. To this a correspondent in the Australian adds as part of the Israeli offer a “limited ‘right of return’ to Palestinian refugees”. A correspondent in the Sydney Morning Herald shakes his head sadly, but seems unaware of the facts: “The Palestinians were offered a state by the UN in 1947 and again by Israel in 2000. It is a great tragedy for the Palestinian people that their leaders were not prepared to accept either. ” The letter writers were hardly alone. In early April, in a public statement, Australia’s Prime Minister left no room for doubt: I remain mortified that a couple of years ago, the offer [of Mr Barak], which was about 80 or 90 per cent of what the Palestinians wanted, was not accepted. The biggest error, mistake [...] the greatest area of condemnation [...] of Arafat was his failure back in the year 2000 to accept the offer Barak was making then. With all the resources available to him, how could Mr Howard be so wrong? AS FAR back as August 8, 2001, Robert Malley, writing in the New York Times under the heading “Fictions About the Failure at Camp David”, exploded what he described as the three most dangerous myths about that failure. As President Clinton’s special assistant for Arab-Israeli Affairs (1998 - 2001), Mr Malley was at Camp David, a member of the small American team. What follows now is a summarised version of his article. Myth One says Camp David was an ideal test of Mr Arafat’s intentions. Not so at all. <b>Mr</b> <b>Arafat</b> believed Camp David premature [...] Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had not sufficiently narrowed the gaps beforehand [...] and he felt isolated from the Arab world and alienated by the close Israeli-American partnership. He believed that Mr Barak was trying to avoid commitments, including a long-postponed Israeli withdrawal from parts of the West Bank and the transfer to Palestinian control of villages adjacent to Jerusalem. Mr Malley himself doubted that a conflict with roots so ancient could ever have been resolved, in the fortnight set aside, without the core issues of territory, refugees, and the future of Jerusalem ever having been discussed previously by the leaders. Myth Two says Israel’s offer met most if not all of the Palestinians’ legitimate aspirations. Well, Mr Barak did go further than any of his predecessors had gone. But to the Palestinians it was no dream offer. Israel was to annex 9 per cent of the West Bank for the settlers; in return, the Palestinians would get land from Israel equivalent to only one-ninth of the territory lost. In Jerusalem, Palestine would have gained sovereignty over many Arab districts of the eastern half, and over the Muslim and Christian quarters of the Old City. But Israel would have sovereignty over some Arab sections of East Jerusalem, and over what Jews know as the Temple Mount and the Arabs as Haram al Sharif, the site of Islam’s third-holiest shrine for the past 1300 years. The Arabs would have only the custody of Haram al Sharif, something impossible for them to accept. 	 For all the importance to Palestinians of the future of the refugees, Israel’s offer spoke only vaguely of a “satisfactory solution”, which led <b>Mr</b> <b>Arafat</b> to fear that he would be asked to swallow an unacceptable last-minute proposal. Myth Three says the Palestinians made no concession of their own. This was quite untrue. They wanted a state based on the 1967 borders, but nevertheless agreed to give up West Bank territory to the settlement blocks. In East Jerusalem, there are Jewish areas that became Israeli-ruled only by conquest in the Six-day War of 1967, and these areas the Palestinians agreed to forgo. They insisted on the refugees’ right of return, but accepted that numbers would be limited in a way that ensured Israel’s demographic and security interests. Mr Malley: “No other Arab party that has negotiated with Israel [...] not Anwar el-Sadat’s Egypt, not King Hussein’s Jordan, let alone Hafez al-Assad’s Syria [...] ever came close to even considering such compromises. ” The measure of Israel’s concessions ought not, Mr Malley wrote, to be how far it has moved from its own starting point; it must be how far it has moved toward a fair solution. In the Malley view, neither <b>Mr</b> <b>Arafat</b> nor Mr Barak met their historic responsibilities at the summit, and <b>Mr</b> <b>Arafat</b> missed some chances. But clearly Mr Malley rejects the propaganda that <b>Mr</b> <b>Arafat</b> any more than Mr Barak was to blame for the outcome. The Malley account is a limited one; {{but the point is that}} he was there. To this one can add something from Palestinian sources. They calculate that Mr Barak’s offer would have left them at the best with 15 per cent of pre-Israel Palestine. At present, the West Bank and Gaza total 22 per cent of the original territory. A generous offer? The notion is absurd. The proposed state of Palestine would have comprised four enclaves, cut up by settlements and by roads for Jews only. Palestine would have been a fragmented state, one in name only, without control over its borders, its air space and its water resources. A generous offer? A new intifada was the desperate sequel. Nevertheless, attempts to reach a settlement did not end with Camp David; some progress seems to have been made later, but no deal was reached before the advent of Mr Sharon brought a sledgehammer to the Palestinian anvil. WHAT has all this to do with letters to the papers? A good deal, really. Letters have been published with false or at best misleading statements about something of high importance. Propaganda has been given a kick along. Should such letters be published? Some people may look on the letters pages as a special case, where readers don’t expect the usual editorial standards. I take the view that in matters of fact there is no room for two editorial standards. Letters editors, good letters editors, need almost superhuman qualities to cope with the great range of affairs that threaten to overwhelm them daily. If they do not have the resources to carry out all the vital checking and liaison work needed, should they not be given them? And if significant errors in letters get into print, should they not be corrected as other errors are, and repetition be avoided? • David Bowman is a former editor-in-chief of the Sydney Morning Herald.

40|$|AbstractThe late {{president}} of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat, died in November 2004 in Percy Hospital, one month after having experienced a sudden onset of symptoms that included severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain and which were followed by multiple organ failure. In spite of numerous investigations performed in France, the pathophysiological mechanisms at {{the origin of the}} symptoms could not be identified. In 2011, we found abnormal levels of polonium- 210 (210 Po) in some of Arafat's belongings that were worn during his final hospital stay and which were stained with biological fluids. This finding led to the exhumation of Arafat's remains in 2012. Significantly higher (up to 20 times) activities of 210 Po and lead- 210 (210 Pb) were found in the ribs, iliac crest and sternum specimens compared to reference samples from the literature (p-value < 1 %). In all specimens from the tomb, 210 Po activity was supported by a similar activity of 210 Pb. Biokinetic calculations demonstrated that a 210 Pb impurity, as identified in a commercial source of 3 MBq of 210 Po, may be responsible for the activities measured in Arafat's belongings and remains 8 years after his death. The absence of myelosuppression and hair loss in Mr Arafat's case compared to Mr Litvinenko's, the only known case of malicious poisoning with 210 Po, could be explained by differences in the time delivery-scheme of intake. In conclusion, statistical Bayesian analysis combining all the evidence gathered in our forensic expert report moderately supports the proposition that <b>Mr</b> <b>Arafat</b> was poisoned by 210 Po...|$|E
