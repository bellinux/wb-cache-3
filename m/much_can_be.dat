These documents relate to the properties held by the schola sacerdotum (a school for priests) he is credited with founding in Verona. There are several other charters or documents claimed to have been written or signed by Pacificus, but their authenticity is currently a matter of debate. In addition there are several marginalia believed to have been written by Pacificus on manuscripts from Church's Veronese archives, as well as numerous manuscripts attributed to him.|$|E

Approximately ten percent of the known runestones announce the travels and deaths of men abroad.

The clerestory and triforium were combined into a single arch with the main arcade below. The presbytery's high vault was executed in stone with bosses decorated in red and white paint and gold leaf, traces of which were still visible when several of the bosses were found in the 19th century. The eastern bay of the presbytery was divided into several chapels and the remnants of parclose screens are visible on the main aisle's north and south responds.
