This allows the driver (or guard) to find out in which coach the ACP actually occurred. When the coach is isolated, the lever needs to be manually reset. Until this is done, the lamp and buzzer in the locomotive cab are continuously activated. A circuit breaker controls the lamp and alarm bell in the locomotive cab; in cases where defective equipment causes the lamp and bell to go off, the driver can disable them by placing the <b>MCB</b> (<b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker)</b> in the [...] "Off" [...] position. Despite the obvious safety hazards, sometimes this is resorted to by drivers when driving trains through sections where spurious ACP incidents are very common.|$|E

This team is going to improve the Pre-wiring and Preparation Station of SM 6 line using some effective methods, for examples: video analysis, layout improvement, process description improvement, and reduces spaces needed for Pre-wiring and Preparation Station. Based on the analysis that has been performed, the efficiency for Switch and CB can be increased until 81. 5 % and 78. 8 % from the current condition (based on only one sample of data).

50|$|The {{first problem}} is {{resolved}} {{by the use of}} circuit breakers—devices that can be reset after they have broken current flow. In modern systems that use less than about 10 kW, <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> are typically used. These devices combine the mechanism that initiates the trip (by sensing excess current) as well as the mechanism that breaks the current flow in a single unit. Some <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> operate {{solely on the basis of}} electromagnetism. In these <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers,</b> the current is run through a solenoid, and, in the event of excess current flow, the magnetic pull of the solenoid is sufficient to force open the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker's</b> contacts (often indirectly through a tripping mechanism). A better design however arises by inserting a bimetallic strip before the solenoid—this means that instead of always producing a magnetic force, the solenoid only produces a magnetic force when the current is strong enough to deform the bimetallic strip and complete the solenoid's circuit.|$|R

40|$|The {{electric}} arc in current limiting <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> is often {{depicted as a}} well defined region of current flow. During a short circuit fault the current through the arc in a current limiting <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> can range from 100 to 10000 Amps.

Modern installations may use residual-current devices (RCDs) or residual current breakers with overcurrent protection (RCBOs).

25|$|An early form of <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> was {{described}} by Thomas Edison in an 1879 patent application, although his commercial power distribution system used fuses. Its purpose was to protect lighting circuit wiring from accidental short circuits and overloads. A modern <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> {{similar to the ones}} now in use was patented by Brown, Boveri & Cie in 1924. Hugo Stotz, an engineer who had sold his company to BBC, was credited as the inventor on DRP (Deutsches Reichspatent) 458392. Stotz's invention was the forerunner of the modern thermal-magnetic breaker commonly used in household load centers to this day.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} EMC {{issue was}} lightning strike (lightning electromagnetic pulse, or LEMP) on buildings. Lightning rods or lightning conductors {{began to appear}} in the mid-18th century. With the advent of widespread electricity generation and power supply lines from the late 19th century on, problems also arose with equipment short-circuit failure affecting the power supply, and with local fire and shock hazard when the power line was struck by lightning. Power stations were provided with output <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers.</b> Buildings and appliances would soon be provided with input fuses, and later in the 20th century <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> (<b>MCB)</b> would come into use.|$|R
25|$|Low-voltage <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> (<b>MCB)</b> use air {{alone to}} {{extinguish}} the arc.

By splitting the arc into smaller arcs the arc is cooled down while the arc voltage is increased and serves as an additional impedance which limits the current through the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker.</b> The current-carrying parts near the contacts provide easy deflection of the arc into the arc chutes by a magnetic force of a current path, although magnetic blowout coils or permanent magnets could also deflect the arc into the arc chute (used on <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> for higher ratings).So The number of plates in the arc chute {{is dependent on the}} short-circuit rating and nominal voltage of the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> and fuses may {{be rated}} to {{interrupt}} {{as little as}} 85 amperes and are intended for supplementary protection of equipment, not the primary protection of a building wiring system. In North American practice, approved general-purpose low-voltage fuses must interrupt at least 10,000 amperes and certain types useful for large commercial and industrial low-voltage distribution systems are rated to safely interrupt 200,000 amperes. The rating of power <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> varies according to the application voltage; a <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> that interrupts 50,000 amperes at 208 volts might be rated to interrupt only 10,000 amperes at 600 volts, for example.
