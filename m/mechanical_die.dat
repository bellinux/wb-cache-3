40|$|A {{method of}} direct lipid {{analysis}} by MALDI mass spectrometry in intact membranes, without prior extraction/separation steps, is described. The purple membrane {{isolated from the}} extremely halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum was selected as model membrane. Lyophilized purple membrane were grinded with 9 -aminoacridine (9 -AA) as dry matrix, and the powder mixture was crushed in a <b>mechanical</b> <b>die</b> press to form a thin pellet. Small pieces of the pellet were then attached to the MALDI target and directly analyzed. In parallel, individual archaebacterial phospholipids and glycolipids, together with the total lipid extract of the purple membrane, were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS using 9 -AA as the matrix in solution. Results show that 9 -AA represents a suitable matrix for the conventional MALDI-TOF/MS analysis of lipid extracts from archaeal microorganisms, {{as well as for}} fast and reliable direct dry lipid analysis of lyophilized archaebacterial membranes. This method might be of general application, offering the advantage of quickly gaining information about lipid components without disrupting or altering the membrane matrix...|$|E

40|$|High-pressure {{die-casting}} {{is widely}} used in the automotive field {{for the possibility of}} obtaining net to shape components of complex geometry and thin wall thickness at high production rates. A number of process parameters exists, which, if not adequately determined and adjusted, result in a decadence of quality of the die cast part. Common defects in die castings are shrinkage cavities, cold fills, oxide skins, dross, entrapped air bubbles. It’s common opinion that defects can make the mechanical behaviour of castings unpredictable. The influence of casting defects on the <b>mechanical</b> properties of <b>die</b> cast aluminium alloys is described below. Castings with thin sections, like those produced by high-pressure die-casting, are vulnerable to the effect of defects since a single macro-defect can cover a significant fraction of the cross-section area.

40|$|Aluminum {{die casting}} is an {{important}} manufacturing process for <b>mechanical</b> components. <b>Die</b> casting {{is known to be}} more accurate than other types of casting; however, post-machining is usually necessary to achieve the required accuracy. The goal of this investigation is to develop machining- free aluminum die casting. Improvement of the accuracy of planar and cylindrical parts is expected by correcting metal molds. In the proposed method, the shape of cast aluminum made with the initial metal molds is measured by 3 D scanning. The 3 D scan data includes information about deformations that occur during casting. Therefore, it is possible to estimate the deformation and correction amounts by comparing 3 D scan data with product computer-aided design (CAD) data. We corrected planar and cylindrical parts of the CAD data for the mold. In addition, we corrected the planar part of the metal mold using the corrected mold data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by evaluating the accuracy improvement of the cast aluminum made with the corrected mold...|$|R
