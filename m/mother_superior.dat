5|$|By 1858, Malo-Galipeau {{had become}} widely {{recognised}} as foundress of the Misericordia Sisters, {{partly due to}} her role as <b>Mother</b> <b>Superior</b> and {{partly due to the}} endowment she had brought to the community upon her arrival. This understanding was reflected in published works of the time, including a souvenir album prepared by the City of Montreal in 1853. However, during Bourget's visit to the Institute in late 1858, he made a speech to the assembled community confirming that in the eyes of himself and of the Church, Cadron-Jetté should receive credit as the foundress of the congregation. He also bestowed upon Cadron-Jetté the title of Mother (such that her religious name became Mother Mary of the Nativity, or Mère de la Nativité) and confirmed that she was second in authority only to the current <b>Mother</b> <b>Superior</b> of the community.|$|E

25|$|The Pope {{is elected}} by the College of Cardinals. Women are not {{appointed}} as cardinals, and therefore women cannot vote for the Pope. The female Catholic offices of Abbess or <b>Mother</b> <b>Superior</b> are elective, the choice being made by the secret votes of the nuns belonging to the community.|$|E

25|$|Raquella has {{reestablished}} {{her school}} on Wallach IX in Mentats of Dune (2014), {{thanks to the}} help of industrialist Josef Venport. Valya, now a Reverend Mother, retrieves the hidden computers from Rossak and hopes to succeed the declining Raquella as <b>Mother</b> <b>Superior.</b> Raquella believes that the only hope for the Sisterhood to survive is for the Wallach IX sisters to reconcile with Dorotea's faction on Salusa Secundus; her health failing, she summons Dorotea to the School and forces Dorotea and Valya to put their differences aside and agree to work together {{for the good of}} the Sisterhood. Naming them co-leaders, Raquella dies; Valya however, still bitter about Dorotea's betrayal, uses her newly discovered power of Voice to force Dorotea to commit suicide. Valya declares herself to be the sole <b>Mother</b> <b>Superior,</b> and ingratiates herself to the new Emperor, Roderick Corrino.|$|E

25|$|During the war, Wheelwright {{had been}} {{assistant}} superior as the Ursulines nursed both French and British {{soldiers in the}} convent. On December 15, 1760, Esther Wheelwright was appointed <b>Mother</b> <b>Superior</b> of the Quebec Ursuline order. In part due to her respected personality, this was also a strategic move by the Order, as her English and Protestant heritage was crucial to maintaining the Ursulines' position and independence under British rule.|$|E
50|$|The two-storeyed Abbey House {{was built}} between 1826-1828 with the {{financial}} support of Czar Alexander I, after {{his visit to the}} convent in October 1824. The <b>Mother</b> <b>Superior's</b> residence is a protected monument (currently uncategorized).|$|R

25|$|Pedro Almodóvar (b.1949) is a Spanish film director, screenwriter, {{producer}} and former actor who was reared as Catholic. He is openly gay.

25|$|As <b>Mother</b> <b>Superior,</b> Esther {{functioned as}} a diplomat, {{maintaining}} {{good relations with the}} British Governors of Québec Amherst and Murray, as well as with France. During the negotiations for the Québec Act of 1774, her diplomacy with Governor Guy Carleton proved influential. The convent was central to the City of Québec, both in location and in relation to the British. Right after the defeat of Québec in 1759, General Murray established both a British military hospital and Québec's first Anglican church in the convent.|$|E
50|$|In 1275, the Order {{also had}} six convents for nuns, who called {{themselves}} the <b>Mothers</b> <b>Superior.</b> The wives and {{family of the}} friars could stay there {{when they went to}} war or died. The friars only professed conjugal chastity, but not everlasting, and because of this they could leave the convent and marry. The convents that are mentioned are: Santa Eufemia de Cozuelos (Palencia), founded in 1502; Convento de Sancti Spiritus of Salamanca, given to the Order in 1233; San Vicente de Junqueras (Barcelona), founded in 1212; San Pedro de la Piedra (1260), in Lérida; Santos-o-Velho (1194), in Lisbon and the Destiana (León). The convents of Membrilla (Ciudad Real) and the <b>Mothers</b> <b>Superior</b> of Madrid (1650) came after these dates.|$|R

[...] "And I {{should have}} small respect indeed for the {{religious}} convictions {{of any one}} who could hear the story of that wooden cross, and not feel that the <b>Mother</b> <b>Superior's</b> name {{for it is the}} very best that could have been chosen." ...|$|R
50|$|Music, {{as in all}} Almodóvar’s major films, {{also has}} a {{significant}} role. The bolero, regarded by him as expressive of great emotions, is used at key moments to underpin both the <b>mother’s</b> <b>superior</b> feelings for Yolanda and Yolanda’s feelings for her. They sing along with Lucho Gatica’s bolero: Encadenados (Chained together).|$|R
25|$|The convent {{was marked}} by {{internal}} turmoil during Esther's final term as <b>Mother</b> <b>Superior,</b> {{due to a lack}} of new recruits, British opposition to the convent and an increase in Catholic women converting to Anglicanism to marry. The remaining nuns were increasingly critical of Esther and the state of the school, the Ancien Régime was in its decline, they endured yet another military conflict in The Battle of Quebec and the ensuing siege. In 1772 she became assistant superior, and from 1778 until her death Wheelwright served as an overseer and advisor.|$|E

The <b>Mother</b> <b>Superior</b> of the Domestic Service Daughters recommended Dora, who happened to have some days off at the time.

He later lets Jude into the asylum through the kitchen entrance and she tells him she must speak to Mary Eunice alone in the office.|$|E
25|$|The three Healy sisters {{attended}} {{parochial schools}} in Montreal, Canada, ultimately entering Catholic orders. Martha, the oldest, left her convent {{after several years}} and moved to Boston, where two brothers were. She married an Irish immigrant. Josephine lived with her family in Boston before joining the Religious Hospitallers of Saint Joseph. Eliza joined the Congregation of Notre Dame in Montreal, where she was known as Sister Mary Magdalen.

She has become recognized as the first African American to reach this position.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of Areala {{has its roots}} in the , or the Fraternity of Our Lady, a traditionalist Catholic organization. In 1991, a chapter was established in New York City's East Harlem in order to found a soup kitchen. It was in New York that Sister Marie Chantel who had been a black belt in Judo learned Taekwondo under a Hell's Kitchen martial arts master. Her fellow nuns, including the <b>Mother</b> <b>Superior,</b> also learned self-defense hearing that the neighborhoods were dangerous, though they insist that their martial arts training is mostly for sport and that they have had no problems with the surrounding neighborhoods. Their story was ultimately picked up and reported by The New York Times.|$|E

25|$|Esther's {{background}} facilitated {{contact with}} the British and made the Ursulines seem less threatening. The convent was a popular target of criticism, representing France, Catholicism and women in power, and the Ursulines feared that the British might close the convent. Nevertheless, it had frequent contact with and visits from the community. The <b>Mother</b> <b>Superior's</b> threefold British, French and Indigenous ties made her a strong political symbol, {{and it was in}} English interest to claim her as one of their own.|$|R

25|$|In 1712, the <b>Mother</b> <b>Superior,</b> Le Marie des Anges, {{created a}} {{contract}} for 18-year-old Esther's entry to the convent. Esther then began a three-month postulancy, during which time she abided by the disciplined monastic schedule but did not don the religious habit. Her connections with Father Bigot and the Marquis de Vaudreuil allowed Esther to have an impressive career as an Ursuline nun. Most women of modest backgrounds like Esther who were joining the Ursulines were only permitted to become lay nuns, meaning they were relegated {{to the back of}} the procession and were forbidden to sing in church. Esther, however, was allowed to become a choir nun despite not being able to afford the full dowry.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} 1500 years, Arrakis (now called Rakis) is {{returned}} to a desert by the thriving sandworm cycle.

She engineers the destruction of Rakis by the Honored Matres to free humanity, leaving one remaining worm to start the cycle anew. Taraza is killed; her successor Darwi Odrade takes the worm to Chapterhouse. She submerges it in a spice bath to generate sandtrout, {{with the goal of}} populating Chapterhouse, and later other planets, with new worms and infinite potential for gathering spice.|$|E
25|$|The Jews of Warsaw, who {{prior to}} the war {{numbered}} some half a million people, were forced into the Warsaw Ghetto in 1940. By November 1941, the Nazi governor of the city had decreed {{that the death penalty}} would be applied with utmost severity to those sheltering or aiding Jews in any way. Matylda Getter, <b>mother</b> <b>superior</b> of the Franciscan Sisters of the Family of Mary took the decision to offer shelter to any Jewish children who could escape the Ghetto. Getter's convent was located {{at the entrance to the}} Ghetto. When the Nazis commenced the clearing of the Ghetto in 1941, Getter took in many orphans and dispersed them among Family of Mary homes. As the Nazis began sending orphans to the gas chambers, Getter issued fake baptismal certificates, providing the children with false identities. Living in daily fear of the Germans, the Family of Mary rescued more than 750 Jews.|$|E
