40|$|International audienceAutomatic and <b>manual</b> <b>sampling</b> for {{ochratoxin}} A (OTA) in {{barley grain}} was compared under industrial conditions considering sampling uncertainty {{as well as}} practical and technical aspects. Ten tonnes of barley inoculated with Penicillium verrucosum were incubated until the OTA concentration reached approximately 15 µg/kg and sampled with manual and automatic sampling. A nested experimental design and ANOVA was used to estimate variance components from sampling, sample reduction, sample preparation and analysis. <b>Manual</b> <b>sampling</b> resulted in a high sampling uncertainty and OTA concentrations in aggregate samples ranged from 2 - 80 µg/kg. When aggregate samples were formed by automatic sampling the uncertainty arising from nugget effects and spatial distribution was practically eliminated. Results from this study show that an automatic sampler mounted after a mixer or conveyer can provide representative samples of OTA from a moving stream of barley. Automatic sampling might present a practical and economical alternative to <b>manual</b> <b>sampling</b> for feed mill operators when monitoring low levels of mycotoxins in grain or other commodities. Despite careful precautions, sample preparation and analysis resulted in a relative uncertainty of +/- 40 % (p= 0. 95), which was attributed to the subsampling following the two grinding steps. Size fractionation of the coarsely ground barley showed that 40 % of {{the total amount of}} OTA was present in a small fraction of fine particles with a strong tendency to aggregate or stick to equipment and containers.

In the present study, the Abbott LCx HIV RNA Quantitative assay was evaluated in conjunction with automated HIV- 1 RNA extraction on the MagNA Pure LC instrument and compared to the conventional LCx HIV RNA Quantitative assay, which uses a manual nucleic acid extraction protocol. Accuracy, linearity, and interassay and intra-assay variations were determined. The performance of the assay in a routine clinical laboratory was tested with a total of 105 clinical specimens. When the accuracy of the LCx HIV RNA Quantitative assay with the automated sample preparation protocol was tested, all results were found to be within ± 0. 5 log unit of the expected results. Determination of linearity resulted in a quasilinear curve over 3. 5 log units. For determination of interassay variation, coefficients of variation were found to be between 21 and 66 % for the LCx HIV RNA Quantitative assay with the automated sample preparation protocol and between 10 and 69 % for the LCx HIV RNA Quantitative assay with <b>manual</b> <b>sample</b> preparation.

40|$|Objective To analyze two {{different}} methods for performing three-dimensional power Doppler angiography (3 D-PDA) vascular sampling in solid and cystic-solid adnexal masses. Methods Twenty-one 3 D-PDA volumes from 18 consecutive and unselected solid or cystic-solid adnexal masses (13 malignant and five benign) were analyzed. A single examiner (J. L. A.) acquired all the volumes {{according to a}} predetermined scanning protocol. Two different observers (one inexperienced and the other experienced) calculated 3 D-PDA vascular indices (vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI)) from solid tumor areas. First, <b>manual</b> <b>sampling</b> (Plane A, 15 ◦ rotation-step) was performed, and 1 week later 5 -cm 3 sphere sampling from the most vascularized area was carried out. The observers made a record of any difficulty that they encountered in delineating the solid areas of tumors or in distinguishing true tumor vessels from preexisting vessels, the time spent performing each analysis was recorded and inter- and intraobserver reproducibility was evaluated for each method using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Results In four (19. 0 %) of the 21 volumes sphere sampling could not be performed {{because it was not}} possible to obtain a sphere smaller than 5. 5 cm 3. This happened in cases in which image zooming was used when acquiring the 3 D volume. The inexperienced observer encountered more difficulty, but not significantly more, than the experienced observer when analyzing 3 D-PDA volumes both by <b>manual</b> <b>sampling</b> (29 % vs. 14 % of cases) and 5 -cm 3 sphere sampling (35 % vs. 18 % of cases). The mean time spent by the inexperienced observer was significantly greater (P < 0. 001) than that spent by the experienced observer both for <b>manual</b> <b>sampling</b> (6. 11 min vs. 1. 85 min) and 5 -cm 3 sphere sampling (2. 93 min vs. 2. 15 min). Contrary to the findings for the experienced observer, the inexperienced observer required less time to perform sphere sampling than they did <b>manual</b> <b>sampling.</b> Interobserver agreement was high for both methods: ICC for manual volume, 0. 993; manual VI, 0. 908; manual FI, 0. 913; manual VFI, 0. 914; sphere volume, 0. 949; sphere VI, 0. 954; sphere FI 0. 850; and sphere VFI, 0. 953. Intraobserver reproducibility was also high, with all ICCs above 0. 99. Conclusions Manual and 5 -cm 3 sphere sampling are reproducible methods for 3 D-PDA vascular sampling. Caution is required when image zoom is used at the time of acquiring the volume because this may prevent sphere sampling. Difficulties found in performing both manual and sphere sampling do not seem to significantly affect the reproducibility of Doppler index calculations...|$|E
