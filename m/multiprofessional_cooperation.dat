30|$|According to the European {{guidelines}} for quality assurance {{in breast cancer}} screening and diagnosis [13, 19], a breast unit must have a core team composed of health professionals of various disciplines who have undergone specialist training in breast cancer beyond that given in their general training. This {{emphasizes the importance of}} training in <b>multiprofessional</b> <b>cooperation</b> amongst radiology staff, and the same result was also found in this integrative review [5]. Communication and social skills are also mentioned among the central competences of radiographers in these guidelines [13, 19]. In this integrative review, it was evident that radiographers lacked competence for working in a patient-centred way [25, 36].|$|E
40|$|Objective: There {{is a great}} {{interest}} on both a national and international level in promoting cooperation between different occupational groups within the healthcare professions through interprofessional education (IPE),,. Within this project, a peer teaching course on the puncture of peripheral veins was therefore converted from a course for medical students into an IPE learning unit. Students from different occupational groups were to learn {{within the context of}} this course, according to the definition from the World Health Organisation (WHO), with and from each other. Project description: This course constituted a small group class in the peer teaching format. The didactic principle was {{based on the idea that}} the students were to practice the respective practical skills in pairs and give each other reciprocal feedback. Together with the Department for Health at the Bern University of Applied Sciences (BUAS) and the Bern Center of Higher Education of Nusing (BCHEN), the course, which was conducted by the Institute of Medical Education at the University of Bern (IME), was converted into a voluntary IPE pilot project. Students from all three institutions were represented in terms of participants as well as tutors. Results: The course was evaluated very positively by participants, peer tutors and the participating institutions. By means of an OSCE, it could be proven that the course content had been successfully imparted. On the basis of these results, it was determined that the course should be compulsory in the future for students at all three institutions. Discussion: The evaluation results show the successful conversion of the course into an IPE format within the context of the pilot project. The interactive format of the course created the prerequisite that the students from different professional groups learned with and from each other in actuality, and did not just study the same objectives at the same time as with <b>multiprofessional</b> learning. <b>Cooperation</b> between the three institutions is a cornerstone for the development of a research structure which may examine the effect of IPE in the future...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Aglossia {{is a rare}} {{condition}} {{caused by}} failure of the tongue embryogenesis process (in the fourth to eighth weeks of gestation). The tongue is an organ used in different activities such as sucking, swallowing, chewing, and talking. It is also responsible for shaping palate dental arches (in its absence, they become atrophic). There are few similar cases reported in the literature. Objective To describe a rare case of aglossia and the multidisciplinary professionals working together for 5 years to treat the patient. Resumed Report An 8 -year-old girl with aglossia had an assessment comprising: (1) clinical assessment of the stomatognathic system related to resting posture, tonus, and mobility; (2) orthodontic assessment; (3) surface electromyography of the chewing muscles; (4) swallowing videofluoroscopy. Conclusion The authors confirmed the need of multidisciplinary cooperation to improve the patient's quality of life, because agenesia implicates many activities/functions that depend on the tongue to fully work. <b>Multiprofessional</b> <b>cooperation</b> helps the patient learn compensation mechanisms...|$|E

30|$|Thematic {{analysis}} of the selected study results produced three main challenges of mammography training for radiographers: (1) training needs, (2) radiographer related challenges, and (3) challenges related to the organization of education. Training needs comprised four subthemes, each of them representing a specific area of training needing to be developed in mammography education: (1) <b>multiprofessional</b> <b>cooperation</b> within the diagnostic process of breast cancer (BC) [5]; (1) image quality such as artefact recognition, quality control and dosimetry as well as implementing and maintaining quality control and quality assurance [5, 24, 25, 31, 32]; (3) competences in patient-centred work such as counselling patients in the issues related to mammography or {{taking into account the}} psychosocial needs and comfort of the patient [25], and (4) performance of breast imaging in an optimal way, including breast pathology, and performing basic digital mammography and further examinations, e.g., interventional procedures of the breast tissue and tomosynthesis [31]. Radiographer related challenges mentioned in the selected studies included a lack of commitment and motivation, and the effective delivery of the training, particularly in relation to role extension associated with the amount of time required for radiographers to learn and rehearse the script [33]. Challenges related to the organization of education involved information about the education and giving feedback to those who attend these trainings [33] (Table 3).|$|E
40|$|The aim was {{to study}} some aspects of patients´ well-being, related to nutrition, {{activities}} of daily living and health related quality of life, when undergoing major gastrointestinal cancer surgery. Chart documentations (N= 45) of patients undergoing subtotal pancreatectomy were studied, and showed the patients' well-being to be affected, although {{it was not possible to}} fully evaluate the results of the assessments and the care given. A Subjective Global Assessment of nutritional status (SGA), was therefore modified and translated into Swedish, its validity and reliability were tested, and found to be acceptable. Patients with colorectal cancer (N= 90) were prospectively assessed by the modified SGA, six nutritional criteria, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire-C 30, version 1. 0 (EORTC QLQ-C 30) and the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Staircase preoperatively, and at follow up (median 6. 7 months). During hospital stay the patients’ energy intake were recorded and compared with their estimated basal energy expenditure. The results showed the well-being of the patients to be affected preoperatively by gastrointestinal symptoms, weight loss and fatigue, with 8 % classified as suspected of being malnourished. An association was found between tumour burden, diabetes, treatment factors, and postoperative nutrition-associated complications. The patients were found to be semistarved postoperatively. At follow up evaluations the patients had improved emotionally, had better appetite, and had higher scores on quality of life, compared to preoperatively, although an increase in dependence in {{activities of daily living}} and persistent scores of fatigue were found. In conclusion, well-being of patients undergoing major gastrointestinal cancer surgery is affected, and requires systematic assessment and documentation. Nutritional treatment and care is suggested to be improved by <b>multiprofessional</b> <b>cooperation...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to describe functionality of the psychiatric rehabilitation program from the standpoint of a patient and create a client oriented work strategy. This research examines customer orientation in psychiatric rehabilitation process from the standpoint of patients’ experience. The main questions are how do patients experience customer orientation, how do they define customer orientation in their experiences and expectations and, finally, what kind of role customer orientation plays in practise of professionals. This research analyzes the experiences of nine psychiatric rehabilitation patients. I interviewed four men and five women to ensure wider approach and diversity in the results. This research respects the scientific tradition of a phenomenological-hermeneutics research. Interviews were oriented according to phrasing of a question. Collected materials are analysed using method of content-based analysis. First I dissect client orientation as a principle of service in theory. I bring out some of the changes in conception of humankind, of social welfare and public health care systems as well as new structures of unfortunate life. I also examine client orientation as a foundation of values, the changes of professionalism and customer orientation as an ethical obligation. Then I focus on customer orientation as a theoretical construct in pursuance of illustrating some definitions of customer orientation. After this I process implementation of rehabilitation in the psychiatric institutional care. This section covers the structural change of mental health services and rehabilitation of a patient with mental disturbance in the forum of rehabilitation. As the result of the analysis I created four main categories. Main categories are psychiatric hospital in experience, experiencing participating, subjectivity vs. professionalism and experiencing interaction. The contentual classes of psychiatric rehabilitation are the definitions of customer, the goals of rehabilitation and the methods of the rehabilitation. According to the mental patients client oriented rehabilitation is a process including well-planned methods, individual orientation, co-operation and constant evaluation. Implementation of customer-oriented service is good nursing and a way to reach the goals set in cooperation. Customer orientation demands <b>multiprofessional</b> <b>cooperation</b> and patients who partake in decision-making. The requirements for customer-oriented service are fluent flow of information between professionals and a patient, empowering co-operation, relevant agency and making time for above-mentioned. The guideline for customer-oriented service can be described with words such as explicitness, integrity, trust, individuality, solidarity, affability, supportive, empathy and discretion. The structure of rehabilitation process seemed to be unclear and without any terse structure. For the mean time the proportion of customers influence in rehabilitation plan was fringe. Customers’ role was to be an informant and passive recipient. Target-orientation of rehabilitation was mostly problem-based and strengthens the conception of metal disturbance as a static and chronic phenomenon. Also integration of institutional care and treatment of outpatients appeared to be unclear. But the same token, the patients’ slant on professionalism was pretty ambiguous. On the one hand patients were willing to have an influence in the rehabilitation plan, on the other hand they were willing to bow out of decision-making. Professionalism claimed patients’ attention and justification regardless. The main obstacle for customer orientation, as experienced in the field of mental health care, was the dominating working culture based on the classical idea of professionalism. The obstacles to better customer orientation were related to the implementation of treatments, the attitudes of nurses and patients, setting and reaching the goals, insufficient interaction and some necessities of treatment. It was obvious that rehabilitation and the principles of customer orientation were always in contradiction in a setting where the possibility of coercive measures exists. While defining customer orientation, the rehabilitation patients do not come out with any expectations or suggestions related with the economical or administrative issues of the hospital. Expectations on decision-making in a wider societal context were also marginal. In consequence customer orientation will always be interpreted through the factual interdependence of a patient and the hospital stuff. Endast sammandrag.
