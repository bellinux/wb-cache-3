25|$|Leaves are {{eaten by}} the larva {{of the coastal}} race of the ash pug moth and by larvae of other Lepidoptera, {{including}} brown-tail, dun-bar, emperor moth, <b>mottled</b> <b>umber,</b> and Coleophora elaeagnisella.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{frequently}} occurring pests are the winter moth (Operophtera brumata) and the <b>mottled</b> <b>umber</b> moth (Erannis defoliaria).|$|E
50|$|The <b>mottled</b> <b>umber</b> (Erannis defoliaria) is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae. It is a common species {{throughout}} much of the Palearctic region.|$|E
500|$|Design firm Sarofsky {{once again}} {{worked on the}} film's main-on-end title {{sequence}}, having done the same for Winter Soldier. The sequence used [...] "muted and <b>mottled,</b> burnt <b>umber</b> and steel blue and cold grey" [...] colors, which were stark contrasts to the sequences for Winter Soldier and The First Avenger (the later created by Method Design) which were [...] "a minimalist graphic approach, reducing the key players to silhouettes and paring the palette down to three colors" [...] and [...] "vibrant and iconic propaganda art comes to life, enticing the viewer to join the fray", respectively. Creative director Erin Sarofsky noted {{one of the challenges}} for Civil Wars sequence was [...] "to make it feel like a Captain America title sequence and not an Avengers sequence" [...] given the number of characters in the film.|$|R

50|$|Cotoneaster {{species are}} used as larval food plants by some Lepidoptera species {{including}} grey dagger, <b>mottled</b> <b>umber,</b> short-cloaked moth, winter moth and hawthorn moth. The flowers attract bees and butterflies and the fruits are eaten by birds.|$|E
50|$|Firs {{are used}} as food plants by the {{caterpillars}} of some Lepidoptera species, including Chionodes abella (recorded on white fir), autumnal moth, conifer swift (a pest of balsam fir), the engrailed, grey pug, <b>mottled</b> <b>umber,</b> pine beauty and the tortrix moths Cydia illutana (whose caterpillars are recorded to feed on European silver fir cone scales) and C. duplicana (on European silver fir bark around injuries or canker).|$|E
50|$|Amelanchier {{plants are}} {{preferred}} browse for deer and rabbits, and heavy browsing pressure can suppress natural regeneration. Caterpillars of such Lepidoptera as brimstone moth, brown-tail, grey dagger, <b>mottled</b> <b>umber,</b> rough prominent, the satellite, winter moth, and the red-spotted purple {{and the white}} admiral (both Limenitis arthemis), as well as various other herbivorous insects feed on Amelanchier. Many insects and diseases that attack orchard trees also affect this genus, in particular trunk borers and Gymnosporangium rust. In years when late flowers of Amelanchier overlap those of wild roses and brambles, bees may spread bacterial fireblight.|$|E
30|$|Winter moth (Operophtera brumata) and <b>mottled</b> <b>umber</b> moth (Erannis defoliaria) are forest Lepidoptera species {{characterized}} by periodic high abundance in a 7 – 11 [*]year[*]cycle. During outbreak years they cause severe defoliation in many forest stands in Europe. In {{order to better}} understand the spatio-temporal dynamics and elucidate possible influences of weather, stand and site conditions, a generalized additive mixed model was developed. The investigated data base was derived from glue band catch monitoring stands of both species in Central and North Germany. From the glue bands only female moth individuals are counted and a hazard code is calculated. The model can be employed to predict the exceedance of a warning threshold of this hazard code which indicates a potential severe defoliation of oak stands by winter moth and <b>mottled</b> <b>umber</b> in the coming spring.|$|E
30|$|The {{developed}} {{model can}} be used for short-term predictions of potential defoliation risk in Central and North Germany. These predictions are sensitive to weather conditions and the population dynamics. However, a future extension of the data base comprising further outbreak years would allow for deeper investigation of the temporal and regional patterns of the cyclic dynamics and their causal influences on abundance of winter moth and <b>mottled</b> <b>umber.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{life cycle}} of the {{univoltine}} geometrid species <b>mottled</b> <b>umber</b> (Erannis defoliaria) and winter moth (Operophtera brumata) in Europe is characterized by an overwintering egg-stage close to the buds of the host tree, hatching in spring in synchrony with the host plant’s budburst, a long pupation stage from summer to autumn in the soil and emergence of the adults from the ground in autumn, usually after the first frost nights, with highest activity from evening hours until midnight (Schwenke 1978). In middle Europe, MUWM densities follow periodic peaks approx. Every 7 – 11 [*]years (Myers 1988; Tenow and Nilssen 1990; Delb 2012). In outbreak years, the polyphagous larvae might entirely defoliate broadleaves and conifers, with a preference for oak (Connell and Steyer 2007).|$|E
30|$|In this study, data of <b>mottled</b> <b>umber</b> moth (Erannis defoliaria) {{and winter}} moth (Operophtera brumata) (short MUWM) from North and Central Germany were analysed. These related species usually occur {{together}} (Altenkirch 1981) and periodically defoliate entire oak stands in spring. In this way they weaken their host {{and act as}} a predisposition factor for severe damage, such as oak decline (Manion 2003). Therefore MUWM are both important and frequently monitored herbivorous insects in Germany. As both species have a similar biology their combined population density is estimated using glue band catches. The amount of caught female MUWM serves for the calculation of the hazard code. When these codes exceed the warning threshold of one, a potential severe defoliation of the host tree in the following spring is expected (Altenkirch 1966; Altenkirch 1981). Therefore, the hazard code also provides a warning threshold for the forest owner that pest control might be necessary in the coming spring.|$|E
30|$|The {{influences}} on the MUWM populations are very complex and many aspects like predators or parasitisation were not considered explicitly in the modelling, {{even though they may}} have a strong regulating impact (Dempster 1983; Berryman 1996; Hunter 1998). Some meteorological variables, such as wind speed, sunshine and relative humidity, might give further explanations. Lagged effects of environmental factors could also be analysed more intensely in a subsequent study with the help of lagged nonlinear models (DLNM, Gasparrini 2011). Furthermore, Tenow et al. (2013) describe outbreak waves of winter moths that are travelling Europe, so considering the Europe-wide spatio-temporal dynamics of outbreaks might give valuable explanations of regional outbreak patterns. The model, however, gives first hints about existing influences. Future inventory data, including further population cycles, would improve the model and allow for further investigation of additional covariates and the verification of the identified effects. In this context, time series data, in particular, are of great value for model improvements. With the help of such an extended data base, winter moth and <b>mottled</b> <b>umber</b> should be investigated separately to clarify whether their sensitivity to the discovered parameters are the same.|$|E
40|$|Insects in 9 {{research}} {{areas in}} pedunculate oak and sessile oak forests in Slovenia have been studied. We identified 35 insect species {{as well as}} two genera from 13 families. The defoliation of oak leaves in studied forests was between 10 and 90 %. More than 80 % of the defoliation was caused by <b>mottled</b> <b>umber</b> and winter moth (Erannis defoliaria Cl., Operophthera brumata L.). Leaf-roll moths are an important group of pests of oak leaves and acorns. The most numerous is the green leaf-roll moth, Tortrix viridana L., followed by Archips crataegana Hb., Laspeyresia splendana Hb. and Laspeyresia amplana Hb. The ratio of appearance of oak sawflies (Apethymus abdominalis Lep. and Apethymus braccatus Gmel.) was 9 : 1. During the past 10 years, oak miner (Tischeria complanella Hb.) has attacked young oak trees heavily. Acorn destroyers (Balaninus glandium Mrsh. and Balaninus nucum L.) were important acorn pests. During the gradation of defoliators in the Prekmurje region of Slovenia there was an increased population density of their predators, such asground beetles and burying beetles (Calosoma sycophanta L., Calosoma inquisitor L., Carabus spp., Xylodrepa quadripunctata L. We can confirm that the health of oak forests in Slovenia is better than in Croatia and southeastern Europe...|$|E
