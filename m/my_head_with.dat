500|$|.....as soon as I got out I {{climbed on}} to the railing and threw myself out to the wire-netting, a {{distance}} of between 20 and 30 feet. The idea in my mind was [...] "one big tragedy may save many others". I realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was the iron staircase. When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw myself from the top, as I meant, {{on to the}} iron staircase. If I had been successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, {{as it was a}} clear drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught {{on the edge of the}} netting. I then threw myself forward on <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> all my might.|$|E
500|$|In a {{statement}} to The New York Times on August 21, 2015, Dre again addressed his abusive past, stating, [...] "Twenty-five years ago I {{was a young man}} drinking too much and in over <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> no real structure in my life. However, none of this is an excuse for what I did. I've been married for 19 years and every day I'm working to be a better man for my family, seeking guidance along the way. I'm doing everything I can so I never resemble that man again." [...] He went on to apologize to all the women he abused, saying, [...] "I apologize to the women I've hurt. I deeply regret what I did and know that it has forever impacted all of our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Blow" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Marrs Piliero. The video was released on February 25, 2011. Kesha wanted the video to be [...] "different, a video that was cool and random". The director, Piliero, {{came up with the}} idea for the video's mythological aspect saying, [...] "I had this idea running in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> just the idea of unicorns, If I massacred unicorns, they could bleed rainbows. I'm a fan of violence and I'm always trying to find a way to make it OK." [...] While being interviewed Piliero spoke of the collaboration with Kesha, explaining her point of view on the video, [...] "Before we started filming, we had quite a few talks. She was adamant you can't back away from the crazy; everything about the idea she loved and she enforced the fact that she wanted to embrace every aspect of it and really go for it, On set, she was having fun. She was like, 'I want to lick a unicorn.' It was rad working with her because there definitely wasn't a sense of her feeling awkward about stuff or detached; no ego. It felt like we had worked together before." ...|$|E

2500|$|William A. Donohue of the Catholic League has {{described}} Pullman's trilogy as [...] "atheism for kids". Pullman has said of Donohue's {{call for a}} boycott, [...] "Why don't we trust readers? [...] Oh, it causes me to shake <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> sorrow that such nitwits could be loose in the world".|$|E

[...] (You see she didn't like to confess, even to herself, that she couldn't make it out at all.) [...] "Somehow it seems to fill <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> ideas—only I don't exactly know what they are! However, somebody killed something: that's clear, at any rate." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1986, Black Flag's {{members had}} {{grown tired of}} the {{tensions}} of their relentless touring schedule, infighting, and of living in near-poverty. The band had been together almost a decade, and true commercial success and stability had eluded them. The band's erratic artistic changes were a barrier to their retaining an audience – Ginn was so creatively restless that Black Flag's albums were often very dissimilar. At one point, Rollins apparently said, [...] "Why don't we make a record that was like the last one so people won't always be {{trying to catch up}} with what we're doing?" [...] The next album, In <b>My</b> <b>Head,</b> <b>with</b> its powerful bluesy proto-grunge-metal, did seem to finally be a cohesive follow-up to their previous album Loose Nut, but it would be their last.|$|E

Oh, it causes me to shake <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> sorrow that such nitwits could be loose in the world." [...] In a {{discussion}} with Donohue on CBS's Early Show, Ellen Johnson, president of American Atheists, said that rather than promote atheism, the film would encourage children to question authority, saying {{that would not be}} a bad thing for children to learn. Director Weitz says that he believes His Dark Materials is [...] "not an atheistic work, but a highly spiritual and reverent piece of writing," [...] and Nicole Kidman defended her decision to star in the film, saying that [...] "I wouldn't {{be able to do this}} film if I thought it were at all anti-Catholic." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1886, American Horse {{replaced}} Sitting Bull as the Indian headliner for the 1886-87 seasons. [...] A journalist asked American Horse what {{he thought}} of the East and he replied, ”I see so much that is wonderful and strange that I feel a wish {{to go out in the}} forest and cover <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> a blanket, so that I can see no more and have a chance to think over what I have seen.” On March 31, 1887, Chief American Horse, Chief Blue Horse and Chief Red Shirt and their families boarded the S.S. State of Nebraska in New York City, leading a new journey for the Lakota people when they crossed the sea to England on Buffalo Bill’s first international to perform at the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria and tour through Birmingham, Salford and London over a five–month period. The entourage consisted of 97 Indians, 18 buffaloes, 2 deer, 10 elk, 10 mules, 5 Texas steers, 4 donkeys, and 108 horses.|$|E
2500|$|Medcalf has {{revealed}} to the Walford Gazette how she prepared for the role: [...] "I actually watched the show a bit when Danniella had been on so I had a distinct memory of her to work with. What I basically did was to read a prepared, detailed biography of the character which {{was provided by the}} production office. I did sit down to watch a five-minute clip of Danniella but I quickly realised I didn't want to carry on watching because I was afraid of falling into doing an imitation of her, d'ye know what I mean? I'll tell you something weird-when I first started getting the scripts I used to hear the lines first in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> HER voice saying them! But that changed over time, thank God, as I hopefully made the character my own and I gave her my voice." [...] Medcalf added that contrastingly to Westbrook, who played Sam as a young girl who was overprotected by her brothers and sheltered, she played Sam as a young woman [...] "trying to find her place both in a career and in relationships with the opposite sex." ...|$|E
6000|$|I was unable, as {{the reader}} may easily conceive, {{to join in}} the Justice's jollity. <b>My</b> <b>head</b> swam <b>with</b> the shock I had received. [...] "I never heard," [...] I said, [...] "that Miss Vernon's father was living." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no!--for {{the love}} of Heaven, no!" [...] exclaimed Quentin. [...] "I would rather you swept <b>my</b> <b>head</b> off <b>with</b> your long sword--it would better become my birth, than to die by the hands of such a foul churl." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{director}} reported her following of live viewer commentary during transmission, via {{social networking}} platform Twitter. One viewer was reported as commenting [...] "...

60|$|Keeping {{near the}} wall, I came {{quite close to}} the door to Tars Tarkas' cell, and there I stood with my longsword above <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> grasped <b>with</b> both hands, that I might bring it down in one quick cut upon the skull of the jailer as he emerged.|$|R
