40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{need for}} {{ensuring}} good power quality (PQ) cannot be over-emphasized in {{electrical power system}} operation and management. PQ problem is associated with any electrical distribution and utilization system that experiences any voltage, current or frequency deviation from normal operation. In the current power and energy scenario, voltage-related PQ disturbances like voltage dips are a fact which cannot be eliminated from electrical power systems since electrical faults, and disturbances are stochastic in nature. Voltage dip tends to lead to malfunction or shut down of costly and mandatory equipment and appliances in consumers’ systems causing significant financial losses for domestic, commercial and industrial consumers. It accounts for the disruption of both the performance and operation of sensitive electrical and electronic equipment, which reduces the efficiency and the productivity of power utilities and consumers across the globe. Voltage dips are usually experienced {{as a result of}} short duration reduction in the r. m. s. (r. m. s. - root mean square) value of the declared or nominal voltage at the power frequency and is usually followed by recovery of the voltage dip after few seconds. The IEEE recommended practice for monitoring electric power quality (IEEE Std. 1159 - 2009, revised version of June 2009), provides definitions to label an r. m. s. voltage disturbance based upon its duration and voltage magnitude. These disturbances can be classified into transient events such as voltage dips, swells and spikes. Other long duration r. m. s. voltage variations are <b>mains</b> <b>failures,</b> interruption, harmonic voltage distortion and steady-state overvoltages and undervoltages. This PhD research work deals with voltage dip phenomena only. Initially, the present power network was not designed to accommodate renewable distributed generation (RDG) units. The advent and deployment of RDG over recent years and high penetration of RDG has made the power network more complex and vulnerable to PQ disturbances. It is a well-known fact that the degree of newly introduced RDG has increased rapidly and growing further because of several reasons, which include the need to reduce environmental pollution and global warming caused by emission of carbon particles and greenhouse gases, alleviating transmission congestion and loss reduction. RDG ancillary services support especially voltage and reactive power support in electricity networks are currently being recognized, researched and found to be quite useful in voltage dip mitigation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis and}} operation of a three-phase pulsewidth modulation rectifier system formed by the star-connection of three single-phase boost rectifier modules (-Rectifier) without a mains neutral point connection. The current forming operation of the-Rectifier is analyzed and it is shown that the phase current has the same high quality and low ripple as the Vienna Rectifier. The isolated star point of-Rec-tifier results in a mutual coupling of the individual phase module outputs {{and has to be}} considered for control of the module dc link voltages. An analytical expression for the coupling coefficients of the-Rectifier phase modules is derived. Based on this expres-sion, a control concept with reduced calculation effort is designed and it provides symmetric loading of the phase modules and solves the balancing problem of the dc link voltages. The analysis also provides insight that enables the derivation of a control concept for two phase operation, such {{as in the case of}} a <b>mains</b> phase <b>failure.</b> The theoretical and simulated results are proved by experimental analysis on a fully digitally controlled, 5. 4 -kW prototype.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} pressure transient effects on water pipeline <b>failures.</b> Water distribution <b>mains</b> {{in the world are}} becoming older and hence are experience more frequent failures. Prediction of pipe failures become very important as the failure of large diameter pipes could lead to high consequences of failure (economic as well as social) such as property damage, interruption to traffic and the loss of confidence in the water utility. The most challenging task is to predict such failures which can depend on several factors that are hard to estimate accurately. Among such factors, internal water pressures, pipe corrosion and traffic loads and can be paramount. Most of the failures of large water mains reported in the literature occurred as a result of high internal water pressure acting on corroded sections of the pipes. Hence, evaluation of steady state as well as transient pressures in the water network is particularly important in the process of pipe failure prediction. This paper reviews {{the state of the art}} of pressure transient modelling to determine the <b>failures</b> of water <b>mains.</b> Relevant <b>failure</b> prediction methods have also been identified to predict the failures of corroded as well as non-corroded water pipes associated with high transient events. The use of pressure transient modelling has been elaborated with the aid of a case study to determine the failures of corroded water pipelines...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays power {{inverter}} {{serves as an}} important emergency power supply system in events of <b>mains</b> power supply <b>failure.</b> The AC output voltage of a power electronic inverter is usually non-sinusoidal and hence has a high harmonic content. Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) scheme is normally used to convert the DC power supply into AC power supply by comparing the reference voltage waveform with the triangular waveform known as carrier. SPWM provides a {{way to reduce the}} total harmonic distortion of load current. The objective {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate a SPWM switching by using Altera DE 2 board.

These switching schemes will trigger the gate of the power switch. In this paper, the SPWM switching strategies will be develop using Altera DE 2 (Cyclone II EP 2 C 35 F 672 C 6) with 16 bit serial configuration devices. The switching between reference and carrier waveforms of SPWM is obtained by using Matlab software. Simulation on the design pulses is conducted using Quartus II software tools provided by Altera.

40|$|Water <b>mains</b> <b>failure</b> {{studies have}} focused on failure {{clustering}} analysis which measures the spatial clustering of failures and failure factor analysis which quantifies the impact of various factors on failure occurrences. This study aims to enhance these two analyses by using a spatial analysis approach. The improvements include (1) initial global and multi-scale geographical statistics to measure the failure clustering, (2) refining quantitative relationships between failure factors and failure occurrences and (3) filling the research gap in subtropical regions by a Hong Kong case study. The global and multi-scale failure cluster measures are based on Moran's I and Ripley's K-statistic. Failure factors are analysed using descriptive statistics and regressions. Failures rates per unit pipe length were found highly clustered in space. The scale at which the failures are the most clustered was also identified. The failure factor analysis revealed quantitative relationships that were more detailed than previous studies, or specific for Hong Kong, between failure rate and four factors: pipe diameter, pipe age, material and temperature. The global failure cluster measure verifies the necessity for cluster analysis in identifying areas of high failure risk. The multi-scale measure suggests that it should be effective and economic to monitor areas of high failure risk if the area size is 1 - 1. 5 km in radius. The refined failure factor analysis can enhance the accuracy of failure risk prediction models and results in several failure control recommendations for Hong Kong and other subtropical cities.

40|$|Considerable capital {{investment}} {{has been made}} in civil infrastructure systems across the globe including water <b>mains.</b> Currently, existing <b>failure</b> detection and location methods do not allow for quick reaction to failures. In addition, no unified standards are followed in condition assessment of water mains. Moreover, the decision by which water mains are inspected is currently carried out based on approximation and experience of decision-makers, which might be limited and may lead to overlooking suitable evaluation methods that might save time, effort and cost. This research presents a methodology that contributes to different phases in the asset management of water mains. It enhances current practice in condition assessment of water mains and assists in setting up rehabilitation priorities. The methodology implemented is based on intensive literature review, evaluation of current methods, field investigation and experiments, and interviews with experts. The methodology considered augments two approaches currently used in condition assessment of water mains, which are proactive and reactive methods. The developed methodology calls for designing a new decision support system (DSS) for selection of most suitable non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method(s). It consists of two components: 1) A Database management system (DBMS), and 2) an evaluation and ranking module (ERM). These NDE methods are used for either detecting suspected leaks or measuring pipe wall thickness, the latter is employed to predict remaining service life of pipe being considered. In case of suspected leaks, this study presents a newly designed automated system for detection of water leaks in underground pipelines and identifying their respective locations. The development of this system is based on using Thermography infrared (IR) camera in order to detect thermal contrast at the pavement surface due to water leaks at the most suitable time. The data obtained is analyzed in order to establish the relationship between the detected leakage area and the approximate location of leak. Prototype software developed in Visual C# environment is implemented {{in order to determine the}} location of leaks automatically. Two deterioration models were designed and developed for estimating remaining useful life of water mains, and predicting annual breakage rate of water mains. The development of the two models is based on the analysis of real data collected from 16 municipalities in Canada and the US. The two models were developed considering two approaches, multiple regression analysis and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) based on the most suitable subsets of selected factors. The final model was selected due to its reliability and better performance in comparison to other models. The outputs of the deterioration models developed in this research were used, in addition to other deterioration factors that were not considered in existing models in order to develop a Decision Support System (DSS) for generating condition rating scale of water main being considered, and for prioritizing rehabilitation/ maintenance actions. The system is hierarchal in structure, and the condition-rating index is generated using Multi Attributes Utility Theory (MAUT). System validation was carried out by comparing its outcome with real case studies. A prototype software application of the model presented in this research is implemented as a proof of concept to demonstrate the capabilities and essential features of the developed models...|$|R
40|$|Cast Iron {{water mains}} used in potable water {{transportation}} systems {{are facing a}} rapidly growing rate of failure. The most common failure mode of cast iron water main is circumferential cracking that occurs due to high longitudinal stresses in the pipe wall, when the longitudinal stress exceeds {{the strength of the}} pipe material. However, the circumferential failure mechanism of the pipe is not well understood. Conventional methods of pipe analysis predict higher circumferential stresses, which would cause longitudinal cracking in the pipe. The higher longitudinal stress is attributed to a number of factors such as corrosion pits on pipe wall, lack of bedding support due to erosion of bedding soil, and localized concentrated supports (or forces) due to lumps of soil or rock pieces. The failure mechanisms of buried cast iron water mains subjected to three factors such as non-uniform bedding support, pitting corrosion and localized concentrated supports are investigated in this thesis. A detailed numerical investigation is carried out based on three-dimensional finite element analyses using ANSYS software. The non-uniform bedding is found to create high longitudinal stresses for larger void at the pipe invert. Although pitting corrosion alone results in high circumferential stresses, when it occurs simultaneously with a non-uniform bedding condition, the peak stresses result in the longitudinal direction. Longitudinal stress is generally higher than the circumferential stress for the pipes with higher relative stiffness with respect to soil. The presence of localized supports is found to be a critical factor, which leads the stresses to exceed the strength of the cast iron material. This study contributes {{to the development of a}} better understanding of the mechanism of cast iron water <b>mains</b> <b>failure...</b>|$|E
