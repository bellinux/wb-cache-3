This study was conducted by using a qualitative and quantitative approach. Data were collected through survey questionnaire, case study, documents pertaining the project performance and also by conducting interviews with the relevant project stakeholders. The study found that 77 % of the respondents agreed that EVMP is good method {{to make sure}} the projects can be completed in time, quality and cost allocated if been implemented properly with competence project team members. Positively the case studies revealed that EVMP projects scored the excellent remark for quality of site management, administration, planning, facilities given and also excellent quality of infrastructure works.

With regard to the benefits and advantages ofEVMP method, it is timely and the right move for PWD to make it mandatory in all projects throughout the country in order to enhance the project performance in the future...|$|R
