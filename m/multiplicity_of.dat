5|$|Technetium can {{catalyse}} {{the destruction}} of hydrazine by nitric acid, and this property is due to its <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> valencies.

The problem was exacerbated by the mutually-enhanced solvent extraction of technetium and zirconium at the previous stage, and required a process modification.|$|E

5|$|In {{the reign}} of Akhenaten (c. 1353–1336 BC) in the mid-New Kingdom, a single solar deity, the Aten, became the sole focus of the state religion. Akhenaten ceased to fund the temples of other deities and erased gods' names and images on monuments, {{targeting}} Amun in particular. This new religious system, sometimes called Atenism, differed dramatically from the polytheistic worship of many gods in all other periods. Whereas, in earlier times, newly important gods were integrated into existing religious beliefs, Atenism insisted on a single understanding of the divine that excluded the traditional <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> perspectives. Yet Atenism {{may not have been}} full monotheism, which totally excludes belief in other deities. There is evidence suggesting that the general populace was still allowed to worship other gods in private. The picture is further complicated by Atenism's apparent tolerance for some other deities, like Shu. For these reasons, the Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat suggested that Akhenaten may have been monolatrous, worshipping a single deity while acknowledging the existence of others. In any case, Atenism's aberrant theology did not take root among the Egyptian populace, and Akhenaten's successors returned to traditional beliefs.|$|E

These results can be used to study the mu-invariants of analytic hypersurfaces, the degree of rational varieties obtained by blowing-up projective spaces, and the degree of the Stuckrad-Vogel cycles in intersection theory.

The other coordinate is deduced from the equation of the line. The <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> an intersection point is the <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding root.
