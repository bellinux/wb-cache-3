5|$|The {{judicial}} system in Belarus lacks independence and {{is subject to}} political interference. Corrupt practices such as bribery often took place during tender processes, and whistleblower protection and national ombudsman are lacking in Belarus's anti-corruption system. However, there is a political will to fight against corruption in the government, {{and the government has}} <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>progress</b> in combating corruption, such as minimizing tax regulations in order to improve transparency in the tax office.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} minor exchanges {{of fire and}} some patrol activity, there was a lull in the battle on 14March in the {{northern}} sector. The following day, three Japanese infantry battalions fell on the US positions before dawn. They <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>progress</b> around Cox's Creek, but US forces counterattacked with air support, bazookas and flamethrowers, retaking part of the line. A platoon of M4 Sherman tanks arrived during the afternoon, and at around 3:00pm they attacked the Japanese with supporting artillery fire and regained more of the perimeter. From there, the battle followed a similar pattern, with a lull in the fighting on 16March, followed by a renewed effort by the Japanese the next day, with several US positions being overrun.|$|E
5|$|On 16 October, the JNA {{mounted a}} major attack against Borovo Naselje. It <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>progress,</b> but became {{bogged down in}} the face of {{determined}} Croatian resistance. On 30 October, the JNA launched a fully coordinated assault, spearheaded by paramilitary forces, with infantry and engineering troops systematically forcing their way past the Croatian lines. The JNA's forces, divided into northern and southern operations sectors, attacked several points simultaneously and pushed the Croatians back. The JNA also adopted new tactics, such as firing directly into houses and then driving tanks through them, as well as using tear gas and smoke bombs to drive out those inside. Buildings were also captured with the use of anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns.|$|E

25|$|In high-income countries, {{the highest}} tax-to-GDP ratio is in Denmark at 47% {{and the lowest}} is in Kuwait at 0.8%, {{reflecting}} low taxes from strong oil revenues. Long-term average performance of tax revenue {{as a share of}} GDP in low-income countries has been largely stagnant, although most have shown some improvement in more recent years. On average, resource-rich countries have made the most progress, rising from 10% in the mid-1990s to around 17% in 2008.

In the early 1980s, Aliyev barred the offspring of certain legal personnel from attending the Republic's law school, in a purported effort to curb a self-perpetuating elite based on corruption. In 1977, he visited Iran: Mashhad twice and Kerbala once.|$|E
25|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in South Africa is characterised by both achievements and challenges. After {{the end of}} Apartheid South Africa's newly elected government struggled with the then growing service and backlogs with respect to access to {{water supply and sanitation}} developed. The government thus made a strong commitment to high service standards and to high levels of investment subsidies to achieve those standards. Since then, the country has <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>progress</b> with regard to improving access to water supply: It reached universal access to an improved water source in urban areas, and in rural areas the share of those with access increased from 66% to 79% from 1990 to 2010.|$|E

Eleven days later, Gorytus started the 6/4 favourite for the Waterford Crystal Mile at Goodwood Racecourse, where he was expected to be favoured by the firmer ground. After being restrained by Carson in the early stages he <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>progress</b> early in the straight but quickly weakened and finished fifth of the six runners behind Montekin.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, Polish–Lithuanian {{relations}} worsened as Polish politicians {{found it}} hard to accept Lithuanians demand for a complete independence and their territorial demands, especially on ceding the city of Vilnius, Lithuanian historical capital which had nonetheless a Polish ethnic majority. Thus Lithuanian nationalist leaned more and more towards the Soviet side. Polish negotiators <b>made</b> <b>some</b> more <b>progress</b> in negotiations with Latvian Provisional Government, and in early 1920 Polish and Latvian forces were conducting some joint operations against Soviets.|$|R
25|$|In the {{meantime}} 4th Division also had <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>progress.</b> After {{the capture of}} Grosshau, the division was aided by the armored forces of the CCR. The division now headed for Gey, which was reached on 30 November, but heavily defended. Two days later the Germans mounted a counterattack out from Gey, which caused heavy casualties. The attack was only stopped by intense artillery fire. Since {{the beginning of the}} offensive, 4th Division had already lost about 6,000 men and was now unable to conduct further offensive operations. Subsequently, Collins decided to halt its offensive operations and pulled the division out to replace it with the 83rd Infantry Division on 3 December.|$|E
25|$|Hyakutake's second thrust {{was delayed}} until 12 March. The Japanese {{advanced}} through a deep ravine {{to approach the}} Piva Yoke fighter strip, and succeeded in penetrating the Perimeter at one point. General Beightler responded by sending combined tanks and infantry to drive them back. Also, Japanese artillery that had been bombarding all three American airstrips was silenced by AirSols bombers. This action ended on 13 March. Hyakutake attempted twice more to penetrate the perimeter, on 15 and 17 March, but was driven back both times. The Japanese mounted a final attack {{on the night of}} 23–24 March, which <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>progress</b> but was then thrown back. On 27 March, General Hodge's Americal Division drove the Japanese off of Hill 260, and the battle came to a close.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} life, known as abiogenesis, {{distinct}} from the evolution of life, is another ongoing field of research. Oparin and Haldane postulated that the conditions on the early Earth were conducive {{to the formation of}} organic compounds from inorganic elements and thus to the formation of many of the chemicals common to all forms of life we see today. The study of this process, known as prebiotic chemistry, has <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>progress,</b> but it is still unclear whether or not life could have formed in such a manner on Earth. The alternative hypothesis of panspermia is that the first elements of life may have formed on another planet with even more favorable conditions (or even in interstellar space, asteroids, etc.) and then have been carried over to Earth—the panspermia hypothesis.|$|E

25|$|The {{attack was}} preceded with {{strafing}} by P-40s and Beaufighters, while A-20s bombed to the rear. Some fifty aircraft participated. This {{was followed by}} {{half an hour of}} artillery bombardment. The massed fire failed to suppress the Japanese position and the attack was met with heavy fire. The advance of the I/126th was misdirected, opening a gap in the left flank. The I/126th was recalled to seal the flank. The attack ended without significant gain as Japanese aircraft from Lae strafed the Americans. An attack on 30 November was to coincide with one by Urbana Force. While the I/126th <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>progress</b> along the axis of the new strip, the day again ended without significant progress. Through the course of these events, some small gains had been made by small attacks and infiltration. Nevertheless, MacArthur became increasingly impatient with Harding's efforts and the lack of progress by the 32nd Division.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Germantown on 4 October 1777, Scott's brigade in Stephen's {{division}} accompanied Nathanael Greene's column. Washington {{planned for}} {{this body of}} troops to assault the British right flank while Sullivan and Stirling attacked the enemy left. Sullivan's and Anthony Wayne's divisions attacked first and <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>progress,</b> but Greene's wing was late in arriving. The deployment of Greene's column was confused. The divisions of Greene and Stephen advanced so quickly that Alexander McDougall's Connecticut Brigade lost sight of them. Meanwhile, Stephen accused Scott of separating his brigade from the division. One observer believed that the brigades of Scott and Muhlenberg (in Greene's division) attacked together. Part of Woodford's brigade and its supporting artillery stopped to fire on 100 British troops at the Chew House. As Stephen's division went forward, it encountered some of Wayne's troops in the fog and a friendly fire incident resulted which caused Wayne's men to retreat.|$|E
25|$|On 18 June 1809, Blake made a {{stand in}} the Battle of Belchite. The Spanish army formed on some hills {{in front of the}} town of Belchite. Suchet paid no {{attention}} to Blake's center while sending Musnier to attack the Spanish left and Habert to assault the right. Musnier's troops <b>made</b> <b>some</b> <b>progress,</b> driving back Blake's left wing. Just as Habert struck on the other flank, a lucky hit blew up the Spanish ammunition stores. At this, Blake's men panicked and fled the field. Suchet left Musnier to watch Blake's force and returned to Zaragoza to restore order in Aragon. The Spanish lost 2,000 casualties out of 11,000 infantry and 870 cavalry, plus all nine of their artillery pieces. French losses were only 200 killed and wounded. Musnier {{spent the rest of the}} year pacifying the southern part of Aragon. He scored a few successes but the guerillas learned to avoid major concentrations of French troops.|$|E
