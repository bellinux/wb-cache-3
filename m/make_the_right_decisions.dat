500|$|The idea Gough and Millar came up {{with for}} their show's version of Clark Kent was to strip him down to his [...] "... bare essence ...", {{discovering}} the reasons why Clark became Superman. In Smallville, Clark is fallible, as Gough explains: The thing that we've tried to portray...is that Clark doesn't always <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decisions,</b> and by not making the right decisions, he brings further consequences on himself. Whether it's running away from Jor-El {{at the end of}} season two, or choosing humanity over some sort of Kryptonian mission, those decisions get him in more trouble, and cause more people to suffer, or in Jonathan Kent's case, to die. Welling agreed with Gough's opinion of Clark's fallibility, stating that the mistakes Clark made showed his humanity.|$|E
500|$|Homer is [...] "a (happy) {{slave to}} his various appetites", and would gladly sell his {{soul to the}} devil in {{exchange}} for a single donut. He has an apparently vacuous mind but at times exhibits a surprising depth of knowledge about various subjects, such as the composition of the Supreme Court of the United States, Incan mythology, bankruptcy law, and cell biology. Homer's brief periods of intelligence are overshadowed, however, by much longer and consistent periods of ignorance, forgetfulness, and stupidity. Homer has a low IQ of 55 which has variously been attributed to the hereditary [...] "Simpson Gene" [...] (which eventually causes every male member of the family to become incredibly stupid), his alcohol problem, exposure to radioactive waste, repetitive cranial trauma, and a crayon lodged in the frontal lobe of his brain. In the episode [...] "HOMR" [...] (season 12, 2001) Homer gets surgery to remove the (newly discovered) crayon from his brain, boosting his IQ to 105, but although he bonds very well with Lisa, his newfound capacity for understanding and reason makes him less happy and he gets Moe to reinsert a crayon, causing his intelligence to return to its previous level. Homer often debates with his own mind, which is expressed in voiceover. His brain has a record of giving him dubious advice, sometimes helping him <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decisions,</b> but often failing spectacularly. It has even become completely frustrated and, through sound effects, walked out on him. Homer's conversations with his brain were used several times during the fourth season, but were later phased out after the producers [...] "used every possible permutation". These exchanges were often introduced because they filled time and were easy for the animators to work on.|$|E

The whole project, though, as Thaler and Sunstein acknowledge, raises some pretty awkward questions. If the “nudgee” can’t be depended on to recognize his own best interests, why stop at a nudge?

2500|$|Lexa's {{relationship}} with Clarke {{is presented as}} intense, complex, {{and the one thing}} that manages to soften Lexa's outlook on life. Debnam-Carey said the characters progression from being allies to becoming romantic [...] "stems from a connection that they both share—which is similar experiences and similar positions" [...] in that they are [...] "both very young leaders with great authority, a lot of responsibility. They have to lead a huge amount of people. They have a lot of expectations riding on them." [...] She said the sudden responsibilities they faced, the need to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decisions,</b> and the fact they both grieved over past lovers helped connect them further, and it is a connection they do not have with others. Rothenberg originally stated that while he would not go as far {{to say that it was}} love at first sight for Lexa, [...] "it definitely was a bit of a thunderbolt moment for her when she first saw Clarke." [...] He said Clarke's attraction to Lexa [...] "developed a little bit more slowly, but by the end [...] they were very much intrigued at the possibility of a romantic relationship." [...] He later said [...] "Lexa was definitely smitten—like love at first sight, probably", but maintained it took longer for Clarke to develop romantic feelings for Lexa.|$|E
