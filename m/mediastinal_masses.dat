50|$|The {{most common}} <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> are neurogenic tumors (20% of mediastinal tumors), usually {{found in the}} {{posterior}} mediastinum, followed by thymoma (15-20%) located in the anterior mediastinum.|$|E
50|$|Mediastinal {{shift is}} the {{deviation}} of the mediastinal structures towards {{one side of}} the chest cavity, usually seen on chest radiograph. It may be caused by volume expansion on {{one side of the}} thorax, volume loss {{on one side of the}} thorax, <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> and vertebral or chest wall abnormalities. An emergent condition classically presenting with mediastinal shift is tension pneumothorax.|$|E
50|$|Cough {{may also}} be caused by {{conditions}} affecting the lung tissue such as bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, interstitial lung diseases and sarcoidosis. Coughing can also be triggered by benign or malignant lung tumors or <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses.</b> Through irritation of the nerve, diseases of {{the external auditory canal}} (wax, for example) can also cause cough. Cardiovascular diseases associated with cough are heart failure, pulmonary infarction and aortic aneurysm. Nocturnal cough is associated with heart failure, as the heart does not compensate for the increased volume shift to the pulmonary circulation, in turn causing pulmonary edema and resultant cough. Other causes of nocturnal cough include asthma, post-nasal drip and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Another cause of cough occurring preferentially in supine position is recurrent aspiration.|$|E

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) has been gradually universal application, but its {{value in the}} preoperative staging of lung cancer and <b>mediastinal</b> <b>mass</b> biopsy remains to be explored. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the value of clinical application between mediastinoscopy and EBUS-TBNA, desiring to provide an objective basis for the rational choice applications. Methods Between July 2009 and December 2012, mediastinoscopy patients with 361 cases accepted biopsy, including 199 cases of lung cancer and 162 cases of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>mass</b> of unknown origin, EBUS-TBNA patients with 348 cases accepted biopsy, including 216 cases of lung cancer and 132 cases of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>mass.</b> Comparing the diagnostic results and related indicators of two methods, this article analyzed the clinical value both the preoperative staging of lung cancer and the diagnosis of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>mass.</b> Results Taking pathology diagnosis as the gold standard, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of mediastinoscopy and EBUS-TBNA are 98. 33 %, 98. 17 %, 100 % and 90. 80 %, 90. 00 %, 100 %. Two techniques in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer have not statistically significant (P> 0. 05), but in the diagnosis of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>mass</b> have statistical significance (P< 0. 05). Conclusion Mediastinoscopy and EBUS-TBNA have a similar role in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer; but mediastinoscopy for <b>mediastinal</b> <b>mass</b> is superior to EBUS-TBNA...|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, we {{describe}} the first case of a patient with TAFRO syndrome with a large anterior <b>mediastinal</b> <b>mass.</b> The surgical approach was very beneficial in terms of diagnosis and treatment because it enabled us to confirm the TAFRO syndrome and transiently control disease progression with a resection of the large <b>mediastinal</b> <b>mass.</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the prevalence and CT image characteristics of anterior <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> in a population-based cohort and {{their association with}} {{the demographics of the}} participants. Materials and methods: Chest CT scans of 2571 Framingham Heart Study participants (mean age 58. 9 years, 51 % female) were evaluated by two board-certified radiologists with expertise in thoracic imaging for the presence of anterior <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses,</b> their shape, contour, location, invasion of adjacent structures, fat content, and calcification. For participants with anterior <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses,</b> a previous cardiac CT scan was reviewed for interval size change of the masses, when available. The demographics of the participants were studied for any association with the presence of anterior <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses.</b> Results: Of 2571, 23 participants (0. 9 %, 95 % CI: 0. 6 – 1. 3) had anterior <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> on CT. The most common CT characteristics were oval shape, lobular contour, and midline location, showing soft tissue density (median 32. 1  HU). Fat content was detected in a few cases (9 %, 2 / 23). Six out of eight masses with available prior cardiac CT scans demonstrated an interval growth over a median period of 6. 5 years. No risk factors for anterior <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> were detected among participants’ demographics, including age, sex, BMI, and cigarette smoking. Conclusions: The prevalence of anterior <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> is 0. 9 % in the Framingham Heart Study. Those masses may increase in size when observed over 5 – 7 years. Investigation of clinical significance in incidentally found anterior <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> with a longer period of follow-up would be necessary...|$|E
40|$|Background Multiple {{different}} types of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> may be encountered on imaging techniques in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. The location and composition of these lesions are critical to narrowing the differential diagnosis. Methods Radiological compartmentalisation of the medias-tinum helps in focusing the diagnosis of masses {{on the basis of}} their site. Some diseases, however, do not occur exclu-sively in any specific compartment and can spread from one compartment to another. Results Tissular components of the mass, the degree of vascularisation and the relationships with mediastinal structures assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are a leading edge of the radiological diagnosis. Special applications at MRI have been developed over the recent years in order to identify accurately tissular components of the medi-astinal masses. The likelihood of malignancy of the <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> is influenced by the symptomatology and the age of the patient. This article reviews the most commonly encountered <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> considering clinical history and manifestations, anatomical position and certain details seen on different imaging modalities that allow correct diagnosis in many cases. Conclusion Familiarity with the radiological features of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> facilitates accurate diagnosis, differenti-ation from other mediastinic processes and, thus, optimal patient treatment. Teaching Points • CTand MRI are important for the diagnosis of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses.</b> • The location and tissue characteristics on imaging studies are critical to narrow down the differential diagnosis of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses.</b> • Symptomatology and patient age affect the likelihood of malignancy...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Phaeohyphomycosis is {{a disease}} caused by dematiaceous fungi. Here, the first culture-proven case of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>mass</b> due to Fonsecaea pedrosoi is reported. The patient was a 40 -yr-old male who had {{presented}} with history of dyspnoea and dysphagia. Computed tomography of the chest disclosed a <b>mediastinal</b> <b>mass.</b> Cultures of a specimen from the mediastinum grew Fonsecaea pedrosoi. The patient received amphotericin B and itraconazole and showed a remarkable recovery. Repeat computed tomography revealed {{a reduction in the}} <b>mediastinal</b> <b>mass.</b> The case highlights the need for a high degree of clinical suspicion and appropriate histopathological and mycological examination of clinical specimens...|$|R
40|$|Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} (LCH) {{is a rare}} disorder {{characterized by}} proliferation and accumulation of clonal dendritic cells with varied clinical presentation and an unpredictable course. We report a 5 -month-old infant with LCH who presented with severe respiratory distress, a large <b>mediastinal</b> <b>mass,</b> significant generalized lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Lymphoma, especially T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, can present with superior mediastinal syndrome needing urgent empirical therapy without biopsy. However, lack of response prompted a biopsy which confirmed {{it to be a}} case of LCH and that leads to appropriate therapy and survival. There have been reports of LCH presenting with isolated <b>mediastinal</b> <b>mass</b> or with generalized lymphadenopathy, but the combined presentation of generalized lymphadenopathy with large <b>mediastinal</b> <b>mass,</b> hepatosplenomegaly, and fever in an infant has rarely been reported. Conclusion. LCH should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of an infant presenting with generalized lymphadenopathy, <b>mediastinal</b> <b>mass,</b> hepatosplenomegaly, and fever...|$|R

30|$|<b>Mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> span a wide histopathological and {{radiological}} spectrum. The {{most frequent}} lesions {{encountered in the}} mediastinum are thymoma, neurogenic tumours and benign cysts, altogether representing 60 % of patients with <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> [1]. Neurogenic tumours, germ cell neoplasms and foregut cysts represent 80 % of childhood lesions, whereas primary thymic neoplasms, thyroid masses and lymphomas {{are the most common}} in adults [1].|$|E
40|$|CT is an {{important}} modality for imaging <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses,</b> and certain CT attenuation features (fat, calcium, or water attenuation, contrast enhancement) are well known to suggest specific diagnoses. In a series of 132 consecutive patients with tissue-proven <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses,</b> these specific CT features were present in only 16. We evaluated the ability of CT to differentiate soft tissue <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> based on morphology and distribution of disease. Metastatic disease and lymphoma accounted for 69 % of masses in this series, and CT could not generally differentiate them. However, CT was helpful in differential diagnosis in certain settings. CT demonstration of multiple <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> when conventional radiographs showed a single mass generally excluded diagnoses such as thymoma and teratoma. CT demonstration of a single middle mediastinal mass, frequently missed by conventional radiography, made metastatic disease a much more likely diagnosis than lymphoma. Finally, CT demonstration of certain ancillary findings strongly favored a diagnosis of lymphoma (axillary adenopathy) or metastatic disease (solitary pulmonary mass, focal liver lesions, bone lesions) ...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Video-assisted thoracoscopy {{has been}} {{successfully}} used for several different thoracic procedures in adults. However, its use in children has been limited. The present study evaluated our experience with video-assisted thoracoscopy in the diagnosis of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> in children. Methods: Nine children (age range, 3 to 18 years) with undiagnosed <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> underwent video-assisted thoracoscopy. The operation was performed using general anesthesia, with the patient intubated with a single lumen endotracheal tube. Results: In all cases adequate tissue for diagnosis was obtained. Three patients had tuberculosis, two had Hodgkin's disease, two had granuloma, one had metastatic Wilms 1 tumor, and one had thymic hyperplasia. There were no complications related to the operative procedure. Conclusions: Video-assisted thoracoscopy for the diagnosis of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> in children is a safe procedure. It provides good visualization, access to the mediastinum and adequate tissue for diagnosis. Further, postoperative discomfort is tolerable and cosmetic results are excellent...|$|E

30|$|Plain chest roentgenogram {{shows the}} shadow of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>mass</b> in 70 %, {{presence}} of calcifications is highly suggestive. The sensivity of ultrasound {{in the evaluation of}} PMG is poor. However, in substernal position CT scan and MRI are very effective. Chest CT scan provides information pointing toward the thyroid nature of the <b>mediastinal</b> <b>mass</b> (Senac & Giron 1992). Heterogeneous multicystic appearance, presence of calcifications, intense enhancement following intravenous administration of iodine and the discontinuity between the <b>mediastinal</b> <b>mass</b> and the cervical thyroid gland are characteristic signs of PMG. Findings on MRI are comparable to the CT (Pappalardo et al. 1993). Calcifications are not clearly visible on MRI, but the relations with great vessels and adjacent organs are best assessed.|$|R
40|$|Anterior <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses</b> {{can develop}} {{from a wide}} {{spectrum}} of pathologic conditions, most of which are malignant in nature and require prompt diagnosis for immediate initiation of the appropriate treatment. Clinical pictures can be variable and complicated by associated intrathoracic conditions requiring surgical management such as pleural and pericardial effusions or nodules (complex anterior <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses).</b> We have used a single-trocar video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approach using thoracic epidural or sole local anesthesia in awake patients. Advantages of awake VATS biopsy include avoidance of all potential adverse effects related to the use of general anesthesia, wide visual control of mediastinal sampling, and accurate assessment of the disease extent with the possibility of obtaining multiple biopsy specimens from different sites of the mass and a diagnostic yield of 100 %. This novel and less invasive surgical option might thus be included within the framework of most reliable methods currently available to manage patients with undetermined anterior <b>mediastinal</b> <b>masses...</b>|$|E
