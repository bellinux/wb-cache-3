30|$|In {{the present}} study, various {{reliability}} parameters of a robotic {{system with a}} conveyer unit are evaluated. The system consists of two robots and one <b>conveyor</b> <b>unit</b> between them. This system may be utilized as a conveyor system in industries. There are three joints in each robot.

40|$|Aims: To {{design and}} develop the cassava digging and {{preparing}} unit and the conveying unit for the Cassava Harvester Machine. Study Design: Efficiency data. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Agricultural Engineering, Faculty of Engineering Khon Kaen University, between September 2011 and February 2012. Methodology: The Cassava Digging and Preparing Unit, and the Cassava <b>Conveyor</b> <b>Unit</b> were constructed. The Cassava Digging and Preparing Unit were functional tested on three digging angles of 20, 25 and 30 degrees on the three randomized soil moisture. The Cassava Conveying Unit was functional tested on six scooping speeds of 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5 and 3. 0 m/s. After adapted the two units to the results from above. The field performance test of the prototype machine was evaluated. Results: The Digging and Preparing Unit found {{to be working on}} the angle of 20 degrees. The <b>Conveyor</b> <b>Unit</b> found to be scooping with less than 1. 5 m/s of speed. The field performance test were showed that: filed capacity, field efficiency, and conveying losses were, 0. 05 ha/hr., 59. 10 %, and 3. 23 % respectively without any losses caused by digging and preparing process. Conclusion: From the functional test of Cassava Digging and Preparing <b>Unit</b> and <b>Conveyor</b> <b>Unit</b> that were designed and developed in this research, it has been found {{to have the ability to}} solve the problem in collecting and conveying cassavas from the ground. This data will pave the way for a prototype of Cassava Harvesting Machine to be fabricated...|$|R

The main emphasis of the paper is on <b>mechanical</b> <b>conveyors</b> in which salient aspects of research and technological developments are highlighted. Since the subject of mechanical conveying is indeed quite broad, the paper focuses primarily, by way of example, on belt and screw conveyors and bucket elevators. Of paramount importance to the design and selection process is the characterization of the flow and handling properties of the bulk solid to be conveyed. This aspect of conveyor design forms the main theme of the paper. The paper is illustrated by case study examples...|$|R

2500|$|Death feigning {{behaviour}} can be deliberately {{induced by}} humans, a prominent example being the [...] "hypnosis" [...] of chickens or pigeons.

30|$|A {{thorough}} investigation over {{the notion of}} learner autonomy, Bandura (1989) as cited in Mercer (2011) explains that the capacity to exercise control over oneâs thought processes, motivation, and action is a distinctly human characteristic. In his âsocial cognitiveâ theory, he proposes a triadic model of human behavior: ââ¦persons are neither autonomous agents nor simply <b>mechanical</b> <b>conveyors</b> of animating environmental influences. Rather, they make causal contribution to their own motivation and action within a system of triadic reciprocal causation. In this model of reciprocal causation, action, cognitive, affective, and other personal factors, and environmental events all operate as interacting determinantsâ(428). Students {{should be aware of}} their own agency and must believe that they can exercise that agency in order to manage learning effectively and regulate emotional responses. Effective learners are aware of themselves as active agents capable of exercising agency through various strategies to actively shape their learning experiences as well as their motivational responses (Bown 2009 as cited in Mercer 2011).|$|R

40|$|As {{electricity}} prices continue to rise, the increasing need for energy management requires {{better understanding of}} models for energy-consuming applications, such as conveyor belts. Conveyor belts are used {{in a wide range}} of industries, including power generation, mining and mineral processing. Conveyor technological advances are leading to increasingly long conveyor belts being commissioned. Thus, the energy consumption of each individual belt <b>conveyor</b> <b>unit</b> is becoming increasingly significant. This paper proposes a generic energy model for belt conveyors with long troughed belts. The model has a two-parameter power equation, and it uses a partial differential equation to capture the variable amount of material mass per unit length throughout the belt length. Verification results show that the power consumption calculations of the newly proposed simpler model are consistent with those of a known non-linear model with an error of less than 4 %. The online parameter identification set-up of the model is proposed. Simulations indicate that the parameters can be identified successfully from data with up to 15 % measurement noise. Results show that the proposed model gives better predictions of the power consumed and material delivered by a long conveyor belt than the steady-state models in the current literature.

40|$|An {{advanced}} system using High Efficiency Solidification Technology (HEST) {{was developed}} to treat PWR liquid waste and the first unit is operating in Taiwan (1) and a detailed design is being carried out for the second unit in Japan. The HEST system consists of two subsystems, a super-concentration subsystem and a solidification subsystem. The super-concentration subsystem is able to concentrate the waste solution to a total boron content as high as 130, 000 ppm prior to solidification. The higher boron content will result in greater volume reduction efficiency of solidification. The solidification subsystem consists of an in-drum mixing and a <b>conveyor</b> <b>units.</b> Representative features of this advanced system are as follows. (1) Simple system: The system consists of the super-concentration and cement solidification subsystems; it {{is as simple as}} the conventional cement solidification system. (2) High volume reduction efficiency: The number of solidified waste drums is about 1 / 2. 5 that of bitumen solidification. (3) Stable Package: Essentially no organic material is used, and the final package will be stable under the final disposal conditions. (4) Zero secondary waste: Washing water used in the in-drum mixer is recycled. This paper describes the outline of HEST technology, treatment system and pilot plant tests...|$|R
