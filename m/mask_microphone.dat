25|$|With the U.S. Army's {{approval}} of the Shure T-17 microphone for use during World War II, Shure began producing what would be several specialized microphones for U.S. military use during that war. Shure's adoption of the Military Standard Specification, and product redesigns intended to conserve raw materials essential to the war effort, positioned the company to fulfill the military's needs for specialized microphones. The T-17 Battle Announce Microphone was {{the most widely used}} microphone in the U.S. Army and Air Force during World War II, and featured a plastic case that conserved aluminum and lighter and more reliable {{in a wide range of}} temperatures and climates. A waterproof version was used on nearly all U.S. Navy ships. Shure also designed the T-30 Throat Microphone for flight crews. A cloth strap held the T-30 against the throat, capturing the user's voice box vibrations directly and avoiding the background noise of the airplane. Shure also manufactured specialized headsets and the MC-1 oxygen <b>mask</b> <b>microphone.</b> In yet another example of the widespread use of Shure microphones by the U.S. military, U.S. lookout Private Lockhard used a Shure 700A microphone to announce his sighting of Japanese planes approaching Pearl Harbor on the morning of On December 7, 1941.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, Shure was {{contracted}} by the United States {{armed forces}} to supply microphones during World War II, and by the following year, the T-17B was the microphone most widely used by the U.S. Army and Navy. Shure also manufactured throat, headset, and oxygen <b>mask</b> <b>microphones,</b> and adopted the United States Military Standard for all Shure microphones.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to determine if}} the high accuracy rate of current voice recognitiion systems would be reduced significantly if speakers were required to enter utterances through a mask, as opposed to the boom microphone used with most conventional voice recognition systems. The findings suggest that no significant increase in non-recognitions (e. g., errors where the system rejects the input and says, in effect, (I don't understand you, say it again) is evident while using a mask. Misrecognitions (i. e., errors where the system accepts the input but mistakes it for a different input) do increase significantly under masked conditions. However, the data also indicate that prior experience with speaking into <b>masks</b> or <b>microphones</b> may be a significant moderator of this relationship; subjects that reported having had little or no experience speaking into <b>masks</b> or <b>microphones</b> showed significantly more misrecognition errors than those that reported having some or considerable experience speaking into <b>masks</b> or <b>microphones.</b> Moreover, the data indicate that, when using masks, those subjects that reported having had experience with speaking into <b>masks</b> and <b>microphones</b> (e. g., pilots, communicators) displayed misrecognition error rates still statistically different from but much more comparable to the error rates displayed by subjects under no-mask conditions 9 th Infantry Division Fort Lewis, WA[URL]...|$|R
50|$|Many {{designs of}} aviator's oxygen <b>masks</b> contain a <b>microphone</b> to {{transmit}} speech to other crew members {{and to the}} aircraft's radio. Military aviators' oxygen masks have face pieces that partially cover {{the sides of the}} face and protect the face against flash burns, flying particles, and effects of a high speed air stream hitting the face during emergency evacuation from the aircraft by ejection seat or parachute. They are often part of a pressure suit or intended for use with a flight helmet.|$|R
5000|$|Following the depressurization, {{the pilots}} {{did not receive}} {{supplemental}} oxygen in sufficient time and/or adequate concentration to avoid hypoxia and incapacitation. The wreckage indicated that the oxygen bottle pressure regulator/shutoff valve was open on the accident flight. Further, although one flight crew mask hose connector {{was found in the}} wreckage disconnected from its valve receptacle (the other connector was not recovered), damage to the recovered connector and both receptacles was consistent with both flight crew masks having been connected to the airplane's oxygen supply lines at the time of impact. In addition, both flight crew <b>mask</b> <b>microphones</b> were found plugged into their respective crew microphone jacks. Therefore, assuming the oxygen bottle contained an adequate supply of oxygen, supplemental oxygen should have been available to both pilots' oxygen masks.A possible explanation for the failure of the pilots to receive emergency oxygen is that their ability to think and act decisively was impaired because of hypoxia before they could don their oxygen masks. No definitive evidence exists that indicates {{the rate at which the}} accident flight lost its cabin pressure; therefore, the Safety Board evaluated conditions of both rapid and gradual depressurization.If there had been a breach in the fuselage (even a small one that could not be visually detected by the in-flight observers) or a seal failure, the cabin could have depressurized gradually, rapidly, or even explosively. Research has shown that a period of as little as 8 seconds without supplemental oxygen following rapid depressurization to about [...] may cause a drop in oxygen saturation that can significantly impair cognitive functioning and increase the amount of time required to complete complex tasks.A more gradual decompression could have resulted from other possible causes, such as a smaller leak in the pressure vessel or a closed flow control valve. Safety Board testing determined that a closed flow control valve would cause complete depressurization to the airplane's flight altitude over a period of several minutes. However, without supplemental oxygen, substantial adverse effects on cognitive and motor skills would have been expected soon after the first clear indication of decompression (the cabin altitude warning), when the cabin altitude reached [...] (which could have occurred in about 30 seconds).Investigations of other accidents in which flight crews attempted to diagnose a pressurization problem or initiate emergency pressurization instead of immediately donning oxygen masks following a cabin altitude alert have revealed that, even with a relatively gradual rate of depressurization, pilots have rapidly lost cognitive or motor abilities to effectively troubleshoot the problem or don their masks shortly thereafter. In this accident, the flight crew's failure to obtain supplemental oxygen in time to avoid incapacitation could be explained by a delay in donning oxygen masks; of only a few seconds in the case of an explosive or rapid decompression, or a slightly longer delay in the case of a gradual decompression.In summary, the Safety Board was unable to determine why the flight crew could not, or did not, receive supplemental oxygen in sufficient time and/or adequate concentration to avoid hypoxia and incapacitation.|$|R
50|$|A throat {{microphone}}, also laryngophone, {{is a type}} {{of contact}} microphone that absorbs vibrations directly from the wearer's throat by way of single or dual sensors worn against the neck. The sensors, called transducers, can pick up speech even in extremely noisy or windy environments such as on a motorcycle, or in a nightclub. Other types of microphones do not function well under these conditions because of high levels of background noise. Advanced laryngophones are able to pick up whispers, and therefore perform well in environments where communicating with others at a distance in silence is required, such as during covert military operations. Throat microphones are also very useful when helmets or respiratory protection is required. Many full-face SCBA, CABA, SAR respirator, PAPR or re-breather masks do not have a provision for a <b>microphone</b> inside the <b>mask.</b> The throat <b>microphone</b> can be used safely, as it is positioned outside the mask's face seal and as such does not compromise the respiratory protection provided by the mask, nor does it violate mask approvals and certification.|$|R
