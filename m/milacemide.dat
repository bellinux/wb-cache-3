50|$|<b>Milacemide</b> (INN) is an MAO-B {{inhibitor}} and glycine prodrug. It {{has been}} studied for its effects on human memory and as a potential treatment for the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Early clinical trials did not show positive results however, and the drug is now abandoned.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the therapeutic effects of <b>milacemide</b> in seven patients with myoclonus and three {{patients with the}} stiff-person syndrome in an open-label trial. <b>Milacemide</b> was initiated at 800 mg/day and was gradually increased to a maximum dosage of 2, 400 mg/day. No significant improvement occurred in the 10 patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of 13 C and 15 N-labeled <b>milacemide,</b> 2 -(pentylamino) -acetamide, {{has been}} studied in rat liver and brain slices using solid-state NMR. This analysis Is fast and efficient {{and can be used}} to monftor both major and minor metabolic pathways In mammalian tissu culture. The NMR work reported herein involves both conven-tionalcross-polarlzation magic-angle spinning 13 and 15 NMR spec-tra and rotational-echo double resonance experiments. The lattr masure quantitatively the breaking of isotopically labeled carbon-nitrogen chemical bonds. Our results, which are consistent with suggestions from previous metabolic studies, show that {{the first step in the}} breakdown of <b>milacemide</b> is the breaking of the pentyl-amine nitrogen bond to yield pentanoic acid and glycinamide. Total Incorporation of 154 label from the resulting glycinamide fragment Is comparable in rat liver and brain. In both tissues, considerably more of the 15 N label from glycinamide is incorporated than the corre...|$|E
40|$|Rats {{were trained}} to {{alternate}} responses on a discrete trial working memory task on a T-maze. In Experiment 1, the rats were then matched for choice accuracy and allocated to three treatment groups. These were: implantation of osmotic minipumps for intraventricular infusion of either (a) 15 mM D- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonopentanoic acid (AP 5) or (b) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (VEH); and an unoperated control group (UNOP). In Phase 1 we assessed alternation performance with a minimal delay between responses: the UNOP and VEH rats continued to choose accurately; the AP 5 rats showed an impairment of choice accuracy, but recovered over days. In Phase 2 a 20 -s delay between responses was enforced, and choice accuracy was assessed following injections either of saline or of <b>Milacemide</b> HCl (10 mg/kg). There was now a severe and enduring impairment of choice accuracy in the AP 5 group, but <b>Milacemide</b> injections did not affect performance {{in any of the}} treatment groups. In Experiment 2 rats were trained in a similar way, and then given intraperitoneal injections of MK 801 or of physiological saline in a within-subjects design and tested for T-maze performance with a minimal or a 20 -s delay between responses. In the first Phase, MK 801 was given 10 -min before behavioural testing commenced; in the second Phase, it was given 28 - 40 min before behavioural testing commenced. The outcome depended critically on the time between drug injection and testing. There was a significant drug-induced impairment of choice accuracy in both Phases; but in Phase 1 there was no impairment in testing with a minimal retention interval and an impairment with a 20 -s retention both retention intervals. We conclude that AP 5, but not MK 801, interferes with temporary memory storage in a delay-dependent manner...|$|E
40|$|Although glycine {{does not}} cross easily the blood-brain barrier, it {{exhibits}} {{at very high}} doses (10 - 40 mmol kg- 1) a modest anticonvulsant activity. In this study, carbamate derivatives [...] N-benzyloxycarbonylglycine (Z-glycine) and N,tert-butoxycarbonylglycine (Boc-glycine) [...] have been compared with glycine. Z-glycine (1 mmol kg- 1), but not Boc-glycine, reduces the number of tonic convulsions in the 3 -mercaptopropionic and in the bicuculline tests, increases the latency of seizures in the strychnine test and is as active 3 h after administration as sodium valproate 30 min after administration in the maximal electroshock seizure test. Overall, <b>milacemide,</b> a precursor of glycine, and Z-glycine have rather similar anticonvulsant profiles in mice. The lack of Z-glycine affinity for the strychnine sensitive glycine receptor and the strychnine insensitive glycine receptor associated with the NMDA receptor may indicate that Z-glycine acts either via a prodrug mechanism or per se via an alternative mechanism...|$|E
