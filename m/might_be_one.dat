25|$|Firstly, educated Indonesians {{who were}} {{sympathetic}} to the ideology of nationalism {{were involved in the}} revolution. Most of them received tertiary education and have adopted Western values and practices in their daily life. The connections with the traditional aristocratic families did not manage to stop these people from having strong beliefs in nationalism. Ultimately, they recognized that the presence of kerajaan <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the hindrances for East Sumatran society to achieve full liberalization. Members of this particular group were local governors and regional deputy governors such as Teuku Muhammad Hasan and Mohammad Amir.|$|E
25|$|The {{lighthouse}} was automated in 1989, and {{the island}} has since been uninhabited. The lighthouse is the tallest lighthouse in New Zealand, {{and one of its}} oldest. Due to its black and white stripes, it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of New Zealand's most distinctive lighthouses. There are only two other lighthouses in New Zealand of similar appearance; Cape Campbell Lighthouse also has black and white stripes, whilst Cape Palliser Lighthouse has red and white stripes. The lens from 1925 is on display at the Museum of Wellington City & Sea on Jervois Quay in Wellington, on loan from Maritime New Zealand. The 1865 rotating mechanism can be seen at the Bluff Maritime Museum.|$|E
25|$|For nearly {{eighteen}} aeons , all {{history has}} {{been the result of}} the struggle between two basic elements, split apart by a divine power from the very beginning: a flexible life-process on the one side, and a formless, undeveloped stasis on the other. The symbol of the former is eternal Rome, with the entire Occident lying behind her; the symbol of the latter is Constantinople, with the ossified Orient.... That the Slavs <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the two world-factors, or if one prefers, the shadow of the shining image of European humanity, and therefore that the constitution of the earth might not admit philosophical reconstruction without their assent, is the great scholarly heresy of our time.|$|E

25|$|Both {{the harmful}} effects of {{radiation}} upon biological systems (induction of cancer and acute radiation injuries) and the useful effects of radiotherapy involve the radiation chemistry of water. The vast majority of biological molecules are present in an aqueous medium; when water is exposed to radiation, the water absorbs energy, and as a result forms chemically reactive species that can interact with dissolved substances (solutes). Water is ionized to form a solvated electron and H2O+, the H2O+ cation can react with water to form a hydrated proton (H3O+) and a hydroxyl radical (HO.). Furthermore, the solvated electron can recombine with the H2O+ cation to form an excited state of the water, this excited state then decomposes to species such as hydroxyl radicals (HO.), hydrogen atoms (H.) and oxygen atoms (O.). Finally, the solvated electron can react with solutes such as solvated protons or oxygen molecules to form respectively hydrogen atoms and dioxygen radical anions. The fact that oxygen changes the radiation chemistry <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> reason why oxygenated tissues are more sensitive to irradiation than the deoxygenated tissue at the centre of a tumor. The free radicals, such as the hydroxyl radical, chemically modify biomolecules such as DNA, leading to damage such as breaks in the DNA strands. Some substances can protect against radiation-induced damage by reacting with the reactive species generated by the irradiation of the water.|$|E
25|$|Some {{art historians}} once {{identified}} {{the child as}} a young Cosimo I de' Medici, but it is now generally accepted to be Giulia. The child in the portrait {{appears to be a}} little girl, rather than a boy, and her expression is anxious. Maria Salviati, who is dressed soberly as befitted a widow, is seen sheltering the vulnerable child against her side. Art historian Gabrielle Langdon argues that the girl's demeanor in the portrait is different than would have been expected for the child Cosimo, whose family anticipated his role as a strong leader from his earliest days. It would have been to Cosimo I's advantage to commission a portrait depicting his mother as an exemplary widow, affectionately bringing up the orphaned daughter of Cosimo I's predecessor. The child's full lips, round nose, and curly reddish hair also bear little resemblance to known portraits of Cosimo as a child, though they do to portraits of the young Alessandro. Other girls of about the right age who were at court during this period also do not resemble the child in the portrait. The portrait <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the first in Renaissance-era Europe of a girl of presumed African and European ancestry. This painting is in the permanent collection of The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
500|$|The United States media, while {{generally}} reporting negatively on Scientology {{in domestic}} news, {{has taken an}} at least partially supportive stance towards Scientology in relation to Germany. Richard Cohen for example, writing in the Washington Post, said in 1996: [...] "Scientology <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> weird religion, but the German reaction to it is weirder still– not to mention disturbing." [...] Alan Cowell, writing in the New York Times, wrote in 1997 that the German response to Scientology– motivated by officials' fear that Scientology [...] "was a totalitarian movement growing, like the Nazi party, from inconsequential beginnings"– was itself redolent of [...] "the Nazi era's authoritarianism".|$|E

500|$|Temples were {{sometimes}} referred to in hieroglyphic texts as k'uh nah, meaning [...] "god's house". Temples were raised on platforms, most often upon a pyramid. The earliest temples were probably thatched huts built upon low platforms. By the Late Preclassic period, their walls were of stone, {{and the development of}} the corbel arch allowed stone roofs to replace thatch. By the Classic period, temple roofs were being topped with roof combs that extended the height of the temple and served as a foundation for monumental art. The temple shrines contained between one and three rooms, and were dedicated to important deities. Such a deity <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the patron gods of the city, or a deified ancestor. In general, freestanding pyramids were shrines honouring powerful ancestors.|$|E
500|$|The size of Eta Carinae A is {{not even}} well defined.

At optical depth 0.67 the radius would be , indicating an extended optically thick stellar wind. At the peak of the Great Eruption the radius, so far as such a thing is meaningful during such a violent expulsion of material, would have been around , comparable to the largest-known stars.|$|E

500|$|During spring {{training}} in 2001, incumbent first baseman Mark McGwire said to Cardinals manager Tony La Russa {{that if he}} did not promote Pujols to the major league roster, [...] "it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the worst moves you make in your career." [...] La Russa later recounted the [...] "myth" [...] that Pujols only made the Opening Day roster in 2001 because Bobby Bonilla was injured. [...] According to La Russa, he and the rest of Cardinals management were impressed enough by Pujols that they decided to promote him to the big league club even before Bonilla's injury. [...] Although the team did not require Pujols to fill any particular position, the Cardinals activated him to the Opening Day roster, and he started all season at either third base, right field, left field, or first base.|$|E
500|$|After British naval expeditions in 1818 and 1827–28 had probed {{north of}} Spitsbergen {{and found no}} sign of the {{supposed}} polar sea, the quest was in abeyance for 25 years. In the 1850s, the search for the lost Franklin expedition generated a rash of incursions into the Canadian Arctic. From these forays, particularly that of Edward Inglefield in 1852, [...] emerged the theory that Smith Sound, a northerly channel between Greenland and Ellesmere Island, [...] <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the fabled gateways to the [...] polar sea. This brought a succession of expeditions to this area: Elisha Kent Kane in 1853–55, [...] Isaac Israel Hayes in 1860–61, Charles Francis Hall in 1872–74, and George Nares in 1875–76. No gateway was found, although both Kane and Hayes claimed, mistakenly, to have seen the Open Polar Sea from a distance.|$|E

The bills of fare for dinners for 6 persons thus represent the simplest menus in the book. All the dinners are divided into a first and a second [...] "Course", but each course was divided in turn into three or four servings, in most cases with a choice of two or more dishes.

500|$|Several {{publications}} {{praised the}} album's concept, and for being more humorous than the band's preceding albums. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said: [...] "In {{an era when}} heavy rockers {{have no idea what}} happened in the '80s, much less the '30s, it's hard not to warm to this, even if his music isn't your own personal bag." [...] Barry McCallum of Independent Online called the album [...] "reckless and uninhibited—but it's not all that hard to imagine Manson letting go; he's had fun here." [...] Chronicles of Chaos also praised its concept, and {{went on to say that}} it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the best albums in the band's discography, Alternative Press and Q each complimented the album's production, while Billboard highlighted the album's lyrical content and Manson's [...] "diatribes on religion, sex and prejudice."

That alone was worth the price of admission." ...|$|E
500|$|Eight {{months after}} No Line on the Horizons release, Bono {{said he was}} {{disappointed}} with the album's sales. Regarding the lack of commercial appeal, Bono said, [...] "We weren't really in that mindset. We felt that the 'album' is almost an extinct species, and we [...] create a mood and feeling, and a beginning, middle and an end. And I suppose we've made a work that is a bit challenging {{for people who have}} grown up on a diet of pop stars." [...] Clayton agreed that the album's commercial reception must be [...] "challenged" [...] but said, [...] "the more interesting challenge is, 'What is rock 'n' roll in this changing world?' Because, to some extent, the concept of the music fan—the concept of the person who buys music and listens to music for the pleasure of music itself—is an outdated idea." [...] The Edge predicted that, despite its lack of a big hit, No Line on the Horizon would grow on listeners over time. He noted that the reaction to the songs in the live setting made U2 believe that the material was connecting with the fans, adding, [...] "There's a lot of records that make great first impressions. There <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> song that gets to be big on the radio, but they're not albums that people... play a lot. This is one that I gather from talking to people.... Four months later, they're saying, 'I'm really getting into the album now.
