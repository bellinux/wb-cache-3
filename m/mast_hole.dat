50|$|French scholar Emile de St. Denis {{suggested}} the corvus featured a 36-foot bridge with the <b>mast</b> <b>hole</b> set 12 {{feet from the}} near end. The design suggested by de St. Denis, however, did not include an oblong hole and forced the bridge to travel {{up and down the}} mast completely perpendicular to the deck at all times.|$|E
50|$|Harvey {{had been}} picked up three days earlier in the dinghy along with Renee's dead body. He told United States Coast Guard {{investigators}} that a squall had brought down the Bluebelles <b>masts,</b> <b>holing</b> the ship's hull, rupturing the auxiliary gas tank, and starting a fire. He claimed he had found Renee floating {{in the water and}} tried unsuccessfully to revive her. (An autopsy showed that she had died of drowning.) However, after Harvey was informed of Terry Jo's rescue, he checked into a motel under an assumed name and committed suicide with a razor blade.|$|R
50|$|A {{truck is}} a {{nautical}} {{term for a}} wooden ball, disk, or bun-shaped cap {{at the top of}} a <b>mast,</b> with <b>holes</b> in it through which flag halyards are passed. Trucks are also used on wooden flagpoles, to prevent them from splitting.|$|R
50|$|This year on 6 August 2014 {{the crew}} of Stena Paris entered into the news by saving an elderly Swedish couple from their {{dismasted}} yacht near the Cook Islands. The Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand (RCCNZ) detected a beacon alert from the yacht Blue Horizon. The couple, a 69-year-old woman and 70-old-man, feared the broken <b>mast</b> would <b>hole</b> the hull. The chemical tanker {{was close to the}} accident and saved the two seafarers.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the summer}} 2011-2012 shutdown, the {{approaches}} to Britomart were rebuilt {{to allow for}} electrification, <b>masts</b> installed and <b>holes</b> bored, and wiring completed in some areas. During the 2013-2014 shut-down, the complex job of wiring Quay Park Junction, The Strand stabling facility and Britomart was completed.By January 2014 wires had been installed: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{boat had}} a T-shaped keel, {{probably}} seven frames and six strakes joined with wooden pegs. This and the {{positioning of the}} <b>mast</b> in a <b>hole</b> {{in one of the}} frames, suggests influences from Slavic boatbuilding techniques. It is built in the tradition going back to the Hjortspring boat (400-300 BC) and is compared to the boats from Danzig-Ohra 2, Skuldelev 6 and Valsg√§rde 2.|$|R
50|$|Edwin Fox was {{overtaken}} {{by the age}} of steam, and in the 1880s she was refitted as a floating freezer hulk for the booming sheep industry in New Zealand. She was towed to Picton in the South Island on 12 January 1897 where she initially continued as a freezer ship, before being further dismembered in 1905 when converted into a coal store hulk. By this time she had long since lost her rigging and <b>masts,</b> and suffered <b>holes</b> cut in her sides and the removal of most fittings. The ship was in use until 1950, then abandoned to rot at her moorings.|$|R
50|$|At 11pm on 13 May 1866, the Auckland Islands were sighted dead ahead. With {{only light}} winds the crew {{were unable to}} change course, and she {{collided}} against the cliffs and drifted into a large cave on Auckland Island's western shore. The rising tide and increasing swell caused the main mast to hit the cave roof repeatedly until the <b>mast</b> forced a <b>hole</b> through the hull; the ship sank on 14 May 1866. Although the weather remained calm, the boats were not launched immediately on the ship entering the cave as it was very dark, there was no obvious landing place, and pieces of spars and rock were falling down continually.|$|R
60|$|But the French captain {{knew his}} business, and putting his helm over again, ran off the wind, {{so that the}} two vessels were now on the same tack, with the Agile on her opponent's quarter. Several of the French guns were now brought to bear, but their {{discharge}} was too hurried, and owing to the brigantine lying so much lower in the water, the shot flew between her <b>masts</b> or made <b>holes</b> in her mainsail. In a moment she was round again, and crossed her opponent's stern {{at a distance of}} some thirty yards, the word being passed along that the gunners were to aim at the rudder-post and to double-shot the guns. A loud cheer rose as two of the shots struck the mark. The Frenchman replied with a volley of musketry from the marines gathered on her poop. Three of the sailors fell, and several others were hit.|$|R
60|$|The rain got lighter {{suddenly}} {{and a cold}} draught touched her forehead. She saw Thirlwell glance astern, {{although he did not}} miss a stroke. His soaked hat drooped about his head and his thin overalls were dripping; she thought he saw she was looking at him, but he did not speak. Then the haze that had shut them in rolled back and a dark line advanced across the lake. It had a white edge and there was a curious humming, rippling noise that got louder. Thirlwell signed to one of the Metis, who stepped a <b>mast</b> in the <b>hole</b> through a beam and loosed a small sail. The sail blew out like a flag, snapping violently, and the man struggled hard to push up the pole that extended its peak. Then he hauled the sheet, and the canoe swayed down until her curving gunwale was in the water. The half-breed moved to the other side and Thirlwell beckoned Agatha.|$|R
