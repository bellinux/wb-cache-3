40|$|International audienceMost of the {{thermodynamic}} models {{available in}} the literature describing the speciation of the calcite surface do not predict a significant concentration of sorbed Ca(II), whereas previous electrokinetics studies clearly show that Ca 2 + is the <b>main</b> <b>cation</b> determining {{the potential of the}} calcite surface. This study proposes a new thermodynamic model based on ion-exchange theory that is able to describe the reversible sorption of Ca 2 + on calcite. To constrain the model, concentrations of Ca(II) sorbed reversibly on the mineral surface were obtained as a function of pH. Such experimental data were obtained using solutions in equilibrium with both calcite and fixed pCO 2 (g) values (from 10 − 5 to 10 − 2 atm). The concentration of (de) sorbed Ca(II) is almost constant in the [7 − 9. 5] pH range, having a value of approximately 1. 2 × 10 − 6 ± 0. 4 × 10 − 7 eq*g− 1. Such a value agrees with total sorption site densities that were previously calculated by crystallography and is used to obtain a selectivity coefficient between H+ and Ca 2 + species by fitting the experimental data. Then, selectivity coefficients between H+ and different metallic cations (Zn 2 +, Cd 2 +, Pb 2 +) that are able to accurately describe previously published data are proposed. Finally, the model is used to predict the contribution of calcite in the overall sorption of Cd(II) on a natural and complex solid (calcareous aquifer sand) ...|$|E

However examples will also be drawn from the organic and biological fields to illustrate specific aspects of the development of the technique, with further reference to solution studies. Calcium is an important element in many natural materials as well as those being developed synthetically. It is the fifth most abundant element in the earth’s crust at 3. 5 % [1] and is found in many minerals, with the three most common being CaCO 3 (calcium carbonate, which is present in limestone and marble in the form of different polymorphs), CaSO 4 · 2 H 2 O (gypsum) and CaF 2 (fluorite). Calcium carbonate also features in other very important natural biomaterials such as shells and human gallstones.

Basiphilous mesotrophic communities with many rare plant species grow in one site on Terschelling and two sites on Schiermonnikoog. Samples were taken in the period mid May 1992 - mid May 1993. Bulk atmospheric nitrogen deposition measured in an open collector was between 15 - 20 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for the eight sites. On Terschelling, the deposition was slightly higher than on Schiermonnikoog. Ammonium was a third of the total amount of nitrogen deposited on Terschelling and half the amount of nitrogen deposited on Schiermonnikoog. The deposition of potential acid varied from 490 to 810 mol ha(- 1) yr(- 1). On Terschelling, the amount of potential acid was highest and around 800 mol ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for both sites.

The present study demonstrates that the addition of 50 nmol/l Ag+ to the mucosal medium during oxytocin treatment caused an additional large increase of the La 3 +-sensitive Isc component. The power density spectrum of the fluctuation in current contained a Lorentzian component which was enhanced by oxytocin treatment. The Lorentzian component disappeared {{as a consequence of}} the administration of mucosal Ag+. In experiments with Ca 2 +, Ba 2 + or Mg 2 + as principal mucosal cation, the La 3 +-sensitive Isc component was negligible under control conditions and during oxytocin treatment.

Methods: Leaching columns were established using residue sand.

Results: Much of the Na+, K+, Cl− and SO⁴₂- was lost during the first four leachings. Additions of phosphogypsum to both surface and subsurface layers resulted in partial neutralization of soluble alkalinity. Mean pH of leachates ranged from 8. 0 to 8. 4, the major cation leached was Na+ and the major balancing anion was SO⁴₂-.

Na+-K+ pump current (Ip) was absent in cells dialysed with Na+-free pipette solutions and was almost voltage independent at 50 mM Na+pip (potential range: − 100 to + 40 mV). By contrast, the activation of Ip by 0. 5 – 5 mM Na+pip was clearly voltage sensitive and increased with depolarization, independently of the main intracellular cation species. The apparent affinity of the Na+-K+ pump for cytoplasmic Na+ increased monotonically with depolarization. The [Na+]pip required for half-maximal Ip activation (K 0. 5 value) amounted to 5. 6 mM at − 100 mV and to 2. 2 mM at + 40 mV. The results suggest that cytoplasmic Na+ binding and/or a subsequent partial reaction in the pump cycle prior to Na+ release is voltage dependent. From the voltage dependence of the K 0. 5 values the dielectric coefficient for intracellular Na+ binding/translocation was calculated to be ≈ 0. 08.

The kinetics {{of growth}} of porous anodic alumina films and of the pore wall oxide dissolution during anodisation was studied. Based on the derived kinetic parameters, suitable physicochemical processes in the barrier layer I electrolyte interface controlling the anion incorporation in the barrier laver were suggested and relevant models were formulated. According to these processes Al 3 + and H+ ions are rejected from the pore base surface in the attached double layer, where Al 3 + ions are solvated, and are transferred to the pore filling solution. The strongly different mobilities of Al 3 + and H+ and the necessary space negative charge density distribution in the double layer result in similar concentration distributions of Al 3 + and anions inside it, which differ strongly from that of H+.

In this paper, a hydrogeochemical study is presented for the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer in Tazerbo Wellfield, SE Libya, based on chemical analyses and physical parameters for 108 wells. Samples were collected from 108 borewells of the Nubian Aquifer (Akakus Formation) from depth range between 280 m in the north and 500 m in the south. This study is the first hydrochemical investigation in Tazerbo and also in the whole Sahara, which introduces the importance of considering the end members and the synsedimentary influence for the interpretation of the groundwater hydrochemistry. The results of the analyses indicate soft to moderately hard, lowly mineralized, slightly alkaline groundwater, with Mg 2 + as the <b>main</b> <b>cation</b> and HCO 3 - as the main anion. The major hydrogeochemical processes that affect the quality of water in sediments of the Nubian system at Tazerbo have been identified; the water type is mostly fresh MgHCO 3, while NaHCO 3 and KHCO 3 are also found for some wells. These water types indicate that groundwater chemistry is changed by cation exchange reactions during flushing of the aquifer by freshwater from the south...|$|E
40|$|Sixty {{water samples}} (35 {{groundwater}} samples, 22 surface water samples and three hot-spring water samples) were collected at 36 points from villages and towns in Lhasa city, Nagchu (Nagqu) prefecture, Ali (Ngari) prefecture and Shigatse (Xigaze) prefecture (Tibet) in 2013 {{to study the}} hydrochemical characteristics and element contents of natural waters. The concentrations of elements were determined in the water samples and compared with the concentrations in water samples from other regions, such as southeast Qinghai, south Xinjiang, east Sichuan and west Tibet. The hydrochemical species in different areas were also studied. Water {{in most parts of}} Tibet reaches the requirements of the Chinese national standard and the World Health Organization international standard. The pH values of the water samples ranged from 6. 75 to 8. 21 and the value for the mean total dissolved solids was 225. 54 mg/L. The concentration of arsenic in water from Ali prefecture exceeded the limit of both the Chinese national standard and the international standard and the concentration of fluoride in water from Shuanghu exceeded the limit of both the Chinese national standard and the international standard. The main hydrochemical species in water of Tibet is Ca (HCO 3) (2). From south to north, the <b>main</b> <b>cation</b> in water changes from Ca 2 + to Na+, whereas the main anions in water change from HCO 3 (-) to Cl- and SO 4 (2 -). The chemistry of river water and melt water from ice and snow is dominated by the rocks present at their source, whereas the chemistry of groundwater is affected by many factors. Tectonic divisions determine the concentrations of the main elements in water and also affect the hydrochemical species present...|$|E
40|$|Crystals of a silico-ferrite {{of calcium}} and {{aluminium}} (SFCA) and an Al-free SFC were prepared from the melt by slow cooling of synthetically prepared mixtures and examined by single-crystal diffraction methods. Both crystals {{belong to the}} space group P- 1. SFC has lattice parameters a = 9. 1255 (3) Å, b = 10. 1189 (3) Å, c = 10. 6183 (2) Å, α = 63. 9554 (9) °, β = 84. 4964 (11) °, γ = 65. 6706 (9) ° with a final R(|F|) = 0. 024. SFCA has a cell with a = 9. 0738 (9) Å, b = 10. 0474 (10) Å, c = 10. 5611 (10) Å, α = 64. 061 (3) °, β = 84. 356 (3) °, γ = 65. 722 (3) ° with a final R(|F|) = 0. 030. The SFC structure was transformed to the cell used by Hamilton et al. (1989) and refined to an R(|F|) = 0. 024. All the atomic positions are equivalent to those reported by Hamilton et al. (1989) {{with the exception of}} one (Ca,Fe) position and two oxygen positions that are displaced from the published positions by 0. 5 y (Ca,Fe 1), 0. 5 z (O 4), or 0. 5 x (O 12). This is ascribed to transcription errors in the published crystal structure data. The calculated powder pattern of SFCA (this study) was compared with the experimental data and it shows that the low angle peak intensities agree significantly better than those calculated from the published atomic positions. Additional electron density is located in proximity to the octahedral and tetrahedral cation sites of the main structure. These positions, coupled with the partially occupied cation sites of the main structure, suggest a minor sharing of cations between the <b>main</b> <b>cation</b> sites and the additional sites.

40|$|Abstract. A marine psychrotolerant {{bacterium}} {{from the}} Antarctic Ocean showing high chitinolytic activity on chitin agar at 5 °C was isolated. The sequencing of the 16 S rRNA indicates taxonomic affiliation of the isolate Fi: 7 to the genus Vibrio. By chitinase activity screening of a genomic DNA library of Vibrio sp. strain Fi: 7 in Escherichia coli, three chitinolytic clones could be isolated. Sequencing revealed, {{for two of}} these clones, the same open reading frame of 2, 189 nt corresponding to a protein of 79. 4 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame showed homology of 82 % to the chitinase ChiA from Vibrio harveyi. The chitinase of isolate Fi: 7 contains a signal peptide of 26 amino acids. Sequence alignment with known chitinases showed that the enzyme has a chitin-binding domain and a catalytic domain typical of other bacterial chitinases. The chitinase ChiA of isolate Fi: 7 was overexpressed in E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) and purified by anion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Maximal enzymatic activity was observed at a temperature of 35 °C and pH 8. Activity of the chitinase at 5 °C was 40 % of that observed at 35 °C. Among the <b>main</b> <b>cations</b> contained in seawater, i. e., Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, and Mg 2 +, the enzymatic activity of ChiA could be enhanced twofold {{by the addition of}} Ca 2 +...|$|R
40|$|For {{technological}} and nutritional reasons, the dairy industry manufactures different formulations with special mineral compositions {{adapted to the}} needs of the consumer. The formulation consists to mix different chemical constituents such as proteins, lipids, sugars, vitamins and minerals. In these types of formulae, it is necessary to control the addition of minerals because they interact between themselves and also with the protein fraction with possible changes in their physico-chemistry and stability. Recent advances in the understanding of the mineral fraction make possible theoretical calculations of the mineral distribution between aqueous and protein phases in different physico-chemical conditions. These calculations, performed by a specific software named MilkSALTS (Mekmene et al. 2009 and 2010), take into account the : - total concentrations of <b>main</b> <b>cations</b> (calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium) and anions (citrate, chloride, inorganic phosphate, organic phosphate, carboxylic groups); - pH value; - ionic strength; - association constants between cations and anions; - chemical nature (especially Ca/P molar ratio) of the calcium phosphate salts; - solubility of calcium phosphate in the aqueous phase considered as supersaturated. With this model, it is possible to calculate the minerals distribution in normal milk and modified milks. The modifications are additions of different supplementary minerals (CaCl 2, NaCl, phosphate and citrate), different pH values (from 6. 7 to 3. 5) and different casein concentrations. This model constitutes an interesting tool to simulate salt equilibria in various formulations containing different concentrations of minerals and caseins...|$|R
40|$|Soybeans (Glycine max L. Merr., cv Kingsoy) {{were grown}} on media {{containing}} NO 3 − or urea. The enrichments of shoots in K+, NO 3 −, and total reduced N (Nr), relative {{to that in}} Ca 2 +, were compared to the ratios K+/Ca 2 +,NO 3 −/Ca 2 +, and Nr/Ca 2 + in the xylem saps, to estimate the cycling of K+, and Nr. The net production of carboxylates (R−) was estimated from {{the difference between the}} sums of the <b>main</b> <b>cations</b> and inorganic anions. The estimate for shoots was compared to the theoretical production of R− associated with NO 3 − assimilation in these organs, and the difference was attributed to export of R− to roots. The net exchange rates of H+ and OH− between the medium and roots were monitored. The shoots were the site of more than 90 % of total NO 3 − reduction, and Nr was cycling through the plants at a high rate. Alkalinization of the medium by NO 3 −-fed plants was interrupted by stem girdling, and not restored by glucose addition to the medium. It was concluded {{that the majority of the}} base excreted in NO 3 − medium originated from R− produced in the shoots, and transported to the roots together with K+. As expected, cycling of K+ and reduced N was favoured by NO 3 − nutrition as compared to urea nutrition...|$|R
