60|$|In the {{following}} essays, then, the myths and customs of various peoples will be compared, even when these peoples talk languages of alien families, {{and have never}} (as far as history shows us) been in actual contact. Our method throughout will be to place the usage, or myth, which is unintelligible when found among a civilised race, beside the similar myth which is intelligible enough when it is found among savages. A <b>mean</b> <b>term</b> will {{be found in the}} folklore preserved by the non-progressive classes in a progressive people. This folklore represents, {{in the midst of a}} civilised race, the savage ideas out of which civilisation has been evolved. The conclusion will usually be that the fact which puzzles us by its presence in civilisation is a relic surviving from the time when the ancestors of a civilised race were in the state of savagery. By this method it is not necessary that 'some sort of genealogy should be established' between the Australian and the Greek narrators of a similar myth, nor between the Greek and Australian possessors of a similar usage. The hypothesis will be that the myth, or usage, is common to both races, not because of original community of stock, not because of contact and borrowing, but because the ancestors of the Greeks passed through the savage intellectual condition in which we find the Australians.|$|E

40|$|A sensing {{policy for}} the restless multi-armed bandit problem with {{stationary}} but unknown reward distributions is proposed. The work {{is presented in the}} context of cognitive radios in which the bandit problem arises when deciding which parts of the spectrum to sense and exploit. It is shown that the proposed policy attains asymptotically logarithmic weak regret rate when the rewards are bounded independent and identically distributed or finite state Markovian. Simulation results verifying uniformly logarithmic weak regret are also presented. The proposed policy is a centrally coordinated index policy, in which the index of a frequency band is comprised of a sample <b>mean</b> <b>term</b> and a confidence term. The sample <b>mean</b> <b>term</b> promotes spectrum exploitation whereas the confidence term encourages exploration. The confidence term is designed such that the time interval between consecutive sensing instances of any suboptimal band grows exponentially. This exponential growth between suboptimal sensing time instances leads to logarithmically growing weak regret. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed policy performs better than other similar methods in the literature. Comment: In proceedings of the 46 th Asilomar conference 201...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{economically}} motivated two-factor term structure model that generalizes existing stochastic <b>mean</b> <b>term</b> structure models. By allowing a certain parameter to acquire dynamical behavior we extend the two-factor model {{to obtain a}} nonlinear three-factor model that is shown, in a deterministic version, to be equivalent to the Lorenz system of differential equations. With reasonable parameter values the model exhibits chaotic behavior. It successfully emulates certain properties of interest rates including cyclical behavior on a business cycle time scale. Estimation and pricing issues are discussed. Standard PCA techniques used to estimate HJM type models are observed to be equivalent to dimensional estimates commonly applied to 'spatial data' in nonlinear systems analysis.

40|$|This is {{the peer}} {{reviewed}} {{version of the}} following article: Sterk, A. E., Stephenson, D. B., Holland, M. P. and Mylne, K. R. (2015), On the predictability of extremes: Does the butterfly effect ever decrease?. Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, which has been published in final form at [URL] This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-Archiving: [URL] study investigates whether or not predictability always decreases for more extreme events. Predictability is measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE), estimated here from the difference of pairs of ensemble forecasts, conditioned on one of the forecast variables (the 'pseudo-observation') exceeding a threshold. Using an exchangeable linear regression model for pairs of forecast variables, we show that the MSE can be decomposed into the sum of three terms: a threshold-independent constant, a <b>mean</b> <b>term</b> that always increases with threshold, and a variance term that can either increase, decrease, or stay constant with threshold. Using the generalised Pareto distribution to model wind speed excesses over a threshold, we show that MSE always increases with threshold at sufficiently high threshold. However, MSE can be a decreasing function of threshold at lower thresholds but only if the forecasts have finite upper bounds. The methods are illustrated by application to daily wind speed forecasts for London made using the 24 member Met Office Global and Regional Ensemble Prediction System from 1 January 2009 to 31 May 2011. For this example, the <b>mean</b> <b>term</b> increases faster than the variance term decreases with increasing threshold, and so predictability decreases for more extreme events.
