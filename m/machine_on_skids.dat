40|$|The use of skidders {{equipped}} with rubber tires {{is a well}} accepted practice for the extraction of timber from the forest, but the application also causes considerable environmental problems. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effects of different slope gradient, number of <b>machine</b> passes <b>on</b> <b>skid</b> trails and soil depth on soil compaction. The study was designed as an experiment with the factors including slope gradient, soil moisture, and soil depth <b>on</b> various <b>skid</b> trails and with different number of machine passes. The effects of four slope classes (flat, 10 %, - 10 % and - 20 %), three soil depth classes (5, 15 and 25 cm), and different compaction levels based on various number of machine passes (0, 1, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30) were evaluated. A Timberjack cable skidder was used and the study location was in the Kheyrud Educational and Research Forest located in the Hyrcanian forest in northern Iran. The increased number of machine passes increased soil bulk density, but the highest rate of compaction occurred after the initial few passes. Uphill skidding increases soil compaction more than downhill skidding. The increases in bulk density were still significant at the maximum sampling depth of 20 – 30 cm. Soil bulk densities at 5, 15 and 25 cm depth averaged 35, 22 and 17 % higher than densities of undisturbed soil...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores how Canadian artist Fred Herzog’s (b. 1930) empathetic {{photographs}} of unattached, white, working-class men living <b>on</b> Vancouver’s <b>Skid</b> Road in the 1950 s and 1960 s contest dominant newspaper representations. Herzog’s art practice is framed as a sociologically-oriented form of flânerie yielding original, nuanced, and critical images that transcend the stereotypes of the drunk, the criminal, the old-age pensioner, {{and the sexual}} deviant <b>on</b> <b>Skid</b> Road. I apply Critical Discourse Analysis to newspaper articles published in the Vancouver Sun and the Province between 1950 and 1970 to uncover how newspaper discourse produced and reproduced the socioeconomic marginalization of men <b>on</b> <b>Skid</b> Road. Through a comparative analysis, this thesis shows how Herzog’s photographs challenge dominant newspaper discourse in the following ways: by expanding the Skid Road discourse to allow the possibility of positive subject-positions; by demonstrating a dialectical rather than causal relationship between masculinity and space; and by exposing {{the ways in which}} the supposedly deviant sexual practices of men <b>on</b> <b>Skid</b> Road in fact stemmed from the hegemonic capitalist and patriarchal structures of Western society. Drawing on feminist, social, and Neo-Marxian class theories, this study not only deconstructs dominant perspectives but also gives visibility to alternative ones, thereby underscoring working-class subjectivities and uncovering the ways in which working-class masculinity <b>on</b> <b>Skid</b> Road both defied and conformed to hegemonic masculinity in the postwar period...|$|R

40|$|In {{the ground}} based logging {{operation}} construction of skid trails are need to transport logs from felling areas to road side landings. In this research plant species recovery rate and natural tree regeneration <b>on</b> the <b>skid</b> trails with different time of construction (1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010) were investigated in the Hyrcanian forests of Iran. Plant recovery rate including coverage, height, diversity and species importance value were measured and noted <b>on</b> each <b>skid</b> trail by systematic sample plots and {{were analyzed by}} ANOVA and Duncan test. Results showed plant coverage, number of species and plant height <b>on</b> the <b>skid</b> trails were increased by increasing of skid trails construction ages. After 10 years from logging operation only 2 species of tree regeneration (Alnus subcordata and Acer velutinum) were established <b>on</b> the <b>skid</b> trails. Also, after 30 years from skid trail construction and logging operation only 7 species of tree regeneration were established <b>on</b> the <b>skid</b> trails that were seedling and small sapling stages. Sambacus ebulus had the most species importance value <b>on</b> the <b>skid</b> trails with 1 and 10 years old, whereas, <b>on</b> the <b>skid</b> trails with 20 and 30 years old Rubus caesus had the most species importance value.
