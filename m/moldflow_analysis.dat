40|$|The {{demands of}} micro {{injection}} molding parts has been increase tremendously that promote {{the potential of}} its huge markets in this new millennium. The complexity of producing micro injection molding parts is much higher compare to typical injection molding process. Normally, micro injection molding parts was produce by using specially built micro injection molding machine or modified conventional injection molding machine that suit the process of producing micro parts. However, micro injection molding parts can also be ejected in conventional injection molding process. The problem {{is the amount of}} plastic material wasted from the feed system design is always more than 90 %. This is due because the size of conventional injection molding process biggest than micro injection molding process. But nowadays, that problem can be predicted earlier by using <b>Moldflow</b> simulation software <b>analysis.</b> <b>Moldflow</b> simulation software can be used to determine the best feed system design, predict possible molding defects and suggest optimum injection molding parameters.

40|$|Tetra Pak {{has used}} {{numerical}} simulation tools for plastic injection molding (<b>Moldflow)</b> and structural <b>analysis</b> (Abaqus/Implicit and Abaqus/Explicit) for many years. Today these two simulation tools are used independently {{of each other}} without any coupling. How these two disciplines can be combined to better predict the mechanical response of a polymer component is presented in this work. The manufacturing process, in this case injection molding, creates the mechanical properties of the produced polymer part. Process settings, material selection and molding tool geometry affect the polymer flow, material orientation and rate of crystallinity. A method to build a layered finite element model in Abaqus using results from Moldflow simulations regarding crystallinity growth and molecular orientation is proposed. Relatively simple material models were utilized and assigned for each individual material layer through the thickness in the polymer part. These constitutive models were derived phenomenologically from experimental test results and could adequately capture both the microscopic and the macroscopic behavior in a more realistic way. The numerical results showed a good agreement with the experimental results, both regarding visual appearance and force/displacement response. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Warpage {{deflection}} {{is one of}} {{the common}} pitfalls in plastic injection moulding which is always affected the quality and accuracy of the plastic products. It occurs due to the influences of mould temperature during injection moulding process and it is related to the number of cooling system existed in the mould. Therefore, this paper studies the effect of cooling channels on warpage of dumbbell plastic part having different number of cooling channel using <b>Moldflow</b> software. Warpage <b>analysis</b> was run using four and eight cooling channels. Parameters involved in this study are injection time, packing time, melt temperature and mould temperature. The result of warpage from simulation analysis was projected on the graphic having different colour which is presented the actual value of warpage. It is found from warpage simulation result that the maximum warpage for four cooling channels is 1. 283 mm and the maximum warpage for eight cooling channels is 1. 280 mm. It shows that the increasing of the number of cooling channel from four to eight channels in the injection mould reduces the warpage deflection about 0. 2 %. Thus, the result shows that the number of cooling system in the mould plays an important role on the quality of plastic part during injection moulding process...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{durability}} assessment for design {{and analysis of}} two plate mold insert for dog bone specimen using selected sample. The objective of this thesis is to design two plate mold insert and analyze the material flow of the selected product. The thesis describes the material flow analysis to analyzed the material flow in the part and identify the best gate locations of the components. Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) materials were studied in this thesis as sample of material and {{it is commonly used}} in industry and lab. The structural three-dimensional solid modelling of two plate mold was developed using the computer-aided drawing software. The strategy of analysis model was developed. The material flow and gate location analysis was then performed using Moldflow Plastic Insight software. The analysis model of the components was analyzed using the two cavities with cold runner design. Finally, the orientation skin for 21 number of different gate location is analyzed. From the results, it is observed that the <b>analysis</b> using <b>Moldflow</b> material flow <b>analysis</b> show the different orientation skin for different gate locations. The gate locations is constrain at the middle of the part where the area that would be test for the specimen. The orientation skin at the both sides of the part is same but only change the length of runner. The increase of length of runner will increase the projected area, the clamping force, filling time and the material waste. So that, the best locations of gate is at the nearest or as short as it can for runner length to be design. But, the first priority is the orientation skin for the material flow. The orientation skin should be same at the middle of part which is parallel to the strength that would be applied on testing. The final design was done in solid modelling and details drawing using SolidWorks software. The results can also significantly reduce the cost and time to fabricate the insert. That is also can be a reference for the future works of fabrications...|$|R
40|$|Powder {{injection}} moulding (PIM) is a versatile technology {{capable of producing}} complex and near net shape parts. Significant help in optimisation of the PIM process {{can be obtained from}} the numerical simulation. To obtain realistic numerical results it is necessary to fulfil certain conditions. The material properties should be correctly determined in the conditions close to those during the real powder {{injection moulding}}. The process must be described with the appropriate mathematical model. Also proper initial and boundary conditions must be chosen. In this study a standard feedstock of stainless steel 316 L produced by BASF AG has been characterised for determining the input parameters for the numerical simulation. Viscosity of the feedstock was measured in the wide range of shear rates at four temperatures using the capillary rheometer. Specific heat of the studied feedstock was measured with an advanced DSC apparatus at different cooling rates. The obtained data were found suitable to serve as the input parameters for the simulation of the powder injection moulding process. Simulation of the PIM process using a material model for a Generalised Newtonian Fluid has been performed with three best known commercial packages, C-Mold, Moldflow and ProCAST. The obtained simulation results have been compared {{with each other and with}} the experimentally determined ones (melt front advancement, weld line locations, in-cavity temperatures and pressures). It has been proven that the PIM process can be successfully simulated with C-Mold, <b>Moldflow</b> and ProCAST <b>analysis</b> packages. The flow pattern predicted by C-Mold appeared to be less accurate than that predicted by ProCAST and Moldflow. The predictions of the locations of weld lines made by all three analysis packages were in good agreement with the experimental observations, but ProCAST yields the best results. The temperatures of the feedstock predicted in the simulations were in good agreement with the experimentally measured ones. The best predictions of pressure were made by C-Mold. The predicted by C-Mold in-cavity pressure value matched well the experimentally observed one. ProCAST underestimated the in-cavity pressure by 20 - 30 %. The Moldflow pressure results were found to be 3 - 4 times lower than the experimentally observed ones. Despite minor drawbacks, ProCAST was found to be the best analysis package for the numerical simulation of the PIM process. Applied Science...|$|R
