5|$|That {{same day}} five {{soldiers}} were killed in nearby Habbaniyah when their M113 armored personnel carrier {{was hit by a}} mine. According to General Conway, it was the largest <b>mine</b> <b>that</b> had been used in Anbar to date; only a tailgate and a boot were recovered.|$|E
5|$|When workers leave a {{pressurized}} caisson or a <b>mine</b> <b>that</b> {{has been}} pressurized to keep water out, they will experience {{a significant reduction}} in ambient pressure. A similar pressure reduction occurs when astronauts exit a space vehicle to perform a space-walk or extra-vehicular activity, where the pressure in their spacesuit is lower than the pressure in the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|As Aldenham {{was making}} a turn at a {{position}} north of the islet of Škrda, to sail between islands of Planik and Olib, she hit a <b>mine</b> <b>that</b> exploded under her engine room. The ship broke in two and her bow sank quickly, followed by her stern a little later, at 15:29. Cold weather hampered rescue efforts by Atherton and accompanying motor launches ML 238 and HDML 1162, and only 58 seamen and five officers, including Farrant, were {{pulled out of the}} sea. 126 crewmen died, as well as a wounded Yugoslav Partisan transported from Pag for medical treatment and Yugoslav Partisan liaison officer, Colonel Ivan Preradović. Aldenham was the last Royal Navy destroyer lost in World War II.|$|E

5|$|Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen had {{continued}} their journey to Norway while Scharnhorst was immobilized. At 14:45, the ships {{were attacked by}} five Whirlwind fighter-bombers—German fighters beat them back. Several more air attacks followed {{over the next two}} hours, though without success for the British. At 16:17, five British destroyers attempted to torpedo the German ships, but heavy fire from Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen mauled one and forced the others to turn away. Near Terschelling, Gneisenau struck a <b>mine</b> <b>that</b> did minor damage to the hull, though the explosive shock damaged one of her three turbines. Her captain ordered the ship to stop while temporary repairs were conducted, which lasted for about 30minutes. By 03:50 on 13February, the ship had reached Helgoland.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarine}} sank {{only one}} ship, a Greek cargo ship in May 1915, {{but she had}} earlier captured six Montenegrin sailing vessels as prizes in March. U-12 also damaged, but did not sink, the French battleship Jean Bart in December 1914. While searching for targets {{in the vicinity of}} Venice in August 1915, U-12 struck a <b>mine</b> <b>that</b> blew her stern off, and sank with all hands, becoming the first Austro-Hungarian submarine sunk in the war. Her wreck was salvaged the next year by the Italians, who interred U-12s crewmen in a Venetian cemetery.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} al-Birwa's {{inhabitants}} {{participated in the}} 1936–1939 Arab revolt against British rule and mass Jewish immigration in Palestine. A commander of the revolt for the Nazareth-Tiberias region, Sheikh Yihya Hawash, was from al-Birwa. He was arrested by the British and sentenced to life imprisonment. The British also executed eight residents of al-Birwa {{who had participated in}} the revolt. Other rebel commanders and participants in the revolt from al-Birwa included Asad Atallah, Mahmoud al-Joudi, Saleh Mahmoud Me'ari-Abu Sa'ud, Abd al-Hamid Daher Me'ari, Muhammad al-Hajj Ali, Yusef Taha, Fadil Eid, Yousif Mai and Abbas al-Shattawi. A number of women from al-Birwa participated in the revolt by transporting arms, water and food to rebels positioned among the hills in the vicinity. Elderly refugees from al-Birwa interviewed in 2003–2004 recalled that during the revolt, local rebels set off a <b>mine</b> <b>that</b> hit a British military jeep on a road adjacent to al-Birwa in August 1937, prompting the British to launch punitive measures against the village. In particular, the British authorities gathered men from al-Birwa and forced them to cut cactus plants near Acre and then placed the men on top of the cactuses.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota {{returned}} to active service after the United States {{declared war on}} Germany on 6 April 1917, entering World War I. She was assigned to Division 4 of the Battleship Force, based at Tangier Sound in Chesapeake Bay. She spent the war as a training ship for gunners and engine room personnel. During this time, Vice Admiral Albert W. Grant, the commander of Battleship Force 1, instituted a program to reinforce the bulkheads of the ships under his command. This improved their ability to absorb underwater damage and remain afloat. On 29 September 1918, while cruising off Fenwick Island with the destroyer , she struck a naval <b>mine</b> <b>that</b> had been laid by the U-boat U-117, which inflicted serious damage but caused no casualties. The explosion tore a gaping hole in the hull from frame 5 to frame 16, and from the keel to the bottom edge of the armor belt. The bow flooded, but the repaired bulkheads prevented the flooding from spreading. Reduced to a speed of , Minnesota {{made it back to}} the Philadelphia Navy Yard where repairs were effected. The work lasted for five months, by which time Germany had signed the Armistice that ended the war.|$|E
5|$|Pelorus {{was named}} after Pelorus Jack, a Risso's dolphin that often escorted ships through French Pass in New Zealand. The ship was ordered on 1 January 1942 from Lobnitz of Renfrew, Scotland and laid down on 8 October. She was {{launched}} on 18 June 1943 and completed two months later on 7 October. The ship {{was assigned to the}} newly formed 7th Minesweeping Flotilla upon completion and served as the flotilla leader. The flotilla was tasked with clearing mines off the east coast of England until June 1944 when they were assigned to sweep the minefields protecting Juno Beach during the Normandy landings. Pelorus led the flotilla on 6 June and was thus the leading ship of the entire invasion fleet. While sweeping the approaches to Cherbourg, she struck a <b>mine</b> <b>that</b> damaged the port engine and propeller. The ship was under repair for three months and was transferred to the 6th Minesweeping Flotilla at Plymouth when they were completed.|$|E
5|$|Rescued crewmen {{believed}} that they had hit a <b>mine</b> <b>that</b> detonated one of the ship's magazines. Vice Admiral Jorge Dodsworth Martins—Brazil's chief of naval intelligence—thought that Bahia could have been mined or torpedoed by , which surrendered under strange circumstances in Mar del Plata, Argentina, on 10 July (some two months after Germany's surrender), but the Argentine Naval Ministry stated {{that it would have}} been impossible for the submarine to travel from the site of the sinking to Mar del Plata in six days (4–10 July). The U-977, which crew was also heading to Argentina seeking for asylum, was also accused of sinking Bahia. However, military investigations carried out by both US and Brazilian Navies, concluded that the cruiser had been indeed sunk due to the above described gunnery accident.|$|E
