50|$|The {{current in}} the I-phase (stage 1) should be chosen {{depending}} on {{the capacity of the}} battery. In practice, it depends on the capability of the charger. The battery capacity C is expressed in Ah units, typically the C20 value based on a 20-hour discharge time. The charging current (in A units) can be written as C/t where t is a time. For example, for a battery with C = 40 Ah, a current C/(10 h) (usually written as C/10, omitting the 'hours' as time unit) is equal to 4 A. The charging current is a compromise between charging time (favoring high currents), the prevention of damage due to overheating or gassing (favoring low currents), and cost of the charger (favoring low currents). Recommendations for the <b>maximum</b> <b>charging</b> <b>current</b> vary between C/10 and C/2. At high charging currents, active cooling measures may be necessary to prevent overheating.|$|E

30|$|The result {{experiments}} reported above {{demonstrate that}} the low-temperature charge-discharge performance of the battery pack heated in low temperature is improved significantly, and can be draw by the above experiments on the low-temperature heating. The full energy storage capacity can be achieved. However, the maximum charge-discharge power of the heated battery pack heated at − 40  °C cannot be achieved because the heated battery pack is always charged or discharged at 1 C constant current. Poor voltage performance evident in Figs.  6 and 8 prevents the use higher constant currents. Therefore, some experiments were performed using pulse charge-discharge of the heated battery pack at low temperature. Firstly, the battery pack was charged at 1 C/ 3 at room temperature. Secondly, the battery pack was placed at − 40  °C for eight hours to reach thermal equilibrium. Thirdly, the battery pack was heated for 15 min with 90 W power, and finally the battery pack was subjected to charge and discharge pulse currents. The pulses had the minimum discharge current of 17.5 A and maximum discharge current of 280 A and minimum <b>charge</b> <b>current</b> of 17.5 A and <b>maximum</b> <b>charge</b> <b>current</b> of 210 A.

40|$|The pulse-based {{charging}} {{method for}} battery cells {{has been recognized}} as a fast and efficient way to overcome the shortcoming of a slow charging time in distributed battery cells, which {{is regarded as a}} connection of cells such as the Internet of Things (IoT). The pulse frequency for controlling the battery charge duration is dynamically controlled within a certain range in order to inject the <b>maximum</b> <b>charge</b> <b>current</b> into the battery cells. The optimal frequency is determined in order to minimize battery impedance. The adaptation of the proposed pulse duty and frequency decreases the concentration of the polarization by sensing the runtime characteristics of battery cells so that it guarantees a certain level of safety in charging the distributed battery cells within the operating temperature range of 5 – 45 °C. The sensed terminal voltage and temperature of battery cells are dynamically monitored while the battery is charging so as to adjust the frequency and duty of the proposed charging pulse method, thereby preventing battery degradation. The evaluation results show that a newly designed charging algorithm for the implemented charger system is about 18. 6 % faster than the conventional constant-current (CC) charging method with the temperature rise within a reasonable range.

The enormous beam power dictates that the beam current {{be returned to the}} high voltage terminal which provides the accelerating potential. The beam is returned to a carefully designed collector within the terminal and biased a few kV positive with respect to it. Thus the load on the HV supply is only the accelerating potential times the sum of the beam current loss and the current used to maintain a graded potential on the accelerating structure.

The EVSE starts in state A and applies +12 V to the control pilot. On detecting 2.74 kΩ across CP and PE, the EVSE moves to state B, and applies a 1 kHz ±12 V peak-to-peak square wave pilot signal. The EV can then request charging by changing the resistance across CP and PE to 246 Ω or 882 Ω (with and without ventilation, respectively); if the EV requests ventilation, the EVSE will only enable charging if it is in a ventilated area. The EVSE communicates the <b>maximum</b> available <b>charging</b> <b>current</b> to the EV by pulse width modulation of the pilot signal: 16% duty cycle is 10 A, 25% is 16 A, 50% is 32 A, and 90% flags a fast charge option.

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry requires electric vehicle battery systems to maintain specified performance for an 8 year life cycle. However, {{it has been}} shown for Li-ion batteries that the capacity loss after a 1 year operation is approximately 3 %, and the power loss is approximately 8 %. This is primarily due to battery internal resistance increasing over time caused by growth in SEI film thickness and a reduction in electrode adhesion. In this study, data were collected from a commercial hybrid electric vehicle battery system running at operating-mode conditions over a period of 1 year. In total, approximately 340, 000 data samples were recorded. Of these data, about 92 % discharge current was less than 50 A and the peak at 150 A; about 97 % <b>charge</b> <b>current</b> was less than 75 A and the peak at 120 A.
