25|$|Geoengineering: {{planetary}} engineering applied {{specifically to}} Earth. It includes only those <b>macroengineering</b> concepts {{that deal with}} the alteration of some global parameter, such as the greenhouse effect, atmospheric composition, insolation or impact flux.|$|E
50|$|In {{engineering}}, macro-engineering (alternatively {{known as}} <b>macroengineering</b> or macro engineering and as mega engineering) is {{the implementation of}} extremely large-scale design projects. It {{can be seen as}} a branch of civil engineering or structural engineering but just on a very large land area. In particular, macro-engineering is the process of marshaling and managing of resources, technology and public opinion on a large scale to carry out complex tasks that last over a long period.|$|E
30|$|The {{ideas of}} {{frequency}} and frequency response are well {{developed in the}} context of wireless communication and <b>macroengineering.</b> However, {{in the context of}} MC, the notions of frequency and frequency response are not yet well defined; hence, there is knowledge gap that needs to be filled before well-articulated frequency domain analyses of MC systems can be made in the general literature. In this subsection, we shall attempt to provide some verifiable frequency and frequency response concepts in MC systems.|$|E
40|$|Macro-engineering {{involves}} the large-scale modification and manipulation of natural {{systems for the}} benefit of mankind. Some of the major applications of macro-engineering are power production, land reclamation, food production, climate change, environment, water, transport, coastal protection and the protection against (future) disasters. Several of these applications may come together within the same project, and environmental aspects are invariably part of it. Examples of macro-engineering will be briefly discussed, mainly {{to find out more about}} the kind of problems such macro-projects can cause and possible mitigating measures that can be taken to reduce their impact. Although the definition of macro-engineering given above states that it is {{for the benefit of}} mankind, each individual project will be in general benefit for only a part of mankind. Finding out which parties benefit the most from a particular project makes it easier to assess the most likely sources of funding. climate change; coastal protection; energy; environmental impact; food production; transport; water; power generation; <b>macroengineering</b> projects; disaster prevention; land reclamation; macro-engineering. ...|$|E
40|$|Humanity {{stands at}} the {{threshold}} of exploiting the known lunar resources that have opened up with the access to space. America's role in the future exploitation of space, and specifically of lunar resources, may well determine the level of achievement in technology development and global economic competition. Space activities during the coming decades will significantly influence the events on Earth. The 'shifting of history's tectonic plates' is a process that will be hastened by the increasingly insistent demands for higher living standards of the exponentially growing global population. Key to the achievement of a peaceful world in the 21 st century, will be the development of a mix of energy resources at a societally acceptable and affordable cost within a realistic planning horizon. This must be the theme for the globally applicable energy sources that are compatible with the Earth's ecology. It is in this context that lunar resources development should be a primary goal for science missions to the Moon, and for establishing an expanding human presence. The economic viability and commercial business potential of mining, extracting, manufacturing, and transporting lunar resource based materials to Earth, Earth orbits, and to undertake <b>macroengineering</b> projects on the Moon remains to be demonstrated. These extensive activities will be supportive of the realization of the potential of space energy sources for use on Earth. These may include generating electricity for use on Earth based on beaming power from Earth orbits and from the Moon to the Earth, and for the production of helium 3 as a fuel for advanced fusion reactors...|$|E
