40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show whether the <b>monetisation</b> <b>of</b> {{employee}} s remuneration has any effect on productivity. It should be appreciated that productivity is influenced by an infinite number of factors, one of which could be the <b>monetisation</b> <b>of</b> the remuneration of workers by their employers. In order to e stablish the "pure effects " of one variable, all the others have to be controlled. However, neither the data nor the information used, in this paper, will justifY the level of statistical analysis needed to establish causality. Consequently, "implication", as used in this paper, should be interpreted more in terms of 'associational 'than "causal" relationships. This paper examines the effect of remuneration on the employees productivity. It reviews the purpose of ·the policy and the mechanism for achieving it in the economy, in a way capable of resolving disputes in industrial relations and ensuring proper evaluation of employees remuneration without ignoring the cost benefits implication <b>of</b> <b>monetisation,</b> on the employer of labour. The paper examines, the courses of productivity growth, vis-a-vis, the relationship between productivity and other variables, such as employment wages, prices and <b>monetisation</b> <b>of</b> workers' benefits. The paper, further examines the various inadequacies and the benefits <b>of</b> <b>monetisation</b> <b>of</b> employees renumeration. The study concludes, that, adequate measures should be taken in order to ensure, that, the policy does not lead to massive fraud, corruption, capital flight and the exploitation of the weak by the strong, among other things...|$|R

40|$|The thesis explores how <b>monetisation</b> <b>of</b> {{corporate}} externalities, can {{be carried}} out in order to provide investors, policy makers and consumers with accurate pictures of the true costs and benefits of business operations from a resilience and ecosystem services perspective. By drawing conclusions from company cases, and previous research – methods, drivers and monetary values of impacts such as carbon dioxide, water usage, pollutants and land use are analysed. The findings reflect opportunities that open up with <b>monetisation,</b> in terms <b>of</b> tools for guidance and support in internal corporate decision making, by making the actual impacts visualised and understandable. Findings from company cases, show that <b>monetisation</b> <b>of</b> corporate effects has potential to contribute to visualising impacts – and add knowledge that may close information gaps internally as well as externally. It can guide and facilitate strategic choices at corporate level. It may also have a role in bridging information asymmetries in the picture of a firm’s operation, to consumers and investors. Monetising effects may facilitate identification of risks arising from ecosystem services dependencies, visualising the actual impacts by, assed costs in losses in ecosystems’ production (yields e. g.) caused by corporate harm. Providing relevant information to policy makers, on obstacles and where regulative incentives are needed, and investors and consumers with guidance, <b>monetisation</b> <b>of</b> impacts potentially can play a part in bridging market information gaps toward better incentive structures and possibly facilitating effective market transformation in favor of sustainable production and consumption patterns...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} the {{correlation}} <b>of</b> <b>monetisation,</b> socialisation and capitalisation processes {{remains one of the}} most urgent problems of the modern national economic system. Its relevance is mediated by actual expression of the contradictions in the correlation of economic and social aspects. Thus, the subject of the analysis in this article is the definition of the specificity <b>of</b> interrelation <b>of</b> <b>monetisation,</b> capitalisation, and socialisation of the national economic system. The object of the research is represented by the factors affecting the dynamics of the processes <b>of</b> <b>monetisation,</b> capitalisation, and socialisation in the context of the definition of their determination. The purpose of the study is to structure the processes <b>of</b> <b>monetisation,</b> socialisation and capitalisation of the national economic system by their aggregation. The reproduction of logical and functional economic and mathematical models <b>of</b> determining <b>monetisation,</b> capitalisation, and socialisation processes has been examined. General theoretical research methods are logical and functional sequence of reproduction stages of analysis and synthesis; comparison, abstraction and generalization; induction and deduction; reproduction, almost true abstraction; theoretical and practical unity, universality of ascent from the abstract to the concrete. Specific research methods are represented by commonly accepted econometric techniques of regression analysis of the determined models of the interrelation of the aforementioned processes as well as testing their significance. The article deals with the logic of socioeconomic development within the framework of the determination of extended and restricted reproduction of the processes <b>of</b> <b>monetisation,</b> capitalisation and socialisation. A systematic approach, with the application of basic methodologies of the economic and mathematical modelling is used to discuss the interrelation of the above-mentioned processes <b>of</b> <b>monetisation,</b> capitalisation and socialisation and the conclusion about their determination is drawn. Resulting from this the general type of the synthesized forecasting model of interrelation between the processes <b>of</b> <b>monetisation,</b> capitalisation and socialisation as well as of corresponding specific structures was determined. The general conclusion of the article is the creation of synthesized forecasting model between interrelation of the processes <b>of</b> <b>monetisation,</b> capitalisation and socialisation as well as researching trend dependence of the specific structures of the abovementioned processes, which allowed to draw the conclusion regarding the interrelation of the aforementioned processes, and their overall functional dependence on the time factor (which corresponds to the necessity of inclusion of lag structures in the study of the interrelation). A system of forecasting equations is obtained as the result, where the first corresponds to the influence of specific structures of the processes of capitalisation and socialisation on the dynamics of the process <b>of</b> <b>monetisation,</b> the second is the impact of specific structures of the processes <b>of</b> <b>monetisation</b> and socialisation on the dynamics of the process of capitalisation, and the third – the impact of specific structures of the processes <b>of</b> <b>monetisation</b> and capitalisation on the dynamics of the socialisation process.

Finally, the inclusion of trans-national corporations in the theory of money emissions allows us to redefine transnational production as an additional conceptual level in monetary macroeconomics, with far-reaching implications as far as the <b>monetisation</b> <b>of</b> trans-national production and the subsequent reform of international payments are concerned. trans-national corporations, Bernard Schmitt, Monetary Theory of Production...|$|R

Instead, it relies on a quid pro quo of debts performed by means of discounting whereby a regime of fluid property relations of mutual indebtedness, commonly known as debt finance, is established.

40|$|This paper compares and {{contrasts}} rural livelihoods in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Malawi, {{with a view}} to informing rural {{poverty reduction}} policies within Poverty Reduction Strategy Plans (PRSPs). Low household incomes in rural areas of all countries are associated with low land and livestock holdings, high reliance on food crop agriculture, and low <b>monetisation</b> <b>of</b> the rural economy. These adverse factors are in some instances made more difficult by land sub-division at inheritance, declining civil security in rural areas, deteriorating access to proper agronomic advice and inputs, and predatory taxation by decentralised district councils. Better off households are distinguished by virtuous spirals of accumulation typically involving diverse livestock ownership, engagement in non-farm self-employment, and diversity of on-farm and non-farm income sources. Lessons for PRSPs centre on the creation of a facilitating, rather than blocking, public sector environment for the multiplication of non-farm enterprises; seeking creative solutions to the spread of technical advice to farmers; and examining critically the necessity for, and impact of, tax revenue collection by district councils on rural incomes and enterprise. ...|$|R
