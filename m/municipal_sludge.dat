In conjunction with these applications, information has been collected concerning sludge quantity and characteristics, soil parameters, soil water constituents, groundwater quality, surface runoff water quality, and various chemical constituents in vegetation on application sites. This information provides (1) a record of sludge application on the DOE reservations and (2) documentation of changes in soil parameters following sludge application.

This awareness in combination with the variety of factors influencing the optimal management strategy and disposal route, introduces the need to optimise the sludge treatment throughout the whole chain instead of only minimising its production. In this paper, OPTIMASS, a mixed integer linear programming model to optimise strategic and tactical decisions in biomass-based supply chains, is proposed in order to meet this need. The applicability of OPTIMASS is illustrated through its implementation with a view to minimise the overall global warming impact of a real <b>municipal</b> wastewater <b>sludge</b> processing chain in “region X”.
