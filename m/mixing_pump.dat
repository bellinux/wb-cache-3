The machine is essentially a <b>mixing</b> <b>pump</b> which mixes the product with water and pumps the paste to a nozzle which sprays it onto the wall. The wet paste is than levelled off. Application of render using a machine is usually a much faster operation than by hand, meaning that larger areas can be rendered during a working day.|$|E

These engines typically use the forward piston to control both intake and exhaust ports, with the interesting result that the carburettor is at the front of the engine, under and to the side of the exhaust. The rear piston controls the transfer port from the crankshaft to the cylinder. Increasingly, these models were fitted with an oil <b>mixing</b> <b>pump,</b> fed from a reservoir incorporated in the petrol tank. Some also have a twin-spark plug ignition system firing an almost figure-eight shaped combustion chamber. Sears marketed considerable numbers of the Puch SGS split-single fitted with both these innovations as the [...] "Allstate 250" [...] or [...] "Twingle" [...] in the US. The improvements tamed, if not virtually eliminated, the previous problem of two-stroke plug fouling. A total of 38,584 Puch 250 SGS motorcycles were produced between 1953 and 1970. Puch gave up racing in the 1950s, and split-single production ended around 1970, but the machines themselves remain well-regarded and collectable.|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide Project W- 236 A, Multi-function Waste Tank Facility, (MWTF) Project File documentation on the selection of the heat removal capability that MWTF Tank Ventilation Systems will be designed to remove. This information is necessary for designing a heat removal system to prevent the thermal limits of the tank structure from being exceeded. It is important to note that this paper is not for defining the tank mixer pump requirements, but is to be only used for defining and defending the normal heat generation rate that the ventilation system and other heat removal systems will be designed to remove. There are three main heat loads in the tanks of which two can be controlled to a certain extent through operational considerations. These two are <b>mixing</b> <b>pump</b> heat and heat of chemical addition. The third heat source is radionuclide content which can only be controlled by what wastes are pumped to the tank and whether it is diluted prior to pumping.

The three analytes are adequate as screening indicators of soluble species homogeneity for tank waste when a <b>mixing</b> <b>pump</b> is used to thoroughly mix the waste in the waste feed staging tank and when all dissolved species are present at concentrations well below their solubility limits. If either of these conditions is violated, then the three indicators may not be sufficiently chemically representative of other waste constituents to reliably indicate homogeneity in the feed supernatant. Additional homogeneity indicators that should be considered are anions such as fluoride, sulfate, and phosphate, total organic carbon/total inorganic carbon, and total alpha to estimate the transuranic species. Physical property measurements such as gamma profiling, conductivity, specific gravity, and total suspended solids are recommended as possible at-tank methods for indicating homogeneity.

GFSSP is a finite volume based network flow analysis software developed at MSFC and used for thermo-fluid analysis of propulsion systems. GFSSP has been used to model the self-pressurization and ullage pressure control by Thermodynamic Vent System (TVS). A TVS typically includes a Joule-Thompson (J-T) expansion device, a two-phase heat exchanger, and a <b>mixing</b> <b>pump</b> and spray to extract thermal energy from the tank without significant loss of liquid propellant.

However, it is generally agreed to define rheology in terms of yield stress and plastic viscosity (Banfill 2006).

The WTP broadly classifies waste it receives {{in terms of}} “Envelopes,” each with different limiting properties and composition ranges. Envelope A, B, and C wastes are liquids that can include up to 4 % entrained solids that can be pumped directly from the staging DST without mixing. Envelope D waste contains insoluble solids and must be mixed before transfer. The mixing and sampling issues lie within Envelope D solid-liquid slurries. The question is how effectively these slurries are mixed and how representative the grab samples are that are taken immediately after mixing. This report summarizes {{the current state of}} knowledge concerning jet mixing of wastes in underground storage tanks. Waste feed sampling requirements are listed, and their apparent assumption of uniformity by lack of a requirement for sample representativeness is cited as a significant issue.
