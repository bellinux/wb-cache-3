The interns <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> in the surgery, and Harris is seriously endangered, but is rescued by the residents. The interns are put on probation and rebuked by Meredith Grey, although Harris tells Lexie Grey that she is not apologetic. Following the surgery fiasco, Harris approaches the hospital's chief of surgery Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), and claims responsibility for the incident. He informs her that the reason she has not been fired is because of his personal friendship with her father.|$|E
5|$|Young Como started {{helping his}} family at age 10, working {{before and after}} school in Steve Fragapane's barber shop for 50¢ a week. By age 13, he had {{graduated}} to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although he stood on a box to tend to his customers. It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did not come out until hunger {{got the better of}} him. He managed to tell his father {{what had happened to the}} money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and that he hoped his son would never do anything worse than this. When Perry was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe heart condition. Como and his brothers became the support of the household.|$|E

25|$|Seam bowling is the act {{of using}} the seam of the ball to cause the ball to bounce in an {{unpredictable}} fashion when it hits the pitch. A good batsman {{will be able to}} predict where a ball is going to bounce and from that work out what height the ball will be when it reaches him or her.

Lucifer complies, but then realizes that he cannot take Constantine to Hell as a consequence. By selflessly sacrificing himself, Constantine is granted entry to Heaven. Infuriated, Lucifer heals Constantine's injuries and cures him of his lung cancer, hoping he will eventually <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and damn himself again.

Near heads the SPK (Special Provision for Kira), an American investigation team composed of CIA and FBI agents, while Mello teams up with the Mafia. Although Mello dies working separate from Near, his actions lead Teru Mikami, a man selected by Light to kill criminals using another Death Note, to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> that results in Light's capture by Near, the SPK and Japanese police.

25|$|However, {{in almost}} all cases we are {{involved}} in the world in an ordinary, and more involved, way. We are usually doing things with a view to achieving something. Take for example, a hammer: it is ready-to-hand; we use it without theorizing. In fact, if we were to look at it as present-at-hand, we might easily <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> Only when it breaks or something goes wrong might we see the hammer as present-at-hand, just lying there. Even then however, it may be not fully present-at-hand, as it is now showing itself as something to be repaired or disposed, and therefore a part of the totality of our involvements. In this case its Being may be seen as unreadiness-to-hand. Heidegger outlines three manners of unreadiness-to-hand: Conspicuous (damaged; e.g., a lamp's wiring has broken), Obtrusive (a part is missing which is required for the entity to function; e.g., we find the bulb is missing), Obstinate (when the entity is a hindrance to us in pursuing a project; e.g., the lamp blocks my view of the computer screen).|$|E
25|$|Chaz Mostert {{took his}} first V8 Supercar pole {{position}} when he qualified fastest for the first race of the Ubet Perth Super Sprint. His teammate Mark Winterbottom qualified second {{and went on to}} score pole position for the second race. Winterbottom made a better start than Mostert in the first race and the pair went on to finish first and second, while Craig Lowndes finished in third. Jamie Whincup, after qualifying in 21st place, managed to finish in 15th place but lost the championship lead to Lowndes. Winterbottom won the second race ahead of Whincup and Fabian Coulthard. With Lowndes finishing fifth, Winterbottom took the championship lead. Mostert took his second pole in qualifying for the Sunday race. The session saw Lee Holdsworth <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> at turn six and his car rolled onto its side after digging into the sand trap. Despite starting off the front row, Mostert and Winterbottom finished fourth and 15th respectively after their tyre strategy was ruined by a safety car on lap 48. Will Davison won the race, taking Erebus Motorsport's second ever victory, after passing Lowndes for the lead with five laps remaining. Coulthard finished third despite starting 24th. With Winterbottom finishing down the order, Lowndes left the event with the championship lead.|$|E

But thanks to Amy's tutelage and my time with the national team, I was becoming a much better tactical goalkeeper. I learned how to read my opponents' runs toward goal, how to position my defenders, how to see the angles... The intellectual side also made goalkeeping so much more interesting. It wasn't just ninety minutes of waiting for my defense to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> It was ninety minutes of tactics and strategy.
