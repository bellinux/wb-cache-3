5000|$|Early January 1996 - prison {{officers}} found {{parts of}} the grill from a cell window in the cell yard, and subsequently found a rope and six-inch <b>masonry</b> <b>nail</b> in a cell. A prisoner was initially charged with attempting to escape, which was later reduced to damaging prison property for which he received a 21-day extension to his sentence.|$|E
50|$|A {{drilling}} hammer, club hammer, lump hammer, crack hammer, mini-sledge or thor hammer {{is a small}} sledgehammer whose relatively {{light weight}} and short handle allow single-handed use. It is useful for light demolition work, driving <b>masonry</b> <b>nails,</b> and for use with a steel chisel when cutting stone or metal. In this last application, its weight drives the chisel more deeply into the material being cut than lighter hammers. Club hammers are common on the British inland waterways for driving mooring pins into the towpath or canal bank.|$|R
5000|$|Centennial Olympic Park was {{designed}} as the [...] "town square" [...] of the Olympics, and thousands of spectators had gathered for a late concert by the band Jack Mack and the Heart Attack. Sometime after midnight, Rudolph planted a green U.S. military ALICE pack (field pack) containing three pipe bombs surrounded by 3 in <b>masonry</b> <b>nails,</b> which caused most of the human injuries, underneath a bench near {{the base of a}} concert sound tower. He then left the area. The pack had a directed charge and could have done more damage but it was slightly moved at some point. It used a steel plate as a directional device. Investigators would later tie the Sandy Springs and Otherside bombs together with this first device because all were propelled by nitroglycerin dynamite, used an alarm clock and Rubbermaid containers, and contained steel plates.|$|R
50|$|Tilt-up {{construction}} requires significant {{organization and}} collaboration {{on the building}} site. The chronological steps {{that need to be}} taken for a tilt-up project are: site evaluation, engineering, footings and floor slabs, forming tilt-up panels, steel placement, embeds and inserts, concrete placement, panel erection and panel finishing. Once the pad (casting surface or floor slab) has cured, forms are built on top. Dimensional lumber, a high quality plywood or fiber board that has at least one smooth face is typically used, although aluminum or steel forms are also common. Carpenters work from engineered drawings designed for each panel or element to construct on site. They incorporate all door and window openings, as well as architectural features and other desired shapes that can be molded into the concrete. Studs, gussets and attachment plates are located within the form for embedding in the concrete. The forms are usually anchored to the casting surface with <b>masonry</b> <b>nails</b> or otherwise adhered to prevent damage to the floor slab.|$|R
50|$|The {{slitting}} mill, {{introduced to}} England in 1590, simplified {{the production of}} nail rods, but the real first efforts to mechanise the nail-making process itself occurred between 1790 and 1820, initially in the United States and England, when various machines were invented to automate and {{speed up the process}} of making nails from bars of wrought iron. These nails were known as cut nails or square nails because of their roughly rectangular cross section. Cut nails were one of the important factors in the increase in balloon framing beginning in the 1830s and thus the decline of timber framing with wooden joints. Though still used for historical renovations, and for heavy-duty applications, such as attaching boards to <b>masonry</b> walls, cut <b>nails</b> are much less common today than wire nails.|$|R
