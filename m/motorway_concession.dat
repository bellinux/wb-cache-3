The A8 expansion was commenced by the operator, BINA Istra, immediately following a similar expansion of the A9; on the latter, the entire route was widened except for the two largest bridges, for which the expansion was postponed. The expansion of the A8 was initially limited to the Kanfanar–Rogovići section because the remainder of the route required additional permits and consequently an extended preparation period. On 29 October 2011, the Kanfanar–Rogovići section was upgraded to motorway standards, including four traffic lanes, and the route's designation changed from B8 to A8 (as required by legislated standards). The construction performed along the section entailed deep and long cuts requiring temporary traffic stoppages due to explosive blasting.|$|E

40|$|Budgetary {{constraints}} are prompting many {{governments to}} encourage private financing of transportation infrastructure through concession contracts. The length {{and complexity of}} such contracts often force governments to provide fiscal support {{in order to increase}} the attractiveness of concessions. This paper deals with a new public support mechanism for concession contracts, called Subordinated Public Participation Loans (SPPLs), which has been implemented in Spain during the last few years. SPPLs are subordinated loans that may be given by the government to the concessionaire if the latter requests them in the tender. SPPLs are defined {{in such a way that}} the increase in interest accrued will reflect the traffic level: the larger the traffic the larger will be the SPPL yield. SPPLs have a twofold goal. First, they increase the financial attractiveness, and hence the feasibility, of concessions contracts. And second, they set up a fairer risksharing approach between the public and the private sector. This paper analyzes the implications of SPPLs in <b>motorway</b> <b>concessions</b> by contrasting the theoretical analysis with the empirical results obtained form the tender of five <b>motorway</b> <b>concessions</b> in Spain. Overall we found that the implementation of this mechanism may be considered a success. In spite of that, we propose some measures that may contribute to improving the SPPL performance in the future...|$|R

The level of overestimation in Spain is even greater than that reported by other studies based on worldwide data. The notorious levels of overestimation entail severe burdens to the economics of the concessionaires that often prompt renegotiations of the contracts, which are often accepted by the government. These renegotiations usually end up with toll changes or extension of the concession terms, which have to be ultimately borne by future motorway users.

In addition, we found that unlike what happens with annual traffic volumes, traffic growth rates are mostly underestimated by concessionaires in the ramp-up period. We explain this trend towards overestimation in the strategic behaviour of the bidders in the tender rather than in systematic modelling errors. The cause of this strategic behaviour lies in the willingness to renegotiate as shown by the government of Spain when actual traffic turns out to be lower than expected...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFive <b>motorway</b> <b>concession</b> {{contracts}} are currently under implementation in Greece. The total investment amounts to 8. 7 billion €. The completion of projects construction was foreseen by 2014. Following the recent financial crisis, the traffic volume has decreased {{and the market}} interest rates and country's investment risk have increased considerably. Construction works are currently subject to delay due to time-consuming administrative procedures, which has resulted in claims by constructors and concessionaires. Furthermore, users apparently perceive the toll rates as being expensive; some of them refuse to pay. The results of the updated financial models show loss of contracts’ long term financial equilibrium. In this environment, the Lending Banks have imposed a payment drawdown stop on four out of the five concessions.

40|$|Russia has a {{well-developed}} {{and powerful}} transportation system. However, the entire transpon infrastructure {{was designed to}} meet the needs of a closed and centralized economy. It has become clear that the current road network does not fillfill Russia's social and economic needs. The growth of Russia's road network has fallen far behind motorization rates and the growing demand for road transportation. This gap is a result of the low level of investment in road infrastructure, especially during the last decade. The lack of an adequate stock of roads is particularly evident in Moscow, leading to extremely high traffic congestión, with adverse consequences in terms of wasted time, air pollution, noise, climatic effects, etc. Increased investment in road infrastructure is necessary to reduce Moscow's road congestión. To this end, in addition to increasing public investment, it would be helpful to involve the prívate sector by means of public-private partnerships (PPP). This paper analyses the issues surrounding road concessions and the challenges and difficulties of using a PPP model in Russia. First, the study analyses data on the evolution of the road network and of transport demand in Russia over the last decade. These data illustrate the difficulties of maintaining the road network and of responding to the growing transport demand. Then the paper reviews the challenges of PPP projects aimed at improving the road network, focusing on two recently granted <b>motorway</b> <b>concessions</b> near Moscow. Finally, prospects for further development of public-private partnerships to relieve road congestión in the Russian capital are explored...|$|R
40|$|In a road {{infrastructure}} concession, a public authority grants specific {{rights to a}} private, or semi-public company to construct, overhaul, maintain, and operate infrastructure for a given period. By contract, the public authority charges that company with making the investments needed to create the service at its own cost, and to operate it at its own risk. The price paid to the company comes from the service's users, the public authority, or both. In 1999, out of roughly 51, 000 kilometers of European motorways, about 17, 000 kilometers (33 percent) were concessioned - 16, 400 kilometers by toll, and 670 kilometers by shadow toll (design, build, finance, and operate arrangements). Of these, 73 percent are managed by the public sector, and 27 percent by private companies. State-owned companies have been important in European <b>motorway</b> <b>concessions.</b> Systems vary among countries, for example, in how they share risks between the concession authority, and the concession company. As the motorway network has grown denser, attributing commercial risk has become more difficult. Increasingly, public authorities must play a greater regulatory role. Already, bad experiences have made the private sector reluctant to bear the commercial risk. Ant the commercial risk is sometimes too great to be carried by the concession company alone. Commercial risk should be controlled by mechanisms incorporated in the contract, but control of the commercial risk must not eliminate incentives. In addition to safeguarding the community's interests, the public concession authority, must increase citizen awareness about concession decisions, to ensure their social acceptability. Formulas for determining toll charges, differ through Europe. So do criteria for selecting concession companies. In 1999, the main criteria used were these: 1) the amount of public subsidy required; 2) {{the credibility of the}} financial arrangements; 3) the project's technical quality; 4) the operating strategy, and price policy; and, 5) the reputation of the concession company (whether it has a construction company among its shareholders, for example).

50|$|Until {{the early}} 1980s, the Portuguese {{motorways}} {{did not have}} a proper number, each being referred to by a name (with some sections that were part of a estrada nacional also using the respective Nxx number). The existing motorways at that time (all of them managed under concession) started to receive a proper number of the type Axx. With the application of the PRN 1985, new motorways were built with a few of them being managed directly by the national road agency JAE and not under concession like the others. So, although all motorways were part of an IP or IC, only concessionated ones received the Axx number (whether tolled or not), this latter number being signalized and the IPxx or ICxx number being ignored in the motorway signage. The other motorways - non-concessionated, and therefore, always non-tolled - were signalized with the IPxx or ICxx number. Because, until the 2000s, almost all <b>motorways</b> under <b>concession</b> were tolled, in that time, the existence or not of a signed Axx number helped the drivers to know in advance if a motorway was tolled or not.|$|R

There is today no unequivocal answer to this question. We observe a diversity of perceptions and practices that is partly linked to the uncertainties about the management of this plant. There is a need of knowledge relating to these perceptions and practices towards Japanese knotweed s. l. along the linear transport infrastructures, as well as the reasons that lead to this diversity of attitudes.

40|$|Electronic {{transactions}} {{are becoming increasingly}} commonplace in the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, despite the collapse of many dotcom firms {{and the failure of}} e-commerce to make inroads in the region. In the transport sphere, the gradual incorporation of technology in support of processes and the exchange of money flows between players has brought greater versatility, security and flexibility.

40|$|Italy is the nation, in Europe and {{the rest}} of the world, with the {{greatest}} tradition and experience in the construction and management of motorway infrastructure financed through the tolling system. Accordingly, our country has faced many of the problems and issues that are today of current interest in the European Community well before other countries have, availing itself of professional help both from the motorway sector as well as from the academic one. This professional help is not only based on abstract theories but rather on experience that has been acquired on the field. It thus seems only natural that Aiscat, in representation of the operators of the Italian <b>motorway</b> network in <b>concession,</b> should have commissioned a report on the external costs of transport, a subject which, further to its inclusion in European directive no. 2006 / 38, and the deadlines set by the European Parliament, has become of current interest; no longer therefore only a matter of academic discussion, but rather an important element and parameter of assessment for European Transport Policy. Although representing the motorway sector, Aiscat has taken into consideration the valuable indications provided by the European Authorities concerning the need of not limiting the analysis to external costs vis-à-vis individual modes of transport but rather coherently analyse these modes in terms of mobility and transport as a whole. Based on the above understanding and approach, this report has been prepared with the support of Prometeia- a highly qualified research and consulting firm-, and the contribution of export researchers whose background and skills guarantee the rigour and depth of analysis that were the key to this work from the very outset. I am therefore pleased and honoured to make this report available to all those who shall take part in establishing a common position on the subject, and trust that this contribution may help deal with all open issues in an analytical and rigorous manner, as should rightly be expected for all projects destined to affect the future of Europe and its people...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to study the sources of discrepancy between the actual traffic in <b>motorways</b> under <b>concession</b> schemes and the traffic forecast ex-ante. The demand forecast for a specific project is the main variable influencing its realization. From a public sector perspective, socio-economic evaluations are driven by demand forecasts, which gives the basis for choose and hierarchy public projects in order to maximise social welfare. From a private sector perspective, traffic forecasts are the base of financial evaluation and toll setting. Despite its importance and the numerous and important developments in the field, the differences of forecast and ex-post traffic are usually very high. Some recent studies show that differences as big as 20 % are much more the rule than the exception. A huge amount of uncertainty {{is associated with the}} forecasting exercise. First because transport is a derived demand and depends on many exogenous variables, also uncertain; because modelling is and simplification exercise, implies many assumptions and rely on field data, many times incomplete or of low quality; moreover, modelling human (in this case users) behaviour is always a dangerous enterprise. Although these arguments could explain at least the larger part of errors associated with forecasts, one can wonder whether the agents implicated in the forecast would or could use this uncertainty strategically in their favour. In a competition for the field scheme (bids), the bidder may overestimate the demand {{in order to reduce the}} toll included in the bid. This strategic behaviour can introduce a high bias in forecasts. Also, overoptimistic (or overpessimistic) forecasters may introduce a bias in the forecast. We propose to focus in turn on the three main groups of agents involved in the demand forecast process. The forecasters, the project promoters and the users. Study all the issues related to them would be a too ambitious (or more concretely impossible) task. We then focus on some particular issues related to the modelling of the actors' behaviour in the context of the demand forecast for toll roads. Regarding the forecaster behaviour, we present the results of the first large sample survey on forecasters' perceptions and opinions about forecasting demand for transport projects, based on an on-line survey. We first describe the main characteristics of forecasters. We then describe the last forecast forecasters prepared. We turn to the models forecasters apply, the errors they declare on past forecasts and the main sources of errors according to them. We then describe the forecast environment in terms of pressure forecasters receive. These unique results provide a picture of the world of forecasters and forecasts, allowing for a better understanding of them. We turn then to the study of the optimism and overconfidence in transport forecasts. Optimism and overconfidence in general are recognized human traits. We analyze the overoptimistic bias by comparing the distribution of stated errors with actual errors found in literature; we also compare the own skilful of subjects in doing forecasts with studies showing self-evaluations of a common skill - driving. We finally propose a regression of the competence, quality and errors on the main forecasters' and projects' specific variables. Results show that the distribution of errors transport forecasters state has a smaller average magnitude and a smaller variance than those found in literature. Comparing forecasters perception of their own competence with the results found in literature about drivers skill self-evaluation, however, we could not find a significant difference, meaning that the forecasters' overconfidence is in line with what could be viewed as a normal human overconfidence level. The pressure for results forecasters receive and the strategic manipulation they affirm exist merit a special attention. They imply that while forecasters' behavioural biases may exist and should be take in account when evaluation forecasts, the project promoter may influence forecasts by pressuring the forecasters to produce results which better fit his expectancies. We then study the bidders' strategic behaviour in auctions for road concessions. We address three questions in turn. First, we investigate the overall effects of the winner's curse on bidding behaviour in such auctions. Second, we examine the effects of the winner's curse on contract auctions with differing levels of common-value components. Third, we investigate how the winner's curse affects bidding behaviour in such auctions when we account for the possibility for bidders to renegotiate. Using a unique, self-constructed, dataset of 49 worldwide road concessions, we show that the winner's curse effect is particularly strong in toll road concession contract auctions. Thus, we show that bidders bid less aggressively in toll road concession auctions when they expect more competition. We observe that this winner's curse effect is even larger for projects where the common uncertainty is greater. Moreover, we show that the winner's curse effect is weaker when the likelihood of renegotiation is higher. While the traditional implication would be that more competition is not always desirable when the winner's curse is particularly strong, we show that, in toll road concession contract auctions, more competition may be always desirable. Modelling aggregated users' behaviour, we study the long term traffic maturity. We argue that traffic maturity results from decreasing marginal utility of transport. The elasticity of individual mobility with respect to the revenue decreases after a certain level of mobility is reached. In order to find evidences of decreasing elasticity we analyse a cross-section time-series sample including 40 French motorways' sections. This analysis shows that decreasing elasticity can be observed in the long term. We then propose a decreasing function for the traffic elasticity with respect to the economic growth, which depends on the traffic level on the road. Although “unconditional” decreasing elasticities were already proposed in the literature, this is the first work, as far as we know, putting this idea in evidence and giving it a functional form. This model provides better interpretation of the coupling between traffic and economic growth, and a better long-term forecast. From the disaggregate perspective, we study the main individual modal choice variable, the value of time. The value of travel time savings is a fundamental concept in transport economics and its size strongly affects the socio-economic evaluation of transport schemes. Financial assessment of tolled roads rely upon the value of time as the main (or even the unique) willingness to pay measure. Values of time estimates, which primarily represent behavioural values, as then increasingly been used as measures of out-of-pocket money. In this setting, one of the main issues regarding the value of time is its distribution over the population. We apply the Logit, the Mixed Logit and the Bayesian Mixed Logit models to estimate the value of time in freight transport in France. Estimations with mixed logit faced many difficulties, as expected. These difficulties could be avoided using the Bayesian procedures, providing also the opportunity of properly integrating a priori beliefs. Results show that 1) using a single constant value of time, representative of an average, can lead to demand overestimation, 2) the estimated average value of time of freight transport in France is about 45 Euro, depending on the load/empty and hire/own account variables, which implies that 3) the standard value recommended in France should be reviewed upwards. Cette thèse a pour objectif d'étudier les sources d'écart entre le trafic réel vérifié ex-post sur les autoroutes en concession et les prévisions ex-ante. La demande prévue pour un projet est la principale variable déterminant sa réalisation. Du point de vue du secteur public, les gains socio-économiques sont déterminés par les prévisions de la demande, ce que sert de base de choix et hiérarchisation des projets publics en vue de maximiser le bien-être social. Du point de vue du secteur privé, les prévisions de trafic sont à la base de l'évaluation financière et de la fixation du montant du péage. Malgré son importance et les nombreuses et importantes évolutions dans le domaine, les différences entre les prévisions et le trafic ex-post sont souvent très élevées. Des études récentes montrent que des différences de l'ordre que 20 % constituent plutôt la règle que l'exception. Une part d'incertitude très élevée est associée à l'exercice de prévision. D'abord parce que le transport est une demande dérivée et dépend de plusieurs variables exogènes, aussi incertaines; Parce que la modélisation est un exercice de simplification qui implique des nombreuses hypothèses et s'appuye sur des données de terrain, souvent incomplètes ou de mauvaise qualité; en outre, la modélisation du comportement humain (dans ce cas, les usagers) relève toujours du défis. Bien que ces arguments puissent expliquer au moins la plus grande partie des erreurs associées aux prévisions, on peut se demander si les agents impliqués dans les prévisions pourraient utiliser cette incertitude stratégiquement en leur faveur. On propose ici d'étudier les trois principaux groupes d'agents impliqués dans le processus de prévision de demande en transport, dans le cadre particulier d'une autoroute concédée (à péage) : les prévisionnistes, les enchérisseurs et les utilisateurs. L'étude de toutes les questions liées à leur comportement serait une tâche trop ambitieuse (ou plus concrètement impossible). Nous nous avons donc concentres sur certaines questions particulières liées à la modélisation du comportement des acteurs dans le contexte de la demande prévue pour les autoroutes à péage.
