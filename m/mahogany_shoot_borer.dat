5000|$|As a timber, both Swietenia macrophylla and Swietenia mahogoni {{are both}} grown in {{plantations}} in several Asian {{countries such as}} Fiji, Indonesia, India, and Bangladesh and this plantation mahogany timber is {{the main source of}} the world's current supply of [...] "genuine mahogany", due to cultivation and trade of it in its native locations being restricted by the Convention On International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna CITES since the late 1990s. Trade in Swietenia grown and harvested in these non-native locations is not restricted. Species of this genus are only occasionally plantation-grown in Central America, in spite of the good growing conditions and high price of the wood, due to the ubiquitous presence of the <b>mahogany</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> moth (also known as the cedar tip moth), Hypsipyla grandella, which damages the form of the tree by killing the terminal shoot, causing excessive branching. Control requires extensive and frequent spraying with pesticides, rendering the genus relatively uneconomic wherever the shoot borer is present.|$|E
40|$|Cedrela odorata is in {{many ways}} well suited to {{plantation}} silviculture.

The present paper reports on genetic variation in a shoot borer attacked clonal trial. We found significant provenance and clonal variation in several measures of final tree quality, all related to both form and growth. The results indicate the potential of genetic selection as an element of integrated management of mahogany shoot borers...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>mahogany</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> Hypsipyla grandella Zeller is an {{important}} economic pest in all American tropical forests, because it prevents monoculture of valuable timber trees species like mahogany and cedar. The shoot borer damages several tree structures, especially the apical shoots, impairing {{the formation of the}} commercial stem. This pest can attack the plants during the year and one larva per plant is enough to cause significant damage. In infested areas, the attack can reach up to 100 % of the trees. The Australian cedar and African mahogany have been cultivated in Brazil for timber production, because they are considered resistant to H. grandella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) attack. However, in this work we report {{for the first time the}} H. grandella attack to African mahogany Khaya ivorensis...|$|E
40|$|Khaya senegalensis is a {{multipurpose}} African timber species. The {{development of}} clonal propagation could improve plantation establishment, {{which is currently}} impeded by <b>mahogany</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>borer.</b> To examine its potential for clonal propagation, the effects of cutting length, leaf area, stockplant maturation, auxin, and smoke solution treatments were investigated. Leafy cuttings rooted well (up to 80 %) compared to leafless cuttings (0 %). Cuttings taken from seedlings rooted well (at least 95 %), but cuttings obtained from older trees rooted poorly (5 % maximum). The rooting ability of cuttings collected from older trees was improved (16 % maximum) by pollarding. Auxin application enhanced root length {{and the number of}} roots while smoke solution did not improve cuttings' rooting ability. These results indicate that juvenile K. senegalensis is amenable to clonal propagation, but further work is required to improve the rooting of cuttings from mature trees...|$|E

We review evidence for the existence of resistance to <b>shoot</b> <b>borers</b> in Meliaceae, with particular emphasis on research in Costa Rica on resistance to Hypsipyla grandelia in big-leaf mahogany and Spanish cedar. This research has shown appreciable genetic variation in resistance to attack by <b>shoot</b> <b>borers</b> in these tree species. Strategies for future research are discussed, and we conclude that the best option for successful <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> management lies in using resistant planting stock in silvicultural or agroforestry systems to encourage natural biological control or otherwise minimize the abundance and adverse effects of <b>shoot</b> <b>borers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{plantation}} silviculture of mahogany (Swietenia spp.) {{has been}} severely {{limited by the}} attack of the <b>mahogany</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> (Hypsipyla spp.), which greatly reduces or nullifies the commercial timber value of attacked trees by causing forking low on the stem. Selection for resistance, including tolerance (the capacity to retain apical dominance after attack), is widely considered to have potential as one element in an integrated pest management system. It {{has been suggested that}} the response of young seedlings to a predictive decapitation test might be useful as a means of detecting genotypes with high tolerance. This paper describes a pilot provenance/progeny experiment aimed at exploring this hypothesis. The number of shoots produced in response to attacks {{in the first year of}} field growth by Costa Rican material was found to be significantly correlated with response to decapitation in the nursery, on both individual tree and family mean bases. It appears, therefore, that the decapitation test could have a role in early selection for tolerance of Hypsipyla in mahogany. However, the presence of within-provenance genetic variation in response to Hypsipyla attack was not established...|$|E
40|$|Developing {{appropriate}} {{control measures}} for the <b>Mahogany</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>borer,</b> Hypsipyla robusta Moore {{has become increasingly}} important due to the severe damaging effect of the pest on {{the establishment of the}} saplings of Swietenia mahagoni Jacq (Sapindales: Meliaceae). Existing management methods are largely limited to silvicultural practices and spraying of chemical insecticides. To identify a potential fungal biocontrol agent, we compared the virulence of six native and two standard ARSEF isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae Metsch. against this pest. The average survival time and conidial yield of IWST-Ma 7 was higher (6. 2 to 7. 3 days and 4. 9 to 4. 7 × 105 conidia/ml) than the standards. Significant difference in sporulation on the cadavers between isolates, doses and incubation periods were substantiated for the selection of potential strain. The mycotoxic effects of crude soluble protein extract when incorporated in the artificial diet, the ARSEF 2596 and ARSEF 3603 showed LD 50 value of 3. 7 % and 5. 6 %. However, IWST-Ma 7 was highly lethal with significant lowest LD 50 value of 2. 6 %. The enzyme activity of IWST-Ma 7 was highest for chitinase, CDA, protease and lipase viz., 1. 90 U/mg, 1. 80 U/mg, 0. 98 U/mg and 0. 80 U/mg respectively. However the enzyme activity of chitinase and Chitin deacetylase assay for all the isolates was significantly higher than protease and lipase activity. The ITS regions (5. 8 S rDNA and 28 S rDNA) of seven isolates of M. anisopliae were amplified using the ITS 1 and ITS 4 primers which was a unique fragment of approximately 550 bp. Based on ITS regions, phylogenetic tree have been constructed and the isolates have been grouped in to 5 clades. The virulence and mycotoxic effects of different isolates could rationally be used to employ them for the management of the mahogany borer...|$|E
40|$|Swietenia macrophylla King (Meliaceae: Swietenioideae) {{provides}} one of {{the premier}} timbers of the world. The <b>mahogany</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>borer</b> Hypsipyla robusta Moore (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is an economically important pest of S. macrophylla throughout Asia, Africa and the Pacific. No viable method of controlling this pest is known. Previous observations have suggested that the presence of overhead shade may reduce attack by H. robusta, but this has not been investigated experimentally. This research was therefore designed to assess the influence of light availability on shoot-borer attack on S. macrophylla, by establishing seedlings under three different artificial shade regimes, then using these seedlings to test oviposition preference of adult moths, neonate larval survival and growth and development of shoot borer larvae. Oviposition preference of shoot borer moths was tested on leaves from seedlings grown under artificial shade for 63 weeks. A significant difference in choice was recorded between treatments, with 27. 4 ± 1. 5 eggs laid under high shade and 87. 1 ± 1. 8 under low shade. Neonate larval survival on early flushing leaflets of S. macrophylla did not differ significantly between shade treatments. Larval growth rate, estimated by measuring daily frass width, was significantly higher for those larvae fed on seedlings from the high and medium shade treatments (0. 1 mm/day), than the low shade treatment (0. 06 mm/day). In laboratory-reared larvae, the total mass of frass produced was significantly higher in the high shade treatment (0. 4 g) than under the low shade treatment (0. 2 g). Longer tunnel lengths were bored by larvae in plants grown under high shade (12. 0 ± 2. 4 cm) than under low shade (7. 07 ± 1. 9 cm). However, pupal mass under low shade was 48...|$|E

40|$|Cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) {{is a very}} {{important}} source of income for more than 200, 000 farmer households in Vietnam. The present cashew productivity in Vietnam is low and unstable, and pest damage is partly responsible for this. Cashew farmers rely on pesticides to minimize the damage, resulting in adverse impacts on farm environment and farmers’ health. Weaver ants (Oecophylla spp) are effective biocontrol agents of a range of cashew insect pests in several cashew-growing countries, and these ants are widely distributed in Vietnam. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the potential of weaver ants in cashew orchards in Vietnam. Field surveys and field experiment were conducted in five cashew orchards from July 2006 to January 2008 in Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, and Ba Ria Vung Tau provinces, Vietnam. Based on the field surveys, the most important pests that damage flushing foliar and floral shoots and young cashew fruits and nuts were mosquito bugs, brown <b>shoot</b> <b>borers,</b> blue <b>shoot</b> <b>borers,</b> and fruit-nut borers. The damage caused by each of these pests was significantly lower on trees with weaver ants compared with trees without the ants, showing that the ants were able to keep these pest damages under the control threshold. Regular monitoring of the field experiment showed that weaver ants were similar to insecticides for controlling mosquito bugs, blue <b>shoot</b> <b>borers,</b> fruit-nut borers, leaf rollers, and leaf miners.
