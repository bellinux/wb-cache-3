5|$|Schwimmer {{concluded}} in 2002 that the feeding patterns of Deinosuchus most likely varied by geographic location; the smaller Deinosuchus specimens of eastern North America {{would have been}} opportunistic feeders in an ecological niche {{similar to that of}} the modern American alligator. They would have consumed <b>marine</b> <b>turtles,</b> large fish, and smaller dinosaurs. The bigger, but less common, Deinosuchus that lived in Texas and Montana might have been more specialized hunters, capturing and eating large dinosaurs. Schwimmer noted no theropod dinosaurs in Deinosuchuss eastern range approached its size, indicating the massive crocodilian could have been the region's apex predator.|$|E

A secondary objective is to investigate two methodological issues about contingent valuation study: scope effect and payment vehicle effect. Using a uniform survey instrument and protocol, a sample of 3680 respondents from Beijing (China), Davao City (Philippines), Bangkok (Thailand) and Ho Chi Minh/Hanoi (Vietnam) were interviewed. Results indicate that the respondents in all cities have a positive willingness to pay for <b>marine</b> <b>turtle</b> conservation. The type of scope effect and payment vehicle effect considered did not seem to be significant in Beijing, Davao City and Bangkok.

5|$|The large {{populations of}} {{tortoises}} and <b>marine</b> <b>turtles</b> on Rodrigues {{resulted in the}} export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but the cats attacked the native birds and tortoises as well. The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. Rats are adept at crossing water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today. At least five species of Aplonis starlings have become extinct in islands of the Pacific Ocean, and rats also contributed to their demise.|$|E
5|$|Only 18 {{species of}} mammals {{are found in}} Bahrain, animals such as gazelles, desert rabbits and {{hedgehogs}} are common in the wild but the Arabian oryx was hunted to extinction on the island. 25 species of amphibians and reptiles were recorded as well as 21 species of butterflies and 307 species of flora. The marine biotopes are diverse and include extensive sea grass beds and mudflats, patchy coral reefs as well as offshore islands. Sea grass beds are important foraging grounds for some threatened species such as dugongs and the green turtle. In 2003, Bahrain banned the capture of sea cows, <b>marine</b> <b>turtles</b> and dolphins within its territorial waters.|$|E
5|$|Prey of cnidarians {{ranges from}} {{plankton}} to animals several {{times larger than}} themselves. Some cnidarians are parasites, mainly on jellyfish but a few are major pests of fish. Others obtain most of their nourishment from endosymbiotic algae or dissolved nutrients. Predators of cnidarians include: sea slugs, which can incorporate nematocysts into their own bodies for self-defense; starfish, notably the crown of thorns starfish, which can devastate corals; butterfly fish and parrot fish, which eat corals; and <b>marine</b> <b>turtles,</b> which eat jellyfish. Some sea anemones and jellyfish have a symbiotic relationship with some fish; for example clown fish live among the tentacles of sea anemones, and each partner protects the other against predators.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{behaviour}} of the Rodrigues starling, apart from Tafforet's description, from which various inferences can be made. The robustness of its limbs and the strong jaws with the ability to gape indicates that it foraged on the ground. Its diet may have consisted of the various snails and invertebrates of Rodrigues, as well as scavenged items. Rodrigues had large colonies of seabirds and now-extinct Cylindraspis land tortoises, as well as <b>marine</b> <b>turtles,</b> which would have provided a large amount of food for the starling, particularly during the breeding seasons. Tafforet reported that the pigeons and parrots on the offshore southern islets only came to the mainland to drink water, and Leguat noted that the pigeons only bred on the islets due to persecution from rats on the mainland; the starling may have also done this. Originally, the Rodrigues starling may have been widely distributed on Rodrigues, with seasonal visits to the islets. Tafforet's description also indicates that it had a complex song.|$|E

40|$|The State of the World‚Äôs Sea Turtles (SWOT) Program {{was created}} in 2003 {{with the goal of}} {{creating}} a dynamic, global-scale, geo-referenced nesting database of all <b>marine</b> <b>turtle</b> species, a network of people who generate and use the data, and a targeted communications and outreach strategy centered around an annual report. The Program is a collaboration of hundreds of individuals and institutions around the world including Oceanic Society, Duke University‚Äôs OBIS-SEAMAP, and the <b>Marine</b> <b>Turtle</b> Specialist Group (MTSG) of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). SWOT has grown to include more than 550 data providers and has published and distributed seven SWOT Reports with award-winning maps on global <b>marine</b> <b>turtle</b> nesting distribution for the seven <b>marine</b> <b>turtle</b> species. This preliminary study highlights the importance of assessing the efficacy of the SWOT Program and its tools in order to determine whether it has been successful in advancing <b>marine</b> <b>turtle</b> research and conservation. Specifically, the study determines if SWOT products are used, how they are used by SWOT members, member expectations, and how the Program can be improved to better contribute to on-the-ground <b>marine</b> <b>turtle</b> research and conservation efforts. The preliminary evaluation presented within this text consists of a web-based survey to gauge knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes toward the SWOT Program. Thirty-three countries were represented from 172 completed surveys. Overall, survey results show that the SWOT Program has been successful in accomplishing its goals through a global network of researchers, a comprehensive database, and various communication strategies. The four most widely-used and well-known SWOT tools are the SWOT Report, maps, database, and website. These are the most well-established SWOT tools. Conversely, the lesser-known tools are those that are less established, such as the Small Grants Program, Outreach Toolkit, Minimum Data Standards, and TurtleVision. Recommendations presented herein, based on survey results, are to expand the SWOT database and network to include foraging/in-water data; establish regional networks in order to facilitate the production of regional tools; increase visibility within the global <b>marine</b> <b>turtle</b> community; expand and improve existing tools such as maps, grants, and accessibility and reliability of data; and hire an individual to manage and foment the SWOT Network...|$|R

25|$|Larger fish, even {{predator}} fish such as {{the great}} barracuda in the photo on the left, often attract a retinue of small fish that accompany them in a strategically safe way. Skindivers who remain for long periods in the water, also often attract a retinue of fish, with smaller fishes coming in close, and larger fishes observing from a greater distance. <b>Marine</b> <b>turtles,</b> functioning as a mobile shelter for small fish, can be impaled accidentally by a swordfish trying to catch the fish.|$|E
25|$|The {{carapace}} of {{the turtle}} has various color patterns that change over time. Hatchlings of Chelonia mydas, {{like those of}} other <b>marine</b> <b>turtles,</b> have mostly black carapaces and light-colored plastrons. Carapaces of juveniles turn dark brown to olive, while those of mature adults are either entirely brown, spotted or marbled with variegated rays. Underneath, the turtle's plastron is hued yellow. C. mydas limbs are dark-colored and lined with yellow, and are usually marked with a large dark brown spot {{in the center of}} each appendage.|$|E
25|$|Mating {{behaviour}} {{is similar}} to other <b>marine</b> <b>turtles.</b> Female turtles control the process. A few populations practice polyandry, although this {{does not seem to}} benefit hatchlings. After mating in the water, the female moves above the beach's high tide line, where she digs a hole 11-22 inches in depth with her hind flippers and deposits her eggs. The hole is then covered up again. Clutch size ranges between 85 and 200, depending on the age of the female. This process takes about an hour to an hour and a half. After the nest is completely covered, she returns to the sea. The female will do this 3 to 5 times in one season.|$|E
