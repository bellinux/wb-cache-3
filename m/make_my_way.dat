25|$|So I {{wrote this}} song that I loved and I {{sent it to}} them and he and Joel, I remember, left me a great message saying, I hate you, you bastard, I love this song. We're gonna have to do it. We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I felt all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and you never did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E
500|$|Film {{historian}} Joseph McBride considered O'Hara's {{performance to}} have been the most powerful and intense emotionally he'd seen since Katharine Hepburn in Mary of Scotland (1936). O'Hara stated that her favorite scene in the film took place outside the church after her character gets married, remarking, [...] "I <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> down the steps to the carriage waiting below, the wind catches my veil and fans it out in a perfect circle all the way around my face. Then it floats straight up above my head and points to the heavens. It's breathtaking." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "At {{the top of}} the {{straight}} I wasn't worried last start, but today I really was," [...] said Bowman. [...] "What she did today was incredible, I mean everything she does is incredible, but I'm lost for words... He (Red Excitement) certainly made a race of it. He left no stone unturned. I was comfortable {{in the first quarter of}} the race but I could see what was happening so I started to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> a bit closer from the 900-metre mark but I still had to stay within myself... I'm concentrating on just keeping her balanced but when she hit the afterburners at the 150-metre mark today, I just can't explain the feeling." ...|$|E
50|$|Blessed is God + who girds me with {{strength}} and <b>makes</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> blameless and strengthens my feet like the harts, at all times, now and always and for ever and ever. Amen.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you are alluding," [...] he replied, [...] "to the {{personal}} remarks I was emboldened to <b>make</b> on <b>my</b> <b>way</b> here, I {{can only say}} that they were excused by their truthfulness." ...|$|R
6000|$|He hesitated. [...] "Then--well--if I {{believed}} in your powers I would still object to your earning money with--by means of your--your Voices. I've got to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> own <b>way</b> in the world, {{and from this}} moment!" ...|$|R
2500|$|The album's opener, [...] "Doll", {{involves}} {{the fear of}} entering into situations unprepared. [...] "Wind Up" [...] was written {{about the relationship between}} musicians and journalists, wherein the latter tend to paint the former as convicted and reluctant. [...] "My Hero" [...] criticizes idolatry and instead extolls friends who are ordinary heroes, which has been considered a statement on fame and partially inspired by former bandmate Kurt Cobain. On the record's closing track, [...] "New Way Home," [...] Grohl longs for his hometown and recalls the drive there on Highway 99. Through this journey, [...] "I realise that it’s OK, I can <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> through all of this, and I’m not that freaked out at the end." [...] Three types of songs permeate the record: ballads, up-tempo tracks and combinations of the two. Grohl felt they were representative of the specific emotions he would feel after the divorce.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am an Englishman--I was {{captured}} by Bandoola, at Ramoo, and sent a prisoner to Ava. I have escaped, and want to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> down to Rangoon; but I heard that orders had been sent along the river to arrest me, and I do not, at present, know how to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> down." ...|$|E
60|$|Tor. I <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way,</b> where'er I see my foe; But you, my lord, {{are good}} at a retreat. I have no Moors behind me.|$|E
60|$|<b>Make</b> <b>way!</b> <b>make</b> <b>way!</b> <b>My</b> lord the Landvogt Is riding {{close at}} hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} heartily, Colonel L'Estrange. I know the village, for I rode through it only {{the day before}} I was captured, and if I can get no guide, I can <b>make</b> <b>my</b> own <b>way</b> round {{as soon as it}} is daylight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You {{have called}} me names enough,' said he, 'I {{will not stand}} it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house {{in the morning and}} <b>make</b> <b>my</b> own <b>way</b> in the world.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was inside}} {{last time it}} surrendered," [...] Terence said, [...] "but I managed to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> out with my regiment, after the explosion." ...|$|E
60|$|So we march {{upstairs and}} make tea {{to fill the}} thermos flask. Then, with sack over my shoulder, I <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> out of the Risveglio.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> {{back across}} the hills and so retrace my steps to Rome. I'll risk my head no more for any lady or any Fool." ...|$|E
60|$|MAUD. [Looking at him curiously] I've {{heard you}} say ever {{so many times that}} no man was any good who couldn't make his own way, father. Well, women are the same as men, now. It's the law of the country. I only want to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> own <b>way.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "That'll be all right. I'll <b>make</b> it in <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to {{help you}} along so you sha'n't be kept in this town a single hour more'n 's necessary." ...|$|R
60|$|No, I did not. But {{a longing}} came upon {{me for the}} old backwoods life, with its freedom and self-reliance, and a hatred for this {{steaming}} country of heat and violent storms, and artificiality and pomp. And I had a desire, even at that age, to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> own <b>way</b> in the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't re'ly k'yer a durn what I DO learn, so's I git {{a chance}} fur to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way.</b> I'd jist as soon learn print'n's anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-night. And--mind--that lout {{gets the}} two horses back again for my {{use in the}} morning. I shall have to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to Chelwood as early as may be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't re'ly k'yer a durn what I do learn, so's I git {{a chance}} fur to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way.</b> I'd jist as soon learn print'n' 's anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I {{have always}} {{intended}} {{to go into}} a profession. I have never looked at it in the same light as you do. I have always intended to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> own <b>way,</b> and have no doubt that I shall do so. I have quite made up my mind about it now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, squire, {{for your}} kind intention," [...] Reuben answered; [...] "but I am {{so much in}} your debt, now, that I would rather not go further into it. I am old enough now to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> own <b>way</b> in life. <b>My</b> only regret in {{the matter is that}} I cannot persuade my mother to go with me." ...|$|R
500|$|While she dislikes being {{referred}} to as [...] "Bono's wife", she has said, [...] " [...] I really don't have a big problem with my own identity, because I am a very private person, so I've always let Bono take the brunt of anything that was coming along. He is happy to do that; I am quite happy to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> own <b>way</b> around things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, citizen, I {{shall have}} to bid you adieu and <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back to Bath. The nags have had the rest they needed and I cannot spend the night here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess that}} puts {{it up to}} Mr. Otter again," [...] said Elsie, ruefully, turning down the street. [...] "And I'm sorry, too, for I'd much rather <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> without help." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{find that}} I cannot by any {{possibility}} get my message {{in through the}} town, sir, I shall try to cross the river and so <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> in on that side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hadn't that duty on my mind, sir; but as Providence has led ye {{to mention}} the subject, I'll <b>make</b> it i' <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to tak ony trifle ye may have to spare; the {{smallest}} contribution will be acceptable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad, indeed, {{that it is}} so," [...] Stanley laughed, [...] "in {{the first}} place, because I could only have succeeded to it at your death; {{and in the second}} place, because I have no ambition, whatever, for a title. I am not {{nineteen}} yet, and should greatly prefer to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> own <b>way,</b> than to find myself with nothing whatever to do, except to spend money as it dropped into my lap.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{told me that}} I {{should have}} to pass through a wood full {{of all sorts of}} enchantments and voices, which would try to frighten me and <b>make</b> me lose <b>my</b> <b>way.</b> Most of those who have gone before me have wandered they know not where, and perished from cold, hunger, or fatigue.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly. I {{have an idea}} {{of going}} up the country across the Zambesi. I've a notion that I should like to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> out somewhere in the Mediterranean,--Egypt, for instance, or Algiers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Au revoir, Mademoiselle," [...] said Nick, [...] "I {{will return}} when I am {{released}} from bondage. When this terrible mentor relaxes vigilance, I will escape and <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> {{back to you}} through the forests." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} to cause alarm. The enemy have not {{discovered}} who I am; but yet would I hide myself here {{with the hope of}} being able to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> through the lines this night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{must stay}} with my aunt," [...] she returned, {{without looking at}} me. And at the same moment, abruptly, without any {{ceremony}} of parting, she quitted me and disappeared, leaving me to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> own <b>way</b> downstairs. I remained a while longer, wandering about the bright desert (the sun was pouring in) of the old house, thinking the situation over on the spot. Not even the pattering little serva came to look after me, and I reflected that after all this treatment showed confidence.|$|R
6000|$|Frank, {{jumping up}} from his chair, threw his arms round his father's neck. [...] "Hate you, sir? How can you speak so cruelly? You know well that I love you. And, father, do not trouble {{yourself}} about the estate for my sake. I do not care for it; I {{can be just as}} happy without it. Let the girls have what is left, and I will <b>make</b> <b>my</b> own <b>way</b> in the world, somehow. I will go to Australia; yes, sir, that will be best. I and Mary will both go. Nobody will care about her birth there. But, father, never say, never think, that I do not love you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, sir,' he said, 'it {{is not my}} custom to open {{my house}} to strangers, but your pinch {{is like to be}} a smart one; for, besides the risk from bad roads, fords, and broken ground, and the night, which looks both black and gloomy, there is bad company on the road sometimes--at least it has a bad name, and some have come to harm; so that I think I must for once <b>make</b> <b>my</b> rule give <b>way</b> to your necessity, and give you a night's lodging in my cottage.|$|R
