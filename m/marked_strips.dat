50|$|The {{first record}} of a people using a {{measuring}} device was by the Romans using <b>marked</b> <b>strips</b> of leather, but this {{was more like a}} regular ruler than a tape measure. On July 14, 1868, a patent was filed by one Alvin J. Fellows of New Haven, Connecticut. Fellows' rule, although crude and flimsy, was the first attempt to make a spring tape measure. On 3 January 1922, Hiram A. Farrand received the patent he filed in 1919 for his spring tape measure. Sometime between 1922 and December 1926, Farrand experimented with the help of The Brown Company in Berlin, New Hampshire. It is there Hiram and William Wentworth Brown began mass-producing the tape measure. Their product was later sold to Stanley Works.|$|E

50|$|Global Positioning System (GPS) {{receivers}} {{show that}} the <b>marking</b> <b>strip</b> for the prime meridian at Greenwich is not exactly at zero degrees, zero minutes, and zero seconds but at approximately 5.3 seconds of arc {{to the west of}} the meridian (meaning that the meridian appears to be 102 metres east of this line). In the past, this offset has been attributed to the establishment of reference meridians for space-based location systems such as WGS 84 (which GPS relies on) or that errors gradually crept into the International Time Bureau timekeeping process. The actual reason for the discrepancy is that the <b>marking</b> <b>strip</b> is indeed at astronomical longitude zero degrees, zero minutes, and zero seconds—but GPS receivers show geodetic longitude (specifically ITRF/WGS 84).|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} and growth {{in size and}} complexity of aerospace Electrical Wiring Interconnection Systems (EWIS) is traced over the last 50 years. The technologies used for <b>marking</b> and <b>stripping</b> of the wire insulation are reviewed {{with reference to the}} issues arising from the continuous process of wire {{development and}} design, and the reduction in wire dimensions and changes in constructions. The latest developments in wire constructions are reviewed along with the state-of-the-art in laser wire <b>marking</b> and <b>stripping</b> technology. These developments are considered in light of recent recommendations from electrical standards groups and from the US Aging Transportation Systems Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ATSRAC). The impact of the recently published Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) Notice of Proposed Rule making (NPRM) on EWIS in relation to wire processing methods for manufacture and maintenance is also reviewed.
