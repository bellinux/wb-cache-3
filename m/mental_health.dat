5|$|Following the {{publication}} of a 2016 interdepartmental report into the issue of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> in the justice system, McEntee stated her belief that it is unacceptable to send people with <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> issues to prison, and that {{this is an issue that}} must be tackled by the government. She also believes the government should address concerns about the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> of unemployed young people.|$|E

5|$|On 2 June, and in {{response}} to a question from Fianna Fáil's James Browne about government spending on <b>mental</b> <b>health,</b> McEntee told the Dáil the government was committed to an annual increase in funding; Browne had noted that in 2014, €20 million had been allocated to <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services rather than the promised €35 million, but McEntee said that €35 million had been ringfenced for 2016 and 2017. Along with Minister for Health Simon Harris, McEntee argued for the restoration of €12 million originally ringfenced for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> spending that had been diverted to other areas. On 8 June, and as part of a €480m bailout package for health, the government announced that the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> funding would be restored. Welcoming the decision, McEntee said the money would be used for staff recruitment and to improve services for homeless people, as well as developing perinatal <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{succeeded in}} its initial aim of {{establishing}} a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care system for Alaska, funded by income from lands allocated to a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> trust. However, during the 1970s and early 1980s, Alaskan politicians systematically stripped the trust of its lands, transferring the most valuable land to private individuals and state agencies. The asset stripping was eventually ruled to be illegal following several years of litigation, and a reconstituted <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> trust {{was established in the}} mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, often {{in combination with}} psychological and social supports. Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> legislation allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s, although it still occurs. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> team, supported employment and support groups are common. Some evidence indicates that regular exercise has {{a positive effect on}} the physical and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> of those with schizophrenia.|$|E

5|$|The reformers were {{especially}} active at the Byberry Hospital in Philadelphia where four Friends initiated The Attendant magazine {{as a way}} to communicate ideas and promote reform. This periodical later became The Psychiatric Aide, a professional journal for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> workers. On May 6, 1946 Life Magazine printed an exposé of the mental healthcare system based on the reports of COs. Another effort of CPS, Mental Hygiene Project became the National <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> Foundation. Initially skeptical about the value of Civilian Public Service, Eleanor Roosevelt, impressed by the changes introduced by COs in the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> system, became a sponsor of the National <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> Foundation and actively inspired other prominent citizens including Owen J.

5|$|<b>Mental</b> <b>health</b> {{consists}} of a broad scope of measurements of mental well being including depression, stress and measurements of self-worth. Numerous factors affect the prevalence of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> disorders among women in India, including older age, low educational attainment, fewer children in the home, lack of paid employment and excessive spousal alcohol use. There is also {{evidence to suggest that}} disadvantages associated with gender increase the risk for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> disorders. Women who find it acceptable for men to use violence against female partners may view themselves as less valuable than men. In turn, this may lead women to seek out fewer avenues of healthcare inhibiting their ability to cope with various mental disorders.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFood {{and housing}} {{insecurity}} {{may contribute to}} poorer <b>mental</b> and physical <b>health.</b> It is unclear as to whether those with prior military service, compared to those without, are more vulnerable to these current stressors. The objective {{of this study was}} to use U. S. population-based data to determine whether prior military service moderates the association of food and housing insecurity with poor <b>mental</b> and physical <b>health.</b> We analyzed data from nine states administering the Social Context module from the 2011 and 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the associations of housing and food insecurity with poor <b>mental</b> and physical <b>health</b> and potential modification by military service. Compared with those with a history of military service, those without had higher prevalence of food insecurity (23. 1 % versus 13. 7 %) and housing insecurity (36. 0 % versus 22. 5 %). Food insecurity was associated with poor <b>mental</b> and physical <b>health</b> (<b>mental</b> health: odds ratio (OR) = 3. 47, 95 % confidence interval (CI) =[3. 18 – 3. 77]; physical health: OR= 3. 21, 95 % CI=[2. 92 – 3. 53]). Similar associations were observed between housing insecurity and poor <b>mental</b> and physical <b>health.</b> Prior military service was significantly associated with poor physical health. Interaction terms of prior military service with food and housing were not statistically significant. Food and housing insecurity does not appear to differentially impact <b>mental</b> and physical <b>health</b> among those with and without military service...|$|R
