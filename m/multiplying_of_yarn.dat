40|$|Many {{applications}} in textile require color measurement of single strands <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> due to unavailability {{of a mass}} <b>of</b> consecutive <b>yarns.</b> While multispectral imaging systems can capture images of single strands <b>of</b> <b>yarns,</b> an unavoidable problem accompanied is how to specify their colors from images, in which pixel values vary with positions owing to three-dimensional shape <b>of</b> <b>yarn.</b> Based on the response of multispectral imaging systems to single strands <b>of</b> <b>yarns,</b> this article formulates the color specification problem as an optimization question and four methods are proposed: average of all pixels (AA), average of pixels in central area (AC), maxima of all pixels (MA), and lightness weighting method (LW). The first experiment analyzed color distribution of pixels on a single strand <b>of</b> <b>yarn.</b> Experimental results show pixels in central area have smallest color variation and largest intensity. The second experiment compared the proposed methods. Results show that CIEXYZ, L*, and C* values specified by the AA and MA methods are lowest and highest.

40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} multispectral {{imaging system}} can directly acquire the reflectance {{of a single}} strand <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> that is impossible for traditional spectrophotometers. Instead, the spectrophotometric reflectance <b>of</b> a <b>yarn</b> winding, which is constituted by yarns wound on a background card, {{is regarded as the}} yarn reflectance in textile. While multispectral imaging systems and spectrophotometers can be separately used to acquire the reflectance of a single strand <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> and corresponding yarn winding, the quantitative relationship between them is not yet known. In this paper, the relationship is established based on models that describe the spectral response of a spectrophotometer to a yarn winding and that of a multispectral imaging system to a single strand <b>of</b> <b>yarn.</b> The reflectance matching function from a single strand <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> to corresponding yarn winding is derived to be a second degree polynomial function, which coefficients are the solutions of a constrained nonlinear optimization problem.
