5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of many coastal nations was increased from 12 to 200 Nmi. The sudden expansion of responsibility dramatically increased the area of ocean requiring surveillance, monitoring and policing by these nations, increasing the strain on existing <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> resources, and highlighting the need for countries without a <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> force to obtain one, especially in the South West Pacific area.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{deployed}} in the North West Pacific for JIMEX 2012 (Japan-India Maritime Exercise) with the four ship group, and took part in India's first bi-lateral maritime exercise with Japan. The Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force (JMSDF) was represented by two destroyers, one <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> aircraft and a helicopter.|$|E
5|$|No.6 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{training}} and bomber squadron. It {{was formed in}} 1917 {{and served as a}} training unit based in England during World War I. The squadron was disbanded in 1919 but re-formed at the start of 1939. It subsequently saw combat as a light bomber and <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> squadron during World War II, and took part in the New Guinea Campaign and New Britain Campaign before being disbanded after the war.|$|E

5|$|While {{the attack}} on Kaafjord was being conducted, the {{commander}} of the German submarines in the Norwegian sea ordered Group Trutz to take up new positions to the south-east of Jan Mayen and intercept the British ships as they returned to Scapa Flow. The Admiralty had anticipated this redeployment, and <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> aircraft from No. 18 Group RAF were directed to sweep the Home Fleet's route back to its base.|$|E
5|$|Although {{late and}} over-budget the {{decision}} to cancel the MRA4 was controversial as the remaining airframes had all been near completion. It {{has been reported that}} following the retirement of the Nimrod MR2 (in March 2010.), Russian submarines have been able to travel past the UK in international waters, but they could not be tracked {{because of the lack of}} suitable aircraft. In November and early December 2014 four <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> aircraft operated by France, Canada and the United States were based at RAF Lossiemouth to attempt to locate a Russian submarine which had been spotted in British territorial waters off west Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Although sales {{never fully}} recovered, the {{improved}} Comet2 and the prototype Comet3 {{culminated in the}} redesigned Comet4 series which debuted in 1958 and had a productive career of over 30years. The Comet was adapted {{for a variety of}} military roles such as VIP, medical and passenger transport, as well as surveillance. The most extensive modification resulted in a specialised <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> aircraft variant, the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod. Nimrod remained in service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) until June 2011, over 60 years after the Comet's first flight.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) each {{maintained}} air {{stations in}} Bermuda {{at the start}} of the war, but these only served flying boats. The RAF station on Darrell's Island served as a staging point for trans-Atlantic flights by RAF Transport Command and RAF Ferry Command, BOAC, and Pan-Am, as well as hosting the Bermuda Flying School, but did not operate <b>maritime</b> <b>patrols.</b> The FAA station on Boaz Island, existed to service aircraft based on vessels operating from or through the Royal Naval Dockyard, but attempted to maintain <b>maritime</b> <b>patrols</b> using pilots from naval ships, RAF Darrell's Island, and the Bermuda Flying School.|$|R
50|$|<b>Maritime</b> <b>patrols</b> can be {{conducted}} by surface ships and submarines, by aircraft (e.g. MPA) and other aerial vehicles, and even by satellites. Human spotting remains {{an important part of}} detecting activity, but increasingly electronic systems are used.|$|R
50|$|September 1939 saw the {{formation}} of 15 Squadron SAAF at Germiston with three former SAA Junkers Ju 86 airliners used for <b>maritime</b> <b>patrols.</b> After moving to Wingfield the squadron was absorbed as A Flight of 32 Squadron SAAF.|$|R
5|$|As a multirole aircraft, the Tornado {{is capable}} of {{undertaking}} more mission profiles than the anticipated strike mission; various operators replaced multiple aircraft types with the Tornado as a common type– the use of dedicated single role aircraft for specialist purposes such as battlefield reconnaissance, <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> duties, or dedicated electronic countermeasures (ECM) were phased out– either by standard Tornados or modified variants, such as the Tornado ECR. The most extensive modification from the base Tornado design was the Tornado ADV, which was stretched and armed with long range anti-aircraft missiles {{to serve in the}} interceptor role.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Australian and New Zealand Governments, at {{the request}} of Pacific Island nations, sent defence representatives into the South-West Pacific region to assess {{surveillance}} and <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> requirements. The governments of a number of the Pacific nations expressed their concern about the need for a suitable naval patrol force to meet their new surveillance requirements. The Australian government responded by creating the Defence Cooperation Project (DCP), to provide suitable patrol vessels, training and infrastructure to island nations in the region. The Pacific Patrol Boat Systems Program Office was created within the Minor War Vessels Branch of the RAN procurement organisation.|$|E
5|$|No. 75 Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) wing that {{operated}} during World WarII. It {{was formed}} in October 1943 at Townsville, Queensland, under North-Eastern Area Command. The wing soon deployed to Horn Island {{to take control of}} RAAF units based there and at Thursday Island and Cape York Peninsula. Responsible for air defence and <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> in the Torres Strait, No.75 Wing's flying units operated P-40 Kittyhawk fighters, Bristol Beaufort reconnaissance bombers, and A-31 Vengeance dive bombers. The wing was disbanded in August 1944.|$|E
5000|$|Law enforcement: Countries with {{extensive}} coastlines {{are vulnerable to}} those entering or exiting the country undetected. In particular smuggling is often carried out over water.

25|$|The JMSDF will lease {{at least}} five TC-90 {{aircraft}} to the Philippines to conduct <b>maritime</b> <b>patrols.</b> From November 2016 to November 2017 six Philippine Navy pilots will be trained to fly the aircraft at Tokushima Airport. Maintenance staff are also being trained.|$|R
5000|$|... 1417 (General Reconnaissance) Flight {{was first}} formed at RAF St. Athan, from No. 417 (General Reconnaissance) Flight RAF, on 1 March 1941, flying Avro Anson I {{aircraft}} on <b>maritime</b> <b>patrols.</b> The flight {{had a very}} short life, being disbanded on 18 March 1941.|$|R
5|$|The BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4 was {{a planned}} <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> and attack {{aircraft}} intended {{to replace the}} Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR2. The rebuilt aircraft would have extended the operating life of the Nimrod fleet by several decades and significantly improved the aircraft by installing more efficient Rolls-Royce BR700 turbofan jet engines to almost double the flight range. The conversion of the flight deck to a digital glass cockpit would have simplified control operations and reduced crew requirements. New detection systems were to be installed, as well as additional weapons for anti-submarine warfare.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF has {{nineteen}} flying squadrons; four combat squadrons, two <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> squadrons, six transport squadrons, six training squadrons (including three Operational Conversion Units and {{a forward}} air control training squadron) {{as well as}} one Airborne Early Warning & Control squadron and a Joint Terminal Attack Controller squadron. The Air Force also includes a single independent flight (No. 5 Flight). The ground units supporting these flying squadrons include three expeditionary combat support squadrons, three security force squadrons and a range of intelligence, air traffic control, communications, radar and medical units.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{was also}} {{responsible}} {{for the protection of}} shipping within the Australia Station. Throughout the war, RAAF aircraft escorted convoys and conducted reconnaissance and anti-submarine patrols from bases around Australia. The main types of aircraft used for <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> were Avro Ansons, Bristol Beauforts, Consolidated PBY Catalinas and Lockheed Hudsons. Following the outbreak of the Pacific War, RAAF fighter squadrons were also stationed to protect key Australian ports and escorted shipping in areas where air attack was feared.|$|E
50|$|Since 2007, the Sri Lanka Air Force {{has been}} {{planning}} to increase its interceptor capability with the acquisition of Mikoyan MiG-29s from Russia.

50|$|The only Fw 58 {{on display}} is at Museu Aeroespacial in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Brazil used this {{airplane}} mainly for <b>maritime</b> <b>patrols</b> and the example on display {{was one of}} the 25 Fw 58B-2 units license-built in Brazil by Fábrica de Galeão, circa 1941.|$|R
5000|$|Economic: Water areas, in {{particular}} {{those close to}} the coast, are areas of economic activity. Not only shipping but also fishing and even tourism are important economic activities to coastal countries. Patrolling these waters falls to <b>maritime</b> <b>patrols.</b> Such patrols may seek fishing vessels which are outside of prescribed fishing grounds (often from neighboring countries' fleets) or which are not adhering to regulations. Additionally, patrols may assist customs agencies by monitoring commercial shipping traffic in controlled waters.|$|R
5|$|No. 20 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) support squadron. Coming {{under the}} control of No. 96 Wing, it is {{responsible}} for the management of the airfield at RAAF Base Woomera, South Australia. The squadron originated as a <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> unit during World War II. Raised in August 1941, it operated PBY Catalina and Short Empire flying boats from bases in New Guinea, Queensland and the Northern Territory, conducting search-and-rescue, mine-laying, anti-submarine and bombing missions against Japanese targets in the Pacific theatre. Following the conclusion of hostilities, the squadron was disbanded in March 1946. It was reactivated as an airfield support squadron in April 2015.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1939 No.4 Squadron, {{which was}} located at RAAF Station Richmond in the {{outskirts}} of Sydney and equipped with Avro Anson patrol aircraft, was redesignated No.6 Squadron. No.4 Squadron had been responsible for conducting reconnaissance patrols along Australia's east coast as well as undertaking training exercises with the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). These duties continued after the squadron was re-designated, and early in 1939 it gained the additional role of providing conversion training on the Anson for new pilots and air gunners. The squadron's <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> activities were hindered by the limitations of its Ansons; these aircraft were obsolete and had an inadequate range and bomb load. On 28 April 1939, an Anson of No. 6 Squadron crashed near Riverstone, killing all four crew members.|$|E
5|$|The ADF was {{subsequently}} {{involved in the}} reconstruction of Iraq. From 2003 until 2005 this was mainly limited to a Security Detachment which protected the Australia embassy, the attachment of officers to multi-national headquarters, small numbers of transport and <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> aircraft, and teams of air traffic controllers and medical personnel. From 2005 until 2008 a battalion-sized Australian Army battle group (initially designated the Al Muthanna Task Group, and later Overwatch Battle Group (West)) was stationed in southern Iraq. In addition, teams of ADF personnel were deployed to train Iraqi military units. In line with a promise made at the 2007 election, the Rudd Government withdrew combat-related forces from Iraq in mid-2008, {{and most of the}} remaining Australian units left the country the next year.|$|E
50|$|NAS Brunswick-based crews flew {{homeland}} defense <b>maritime</b> <b>patrols</b> off the Atlantic coast {{as part of}} Operation Noble Eagle {{and additional}} assets were surged in support of OEF operations.

50|$|The {{squadron}} was reformed at RAF Manston from {{a flight}} of No. 48 Squadron on 15 June 1936, with Avro Ansons {{as part of the}} new RAF Coastal Command. It moved to RAF Bircham Newton on 30 July that year. It initially operated as a training squadron, but later assigned to <b>maritime</b> <b>patrols.</b>|$|R
25|$|It was {{suggested}} that an airport would extend the United Kingdom's capabilities {{to carry out}} airborne missions in the South Atlantic region, such as <b>maritime</b> <b>patrols</b> in accordance with international fishing agreements (e.g., International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas), counter-piracy missions along important trade routes, and also airlift operations notably into Southern Africa.|$|R
5|$|The AW101 is {{equipped}} with the Blue Kestrel search and detection radar which is capable of 360 degree scanning and can detect small targets as far as 25 nautical miles. As part of the Royal Navy's Merlin HM2 upgrade program, Lockheed Martin implemented a series of improvements to the radar, notably allowing it to track 40 {{times the number of}} targets previously capable. Danish EH101s are fitted with the RDR-1600 search and weather radar. Royal Navy Merlins are equipped with the AQS901 anti-submarine system for processing sonographic data from sonobuoys to detect and target submerged submarines. The AQS901 was derived from the system on the earlier Hawker Siddeley Nimrod <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{naval forces}} {{assigned}} to the Australia Station were considerably increased following Japan's entry into {{the war and the}} beginning of the United States military build-up in Australia. These naval forces were supported by a large increase in the RAAF's <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> force and the arrival of United States Navy patrol aircraft. Following the initial Japanese submarine attacks, a convoy system was instituted between Australian ports, and by the end of the war the RAAF and RAN had escorted over 1,100 convoys along the Australian coastline. As the battlefront moved to the north and attacks in Australian waters became less frequent, the number of ships and aircraft assigned to shipping protection duties within the Australia Station was considerably reduced.|$|E
5|$|The only Allied {{military}} forces at Tulagi were 24 commandos from the Australian Army's 2/1st Independent Company, under Captain A. L. Goode, and about 25 personnel from 11 Squadron RAAF, under F/O R. B. Peagam, operating a seaplane base on nearby Gavutu-Tanambogo with four PBY Catalina <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> aircraft. Three Allied coastwatchers were also located nearby, on Guadalcanal island. The {{task of the}} coastwatchers was to report on any enemy movements, or suspicious activity, that they observed {{in the vicinity of}} their stations. In the belief that it might prevent them being executed for espionage, all of the coastwatchers were commissioned as Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve officers, and they were directed by Lieutenant Commander Eric Feldt, who was located at Townsville in Australia.|$|E
