25|$|Little {{is known}} about {{pollination}} in Bifrenaria. Apparently the only existing records report the presence of some large species' pollinia observed {{on the back of}} male Eufriesea violacea bees (Euglossinae), and of Bombus brasiliensis (Bombini). Although there are no reports of flower pollination being directly observed, a paper published in 2006 studied the <b>micromorphology</b> of the labellum in Bifrenaria species, looking for substances useful to insects as food. The absence of such substances on the densely pubescent surface of most Bifrenaria labelli seems to indicate possible pollination by large bees as the major mean. Another indicator of this possibility is the strong smell emanated by species like B. tetragona which {{are similar to those of}} plants in other families which are also pollinated by these bees. The smaller pubescent species may be pollinated by smaller bees, while the smooth ones, which have strong colored flowers, as B. aureofulva, might be pollinated by hummingbirds.|$|E

40|$|In a {{terrestrial}} Triassic–Jurassic boundary {{succession of}} southern Sweden, perfectly zoned sphaerosiderites {{are restricted to}} a specific sandy interval deposited during the end-Triassic event. Underlying and overlying this sand interval {{there are several other}} types of siderite <b>micromorphologies,</b> i. e. poorly zoned sphaerosiderite, spheroidal (ellipsoid) siderite, spherical siderite and rhombohedral siderite. Siderite overgrowths occur mainly as rhombohedral crystals on perfectly zoned sphaerosiderite and as radiating fibrous crystals on spheroidal siderite. Concretionary sparry, microspar and/or micritic siderite cement postdate all of these <b>micromorphologies.</b> The carbon isotope composition of the siderite measured by conventional mass spectrometry shows the characteristic broad span of data, probably as a result of multiple stages of microbial activity. SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry) revealed generally higher δ 13 C values for the concretionary cement than the perfectly zoned sphaerosiderite, spheroidal siderite and their overgrowths, which marks a change in the carbon source during burial. All the various siderite morphologies have almost identical oxygen isotope values reflecting the palaeo-groundwater composition. A pedogenic/freshwater origin is supported by the trace element compositions of varying Fe:Mn ratios and low Mg contents. Fluctuating groundwater is the most likely explanation for uniform repeated siderite zones of varying Fe:Mn ratios reflecting alternating physiochemical conditions and hostility to microbial life/activity. Bacterially mediated siderite precipitation likely incorporated Mn and other metal ions during conditions that are not favourable for the bacteria and continued with Fe-rich siderite precipitation as the physico-chemical conditions changed into optimal conditions again, reflecting the response to groundwater fluctuations...|$|R

40|$|It was {{the goal}} of the present work to {{synthesize}} a series of well-defined pentablock copolymers of styrene (S), [1]dimethylsilaferrocenophane (FS) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) by sequential addition of monomers. Lithium naphthalide was used as difunctional initiator and a 1, 1 -dimethylsilacyclobutane (DMSB) mediated 1, 1 -diphenylethylene (DPE) end-capping technique was applied to ensure high block efficiency. The PMMA-b-PFS-b-PS-b- PFS-b-PMMA systems have molecular weights of Mn = 50, 000 g/mol, polydispersity indices of PDI ≤ 1. 12 and PFS volume fractions of around φ PFS= 0. 15. First, the difunctional middle block of PS was formed, followed by triblock PFS-b-PS-b-PFS, which then - after appropriate end-capping - was employed as a macroinitiator to polymerize MMA, leading to the final pentablock copolymer. The block copolymers were characterized by SEC and NMR. Under optimum reaction conditions - i. e. when chain termination during DPE/DMSB end-capping is minimized - the pentablock copolymer was obtained in approximately 75 % purity: the crude product contained - in addition to the pentablock - some tetrablock (20 %) and triblock (5 %) copolymers. This raw material, however, could be purified by selective precipitation procedures which addressed the differences in polarity of the constituents. By that method, almost quantitative removal of the triblock was possible whereas a small amount of the tetrablock remained in the pentablock fraction. Fortunately the presence of such small amounts of tetrablock copolymers did not influence the pentablock copolymer <b>micromorphologies</b> in an irreproducible way. Thus, profound investigations were possible to analyze the bulk properties of the materials. The pentablock copolymers were examined with the help of TEM and SAXS for their microphase behavior. The self-assembly was studied starting from dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran and toluene solutions, after taking into consideration the solubility parameters. The formation of thermodynamically stable <b>micromorphologies</b> was forced by storing the solvent cast films in the saturated atmosphere of the corresponding solvent for 3 - 4 weeks followed by annealing at elevated temperatures 180 DegC - 220 DegC. Prior to this, it was ensured by TGA and DSC analysis that the pentablock copolymers are of sufficient thermal stability for this treatment. Annealing under various conditions followed by TEM analysis revealed good phase separation and the formation of highly ordered microstructures, such as spheres-on/in-spheres, spheres on lamellar interface, biphasic lamellar, cylinders and spheres on cylinders <b>micromorphologies.</b> These morphologies were further verified and supported by SAXS scattering profiles. Conductivity measurements on original and doped samples (I 2 and TCNE) of PFS containing homo and block copolymers with/without microphase separation were carried out by dielectric spectroscopy (DRS).

By analyzing sediments, archaeologists can gather information regarding site chronology, supplement field descriptions, and test hypotheses related to site formation and function. Laboratories of sediments tend to focus on studying mineralogy, <b>micromorphology,</b> granulometry, pH, organic matter, calcium carbonate, and phosphorus levels. As with any material, specific methods used will depend on questions one is asking of the material. For example, both petrography and x-ray diffraction can be used to examine mineralogy, but the choice of method will depend on the specific minerals one aims to detect.|$|E
50|$|Peter Bullock {{was born}} in Kinlet, Bridgnorth, Shropshire and {{attended}} Bridgnorth Grammar School. Bullock graduated from the University of Birmingham in 1958 with a BA in Geography. After graduating from Birmingham University he joined the Soil Survey of England and Wales (SSEW) as a surveyor, before completing a master's in agricultural chemistry at the University of Leeds. Awarded a Fulbright scholarship, he completed his doctorate at Cornell University and worked for the United States Department of Agriculture, before returning England in 1967. He took the post of head of the mineralogy section of the SSEW where he became a world expert in soil <b>micromorphology.</b> By the 1980s he was head of research, and {{was instrumental in the}} survey's transfer to Cranfield Institute of Technology and its continued existence in face of government threats of withdrawal of funding.|$|E
40|$|Sixty-one {{isolates}} {{and collection}} strains of Aspergillus fumigatus were compared for their phenotypic (morphological features and isoenzyme profiles) and genotypic (restriction enzyme-generated mitochondrial DNA and ribosomal DNA profiles and random amplified polymorphic DNA patterns) features. The examined strains exhibited highly variable colony morphologies and growth rates at different temperatures, but their <b>micromorphologies</b> and conidial diameters were {{characteristic of the}} species. Of the isoenzymes studied, the beta-arylesterase and phosphatase patterns were the most divergent, and the 61 strains could be classified into seven groups. The glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and catalase isoenzyme patterns displayed only a limited variability, while the profiles of superoxide dismutase, lactate dehydrogenase, and glutamate dehydrogenase were highly conserved. The HaeIII-generated mitochondrial DNA patterns and SmaI-digested repetitive DNA and ribosomal DNA hybridization patterns of almost all strains were also invariable. The level of variation was much higher when random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis was applied. Although the patterns of the strains were very similar {{with most of the}} primers, the application of some primers made it possible to cluster the A. fumigatus isolates into several groups. The results indicate that the random amplified polymorphic DNA technique could be used more efficiently than isoenzyme analysis for typing A. fumigatus isolates. A good correlation was found between the dendrograms obtained from the isoenzyme and random amplified polymorphic DNA data, but the isoenzyme and amplified DNA patterns did not correlate with the pathogenicity, pigment production, or geographical origin of the strains.

40|$|Caves {{formed by}} rising sulfuric waters have been {{described}} {{from all over the}} world in a wide variety of climate settings, from arid regions to mid-latitude and alpine areas. H 2 S is generally formed at depth by reduction of sulfates in the presence of hydrocarbons and is transported in solution through the deep aquifers. In tectonically disturbed areas major fractures eventually allow these H 2 S-bearing fluids to rise to the surface where oxidation processes can become active producing sulfuric acid. This extremely strong acid reacts with the carbonate bedrock creating caves, some of which are among the largest and most spectacular in the world. Production of sulfuric acid mostly occurs at or close to the water table but also in subaerial conditions in moisture films and droplets in the cave environment. These caves are generated at or immediately above the water table, where condensation-corrosion processes are dominant, creating a set of characteristic meso- and <b>micromorphologies.</b> Due to their close connection to the base level, these caves can also precisely record past hydrological and geomorphological settings. Certain authigenic cave minerals, produced during the sulfuric acid speleogenesis (SAS) phase, allow determination of the exact timing of speleogenesis. This paper deals with the morphological, geochemical and mineralogical description of four very typical sulfuric acid water table caves in Europe: the Grotte du Chat in the southern French Alps, the Acqua Fitusa Cave in Sicily (Italy), and the Bad Deutsch Altenburg and Kraushohle caves in Austria...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years the {{research}} concerning marine microorganisms has increased in number. However, the knowledge about the phylogenetic and diversity of this fungal community is still scarce. The reliable identification of filamentous fungi typically implies the analyses {{of a variety of}} morphological, biochemical and molecular traits. Recently, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Time-Of-Flight Intact Cell Mass Spectrometry (MALDl-TOF ICMS) has been used to generate spectra of protein masses in a range from 2000 to 20000 Da that are a taxa specific fingerprinting. This technique has already shown high potentialities to discriminate very dosely related taxa and, it {{has been used as a}} new tool in the polyphasic approach to identify this kind of microorganisms. The aim of the present study was investigate the diversity of 19 penicillia isolated from the southern Atlantic Ocean marine sponge Dragmacidon reticulate using a polyphasic approach. The first approach was the sequence of ITS-rDNA gene region and to compare with sequence data available at NCBl-GenBank using BLAST N· The putative penicillia species were further investigated using the phenotypic techniques: macro- and <b>micromorphologies</b> and MALDl-TOF ICMS. From 19 isolates 9 ribotypes were obtained from the sequencing analysis. One ribotype after phenotypic analysis is a clearly new species and the remain ribotypes have their identification confirmed by micro- and macro-morphological and MALDl-TOF ICMS analyses. In conclusions, the MALDl-TOF ICMS is a sound technique for fungal identification and the new species is now under study to be formally described...|$|R
