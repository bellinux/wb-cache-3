500|$|In early September, {{another letter}} from Parker arrived saying that Stockel wished {{to provide the}} copyist's fee for writing out the orchestral parts in Finland. As 1913 drew to a close, Sibelius had not made much {{progress}} on the American commission, having spent the entire autumn on other pieces and revisions. A trip to Berlin in January 1914 followed, and Sibelius's diary and correspondence indicate the Stoeckel commission was {{at the forefront of}} his mind; an initial plan to set Rydberg's poem Fantasos and Sulamit subsequently was discarded. His stay in Berlin was not productive, and in mid-February he returned to Helsinki ("Uneasy because of the America thing [...] Presumably have to go home to <b>my</b> <b>cell</b> {{in order to be able}} to concentrate".) ...|$|E
500|$|Brown's {{trial began}} in Naha on May 26 with {{testimony}} from V. N.. Over {{the next three}} days of testimony, V. N. repeatedly stated that Brown was innocent and that she wanted to withdraw her complaint. She said that any contact between her and Brown on the night in question was consensual and that she allowed Brown to fondle and kiss her breasts. At that point, V. N. said, she began to resist and Brown became angry. V. N. testified that when she threatened to call police, Brown threw her cell phone into the [...] river. Angry at the loss of her cell phone, V. N. stated that she then embellished the story when she told it to the guards at the Courtney main gate. V. N. further claimed that she had been coerced by police, prosecutors and her employer, a local agency that provides temporary workers for USMC bases on Okinawa, to file the charges. She said that once the charges were filed, Japanese prosecutors told her she could only withdraw the charges in court. One of the Naha judges then asked V. N. why she was not angry at Brown to which V. N. replied, [...] "Because he didn't attempt to rape me. Before, I was angry at him for throwing away <b>my</b> <b>cell</b> phone. But not now." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{imprisoned in}} Yemen, Anwar al-Awlaki became {{influenced}} by the works of Qutb.

So they have learnt to do with my body. They invert, transpose, alter, permute, create cells never seen before and with no sense, or with a sense which is contrary to the right sense. There must be a right sense, and wrong senses, otherwise one dies. ...|$|R

2500|$|While {{imprisoned in}} Yemen after 2004, al-Awlaki was {{influenced}} by the works of Sayyid Qutb, described by the New York Times as an originator of the contemporary [...] "anti-Western Jihadist movement".

2500|$|... "In {{spite of}} everything, {{it was a}} very fertile period for me. During the first weeks, I had a dream almost every night, some of which {{anticipated}} my future work. In <b>my</b> <b>cell</b> I was surrounded by a profound silence. I could work on myself and that is when I began to write a novel. My neighbors simply waited for each day to pass. That time of captivity was precious to me because I could exercise zazen meditation and remain in immobility for hours." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the light}} of this, Greco was quickly rearrested in February 1992 and put back behind bars to serve his freshly {{reinstated}} life-sentence. Greco never admitted his crimes nor his position in Cosa Nostra. In a letter sent to the press {{in the summer of}} 2007, he claimed he was [...] "as innocent as a newborn child." [...] He added that [...] "because of an injustice in the 1980s I have been buried alive and have been in prison for 22 years. The dampness of <b>my</b> <b>cell</b> has destroyed my health and I am truly in a bad way." [...] He remained in prison in Rome until his death on 13 February 2008.|$|E

40|$|The {{arrival of}} {{synthetic}} organs may mean {{we need to}} reconsider principles of ownership of such items. One possible ownership criterion is {{the boundary between the}} organ’s being outside or inside the body. What is outside of my body, even if it is a natural organ made of <b>my</b> <b>cells,</b> may belong to a company or research institution. Yet when it is placed in me, it belongs to me. In the future, we should also keep an eye on how the availability of synthetic organs may change our attitudes toward our own bodies...|$|R
2500|$|On 18 April, Marwan Barghouti, a Fatah {{leader in}} prison in Israel called on Johnston's kidnappers to free the {{journalist}} [...] "from <b>my</b> <b>cell,</b> and {{in the name of}} 10,000 prisoners in the occupation jails". Aidan White, general secretary of the International Federation of Journalists, announced that he would visit Gaza to deliver a letter to the Palestinian Authority, signed by 200 European MPs, which asked the PA to [...] "make every effort" [...] to ensure Johnston was freed. The 200 MEPs also called on the European Union to take stronger action. The European Parliament would later unanimously support a resolution on 25 April urging the immediate release of Johnston, with the resolution's proposer saying it sent [...] "a strong political signal" [...] for his release.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{successful}} {{action by the}} Conservative Party (UK) government the high court announced in July 2017 that the judicial review would be held in private and that evidence relating to the defence {{by the government and}} security services would neither be made available to Belhaj or his legal team nor made public. Criticising the decision Belhaj was quoted as saying that [...] "I went through a secret trial once before, in Gaddafi’s Libya. It took about a half hour, and I never saw any of the evidence against me. Later a guard came to <b>my</b> <b>cell</b> and tossed in a red jumpsuit – that was how I found out that the secret court had sentenced me to die" [...] and continued [...] "what kind of a trial will it be if we put in a mountain of evidence and government officials can simply refuse to answer us". In response, Straw stated that he was opposed to extraordinary rendition and had not been complicit in it.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2014, Kahn {{recalled}} [...] "Janet Jackson {{has a very}} charming way {{of going}} through her editorial process – she always goes [...] "if you think it works," [...] and she means it. That's awesome, she's freaking Janet Jackson." [...] Jackson contacted Kahn directly to direct the video, saying [...] "I was star struck on Janet for sure, {{because that was the}} first time that I really dealt with someone that was in my youth. I studied Janet Jackson videos growing up. So to finally see myself face to face with her and working with her and her calling me on a first name basis and calling my home and tracking me down on <b>my</b> <b>cell</b> phone… like her leaving messages, it was the weirdest thing." [...] Kahn continued [...] "And Janet, she really is elegant, she’s like royalty. Even though she’s talking to you and trying to be normal, she’s not – she’s Janet Jackson – and you can never get that out of your head. You realize that she’s a real person and she’s got just the same emotions as everyone else, but you can never get around the fact that she’s special." ...|$|E

Of course, it's illegal to discriminate, 'genoism' it's called. But no one takes the law seriously. If you refuse to disclose, they can always take a sample from a door handle or a handshake, even the saliva on your application form. If in doubt, a legal drug testcan just as easily become an illegal peek at your future in the company. Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) ...|$|R

40|$|Extract] My {{period was}} only about 10 days overdue, but I had already {{experienced}} a flash of intuitive knowing – one of those millisecond moments whose power leaves you with utter conviction. I lay on the golden sand of the Algarve, dozing in the warm spring sun. Enjoying Portugal away from the cold northern European winter. It was a still day with barely a breeze, the water like glass. The knowing rushed up from inside <b>my</b> <b>cells</b> {{at the speed of}} light, bursting into my consciousness – I'm pregnant! I sat up, startled. Had I dreamt it? I did not dare to really believe. It was too much to absorb all at once, too awesome...|$|R

60|$|It {{was merely}} after {{unconsciousness}} {{had come to}} me that I found myself in his <b>cell.</b> <b>My</b> body, I knew, lay in the jacket back in <b>my</b> own <b>cell.</b> Although never before had I seen him, I knew {{that this man was}} Jake Oppenheimer. It was summer weather, and he lay without clothes on top his blanket. I was shocked by his cadaverous face and skeleton-like body. He was not even the shell of a man. He was merely the structure of a man, the bones of a man, still cohering, stripped practically of all flesh and covered with a parchment-like skin.|$|R

I pasted my ear close to the radio, figuring out the singer's breaths. I imitated her. The aria was called 'I won't quit the battle until all the beasts are killed.' It was sung by Iron Plum a teenage character in an opera called The Red Lantern. I would not stop singing the aria until my vocal cords hurt. I went on pushing my voice to its highest pitch.

5000|$|Cronenberg {{has stated}} that {{the genesis of the}} film was a viral {{infection}} he once had. More precisely, the [...] "central idea came to him in a fever dream during a bout of illness," [...] wrote journalist Jill Lawless. Cronenberg said, [...] "I was delirious and was obsessing over the physicality of illness, {{the fact that there was}} something in my body and in <b>my</b> <b>cells</b> that had come from someone else's body, and I started to think there was a weird intimacy to that connection. And afterwards I tried to think of a character who would see a disease that way and I thought: a celebrity-obsessed fan. Celebrity culture is completely bodily obsessed - who has the most cellulite, who has fungus feet? Celebrity culture completely fetishizes the body and so I thought the film should also fetishize the body - in a very grotesque way." ...|$|R
