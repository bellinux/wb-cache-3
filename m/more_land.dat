5|$|A variant on {{this design}} {{is the use}} of arrays, whose tilt angle can be {{adjusted}} twice or four times annually to optimise seasonal output. They also require <b>more</b> <b>land</b> area to reduce internal shading at the steeper winter tilt angle. Because the increased output is typically only a few percent, it seldom justifies the increased cost and complexity of this design.|$|E

5000|$|Some of Svetlana’s {{answers from}} this {{interview}} became popular memes of Russian Internet. For example, when {{prompted by the}} reporter {{to name a few}} major accomplishments of United Russia, she used phrases which could be translated into English as [...] "we began to dress more betterer" [...] and [...] "There were <b>more...</b> <b>lands...</b> I don't even know how to put it... seeding <b>more</b> <b>lands...</b> Yeah. Vegetables, rye, all that stuff". The interview led some to speculate that Svetlana was using some kind of Newspeak to communicate her thoughts.|$|R
5|$|In some countries, {{the need}} for <b>more</b> <b>land</b> for housing is {{threatening}} small airfields. These airfields may {{also be used for}} other general aviation activities, and the addition of gliding may be difficult to accommodate. This can limit the number of available airfields and so it can require longer drives to reach them.|$|E
5|$|After Mission San Fernando Rey de España was {{established}} in 1797, the administrators there realized they would need <b>more</b> <b>land</b> for agriculture and livestock, and they looked north to the Santa Clarita Valley to establish their estancia, or mission rancho. Subsequently, the Tataviam who had been living there were relocated to the Mission, where they were baptized and put to work. The Estancia de San Francisco Xavier was built in 1804 at the confluence of Castaic Creek and the Santa Clara River.|$|E
5|$|After being {{appointed}} {{governor of}} the newly formed Indiana Territory in 1800, William Henry Harrison sought to secure title to Native American lands to open <b>more</b> <b>land</b> for settlers; in particular, he hoped the Indiana Territory would attract enough settlers to qualify for statehood. Harrison negotiated numerous land cession treaties with American Indians, including the Treaty of Fort Wayne on September 30, 1809, in which Miami, Pottawatomie, Lenape, and other tribal leaders sold 3,000,000acres (approximately 12,000km²) to the United States.|$|E

5|$|After the Rove sediments were deposited, the Penokean orogeny added <b>more</b> <b>land</b> mass by {{accretion}} {{that occurred}} from the south. A few {{hundred million years}} later the proto-North American continent nearly split in half along the Midcontinent Rift zone, which is a bow-shaped rift extending from northeast Kansas, arcing through the present-day Lake Superior Basin and then angling southeast through Michigan. Then came a period of advancing and retreating glaciers. The more resistant diabase sills and dikes remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers. The north path of glaciation is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} and the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century. The Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 {{was intended to}} make it easier for landlords to enclose and improve common land, introduce increased efficiency, bring <b>more</b> <b>land</b> under the plough, and reduce the high prices of agricultural production. Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On the industrial front, mining developed as a major source of employment, especially at Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E
5|$|As {{the colonists}} fenced off <b>more</b> <b>land,</b> the Noongar were {{increasingly}} {{denied access to}} their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites. In search of food, the Noongar raided the settlers' crops and killed their cattle. They also developed a taste for the settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony. In addition, the Noongar practice of firestick farming: firing the bush to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' crops and houses.|$|E

5|$|During the Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1802, {{the delegates}} {{allegedly}} received reports from a fur trapper that Lake Michigan extended significantly farther south than {{had previously been}} believed (or mapped). Thus, {{it was possible that}} an east–west line extending east from Lake Michigan's southern tip might intersect Lake Erie somewhere east of Maumee Bay, or worse, might not intersect the lake at all; the farther south that Lake Michigan actually extended, the <b>more</b> <b>land</b> Ohio would lose, perhaps even the entire Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, {{independent}} Vermont continued to experience rapid population growth, and Allen sold {{a great deal}} of his land, but also reinvested much the proceeds in <b>more</b> <b>land.</b> A lack of cash, complicated by Vermont's currency problems, placed a strain on Fanny's relatively free hand on spending, which was further exacerbated by the cost of publishing Reason, and of {{the construction of a new}} home near the mouth of the Onion River. He was threatened with debtors' prison on at least one occasion, and was at times reduced to borrowing money and calling in old debts to make ends meet.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} at a general meeting on 22 March 1895 that the club could finally {{afford to buy}} Goodison Park. Mahon revealed that Everton were buying Goodison Park for £650 less than the price of Anfield three years earlier, with Goodison Park having <b>more</b> <b>land</b> and a 25% larger capacity. The motion to purchase Goodison Park was passed unanimously. Dr. Baxter also lent the club £5,000 to redeem the mortgage early {{at a rate of}} 3½%. By this time the redrawing of political boundaries put Walton, and hence Goodison Park, inside the City of Liverpool.|$|E

5|$|Open country species, which {{comprise}} {{the majority of}} bee-eaters, have mostly expanded in range as <b>more</b> <b>land</b> is converted to agriculture, but some tropical forest species have suffered declines through loss of habitat, although no species or subspecies gives serious cause for concern. There is some human persecution of bee-eaters, with nest holes being blocked, adults shot or limed, or young taken for food. More generally problematic is the unintended destruction of nests. This can occur through cattle trampling, as with the blue-headed bee-eater in Kenya, or loss of forests, with massive conversion of native forest to oil palm plantations in Malaysia being particularly concerning.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the war stems from the {{increasing}} numbers of English colonists and their demand for land. As <b>more</b> <b>land</b> was purchased from the Native Americans, they were restricted to smaller territories for themselves. Native American leaders such as King Philip resented the loss of land and looked for a means to slow or reverse it. Of specific concern was {{the founding of the}} town of Swansea, which was located only {{a few miles from the}} Wampanoag capital at Mount Hope. The General Court of Plymouth began using military force to coerce the sale of Wampanoag land to the settlers of the town.|$|E
5|$|The {{human and}} {{environmental}} {{costs of the}} Gold Rush were substantial. Native Americans, dependent on traditional hunting, gathering and agriculture, became the victims of starvation and disease, as gravel, silt and toxic chemicals from prospecting operations killed fish and destroyed habitats. The surge in the mining population also resulted in the disappearance of game and food gathering locales as gold camps and other settlements were built amidst them. Later farming spread to supply the settlers' camps, taking <b>more</b> <b>land</b> away from the Native Americans.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Queen's Park {{requested}} <b>more</b> <b>land</b> {{for development of}} the second Hampden Park. This was refused by the landlords, {{which led to the}} club seeking a new site. Henry Erskine Gordon agreed to sell 12 acres of land off Somerville Drive to Queen's Park in November 1899. James Miller designed twin grandstands along {{the south side of the}} ground with a pavilion wedged in between. The natural slopes were shaped to form banks of terracing, designed by Archibald Leitch. Construction of the new ground took over three years to complete; during construction, a disaster occurred at Ibrox in which part of the wooden terraces collapsed. In response, the terraces at Hampden were firmly set in the earthwork and innovative techniques were used to control spectators.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{examination}} for {{the construction}} of what would become Penticton Regional Airport began in 1937, at two locations. The proposed areas—west of Penticton's city centre and north of the Skaha Lake—were owned by the Penticton Indian Band. The land for the airport was expropriated from the band in 1949 under the War Measures Act, with the preliminary development of the airfield completed in 1941. Because of wartime military air transportation concerns, the airport acted as an emergency landing strip until its tarmac was completed. Rights for a temporary public use airport were secured in 1945for an operation of 24hours a day. In 1946, <b>more</b> <b>land</b> was acquired from the Penticton Indian Band for the airport's use.|$|E
5|$|Paintings of {{the canyon}} by Frederick S. Dellenbaugh were {{exhibited}} at the Saint Louis World's Fair in 1904, followed by a glowing article in Scribner's Magazine the next year. That, along with previously created photographs, paintings, and reports, led to President William Howard Taft's proclamation on July 31, 1909 that created Mukuntuweap National Monument. In 1917, the {{acting director of the}} newly created National Park Service visited the canyon and proposed changing its name from the locally unpopular Mukuntuweap to Zion, a name used by the local Mormon community. The United States Congress added <b>more</b> <b>land</b> and established Zion National Park on November 19, 1919. A separate Zion National Monument, the Kolob Canyons area, was proclaimed on January 22, 1937, and was incorporated into the park on July 11, 1956.|$|E
