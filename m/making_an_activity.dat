30|$|According to Lieberoth (2015), {{it might}} not be the game itself that stimulates individuals, but rather the packaging: the fact that an {{activity}} resembles a game. The simple framing of an activity as a “game” can potentially alter an individual’s behavior. To demonstrate this insight Lieberoth designed an experiment focusing on the psychological effects of framing tasks as games versus including game mechanics. The outcomes indicate that engagement and enjoyment increased significantly due to the psychological effects of framing the task as a game. Furthermore, no actual increased interest or enjoyment was measured by adding actual game mechanics to the task, when it was already framed as a game. This study reveals an interesting psychological perspective of gamification in educational environments: merely <b>making</b> <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> seem like a game impacts learners’ engagement.|$|E
