500|$|Much of Connor's {{development}} in season {{three and four}} is his continuous shifting alliances between protagonists and antagonists; {{he is unable to}} find his place or his purpose for being. Jeffrey Bell says that all the confusing and conflicting circumstances never allow Connor a break, which he thinks [...] "makes him empathetic in midst of making all wrong choices". Steven S. DeKnight says: [...] We really wanted to highlight [...] that he is a tragic victim of circumstance.

2500|$|Doughty advocates reappropriating pejoratives like 'morbid', and [...] {{wants to}} reverse the {{attitude}} that [...] "talking about death is deviant". She says, [...] "Death is not deviant, it's actually the most normal and universal act there is." [...] She is working to overcome the belief that dead bodies are dangerous and can only be handled by trained professionals using technical equipment and specialized facilities. She says {{the most important thing}} she wants the public to know is that the corpse is the family's legal quasi-property, and that you have the power over what happens to that body. Don't let anyone, funeral home, hospital, coroner, etc., pressure you into making a quick decision you might regret. Take the time to do your research and understand your options. The dead person will still be dead in 24 hours; you have time to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decision</b> for you. While a body is not commercial property, which can be transferred or held for a debt, for purposes of burial the body is treated as the next of kin's property.
