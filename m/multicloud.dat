40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{is a type}} {{of computing}} that relies on sharing computing resources rather than having local servers or personal devices to handle applications. In cloud computing, the word cloud is used {{as a metaphor for the}} Internet, so the phrase [...] are delivered to an organization's computers cloudcomputing means "a type of Internet-based computing," where different services [...] such as servers, storage and applications and devices through the Internet. Presently implementation of cloud computing has increased rapidly in IT industry and in other organization also. Cloud is a collection of distributed database. It provides number of benefit such that low cost and accessibility of data. If a data is store only at single place and unfortunately that data has been lost then there is no recovery of data. Cloud computing gives us a solution to store a number of copy of data, in this manner if a data is going to be loss at one place that can be retrieved from other place. The problem of service unavailability has been solved by using cloud computing, which was a major concern in single cloud. In recently days use of multi cloud becoming popular because its provide the major benefit of service availability. As much of benefit coming with multi- cloud computing, that much security issues also coming with it. A cloud user is storing their information in clouds, those cloud provider can be untrusted, the information stored by user can be sensitive and in cloud there may be a chances of availability of malicious and anomaly which can harm user sensitive data. So security of data in multi-cloud computing is a major concern. In this paper we are going to discuss about functionality of single and multi cloud computing and security threats.

40|$|Simple {{models for}} the diurnal cycle and convectively coupled waves Received: date / Accepted: date Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{a study of the}} diurnal cycle of tropical precipitation and its interaction with convectively coupled waves in the context of simple models with crude vertical resolution. One and two baroclinic mode models are tested in both the context of a one-column model and the context of full spatial dependency that permits waves to propagate and interact with the diurnal cycle. It is found that a one baroclinic mode model is capable of reproducing a realistic diurnal cycle of tropical precipitation both over land and over the ocean provided an adequate switch function is used to mimic the congestus preconditioning mechanism that operates in the <b>multicloud</b> model of Khouider and Majda. However, a full two baroclinic mode <b>multicloud</b> model is needed to capture the interaction of convectively coupled tropical waves with the diurnal cycle.

Here a new systematic version of the <b>multicloud</b> models is developed with separate upper- and lower-troposphere basis functions for the congestus and stratiform clouds. It naturally leads to a new convective closure for the <b>multicloud</b> models enhancing the congestus heating {{in order to better}} pinpoint the congestus preconditioning and moistening mechanisms. The models are studied here for flows above the equator without rotation effects. First, the new model results consist of the usual synoptic-scale convectively coupled moist gravity wave packets moving at 15 – 20 m s 1 but, in addition, these packets have planetary-scale envelopes moving in the opposite direction at about 6 m s 1 and have many of the self-similar features of convectively coupled waves, reminiscent of the Madden–Julian oscillation. Second, when a warm pool forcing is imposed, dry regions of roughly 250 km in extent form “convective barriers” surrounding the warm pool region where only congestus heating survives. Deep convection and moist gravity waves are thus confined within the warm pool region. Finally, linear analysis reveals that, for sufficiently dry mean states, in addition to the inherent synoptic-scale moist gravity waves, the new model supports a planetary (wavenumber 1) standing congestus mode that provides, within its congestus active phase, a region where moist gravity waves evolve and propagate, which results in a Walker-like circulation over a uniform SST background. 1...|$|E
30|$|In the era {{of cloud}} computing, the trend which {{enterprises}} choose to deploy their software on hybrid and <b>multicloud</b> is indispensable. The flexible choice among cloud providers helps enterprises to save the cost due to which they can select the best services to install different software parts. This leads to demands of service migration and replication across the clouds. Our proposed framework supports service migration/replication mechanism to fulfill the need at component level. It allows deployers to describe software using a hierarchical DSL, deploy it using an implementation of a <b>multicloud</b> distributed deployment framework, and provide autonomic rules to respond to fluctuations of environment, thereby ensuring availability and scalability. In our framework, we also address the optimal deployment problem of components replicated by the DM. While the cost of copying the whole virtual machines is too high due to their big virtualization overhead, the fine-grained service replication/migration at component level is a possible solution. The experiments were conducted to prove the advantage of our partial approach in comparison to full migration and replication of an entire server stack. The numerical results also provide a suggestion of improving the system performance for a cloud provider.|$|E

Second, we complement our framework with the optimal deployment problem of replicated components. More specifically, we tackle the online optimization problem of component placement on <b>multicloud</b> regarding to the communication cost under constraints on system resources and a hierarchical structure of component-based applications. We formulate the placement problem as a quadratic program. Third, we validate our proposed mechanism by an experiment conducted in the context of an elastic scenario, and provide useful insights for cloud providers to decide if they should add servers or upgrade server connections to improve the average responsive time of the system.|$|E

A systematic model convective pa-rameterization highlighting the dynamic role of the three cloud types is developed here through two baroclinic modes of vertical structure: a deep convective heating mode and a second mode with low-level heating and cooling corresponding respectively to congestus and stratiform clouds. A systematic moisture equation is developed where the lower troposphere moisture increases through detrainment of shallow cumulus clouds, evaporation of stratiform rain, and moisture convergence and decreases through deep convective precipitation. A nonlinear switch is developed that favors either deep or congestus convection depending on the relative dryness of the troposphere; in particular, a dry troposphere with large convective available potential energy (CAPE) has no deep convection and only congestus clouds. The properties of the <b>multicloud</b> model parameterization are tested by linearized analysis in a two-dimensional setup with no rotation with constant sea surface temperature.

40|$|The {{representation}} of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) is still a challenge for numerical weather prediction and general circulationmodels (GCMs) because of the inadequate treatment of convection and the associated interactions across scales by the underlying cumulus parameterizations. One new promising di-rection {{is the use of}} the stochastic <b>multicloud</b> model (SMCM) that has been designed specifically to capture themissing variability due to unresolved processes of convection and their impact on the large-scale flow. The SMCM specifically models the area fractions of the three cloud types (congestus, deep, and stratiform) that characterize organized convective systems on all scales. The SMCM captures the stochastic behavior of these three cloud types via a judiciously constructed Markov birth–death process using a particle interacting lattice model. The SMCM has been successfully applied for convectively coupled waves in a simplified primitive equationmodel and validated against radar data of tropical precipitation.
