40|$|Structureborne {{noise is}} {{discussed}} {{as a contributor}} to propeller aircraft interior noise levels that are nonresponsive to {{the application of a}} generous amount of cabin sidewall acoustic treatment. High structureborne noise levels may jeopardize passenger acceptance of the fuel-efficient high-speed propeller transport aircraft designed for cruise at Mach 0. 65 to 0. 85. These single-rotation tractor and counter-rotation tractor and pusher propulsion systems will consume 15 to 30 percent less fuel than advanced turbofan systems. Structureborne noise detection methodologies and the importance of development of a structureborne noise sensor are discussed. A structureborne noise generation mechanism is described in which the periodic components or propeller swirl produce periodic torques and forces on downstream wings and airfoils that are propagated to the cabin interior as noise. Three concepts for controlling structureborne noise are presented: (1) a stator row swirl remover, (2) selection of a proper combination of blade numbers in the rotor/stator system of a single-rotation propeller, and the rotor/rotor system of a counter-rotation propeller, and (3) a tuned <b>mechanical</b> <b>absorber...</b>|$|E

Consequently, they become increasingly nonlinear and they {{are more prone to}} undergo aeroelastic limit cycle oscillations. Structural nonlinearities affect aircraft such as the F- 16, which can undergo store-induced limit cycle oscillations (LCOs). Furthermore, transonic buzz can lead to LCOs because of moving shock waves in transonic flight conditions on many aircraft. This study presents a numerical investigation of passive LCO suppression on a typical aeroelastic system with pitch and plunge degrees of freedom and a hardening stiffness nonlinearity. The absorber used is made of a piezoelectric patch glued to the plunge springs and connected to a resistor and an inductance forming a RLC circuit. A mechanical tuned mass damper absorber of similar configuration is also considered. The piezoelectric absorber features significant advantages in terms of size, weight and tuning convenience. The results show that both types of absorber increase the linear flutter speed of the system in a similar fashion but, when optimal, they lead to a sub-critical bifurcation while a super-critical bifurcation was observed without absorber. Finally, it is shown that the addition of a properly tuned nonlinear spring (<b>mechanical</b> <b>absorber)</b> or capacitor (piezo- electric absorber) can restore the super-criticality of the bifurcation.

40|$|Many of <b>mechanical</b> energy <b>absorbers</b> {{utilized}} in engineering structures are hydraulic dampers, {{since they are}} simple and highly efficient and have favourable volume to load capacity ratio. However, there exist fields of applications where a threat of toxic contamination with the hydraulic fluid contents must be avoided, for example, food or pharmacy industries. A solution here can be a Pneumatic Adaptive Absorber (PAA), which {{is characterized by a}} high dissipation efficiency and an inactive medium. In order to properly analyse the characteristics of a PAA, an adequate mathematical model is required. This paper proposes a concept for mathematical modelling of a PAA with experimental verification. The PAA is considered as a piston-cylinder device with a controllable valve incorporated inside the piston. The objective {{of this paper is to}} describe a thermodynamic model of a double chamber cylinder with gas migration between the inner volumes of the device.

40|$|Bending {{vibration}} {{of flexible}} structures can be suppressed passively using piezoelectric electromechanical transducers and optimally tuned LR circuits. Since these systems include both mechanical and electrical elements, the governing equations consist of electrically coupled equations of motion. This paper describes a new method for deriving the governing equations that describe a system’s vibration suppression {{based on the}} equilibrium of force principle and using an equivalent mechanical model of a piezoelectric element. Both series and parallel LR circuits are considered in the modeling approach.

40|$|During {{the last}} years the {{interest}} in energy harvesting has increased steadily due {{to the need to}} power wireless sensors for condition monitoring. Different techniques have already been studied for this purpose and the use of <b>mechanical</b> vibration <b>absorbers</b> as resonators offers the attractive possibility to integrate condition monitoring and vibration reduction into a single device. In this context, transversal vibrations have been the matter of other works. However, this study restricts its attention to rotational vibrations which introduces a significant difference compared to the previous. Indeed, rotation is a widely used form of power transmission and mechanical motion commonly used in various applications. Therefore, although the study of rotational vibration absorbers is of great importance, the harvesting of energy in these conditions is even more challenging. In this study a framework for a rotational vibration absorber is presented and an analytical model to ex plain its operation is derived. A feasibility study of an energy harvesting integrated with the rotational vibration absorber is conducted and applied to the specific rotational system of a drive-train.

Medications used to decrease involuntary antagonistic muscles contraction can threaten their life. However, <b>mechanical</b> vibration <b>absorbers</b> {{can be used as}} an alternative treatment. The objective {{of this study is to}} provide a dynamic modeling of the human hand that describes the biodynamic response of Parkinson’s patients and to design an effective tuned vibration absorber able to suppress their pathological tremor. The hand is modeled as a three degrees-of-freedom (DOF) system describing the flexion motion at the proximal joints on the horizontal plane. Resting tremor is modeled as dual harmonic excitation due to shoulder and elbow muscle activation operating at resonance frequencies. The performance of the single dynamic vibration absorber (DVA) is studied when attached to the forearm and compared with the dual DVA tuned at both excitation frequencies. Equations of motion are derived and solved using the complex transfer function of the non-Lagrangian system. The absorber’s systems are designed as a stainless steel alloy cantilevered beam with an attached copper mass. The dual DVA was the most efficient absorber which reduces 98. 3 %– 99. 5 %, 97. 0 %– 97. 3 % and 97. 4 %– 97. 5 % of the Parkinson’s tremor amplitude at the shoulder, elbow and wrist joint...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>mechanical</b> energy <b>absorbers</b> as an {{alternative}} to conventional hydraulic and mechanical snubbers for piping supports has attracted a wide interest among researchers and practitioners in the nuclear industry. The basic design concept of energy absorbers (EA) is to dissipate the vibration energy of piping systems through nonlinear hysteretic actions of EA!s under design seismic loads. Therefore, some type of nonlinear analysis needs to be performed in the seismic design of piping systems with EA supports. The equivalent linearization approach (ELA) can be a practical analysis tool for this purpose, particularly when the response approach (RSA) is also incorporated in the analysis formulations. In this paper, the following ELA/RSA methods are presented and compared to each other regarding their practice and numerical accuracy: Response approach using the square root of sum of squares (SRSS) approximation (denoted RS in this paper). Classical ELA based on modal combinations and linear random vibration theory (denoted CELA in this paper). Stochastic ELA based on direct solution of response covariance matrix (denoted SELA in this paper). New algorithms to convert response spectra to the equivalent power spectral density (PSD) functions are presented for both the above CELA and SELA methods.

40|$|Keratins are {{intermediate}} filament (IF) {{proteins that}} form complex filament systems in epithelial cells, thus serving as scaffolding elements and <b>mechanical</b> stress <b>absorbers.</b> The {{building blocks of}} keratin IFs are parallel coiled-coil dimers of two distinct sequence-related proteins distinguished as type I and type II keratins. To gain more insight into their structural dynamics, we resorted to hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry of keratins K 8 and K 18, which are characteristic for simple epithelial cells. Using this powerful technique not employed with IFs before, we mapped patterns of protected versus unprotected regions in keratin complexes at various assembly levels. In particular, we localized protein segments exhibiting different hydrogen exchange patterns in tetramers versus filaments. We observed a general pattern of precisely positioned regions of stability intertwining with flexible regions, mostly represented by the non-α-helical segments. Notably, some regions within the coiled-coil domains are significantly more dynamic than others, while the IF-consensus motifs at the end domains of the central α-helical “rod” segment, which mediate the “head-to-tail” dimer–dimer interaction in the filament elongation process, become distinctly more protected upon formation of filaments. Moreover, to gain more insight into {{the dynamics of the}} individual keratins, we investigated the properties of homomeric preparations of K 8 and K 18. The physiological importance of keratins without a partner is encountered in both pathological and experimental situations when one of the two species is present in robust excess or completely absent, such as in gene-targeted mice...|$|R
40|$|Fat is {{not just}} used by the body as bulk tissue. In {{addition}} to its role in storing energy and regulating hormone action, fat is used {{in some parts of}} the body for its mechanical properties. The anatomy of anterior knee fat is more complex than it appears at first sight and is capable of withstanding considerable compressive and shear stress. Specific lesions occur when such mechanical stress exceeds the physiological limits and are yet little known. Superficial fat can be the site of either acute injury by closed degloving called the Morel-Lavallée lesion or chronic injury, when subject to repeat excessive shear forces, due to more complex and less well-defined disruptions that result in pseudo-bursitis. There are three main anterior, intracapsular and extrasynovial fat pads in the knee joint, which are the infrapatellar fat pad (IFP) or Hoffa's fat pad, the quadriceps fat pad and the prefemoral fat pad. The IFP plays an important role as a <b>mechanical</b> shock <b>absorber</b> and guides the patella tendon and even the patella itself during flexion-extension movements. In response to repeated excessive stress, an inflammatory reaction and swelling of the IFP is first observed, followed by a fibrotic reaction with metaplastic transformation into fibrous, cartilaginous or bone tissue. More rarely, the two other deep fat pads (quadriceps and prefemoral) can, if subject to repeated stress, undergo similar restructuring inflammatory reactions with metaplasia resulting in tissue hardening, anterior pain and partial loss of functio...|$|R
40|$|Piezoelectric {{transducers}} {{can be used}} {{to harvest}} electrical energy from structural vibrations in order to power continuously operating condition monitoring systems local to where they operate. However, excessive vibrations can compromise the safe operation of <b>mechanical</b> systems. Therefore, <b>absorbers</b> are commonly used to control vibrations. With an integrated device, the mechanical energy that otherwise would be dissipated can be converted via piezoelectric transducers. Vibration absorbers are designed to have high damping factors. Hence, the integration of transducers would lead to a low energy conversion. Efficient energy harvesters usually have low damping capabilities; therefore, they are not effective for vibration suppression. Thus, the design of an integrated device needs to consider the two conflicting requirements on the damping. This study focuses on the development of a laboratory test rig with a host structure and a vibration absorber with tunable damping via an active relative velocity feedback. A voice coil actuator is used for this purpose. To overcome the passive damping effects of the back electromagnetic force a novel voltage feedback control is proposed, which has been validated both in simulation and experimentally. The aim {{of this study is to}} have a test rig ready for the introduction of piezo-transducers and available for future experimental evaluations of the damping effect on the effectiveness of vibration reduction and energy harvesting efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Time {{delays in}} {{feedback}} control systems have intrigued researchers especially {{over the past}} five decades. Some recent studies have discovered that deliberate introduction of delays within certain control laws yields favorable results. This work follows the same philosophy and stems from a pedigree of research where delays are viewed as a tool, and their unique features are exploited. Delayed Resonators use the destabilizing effect of delays to induce resonance in an active vibration absorber, providing complete vibration suppression against time varying tonal disturbances. Inspired by these developments, this work embarks on another exploration on systems that harvest energy from mechanical vibrations. In this research, an analytical framework is developed on generic active <b>mechanical</b> vibration <b>absorbers</b> with delayed feedback control. The interplay between the generated and consumed energy is investigated from a physics viewpoint. It is shown that energy harvesting capacity can be significantly enhanced by introducing a properly designed time-delayed feedback. A critical feature in this work is the use of piezoelectric materials. Considerable research has been devoted to the use of piezoelectric components for both vibration control and energy harvesting. Piezoelectricity provides a bi-directional coupling between mechanical strain and electrical fields. This allows the use of resistive-inductive electrical circuits, which are reconfigured to serve as resonators for mechanical structures. In this work, time-delayed control laws are devised for such systems, primarily to serve two purposes: (a) effective vibration suppression and (b) increased energy harvesting. The essence of the scientific contribution lies at the point that the electrical circuit is actively sensitized to replace a conventional proof-mass absorber (or harvester). This idea could evolve into a design mechanism which has many advantages, such as compactness, reduced weight, and deployment practicality. An experimental setup, consisting of a cantilever beam with piezoelectric patches connected to a shunt circuit, is constructed to demonstrate the core concepts in this effort. Delayed proportional control is applied within the electrical circuit to test the analytical findings. As expected, many practical issues are encountered and addressed during this effort. Favorable experimental results on vibration control and energy harvesting are presented and discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mechanical</b> tuned {{vibration}} <b>absorbers</b> (MTVAs) are devices used {{to mitigate}} the vibrations of a structure around one of its eigenfrequencies. By introducing an additional degree of freedom in the structure, MTVAs allow to split the peak {{of interest in the}} frequency response in two peaks with lower amplitudes. The design of MTVAs is usually based on the (approximate) equal-peak method proposed by Den Hartog. A closed-form exact solution was however obtained by Asami and Nishihara, for which the two peaks of the frequency response have exactly the same amplitude. Similarly to MTVAs, piezoelectric tuned vibration absorbers (PTVAs) allow to damp efficiently a specific peak of the frequency response. Although a pole placement technique can be used to design such devices, tuning rules are usually based on approximate equal-peak methods which define the optimum values of the resistor and the inductance of the shunt. Very recently, Asami and Nishihara’s exact solution has been extended for the equal-peak method to PTVAs by the authors of the present paper. The first contribution {{of this paper is to}} illustrate this new optimum design of a series RL piezoelectric shunt on a realistic example. A clamped-free steel plate excited with two piezoelectric actuators and shunted with two piezoelectric transducers is modelled using plate elements (laminates). Non-linearity is then introduced in the host structure, and a new non-linear PTVA for mitigating the vibrations of the non-linear host structure is proposed. The improvement of damping performances in the presence of structural non-linearties using a non-linear PTVA is illustrated. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of ionized X-ray absorbing layers of gas {{along the line}} of sight to the nuclei of Seyfert galaxies is a well established observational fact. This material is systematically outflowing and shows a large range in parameters. However, its actual nature and dynamics are still not clear. In order to gain insights into these important issues we performed a literature search for papers reporting the parameters of the soft X-ray warm absorbers (WAs) in 35 type 1 Seyferts and compared their properties to those of the ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) detected in the same sample. The fraction of sources with WAs is > 60 %, consistent with previous studies. The fraction of sources with UFOs is > 34 %, > 67 % of which also show WAs. The large dynamic range obtained when considering all the absorbers together allows us, for the first time, to investigate general relations among them. In particular, we find significant correlations indicating that the closer the absorber is to the central black hole, the higher the ionization, column, outflow velocity and consequently the <b>mechanical</b> power. The <b>absorbers</b> continuously populate the whole parameter space, with the WAs and the UFOs lying always at the two ends of the distribution. This strongly suggest that these absorbers, often considered of different types, could actually represent parts of a single large-scale stratified outflow observed at different locations from the black hole. The observed parameters and correlations are consistent with both radiation pressure through Compton scattering and MHD processes contributing to the outflow acceleration, the latter playing a major role. Most of the absorbers, especially the UFOs, have a sufficiently high mechanical power to significantly contribute to AGN feedback. Comment: Manuscript updated to match the MNRAS published version.
