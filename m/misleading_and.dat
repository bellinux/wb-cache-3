Africa Check warned that some polls are intentionally <b>misleading</b> <b>and</b> some are essentially conjecture.|$|E
5|$|Although Benchley {{was known}} for <b>misleading</b> <b>and</b> fictional autobiographical {{statements}} about himself (at one point asserting that he wrote A Tale of Two Cities before being buried at Westminster Abbey), he actually was the great-grandchild of the founder of Benchley, Texas, Henry Wetherby Benchley, who was jailed for his help with the Underground Railroad. Robert Benchley was born on September 15, 1889, in Worcester, Massachusetts, the son of Maria Jane (Moran) and Charles Henry Benchley.|$|E
5|$|A 1989 {{document}} generally {{known as}} Aspects of Christian meditation set forth {{the position of}} the Holy See with respect to the differences between Christian and eastern styles of meditation. The document, issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops, stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and <b>misleading,</b> <b>and</b> may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation. The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation {{should not be confused with}} prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be a flight from the self, can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{legislation}} is observed {{with high levels of}} compliance, but not uniformly throughout the country. There are not mandatory fines for smoking transgressions, although the newest 2016 anti-smoking campaign has seen fines issued and offenders threatened with images of them being broadcast on TV. Tobacco packaging warning messages are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in any way. They are usually printed in small print {{on the side of the}} package and only state that smoking is harmful to health. However, the descriptions must state the nicotine and tar content, must not be <b>misleading</b> <b>and</b> do need to be approved by local authorities. Graphic warning images that are now common worldwide have never appeared on packaging.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are <b>misleading</b> <b>and</b> that we should use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.|$|E
5|$|List of United States {{business}} school rankings is a tabular listing {{of some of}} the {{business school}}s and their affiliated universities located in the United States that are included in {{one or more of the}} rankings of full-time Master of Business Administration programs. Rankings are typically published by magazines or websites. This list is not a comprehensive list of business schools in the United States. These rankings are a subset of college and university rankings. Business schools are university-level institutions generally affiliated with a university or college that produces students who attain business administration degrees. Most of the schools listed in the rankings below are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Some of the publications shown here have related rankings for undergraduate, part-time and executive curricula. There is currently some controversy among faculty and administrators in American institutions of higher education regarding the request by the surveyors to have college presidents give their subjective opinion of other colleges because some of the methodologies are deemed <b>misleading</b> <b>and</b> a disservice. This has resulted in a movement surrounding the President's letter.|$|E
500|$|Shultz and Godson {{note that}} after the Soviet term dezinformatsia became widely known in the 1980s in the English {{language}} as disinformation, native speakers of English broadened the term as [...] "any government communication (either overt or covert) containing intentionally false <b>and</b> <b>misleading</b> material, often combined selectively with true information, which seeks to <b>mislead</b> <b>and</b> manipulate either elites or a mass audience." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{programme}} Scoop on TVB, {{the dominant}} terrestrial television channel in Hong Kong, on 1 April drew criticism. The strikers {{objected to the}} programme, saying it was biased, <b>misleading</b> <b>and</b> did not give enough airtime to the strikers. The Communications Authority had received 1,800 complaints within four days and TVB said it had received 47 complaints from the audience, and the broadcaster had no particular stance.|$|E
25|$|Philip Booth {{says that}} the selling {{techniques}} used by some sellers and some supporters of Fairtrade are bullying, <b>misleading,</b> <b>and</b> unethical. There are problems {{with the use of}} boycott campaigns and other pressure to force sellers to stock a product they think ethically suspect. However, the opposite has been argued, that a more participatory and multi-stakeholder approach to auditing might improve the quality of the process.|$|E
25|$|Bra-labeling systems used {{around the}} world are at times <b>misleading</b> <b>and</b> confusing. Cup and band sizes vary {{around the world}}. In {{countries}} that have adopted the European EN 13402 dress-size standard, the torso is measured in centimetres and rounded to the nearest multiple of 5cm. Bra-fitting experts in the United Kingdom state that many women who buy off the rack without professional assistance wear up to two sizes too small.|$|E

In many instances, the ATAIU relied on the assistance of indigenous work crews to retrieve the downed aircraft from remote areas and transport them to the coast, often dragging them through swamps or floating them down rivers on rafts.|$|E
25|$|Ringbone is {{exostosis}} (bone growth) in the pastern or coffin {{joint of}} a horse. In severe cases, the growth can encircle the bones, giving ringbone its name. It {{has been suggested}} by some authors that such a colloquial term, whilst commonly used, might be <b>misleading</b> <b>and</b> {{that it would be}} better to refer to this condition as osteoarthritis of the inter-phalangeal joints in ungulates (Rogers and Waldron, 1995: 34-35).|$|E
5000|$|Many critics attack {{politicians}} {{for being}} {{out of touch with}} the public.

25|$|Ramsey {{states that}} investors {{can get a}} 12% average annual return {{and this is the}} number he uses in {{financial}} analyses. Critics state that using an average annual return rate is <b>misleading</b> <b>and</b> that the compound annual growth rate is a better measurement when planning investments. Most individuals are unaware of this difference. Critics have also stated that a 12% return is unrealistic. According to the Motley Fool, following Ramsey's calculations could cause individuals to be seriously under-invested for retirement.|$|E
25|$|Voluntary, non-voluntary and {{involuntary}} types can {{be further}} divided into passive or active variants. Passive euthanasia entails the withholding treatment necessary for the continuance of life. Active euthanasia entails the use of lethal substances or forces, (such as administering a lethal injection), and is the more controversial. While some authors consider these terms to be <b>misleading</b> <b>and</b> unhelpful, they are nonetheless commonly used. In some cases, such as the administration of increasingly necessary, but toxic doses of painkillers, there is a debate {{whether or not to}} regard the practice as active or passive.|$|E
25|$|Charles, {{like his}} father Oscar I, was an {{advocate}} of Scandinavianism and the political solidarity of the three northern kingdoms, and his friendship with Frederick VII of Denmark, it is said, led him to give half promises of help to Denmark {{on the eve of}} the war of 1864, which, in the circumstances, were perhaps <b>misleading</b> <b>and</b> unjustifiable. In view, however, of the unpreparedness of the Swedish army and the difficulties of the situation, Charles was forced to observe a strict neutrality. He died in Malmö on 18 September 1872.|$|E
