An equivalent circuit approach (PEEC) is employed to evaluate path-independent voltage on the conductor. The transient <b>surge</b> <b>impedance</b> is then computed in time domain until the reflected surge is back to the observation point. It is found that transient <b>surge</b> <b>impedance</b> increases as time goes on, and is determined by geometry of the conductor and waveform of the injected surge current. The transient <b>surge</b> <b>impedance</b> is neither affected by conductor height nor grounding resistance.

40|$|Abstract—Winding {{failures}} in induction machines {{have been a}} major concern in the past several years, and more so recently with the addition of variable speed drives (VSDs). Both the introduction of the vacuum breaker, and the use of pulse width modulation (PWM) drives, utilizing fast switching IGBT’s, have resulted in an increase in winding {{failures in}} induction machines. Two mechanisms that cause winding failures are steep-fronted surges, like those caused during the opening and closing of vacuum breakers, and transient overvoltages caused by impedance mismatch between the cable and load during VSD operation. There has been a fair amount of work done to date on the propagation of vacuum breaker induced steep-fronted surges in the windings of the induction machine. More recently, work has been progressing on overvoltages at the machine terminals as a result of VSD’s operating with long cables connecting drive and machine. However the propagation of these surges down the coils and the interference of these PWM surges with each other in the coils as well as the coupling between turns and coils have not been thoroughly investigated. Such an investigation would allow more benign PWM strategies to be developed, which do not build up in the machine to unacceptably high levels. To this end, this paper presents a measurement technique which can be used to study PWM generated surges and their propagation within the coil, considering each turn at a time. This requires the inclusion of the differences in the <b>surge</b> <b>impedances</b> in each section of the coil. Detailed parameter measurements are made of each turn section (slot vs. overhang), which are then used to determine the <b>surge</b> <b>impedance</b> of each section. Reflection and refraction coefficients are calculated, then used to map, via lattice diagrams, the propagation of surges within the turns of one coil...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{represents}} two methodologies for calculating lightning discharge process, {{which is}} the basis for comparing two different software products. The tower <b>surge</b> <b>impedance</b> is deeply related to geometric shapes. However, due to the existence of complex transmission line structures, computing <b>surge</b> <b>impedance</b> is not easy. Besides, due to variety of structures of different shapes and sizes, a general equation encompassing all cases is impossible. In this way, equations obtained from simple geometric shapes, such as cylinders and cones, representing various types of towers, were developed [3]. Tower could be represented as inductance connecting shield wires to ground, constant-impedance transmission line, variable-impedance transmission line, or radiating structure. With adequate approximation, travel time can be represented as t=h/c, where t[s] is time, h[m] is tower height and c[m/s] is speed of light. Many experimental and theoretical studies of tower response have been initiated. Scientists Wagner and Hileman found the transient impedance of a cylinder to an impressed surge {{at the top of the}} tower. Sargent and Darveniza noted that a cone has constant transient impedance and derived average impedance of cylinder. Chisholm, Chow and Srivastava found that impedance depends on direction of injection, with vertical injection to cylinders and cones agreeing with and horizontal injection matching experiments using this geometry [3, 4]. The analysis of lightning performance is fundamental when designing new lines and for uprating existing lines to higher voltages. There are a number of issues in creation of approximate model of lightning discharge into power line tower; towers have not uniform structure and different dimensions and geometry. This paper describes process of power line’s tower model creation for further modelling using software on electromagnetic transient program. The amplitude of the lightning current and its impact place is one of the main characteristics of the lightning discharge. Traditional remedy of lightning protections (ground wire) do not always protect phase conductors against lightning strikes. When lightning strikes in the grounding cable their performance is heavily dependent on HV tower’s ground resistance. The lightning-proof assessing calculations of lightning’s currents amplitude must be adjusted according to the equivalent resistance of the stroked object (ground wire, badly grounded ground wire or overhead tower) ...|$|R

Off-shore collection grids consist of vast amount of cables, with different length and connection points, which have low <b>surge</b> <b>impedance</b> compared with overhead lines. Consequently multiple pre-strikes and re-ignitions of switching apparatus with cables can cause transient overvoltages with higher time-derivatives than with overhead lines.

30|$|The {{demand of}} {{electrical}} energy is ever increasing, {{as a rule}} of thumb it doubles every 10  years. In order to meet the growing power demand, power transfer capacity of the transmission lines is required to be enhanced continuously. The Right of Way (ROW) is the most remarkable challenge that the transmission sector is facing today. Thus, there is a need to enhance the power transfer capability of existing transmission corridor in an environmental friendly manner, rather than on constructing new transmission lines. In this regard, six phase transmission line was proposed by L.D Barthold and H.C. Barnes in 1972, as a potential alternative to cope up with ever increasing power demand, by transferring 73  % more power with efficient utilization of existing structure of three phase double circuit line (Stewart and Wilson 1978 a, b). Apart from enhanced power transfer capability, six phase transmission systems offer several other advantages over conventional three phase system such as: reduced conductor surface gradient, potentially lower audible noise levels and radio interference levels, better thermal loading capacity and <b>surge</b> <b>impedance</b> loading, lesser corona, good voltage regulation and higher efficiency, complete compatibility with existing three phase double circuit line and economic viability (Stewart and Wilson 1978 a, b; Stewart and Grant 1982; Stewart et al. 1984; Venkata et al. 1982 a, b). Inspite of the advantages of six phase transmission system, its low popularity is attributed to the absence of a reliable and efficient protection scheme.|$|R

In the present work we show that in a time-matched plasma focus shot we deduce the value of axial phase current fraction fc simply by measuring the calibrated voltage waveform and the uncalibrated current waveform. The scaling parameters b and d are fixed; and by form-fitting the measured current waveform to the normalised current waveform using the value of a of the shot is determined uniquely; from which the peak current and the ratio of peak to average speed [the speed form factor (SFF) ] are obtained. The average transit speed is measured by time-of-flight using the voltage upturn as indicator of end of axial phase. Then the SFF yields the peak speed. The measured voltage (back EMF), peak current and peak axial speed (all at the end of axial phase) allows the unambiguous measurement of fc. The value of the mass swept-up fraction fm is deduced from a which is the ratio of the characteristic discharge and the characteristic transit times, both deduced during the non-dimensionalisation of the equations.
