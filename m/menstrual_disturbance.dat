40|$|AbstractProblem: Menstrual disorders, reduced {{fertility}} and sexual problems {{seem to be}} more frequent in women with epilepsy than in the general population. Most investigations concerning <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances</b> in epilepsy patients, however, are small and based on selected materials. We therefore wanted to investigate the frequency of <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances</b> in a large, unselected population of epilepsy patients. Methods: A retrospective, questionnaire study of a cohort of female outpatients, aged 18 – 45 was conducted. Each patient chose a close female friend who served as control, to optimise matching regarding age and lifestyle. Results: Answers were received from 265 patients and 142 controls. <b>Menstrual</b> <b>disturbances</b> were more frequent in patients with epilepsy (48. 0 %) than in controls (30. 7 %) (P= 0. 004). <b>Menstrual</b> <b>disturbances</b> were more frequent in patients on polytherapy versus monotherapy (P= 0. 049) and more frequent in patients with high seizure frequency (> 5 seizures/year) compared to patients with a lower seizure frequency or those seizure free (P= 0. 006). The frequency of <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances</b> was higher in patients on valproate compared to carbamazepine monotherapy (P= 0. 045). Conclusion: This investigation confirms that women with epilepsy have an increased frequency of <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances</b> compared to women without epilepsy. In women with high seizure frequency and in those on polytherapy, the frequency of <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances</b> are further increased.

METHODS: The case of a woman treated with ECT for depression that developed <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances</b> early {{in the course of}} the treatment is presented. We conducted a PubMed literature search, supplemented with an Internet (Google) search using the same strategy, and a hand search of the indexes of textbooks on ECT. RESULTS: Publications on the emergence of <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances</b> during ECT are virtually nonexistent, although some textbooks mention amenorrhea as a possible adverse effect of ECT. The mechanism of ECT-related amenorrhea is unknown but is supposed to be related to the transient hyperprolactinemia.

40|$|Background: During {{the last}} decades {{the number of women}} {{participating}} in sports has increased dramatically. Although exercise has beneficial health effects for most of these women, we now realize that strenuous exercise may also have serious medical consequences. Menstrual dysfunction is common among athletes and the exact mechanisms are not known. The metabolic consequences of long-standing amenorrhea are serious including increased bone resorption and possibly deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system. Oral contraceptives (OCs) are often used for treatment of estrogen deficiency but there are no studies evaluating the effects of this treatment in athletes. The aims of this work were to study mechanisms of menstrual disturbances and associated metabolic disorders in endurance athletes. Furthermore, to evaluate effects of OCs on bone mineral density (BMD), endothelial function and physical performance in athletes. Methods: Age- and body mass index-matched groups of endurance athletes with <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbance,</b> regularly cycling athletes and sedentary controls, all together 51 subjects, were examined before and after - 10 months of treatment with a low-dose, monophasic, combined OC. Baseline hormonal status and diurnal profiles of pituitary hormones and steroid hormones were investigated. Body composition including BMD was examined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and physical performance was evaluated by endurance and strength tests. Blood lipids were analyzed and endothelial function was studied by ultrasound assessment of flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD). Results: The majority of athletes with <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbance</b> had a hormonal profile in accordance with hypothalamic inhibition of the reproductive system including decreased diurnal LH-pulsatility and peak amplitude of prolactin and increased diurnal secretion of cortisol and growth hormone. This group of athletes had the lowest fat mass and BMD among all groups. In addition, we identified a hyperandrogenic subgroup of athletes with <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbance,</b> having increased diurnal secretion of testosterone, increased LH/FSH ratio and decreased serum levels of SHBG. This subgroup had an anabolic body composition with the highest total BMD and lean body mass among the groups. The hyperandrogenic subgroup also had the highest V 02 max and the highest performance values in general. Athletes with amenorrhea had impaired endothelial function and an unfavorable lipid profile, whereas oligomenorrheic athletes had the most favorable lipid profile and an intermediate FMD. OC treatment caused a significant change in weight and fat mass only in the athlete group with <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbance.</b> OC treatment also increased BMD in athletes with the largest increase in those with a low BMD at baseline. Despite significant changes in body composition, only a small impact on physical performance was recorded during OC. Endothelial dysfunction in amenorrheic athletes was improved by OC treatment. Conclusions: Menstrual disturbances in female athletes are often explained as a consequence of hypothalamic inhibition due to energy deficiency. This thesis suggests essential hyperandrogenism, such as polycystic ovary syndrome as an alternative mechanism underlying <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbance</b> in athletes, especially oligomenorrhea. This condition may imply an advantage for physical performance. Amenorrhea in athletes is associated with endothelial dysfunction and an unfavorable lipid profile. OC treatment has predominantly beneficial effects on body composition, BMD and endothelial function without adverse effects on physical performance and could be used for prevention of osteoporosis in athletic amenorrhea...|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{hopes to}} {{investigate}} the underlying incidence of hypothyroidism among patients presenting with menstrual disturbances, including, {{but not limited to}} menorrhagia. Methodology: The cross-sectional analysis was conducted mutually by the department of obstetrics & gynecology and the department medicine at Liaquat university hospital, Hyderabad, a tertiary care hospital, upon a total of 380 patients from June 2016 to January 2017. Written informed consent was acquired from the patient before using the obtained data as part of this research. Results: Of the 380 patients suffering from <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbance</b> and irregular periods, 60 patients suffered from oligomenorrhoea and 200 from menorrhagia i. e. the most common feature in the sample set. 66 of the patients had subclinical hypothyroidism, 33 had mild hypothyroidism and 112 had severe underlying hypothyroidism. Among the non-euthyroid individuals 29 had normal periods while the rest suffered from menstrual disturbances. (0 ligomenorrhia: 19, Menorrhagia: 52 and others: 12). Conclusion: After careful consideration and deliberation on the obtained results, it is clear that hypothyroidism in women is frequently associated with menstrual disturbances. Also, irregularities in menstruation are often more prevalent in severer cases of hypothyroidism as compared to when the condition (hypothyroidism) is mild or moderate mild cases. The most common irregularity of menstruation was found to be menorrhagia.

40|$|There are few data {{available}} about the menstrual patterns of Australian teenagers and {{the prevalence of}} menstrual disorder in this age group. Aims To establish the typical experience of menstruation {{in a sample of}} 16 - 18 year old women attending ACT Secondary Colleges of Education. To determine the number of teenagers experiencing menstrual disorder that could require further investigation and management. The MDOT questionnaire was used to survey participants about their usual pattern of menstruation, signs and symptoms experienced with menses and how menstruation affected various aspects of their lives including school attendance, completion of school work, relationships, social, sexual and physical activity. Data analysis included exploration of aggregated data, as well as individual scrutiny of each questionnaire to determine <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbance</b> requiring follow up. Those participants whose questionnaire indicated a requirement for further investigation, and who consented to being contacted, were followed up through an MDOT Clinic. Results: One thousand and fifty one (1, 05 1) completed questionnaires - 98 % response rate. The typical experience of menstruation in the MDOT sample includes: bleeding patterns within normal parameters for this age group; menstrual pain, 94 %; cramping pain, 71 %; symptoms associated with menstruation, 98. 4 %; PMS symptoms, 96 %; mood disturbance before or during periods, 73 %; school absence related to menstruation, 26 %; high menstrual interference on one or more life activity, 55. 8 %; asymptomatic menstruation, 1 %; True response to 'My periods seem pretty normal' 7 1. 4 %. Statistically significant associations were found between each and all of: menstrual pain, symptoms, interference on life activities and school absence. The prevalence of significant <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbance</b> in the sample is approximately 25 % where: 2 1 % experienced severe pain; 26 % reported school absence; 33 % had seen a GP about periods; 26. 9 % think {{there is something wrong with}} periods; 23. 5 % require follow up based on individual scrutiny of each questionnaire; 10 - 14 % require further investigation to rule out endometriosis. Referral and investigation of menstrual pain, symptoms, and diagnosis of menstrual pathology in the sample was low. Conclusion The MDOT questionnaire has helped to establish a clearer picture of typical menstruation in the population sample. Where 1 % of girls reported having asymptomatic menstruation, the majority of teenagers in the study reported menstrual pain and symptoms that could be experienced as part of the dysmenorrhoeic syndrome of symptoms, PMS, or underlying pathology such as endometriosis. Due to the overlap in symptoms and a propensity to be dismissive of menstrual pain and symptoms, many girls are suffering menstrual morbidities that could be well managed with NSAIDs and the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) if non-pathological, or investigated further if a menstrual pathology is suspected. Considering these results the reported school absence rate of 26 % is not surprising. Whilst this study does not cost the true impact of <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbance</b> on schooling, the results of the MDOT questionnaire reflect significant physical and emotional impact on a considerable number of teenager's lives which could also have repercussions on education, schooling performance and other areas of their lives. Future research is planned to determine the MDOT questionnaire's validity for identifying pathological menstrual disorder so it can act as a screening tool to facilitate earlier detection. Replication of the MDOT study should be done in younger teenagers (from menarche) to determine <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbance</b> in the younger age group...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. BACKGROUND: The {{identification}} of subtle <b>menstrual</b> cycle <b>disturbances</b> requires daily hormone assessments. In contrast, {{the identification of}} severe <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances,</b> such as amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea, can be established by clinical observation. The primary {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the frequency of subtle <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances,</b> defined as luteal phase defects (LPD) or anovulation, in exercising women, with menstrual cycles of 26 - 35 days, who engage in a variety of sports, both recreational and competitive. Secondly, the prevalence of oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea was also determined via measurement of daily urinary ovarian steroids rather than self report alone. METHODS: Menstrual status was documented by daily measurements of estrone and pregnanediol glucuronide and luteinizing hormone across two to three consecutive cycles and subsequently categorized as ovulatory (Ovul), LPD, anovulatory (Anov), oligomenorrheic (Oligo) and amenorrheic (Amen) in sedentary (Sed) and exercising (Ex) women. RESULTS: Sed (n = 20) and Ex women (n = 67) were of similar (P > 0. 05) age (26. 3 +/- 0. 8 years), weight (59. 3 +/- 1. 8 kg), body mass index (22. 0 +/- 0. 6 kg/m 2), age of menarche (12. 8 +/- 0. 3 years) and gynecological maturity (13. 4 +/- 0. 9 years). The Sed group exercised less (P < 0. 001) (96. 7 +/- 39. 1 versus 457. 1 +/- 30. 5 min/week) and had a lower peak oxygen uptake (34. 4 +/- 1. 4 versus 44. 3 +/- 0. 6 ml/kg/min) than the Ex group. Among the menstrual cycles studied in the Sed group, the prevalence of subtle <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances</b> was only 4. 2 % (2 / 48); 95. 8 % (46 / 48) of the observed menstrual cycles were ovulatory. This finding stands in stark contrast to that observed in the Ex group where only 50 % (60 / 120) of the observed menstrual cycles were ovulatory and as many as 50 % (60 / 120) were abnormal. Of the abnormal cycles in the Ex group, 29. 2 % (35 / 120) were classified as LPD (short, inadequate or both) and 20. 8 % (25 / 120) were classified as Anov. Among the cycles of Ex women with severe <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances,</b> 3. 5 % (3 / 86) of the cycles were Oligo and 33. 7 % (29 / 86) were Amen. No cycles of Sed women (0 / 20) displayed either Oligo or Amen. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that approximately half of exercising women experience subtle <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances,</b> i. e. LPD and anovulation, and that one third of exercising women may be amenorrheic. Estimates of the prevalence of subtle <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances</b> in exercising women determined by the presence or absence of short or long cycles does not identify these disturbances. In light of known clinical consequences of <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances,</b> these findings underscore the lack of reliability of normal menstrual intervals and self report to infer menstrual status...|$|R

The association between menstrual irregularity and bone mass was partially mediated by markers of androgen status especially free testosterone. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Hypothalamic {{dysfunction}} is a {{cause of}} <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances</b> in women, in whom other diseases have been discarded. This condition {{is characterized by a}} failure of the GNRH pulse generation system and is associated to psychological and environmental factors. A lack of ovulatory response to the administration of clomiphene can be a sign of bad prognosis in hypothalamic dysfunction. Aim: To report the natural history of patients with hypothalamic dysfunction and a bad or deficient response to the administration of clomiphene. Patients and methods: Fifty patients with hypothalamic dysfunction, that consulted for <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances</b> at the age of 15 to 20 years old, were studied. All received clomiphene and 31 had an ovulatory response, 12 had menses without ovulation and 7 did not menstruate. Of these 19 women eleven were interviewed again about their menstrual and reproductive history, after a lapse of 9 to 17 years of loss from follow up. Results: Eight of the eleven women had stressful events during adolescence (going away from family house in 3, starting university studies in 3, migration out of the natal country in one and non competitive physical activity in one). All restarted their menses and eight with active sexual life had spontaneous pregnancies, giving birth from two to five children. Ovulatory cycles were documented in women without active sexual life. Conclusions: In teenagers with hypothalamic dysfunction and <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances,</b> a deficient or bad response to clomiphene does not necessarily indicate a bad prognosis in terms of menses or fertility (Rev Méd Chile 2002; 130 : 745 - 52...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recent {{studies have}} {{raised the issue of}} an {{increased}} incidence of polycystic ovaries (PCO) and <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances</b> in women with epilepsy treated with valproate (VPA). It seems that antiepileptic drugs, especially valproate, may have a functional role in altering the endocrine system of child-bearing women with epilepsy. We conducted this study to investigate the association of VPA and ovarian structural/menstrual disorders in epileptic women. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we compared a total of 64 epileptic patients, aged 16 - 45 years, 32 of whom had been taking VPA alone and 32 were on other antiepileptic drugs for a minimum duration of six months. Ovarian sonography was performed and body mass index (BMI) calculated for all subjects. We also recorded the presence of <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances</b> in both groups. Results: Fifteen (46 %) of the VPA subjects had PCO compared to 7 (21. 9 %) of the other group. In the VPA group, four (12. 5 %) had oligomenorrhea, one (3. 1 %) amenorrhea and 13 (40. 6 %) had irregular menstrual cycles. However, from the other group, two (6. 3 %) subjects had oligomenorrhea and seven (21. 9 %) had irregular menstrual cycles; amenorrhea was not present in the non-VPA treated patients. Mean BMI was 22. 5 kg/m 2 among the VPA subjects and 20. 1 kg/m 2 in the non-VPA subjects. Conclusions: This study supports the association of PCO and high BMI with VPA treatment. The frequency of <b>menstrual</b> <b>disturbances</b> did not differ significantly between the two groups...|$|R
