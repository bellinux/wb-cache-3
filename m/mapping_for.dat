VJ-61 was {{assigned}} to the Pacific Fleet and VJ-62 to the Atlantic Fleet. The squadrons never deployed as complete units, but rather deployed as one to three aircraft detachments. Detachment Queen was formed by VJ-61 during the Korean War at Naval Station Sangley Point, in the Philippines, to fly reconnaissance missions over the People's Republic of China and North Korea. The detachment continued its missions after the war until at least June 1954. Both squadrons frequently provided photographic <b>mapping</b> <b>for</b> agencies outside the Navy like the Army Map Service, Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, and U.S. Departments of the Interior and Agriculture. The AJ-2s in these squadrons were replaced by Douglas A3D-2P Skywarriors beginning in 1959, although the last month that they were reported in squadron service was January 1960. Surviving AJ-1 and AJ-2 aircraft became A-2As and A-2Bs, respectively, when the Department of Defense redesignated all U.S. military aircraft in a common series in 1962.|$|E

25|$|The 1980s {{also saw}} the {{widespread}} acceptance of positioning theory. Although the theory originated with Jack Trout in 1969, it didnâ€™t gain wide acceptance until Al Ries and Jack Trout wrote their classic book Positioning: The Battle For Your Mind (1979). The basic premise is that a strategy should not be judged by internal company factors but by the way customers see it relative to the competition. Crafting and implementing a strategy involves creating {{a position in the}} mind of the collective consumer. Several techniques enabled the practical use of positioning theory. Perceptual <b>mapping</b> <b>for</b> example, creates visual displays of the relationships between positions. Multidimensional scaling, discriminant analysis, factor analysis and conjoint analysis are mathematical techniques used to determine the most relevant characteristics (called dimensions or factors) upon which positions should be based. Preference regression can be used to determine vectors of ideal positions and cluster analysis can identify clusters of positions.|$|E

25|$|Genetic {{maps are}} very {{important}} to understand the structure and organization of genomes from which evolution patterns and syntenic relationships between species can be deduced. Genetic maps also provide a framework for the mapping of genes of interest and estimating the magnitude of their effects and aid our understanding of genotype/phenotype associations. DH populations have become standard resources in genetic <b>mapping</b> <b>for</b> species in which DHs are readily available. Doubled haploid populations are ideal for genetic mapping. It is possible to produce a genetic map within two years of the initial cross regardless of the species. Map construction is relatively easy using a DH population derived from a hybrid of two homozygous parents as the expected segregation ratio is simple, i.e. 1:1. DH populations have now been used to produce genetic maps of barley, rapeseed, rice, wheat, and pepper. DH populations {{played a major role in}} facilitating the generation of the molecular marker maps in eight crop species.|$|E

The Phase I models of both the acoustic and seismic sensors were only available for operation in a continuous mode, which meant that under normal conditions, their lithium batteries would function for approximately 30 days.|$|E

30|$|The {{stability}} {{analysis of}} the solution set <b>maps</b> <b>for</b> the parametric (VVI) problem is of considerable interest amongst researchers in the area. Some results on the semicontinuity of the solution set <b>maps</b> <b>for</b> the parametric (VVI) problem with the parameter perturbed {{in the space of}} parameters are now available in the literature. In [4], Khanh and Luu proved the upper semicontinuity of the solution set <b>map</b> <b>for</b> two classes of parametric vector quasivariational inequalities. In [7], Li et al. established the upper semicontinuity property of the solution set <b>map</b> <b>for</b> a perturbed generalized vector quasivariational inequality problem and also obtained the lower semicontinuity property of the solution set <b>map</b> <b>for</b> a perturbed classical scalar variational inequality. In [9], Cheng and Zhu investigated the upper and lower semicontinuities of the solution set <b>map</b> <b>for</b> a parameterized weak vector variational inequality in a finite dimensional Euclidean space by using a scalarization method. In [6], Li and Chen obtained the closedness and upper semicontinuity of the solution set <b>map</b> <b>for</b> a parametric weak vector variational inequality under weaker conditions than those assumed in [9]. Then, under a key assumption, they proved a lower semicontinuity result of the solution set map in a finite dimensional space by using a parametric gap function.|$|R

2500|$|Cortical {{stimulation}} mapping {{in patients}} with epilepsy has shown that critical language {{areas of the brain}} vary greatly in patients, highlighting the need to perform accurate mapping prior to surgeries in language areas. Traditional landmarks such as Broca's and Wernicke's areas cannot be relied on to distinguish essential language cortex. Rather, experiments that have tested for vital language sites are variable, and the exact role of a specific cortex area in a language task is difficult to judge. A further complication is that many patients who have undergone language mapping have epilepsy and it is possible this causes changes in language sites. Since the procedure is so invasive, cortical stimulation <b>mapping</b> <b>for</b> language organization is not done on healthy individuals. [...] Additionally the distribution and abundance of specific task-related language sites have shown variation based on IQ and gender.|$|E

The third Nash equilibrium is a mixed strategy which lies along the diagonal from the bottom left to top right corners.
