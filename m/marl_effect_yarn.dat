The core yarns are wrapped around the <b>effect</b> <b>yarn</b> either loosely or tightly, depending on the difference in feed rates and amount of twist used. The regularity of the loops is controlled by varying the distance between the point where the core yarns come together and the guide.

There is also no published complex guide concerning technological aspects of the production of fancy yarns. The elaboration of such guides could be time consuming and probably they would not fit exactly the requirements of rapidly changing industry and end-user demands.

Thus we can classify knop yarn as a point <b>effect</b> fancy <b>yarn,</b> and according to the tension changes we rank knop yarn as a subgroup of bunch yarns. In the knop yarn group, the component yarns change their functions during the twisting process periodically {{one of them is the}} core yarn and next it changes the function to become an <b>effect</b> <b>yarn.</b> In this way one may obtain fancy colour effects.

Some examples of broken silk thread, which spun silk or cotton yarn is used as core yarn and binding yarn, polyester filament is as used as <b>effect</b> <b>yarn,</b> are spun on the ring fancy yarn twisting machine, and physical properties of these fancy yarns are tested and analyzed.

30|$|A single {{position}} commercial {{air-jet texturing}} machine was modified to make both air-jet and steam-jet textured yarns under similar processing parameters. The machine has two feed rollers where the <b>effect</b> <b>yarn</b> overfeed {{can be changed}} from 37.9 % to 53.0 %. The machine was designed originally to supply compressed air to the texturing nozzle. At {{the start of the}} steam-jet texturing research, the machine was modified to supply either compressed air or high-pressure steam for the texturing nozzle. The jet box seal was modified to prevent steam and condensate from escaping. This also reduced the noise level and improved the safety of the steam process. Following process parameters, which are based on commercial specification in making 120 ticket number (TKT) air-jet sewing thread, have been maintained constant in the study so as to eliminate the effects of other parameters on texturing.|$|R

Chenille yarn has a very distinct weakness-it does not have very good inherent abrasion resistance. When the yarns are in use, clearly the abrasion resistance of the chenille yarn is crucially important. Either during further processing or during the eventual end-use, any removal of the <b>effect</b> <b>yarn</b> forming the beard will expose the ground yarns, which in turn will result in a bare appearance. To avoid this undesirable result, several options are available.

The yarn consists of a core, intermediate layer and outer layer in a coaxial form for accommodating fibers in different colors. The influence of fiber weight ratio of the intermediate layer to outer layer on yarn structure in terms of fiber coverage for each layer as well as yarn properties was investigated to identify the appropriate fiber weight ratio for yarn production. The results from the experiments show that the magnitude of fiber coverage of the intermediate layer on the yarn core increases {{with the increase of}} fiber weight ratio, while the fiber coverage performance of the outer layer on the intermediate layer of the yarn becomes better when a lower fiber weight ratio is adopted.
