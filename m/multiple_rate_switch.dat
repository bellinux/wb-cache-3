40|$|Abstract — A {{significant}} {{impediment to}} deployment of multicast services is the daunting technical complexity of developing, testing and validating congestion control protocols fit for wide-area deployment. Protocols such as pgmcc and TFMCC have recently made considerable {{progress on the}} single rate case, i. e. where one dynamic reception rate is maintained for all receivers in the session. However, these protocols have limited applicability, since scaling to session sizes beyond tens of participants necessitates the use of <b>multiple</b> <b>rate</b> protocols. Unfortunately, while existing <b>multiple</b> <b>rate</b> protocols exhibit better scalability, they are both less mature than single rate protocols and suffer from high complexity. We propose {{a new approach to}} <b>multiple</b> <b>rate</b> congestion control that leverages proven single rate congestion control methods by orchestrating an ensemble of independently controlled single rate sessions. We describe a new <b>multiple</b> <b>rate</b> congestion control algorithm for layered multicast sessions that employs a single rate multicast congestion control as the primary underlying control mechanism for each layer. Our new scheme combines the benefits of single rate congestion control with the scalability and flexibility of <b>multiple</b> <b>rates</b> to provide a sound <b>multiple</b> <b>rate</b> multicast congestion control policy.

40|$|PiN diodes {{are known}} to {{significantly}} contribute to switching energy {{as a result of}} reverse-recovery charge during turn-off. At high <b>switching</b> <b>rates,</b> the overlap between the high peak reserve-recovery current and the high peak voltage overshoot contributes to significant switching energy. The peak reverse-recovery current depends on the temperature and <b>switching</b> <b>rate,</b> whereas the peak diode voltage overshoot depends additionally on the stray inductance. Furthermore, the slope of the diode turn-off current is constant at high insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) <b>switching</b> <b>rates</b> and varies for low IGBT <b>switching</b> <b>rates.</b> In this paper, an analytical model for calculating PiN diode switching energy at different <b>switching</b> <b>rates</b> and temperatures is presented and validated by ultrafast and standard recovery diodes with different current ratings. Measurements of current commutation in IGBT/PiN diode pairs have been made at different <b>switching</b> <b>rates</b> and temperatures and used to validate the model. It is shown here that there is an optimal <b>switching</b> <b>rate</b> to minimize <b>switching</b> energy. The model is able to correctly predict the <b>switching</b> <b>rate</b> and temperature dependence of the PiN diode switching energies for different devices...|$|R

5000|$|Various {{parameters}} are defined and specified {{to quantify the}} performance of optical switches. The steady state performance of an optical switch (or optical switching matrix) is measured by its ability to effectively transmit optical power from an input port {{to any one of}} N output ports over the “on” state transmission path, and its ability to effectively isolate input power sources from all non-active ports over the “off” state transmission paths. Other key optical performance parameters include transmission efficiency over a range of wavelengths, the ability to minimize input optical power reflected back into the input fiber, transmission balance, and bidirectional transmission. The optical switch (or switching matrix) transient behavior is another important characteristic that is specified by its speed of response to control stimulation via the time interval it takes to either transmit or block the optical signal on any given output port. Two rates can be associated with switches: the <b>switching</b> <b>rate</b> and the signal transmission <b>rate.</b> The <b>switching</b> <b>rate</b> is the rate at which a switch changes states. The signal transmission rate is the modulation rate of information passing through a switch. The signal transmission rate is usually much greater than the <b>switching</b> <b>rate.</b> (If the <b>switching</b> <b>rate</b> approaches or exceeds the transmission <b>rate,</b> then the <b>switch</b> can be called an optical modulator.) ...|$|R

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the incidence of switching to second-line ART in sub-Saharan Africa and its main programmatic determinants. Methods: We searched 2 databases for studies reporting the incidence <b>rate</b> of <b>switching</b> to second-line ART in adults living in sub-Saharan Africa. Data on the incidence <b>rate</b> of <b>switching</b> were pooled, and random-effect models were {{used to evaluate the}} effect of factors measured at the programme level on this incidence rate. Results: Nine studies (157, 340 patients) in 21 countries were included in the meta-analysis. All studies considered patients under first-line ART and conditions to initiate ART were similar across studies. Overall, 3, 736 (2. 4 %) patients switched to second-line ART. Incidence <b>rate</b> of <b>switch</b> was in mean 2. 65 per 100 person-years (PY) (95 % confidence interval: 2. 01 – 3. 30); it ranged from 0. 42 to 4. 88 per 100 PY and from 0 to 4. 80 per 100 PY in programmes with and without viral load monitoring, respectively.

In large and finite populations, demographic fluctuations (internal noise) drive two species to extinction in a finite time, while the species with the smallest reproduction-predation rate is the most likely to be the surviving one ("law of the weakest"). Here, we model environmental (external) noise by assuming that the reproduction-predation rate of the "strongest species" (the fastest to reproduce/predate) in a given static environment randomly switches between two values corresponding to more and less favorable external conditions. We study the joint effect of environmental and demographic noise on the species survival probabilities and on the mean extinction time. In particular, we investigate whether the survival probabilities follow the law of the weakest and analyze their dependence of the external noise intensity and <b>switching</b> <b>rate.</b> Remarkably, when, on average, there is a finite number of switches prior to extinction, the survival probability of the predator of the species whose reaction <b>rate</b> <b>switches</b> typically varies non-monotonically with the external noise intensity (with optimal survival about a critical noise strength).
