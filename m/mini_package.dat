50|$|The lowered {{hardware}} {{prices for}} new (or changing) customers were compensated by cutting the free-of-charge digital tv basic package (over 110 TV channels) in half, into a free-of-charge <b>Mini</b> <b>package</b> (over 50 TV channels) and a chargeable Classic package, containing more than 60 additional TV channels. Also the former five thematic collection packages, and the HD package were folded {{into the new}} Comfort package, and aren't sold individually anymore. Customers opting to keep their existing packages are unaffected by the changes, and get the digital tv basic (now Classic) free-of-charge, and the individual collection packages as following described.|$|E
50|$|From the {{beginning}} of 2000, WCTO used Reelworld custom packages, and continues to do so. Starting on May 17, 2009, the station dropped all RW <b>packages</b> <b>minus</b> their 06 <b>package,</b> and started to broadcast a brand new jingle service at that time, Reelworld One Country.

40|$|Abstract Numerous {{studies have}} {{investigated}} using oxalic acid (OA) to control Varroa mites in honey bee colonies. In contrast, techniques for treating package bees with OA {{have not been}} investigated. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop a protocol for using OA to reduce mite infestation in package bees. We made 97 <b>mini</b> <b>packages</b> of Varroa-infested adult bees. Each package contained 1, 613 ± 18 bees and 92 ± 3 mites, and represented an experimental unit. We prepared a 2. 8 % solution of OA by mixing 35 g OA with 1 l of sugar water (sugar:water = 1 : 1; w:w). Eight treatments were assigned to the packages based on previous laboratory bioassays that characterized the acute contact toxicity of OA to mites and bees. We administered the treatments by spraying the OA solution directly on the bees through the mesh screen cage using a pressurized air brush and quantified mite and bee mortality over a 10 -day period. Our results support applying an optimum volume of 3. 0 ml of a 2. 8 % OA solution per 1, 000 bees to packages for effective mite control with minimal adult bee mortality. The outcome of our research provides beekeepers and package bee shippers guidance for using OA to reduce mite populations in package bees...|$|R

5000|$|Upon {{its release}} in May 1985, On a Storyteller's Night reached No. 24 in the UK charts and {{launched}} the band across Europe {{and is also}} notable for the stunning cover by fantasy illustrator Rodney Matthews. Two singles were released to promote the album, an alternative recording of [...] "Just Like an Arrow" [...] in March 1985 and [...] "On a Storyteller's Night" [...] in May 1985. In 2005, Sanctuary Records remastered and expanded the album for its 20th anniversary, including a bonus disc of the album's demo material. The band also toured, performing all of the tracks in their entirety for the first time.

40|$|An {{in vitro}} assay for {{measuring}} {{the activity of the}} phage lambda A-gene product has been developed. The assay is based on the observation that A-donor extracts complement A <b>minus</b> extracts for <b>packaging</b> of exogenous immature lambda DNA into phage particles. A partial purification of the A-gene product activity using this assay is presented. A method is suggested by which this A protein-dependent in vitro system might be manipulated to analyze the mechanism of reforming the lambda cohesive termini during chromosome assimilation into phage precursors...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{location and}} scale parameter modelling of the heteroscedastic t-distribution. This new distribution {{is an extension}} of the heteroscedastic Gaussian and provides robust analysis in the presence of outliers as well accommodates possible heteroscedasticity by flexibly modelling the scale parameter using covariates existing in the data. To motivate components of work in this thesis the Gaussian linear mixed model is reviewed. The mixed model equations are derived for the location fixed and random effects and this model is then used to introduce Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML). From this an algorithmic scheme to estimate the scale parameters is developed. A review of location and scale parameter modelling of the heteroscedastic Gaussian distribution is presented. In this thesis, the scale parameters are a restricted to be a function of covariates existing in the data. Maximum Likelihood (ML) and REML estimation of the location and scale parameters is derived as well as an efficient computational algorithm and software are presented. The Gaussian model is then extended by considering the heteroscedastic t distribution. Initially, the heteroscedastic t is restricted to known degrees of freedom. Scoring equations for the location and scale parameters are derived and their intimate connection to the prediction of the random scale effects is discussed. Tools for detecting and testing heteroscedasticity are also derived and a computational algorithm is presented. A <b>mini</b> software <b>package</b> " hett " using this algorithm is also discussed. To derive a REML equivalent for the heteroscedastic t asymptotic likelihood theory is discussed. In this thesis an integral approximation, the Laplace approximation, is presented and two examples, with the inclusion of ML for the heteroscedastic t, are discussed. A new approximate integral technique called Partial Laplace is also discussed and is exemplified with linear mixed models. Approximate marginal likelihood techniques using Modified Profile Likelihood (MPL), Conditional Profile Likelihood (CPL) and Stably Adjusted Profile Likelihood (SAPL) are also presented and offer an alternative to the approximate integration techniques. The asymptotic techniques are then applied to the heteroscedastic t when the degrees of freedom is known to form two distinct REMLs for the scale parameters. The first approximation uses the Partial Laplace approximation to form a REML for the scale parameters, whereas, the second uses the approximate marginal likelihood technique MPL. For each, the estimation of the location and scale parameters is discussed and computational algorithms are presented. For comparison, the heteroscedastic t for known degrees of freedom using ML and the two new REML equivalents are illustrated with an example and a comparative simulation study. The model is then extended to incorporate the estimation of the degrees of freedom parameter. The estimating equations for the location and scale parameters under ML are preserved and the estimation of the degrees of freedom parameter is integrated into the algorithm. The approximate REML techniques are also extended. For the Partial Laplace approximation the estimation of the degrees of freedom parameter is simultaneously estimated with the scale parameters and therefore the algorithm differs only slightly. The second approximation uses SAPL to estimate the parameters and produces approximate marginal likelihoods for the location, scale and degrees of freedom parameters. Computational algorithms for each of the techniques are also presented. Several extensive examples, as well as a comparative simulation study, are used to illustrate ML and the two REML equivalents for the heteroscedastic t with unknown degrees of freedom. The thesis is concluded with a discussion of the new techniques derived for the heteroscedastic t distribution along with their advantages and disadvantages. Topics of further research are also discussed. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] School of Agriculture and Wine, 2005...|$|R
