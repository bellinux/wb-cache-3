I am not here going into the distinctions of rights, nor {{attempting}} to mark their boundaries. I do not enter into these metaphysical distinctions; I hate the very sound of them. Leave the Americans as they anciently stood, and these distinctions, born of our unhappy contest, will die along with it... Be content to bind America by laws of trade; you have always done it... Do not burthen them with taxes... But if intemperately, unwisely, fatally, you sophisticate and poison the very source of government by urging subtle deductions, and consequences odious to those you govern, from the unlimited and illimitable nature of supreme sovereignty, you will teach them by these means to call that sovereignty itself in question... If that sovereignty and their freedom cannot be reconciled, which will they take? They will cast your sovereignty in your face. No body of <b>men</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> argued into slavery.|$|E
25|$|The first European {{trial of}} alleged Somali pirates {{opened in the}} Netherlands in May 2010. They were arrested in the Gulf of Aden in January 2009, when their {{high-speed}} boat was intercepted by a Danish frigate while allegedly preparing to board the cargo ship Samanyolu, which was registered in the Dutch Antilles. The pirates were sentenced {{to five years in}} prison, which was less than the maximum possible sentence. It is unlikely the <b>men</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> returned to Somalia after their sentence, as Somalia is considered too dangerous for deportation. One of the five has already applied for asylum in the Netherlands. Consequently, there are concerns that trials in European courts would encourage, rather than deter, pirates. However, trials are continuing in Europe. More recently in Paris, November 2011, five men were sentenced to between four and eight years; one man was acquitted. A trial also continues in Hamburg, Germany. In Italy, nine Somali pirates had been tried and sentenced to prison terms of 16 and 19 years. They had been found guilty of attempted kidnapping for extortion and illegal possession of firearms, in connection with 10 October 2011 attack and seizure of an Italian-owned cargo vessel, the Montecristo.|$|E

In the tale, Thórd and his servant get lost while traveling to church in winter, and so take shelter for the night within a cave. Inside the cave they hear noises, witness a pair of immense burning eyes, and then the being with burning eyes recites a poem of 12 stanzas. The poem the being recites contains references to Norse mythology (including a mention of Thor) and also prophecies (including that [...] "mountains will tumble, the earth will move, <b>men</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> scoured by hot water and burned by fire"). Surtr's fire receives a mention in stanza 10. John Lindow says that the poem may describe [...] "a mix {{of the destruction of}} the race of giants and of humans, as in Ragnarök" [...] but that [...] "many of the predictions of disruption on earth could also fit the volcanic activity that is so common in Iceland." ...|$|E

500|$|Authors, {{as well as}} Stationers, {{then joined}} the demand for {{a new system of}} licensing. Jonathan Swift was a strong {{advocate}} for licensing, and Daniel Defoe wrote on 8 November 1705 that with the absence of licensing, [...] "One Man Studies Seven Year, to bring a finish'd Peice into the World, and a Pyrate Printer, Reprints his Copy immediately, and Sells it for a quarter of the Price... these things call for an Act of Parliament". Seeing this, the Company took the opportunity to experiment with a change to their approach and argument. Instead of lobbying because of the effect the absence of legislation was having on their trade, they lobbied on behalf of the authors, but seeking the same things. The first indication of this change in approach comes from the 1706 pamphlet by John How, a stationer, titled Reasons humbly Offer'd for a Bill for the Encouragement of Learning and the Improvement of Printing. This argued for a return to licensing, not with reference to the printers, but because without something to protect authors and guarantee them an income, [...] "Learned <b>men</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> wholly discouraged from Propagating the most useful Parts of Knowledge and Literature". Using these new tactics and the support of authors, the Company petitioned Parliament again in both 1707 and 1709 to introduce a bill providing for copyright.|$|E
500|$|Shelley's {{writings}} {{focus on}} the role of the family in society and women's role within that family. She celebrates the [...] "feminine affections and compassion" [...] associated with the family and suggests that civil society will fail without them. Shelley was [...] "profoundly committed to an ethic of cooperation, mutual dependence, and self-sacrifice". In Lodore, for example, the central story follows the fortunes of the wife and daughter of the title character, Lord Lodore, who is killed in a duel at the end of the first volume, leaving a trail of legal, financial, and familial obstacles for the two [...] "heroines" [...] to negotiate. The novel is engaged with political and ideological issues, particularly the education and social role of women. [...] It dissects a patriarchal culture that separated the sexes and pressured women into dependence on men. In the view of Shelley scholar Betty T. Bennett, [...] "the novel proposes egalitarian educational paradigms for women and men, which would bring social justice as well as the spiritual and intellectual means by which to meet the challenges life invariably brings". However, Falkner is the only one of Mary Shelley's novels in which the heroine's agenda triumphs. The novel's resolution proposes that when female values triumph over violent and destructive masculinity, <b>men</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> freed to express the [...] "compassion, sympathy, and generosity" [...] of their better natures.|$|E
500|$|Several of the Olympian Gods—Artemis, Hades, Helios, Hermes, and Poseidon—decide {{to enter}} into a wager with Ares. Each will choose a {{champion}} who is in search of the Ambrosia, with the successful god receiving an award (e.g., having statues erected in their honor across Greece). Kratos kills two of the champions—Herodius and Pothia—and repels attacks by monsters sent by the gods to thwart him. A desperate Hades kills Nikos, who sacrifices himself to save Kratos, passing on the rank of Captain. Danaus is killed by Alrik, who retains Danaus' head to possess his magical ability. Kratos locates the [...] "Tree of Life", the source of the Ambrosia located on a small island, and confronts Cereyon. After being almost burned alive, Kratos drowns his foe and successfully retrieves the Ambrosia, but as he leaves, he and his Spartan troops are ambushed by Alrik's horde of barbarians. When Hades observes the Spartans defeating the Barbarians, the god attempts to have the Spartans dragged to the Underworld. Alrik uses the head of Danaus to summon rocs to attack Kratos as he flies away on a similar bird with the stolen Ambrosia. Kratos pursues Alrik on a captured roc, knowing that although his <b>men</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> taken to the Underworld, they will be honored in Sparta for their sacrifices. Alrik and Kratos battle, with Alrik critically wounding Kratos. The Spartan, however, is sprayed by the [...] Ambrosia [...] and subsequently healed.|$|E

500|$|The {{psychologist}} Kenneth Zucker and {{the psychiatrist}} Susan Bradley called Sexual Preference a [...] "classic study". Zucker and Bradley maintained that its data {{are consistent with}} those of previous clinical research, including Bieber et al.′s Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals (1962), with Bell et al.′s finding that [...] "detached-hostile father" [...] is relatively characteristic of a majority of the white homosexual men in their study and a minority of white heterosexual men being similar to what was reported by Bieber et al. Zucker and Bradley wrote that the psychoanalytic perspective that views homosexuality as a mental disorder and explains it in terms of family dynamics influenced the way in which Bell et al. conducted their inquiry, and that Sexual Preference must be understood in the context of sexual politics. They suggested that because homosexuality had been delisted as a mental disorder for eight years by the time the book was published, Bell et al. faced a problem if their data [...] "showed a departure from an ideal of optimal functioning in homosexual men". Zucker and Bradley argued that, because of their concern for homosexuals, and also influenced by political correctness, Bell et al. deliberately minimized the [...] "observed significant effects" [...] shown by their study, though they noted that this was also in part an objective interpretation of weak effects. Zucker and Bradley wrote that prior to Bell et al.′s study, researchers were aware that phenomena usually interpreted as parents influencing their children could be interpreted instead as the reverse, and that Bell et al. recognized that [...] "the direction of effects" [...] was a [...] "problematic aspect of their research design". In Zucker and Bradley′s view, resolving the [...] "direction-of-effects issue" [...] raised by Bell et al. through retrospective studies comparing homosexual with heterosexual <b>men</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> difficult, and that until then the issue will remain [...] "a matter of theoretical taste." ...|$|E

2500|$|When matters quieted down, Frank Grouard and [...] asked American Horse {{again if}} they {{would come out of}} the hole before any more were shot, telling them they would be safe if they surrendered. “After a few minutes deliberation, the chief, American Horse, a fine looking, broad-chested Sioux, with a {{handsome}} face and a neck like a bull, showed himself {{at the mouth of the}} cave, presenting the butt end of his rifle toward the General. He had just been shot in the abdomen, and said in his native language, that he would yield if the lives of the warriors who fought with him were spared. Chief American Horse had been shot through the bowels and was holding his entrails in his hands as he came out and presented the butt end of his rifle to General Crook. [...] Pourier recalled that he first saw American Horse kneeling with a gun in his hand, in a hole on the side of the ravine that he had scooped out with a butcher knife. Two of the squaws were also wounded. [...] Eleven were killed in the hole. Grouard recognized Chief American Horse, “but you would not have thought he was shot from his appearance and his looks, except for the paleness of his face. [...] He came marching out of that death trap as straight as an arrow. [...] Holding out one of his blood-stained hands he shook hands with me.” [...] When Chief American Horse presented the butt end of his rifle, General Crook, who took the proffered rifle, instructed Grouard to ask his name. [...] The Indian replied in Lakota, “American Horse.” [...] Some of the soldiers who lost their comrades in the skirmish shouted, “No quarter!’, but not a man was base enough to attempt shooting down the disabled chief. Crook hesitated for a minute and then said,‘Two or three Sioux, more or less, can make no difference. [...] I can yet use them to good advantage. [...] "Tell the chief,“ he said turning to Grouard, [...] "that neither he nor his young <b>men</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> harmed further.” [...] “This message having been interpreted to Chief American Horse, he beckoned to his surviving followers, and two strapping Indians, with their long, but quick and graceful stride, followed him out of the gully. [...] The chieftain’s intestines protruded from his wound, but a squaw, his wife perhaps, tied her shawl around the injured part, and then the poor, fearless savage, never uttering a complaint, walked slowly to a little camp fire, occupied by his people about 20 yards away, and sat down among the women and children.” ...|$|E
