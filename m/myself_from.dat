5|$|These were {{difficulties}} {{which seemed}} rather {{to require the}} superior force of a Wycherley, or a Congreve, than of a raw and unexperienced pen; for I believe I may boast that none ever appeared so early upon the stage. However, such was the candour of the audience, the play was received with greater satisfaction than I should have promised <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> its merit, had it even preceded the Provoked Husband.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} I {{was part of}} what is now known as the {{emerging}} church and spent some time traveling the country to speak on the emerging church in the emerging culture on a team put together by Leadership Network called the Young Leader Network. But, I eventually had to distance <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> the emergent stream of the network because friends like Brian McLaren and Doug Pagitt began pushing a theological agenda that greatly troubled me. Examples include referring to God as a chick, questioning God's sovereignty over and knowledge of the future, denial of the substitutionary atonement at the cross, a low view of Scripture, and denial of hell which is one hell of a mistake.|$|E

She said [...] "I guess it was my rebellious phase. It wasn't really for me. I kind of smartened up and tried to distance <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> that." [...] As of May 2016, Khalifa was still performing as a webcam model.|$|E

The play was later quoted in The Beauties of Fielding {{more than any of}} Fielding's other plays, according to Thomas Lockwood, [...] "because for anthology reading purposes it supplied far more extractably witty bits than other Fielding plays more representative or still holding the stage." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of The Slim Shady LP, Eminem went from an {{underground}} rapper into a high-profile celebrity. Interscope Records awarded him with his own record label, Shady Records; the first artist Eminem signed was rapper and his best friend Proof. [...] Eminem, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle: [...] "This last Christmas, {{there were so many}} fucking presents under the tree... My daughter wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth. But she's got one now. I can't stop <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> spoiling her." ...|$|E
500|$|I think I should {{rephrase}} <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> {{my previous}} letters when I {{was talking about}} taking a 'break'. What I meant was I am {{taking a break from}} being told what to do. ... It's cool when you look at someone and don't know whether they are at work or play since it's all the same to them. The things I've been doing for work lately have been so much fun, because it's not like work to me anymore. I've been even more 'hands on' in my management and the business side of things, and I feel more in control than ever.|$|E

500|$|The police raided Manchester's Irish {{quarters}} and brought [...] "dozens of suspects, selected almost at random", before local magistrates; the raids {{have been described}} as a [...] "reign of terror" [...] for the Irish in Manchester. Amongst those arrested was Thomas Maguire, a young Royal Marine on leave, who unfortunately for him had been {{in the vicinity of the}} attack on the police van and was Irish. Such was the zeal of the police that one man with a strong Irish accent surrendered himself to the magistrates [...] "as the only means I have of saving <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> being arrested over and over again wherever I go, as a Fenian".|$|E
500|$|She {{explained}} that [...] "i cant separate <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> others ... i feel connected to everybody ... {{like they were}} distant family," [...] and cited Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman and Elie Wiesel. She said she hoped the material would lead to [...] "hopefully worldwide discussion, debates, and reforms. if not ... than [...] we're doomed as a species." [...] She said she had downloaded the material onto music CD-RWs, erased the music {{and replaced it with}} a compressed split file. Part of the reason no one noticed, she said, was that staff were working 14 hours a day, seven days a week, and [...] "people stopped caring after 3 weeks." ...|$|E
500|$|Godse, whose {{character}} is a failed model, has a carefree look. Dhody said, [...] "Godse's look in the film is a fusion of rock and a grunge {{to give her the}} survivor look as a B-grade model, making her more chic and glamorous." [...] She wears low-waisted trousers, chains and ankle boots. Details of jewellery, clothes, colour and accessories outline the characters; everything had to be sychronised and complement each other to create an authentic look. Dhody said, [...] "We didn't try to sensationalise it by making it more bling- or costume-based. I had to restrain <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> going overboard due to Bhandarkar's reservations". The film's narrative included 11 character-based ramp shows.|$|E

500|$|Banks was {{a lifelong}} Republican – {{and he also}} once stated that [...] "I'm not goin' {{anywhere}} I'm not wanted" [...] – prompting critics to claim that he was [...] "soft" [...] on Jim Crow; he ran for alderman in Chicago in 1963. He lost the election and later said, [...] "People knew me only as a baseball player. They didn't think I qualified as a government official {{and no matter what}} I did I couldn't change my image...What I learned, was {{that it was going to}} be hard for me to disengage <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> my baseball life and I would have to compensate for it after my playing days were over."

500|$|Smith {{declared}} that [...] "Big Hoops (Bigger the Better)" [...] was not originally {{intended as a}} single, only [...] "a big club banger", as he and Furtado felt the track's status as [...] "a song {{that would be the}} best of Nelly, Nelly’s attitude, Nelly’s freshness" [...] would not be [...] "really about chart positions". Eventually it became the lead single for The Spirit Indestructible. Furtado stated that the song earned this status because it represented her intentions [...] "to detach <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> all shackles and play freely" [...] as her ambitious younger self was always [...] "pushing the boundaries". It was released via digital download on April 17, 2012, and was released physically in Germany on May 18, 2012.|$|E
500|$|.....as soon as I got out I {{climbed on}} to the railing and threw myself out to the wire-netting, a {{distance}} of between 20 and 30 feet. The idea in my mind was [...] "one big tragedy may save many others". I realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was the iron staircase. When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> the top, as I meant, {{on to the}} iron staircase. If I had been successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, {{as it was a}} clear drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught {{on the edge of the}} netting. I then threw myself forward on my head with all my might.|$|E

500|$|During 2004, Ben Affleck shot a cameo {{role for}} the {{spin-off}} film, Elektra, {{at the request of}} Daredevil co-star Jennifer Garner. In October 2004, Affleck stated he would only return in the lead role if Fox would renegotiate to tell the darker stories of Daredevil, and showed interest in a Kevin Smith graphic novel which included Mysterio, as well as the Born Again storyline. However, in November 2006, Affleck stated that he would never reprise the role, having felt [...] "by playing a superhero in Daredevil, I have inoculated <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> ever playing another superhero... Wearing a costume was a source of humiliation for me and something I wouldn't want to do again soon." [...] Despite this, Affleck would later sign on to portray the DC superhero, Bruce Wayne / Batman, in [...]|$|E
500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. And I guess that is a strange way to feel about a song you wrote, so yeah, I am happy to not have to do it these days".|$|E
500|$|As in Land of the Soviets, where Hergé had {{based his}} {{information}} about the Soviet Union almost entirely on a single source, in Tintin in the Congo he used limited source material {{to learn about the}} country and its people. He based the story largely on literature written by missionaries, with the only added element being that of the diamond smugglers, possibly adopted from the [...] "Jungle Jim-type serials". Hergé visited the Colonial Museum of Tervuren, examining their ethnographic collections of Congolese artefacts, including costumes of the Leopard Men. He adopted hunting scenes from André Maurois's novel The Silence of Colonel Bramble, while his animal drawings were inspired by Benjamin Rabier's prints. He also listened to tales of the colony from some of his colleagues who had been there, but disliked their stories, later claiming: [...] "I didn't like the colonists, who came back bragging about their exploits. But I couldn't prevent <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> seeing the Blacks as big children, either." ...|$|E

500|$|Danny Elfman {{had great}} enthusiasm for {{returning}} because [...] "I didn't {{have to prove}} <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> the first film. I remember Jon Peters was very skeptical at first to hire me." [...] Elfman's work schedule was 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. [...] "When completing this movie I realized it {{was something of a}} film score and an opera. It was 95 minutes long, twice the amount of the average film score." [...] Burton allowed Elfman to be more artistic with the sequel score, such as the [...] "scraping" [...] on violins for the cat themes. Under the pressure of finishing the score, however, {{the relationship between the two}} strained, which — along with further [...] "creative differences" [...] on The Nightmare Before Christmas — led Burton to use Howard Shore to score his next film Ed Wood. The musician co-orchestrated [...] "Face to Face", which was written and performed by Siouxsie and the Banshees. The song can be heard in one scene during the film and during the end credits.|$|E
500|$|Plath's semi-autobiographical novel, {{which her}} mother wished to block, was {{published}} in 1963 and in the US in 1971. Describing the compilation of the book to her mother, she wrote, [...] "What I've done is to throw together events from my own life, fictionalising to add colour– it's a pot boiler really, but I think it will show how isolated a person feels when he is suffering a breakdown.... I've tried to picture my world {{and the people in}} it as seen through the distorting lens of a bell jar". She described her novel as [...] "an autobiographical apprentice work which I had to write in order to free <b>myself</b> <b>from</b> the past". She dated a Yale senior named Dick Norton during her junior year. Norton, upon whom the character of Buddy in The Bell Jar is based, contracted tuberculosis and was treated at the Ray Brook Sanatorium near Saranac Lake. While visiting Norton, Plath broke her leg skiing, an incident that was fictionalized in the novel. Plath also used the novel to highlight the issue of women in the workforce during the 1950s. She strongly believed in their abilities to be writers and editors, while society forced them to fulfill secretarial roles.|$|E
