5|$|While {{playing for}} the local youth team of San Vendemiano, Del Piero used to feature as a goalkeeper, {{in order to gain}} more playing time. His <b>mother</b> <b>thought</b> {{it would be better for}} him to play in this role as he would not sweat, and the {{possibility}} of him getting injured was less likely. His brother Stefano commented to their mother that, due to his skill, Alessandro was more suited to playing in a more offensive position, and Del Piero switched to a forward role.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Caskey {{was born}} Clara Elizabeth Conningsby Gwyn on 20 May 1910 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. She {{was the third}} child of seven {{children}} (four girls and three boys) of Stratton Gwyn and Fanny Coningsby. She spent her early years in the prairies of Canada under difficult conditions. She attended elementary school at Dandas until 1921. From 1922 her high school education was at the Battleford Collegiate School at Battleford. She was a good debater in the school, and graduated from the school with distinction, getting the Governor General's Medal for Saskatchewan. From 1926 to 1927 she stayed at home learning piano as her <b>mother</b> <b>thought</b> she {{was too young to}} go to college.|$|E
5|$|When Richard {{was five}} years old, his mother {{gave birth to a}} younger brother, Henry Philips, who died at four weeks of age on February 25, 1924. Four years later, Richard's sister Joan was born, and the family moved to Far Rockaway, Queens. Though {{separated}} by nine years, Joan and Richard were close, as they both shared a natural curiosity about the world. Their <b>mother</b> <b>thought</b> that women did not have the cranial capacity to comprehend such things. Despite their mother's disapproval of Joan's desire to study astronomy, Richard encouraged his sister to explore the universe. Joan eventually became an astrophysicist specializing in interactions between the Earth and the solar wind.|$|E

5|$|Félix Trinidad {{was born}} in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, to a Puerto Rican family. During his {{childhood}} {{the family moved to}} Cupey Alto, a subdivision of San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he grew up. His future wife, Sharon Santiago, lived in Cupey and first met Trinidad in the home of her neighborhood friend, a classmate of Trinidad's. Trinidad pursued a relationship with Santiago, including an attempt to impress her with his red Ford Mustang. He continued to press for her affection and, with the help of Santiago's neighbor, Trinidad was able to win her over. Early on, Santiago's <b>mother</b> <b>thought</b> that Trinidad was related to her daughter's friend, but she realized the true situation when she visited the friend's house and he acted nervous in her presence. Santiago's father objected to the relationship because Trinidad was an athlete; at the time many athletes had a negative public image. Santiago became rebellious, but Trinidad eventually won her family's trust. The couple was married four years after they began dating and have had four daughters. Trinidad has a fifth daughter, named Alondra Nicole, from another relationship.|$|E

25|$|Williams {{lived in}} San Diego's North Park {{neighborhood}} (4121 Utah Street). At {{the age of}} eight, he was taught how to throw a baseball by his uncle, Saul Venzor. Saul {{was one of his}} mother's four brothers, as well as a former semi-professional baseball player who had pitched against Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Joe Gordon in an exhibition game. As a child, Williams' heroes were Pepper Martin of the St. Louis Cardinals and Bill Terry of the New York Giants. Williams graduated from Herbert Hoover High School in San Diego, where he played baseball as a pitcher and was the star of the team. Though he had offers from the St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Yankees while he was still in high school, his <b>mother</b> <b>thought</b> he was too young to leave home, so he signed up with the local minor league club, the San Diego Padres.|$|E
25|$|I {{regret to}} say {{that none of us}} {{approved}} of the marriage at that time. <b>Mother</b> <b>thought</b> Jack was too young, and Lottie and I felt that Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which was not at all surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes I have ever seen. They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor of her skin. I could understand why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from the Follies. She and Jack were madly in love with one another but I always thought of them as a couple of children playing together.|$|E

Each summer, Hextall received training at the hockey school at which his father taught, but the hockey programs in Pittsburgh and Atlanta were sub-standard, and meant that during his teenage years, he was behind many of his fellow players.

[...] Actor Leslie Grantham has stated that Dot is the [...] "one friend in [...] life", while series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: [...] "Dot’s always going to forgive him. And that’s the beauty of Nick and Dot." [...] Concurring with this sentiment, John Altman (Nick) agreed: [...] "No matter what he does, she’ll forgive him.

Vonnegut commented that Robert Louis Stevenson's stories were emblems of thoughtfully put together works {{that he tried to}} mimic in his own compositions. Vonnegut also hailed playwright and socialist George Bernard Shaw as [...] "a hero of [...] ", and an [...] "enormous influence." [...] Within his own family, Vonnegut stated that his mother, Edith, had the greatest influence on him.

One such break-up occurred after Charlene's <b>mother</b> <b>thought</b> she should date other boys, while Scott had to repeat his final year of school without her. Scott was initially unsure how to win Charlene back, but after speaking with his grandmother, Helen (Anne Haddy), who mentioned that her husband gave her a friendship ring, Scott {{went out and bought}} one for Charlene. While they were enjoying a barbecue at Charlene's caravan by Lassiter's lake, the couple argued about Charlene spending time with Warren Murphy (Ben Mendelsohn) and Scott decided to leave. When Charlene started to go after Scott, she found herself trapped by a fire that had been accidentally started by Greg Davis (Alex Papps). Greg had been storing petrol under the caravan and spilled it as he was removing the cans, causing the petrol to head towards the still burning barbecue. Scott rescued [...] "a terrified" [...] Charlene from the flames, but an explosion threw them both to the ground and Charlene was knocked unconscious.|$|E

If the mother is distressed by the pregnancy, especially if she considers abortion, the child responds with distress and anger that continue through postnatal life. If the child is separated from the mother after birth, no matter how early this occurs, the child again feels distress and rage that will block attachment to a foster or adoptive caregiver.|$|R
500|$|As a {{teenager}} David enjoyed painting, and her <b>mother</b> <b>thought</b> her talent worth developing. She {{was sent to}} Paris in 1930, studying painting privately and enrolling at the Sorbonne for a course in French civilisation which covered history, literature and architecture. She found her Sorbonne studies arduous {{and in many ways}} uninspiring, but they left her with a love of French literature and a fluency in the language that remained with her throughout her life. She lodged with a Parisian family, whose fanatical devotion to the pleasures of the table she portrayed to comic effect in her French Provincial Cooking (1960). Nevertheless, she acknowledged in retrospect that the experience had been the most valuable part of her time in Paris: [...] "I realized in what way the family had fulfilled their task of instilling French culture into at least one of their British charges. Forgotten were the Sorbonne professors.... What had stuck was the taste for a kind of food quite ideally unlike anything I had known before." [...] Stella Gwynne was not eager for her daughter's early return to England after qualifying for her Sorbonne diploma, and sent her from Paris to Munich in 1931 to study German.|$|E

2500|$|While Mansfield Park {{was ignored}} by reviewers at first publication, {{it was a}} great success with the public. The first {{printing}} [...] "sold out within six months" [...] and in 1816 she had a second printing which also sold out. Austen's earnings on this novel were larger than for any of her other novels published in her lifetime. This novel received its first positive critical review in 1821, in a review of all of Jane Austen's published novels by Richard Whately, who specifically noted the character of Fanny Price. Regency critics praised the novel's wholesome morality; Jane Austen's <b>mother</b> <b>thought</b> Fanny [...] "insipid", though other unpublished private reviewers liked the character, as Jane Austen collected comments by those in her social circle about Fanny Price.|$|E

2500|$|Jack Churchill, born in 1880, {{became an}} army officer {{and served with}} {{distinction}} in the Boer War, after which he returned to civilian life, having been found a position as a stockbroker by the financier Sir Ernest Cassel. At the time this was considered an unsuitable career for a gentleman, and in 1907 his proposed marriage to the [...] "vivacious" [...] Lady Gwendoline had to be postponed because her <b>mother</b> <b>thought</b> him too poor. Though self-effacing and inoffensive, {{a good deal of}} unfounded rumour attached to him as a young man (as it did to much of the Churchill clan, although in some cases for better reason): among other things, it was suggested that his natural father was the fifth Earl of Roden (or, less plausibly, the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador to Britain, Count Karl Kinsky) and that he had murdered Lord Percy, heir to the Duke of Northumberland, who had died in mysterious circumstances in 1909 and was whispered to have been the lover of Clementine Hozier, whom Winston Churchill married in 1908. It appears also that Winston had proposed marriage to Lady Gwendoline, who had turned him down in favour of his brother. In the 1920s, the mere fact that his brother was a stockbroker caused some awkwardness when Winston was Chancellor of the Exchequer. Jack Churchill fought again in the First World War and was awarded both the Croix de Guerre and the Légion d'Honneur.|$|E

Co-star Charlie Clements (Bradley Branning) has stated: [...] "You think of soap bad guys, Nick Cotton is definitely up there with the best of them", while Leslie Grantham (Den Watts) opined that [...] "There is no redeeming feature about Nick Cotton whatsoever". This assessment is shared by series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who has explained: [...] "It's good to have an out and out villain. I think sometimes you can get a character and go 'Oh, they should have a good side as well, and maybe we should redeem them a little bit.' With Nick, it doesn’t matter. You can go full pelt, foot-on-the-accelerator bad guy." [...] John Altman has discussed the fact that he cannot remember his character ever once being nice, blaming Nick's unruliness on his father's absence during his childhood. Santer has discussed the [...] "wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship" [...] Nick shares with his mother, Dot Cotton, and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance, regardless of his history of wrongdoing.
