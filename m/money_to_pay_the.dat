According to drummer Dafydd Ieuan the band didn't have the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> artists involved for these remixes so, {{in order to provide}} them with royalties, promised to release an album featuring the tracks on their own label.|$|E
5|$|Wyn died in 1967, and {{the company}} grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed {{contracts}} to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later {{found out that the}} author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} bidding, TETCO raised the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> {{government}} {{through a combination}} of bonds and share issues. A further government enquiry was required before the sale was allowed to go through, which was complicated by the reluctance of the state of Pennsylvania to allow the pipelines to be used to pump gas east through its territory. The government of Pennsylvania was influenced by the coal industry, who feared they would lose sales, but it eventually relented and the sale of the pipelines to TETCO was finally completed on November 1. The value of the company soared, and the original investors saw the value of their holdings increase 63-fold.|$|E

5|$|The {{estimation}} that 300 senators were proscribed {{was presented}} by Appian, although his earlier contemporary Livy asserted that only 130 senators had been proscribed. This decree {{issued by the}} triumvirate was motivated {{in part by a}} need to raise <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> salaries of their troops for the upcoming conflict against Caesar's assassins, Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger and Gaius Cassius Longinus. Rewards for their arrest gave incentive for Romans to capture those proscribed, while the assets and properties of those arrested were seized by the triumvirs.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the {{brothers}} started Ashby Computers and Graphics in the Leicestershire town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch with Lathbury and Tim's girlfriend, Carole Ward, whom he later married in 1985. They {{worked out of}} a four-room row house next-door to {{the brothers}}' family corner store and ran on a shoestring budget for its first six months, in which they pooled their <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> bills. The company did not credit individuals on their releases, though they had individual roles in development: Chris and Lathbury programmed and Tim and Carole designed the graphics. Carole also served as the company's secretary. Ultimate Play the Game, as the company was publicly known, first licensed arcade cabinet conversion kits to companies {{before moving to the}} more profitable British home computer market.|$|E

The sound of a military band is heard, and the friends leave. Alcindoro returns with the repaired shoe seeking Musetta.

25|$|In 843/4, the Caliph—allegedly at the {{instigation}} of the vizier Ibn al-Zayyat, or {{according to}} a story reported by al-Tabari, inspired by {{the downfall of the}} Barmakids under Harun al-Rashid—arrested, tortured, and imposed heavy fines on several of the secretaries in the central government, in an effort to raise <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> Turkish troops, {{and at the same time}} reduce the power of the leading Turkish commanders, such as Itakh and Ashinas, since most of the secretaries arrested and forced to pay were in their service.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, Bob Kleberg, Jr., {{the son of}} Bob Kleberg, Sr. and Alice Gertrudis King, leased the {{exploration}} and drilling rights on the ranch to Humble Oil of Houston, Texas for $127,824, {{in exchange for the}} usual royalty of 1/8 of every barrel (20 L) of oil pumped from the property. Humble Oil loaned enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> debts of the H.M. King estate, secured by a first mortgage on the land. Humble struck oil and gas by 1939. During all of this, the Ranch was a going concern, with a net profit of $227,382, as early as 1926.|$|E

25|$|John Stansbury {{took over}} a school whose numbers were declining rapidly. Numbers were down from 150 {{at the end of}} 1976 to 102 and dwindled still further {{in the course of the}} year. Boys from Zambia and Malawi were being {{withdrawn}} as a result of the security situation and by 1979, economic sanctions meant that parents were not permitted to transfer <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> school fees. Others were finding places in schools closer to Harare. Despite his dedicated efforts to recruit new pupils, the head was in the unenviable position of having to reduce staff numbers as the school scaled down.|$|E
25|$|When {{he first}} pitched {{the idea of}} Pokémon to Nintendo, they could not quite grasp the concept, but were {{impressed}} enough with Tajiri's game design reputation that they decided to explore the concept. Shigeru Miyamoto began to mentor Tajiri, guiding him during the creation process. Pokémon Red and Blue took six years to produce, and nearly bankrupted Game Freak in the process; often, there was barely enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> employees. Five employees quit, and Tajiri did not take a salary, instead living off of his father's income. Investment from Creatures Inc. allowed Game Freak to complete the games, and in return, Creatures received one-third of the franchise rights.|$|E
25|$|According to Ammianus, Serenianus stayed {{loyal to}} Valens. That year Serenianus went to Cyzicus, {{where he found}} that an {{imperial}} officer called Venustus had brought in that city, for fear of the usurper, the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> troops; Serenianus, confident in the city garrison and in {{the strength of the}} city walls, fortified in Cizycus. To obtain that money, Procopius collected a strong army and put under siege Cyzicus, capturing the city and Serenianus, who was sent, as a prisoner, to Nicaea. After Procopius was killed, Marcellus, who was in command of the garrison of Nicaea, during the night entered the Palace, where Serenianus was held, and killed him.|$|E

25|$|In 1372 the English monarch Edward III planned an {{important}} campaign in Aquitaine under the newly appointed lieutenant of the Duchy, the Earl of Pembroke. He contracted {{to serve a}} year in the duchy with a retinue of 24 knights 55 squires and 80 archers besides another companies led by Sir Hugh Calveley and Sir John Devereux, who finally did not serve or did not appear. Pembroke received instructions to recruit a host of 500 knight, 1,500 squires and 1,500 archers after his arrival in France. One of Edward's clerks, John Wilton, was appointed to accompany the Earl with a large amount of <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> troops.|$|E
25|$|The crusade went badly {{from the}} start – Theobald died in 1201 and the army that arrived at Venice {{in the summer of}} 1202 was one third the size that had been {{anticipated}} (4,500 knights, 9,000 squires, 20,000 men at-arms expected). Consequently, there was not enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> Venetians, whose fleet was hired by the crusaders to take them to Egypt. Venetian policy under the aging and blind but still ambitious Doge Enrico Dandolo was potentially at variance with that of the Pope and the crusaders, because Venice was closely related commercially with Egypt.). At the time, Venetian envoys were discussing trade terms with the Egyptians – but {{in the end it was}} decided that such discussions would have allowed them to deceive the Egyptians.|$|E
25|$|Land revenue {{settlements}} {{constituted a}} major administrative {{activity of the}} various governments in India under Company rule. In all areas other than the Bengal Presidency, land settlement work involved a continually repetitive process of surveying and measuring plots, assessing their quality, and recording landed rights, and constituted {{a large proportion of}} the work of Indian Civil Service officers working for the government. After the Company lost its trading rights, it became the single most important source of government revenue, roughly half of overall revenue in the middle of the 19th century; even so, between the years 1814 and 1859, the government of India ran debts in 33 years. With expanded dominion, even during non-deficit years, there was just enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> salaries of a threadbare administration, a skeleton police force, and the army.|$|E

25|$|Many of Muhammad's companions {{asked for}} Fatimah's hand in marriage, {{including}} Abu Bakr and Umar. Muhammad turned them all down, {{saying that he}} was awaiting a sign of her destiny. Ali, Muhammad's cousin, also had a desire to marry Fatimah. When he went to see Muhammad, he could not vocalise his intention but remained silent. Muhammad understood the reason for his being there and prompted Ali to confirm that he had come to seek Fatimah in marriage. He suggested that Ali had a shield, which if sold, would provide sufficient <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> bridal gift (mahr). Muhammad put forward the proposal from Ali to Fatimah, who remained silent and did not reject the proposal like the previous ones. Muhammad took this to be a sign of affirmation and consent.|$|E
25|$|Returning home, {{he found}} western Pennsylvanians (mostly Scotch Irish) {{angry at the}} liquor tax imposed in 1791 by Congress at the demand of Alexander Hamilton to raise <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> {{national}} debt. Farmers could only export whiskey because transportation costs were too high for grain. Although Gallatin had opposed the tax before it was passed and attended numerous protest meetings, he counseled moderation. Nevertheless, the role {{he played in the}} Whiskey Rebellion in the early 1790s proved a lasting political liability, as President George Washington denounced the tax protesters, called out the militia, and marched {{at the head of the}} army for a portion of their way to put down the rebellion. A group of radicals, headed by a lawyer named David Bradford, staged incendiary meetings, to which they summoned the local militia, terrorized conservatives in Pittsburgh, threatened federal revenue officers with death, and called for rebellion.|$|E
25|$|Peru is {{investigating}} claims that a beauty pageant contestant was lured to Gabon {{to become the}} lover of its 67-year-old president, Omar Bongo, and was stranded for nearly two weeks after she refused. A spokesman for Mr. Bongo said {{he was unaware of}} the allegations. The Peruvian Foreign Ministry said that Ivette Santa Maria, a 22-year-old Miss Peru America contestant, was invited to Gabon to be a hostess for a pageant there. In an interview, Ms. Santa Maria said that she was taken to Mr. Bongo's presidential palace hours after her Jan. 19 arrival and that as he joined her, he pressed a button and some sliding doors opened, revealing a large bed. She said, I told him I was not a prostitute, that I was a Miss Peru. She fled and guards offered to drive her to a hotel. Without <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> bill, however, she was stranded in Gabon for 12 days until international women's groups and others intervened.|$|E
