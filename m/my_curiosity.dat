"I {{wanted to}} learn about Christ– about the Old Testament, which had been his Bible, and the New Testament, which was the Bible about him; {{about the history of}} the church, which had been founded on the faith that through him God had not only {{revealed}} his innermost nature and his purpose for the world, but had released into the world a fierce power to draw people into that nature and adapt them to that purpose... No intellectual pursuit had ever aroused in me such intense curiosity, and much more than my intellect was involved, much more than <b>my</b> <b>curiosity</b> aroused. In the unfamiliar setting of a Presbyterian church, of all places, I had been moved to astonished tears which came from so deep inside me that to this day I have never fathomed them, I {{wanted to learn}} more about the source of those tears and the object of that astonishment." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{stood up}} beside him and looked out. I was a little flushed, my ears a little reddened, by the {{inconvenience}} of <b>my</b> <b>curiosities,</b> and by <b>my</b> uneasy sense of profound moral differences. He was taller than I. [...] .|$|R

60|$|I {{came back}} and sat down, for <b>my</b> <b>curiosity,</b> a great failing with me, was excited.|$|E
60|$|I {{had almost}} {{forgotten}} that enigmatical message of Poirot's, but now <b>my</b> <b>curiosity</b> was aroused afresh.|$|E
60|$|This time, <b>my</b> {{harmless}} <b>curiosity</b> {{could be}} gratified by a reply expressed in three words--nothing had happened.|$|R
60|$|After a while, {{the first}} {{sense of relief}} passes away. <b>My</b> dormant <b>curiosity</b> revives. I begin to look about me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish, captain, {{you would}} do me the favour to step into our state-room, some morning; I have many curious things I should like to show you. A set of razors, in particular,--and a dressing-case--and a pair of patent pistols--and that {{life-preserver}} that you admire so much, Mr. Dodge.

60|$|Poirot nodded absently. He seemed {{absorbed in}} thought; {{so much so}} that <b>my</b> <b>curiosity</b> was aroused.|$|E

60|$|When I {{revisited}} the garret {{and saw the}} old blue {{chest in}} the same dusty corner, <b>my</b> childish <b>curiosity</b> revived and I begged Aunt Winnifred to tell me its history.|$|R
60|$|Well, <b>my</b> own <b>curiosity</b> helped me. I cut the cord, {{threw open}} the lid, and looked in. He kept his eyes turned away, {{as if he were}} frightened to look for himself.|$|R

My family, friends, mentors, and colleagues, have been invaluable assets to my personal and intellectual growth. I would like to thank first my advisor, Dana Cloud.
