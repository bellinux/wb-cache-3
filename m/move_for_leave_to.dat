25|$|February 22, 2008: Monroe County announces its {{intention}} to <b>move</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> appeal the Martinez decision to the Court of Appeals.|$|E
25|$|In February 2008, the Appellate Division, Fourth Department {{ruled that}} a {{same-sex}} marriage consummated in Canada should be recognized in New York. In Martinez v. County of Monroe, the court reasoned that because out-of-state opposite-sex marriages {{that would not have}} been legal in New York nonetheless are recognized unless such recognition would violate the public policy of the state, out-of-state same-sex marriages must be similarly recognized. The Appellate Division reversed a trial judge's ruling in 2006 that Monroe Community College did not have to extend health benefits to an employee's same-sex spouse. Monroe County subsequently announced its intention to <b>move</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals, New York State's highest courts. However, the Court of Appeals refused to hear the case on May 6, 2008, allowing the lower court's ruling to stand. In November 2008, Monroe County announced that it would not pursue any further appeals of the Appellate Division's decision.|$|E
6000|$|Sir, I <b>move</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> {{bring in}} a bill, [...] "For the better {{regulation}} of his Majesty's civil establishments, and of certain public offices; for the limitation of pensions, and the suppression of sundry useless, expensive, and inconvenient places, and for applying the moneys saved thereby to the public service."[47] ...|$|E
50|$|When, on 1 March 1831, Lord John Russell <b>moved</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> {{bring in}} the first Reform Bill, Sebright, as an {{independent}} member, seconded the motion; and supported this and the succeeding reform bills. On 17 December 1832 he was returned for Hertfordshire, {{at the head of}} the poll, to the first reformed parliament, but retired at its close.|$|R
5000|$|On March 7, 2017, the State of Hawaii {{brought a}} civil action {{challenging}} the executive order, asking for declaratory judgment and an injunction halting the order. The State of Hawaii <b>moved</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> file an Amended Complaint pertaining to Executive Order 13780. Doug Chin, Hawaii’s attorney general, publicly stated, [...] "This new executive order {{is nothing more}} than Muslim Ban 2.0. Under the pretense of national security, it still targets immigrants and refugees. It leaves the door open for even further restrictions.” Hawaii’s legal challenge to the revised ban cites top White House advisor Stephen Miller as saying the revised travel ban is meant to achieve the same basic policy outcome as the original.|$|R
5000|$|Nugent was {{an extreme}} Whig, or a whig-radical, in politics. He {{was a strong}} {{supporter}} of Queen Caroline of Brunswick, and he visited Spain as a partisan of the Spanish Liberals against the Carlists. In the session of 1848 Nugent <b>moved</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> bring in a bill abolishing the separate imprisonment in gaols of persons committed for trial, but the motion was lost. During the same session he advocated the abolition of capital punishment. In 1849 he voted for limiting the powers of the Habeas Corpus (Ireland) Suspension Bill, and also supported a measure for the further repeal of Penal Laws. He {{was a member of the}} Reform Club and the Athenaeum Club.|$|R
6000|$|Upon all which, {{and many}} other reasons of equal weight, though not equally curious, I do here gladly embrace an {{opportunity}} I have long sought for, of recommending it as a very noble undertaking to Sir Edward Seymour, Sir Christopher Musgrave, Sir John Bowles, John Howe, Esq., and other patriots concerned, that they would <b>move</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> bring in a Bill for appointing commissioners to inspect into Bedlam and the parts adjacent, who shall be empowered to send for persons, papers, and records, to examine into the merits and qualifications of every student and professor, to observe with utmost exactness their several dispositions and behaviour, by which means, duly distinguishing and adapting their talents, they might produce admirable instruments for the several offices in a state, [...] . civil and military, proceeding in such methods as I shall here humbly propose. And I hope the gentle reader will give some allowance to my great solicitudes in this important affair, upon account of that high esteem I have ever borne that honourable society, whereof I had some time the happiness to be an unworthy member.|$|E

50|$|Members {{may give}} notice of Bills. In the first {{instance}} the Members should give 30 days notice of their intention to <b>move</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> introduce a Bill and send {{a copy of the}} Bill together with a statement of objects and reasons. An intimation will be sent to the concerned Member if the Bill requires the recommendation of the Governor for introduction or for its consideration. It {{is the responsibility of the}} Member-in-Charge to obtain Governor's recommendation and annex to the notice.|$|E
50|$|On 16 March 1821 Canning {{spoke in}} favour of William Plunket's Catholic Emancipation Bill. Liverpool wished to have Canning back in the Cabinet but the King was {{strongly}} hostile to him due to his actions over the Caroline affair. The King would only allow Canning back into the Cabinet {{if he did not}} have to deal personally with him. This required the office of Governor-General of India. After deliberating on whether to accept, Canning initially declined the offer but then accepted it. On 25 April he spoke in the Commons against Lord John Russell's motion for parliamentary reform and a few days later Canning <b>moved</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> introduce a measure of Catholic Emancipation (for lifting the exclusion of Catholics from the House of Lords). This passed the Commons but was rejected by the Lords.|$|R

50|$|The {{active part}} which Newton had taken in {{defending}} the legal privileges {{of the university}} against the encroachments of the crown had probably at least equal weight with his scientific reputation when his friends chose him {{as a candidate for}} a seat in parliament as one of the representatives of the university. The other candidates were Sir Robert Sawyer and Mr Finch. Sir Robert headed the poll with 125 votes, Newton next with 122 and Mr Finch was last with 117 votes. Newton retained his seat only about a year, from January 1689 till the dissolution of the Coventry Parliament in February 1690. During this time Newton {{does not appear to have}} taken part in any of the debates in the House, but he was not neglectful of his duties as a member. On 30 April 1689 he <b>moved</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> bring in a bill to settle the charters and privileges of the University of Cambridge, just as Sir Thomas Clarges did for Oxford at the same time, and he wrote a series of letters to Dr Lovel, the vice-chancellor of the university, on points which affected the interests of the university and its members.|$|R
50|$|On the day {{on which}} the item is {{included}} in the agenda, the Member concerned should <b>move</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> introduce the Bill and after the leave is granted formally to introduce the Bill. The Bill after introduction, will be published in the Gazette. If the Bill does not require the recommendation of the Governor for its consideration, the Member concerned should give notice of his intention to move for consideration of the Bill and for the Bill being passed.|$|E
50|$|The Speaker may {{order the}} {{publication}} of any Bill (together with the statement of objects and reasons accompanying) in the Gazette, although no motion has been made for leave to introduce the Bill. In that case, {{it is not necessary}} to <b>move</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> introduce the Bill and if the Bill in afterwards introduced, it is necessary to publish it again. The Speaker will cause a copy of the notice and of the Bill together with the statement of objects and reasons to be forwarded to the Secretary to the Governor and the Law Department.|$|E
5000|$|On Thursday, 12 December 1805, in {{the ninth}} Congress, Senator Stephen Roe Bradley of the State of Vermont gave notice that he should, on Monday next, <b>move</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> bring in a bill to {{prohibit}} the importation of certain persons therein described [...] "into any port or place within {{the jurisdiction of the}} United States, from and after the first day of January," [...] which will be [...] "in the year of our Lord 1808." [...] His words would be repeated many times by the legislators {{in the ninth}} Congress. The certain persons were described as being slaves on Monday, 16 December 1805.|$|E
40|$|After the Court {{restored}} {{this case}} to the calendar for re argument, the SG filed an amicus brief. Resps and other amici filed briefs and directed many of their arguments to the SG 2 ̆ 7 s brief. The SG now <b>moves</b> <b>for</b> special <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> file a reply brief as amicus {{so that he might}} address those arguments. He recognizes that Rule 36. 5 of this Court 2 ̆ 7 s Rules disallows such filings but contends that the importance of the Fourth Amendment issue presented and the United States 2 ̆ 7 substantial interest warrant an exception...|$|R
5000|$|We are at {{the moment}} out of the beaten path. If {{therefore}} {{we are determined to}} move only in that path, we cannot move at all. A man in a revolution resolving to do nothing which is not strictly according to established form resembles a man who has lost himself in the wilderness, and who stands crying [...] "Where is the king's highway? I will walk nowhere but on the king's highway." [...] In a wilderness a man should take the track which will carry him home. In a revolution we must have recourse to the highest law, the safety of the state. MaynardIn the convention which met on 22 January 1688/9, Maynard sat for Plymouth, and in the debate of the 28th {{on the state of the}} nation, and the conference with the lords which followed on 2 February, argued that James had vacated the throne by his Roman Catholicism, and attempted subversion of the constitution, and that as during his life he could have no heir, the choice lay between an alteration of the succession and a regency of indefinite duration. He supported the bill for declaring the convention a parliament on the very frank ground that a dissolution, owing to the ferment among the clergy, would mean the triumph of the tory party. On 5 March he was sworn lord commissioner of the great seal, jointly with Sir Anthony Keck and Sir William Rawlinson. This office did not exclude him from the House of Commons, and he continued to take an active part in its proceedings. On 16 March he <b>moved</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> introduce a bill for disarming papists; and while professing perfect confidence in the queen, he energetically opposed the bill for vesting the regency in her during William's absence from the realm, the passing of which into law was closely followed by his retirement or removal from office, his last appearance in court being on 14 May 1690.|$|R
500|$|This {{episode was}} written by {{consulting}} producer Jon Vitti, his second writing credit of the series since joining {{the staff at the}} beginning of the seventh season. It was directed by series star Steve Carell, the third episode he has directed for the series. The episode marked Amy Ryan's last physical appearance on the series, although she did speak in [...] "Goodbye, Michael". Ryan later said in an interview with New York that [...] "The script was so sweet anyway that it made us all have a good cry" [...] especially adding the fact that it was her final appearance. She also expressed her confidence that the series could survive without Carell and that it was the right <b>move</b> <b>for</b> him <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> Vitti later submitted the episode for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, but it was not nominated.|$|R

40|$|Farm—(collectively “Amici”) —hereby <b>move</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> {{submit the}} {{attached}} brief {{in support of}} the federal Defendant-Appellees and {{in support of the}} District Court’s ruling denying the Plaintiff-Appellants’ motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the 2013 final rule implementing mandatory country of origin labeling. See 78 Fed. Reg. 31, 367 (May 24, 2013) [JA 509 - 27]. As set forth more fully in the proposed brief, Amici are a broad coalition of agricultural producers, farm workers, and environmental and humane advocates who have a direct interest in this appeal, as disposition of this action could cause significant harm to their interests in protecting fair and competitive markets for agricultural products, preventing animal cruelty, promoting the quality of domestic production, and ensuring the survival of small farmers in America...|$|E
5000|$|Coupled {{with the}} fact that it was the start of Steve's {{departure}} and it was my own, yeah, there wasn't a dry eye in the house — literally, from the water pouring down on us and from our emotions. But it was a beautiful night ... We did it in two takes, but it took the crew quite a bit to vacuum up all the water with these big power vacs and reset everything as we stood by in robes, shivering.
