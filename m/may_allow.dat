5|$|Many major events, {{especially}} trade shows, issue press kits to pass-holders. A {{press pass}} <b>may</b> <b>allow</b> the bearer to request interviews with noteworthy attendees, and special rooms are sometimes {{set aside for}} this purpose.|$|E
5|$|A ridge soaring pilot uses upward air {{movements}} caused {{when the wind}} blows on {{to the sides of}} hills. It can also be augmented by thermals when the slopes also face the sun. In places where a steady wind blows, a ridge <b>may</b> <b>allow</b> virtually unlimited time aloft, although records for duration are no longer recognized because of the danger of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|Archaea host a {{new class}} of {{potentially}} useful antibiotics. A few of these archaeocins have been characterized, but hundreds more are believed to exist, especially within Haloarchaea and Sulfolobus. These compounds differ in structure from bacterial antibiotics, so they may have novel modes of action. In addition, they <b>may</b> <b>allow</b> the creation of new selectable markers for use in archaeal molecular biology.|$|E

5|$|Different AtPeps <b>may</b> <b>allow</b> A. thaliana to {{distinguish}} between different pathogens. When inoculated with a fungus, oomycete and a bacterium, the increases in AtPep expression varied depending on the pathogen. A. thaliana overexpressing AtProPep1 was more resistant to the oomycete Phythium irregulare.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{walking is}} of {{particular}} interest as an alternative form of locomotion in robots. The study of insects and bipeds has a significant impact on possible robotic methods of transport. This <b>may</b> <b>allow</b> new robots to be designed that can traverse terrain that robots with wheels may be unable to handle.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to extend {{the definition of the}} flow to more general inputs than curves, for instance by using rectifiable varifolds or the level set method. However, these extended definitions <b>may</b> <b>allow</b> parts of curves to vanish instantaneously or fatten into sets of nonzero area.|$|E
5000|$|A formal {{invitation}} was {{issued by the}} alliance on 2 December 2015. Final accession talks began in February 2016, and concluded in <b>May,</b> <b>allowing</b> Montenegro to take an [...] "observer" [...] status pending ratification by {{the governments of the}} other members, as well as by Montenegro's own parliament.|$|R

5|$|Millipedes {{in several}} orders have keel-like {{extensions}} of the body-wall known as paranota, which can vary widely in shape, size, and texture; modifications include lobes, papillae, ridges, crests, spines and notches. Paranota <b>may</b> <b>allow</b> millipedes to wedge more securely into crevices, protect the legs, or make the millipede more difficult for predators to swallow.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} can act {{at different}} levels of organisation, such as genes, cells, individual organisms, groups of organisms and species. Selection can act at multiple levels simultaneously. An example of selection occurring below the level of the individual organism are genes called transposons, which can replicate and spread throughout a genome. Selection at a level above the individual, such as group selection, <b>may</b> <b>allow</b> the evolution of cooperation, as discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} {{tests and}} adenosine deaminase testing <b>may</b> <b>allow</b> rapid diagnosis of TB. These tests, however, are not routinely recommended, as they rarely alter {{how a person}} is treated. Blood tests to detect antibodies are not specific or sensitive, so they are not recommended.|$|E
5000|$|Violence - Non-gratuitous and justifiable {{violence}} and gore <b>may</b> be <b>allowed.</b>|$|R
5|$|Beckett's surgery, which {{included}} his having a rib removed, {{made him a}} question mark for the Dodgers heading into 2014. He returned to the Dodgers on April 9 and made his first start since the previous <b>May,</b> <b>allowing</b> four runs in four innings. On May 13, {{he picked up his}} first win since 2012.|$|R
50|$|The GPS and {{location}} tracking product {{was announced in}} May 2014. An integration with Jawbone Up that <b>May</b> <b>allowed</b> Jawbone users to compare their exercise to their dog's in the same app. In late 2016, Whistle 3 was introduced. It is {{half the size of}} prior models and intended for smaller dogs or cats.|$|R
5|$|On October 16, 2017, Airbus {{announced}} {{a partnership with}} Bombardier Aerospace, taking over a majority share of the Bombardier CSeries airliner program. As {{a result of this}} partnership, Airbus plans to open an assembly line for CSeries aircraft in Mobile, particularly to serve the US market. This effort <b>may</b> <b>allow</b> the companies to circumvent high import tariffs on the CSeries family.|$|E
5|$|Primary implant {{stability}} {{refers to}} the stability of a dental implant immediately after implantation. The stability of the titanium screw implant in the patient's bone tissue post surgery may be non-invasively assessed using resonance frequency analysis. Sufficient initial stability <b>may</b> <b>allow</b> immediate loading with prosthetic reconstruction, though early loading poses {{a higher risk of}} implant failure than conventional loading.|$|E
5|$|Synthesized SGDs <b>may</b> <b>allow</b> {{multiple}} {{methods of}} message creation {{that can be}} used individually or in combination: messages can be created from letters, words, phrases, sentences, pictures, or symbols. With synthesized speech there is virtually unlimited storage capacity for messages with few demands on memory space.|$|E
50|$|The General Law Amendment Act, number 37 of 1963 (commenced 2 <b>May)</b> <b>allowed</b> a South African {{police officer}} to detain without warrant a person {{suspected}} of a politically motivated crime {{for up to}} 90 days without access to a lawyer. When used in practice, suspects were re-detained for another 90-day period immediately after release.|$|R

5|$|The {{lightness}} and rigidity of {{the blade}} compared to muscle and bone <b>may</b> <b>allow</b> blade runners to swing their legs faster than non-disabled runners. In comments on the article, Peter Weyand and biomechanist Matthew Bundle noted that {{the study found that}} Pistorius re-positioned his legs 15.7 percent faster than most world record sprinters, allowing for a 15 to 30 percent increase in sprint speed.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a direct}} {{competition}} between males to win {{the attention of the}} females in salamanders and newts, with elaborate courtship displays to keep the female's attention long enough to get her interested in choosing him to mate with. Some species store sperm through long breeding seasons, as the extra time <b>may</b> <b>allow</b> for interactions with rival sperm.|$|E
5|$|Through another genetic {{engineering}} application known as site-directed mutagenesis, researchers {{can alter the}} protein sequence and hence its structure, cellular localization, and susceptibility to regulation. This technique even allows the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins, using modified tRNAs, and <b>may</b> <b>allow</b> the rational design of new proteins with novel properties.|$|E

50|$|The exact {{location}} of the shipwreck was unknown until 2005. On 23 April, four divers found a shipwreck 50 km into Bass Strait and submerged in approximately 80 m of water, which {{was believed to be}} the former merchant ship. A more detailed inspection of the wreck site on 8 <b>May</b> <b>allowed</b> the divers to match the wreck with drawings of Kanowna.|$|R
50|$|Such {{games that}} feature these economies <b>may</b> also <b>allow</b> {{commodity}} trading and simulated stock markets.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the bark}} {{functions}} as a protective barrier, it is itself attacked by boring insects such as beetles. These lay their eggs in crevices and the larvae chew {{their way through the}} cellulose tissues leaving a gallery of tunnels. This <b>may</b> <b>allow</b> fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the tree. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried from one elm tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts to the growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were killed by this disease.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales have a {{relatively}} small brain compared to their body mass. Like other mammals, their brain has a large, folded cerebrum, {{the part of the}} brain responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their cerebrum only makes up about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The cerebellum, {{the part of the brain}} responsible for balance and coordination, makes up 18% of their brain's weight, compared to 10% in humans, which is probably due to the great degree of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on the brains of gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which <b>may</b> <b>allow</b> them to find magnetic north like a compass.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{should only}} be filled with suitably filtered air from diving air compressors or with other breathing gases using gas blending or decanting techniques. In some jurisdictions, suppliers of breathing gases are required by legislation to periodically test the quality of compressed air produced by their equipment and to display the test results for public information. The standards for industrial gas purity and filling equipment and procedures <b>may</b> <b>allow</b> some contaminants at levels unsafe for breathing, and their use in breathing gas mixtures at high pressure could be harmful or fatal.|$|E
