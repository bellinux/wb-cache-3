40|$|The study {{concentrates}} {{on the effects of}} structural parameters of an electronic fuel injector on its dynamic response (the opening delay and the closing delay). The injector was developed for a marine <b>medium-speed</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engine.</b> The dynamic response {{from the start of the}} control signal to the end of the needle valve closing were investigated. Firstly, a complete and detailed model of the electronic fuel injector was built and integrated into an optimisation model, where a MOGA was applied. Secondly, the importance and effects of main structural parameters on dynamic response were examined, as were their interactions. Finally, a Pareto optimum was obtained through scattering charts and comparisons were made between the baseline design and the optimal design. Results show that the control piston diameter, fuel oil inlet passage diameter, fuel oil outlet passage diameter and their interactions are influential factors to the opening delay, while the fuel oil inlet passage diameter has the dominant effect on the closing delay. A small control piston diameter together with a small fuel oil inlet passage diameter contribute to a short opening delay, however, they lead to a significant increase in the closing delay. Moreover, a small closing delay prefers a large fuel oil inlet passage diameter. The selected Pareto optimum achieved a significant reduction in both the opening delay and the closing delay under three different rail pressures...|$|E
40|$|Emissions factors (EFs) for gas and {{sub-micron}} particle-phase {{species were}} measured in intercepted plumes {{as a function}} of vessel speed from an underway research vessel, the NOAA ship Miller Freeman, operating a <b>medium-speed</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> on low-sulfur marine gas oil (fuel sulfur content ~ 0. 1 % by weight). The low-sulfur fuel in use conforms to the MARPOL fuel sulfur limit within emission control areas set to take effect in 2015 and to California-specific limits set to take effect in 2014. For many of the particle-phase species, EFs were determined using multiple measurement methodologies, allowing for an assessment of how well EFs from different techniques agree. The total sub-micron PM (PM 1) was dominated by particulate black carbon (BC) and particulate organic matter (POM), with an average POM / BC ratio of 1. 3. Consideration of the POM / BC ratios observed here with literature studies suggests that laboratory and in-stack measurement methods may overestimate primary POM EFs relative to those observed in emitted plumes. Comparison of four different methods for black carbon measurement indicates that careful attention must be paid to instrument limitations and biases when assessing EF BC. Particulate sulfate (SO 4 2 −) EFs were extremely small and the particles emitted by Miller Freeman were inefficient as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), even at high super saturations, consistent with the use of very low-sulfur fuel and the overall small emitted particle sizes. All measurement methodologies consistently demonstrate that the measured EFs (fuel mass basis) for PM 1 mass, BC and POM decreased as the ship slowed. Particle number EFs were approximately constant across the speed change, with a shift towards smaller particles being emitted at slower speeds. Emissions factors for gas-phase CO and formaldehyde (HCHO) both increased as the vessel slowed, while EFs for NO x decreased and SO 2 EFs were approximately constant...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} dynamic {{behavior}} of a spur gear pair. The gears studied are somewhat {{similar to the ones}} found in Bergen Engines <b>medium-speed</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> with regards to design, but some assumptions have been made when it comes to stiffness and damping. Gear components are an important part in advanced machines and have been a subject of studies due to increasing demands for higher performance and reliability and noise control. At first a dynamic model of a spur gear including time varying mesh stiffness and backlash is established in Fedem to be analyzed. The complicated phenomenon of tooth contact alternating between variable number of teeth pairs in contact and the presents of backlash, cause additional dynamic forces and is the main source of gear vibration. Backlash is unavoidable but also necessary in gear transmission preventing the teeth from jamming and allowing room for lubrication. The effect of backlash cause tooth separation and lead to contact loss during meshing. Parametric studies were conducted {{to examine the effects of}} the following variables; backlash, torque and rotational speed. For a system with no backlash, the gear teeth remained in contact throughout the gear mesh and did not experience contact loss or tooth separation. For small values of backlash, the analysis showed zero values for the moment which is a result of tooth separation. The time of contact loss increased with increasing value of backlash. For a systems with a given constant backlash, the variation in torque appeared as different values of time of contact loss. For decreasing values of torque the time of the tooth separation increased. The analysis clearly shows that the model experience backside contact. Backside contact is a result of backlash and fluctuations caused by the time varying mesh stiffness due to the contact ratio alternating between number of teeth in contact. When these fluctuations coincide with the natural vibration, resonance occur and results in backside contact. The results were in good agreement with the expectations and analytically showed the effects off backlash. The gears experience significant dynamic contributions as a cause of backlash and time variant mesh stiffness...|$|E
