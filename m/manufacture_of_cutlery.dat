6000|$|Denis Diderot {{was born}} at Langres in 1713, being thus a few months younger than Rousseau (1712), nearly twenty years younger than Voltaire (1694), nearly two years younger than Hume (1711), and eleven years older than Kant (1724). His stock was ancient and of good repute. The family had been engaged in the great local industry, the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>cutlery,</b> for no less than two centuries in direct line. Diderot liked {{to dwell on the}} {{historic}} prowess of his town, from the days of Julius Cæsar and the old Lingones and Sabinus, down to the time of the Great Monarch. With the taste of his generation for tracing moral qualities to a climatic source, he explained a certain vivacity and mobility in the people of his district by the great frequency and violence of its atmospheric changes from hot to cold, from calm to storm, from rain to sunshine. [...] "Thus they learn from earliest infancy to turn to every wind. The man of Langres has a head on his shoulders like the weathercock {{at the top of the}} church spire. It is never fixed at one point; if it returns to the point it has left, it is not to stop there. With an amazing rapidity in their movements, their desires, their plans, their fancies, their ideas, they are cumbrous in speech. For myself, I belong to my country side." [...] This was thoroughly true. He inherited all the versatility of his compatriots, all their swift impetuosity, and something of their want of dexterity in expression.|$|E
6000|$|He {{arrived in}} London {{in the midst}} of what is called [...] "the season," [...] and it seemed to him at first that he might here put himself in the way of being {{diverted}} from his heavy-heartedness. He knew no one in all England, but the spectacle of the mighty metropolis roused him somewhat from his apathy. Anything that was enormous usually found favor with Newman, and the multitudinous energies and industries of England stirred within him a dull vivacity of contemplation. It is on record that the weather, at that moment, was of the finest English quality; he took long walks and explored London in every direction; he sat by the hour in Kensington Gardens and beside the adjoining Drive, watching the people and the horses and the carriages; the rosy English beauties, the wonderful English dandies, and the splendid flunkies. He went to the opera and found it better than in Paris; he went to the theatre and found a surprising charm in listening to dialogue the finest points of which came within the range of his comprehension. He made several excursions into the country, recommended by the waiter at his hotel, with whom, on this and similar points, he had established confidential relations. He watched the deer in Windsor Forest and admired the Thames from Richmond Hill; he ate white-bait and brown-bread and butter at Greenwich, and strolled in the grassy shadow of the cathedral of Canterbury. He also visited the Tower of London and Madame Tussaud's exhibition. One day he thought he would go to Sheffield, and then, thinking again, he gave it up. Why should he go to Sheffield? He had a feeling that the link which bound him to a possible interest in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>cutlery</b> was broken. He had no desire for an [...] "inside view" [...] of any successful enterprise whatever, and he would not have given the smallest sum for the privilege of talking over the details of the most [...] "splendid" [...] business with the shrewdest of overseers.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{probably}} Harry Brearley’s upbringing in Sheffield, a city {{famous for the}} <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>cutlery</b> since the 16th century, which led him to appreciate the potential of these new steels for applications not only in high-temperature service, as originally envisioned, {{but also in the}} mass-production of food-related applications such as cutlery, saucepans and processing equipment etc. Up to that time carbon-steel knives were prone to unhygienic rusting if they were not frequently polished and only expensive sterling silver or EPNS cutlery was generally available to avoid such problems. With this in mind Brearley extended his examinations to include tests with food acids such as vinegar and lemon juice, with very promising results.|$|E
5000|$|By the {{beginning}} of the seventeenth century several village people were named in connection with the making of cutlery. William Smith, a yeoman of Grenoside, who died [...] "of great age" [...] in 1627 had taken out a cutlers mark in 1614. His son, Henry, {{was a member of the}} Cutler's Company in 1629. The <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>cutlery</b> was restricted to those who had served an apprenticeship in the trade; an apprentice served seven or ten years without pay. The restriction was closely controlled by the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire from 1624. As a result, many small nailmaking businesses were set up which was not so tightly controlled. As late as 1860, three nailmakers are listed as living and working in Grenoside.The Grenoside Sword Dance forms an important mid-winter ritual for the village and can be traced back to the 1750s [...] It is traditionally performed on Boxing Day morning in Main Street.|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} 1790 s, {{societies}} were formed in {{towns and cities}} across Britain {{with the aim of}} persuading the government to institute a wide-ranging and radical programme of political reform. Whilst political reform organisations were in themselves not new, these societies differed from their predecessors because they were, in the main, organised by and for men who contemporary society did not consider {{to be part of the}} political process: small tradesmen, artisans, journeymen, and labourers. Arguably the most radical and certainly one of the most popular of these new societies was the Sheffield Society for Constitutional Information. Historians have long sought to explain this surge of popular interest in political reform. They have pointed to the influence of earlier reform movements, the war with the American colonists, the campaigns to secure the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts and to the influence, most importantly, of the French Revolution and the popular debates that it inspired. But none of the existing historical scholarship adequately explains why radicalism emerged with such vigour in Sheffield, a town not previously noted for political activism. This thesis will attempt to fill this gap in our historical knowledge by looking at what was happening in the town in the seven years immediately preceding the formation of the S. S. C. I., years during which its principal industry, the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>cutlery,</b> was riven by a bitter and acrimonious dispute. It will show how under the influence of both external events and of radical and articulate leaders this dispute, which emanated from traditional economic grievances, became increasingly politicised and how, in the process, the working men of Sheffield came to believe that the only way to solve these economic grievances was through radical political reform...|$|E

40|$|The {{township}} of Stannington was {{a distinctive}} {{community on the}} north-western edge of Sheffield before being absorbed within {{the city in the}} twentieth century. By 1660 the inhabitants earned their living by a combination of farming and the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>cutlery,</b> albeit on a small scale. This thesis will demonstrate how the life of the community was affected by the boom in the Sheffield cutlery industry from the mid-eighteenth century. At that time the rapidly expanding industry, needing more water-power. began to spread out from the town along the tributaries of the River Don. The steep falls of water down the Loxley and Rivelin valleys encouraged the building of grinding wheels, leading to an increase in the workforce, mainly from the surrounding area of Hallamshire. Rural cutlery trades began to decline in the mid-nineteenth century. due to more efficient and economical methods of manufacture in Sheffield, but the employment gap in Stannington was filled by coal and gannister mining, together with work in the brickyards and paper mills. The continuing industrial growth altered not only the way of life, but the landscape itself as new works and houses sprang up, although farming continued to thrive. We shall see that, in spite of these changes in the economy, there survived a solid core of families, some of whom lived in Stannington for generation after generation, throughout the period covered by this thesis - and beyond. A detailed study of these longstanding families who held public office in the township, the parish and the wider areas of Hallamshire, will show how they adapted to the economic change and continued to give stability to their community. Newcomers to the township accepted and integrated into the ways of the old established families and, in many cases, became part of the core themselves...|$|E
40|$|For centuries, Sheffield and its {{surrounding}} hinterland of Hallamshire have been acknowledged as a distinct country famous for the manufacture of metal goods. In the eighteenth century, the discovery of new materials and technologies such as silver-plating, coincided {{with the rise of}} consumerism to create national and international demand {{for a wide range of}} fashionable and affordable table goods through which owners might demonstrate their taste, manners, discernment and sophistication. Sheffield became the centre of an industry that harnessed local technology, handskills, entrepreneurship with design, financing and marketing strategies to form a complex network of inter-dependent relationships whose success relied upon men who could afford to be neither parochial nor colloquial in their manners and outlook if their ambitions were to succeed. Yet, histories of the region have consistently focused on the perceived homogenous, labouring and plebeian nature of a population that became increasingly radicalised as the century progressed. Lacking a resident aristocracy by which to set the social tone or offer direction, the notion of Sheffield as a consumer of fashionable tablewares or as a locale in which evidence may be found of its engagement with Peter Borsay’s urban renaissance is one that has been consistently overlooked. Repetition of perceptions formulated in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries has resulted in Sheffield still being popularly perceived as much as a centre for political activism as the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>cutlery.</b> Renewed interest in the eighteenth century as a period of social and cultural change has introduced new methodologies and understandings with which to explore the ways in which middling and provincial societies sought to establish their identities. They have highlighted how politeness offered them a flexible framework in which wealth and status could be displayed and a respectable niche in the social order secured. Whilst not creating a distinct social class, politeness facilitated the middling sorts in the brokering of new relationships that spanned parish boundaries and the establishment of identities that best served the needs and understandings of provincial societies. This thesis will argue that Sheffield was home to an articulate, educated and urbane middle sector of society who employed the practices, accoutrements and spaces associated with politeness in the shaping of their identity and whose contribution to the social and cultural development of the region should no longer be overlooked. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Recent {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} changing the plateware can affect the perceived taste and flavour of food, but very {{little is known about}} visual and proprioceptive influences <b>of</b> <b>cutlery</b> on the response of consumers to the food sampled from it. In the present study, we report three experiments designed to investigate whether food tastes different when the visual and tactile properties <b>of</b> the plastic <b>cutlery</b> from which it is sampled are altered. We independently varied the weight, size, colour, and shape <b>of</b> <b>cutlery.</b> We assessed the impact of changing the sensory properties <b>of</b> the <b>cutlery</b> on participants’ ratings of the sweetness, saltiness, perceived value, and overall liking of the food tasted from it. Results: The results revealed that yoghurt was perceived as denser and more expensive when tasted from a lighter plastic spoon as compared to the artificially weighted spoons; the size of the spoon only interacted with the spoon-weight factor for the perceived sweetness of the yoghurt. The taste of the yoghurt was also affected by the colour <b>of</b> the <b>cutlery,</b> but these effects depended on the colour of the food as well, suggesting that colour contrast may have been responsible for the observed effects. Finally, we investigated the influence of the shape <b>of</b> the <b>cutlery.</b> The results showed that the food was rated as being saltiest when sampled from a knife rather than from a spoon, fork, or toothpick. Conclusions: Taken together, these results demonstrate that the properties <b>of</b> the <b>cutlery</b> can indeed affect people’s taste perception of everyday foods, most likely when expectations regarding the cutlery or the food have been disconfirmed. We discuss these results in the context of changing environmental cues in order to modify people’s eating habits.
