Accordingly, the text entry fields of <b>work</b> <b>orders</b> can contain any words, in any number, as necessary. Data quality is crucial in statistical analysis of <b>work</b> <b>orders</b> data, and therefore manual analysis of work orders’ text entry fields is often necessary before any decision making.

This research explores {{the hypothesis that}} the failure behaviour of {{mining equipment}} is influenced by the physical properties of the ore and waste. We describe a method of examining this relationship via data mining on maintenance records and apply it to the hydraulic cylinders of two classes of earthmoving mobile equipment. Failure data for the analysis are drawn from <b>maintenance</b> <b>work</b> <b>orders</b> from 14 sites mining for haematite iron, nickel sulphide, and coking and thermal coal. The results show that the distributions of the estimated life parameters for hydraulic cylinders on earthmoving equipment are distinctly different for haematite iron, coal, and nickel sulphide sites. Analysis of the relationship between selected physical properties identified the influence of rock impact hardness number, abrasion index, and absolute hardness of the ore as significant factors for these hydraulic cylinders. Their effects are significant when parameters are considered in combination, for example, rock impact hardness number and abrasion index, and vary according to the cylinder type and asset class.

40|$|Railway {{signalling}} {{systems are}} composed of several different systems; {{each has its own}} purpose, but the main functionality of the overall system is determined by the interoperability between them. Railway signalling systems ensure the safe operation of the railway network, and their reliability and maintainability directly affect the capacity and availability of the railway network, in terms of both infrastructure and trains. The functionality of the signalling system is based on the principle of “fail safe”; this means that the railway section where a failure is located will be not fully operative until the failure is repaired (since safety cannot be ensured). Hence, the dependability of these systems directly affects the capacity of the network. Signalling systems take up {{a large part of the}} railway’s overall corrective maintenance. Railway managers need to have a holistic view of all systems to optimise maintenance. Signalling systems are especially important, given the need for interoperability. Given their complexity, knowledge must be correctly managed to ensure proper performance in all phases of the life cycle. Enhancing information logistics would lead to considerable improvements in this area. This licentiate analyses the dependability and maintenance of railway signalling systems and proposes various approaches to improve maintenance performance. External factors affecting the reliability of signalling systems are identified, such as their location. The signalling system is treated as a system of systems because of its interoperability and because failures occurring on different systems can be associated with the same failure effect. A data driven model for maintenance decision support is proposed, based on corrective <b>maintenance</b> <b>work</b> <b>orders.</b> The data driven model allows a holistic perspective of failure occurrence, as it integrates the information recorded in the many different parameters of the corrective <b>maintenance</b> <b>work</b> <b>orders.</b> With this model, existing maintenance policies could be reviewed and improved upon. This thesis proposes a model for configuration management, which simplifies the access and visibility of information. The model manages the change control process and ensures that configurations are updated in real-time. An enhancement of the configuration management has the potential to increase the efficacy of the maintenance actions in signalling systems by improving the accessibility of the information required to understand possible future failures. With increased accessible knowledge, the time needed to identify failures can be reduced, resulting in greater maintenance efficiency. It also establishes a framework for improving inter-organisational knowledge management between stakeholders, resulting in the creation of a holistic perspective of the maintenance and operation of the railway network, avoiding the loss of knowledge linked to outsourcing, and improving the effectiveness of the organisations involved.

40|$|Implementing a {{predictive}} maintenance model {{does not have}} to be a five year, million dollar project. There are relatively simple steps a maintenance team can take to see results within the first year. Because overall cost of {{predictive maintenance}} is up to four time less expensive than preventative maintenance, as many assets as possible should be covered by predictive maintenance. Facilitating the transition to predictive maintenance is made easier with a Computerized Maintenance Management System. A good CMMS is user-friendly, automatically produces preventative <b>maintenance</b> <b>work</b> <b>orders,</b> and tracks all work done on each piece of machinery. IR scans and vibration analysis are two predictive maintenance techniques that can increase uptime. IR scans are an effective way to find loose or dirty electrical connections before they cause machine down time.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Building Information Modeling (BIM), {{has been}} practiced {{for several years}} by {{designers}} and contractors in design and construction phases. After receiving a positive feedback of the BIM in industry, owners are now interested in getting {{the benefits of the}} BIM in operations and maintenance. The information value produced during each phases of the project drops in phase transfer during the building lifecycle, and this drop has the highest value in transition from construction to operations and maintenance (O&M). BIM can capture the O&M information produced during the phases of pre-design, design, and construction, and transfer it to the operations and maintenance phase. Construction Operations Building Information Exchange (COBie) was developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers as a method of delivering O&M information and project specific data in a standardized format. COBie can be extracted from BIM, and be imported to Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) of the owner where the <b>maintenance</b> <b>work</b> <b>orders</b> are managed. The value of COBie for Facility Management is determined in two phases of turn over, and operations and maintenance. The value of COBie at University of Washington in turn over phase was investigated previously, and this research study focuses mainly on the value of COBie in operations and maintenance. Interviews with Facility Services (FS) employees were conducted to understand the <b>work</b> <b>order</b> <b>work</b> flows, and how COBie can impact it. The challenges FS employees are facing performing the <b>work</b> <b>orders</b> are related to two categories of sources and processes, and research study has investigated how COBie can address these challenges and help the <b>work</b> <b>order</b> process. Based on the interview result analysis, since COBie can provide comprehensive O&M data from the first day of operations with high accuracy, it can considerably ease the <b>work</b> <b>order</b> process. But FS employees are also reliant on other sources and documents like as-build plans and O&M manuals to get information to perform <b>work</b> <b>orders.</b> COBie is not enough on its own to provide all the information needed for Facility Management, but based on the COBie standard and the data provided in each project, FS employees can be less reliant on other sources than COBie...|$|R

The {{maintenance}} {{management in the}} companies should be involved on the reduction of losses, wastes and breakdowns so that together with other areas, they progress towards a lean manufacturing company as Zollner Electronics Costa Rica Ltd. intends to be. To achieve that, one of the bases is the total productive maintenance (TPM), with which it is sought to increase indices of efficiency, availability and quality. To do this, the project starts with the application of 5 S (an important key for TPM implementation) both in the maintenance department and in the production lines of the SMT area. Subsequently, autonomous maintenance and focused improvements are introduced as initial pillars. For the former, manuals are made and implemented for the most critical machines in the production process. For the focused improvements, signaling {{is placed on the}} compressed air inlet gauges to the machines and the cleaning activities have been strengthening for sensors and nozzles which have presented considerable errors in the past. To complement and improve the {{maintenance management}}, it has been made a codification for the equipment, the criticality has been defined and the <b>maintenance</b> <b>work</b> <b>orders</b> have been introduced, while the department's digital information system has been improved. It is sought to measure the improvements and analysis {{of the impact of the}} maintenance on the company, so it is implemented maintenance indexes such as TMEF, TMDR, reliability and availability.

40|$|The modern mining {{industry}} is highly mechanized and relies on massive, multimillion-dollar {{pieces of equipment}} for achieving production targets. In an increasingly challenging international economic climate, mining operations are reliant on economies of scale to remain competitive. To maximize revenue, {{it is imperative that}} at each stage of the mining process, equipment is operating optimally without preventable and unnecessary interruptions. As a result, the focus of all mining operations is to increase equipment uptime and utilization. The Aitik open pit copper mine is located approximately 15 km south-east of the town of Gällivare in Northern Sweden. It is the largest copper mine in Sweden and uses a conventional truck-shovel operation. The loading fleet at Aitik consists of several power shovels to load trucks with blasted material for transport, either to the crushers or to the waste dumps. The maintenance activities for mining shovels are critical when it comes to keeping them available for production. Hence, any attempt to achieve improvements in the maintenance function for mining shovels, is a worthwhile endeavour. The Aitik mine employs various computer-aided applications to track and maintain mobile mining equipment. These applications also serve as chronological operational and maintenance databases for the equipment. The work presented in this thesis comprises six mining shovels and is based on the analysis of three data types; historical maintenance data from CMMS Maximo, operational data from mine management system Cat® MineStar™, and event-log data from individual shovels. The data sets span over two years from March 2010 to March 2012 and, were sourced from the maintenance department at the Aitik mine. As part of this investigation, the three distinct data sets were analysed separately and further research was undertaken to integrate them. For a standalone investigation of individual data types, separate methods of analysis were required. Historical maintenance data consisted of over sixteen and a half thousand individual <b>work</b> <b>orders.</b> These were analyzed to identify shovel subsystems and components with respect to the number of associated corrective <b>maintenance</b> <b>work</b> <b>orders.</b> From MineStar data, maintenance key performance indicators such as availability, mean time between failures, and mean time to restore were calculated, using European standard EN 15341 : 2007. Such KPIs are useful for identifying underperforming assets within the shovel fleet, and provide a quantifiable means for benchmarking maintenance performance. Finally, frequently recurring events were identified through a Pareto analysis and were correlated with historical maintenance data. The results from this study indicate towards viable prospects for such a synthesis. A regular time-lapse integration of the diverse data types displays potential; and could prove to be helpful, for achieving overall improvements in the maintenance function. In addition, this integration could prove to be beneficial from an operational standpoint. For instance, such a data synthesis can aid {{in the development of a}} proactive and collaborative approach towards asset management. Validerat; 20121105 (anonymous...|$|R

The results of the analysis showed that for all types of <b>maintenance</b> <b>work</b> in- house work forces provided comparable if not better value to their customers than contracted work forces. This service was delivered with roughly the same response time and usually at the same or lower cost. Additionally, because of the projected rate increases at PWC Jacksonville the value PWC Pensacola's customers receive will be even greater for the next several years[URL]...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{economic}} crisis has prompted many organizations to review their maintenance operations {{with the main}} objective of controlling costs while trying to maintain a similar level of services and quality. The healthcare industry in Saudi Arabia faced a similar set of problems as the main sponsor (i. e. the Government) received lower revenues from oil export. As intimated by Saudi government officials, the current growth rate in healthcare expenditure is unsustainable {{in the longer term}} and efforts are being made to manage resources more efficiently. One area under consideration is the maintenance functions of Saudi hospitals and clinics, as these operations accounted for the bulk of the maintenancerelated expenditure. As the largest strategic hospital in the Kingdom, the Riyadh Military Hospital (RMH) has a long term plan to improve the quality and reliability of its services, through better utilization of resources. The present project forms part of the on-going strategic review of the hospital’s current maintenance operations including outsourcing and subsequent management of contractors and suppliers. A key challenge is to understand how maintenance activities could be managed more successfully and implemented in a cost-effective way. Two sets of questionnaires were designed and distributed to the staff including contractors in the Maintenance Department. The questionnaire surveys were supplemented by interviews to assess the managers’ awareness/understanding of the importance of leadership, change management, transparency, documentation, communication and clarity of strategy. By means of statistical analysis, the data/information thus gathered was analyzed using a range of quality and reliability tools and techniques. A number of correlations have been identified which confirmed the observations of previous studies. For example, there appeared to be a significant correlation between "the clarity of strategy" and "consistency of maintenance performance", and between "a happy worker" and "the clarity of instructions" and "availability of appropriate tools". Five main parameters have been identified as {{critical to the success of}} the maintenance operations at RMH: clarity of policies and procedures; support of senior management; organizational structure; employee qualifications (i. e. technical knowledge and skills); and clarity of maintenance contracts (including communications with external contractors). Informed by the work of others for the engineering and related industries, a maintenance management framework has been proposed for the healthcare industry in Saudi Arabia. Part of the framework has been implemented at the case study hospital to facilitate validation. It was found that the framework provides a useful means for integrating various maintenance-related activities and to allow guidelines to be provided on the monitoring and control of the processes. This in turn enabled a substantial revision to be made to the current maintenance procedures at the hospital. The effectiveness of the revised maintenance procedures has been investigated using limited field studies. It is pleasing to note that encouraging results have been obtained. For example, the total number of dockets (i. e. <b>maintenance</b> <b>work</b> <b>orders)</b> issued for general maintenance over a 4 -month period fell by 23 % when compared with the figure for the previous year. The present study has made a significant contribution in the development of a maintenance management framework for the healthcare industry in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia...|$|R
