5|$|After Brantinghame Hall closed, {{he again}} played Chrysos in {{a revival of}} Pygmalion and Galatea at the Lyceum Theatre and played <b>Mr</b> <b>Barnes</b> in his own play, To the Death, at the Olympic Theatre. He then {{appeared}} at the Comedy Theatre under Charles Hawtrey in Pickwick (1889), a successful one-act musical play by F. C. Burnand and Edward Solomon based on an episode in The Pickwick Papers, which Barrington ended up directing and in which he alternated in the roles of Pickwick and Baker. Barrington then created the role of Lt. Col. Cadbury in a Grundy farce called Merry Margate and next played Tosser in a comic opera by Solomon and George P. Hawtrey called Penelope, in which he co-starred with Dan Leno. He also played {{a number of other}} roles in other theatres throughout 1889 until he rejoined D'Oyly Carte to create the role of Giuseppe in The Gondoliers in December 1889, remaining for the long run of that last Gilbert and Sullivan hit.|$|E
25|$|When {{flying the}} four wings are spread quite far apart, fore and hind {{wing of the}} same side far apart, body horizontal. Flight slow enough so that the {{movements}} of each separate wing can be seen—insect consequently moves slowly but can dodge. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Barnes</b> compared {{the movements of the}} wings to that of a windmill, but the revolving movements are lacking; I should say the effect produced by the wings is more like that of a jumping-jack with moveable arms and legs pulled by one string, rather slowly, but, of course, at regular intervals.|$|E

In a bar, she relapses. Jenny and Dave drive her home, where she starts an altercation with Charlie.|$|R

2500|$|The elder <b>Mr.</b> <b>Barnes</b> died in 1849. [...] At that time, {{the company}} was reorganized as Hobbs, Barnes and Company, with the two Hobbs men and younger Barnes as the owners. [...] Not only did the glass company change its name, the {{community}} where the glass works was located also changed its name. [...] In 1850, the community of Ritchietown incorporated as South Wheeling.|$|E
2500|$|In 1917, the {{committee}} hired {{a real estate}} agent named <b>Mr.</b> <b>Barnes</b> to negotiate the purchase of a site in Burkeville, Virginia. This time, {{the committee}} asked a group of citizens from Burkeville to sign a statement which said that the sanatorium could be built there. Nonetheless, opposition emerged for a third time. An attorney named Mr. H.H. Watson {{wrote a letter to the}} committee on behalf of a group of citizens who opposed locating the sanatorium in Burkeville. Impatient with the delays, this time the State Board of Health ignored the opposition and began construction of Piedmont Sanatorium on a [...] parcel in Burkeville.|$|E

He often sneaks away to smoke tobacco. He is divorced, having formerly resided in Florida before moving into Cate's basement, and often {{used to try to}} beat C.J. with his cane. He takes pride in C.J.'s success as a teacher. When C.J.'s biological father comes to visit his son, Jim feels out of place and angry because he prepared a car for C.J. after he becomes a full-fledged teacher, but then <b>Mr.</b> <b>Barnes</b> gives C.J. a sports car.|$|E
2500|$|Hercule Poirot {{leaves the}} office of his dentist, Morley, after an {{appointment}}, and notices the arrival of Mabelle Sainsbury Seale. He returns to her the shiny buckle that has fallen from her shoe. Later, he hears from Inspector Japp that Morley has died of a gunshot. Between Poirot's appointment and Morley's death {{there were only three}} patients: Alistair Blunt, a banker; Mabelle Sainsbury Seale; and a Greek secret agent and blackmailer, surnamed Amberiotis. The presence of Blunt, a man thought essential to Britain's economic survival, ensures Japp's involvement in the case. Amberiotis dies of an overdose of anaesthetic and it is thought that the dentist has killed himself after realising the accident for which he had been responsible; but Poirot does not believe this. The movements of people at the dental surgery are inconclusive. Morley's partner, Reilly, seems to have no motive. Morley's secretary had been called away by a fake telegram. Her sleazy boyfriend, Frank Carter, had a weak motive, given that Morley had attempted to dissuade her from seeing him. Also present at the surgery was Howard Raikes, a hard-nosed American left-wing activist, violently opposed to Blunt but enamoured of Blunt's niece, Jane Olivera. Poirot has a long discussion with another patient from that day, a retired civil servant from the Home Office, <b>Mr</b> <b>Barnes,</b> who knows that Amberiotis is a spy, and suspects that Blunt was the actual target of the murder: [...] "They're out after Blunt all right. That I know." ...|$|E
