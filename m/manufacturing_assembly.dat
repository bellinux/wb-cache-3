In October 1940, Bloch refused to collaborate with the Germans occupiers at Bordeaux-Aéronautique and was imprisoned by the Vichy government. In 1944 the Nazis deported Bloch to the Buchenwald concentration camp, while his wife was interned near Paris. Bloch was detained at Buchenwald until it was liberated on 11 April 1945.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} general mixture model {{framework}} for automobile warranty data that includes parameters for product field performance, the <b>manufacturing</b> and <b>assembly</b> process, and dealer preparation process. The model fits warranty claims as {{a mixture of}} <b>manufacturing</b> or <b>assembly</b> defects (quality problems) and usage related failures (reliability problems). The model also estimates the fraction of vehicles containing a <b>manufacturing</b> or <b>assembly</b> defect when leaving the assembly plant. This parameter measures {{the quality of the}} entire vehicle production process, i. e., component <b>manufacturing</b> and final <b>assembly.</b> The model also measures the proportion of <b>manufacturing</b> or <b>assembly</b> defects repaired by the automobile dealer prior to customer delivery. This conditional probability quantifies the ability of the vehicle preparation process to identify and repair defects prior to customer delivery. To apply the model to field failure or warranty data, the practitioner must identify parametric distributions for each of the two failure processes. To demonstrate the model, this paper develops a Weibull-Uniform mixture for manufacturer supplied warranty claim data...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate the use of process-based <b>manufacturing</b> and <b>assembly</b> cost models in a traditional performancefocused multidisciplinary design and optimization process. The use of automated cost-performance analysis is an enabling technology that could bring realistic process-based <b>manufacturing</b> and <b>assembly</b> cost into multidisciplinary design and optimization. In this paper, we present a new methodology for incorporating process costing into a standard multidisciplinary design optimization process. Material, <b>manufacturing</b> processes, and <b>assembly</b> processes costs then could be used as the objective function for the optimization method. A case study involving forty-six different configurations of a simple wing is presented, indicating that a design based on performance criteria alone may not necessarily be the most affordable as far as <b>manufacturing</b> and <b>assembly</b> cost is concerned...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the rapidly}} growing {{industry}} of composite <b>manufacturing</b> and <b>assembly</b> plays the cost reduction a decisive {{role in shaping the}} future of this industry. This key role necessitates adopting cost reducing strategies through the implementation of more efficient novel technologies in the composite <b>manufacturing</b> and <b>assembly</b> processes. However, the determination of the bottlenecks within the process as well as the definition of the suitable technical solutions can be only detected and realized through a systematic cost modeling. Moreover, the effectiveness of any cost reduction strategy should be determined by a comprehensive attributional or consequential cost modeling. Practically, cost modeling can be performed on different fidelity levels based on the goal of the assessment, data availability as well as data complexity. Within this paper a selection of different approaches of cost modeling for the composite <b>manufacturing</b> and <b>assembly</b> are discussed. This paper illustrates the characteristics of these approaches as well as their applicability for the composites <b>manufacturing</b> and <b>assembly</b> processes especially in the early technology development phases...|$|R
