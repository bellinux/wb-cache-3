25|$|Post this intimation, I was {{informed}} {{for the first}} time yesterday by the BCCI that the Captain had reservations with my 'style' and about my continuing as the Head Coach. I was surprised since I have always respected the role boundaries between Captain and Coach. Though the BCCI attempted to resolve the misunderstandings between the Captain and me, it was apparent that the partnership was untenable, and I therefore believe it is best for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on.|$|E
25|$|I owe {{so much to}} Brett, and teamTBB. It was Brett that {{advised me}} to turn pro, {{he told me to}} do an Ironman and he trained me to win two World Ironman Championships. Not only that, the Team {{framework}} enabled me to train with some of the best athletes in the world; to grow and develop as a person and to learn some incredibly important lessons. With the Team I reached heights that I never thought possible, and for that I am truly grateful. teamTBB is focused on helping 'development athletes' who might otherwise not have the opportunity to succeed in professional triathlon. I no longer fit into their framework, and hence {{the time has come for}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on.|$|E

A month later, last remaining original member Foley also announced his departure. He expressed interest in focusing on his adult music career.

500|$|Björk {{chose the}} title Post for two reasons. Firstly, {{it refers to}} the fact that all the songs on the album were written after her move to England, while the songs on Debut were songs she had written during the {{previous}} ten years of her life in Iceland. In a 1996 interview, Björk said: [...] "I always knew it would be two albums and that's why I called them Debut and Post. Before and after". Secondly, the title was inspired by the singer's desire to communicate with friends and family back in Iceland, giving Post the additional meaning of [...] "mail". Talking with Raw in 1996, Björk stated: [...] "I called the record Post, because I always address my songs back in my head to Iceland in a letter. Because it was such a big jump for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away from all my relatives, all my friends, everything I know".|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1970s, Danzig {{started the}} Misfits, {{releasing}} the band's records {{through his own}} label, (originally known as Blank, then later as Plan 9). Danzig had attempted to get the Misfits signed to several record labels, {{only to be told}} that he would never have a career in music. The impetus for the band's name comes from Marilyn Monroe's last film, combined with Danzig considering himself to be a [...] "social misfit." [...] In October 1983, after releasing several singles and three albums, and gaining a small underground following, Danzig disbanded the Misfits due to increasing animosity among the band members and his dissatisfaction with their musical abilities. Danzig explained his decision: “It was difficult for me to work with those guys, because they weren't prepared to put in the hours practicing. I wanted to move things forward, and they didn't seem to have the same outlook. So it was time for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Nicholas {{had long}} had his heart set on marrying Princess Alix of Hesse-Darmstadt, a {{favourite}} grandchild of Queen Victoria. Despite {{the fact that}} she was their godchild, neither Alexander III nor Maria approved of the match. Nicholas summed up the situation as follows: [...] "I wish to move in one direction, and it is clear that Mama wishes <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in another– my dream is to one day marry Alix." [...] Maria and Alexander found Alix shy and somewhat peculiar. They were also concerned that the young Princess was not possessed of the right character to be Empress of Russia. Nicholas's parents had known Alix as a child and formed the impression that she was hysterical and unbalanced, which may have been due the loss of her mother and youngest sister, Marie, to diphtheria when she was just six. It was only when Alexander III's health was beginning to fail that they reluctantly gave permission for Nicholas to propose.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, the Redskins started 2–0 but {{finished}} 5–11, {{with several}} close losses {{coming down to}} the 4th quarter. The offense was a bit improved, but the departure of defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis to become the {{head coach of the}} Cincinnati Bengals saw the defense fade from 5th in scoring defense during the previous season to 24th in 2003. The team as a whole faded late in the season, and were outscored 85–31 over their last three games. Spurrier resigned on December 30, 2003, choosing to walk away from $15 million still owed to him over the remaining three years of his contract. In a statement released by the team, Spurrier said [...] "I apologize to Redskins fans that we did not reach a level of success that we had all hoped... It's a long grind and I feel (that) after 20 years as a head coach there are other things I need to do. I simply believe this is the right time for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on because this team needs new leadership." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{leaving the}} seminary, Fernandes moved to Bombay in 1949 {{in search of}} a job. His life was tough in Bombay, and he had to sleep on the streets, until he got a job as a {{proofreader}} for a newspaper.

In {{the middle of the night}} policemen used to come and wake me up and ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on." [...] He came into contact with veteran union leader Placid D'Mello, and the socialist Rammanohar Lohia, who were the greatest influences on his life. Later, he joined the socialist trade union movement. He rose to prominence as a trade unionist and fought for the rights of labourers in small scale service industries such as hotels and restaurants. Emerging as a key figure in the Bombay labour movement in the early 1950s, Fernandes was a central figure in the unionisation of sections of Bombay labour in the 1950s. As a labour organiser, he served many prison terms when his workforce engaged in fights with company goons. He served as a member of the Bombay Municipal Corporation from 1961 to 1968. He won in the civic election in 1961 and, until 1968, continuously raised the problems of the exploited workers in the representative body of the metropolis.|$|E
