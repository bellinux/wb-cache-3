5|$|After {{the first}} salvo from the 15cm {{batteries}} in Drøbak, the steering {{from the bridge}} was disabled. Blücher had just passed Drøbakgrunnen (Drøbak shallows) and was in a turn to port. The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts, but she lost speed. Normally the rudder is controlled electrically from the bridge to the motors forward of the Handsteuerraum (hand steering room) deep under the armored deck, forward of the rudder. In an emergency it can be switched within seconds to <b>manual</b> <b>steering,</b> but orders from the bridge to the rudder may be delayed. At 04:34 Norwegian land-based torpedo batteries scored two hits on the ship. The targeting device in the torpedo battery was very primitive. The speed of the torpedo was known and set, but {{the speed of the}} target had to be adjusted by dead reckoning (guessing).|$|E
25|$|On 16 April at 7:30a.m. (KST), {{third mate}} Park Han-kyul and {{helmsman}} Cho Joon-ki {{took over the}} watch from the previous team. At this point in time, Sewol was heading at a course of about 165 degrees {{at the speed of}} about 20 knots, and was operating two radar devices. Around 8:20a.m. when the ship was about 2-3 miles from entering the Maenggol Channel, Park ordered Cho to change the steering system from autopilot to <b>manual</b> <b>steering.</b> When Sewol arrived at the channel on 8:27a.m. at a course of around 137 degrees, the wind speed was between 4 and 7 meters per second, the wave height about 0.5 meters, and the visibility good.|$|E
25|$|By 13:35, Winslow {{reached a}} point {{approximately}} 1,500 yards from her quarry when a white puff of smoke from Antonio Lópezs bow gun signaled {{the beginning of an}} artillery duel which lasted one hour and 20 minutes. Winslow responded with her 1-pounders. The Spanish concentrated their efforts on Winslow, and she soon received several direct hits. The first shot to score on the torpedo boat destroyed both her steam and <b>manual</b> <b>steering</b> gear. Her crew tried to rig an auxiliary steering system, but she swung broadside to the enemy and a shot pierced her hull near the engine room and knocked the port main engine out of commission. She maneuvered with her remaining engine to evade enemy fire and maintained a steady return fire with her 1-pounders. Wilmington and Hudson brought their guns to bear on the Spanish ship and shore, and the combined fire of the three American warships put the Spanish tugboat out of action while several waterfront buildings caught fire.|$|E

2500|$|Mechanical {{revisions}} for 1962 were extensive. The {{electrical system}} was extensively upgraded, {{with a new}} gear-reduction starter, new alternator, more fuses, and printed circuit boards rather than individual wires for the instrument cluster. Carburetors were improved again, the manual transmission gearshift was moved from the floor to the steering column, there were new 45°-shear engine mounts replacing the previous vertical-shear items, exhaust systems were made of more corrosion-resistant (aluminized) materials, and axle ratios were altered for better fuel economy. <b>Manual</b> <b>steering</b> ratio was changed from 20:1 to 24:1, and both power and <b>manual</b> <b>steering</b> gearboxes were new, the latter now housed in aluminum rather than iron.

2500|$|Continuing {{the concept}} of VAM's version of the AMC Rebel, the Mexican Matadors were only {{available}} as a single trim level and in four-door sedan and two-door hardtop forms in their initial year. The hardtop retained the Rambler Classic SST name while the four-door sedan changed from Rambler Classic 770 to Rambler Classic DPL. Both body styles saw the same features as the 1971 AMC Matadors and were almost equal with only few exclusive characteristics for each. Standard equipment consisted of four-wheel manual drum bakes, <b>manual</b> <b>steering,</b> [...] gross at 4600 RPM [...] I6 engine with Carter WCD two-barrel carburetor and 9.5:1 compression ratio, fully synchronized three-speed manual transmission with column shift, 10-inch heavy duty clutch, 3.54:1 rear differential gear ratio with manual transmission, 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio with automatic transmission, electric two-speed wipers, electric washers, rectangular full-length 200km/h speedometer, electric analog clock, collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch, luxury custom steering wheel, courtesy lights, cigarette lighter, dashboard ashtray, locking glove box, wide individual front seats (hardtop), front bench seat (sedan), two-point front seatbelts, front and rear side armrests, dual rear ashtrays, single round dome light (sedan), dual C-pillar dome lights (hardtop), dual coat hooks, bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, and driver's side remote mirror.

50|$|The Zanardi Edition {{was similar}} to the Japanese market NSX Type S. Visible {{differences}} between the Zanardi Edition and the Type S were the Zanardi's left-hand drive, black leather and suede seats with red stitching, airbag-equipped Acura steering wheel, and a brushed-aluminium plaque with an engraved Acura logo, Zanardi's signature, and a serial number on the rear bulkhead. Total vehicle weight is reduced 149 lb compared to the NSX-T, {{through the use of a}} fixed hard-top roof, lighter rear spoiler, single pane rear glass, lightweight BBS alloy wheels, a lighter battery, and a <b>manual</b> rack-and-pinion <b>steering</b> system in place of the electric power steering.|$|R
25|$|During {{much of the}} 20th century, Saginaw's {{economy was}} {{dominated}} by manufacturing related to the automotive industry; most notably, <b>manual</b> transmission assemblies, <b>steering</b> gear boxes and power steering pumps. At the height of manufacturing in the 1960s and 1970s, the city and neighboring Buena Vista Township hosted 12 General Motors plants, an Eaton Manufacturing plant where 5,000 people turned out auto parts (demolished 2008), and numerous smaller concerns.|$|R
2500|$|The {{introductory}} 1974 Gremlins became unique {{by incorporating}} the front clip of the 1974 U.S. AMC Hornet models. VAM never attempted {{to hide the}} relation between the two models, which never harmed the sales or image of either model and was favored by the public. The launch of the Gremlin in Mexico also meant the resurrection of the [...] I6 engine that was discontinued in 1972. The engine was practically the same as in its final year except for a slightly lower compression ratio (8.3:1 instead of 8.5:1). The advertised output was still the same at 145 gross horsepower at 4,400 revolutions per minute and was restricted to one-barrel carburetors. In contrast, since 1973 all VAM-based Hornets had the [...] six as the standard and only engine. VAM Gremlins were basic economy cars with manual 3-speed transmission, four-wheel drum brakes, <b>manual</b> <b>steering,</b> front sway bar, column-mounted shifters only, rigid four-bladed cooling fan, folding bench seats, two-point front seatbelts, electric wipers and washers, monaural AM radio, cigarette lighter, front and rear ashtrays, locking glovebox, flip-open rear side vents, roof rack, full carpeting with driver's side rubber mat, padded sunvisors, sound-insulating cardboard-type headliner, dual coat hooks and round dome light. Options for 1974 included a column-mounted automatic transmission, power steering, power drum brakes, heater, parcel shelf, light group, remote-controlled driver and passenger side outside mirrors, sports steering wheel, bright molding package, and wheel trim rings. All VAM Gremlins used the AMC's three-pod instrument cluster from the domestic-built Hornet with a blank in the third gauge position from the factory. The introductory year production was 2,137.|$|E
2500|$|The Concord-based VAM American {{started as}} the [...] "second generation" [...] {{of the economy}} and luxury line of {{intermediate}} VAM compacts, the first generation being the 1975-1977 Hornet-based Americans. The 1978 base models were called [...] "American sedan" [...] and [...] "Camioneta American" [...] by VAM, despite that they had no designation. The standard [...] I6 engine came with a single-barrel carburetor and three-speed manual transmission with column-shift on the wagon and four-door, or a floor-shift on the two-door. A three-speed automatic transmission was optional with column-mounted shifter in all three body styles; and ordering it included power steering, bumper guards, and the heater without extra cost in both sedan models. As for the base wagon, which had the heater regularly as standard, got a full high-trim upgrade included with the order of the automatic transmission. The four-door sedan and wagon featured a front bench seat, while the two-door sedan included low-back individual non-reclining seats. Standard were non-power brakes with front disks and rear drums, front sway bar, <b>manual</b> <b>steering,</b> a 3.31:1 rear differential gear ratio, plain blacked-out dashboard, [...] dual speedometer, fixed three-point front seatbelts (retractable on base wagon), inside hood release, front ashtray, lighter, locking glove box, AM radio with antenna, rear ashtrays, round dome light, electric two-speed wipers, electric washers, flat volcano hubcaps with exposed lug nuts, [...] "American" [...] fender emblems, [...] "4.2" [...] rear quarter emblems, manual driver's side remote mirror, base steering wheel and roof rack (wagon only). Aside from the aforementioned automatic transmission, factory optional equipment included power brakes, power steering (with manual transmission), stiffer springs and shocks, wheel trim rings, sports steering wheel, luxury steering wheel, passenger's side remote mirror, tinted windshield, parcel shelf (standard on wagon), bright molding package, bumper guards (with manual transmission), and heater (for manual sedans).|$|E

50|$|The MP Lafer was an {{automobile}} built in Brazil by Lafer S.A. beginning in 1974. Created by Percival Lafer, a furniture manufacturer, the MP Lafer was a fiberglass-bodied two-seat roadster that took its styling cues from the classic British sports cars of the 1940s and early '50s, {{with a strong}} resemblance to the MG T-series and Morgan Plus 4. Unlike those, however, its chassis, engine, <b>manual</b> transmission, <b>steering</b> and suspension were from the Volkswagen Beetle (known as the Fusca in Brazil). Although the stock VW Type 1 four-cylinder made it somewhat underpowered, the MP Lafer became a sought-after car in its time. Approximately 4,300 were built over the MP Lafer's 16-year production span. The Lafer was available in two models—the classic MP and the more modern TI, introduced in March 1984. Some 1,000 were exported, most to Europe but some to the United States.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} types of control systems: open loop, feed-forward, and feedback. An example of a pure open loop control system is <b>manual</b> non-power-assisted <b>{{steering}}</b> of a motor car; the steering system does {{not have access to}} an auxiliary power source and does not respond to varying resistance to turning of the direction wheels; the driver must make that response without help from the steering system. In comparison, power steering has access to a controlled auxiliary power source, which depends on the engine speed. When the steering wheel is turned, a valve is opened which allows fluid under pressure to turn the driving wheels. A sensor monitors that pressure so that the valve only opens enough to cause the correct pressure to reach the wheel turning mechanism. This is feed-forward control where the output of the system, the change in direction of travel of the vehicle, plays no part in the system. See Model predictive control.|$|R
25|$|The design, {{using as}} many {{commercial}} components {{as possible to}} improve reliability {{and the rate of}} production, was standardized in 1940 and built by the Autocar Company, Diamond T Motor Company, and the White Motor Company. Offered with a choice of White 160AX or IHC Red Diamond 450 engines, the M3 was driven through a manual constant-mesh (non-synchromesh) transmission with four forward and one reverse gear, as well as a two-speed transfer case. The front suspension was leaf spring, tracks by vertical volute spring. Braking was vacuum-assisted hydraulic, <b>steering</b> <b>manual,</b> without power assist. The electrical system was 12-volt.|$|R
5000|$|In {{conventional}} cars, hydraulics {{are only}} used in brakes and power steering. In the DS {{they were also}} used for the suspension, clutch and transmission. The cheaper 1957 ID19 did have <b>manual</b> <b>steering</b> and a simplified power-braking system. An engine driven pump pressurizes the closed system to 2,400 pounds per square inch.|$|E
