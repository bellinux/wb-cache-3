Whereas in Debussy's works [...] "there is seldom anything that grows thematically or undergoes development" [...] (instead, Debussy marvels the listener with [...] "his mastery in rendering dreamy, passive moods and fleeting, restrained emotions"), Sibelius places [...] "too <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> the logical development of his musical ideas to let... them flicker out in the empty nothingness of thematic instability"; in other words, he insists that [...] "atmospheric background swallow neither action nor structure". Sibelius's impressionism is thus [...] "far more... active" [...] than Debussy's.|$|E

500|$|The {{next issue}} to be {{addressed}} was the main armament. The General Staff decided in March 1912 to retain the [...] gun of the Bretagne class. They chose the new quadruple turret and advocated an armament of twelve guns in two quadruple and two double turrets. If this arrangement placed too <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> the bow and stern, the arrangement of five twin turrets as in the Bretagne-class battleships would be substituted. In April 1912, the Naval Supreme Council accepted the latter design, unless the quadruple turret could be readied by the time construction was scheduled to begin. The armor layout of the Bretagne class was to be retained, though {{an increase in the}} thickness of the main belt was to be effected if possible.|$|E
500|$|On {{the day it}} {{was first}} tested the water was allowed to flow in, but one of the arches began to buckle under the weight. Brindley, {{overcome}} with anxiety, retired to his bed at the Bishop Blaize tavern in nearby Stretford. Gilbert, realising that Brindley had placed too <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> the sides of the arch, removed the clay and laid layers of straw and freshly puddled clay; when the water was allowed to flow in again the masonry held firm. According to a statement by Francis Egerton, 8th Earl of Bridgewater printed in 1820, his uncle, the duke, had told him that there was a distortion of one of the arches, and that Gilbert had addressed the problem by placing [...] more weight on the crown of the arch and less on the haunches. The arch was then covered with straw and allowed to stand until the following spring, when the mortar was set and the arch had become stable, but its curve remained irregular.|$|E
500|$|Researchers have {{variously}} {{suggested that}} Hitler suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, skin lesions, irregular heartbeat, coronary sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, syphilis, giant-cell arteritis, and tinnitus. In a report {{prepared for the}} OSS in 1943, Walter C. Langer of Harvard University described Hitler as a [...] "neurotic psychopath". In his 1977 book , historian Robert G. L. Waite proposes that he suffered from borderline personality disorder. Historians Henrik Eberle and Hans-Joachim Neumann consider that while he suffered {{from a number of}} illnesses including Parkinson's disease, Hitler did not experience pathological delusions and was always fully aware of, and therefore responsible for, his decisions. Theories about Hitler's medical condition are difficult to prove, and placing too <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> them may have the effect of attributing many of the events and consequences of Nazi Germany to the possibly impaired physical health of one individual. Kershaw feels that it is better to take a broader view of German history by examining what social forces led to the Nazi dictatorship and its policies rather than to pursue narrow explanations for the Holocaust and World WarII based on only one person.|$|E

The bombardment lasted for over two hours, during which time the force made six passes across the mouth of Kamaishi's harbor and fired 802 [...] shells, 728 [...] shells and 825 [...] shells. While most of the shells landed within the grounds of the ironworks, the concussion from their explosions caused kitchen fires to break out across Kamaishi. The resulting smoke prevented US Navy aircraft from being able to support or spot for the warships, which continued to fire accurately on predetermined targets. No Japanese aircraft or coastal guns responded to this bombardment. Allied aircraft photographed the ironworks following the attack, but photo interpreters underestimated {{the extent to which they}} had been damaged. This was one of the first times that the Americans had used aerial photography to assess damage from a naval bombardment, and the interpreters placed too <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> the fact that none of the ironworks' buildings had been destroyed. The Allies learned after the war that the ironworks had been extensively damaged and forced to cease production for a period. This resulted in a loss of the equivalent of four weeks of pig iron production and two-and-a-half months of coke production. Five Allied prisoners of war were killed by the bombardment.|$|E
500|$|Until its {{discovery}} and importation from the New World, tobacco was unknown to western medicine. [...] Europeans were not {{ignorant of the}} effects of smoke; incense has been used since antiquity, and the psychoactive effects of burning hemp seed was well known by the Scythians and Thracians. [...] The ancient Greek physician Hippocrates recommended the inhalation of smoke for [...] "female diseases" [...] as did Pliny the Elder, as a cure for coughs. [...] The Native Americans from whom the first western explorers learnt about tobacco used the leaf for a variety of purposes, including religious worship, but Europeans soon became aware that the Americans also used tobacco for medicinal purposes. [...] The French diplomat Jean Nicot used a tobacco poultice as an analgesic, and Nicol√°s Monardes advocated tobacco as a treatment for a long list of diseases, such as cancer, headaches, respiratory problems, stomach cramps, gout, intestinal worms and female diseases. [...] Contemporaneous medical science placed <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> humorism, and for a short period tobacco became a panacea. [...] Its use was mentioned in pharmacopoeia as a tool against cold and somnolence brought on by particular medical afflictions, its effectiveness explained by its ability to soak up moisture, to warm parts of the body, and to therefore maintain the equilibrium so important to a healthy person. [...] In an attempt to discourage disease tobacco was also used to fumigate buildings.|$|E

2500|$|Nearly {{two years}} later, Carey was named referee of Super Bowl XLII. On working the NFL's {{championship}} game, Carey {{said it was}} a [...] "personal honor" [...] and understood the historical significance of being the first African American referee. On the significance of the event, he {{said it was a}} [...] "great sign of the evolution of our society that all barriers are eroding". During the fourth quarter, Carey's judgment was a factor in one of the important plays of the game. On third down, with just over a minute left in regulation, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning received the snap in a shotgun formation and looked to pass the ball. New England Patriots defenders Richard Seymour, Jarvis Green, and Adalius Thomas grabbed and attempted to tackle Manning. Manning escaped the two defenders and threw a 32-yard pass to wide receiver David Tyree. Under NFL rules, officials are required to stop play when a player is [...] "in the grasp and control" [...] of the defense. Carey determined that [...] "grasp and control" [...] was never achieved since Manning's forward momentum did not stop. Speaking about the play, Carey said, [...] "I anticipated a sack. I didn't assume that was going to happen, but rarely do you see a quarterback escape when he's got that <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> his back and being dragged by two or three guys who had a hold of him.
