5|$|Ely Hall is {{the home}} of Vassar's Earth Science and Geography Department. The A. Scott Warthin, Jr. Museum of Geology and Natural History resides on the building's first floor, {{showcasing}} a collection of fossils, rocks, minerals, and scientific equipment collected over the entirety of Vassar's history. The Museum is free and open on weekdays during the academic year from 9 am until 5 pm. Ely also hosts several laboratories, dedicated to the study of earth materials, paleoclimatology, clastic sedimentology, and geophysics. Within Ely, there are also classrooms, a GIS laboratory, and a <b>map</b> <b>collection.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} remained substantially unchanged until {{vacated by}} the hospital in 1930. After the freehold was purchased by Lord Rothermere, the wings were demolished to leave the original central portion (with the dome now appearing disproportionately tall) and Smirke's later wings. When the museum moved into the building in 1936 {{the ground floor of}} the central portion was occupied by the principal art gallery, with the east wing housing the Naval gallery and the west wing the Army gallery. The Air Force gallery was housed in the former theatre. The first floor comprised further art galleries (including rooms dedicated to Sir William Orpen and Sir John Lavery), a gallery on women's war work, and exhibits relating to transport and signals. The first floor also housed the museum's photograph collection. The second floor housed the museum's library in its west wing, and in the east wing the <b>map</b> <b>collection</b> and stored pictures and drawings. This division of exhibits by service, and by civil or military activity, persisted until a wide-ranging redisplay of the galleries from the 1960s onwards. In September 1972 the building received Grade II listed building status.|$|E

25|$|The Jewish National and University Library is {{the central}} and largest library of the Hebrew University {{and one of the}} most {{impressive}} book and manuscript collections in the world. It is also the oldest section of the university. Founded in 1892 as a world center for the preservation of books relating to Jewish thought and culture, it assumed the additional functions of a general university library in 1920. Its collections of Hebraica and Judaica are the largest in the world. It houses all materials published in Israel, and attempts to acquire all materials published in the world related to the country. It possesses over five million books and thousands of items in special sections, many of which are unique. Among these are the Albert Einstein Archives, Hebrew manuscripts department, Eran Laor <b>map</b> <b>collection,</b> Edelstein science collection, Gershom Scholem collection, and a collection of Maimonides' manuscripts and early writings.|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to afford}} the asking price, and {{concerned}} that, ostensibly because of the former private owner's tax concerns, Witten refused to reveal the provenance of the map, Yale contacted another alumnus, Paul Mellon, who agreed to buy it (for a price later stated to be about $300,000) and donate it to the university {{if it could be}} authenticated. Recognizing its potential importance as the earliest map unambiguously showing America, Mellon insisted that its existence be kept secret until a scholarly book had been written about it. Even the three authors of the book were chosen from among the small number of people who had seen the map before Mellon bought it—two British Museum curators and Marston. Only one of them, Dr. Raleigh Ashlin Skelton, keeper of the Museum's <b>map</b> <b>collection,</b> had significant expertise relevant to the problems posed by the map (his colleague George Painter, the first person to whom Davis had shown the map in 1957, was brought in for the transcription and translation of the Relation) and the secrecy almost completely ruled out consultation with specialists. Witten did his best to help during this period, not only answering the authors' questions, but offering suggestions of his own. After years of study, the proofs of the book, The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation, were ready by the end of 1964, and Mellon donated the map to Yale. The book was published, and the map revealed to the world, the day before Columbus Day, 1965. Many academic reviewers of the book took the opportunity to point out evidence that called the map's authenticity into question, so a year later, a Vinland Map Conference was held at the Smithsonian Institution, during which further significant questions were asked, particularly of Witten, who gave very straightforward and helpful answers; but, the proceedings were not published for another five years.|$|E
500|$|During {{this period}} Mercator was {{in contact with}} the Franciscan monk Monachus who lived in the monastery of Mechelen. He was a {{controversial}} figure who, from time to time, was in conflict with the church authorities because of his humanist outlook and his break from Aristotelian views of the world: his own views of geography were based on investigation and observation. Mercator must have been impressed by Monachus, his <b>map</b> <b>collection</b> and the famous globe that he had prepared for Jean Carondelet, the principal advisor of CharlesV. The globe was constructed by the Leuven goldsmith Gaspar van der Heyden (Gaspar a Myrica c1496–c1549) with whom Mercator would be apprenticed. These encounters may well have provided the stimulus to put aside his problems with theology and commit himself to geography. Later he would say, [...] "Since my youth, geography has been for me the primary subject of study. I liked not only the description of the Earth but the structure of the whole machinery of the world." ...|$|E

Robson writes that [...] "without her Waikato may never have had a Map Library or, at least, it would have been only a much poorer one", and Bedford adds that [...] "her passion for maps has kept a tradition of cartography very much alive for almost 40 years in Waikato's Geography Department". Bedford also states that [...] "her publications are renowned for the meticulous and innovative cartography", and that her skills in this area were put to good use in her service on the editorial committee for the New Zealand Historical Atlas (1991–1997).|$|E
