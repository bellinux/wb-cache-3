5|$|Near its {{junction}} {{with the}} River Arun, the river loops {{to the south}} in a large <b>meander.</b> A cut ran {{from the start of}} the <b>meander</b> to join the Arun above the original junction, with a lock towards the downstream end. The <b>meander</b> fed Hardham Corn Mill. A lock bypassed the mill and the millstream, to enable boats to reach the Hardham Tunnel cut, which headed south from a junction above the mill. The Tunnel Branch was destroyed by the construction of a water treatment works, and the modern weir near the mouth is much closer to the junction than the lock was.|$|E
40|$|River <b>meanders</b> {{present the}} most {{frequent}} planform of lowland rivers. Their formation on poljes mostly depends on flood water regime.

40|$|Due to a typhoon and a {{stationary}} rain front, record amounts of rain fell in September 2011, {{and the largest}} class of discharge in recorded history was observed in the Otofuke River of eastern Hokkaido in Japan, and extensive bank erosion occurred {{in various parts of}} the river channel. Damages were especially serious in the middle reaches, where part of a dike was washed out. The results of a post-flood survey suggested that the direct cause of the dike breach was lateral advance of the bank erosion associated with the development of <b>meandering</b> channels. As the related development mechanism and predominant factors have not yet been clarified, this remains a priority from the viewpoint of disaster prevention. A past study on the development of <b>meandering</b> channels was reported by Shimizu et al. (1996). In this study, the <b>meandering</b> channel development process was reproduced using a slope failure model that linked bank erosion with bed changes. The study attempted to clarify the <b>meandering</b> development mechanism in the disaster and its predominant factors by using this model. The analysis properly reproduced the characteristics of the post-flood <b>meandering</b> waveforms. Therefore, it is suggested that the development of <b>meandering</b> during the flood attributed to the propagation of <b>meandering</b> downstream, which is triggered by the <b>meandering</b> flow from the <b>meandering</b> channel in the upstream, which also suggests that this propagated <b>meandering</b> then caused a gradual increase of <b>meandering</b> amplitude accompanied by bank erosion in the recession period of the flood. © Author(s) 2014.

5|$|On-farm {{factories}} in the Deloraine area made cheese, mostly cheddar, during the early 20th century. Cheese {{was made in the}} <b>Meander</b> area from at least 1908 when a factory opened on the Cheshunt estate. The last of the area's factories closed prior to World War II. <b>Meander</b> had a resident blacksmith from c.1876, though blacksmithing had been done on private properties before this. Blacksmithing as a separate industry continued into the early 20th century. Prompted by new legislation in the 1980s, that enforced hygiene standards in animal slaughtering, a slaughter-house was opened in <b>Meander.</b> It was registered in 1986. Before this butchering was a more informal or back-yard industry.|$|E
5|$|School ran {{at various}} times at localities near <b>Meander</b> including: Montana; Golden Valley; Western Creek; and Jacky's Marsh. A school opened on a {{property}} known as Cheshunt in 1907, as the Springdale School. In 1919 it was moved to Montana, and renamed Montana School in 1923. The building burned down December 1926. During rebuilding some students were educated at the Montana Baptist church, others at the school at <b>Meander.</b> The school closed in 1944, by which time there were only seven students. The Montana school building was moved {{to be part of}} the <b>Meander</b> School in 1947–48. A school was run at Golden Valley from 1870 to 1945, initially as a 1/2-day school. During most of its life it had around 30 students. After closing the school building was relocated to <b>Meander</b> School. Western Creek had a school from 1893 to 1938. After it closed some students attended Meander's school, but others moved to schools at Mole Creek and Deloraine. Unlike other schools in the area the building was not moved to <b>Meander</b> but instead to Mole Creek's school. Children from Jacky's Marsh travelled to <b>Meander</b> for schooling until 1900 when the Jacky's Marsh school opened. The school was closed 1910–22 and finally closed in 1937. The school building was moved to <b>Meander</b> c1940. From the 1940s school buses brought children from Jacky's Marsh, Montana, Huntsman, Western creek and other nearby areas.|$|E

40|$|The {{devices that}} are {{variations}} of inter-and intracoupled <b>meandering</b> optical waveguides are proposed as the lightwave circuit elements that exhibit distributed feedback. A preliminary {{transfer matrix method}} analysis is applied in frequency domain, taking the coupling purely directional and with constant coefficient on geometrically symmetric and anti-symmetric devices. The <b>meandering</b> loop mirror is the building block of all <b>meandering</b> waveguide based lightwave circuit elements. The simplest uncoupled <b>meandering</b> distributed feedback structure exhibits Rabi splitting in the transmittance spectrum. The symmetric and antisymmetric coupled <b>meandering</b> distributed feedback geometries can be utilized as band-pass, Fano, or Lorentzian filters or Rabi splitters. <b>Meandering</b> waveguide distributed feedback structures {{with a variety of}} spectral responses can be designed for a variety of lightwave circuit element functions and can be implemented with generality due to the analytic approach taken...|$|R
40|$|River <b>meandering</b> {{has been}} {{successfully}} modelled using vector based methods, but these cannot simulate multiple or braided channels. Conversely, cellular braided river models fail to replicate <b>meandering.</b> This paper describes a new method to simulate river <b>meandering</b> within a cellular model (CAESAR). A novel technique for determining bend radius of curvature on a cell by cell basis is described, that importantly allows regional information on bend curvature {{to be transferred to}} local points. This local curvature is then used to drive <b>meandering</b> and lateral erosion through two methods. Key difficulties are identified, including the deposition of material on point bars and cut off development, but the method illustrates how <b>meandering</b> can be integrated within a cellular framework. This demonstrates the potential to produce a single model that can incorporate both <b>meandering</b> and braiding...|$|R
40|$|Braided rivers are {{relatively}} simple to produce in the laboratory, whereas dynamic <b>meandering</b> rivers {{have not been}} sustained beyond initial bend formation. <b>Meandering</b> is theoretically explained by bend instability growing from planimetric perturbation, which convects downstream. In this study, we experimentally tested the importance of upstream perturbation and chute cutoff development in the evolution and dynamics of a <b>meandering</b> channel pattern. The initial straight channel had a transversely moving upstream inlet point and silt-sized silica flour {{was added to the}} sediment feed to allow floodplain formation. We obtained a dynamic <b>meandering</b> river with scroll bars. Bend growth was alternated by chute cutoffs that formed across the point bars. <b>Meandering</b> was maintained as one channel was disconnected by a plug bar. The curvature at the chute bifurcation transported sediment and build a new floodplain, while the other channel widens. At the end of the experiment, the fluvial plain exhibited a <b>meandering</b> channel, point bars, chutes and abandoned and partially filled channels with a slightly cohesive floodplain surface similar to natural <b>meandering</b> gravel bed rivers. We conclude that the necessary and sufficient conditions for dynamic <b>meandering</b> gravel bed river are a sustained dynamic upstream perturbation and floodplain formation...|$|R
5|$|Meander's Australian rules {{football}} club {{was formed in}} 1923, playing in the Chudleigh Association, and won the Association premiership in 1931. The club stopped playing during World War II. After the war they moved to the Central Association, and later the Deloraine Association. From 1966–76 {{they were part of}} the Esk Association before returning to Deloraine. The club closed in 1982 due to a lack of both players and support from locals. Some footballers from <b>Meander</b> were noted for their later success in the game. Carl Watson played in the <b>Meander</b> club, before moving to the Latrobe Seniors. He played for Richmond 1925–31 and Essendon for his final Victorian Football League season in 1932. Ron McGowan was at <b>Meander</b> School in the 1950s. He played in various clubs in Tasmania before starting with Footscray where he played 120 games from 1967. He later played with South Adelaide, and spent time as Footscray's selection committee's chairman.|$|E
5|$|The first {{church in}} <b>Meander</b> was a Methodist chapel, {{built on the}} corner of Main Road and East <b>Meander</b> Road on land donated by a local family. It opened in 1886; {{construction}} was most likely funded by local Methodists. Until subsequent churches were built it was used by all Christian denominations. Meander's Methodist church became part of the Uniting Church in Australia in 1976, along with many other Methodist churches. The church continued after this to be used by other denominations. It hosted its last service 20 May 1984 and the building was subsequently sold.|$|E
5|$|The first {{community}} hall at <b>Meander</b> {{was built}} in 1914. It was built by local resident Fred Bowman, who maintained it until 1945 when responsibility {{was taken over by}} a local committee. Locals decided, in 1952, to build a new hall. Funding from the hall came from, competitions, dances and the growing of peas for sale. The hall opened 3 December 1954 and was physically joined to the original c.1957. The Road from Deloraine to <b>Meander</b> was sealed in 1964, an event of some note that was celebrated with a gymkhana and fair. Mains electricity reached <b>Meander</b> in 1952 when power, supplied by the Hydro-Electric Commission, was switched on in Meander's township area December 1952. Meander's street lights were first turned on 12 November 1971.|$|E
30|$|The {{descriptive}} sedimentological terminologies for <b>meandering</b> channel {{processes in}} this study are mainly from Harms et al. (1975), whereas the hierarchical descriptive terminologies for small-scale bedding structures are derived from Collinson et al. (1982). On this basis, the architecture of a <b>meandering</b> belt was recognised along the longitudinal <b>meandering</b> belt instead of the transverse, which is an efficient way to reconstruct the subsurface reservoir architecture (Ghinassi et al. 2014). In particular, ancient <b>meandering</b> channels are more difficult to identify because they are buried thousands of metres deep. Some important terminologies used {{in this study}} are explained before dissecting the sedimentary structure of the <b>meandering</b> belt.|$|R
30|$|<b>Meandering</b> bend {{expansion}} (Figs.  4 a, 12 c) increases curvature, {{flow path}} length, and sinuosity, and the bend apex migrates {{away from the}} <b>meandering</b> belt axis (Jackson 1976; Ghinassi et al. 2013). <b>Meandering</b> bend translation (Figs.  4 b, 12 b) was characterised by a bend apex parallel to the <b>meandering</b> belt axis without an obvious change in sinuosity aside from the translation and expansion mode. On the other hand, <b>meandering</b> bend rotation (Figs.  4 d–f, 12 a) was characterised by increasing bend asymmetry, an apex shifting away from the <b>meandering</b> belt axis, and a nonlinear migration path. The upstream point bar crawled on or was intercalated with the downstream point bar, which indicated strong expansion of the <b>meandering</b> belt (Fig.  12 c). Furthermore, more upstream point bar deposits from the <b>meandering</b> belt axis were well-preserved during continuous expansion (Fig.  12 d). During <b>meandering</b> channel transport and deposition, {{almost all of the}} upstream bar suffered from partial erosion, leading to thalweg trajectories of the expansion mode migrating downstream. In contrast, those of the translation mode migrated upstream, indicating the paleo-current direction (Fig.  12). The continuous expansion and rotation mode could have led to higher frequency cut-offs because the expansion mode tended to form cut-offs. Moreover, the rotation mode was more prone to form chute channels, which may form a branch channel within a certain period of time.|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the heavy}} {{forestation}} in the area, sawmilling was an important and early industry, starting in the 1830s. In the early 20th century, there were around 20 sawmills in <b>Meander</b> and the surrounding localities. Due to a move towards closer settlement—smaller land plots and resulting greater population density—demand for timber in <b>Meander</b> increased and new sawmills were built in <b>Meander</b> in the 1910s and 1920s. Some of these mills continued into the late 20th century. Sawmilling later declined, partly {{due to lack of}} timber. Timberworld is the only remaining sawmill, though this is not its only business. It opened in 1985 as a sawmill supplying local Australian blackwood, myrtle beach and Blackheart Sassafras, originally operating from the former Baptist Church building. From 1990 it was owned and run by Kerin Booth and Kim Booth and it relocated to the former site of the Cummings Bros sawmill. Kim Booth, leader of the Tasmanian Greens, later passed management of the company to his son, Bronte. At one time Timberworld employed 30 people. The company now focuses on supply of prefabricated homes.|$|E

40|$|<b>Meanders</b> form {{a set of}} {{combinatorial}} problems {{concerned with}} the enumeration of self-avoiding loops crossing a line through a given number of points, $n$. <b>Meanders</b> are considered distinct up to any smooth deformation leaving the line fixed. We use a recently developed algorithm, based on transfer matrix methods, to enumerate plane <b>meanders.</b> This allows us to calculate the number of closed <b>meanders</b> up to $n= 48 $, the number of open <b>meanders</b> up to $n= 43 $, {{and the number of}} semi-meanders up to $n= 45 $. The analysis of the series yields accurate estimates of both the critical point and critical exponent, and shows that a recent conjecture for the exact value of the semi-meander critical exponent is unlikely to be correct, while the conjectured exponent value for closed and open <b>meanders</b> is not inconsistent with the results from the analysis.

30|$|The {{identification}} of a single bend from a complex compound <b>meandering</b> belt contains uncertainty due {{to the complexity of}} generations among the bends, and therefore estimation and reconstruction of a subsurface <b>meandering</b> belt are difficult.

5|$|The {{origins of}} the composition, techniques, layout, and style of Delian mosaics {{can be found in}} 5th-century BC pebble mosaics of Olynthus in the Chalcidice of {{northern}} Greece, with mosaics positioned in the center of cement floors and utilizing garland, <b>meander,</b> and wave patterns around a centralized motif or figured scene. This design scheme {{is similar to that of}} 4th-century BC mosaics of Pella in Macedonia, although the pebble mosaics there employ a wider range of colors to create the effects of volume. The transition from pebble mosaics to more complex tessellated mosaics perhaps originated in Hellenistic-Greek Sicily during the 3rd century BC, developed at sites such as Morgantina and Syracuse. Much like Olynthus, mosaics of Morgantina contain the garland, wave, and <b>meander</b> patterns, although the latter was finally executed with perspective.|$|E
