5|$|After {{his playing}} career at Yale ended in 1882, Camp was {{employed}} by the New Haven Clock Company {{until his death in}} 1925. Though no longer a player, he remained a fixture at annual rules <b>meetings</b> <b>for</b> most of his life, and he personally selected an annual All-American team every year from 1889 through 1924. The Walter Camp Football Foundation continues to select All-American teams in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scientists}} {{of the day}} recoiled to find that Cope's feud with Marsh had become front-page news. Those closest to the scientific fields under discussion, geology and vertebrate paleontology, certainly winced, particularly as they found themselves quoted, mentioned, or misspelled. The feud was not news to them, for it had lurked at their scientific <b>meetings</b> <b>for</b> two decades. Most of them had already taken sides.|$|E
5|$|The yamen in {{the heart}} of the City was also a major social centre, a place for {{residents}} to talk, have tea or watch television, and to take classes such as calligraphy. The Old People's Centre also held religious <b>meetings</b> <b>for</b> Christians and others. Other religious institutions included the Fuk Tak and Tin Hau temples, which were used for a combination of Buddhist, Taoist, and animist practices.|$|E
50|$|Within the Religious Society of Friends, a clerk {{is someone}} {{responsible}} for various administrative functions within a <b>meeting</b> <b>for</b> worship for church affairs or <b>meeting</b> <b>for</b> worship for business. The clerk {{is responsible for}} recording the discernment which a <b>meeting</b> <b>for</b> worship for church affairs has reached, in a minute, and is responsible for sending and receiving correspondence {{on behalf of the}} meeting. Within some branches of the Religious Society of Friends, the clerk may also create an agenda and may facilitate the meeting.|$|R
25|$|Governance and {{decision}} making is conducted at a special <b>meeting</b> <b>for</b> worship—often called a <b>meeting</b> <b>for</b> worship with a concern <b>for</b> business or <b>meeting</b> <b>for</b> worship for church affairs at which all members can attend, as in a Congregational church. Quakers consider {{this to be a}} form of worship, conducted in the manner of <b>meeting</b> <b>for</b> worship. They believe this is the gathering of believers who wait upon the Lord to discover God's will, believing that they are not making their own decisions. They seek to understand God's will for the religious community, via the actions of the Holy Spirit within the meeting.|$|R

5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the Portuguese dogfish was published by Portuguese zoologists José Vicente Barbosa du Bocage and Félix António de Brito Capello, in an 1864 issue of Proceedings of the General <b>Meetings</b> <b>for</b> Scientific Business of the Zoological Society of London. They created the new genus Centroscymnus for this shark, and gave it the specific epithet coelolepis, derived from the Greek koilos ("hollow") and lepis ("fish scale") and referring {{to the structure of}} the dermal denticles. The type specimen, caught off Portugal, has since been destroyed in a fire.|$|E
5|$|The two {{principal}} drafters and {{architects of the}} covenant of the League of Nations were Lord Robert Cecil (a British diplomat), and Jan Smuts (a South African statesman). Smuts' proposals included {{the creation of a}} Council of the great powers as permanent members and a non-permanent selection of the minor states. He also proposed the creation of a Mandate system for captured colonies of the Central Powers during the war. Cecil focused on the administrative side, and proposed annual Council meetings and quadrennial <b>meetings</b> <b>for</b> the Assembly of all members. He also argued for a large and permanent secretariat to carry out the League's administrative duties.|$|E
5|$|To Heart 2 {{development}} originally {{began as}} a collaborative effort for the PlayStation 2 between the Osaka and Tokyo studios of Aquaplus. During one of the staff <b>meetings</b> <b>for</b> the partnered project, To Heart 2 was conceived when a staff member jokingly mentioned {{the possibility of a}} sequel for the original To Heart. Production began shortly after once the team realized the popularity and success of the forerunner. Naoya Shimokawa, the president of Aquaplus, produced the resulting project, and Tsutomu Washimi served as the game's director.|$|E

5|$|Founded in 1885, the Círculo de Trabajadores {{organization}} {{concentrated on}} educational and cultural activities, hosting a secular school for 500 poor students and <b>meetings</b> <b>for</b> workers' groups. The next year, {{leaders of the}} Círculo (with Enrique Creci at the head) formed an aid committee {{to raise funds for}} the legal troubles of eight Chicago anarchists who had been charged with murder in connection with the Haymarket affair. Within a month and a half, the committee had raised approximately US$1,500 for the cause. In addition, a few days prior to the anarchists executions, the Círculo organized a demonstration of 2,000 people in Havana to protest the state's decision to execute the Americans. The Círculo and El Productor were both fined - the paper for an editorial written by Roig San Martín about the executions, and the Círculo for displaying a painting that commemorated the execution. The colonial government also prohibited the demonstrations that would be held every year on anniversary of the execution.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{sessions}} and <b>meetings</b> <b>for</b> No Doubt's third studio album Tragic Kingdom (1995) began in 1993 between members Eric Stefani, Gwen Stefani, Tony Kanal, Tom Dumont, Adrian Young, and musician Gary Angle. The material produced with Angle was hugely rejected by Interscope Records' officials, {{and had the}} members work with producer Matthew Wilder instead. Upset with working with someone outside the band, Eric eventually stopped recording with the band, and encouraged the remaining members to write the group's songs, as he felt threatened when he did so. After Kanal broke off his seven-year relationship with Gwen, both of them wrote several more songs, until there was enough material for an album. The single's inspiration came when Kanal was having a fight with Stefani, his then-girlfriend, through the bathroom door of his parents' house in Yorba Linda, California; Stefani later revamped the lyrics to discuss her breakup with Kanal.|$|E
5|$|A {{similar story}} was {{published}} about Catherine Babington, first in her obituary, in Shelby, North Carolina, in 1886, {{then in a}} short book by her son outlining her masonic career. Hailed as the only female mason in the United States, {{she is said to}} have obtained the secrets at the age of 16 by hiding in her uncles' lodge room in Princess, Kentucky. Having lost her father at an early age, she spent much of her childhood at her grandfather's house, where she became a favourite of her uncles. They attended a lodge in an unused chapel above Catherine's school-room, which she often helped them clean. As a teenager, Catherine Sweet (Babington being her married name) attended lodge <b>meetings</b> <b>for</b> a year, hiding in the old pulpit, finally being discovered when one of her uncles returned unexpectedly for a rifle he had left in the ante-room. Being questioned by the lodge, it was discovered that she had committed much of the ritual to memory, and was, like Anderson, made a mason to swear her to secrecy, but in this instance not admitted to membership of the lodge. The sole source of the story is her son, and much of the detail remains unconfirmed. There is no account or recollection of such a lodge room in or around Princess.|$|E
