40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new micro-scale model for solidification of eutectic alloys. The model {{is based on}} the enthalpy method and simulates the growth of adjacent alpha and beta phases from a melt of eutectic composition in a two-dimensional Eulerian framework. The evolution of the two phases is obtained from the solution of volume averaged energy and species transport equations which are formulated using the nodal enthalpy and concentration potential values. The three phases are tracked using the beta-phase fraction and the liquid fraction values in all the computational nodes. Solutal convection flow field in the domain is obtained from the solution of volume-averaged momentum and continuity equations. The governing equations are solved using a coupled explicit-implicit scheme. The model is qualitatively validated with Jackson-Hunt theory. Results show expected eutectic growth pattern and proper species transfer and diffusion field ahead of the interface. Capabilities of the model such as lamella width selection, division of lamella into thinner lamellae and the presence of solutal convection are successfully demonstrated. The present model can potentially be incorporated into the existing framework of enthalpy based micro-scale dendritic solidification models thus leading to an efficient generalized <b>microstructure</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>model.</b> (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Abstract: A fully coupled {{thermomechanical}} {{finite element}} analysis of the friction-stir welding (FSW) process developed in the authors ’ previous work is combined with the basic physical metallurgy of Ti– 6 Al– 4 V to predict/assess the structural response of FSW joints. A close exam-ination of the experimental results reported in the open literature reveals that {{in most cases the}} heat-affected zone (HAZ) of the weld possesses the most inferior properties and tends to con-trol the overall structural performance of the weld. Taking this observation into account, a <b>microstructure</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>model</b> is developed and parameterized for the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V material residing in the HAZ. Specifically, this model addresses the problem of temporal evolution of the globular a-phase particles located within prior b-phase grains (the dominant microstructural parameter in the HAZ) during the FSW process. Next this model is combined with the well-established property versus microstructure correlations in Ti– 6 Al– 4 V in order to predict the overall structural performance of the weld. The results obtained are found to be in reasonably good agreement with their experimental counterparts, suggesting that the present computa-tional approach may be used to guide the selection of FSW process parameters in order to optimize the structural performance of FSW joints (at least while they are controlled by the HAZ-material microstructure/properties) ...|$|E

Understanding the high-temperature deformation characteristics and microstructural evolution is still of interest to many. It is known that the service performance and hot-flow behavior of this alloy are a strong function of the microstructure, particularly the grain size. To develop precise <b>microstructure</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>models</b> and foresee the final microstructure, {{it is important to understand}} how and under which forming conditions softening and precipitation processes occur concurrently.

While cylindrical compression tests were employed to observe the hot-flow behavior, the precipitation behavior and other microstructural phenomena such as particle coarsening were tracked via hardness measurements. A precipitation–temperature–time (PTT) diagram was reported, and modeling of the flow curves via hyperbolic sine model was discussed in the light of the PTT behavior.

However, in most <b>microstructure</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>models,</b> the simple area strains (natural logarithm of the area reduction ratio) multiplied by a constant have been used to compute pass-by-pass evolution of austenite grain size (AGS) in rod (or bar) rolling, without any verification. The strains at a given pass play a crucial role in determining the recrystallization behavior (static or dynamic). In this study, an analytical model that calculates the pass-by-pass strain and strain rate in rod rolling has been developed and verified by conducting four-pass (oval–round) bar and plate rolling experiments. Numerical simulations have then been carried out for the four-pass rolling sequence using the area strain model and the new analytical model, focusing on the effect of the method for calculating the strain on the recrystallization behavior and evolution of AGS. The AGS predicted was compared with those obtained from hot torsion tests. It is shown that the analytical model developed in this study is more appropriate in the analysis of bar (or rod) rolling. It was found that the recrystallization behavior and evolution of AGS during this process were influenced significantly by the calculation method for the deformation parameters (strain and strain rate). The pass-by-pass strain obtained from the simple area strain model is inadequate to be used as an input to the equations for recrystallization and AGS evolution under these rolling conditions. <br /...|$|R

This work features a pysically based plasticity model coupled with a <b>microstructure</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>model</b> for the titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. A thermally driven microstructure model is used to derive the evolution of the non-equilibrium compositions of α-phases and β-phase. Addition of material is done by activation of elements.

This is particularilly important when adding material onto thin and flexible structures. The FE-model can be used to evaluate the effect of different welding sequenses. Validation of the model is performed by comparing measured deformations, strains, residual stresses and temperatures with the computed result. The deformations, strains and temepratures are measured during the process. The deformations are measured with a LVDT-gauge at one location. The strains are measured with a strain gauge at the same location as the deformations.

The geometry flexibility of AM {{makes it possible to}} fabricate parts with complex geometry. These pieces are usually hard or expensive to produce by conventional manufacturing processes like casting or machining. Among AM processes, Selective Laser Melting (SLM) has been considered to be able to fabricate pieces with good mechanical properties as materials are totally melted and fully dense parts can be obtained. Its application to metal alloys is largely studied, while the applications to ceramics are delayed, despite their lightness, outstanding mechanical strength and excellent thermal and wear resistance. More especially the eutectic composition of alumina-zirconia with fine interpenetrated microstructures is of particular interest. A numerical model with Level Set (LS) method, applied to alumina-zirconia ceramic is proposed [1]. Considering the low absorption of material and its variation in different regions (powder, melt pool, dense ceramic) related to the local concentration of dopants, a volume heat source model based on Beer-Lambert law is proposed. Material properties are averaged between present phases depending on local temperature. The shrinkage from powder to dense matter is modeled by a compressible Newtonian law. The significant effect of surface tension is taken into account by a stable semi-implicit implementation. The evolution of bead shape is tracked by LS and a dynamic mesh adaptation is used to well represent the geometry. Several simulations are conducted to study the influence of process parameters like scanning velocity, laser power and layer thickness, on temperature field and bead shape.
