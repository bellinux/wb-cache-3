50|$|GPS {{receiver}} manufacturers design GPS receivers to use spectrum {{beyond the}} GPS-allocated band. In some cases, GPS receivers {{are designed to}} use up to 400 MHz of spectrum in either direction of the L1 frequency of 1575.42 MHz, because mobile satellite services in those regions are broadcasting from space to ground, and at power levels commensurate with mobile satellite services. However, as regulated under the FCC's Part 15 rules, GPS receivers are not warranted protection from signals outside GPS-allocated spectrum. This is why GPS operates next to the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Satellite</b> <b>Service</b> band, and also why the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Satellite</b> <b>Service</b> band operates next to GPS. The symbiotic relationship of spectrum allocation ensures that users of both bands are able to operate cooperatively and freely.|$|E

50|$|Later in the year, the {{lobbying}} group CTIA said 800 MHz {{needed to be}} added. David Donovan of The Association for Maximum Service Television said the 2 GHz band, allocated for <b>mobile</b> <b>satellite</b> <b>service,</b> was not being used after ten years, and switching to this band {{would be better than}} asking broadcasters to give up even more. Because of the digital transition, television had lost 100 of its 400 MHz. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) and the AMST commented to the FCC that the government should make maximum use of this newly available spectrum and other spectrum already allocated for wireless before asking for more, while companies that would benefit asked the government to look everywhere possible. Many broadcasters objected.|$|E
5000|$|The FCC adopted {{rules in}} February 2003 that allowed <b>Mobile</b> <b>Satellite</b> <b>Service</b> (MSS) licensees such as LightSquared to {{construct}} {{a small number of}} ancillary ground-based towers in their licensed spectrum to [...] "promote more efficient use of terrestrial wireless spectrum." [...] In those 2003 rules, the FCC stated [...] "As a preliminary matter, terrestrial Mobile Radio Service (“CMRS”) and MSS ATC are expected to have different prices, coverage, product acceptance and distribution; therefore, the two services appear, at best, to be imperfect substitutes for one another that would be operating in predominately different market segments... MSS ATC is unlikely to compete directly with terrestrial CMRS for the same customer base...". In 2004, the FCC clarified that the ground-based towers would be ancillary, noting that [...] "We will authorize MSS ATC subject to conditions that ensure that the added terrestrial component remains ancillary to the principal MSS offering. We do not intend, nor will we permit, the terrestrial component to become a stand-alone service." [...] In July 2010, the FCC stated that it expected LightSquared to use its authority to offer an integrated satellite-terrestrial service to [...] "provide mobile broadband services similar to those provided by terrestrial mobile providers and enhance competition in the mobile broadband sector." [...] However, GPS receiver manufacturers have argued that LightSquared's licensed spectrum of 1525 to 1559 MHz was never envisioned as being used for high-speed wireless broadband based on the 2003 and 2004 FCC ATC rulings making clear that the Ancillary Tower Component (ATC) would be, in fact, ancillary to the primary satellite component. To build public support of efforts to continue the 2004 FCC authorization of LightSquared's ancillary terrestrial component vs. a simple ground-based LTE service in the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Satellite</b> <b>Service</b> band, GPS receiver manufacturer Trimble Navigation Ltd. formed the [...] "Coalition To Save Our GPS." ...|$|E
