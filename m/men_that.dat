5|$|Although {{ultimately}} {{the number of}} <b>men</b> <b>that</b> joined the units of the 2nd AIF from the Militia was in fact lower than anticipated, {{a large number of}} such personnel left to seek an opportunity to serve overseas. In this time the 61st Battalion lost many of its experienced senior officers and non-commissioned officers to the 2/25th and 2/33rd Battalions that were raised in Queensland, {{as well as to the}} Royal Australian Air Force. Of note was the loss of the battalion's pipe and drum band, which joined the 2/25th en masse. A 61st Battalion officer, Major Charles Withy, also went across with them serving initially as the second in command and then later as the 2/25th's commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|Andy's and Red's {{relationship}} {{has been described as}} a non-sexual love story between two <b>men,</b> <b>that</b> few other films offer, where the friendship is not built on conducting a caper, car chases, or developing a relationship with women. Philosopher Alexander Hooke argued that Andy's and Red's true freedom is their friendship, being able to share joy and humor with each other.|$|E
5|$|As Barksdale's men pushed toward Sickles's {{headquarters}} {{near the}} Trostle barn, the general {{and his staff}} began {{to move to the}} rear, when a cannonball caught Sickles in the right leg.

Birney assumed command of the III Corps, which was soon rendered ineffective as a fighting force.|$|E

This was unusual for Missouri, as the conn was usually shifted to the fourth-level bridge during the transit at the point when a ship passed Fort Wool and Old Point Comfort. The initial course change to 060 was altered to 058 {{as a result of}} a strong ocean current that swung Missouri too far to the right during the course correction.|$|E
5|$|Before Ryan White, AIDS was {{a disease}} stigmatized as an illness {{impacting}} the gay community, {{because it was}} first diagnosed among gay <b>men.</b> <b>That</b> perception shifted as Ryan and other prominent HIV-infected people such as Magic Johnson, Arthur Ashe and the Ray brothers appeared in the media to advocate for more AIDS research and public education to address the epidemic. The U.S. Congress passed a major piece of AIDS legislation, the Ryan White CARE Act, shortly after White's death. The Act has been reauthorized twice; Ryan White Programs are the largest provider of services for people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States.|$|E

Instead, Boone promised that Boonesborough would surrender willingly to the Shawnees the following spring. Boone did not have an opportunity to tell his <b>men</b> <b>that</b> he was bluffing to prevent an immediate attack on Boonesborough, however. Boone pursued this strategy so convincingly that many of his men concluded that he had switched his loyalty to the British.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, San Francisco {{became a}} major debarkation point for {{servicemen}} stationed in the Pacific Theater. The U.S. military, which was concerned about male homosexuality, had a policy of dismissing servicemen caught in known gay establishments with blue discharges. As many of these men faced ostracism from their communities and families, they chose {{to remain in the}} city. The number of <b>men</b> <b>that</b> remained was a significant factor {{in the creation of a}} homosexual community in San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the 9th Division was {{tasked with}} {{advancing}} towards Sio, further around the coast {{on the northern}} side of the Huon Peninsula.

5|$|For some, the {{fighting}} {{did not end}} in 1918. The British Army dispatched troops to Russia during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, which {{was followed by the}} Anglo-Irish War in January 1919 and the Third Anglo-Afghan War in May 1919. The Third Afghan War was followed by the 1920 conflict between British forces and Somaliland dervishes. Those not involved in fighting or occupation duties were demobilised. The demobilisation of 4,000,000 <b>men</b> <b>that</b> followed {{the end of the war}} had, within a year, reduced the British Army to 800,000 men; by November 1920, two years after the signing of the Armistice, this figure had fallen to 370,000 men.|$|E

5|$|In early November 1822, the {{schooner}} USS Alligator, {{under the}} command of Lieutenant Allen, put into Matanzas, Cuba, intending to patrol the area as part of the United States Navy's West Indian Anti-Piracy Campaign. Upon arriving at the port, Allen discovered two Americans attempting to raise $7,000 in order to pay a ransom to a band of pirates that had captured their vessels. If the ransom was not delivered, the pirates threatened to destroy the ships and rough up their crews. Learning from these <b>men</b> <b>that</b> the pirates were holed up some 15 leagues away, Allen took the civilians aboard and decided to make an attempt at recovering their ship from the buccaneers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the account}} given by Livy, Laevinus, hearing that Apollonia was under siege, sent 2000 men {{under the command}} of Quintus Naevius Crista, to the mouth of the river.

Philip, escaping to his ships in the river, made his way over the mountains and back to Macedonia, having burned his fleet and left behind many thousands of his <b>men</b> <b>that</b> had died or been taken prisoner, along with all of his armies' possessions.
