50|$|In the {{original}} description, the Diffie-Hellman exchange by {{itself does not}} provide authentication of the communicating parties and is thus vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. Mallory may establish two distinct key exchanges, one with Alice {{and the other with}} Bob, effectively masquerading as Alice to Bob, and vice versa, allowing her to decrypt, then re-encrypt, the messages passed between them. Note that Mallory must continue to be in the <b>middle,</b> <b>transferring</b> messages every time Alice and Bob communicate. If she is ever absent, her previous presence is then revealed to Alice and Bob. They will know that all of their private conversations had been intercepted and decoded by someone in the channel.|$|R

40|$|Combined {{measurements}} of <b>middle</b> ear <b>transfer</b> function and auditory brainstem response (ABR) in live guinea pigs with middle ear effusion (MEE) {{are reported in}} this paper. The MEE model was created by injecting saline into the middle ear cavity. Vibrations of the tympanic membrane (TM), {{the tip of the}} incus, and the round window membrane (RWM) were measured with a laser vibrometer at frequencies of 0. 2 - 40 kHz when the middle ear fluid increased from 0 to 0. 2 ml (i. e., full fill of the cavity). The click and pure tone ABRs were recorded as the middle ear fluid increased. Fluid introduction reduced mobility of the TM, incus and RWM mainly at high frequencies (f> 1 kHz). The magnitude of this reduction was related to the volume of fluid. The displacement transmission ratio of the TM to incus varied with frequency and fluid level. The volume displacement ratio of the oval window to round window was approximately 1. 0 over most frequencies. Elevation of ABR thresholds and prolongation of ABR latencies were observed as fluid level increased. Reduction of TM displacement correlated well with elevation of ABR threshold at 0. 5 - 8 kHz. Alterations in the ratio of ossicular displacements before and after fluid induction are consistent with fluid-induced changes in complex ossicular motions.

30|$|The {{auditory}} {{system is}} a very complex sensory system. It can be categorized into three main parts: the outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear. Each part of the ear has characteristic roles in recognizing sound stimulus in the human brain. The middle ear consists of a tympanic membrane and three ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes), which are fixed to the temporal bone by ligaments and tendons. The <b>middle</b> ear <b>transfers</b> sound pressure fluctuations in the air into vibrational motions of the cochlear fluid in the inner ear through the impedance matching function of the middle ear between the air and cochlear fluid.|$|R
