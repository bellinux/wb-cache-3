5|$|In {{addition}} to this <b>metabolic</b> <b>diversity,</b> prokaryotes also possess a range of isozymes– different enzymes that catalyze the same reaction. For example, in E. coli, {{there are two different}} types of ubiquinol oxidase using oxygen as an electron acceptor. Under highly aerobic conditions, the cell uses an oxidase with a low affinity for oxygen that can transport two protons per electron. However, if levels of oxygen fall, they switch to an oxidase that transfers only one proton per electron, but has a high affinity for oxygen.|$|E

The extraction and analysis of metagenomic mRNA (the metatranscriptome) provides information on the regulation and expression profiles of complex communities. Because of the technical difficulties (the short half-life of mRNA, for example) {{in the collection of}} environmental RNA there have been relatively few in situ metatranscriptomic studies of microbial communities to date. While originally limited to microarray technology, metatranscriptomcs studies have made use of transcriptomics technologies to measure whole-genome expression and quantification of a microbial community, first employed in analysis of ammonia oxidation in soils.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{multiple}} research efforts, {{the current}} strategies for exploitation of lignocellulosic plant matter are {{still far from}} optimal, being hampered mostly by the difficulty of degrading the recalcitrant parts. An interesting approach is to use lignocellulose-degrading microbial communities by using different environmental sources of microbial inocula. However, it remains unclear whether the inoculum source matters for the degradation process. Here, we addressed this question by verifying the lignocellulose degradation potential of wheat (Triticum aestivum) straw by microbial consortia generated from three different microbial inoculum sources, i. e., forest soil, canal sediment and decaying wood. We selected these consortia through ten sequential-batch enrichments by dilution-to-stimulation using wheat straw as the sole carbon source. We monitored the changes in microbial composition and abundance, {{as well as their}} associated degradation capacity and enzymatic activities. Overall, the microbial consortia developed well on the substrate, with progressively-decreasing net average generation times. Each final consortium encompassed bacterial/fungal communities that were distinct in composition but functionally similar, as they all revealed high substrate degradation activities. However, we did find significant differences in the <b>metabolic</b> <b>diversities</b> per consortium: in wood-derived consortia cellobiohydrolases prevailed, in soil-derived ones beta-glucosidases, and in sediment-derived ones several activities. Isolates recovered from the consortia showed considerable <b>metabolic</b> <b>diversities</b> across the consortia. This confirmed that, although the overall lignocellulose degradation was similar, each consortium had a unique enzyme activity pattern. Clearly, inoculum source was the key determinant of the composition of the final microbial degrader consortia, yet with varying enzyme activities. Hence, in accord with Beyerinck's, "everything is everywhere, the environment selects" the source determines consortium composition...|$|R

The spatial heterogeneity of <b>metabolic</b> functional <b>diversity</b> of soil microorganisms was studied across a 30 x 40 m plot and at two soil depths (0 - 10 cm and 10 - 20 cm) in a natural, mixed broad-leaved Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) forest soil in the Changbai Mountains. In addition, we assessed {{the importance of the}} quantity and quality (indicated by labile soil organic matter fractions) of soil organic matter in small-scale structuring of soil microbial <b>metabolic</b> functional <b>diversity.</b> Microbial <b>metabolic</b> functional <b>diversity</b> was characterized based on the Biolog profile. The results showed that metabolic activity exhibited moderate spatial dependence, while functional diversity had a much stronger spatial dependence. All soil organic matter fractions including total soil organic matter, dissolved organic matter, particulate organic matter explained 15 - 27 % of the variance in microbial functional diversity in the two soil layers. Among all soil organic matter fractions, the labile dissolved organic carbon accounted for the largest amount of variation. Overall, the significant relationship between soil microorganisms and organic matter fractions allows for better understanding the ecological functions governing C cycling and microbial communities in forest ecosystems.

2500|$|Biochemically, prokaryotic {{heterotrophic}} metabolism is {{much more}} versatile than that of eukaryotic organisms, although many prokaryotes share the most basic metabolic models with eukaryotes, e. g. using glycolysis (also called EMP pathway) for sugar metabolism and the citric acid cycle to degrade acetate, producing {{energy in the form}} of ATP and reducing power in the form of NADH or quinols. [...] These basic pathways are well conserved because they are also involved in biosynthesis of many conserved building blocks needed for cell growth (sometimes in reverse direction). [...] However, many bacteria and archaea utilize alternative metabolic pathways other than glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. [...] A well-studied example is sugar metabolism via the keto-deoxy-phosphogluconate pathway (also called ED pathway) in Pseudomonas. [...] Moreover, there is a third alternative sugar-catabolic pathway used by some bacteria, the pentose phosphate pathway. The <b>metabolic</b> <b>diversity</b> and ability of prokaryotes to use a large variety of organic compounds arises from the much deeper evolutionary history and diversity of prokaryotes, as compared to eukaryotes. [...] It is also noteworthy that the mitochondrion, the small membrane-bound intracellular organelle that is the site of eukaryotic energy metabolism, arose from the endosymbiosis of a bacterium related to obligate intracellular Rickettsia, and also to plant-associated Rhizobium or Agrobacterium. [...] Therefore, {{it is not surprising that}} all mitrochondriate eukaryotes share metabolic properties with these Proteobacteria. [...] Most microbes respire (use an electron transport chain), although oxygen is not the only terminal electron acceptor that may be used. [...] As discussed below, the use of terminal electron acceptors other than oxygen has important biogeochemical consequences.|$|E

V. paradoxus also engages in mutually beneficial interactions with both bacteria and plants. The complete genome sequence of V. paradoxus S 110 is composed of 6, 754, 997 bp with 6, 279 predicted protein-coding sequences within two circular chromosomes.

Based on our findings, we suggest V. paradoxus S 110 as a potential candidate for agrobiotechnological applications, such as biofertilizer and biopesticide.

40|$|The {{functional}} {{patterns of}} microbial communities (microbial respiration, enzyme activities, functional diversity) and the relevant physico-chemical characteristics of rhizospheric soils were studied {{during the process}} of mudflat colonization by mangrove. The study site is a fringe mangrove stand located in Montabo Bay at Cayenne (French Guiana). It is characterized by different vegetation development stages dominated by an assemblage of Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa. Rhizospheric and surface soils were collected from three stations based on successional stages of mangrove colonization: pioneer (P), coppice (C), and young forest (F). The microbial functional patterns showed significant progressive shifts along the mangrove vegetation profile. The P stages, those most influenced by tide currents, were macroscopically characterized by hydro-sedimentary instability and micro-phytobenthic colonization of mudflat. This stage, characterized by low total organic carbon (TOC) content and quality, showed the lowest extracellular enzymatic activities and the highest functional <b>metabolic</b> <b>diversities.</b> TOC quality analyses by C- 13 CPMAS NMR provided evidence of progressive TOC enrichment and an increasing imprint of aboveground vegetation on C quality as succession occurs. These differences in the origin, amount, and quality of soil organic matter (SOM) of older stages exerted both a quantitative and qualitative control over microbial functional responses. This indicated the enhancement of aboveground-belowground functional linkages, leading to the expression of high decomposition activities and a functional loss and specialization of rhizospheric microbial communities...|$|R
