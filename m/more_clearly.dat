5|$|As Hitler {{went from}} being a {{stateless}} street politician to supreme leader of Nazi Germany, the responsibilities of his bodyguard expanded enormously. The bodyguard leaders in the Führer's inner circle eventually established a routine and by 1939 the roles were <b>more</b> <b>clearly</b> defined as to what duties each unit would undertake.|$|E
5|$|Delta Photos was {{dissolved}} in 1972 but other {{organizations such as}} Morten Bo's Ragnarok and Henrik Saxgren's 2. Maj sought to promote <b>more</b> <b>clearly</b> defined social and political objectives. Some photographers, such as Viggo Rivad and Krass Clement, chose instead to become freelancers.|$|E

5|$|Most sights {{have either}} active or passive {{adjustments}} for the reticle brightness, which help the shooter adapt to different lighting conditions.

5|$|The {{descriptor}} hydrated or anhydrous is {{used when}} referring to iron(III) chloride, {{to distinguish between the}} two common forms. The hexahydrate is usually given as the simplified empirical formula FeCl3⋅6H2O. It may also be given as trans-Cl⋅2H2O and the systematic name tetraaquadichloroiron(III) chloride dihydrate, which <b>more</b> <b>clearly</b> represents its structure.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Colbert left The Daily Show {{to host a}} {{spin-off}} series entitled The Colbert Report, {{a parody}} of personality-driven political pundit programs such as Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor that center largely on the personal views of their hosts. Because of this enlarged role, the personality and beliefs of the Stephen Colbert character have become <b>more</b> <b>clearly</b> defined {{over the course of}} the show, complete with a fictitious backstory that has been revealed piecemeal in short monologues accompanying a part of the program.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the same {{philosophers}} also claimed that common-sense mental states {{simply do not}} exist. But critics pointed out that eliminativists could not have it both ways: either mental states exist and will ultimately be {{explained in terms of}} lower-level neurophysiological processes or they do not. Modern eliminativists have much <b>more</b> <b>clearly</b> expressed the view that mental phenomena simply do not exist and will eventually be eliminated from people's thinking about the brain {{in the same way that}} demons have been eliminated from people's thinking about mental illness and psychopathology.|$|E

5|$|The {{respective}} remits of the National and Tate Galleries, {{which had}} long been contested by the two institutions, were <b>more</b> <b>clearly</b> defined in 1996. 1900 was established as the cut-off point for paintings in the National Gallery, and in 1997 more than 60 post-1900 paintings from the collection {{were given to the}} Tate on a long-term loan, in return for works by Gauguin and others. However, future expansion of the National Gallery may yet see the return of 20th-century paintings to its walls.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultrasound}} equipment must be of sufficiently {{high quality}} {{in order to}} give a correct image processing result, which can then provide invaluable information, mainly at the superficial level. It must be able to provide both color and Doppler imaging; technologies that developed alongside the development of ultrasound. The use of Doppler measurements which trace the echoes of the generated soundwaves received by the probe, enable the direction and the velocity of the blood flow, to be depicted. The overlay of color onto the Doppler information lets these images be seen <b>more</b> <b>clearly.</b>|$|E
5|$|With Goya we do {{not think}} of the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; but the longer I look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the <b>more</b> <b>clearly</b> I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E
50|$|When {{the city}} was {{incorporated}} in 1892, the city's north-south avenues were named for Union and Confederate generals.

5|$|As the Stranger {{continues}} {{to explore the}} island, books linking to more Ages are discovered hidden behind complex mechanisms and puzzles. The Stranger must visit each Age, find the red and blue pages hidden there, and return to Myst Island. These pages can then {{be placed in the}} corresponding books. As the Stranger adds more pages to these books, the brothers can be seen and heard <b>more</b> <b>clearly.</b> After collecting four pages, the brothers can talk clearly enough to tell the Stranger where the fifth and final missing page for their book is hidden; if the Stranger can complete either book, that brother will be set free. The clearer dialog also allows the player to more accurately judge each brother's personality. The Stranger is left with a choice to help Sirrus, Achenar, or neither.|$|E
5|$|Extant {{documentation}} {{makes it}} possible to follow the competition <b>more</b> <b>clearly</b> than {{in the case of the}} shrine dei Miracoli, and the delivered works, their dates and respective payments lend themselves to interesting analyses. By Tamagnino's arrival in 1499, Cairano already had delivered at least five different Caesars and other stone material, but only a payment for a single bust is documented, because his attention was completely taken up with two gigantic angular trophies that he had recently begun. In November 1499, Tamagnino delivered four Caesars and three leonine busts, which showcased his calibre and scale of production.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1838 of another fighter, William Phelps, {{also known as}} Brighton Bill, in a match against Owen Swift, the London Prize Ring Rules were {{introduced}} by the Pugilists's Protective Association to <b>more</b> <b>clearly</b> define the range of fouls and to introduce certain safety measures. Butting, gouging, biting, scratching, kicking were all forbidden as {{was the use of}} stones or any hard object in the hand. Thirty-second breaks were introduced between rounds, {{at the end of which}} each fighter had to walk to the scratch unaided within 8seconds. The wearing of spiked boots was prohibited, and boxers who went to ground without being hit were disqualified. These rules still form the basis for the modern sport of boxing.|$|E

5|$|In most countries, winter service {{vehicles}} usually have amber light bars, which are activated {{to indicate that}} the vehicle is operating below the local speed limit or otherwise poses a danger to other traffic, either by straddling lanes or by spreading grit or de-icer. In some areas, such as the Canadian province of Ontario, winter {{service vehicles}} use the blue flashing lights associated with emergency service vehicles, rather than the amber or orange used elsewhere. Many agencies also paint their vehicles in high-contrast orange or yellow to allow the vehicles to be seen <b>more</b> <b>clearly</b> in whiteout conditions.|$|E
5|$|The glyphs are stylized human, animal, {{vegetable}} and geometric shapes, and often form compounds. Nearly all those with heads are oriented {{head up and}} are either seen face on or in profile to the right, {{in the direction of}} writing. It is not known what significance turning a glyph head-down or to the left may have had. Heads often have characteristic projections on the sides which may be eyes (as on the sea turtle glyph below, and <b>more</b> <b>clearly</b> on sea-turtle petroglyphs) but which often resemble ears (as on the anthropomorphic petroglyph in the next section). Birds are common; many resemble the frigatebird (see image directly below) which was associated with the supreme god Makemake. Other glyphs look like fish or arthropods. A few are similar to petroglyphs found throughout the island.|$|E
5|$|The {{surfaces}} {{should be}} broad and simple, {{defined by a}} bold and clear design, accentuated in the important places. The enlargement of the details or their multiplicity is to be feared. By exaggerating the forms, in order to render them <b>more</b> <b>clearly</b> visible, or by enriching them with details, we would destroy {{the proportion of the}} work. Finally, the model, like the design, should have a summarized character, such as one would give to a rapid sketch. Only it is necessary that this character should be the product of volition and study, and that the artist, concentrating his knowledge, should find the form and the line in its greatest simplicity.|$|E
