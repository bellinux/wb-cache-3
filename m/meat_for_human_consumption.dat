25|$|In 1980 South Australia legalised {{the sale}} of {{kangaroo}} <b>meat</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b> Analysis showed {{that a variety of}} bushfoods were exceptionally nutritious. In the mid-1980s several Sydney restaurants began using native Australian ingredients in recipes more familiar to non-indigenous tastes – providing the first opportunity for bushfoods to be tried by non-indigenous Australians on a serious gourmet level. This led to the realisation that many strongly flavoured native food plants have spice-like qualities.|$|E
25|$|Domesticated pigs, called swine, {{are raised}} commercially for meat (generally called pork, hams, gammon or bacon), {{as well as}} for leather. Their bristly hairs are also used for brushes. Due to their common use as livestock, adult swine have gender {{specific}} names: the males are boars and the females are sows. In Britain, the word hog can refer to a castrated adult male pig. Young swine are called piglets or pigs. Pork {{is one of the most}} popular forms of <b>meat</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption,</b> accounting for 38% of worldwide meat production.|$|E
50|$|Selenium yeast supplementation of food-animal diets has {{an added}} {{nutritional}} benefit to human consumers of food-animal products. Dietary selenomethionine-containing plant or yeast protein can be also stored nonspecifically in animal protein, which {{can result in}} nutritionally useful selenium content in meat, milk, and eggs. Consequently, strategies to supplement animal feed with selenium yeast {{have led to the}} development of selenium-rich functional foods, including selenium-enriched eggs and <b>meats</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Another program {{executed}} by LDWF involves creating a market of nutria <b>meat</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption,</b> {{though it is}} still trying to gain public notice. Nutria is a very lean, protein-rich meat, low in fat and cholesterol with the taste, texture, and appearance of rabbit or dark turkey meat. [...] Few pathogens are associated with the meat, but proper heating when cooking should kill them. The quality of the meat and the minimal harmful microorganisms associated with it make nutria meat an [...] "excellent food product for export markets".|$|E
2500|$|Canada's biggest {{market for}} seal pelts is Norway. Carino Limited {{is one of}} Newfoundland's largest seal pelt producers. Carino (CAnada–RIeber–NOrway) is {{marketing}} its seal pelts mainly through its parent company, GC Rieber Skinn, Bergen, Norway. Canada sold pelts to eleven countries in 2004. The next largest were Germany, Greenland, and China/Hong Kong. Other importers were Finland, Denmark, France, Greece, South Korea, and Russia. Asia remains the principal market for seal meat exports. One of Canada's market access priorities for 2002 was to [...] "continue to press Korean authorities to obtain the necessary approvals {{for the sale of}} seal <b>meat</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption</b> in Korea." [...] Canadian and Korean officials agreed in 2003 on specific Korean import requirements for seal meat. For 2004, only Taiwan and South Korea purchased seal meat from Canada.|$|E
50|$|Likewise, {{the mystical}} reason for salting temple sacrifices and {{slaughtered}} meat {{is to remove}} the blood of animal-like passions from the person.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sequence-independent {{amplification}} {{of clinical}} specimens {{can lead to}} the identification of novel pathogens. OBJECTIVES: To identify novel viruses in human stool specimens from patients with diarrhea and to investigate the ecology and clinical significance of such viruses. STUDY DESIGN: Nucleic acid extracted from stool specimens from patients with diarrhea with no known etiology were subjected to random PCR amplification and Roche/ 454 pyrosequencing. Novel viruses identified were genetically and epidemiologically characterized. RESULTS: Four gyroviruses, chicken anemia virus (CAV), human gyrovirus (HGV) /avian gyrovirus 2 (AGV 2), gyrovirus 3 (GyV 3) and a novel gyrovirus (tentatively designated as gyrovirus 4 (GyV 4)) were identified in human stool specimens. GyV 4, as well as CAV and AGV 2 /HGV were also detected in chicken skin and <b>meat</b> used <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b> CONCLUSIONS: A novel gyrovirus (GyV 4) was identified in human stool and in chicken <b>meat</b> sold <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b> This virus was phylogenetically distinct from previously reported gyroviruses in chicken and humans (chicken anemia virus, human gyrovirus, avian gyrovirus 2 and recently reported gyrovirus 3). The epidemiology and pathogenesis of this virus in humans and in chicken needs to be further investigated. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|With {{the arrival}} of the Organic label, many people assumed that the terms “organic” and “natural” were interchangeable, failing to {{understand}} the strict regulations required to raise certified organic beef. The USDA defines “natural” beef as all <b>meats</b> raised <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption</b> without additives and minimally processed. Natural Beef producers may choose not to use antibiotics or growth-promoting hormones, but there is no third-party verification system required by the USDA. Beef from feedlots can be labeled natural, according to the USDA’s definition.|$|R
5000|$|The mites of the Cytoditidae and Laminosioptidae {{invade the}} {{respiratory}} system, and then other tissues, of their hosts. [...] Cytodites nudus infests poultry worldwide; although slight infestations cause little clinical harm, when infestation becomes heavy in individual birds, {{they can be}} severely weakened or die. Laminosioptes cysticola infests poultry where it accumulates in nodules {{that occur in the}} facia of subcutaneous muscle and also in the lungs. This causes little clinical harm to the birds, but devalues their <b>meat</b> intended <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b>|$|R
5|$|The creek whaler {{is a minor}} bycatch of inshore gillnet {{fisheries}} {{operating in}} northern Australia; the <b>meat</b> is sold <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b> Given its relatively high reproductive rate, its population appears capable of withstanding present levels of fishing.

50|$|Char-grilled steak (also {{charcoal}} steak) is {{a method}} of preparing <b>meat</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b> Although various animal steaks can technically be char-grilled, the process is generally used to cook chuck steaks. Char-grilled steaks are grilled with charcoal, and {{are not to be}} confused with gas-grilled steaks, which are usually grilled with propane. The charcoal used to prepare char-grilled steaks is usually attributed to the richness of flavor of steaks cooked in this manner.|$|E
30|$|There {{would not}} be any {{reindeer}} <b>meat</b> production <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption,</b> {{as in the previous}} scenarios, and economic values are created only through ecotourism. High management level makes high tourism numbers and new programmes possible. For example, ecotourism entrepreneurs sell predator-watching programmes. Park stewards control, manage and create habitats inside ONP and keep populations stable and control animal movements outside of the park. Park stewards can also make conservation hunting part of tourism business, by involving customers in arranged activities. Tourism infrastructures are hidden and routes lead to various wilderness spotting places.|$|R
30|$|The {{contamination}} of E. coli occurs in meat through soiling of the carcass and plant environment with faecal materials during slaughter process. This contamination is mainly evident where slaughter procedures are not hygienic as {{what happens at}} Chinsapo- 2 and Chigwirizano slaughter slabs. The results in the current agree with Jeffery et al. [15] in bovine carcasses in Sudan whereby E. coli represented the highest average prevalence. Sudan and Malawi are tropical countries, with ambient temperatures conducive {{for the growth of}} microorganisms resulting in rendering <b>meat</b> unsafe <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although no data {{illustrate}} the direct association of YTXs and toxicity in humans, issues {{with regards to}} the potential health risks of YTXs still stand due to the significant animal toxicity observed, and like other algal toxins present within shellfish, YTKs are not destroyed by heating or freezing. As a result, several countries, including New Zealand, Japan, and those in Europe, regulate the levels of YTXs in shellfish. In 2002, the European Commission placed the regulatory level at 1 µg of YTXs per g (1 mg/kg) of shellfish <b>meat</b> intended <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption</b> (Directive 20012/225/EC).|$|R
