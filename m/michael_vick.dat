5|$|The Hokies' offense starred redshirt {{freshman}} quarterback <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick,</b> who finished {{the season as}} the third-place runner-up for the Heisman Trophy. Vick's Hokies, who had been favored in every game that year, entered the game as 5.5-point underdogs.|$|E
5|$|Vick {{has been}} a {{principal}} in two charitable foundations, the <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick</b> Foundation and The Vick Foundation. In June 2006, Vick, along with his brother Marcus and mother Brenda, established The Vick Foundation, a nonprofit organization to support at-risk youth with after-school programs in the Metro Atlanta and Hampton Roads areas. The announcement of the new organization came just {{before the start of}} the foundation's first fundraiser, the <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick</b> Golf Classic. The inaugural event was held at the prestigious Kingsmill Golf Course in James City County near Williamsburg, Virginia in partnership with The Virginia Tech Alumni Association Tidewater Chapter, and raised more than $80,000 for charity. According to its 2006 federal tax return, the <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick</b> Foundation provided 100 backpacks to poor children in Newport News and paid for an after-school program. The foundation spent 12% of its 2006 budget – $20,590 of $171,823 – on charitable programs and paid its fundraiser, Susan Bass Roberts, a former spokeswoman for Vick, $97,000. The foundation ceased operations that year. One of Vick's financial advisors withdrew $50,000 – most of the remaining funds – from its checking account in 2008.|$|E
5|$|During {{the regular}} season, Virginia Tech's offense outscored opponents {{by an average}} of 31points per game. Tech {{averaged}} 254yards rushing per game, the eighth-highest average in the nation. Important to that success was running back Shyrone Stith, who had 1,119rushing yards during the regular season. Even more important to the Hokies' success, however, was quarterback <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick.</b>|$|E

5|$|In addition, {{the game}} was a rematch of the 2000 BCS National Championship Game. In that game, held in New Orleans, Louisiana, Florida State {{defeated}} Virginia Tech 4629 despite the performance of Hokie quarterback <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick,</b> who would later be selected as the first overall pick in the 2001 NFL Draft. Vick's brother, Marcus, would be the Hokies' starter at quarterback for the 2005 ACC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|Despite Warrick's {{individual}} performance, Virginia Tech {{was more}} successful in a team effort, compiling 503total yards compared to Florida State's 359yards. Virginia Tech quarterback <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick</b> completed 15 of 29passes for 225passing yards and one passing touchdown. Vick also ran the ball 23times for 97yards in his performance as the game's leading rusher. Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke was the game's best passer, completing 20 of his 34pass attempts for 329yards, four touchdowns, and one interception.|$|E
5|$|Dozens of National Football League {{draft picks}} have played for Virginia Tech in bowl games, {{including}} two first-overall selections: Bruce Smith and <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick.</b> Smith {{participated in the}} 1984 Independence Bowl, while Vick quarterbacked the Hokies to their first national championship appearance during the 2000 Sugar Bowl, and followed that performance by leading the Hokies to the 2001 Gator Bowl, his final collegiate game. Following the game, Vick entered the 2001 NFL Draft and was selected by the Atlanta Falcons.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{successful}} rookie season, Urlacher {{was able to}} gain popularity with the fans. On a national level, Urlacher's jersey sales have rivaled those of other NFL superstars, such as Brett Favre and <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick.</b> Football fans across the nation have also voted Urlacher into eight Pro Bowls. Urlacher's teammates and coaches have also praised his character and athletic ability. In 2007, former teammate Tank Johnson called upon Urlacher to testify {{during one of his}} court hearings.|$|E
5|$|For his {{performance}} in the game, Florida Statewide receiver Peter Warrick was named the game's most valuable player. Although Tech lost the game, several of its players won postseason awards—most notably <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick,</b> who earned an ESPY for {{his performance}} during the Sugar Bowl and the regular season. Several players from each team entered the National Football League after graduation, being selected either in the 2000 NFL Draft or later editions of that selection process.|$|E
5|$|In that half, Tech pulled {{steadily}} {{away from}} the Tigers. Virginia Tech scored 13points {{in the third quarter}} and seven in the fourth quarter, and Clemson never seriously challenged the Hokies, who went on to record a 41–20 victory. The game was the final collegiate contest for Tech quarterback <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick,</b> who would go on to be selected as the first overall pick in the 2001 NFL Draft.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the regular}} season, a {{constant}} question {{hanging over the}} Virginia Tech Hokies football team was whether or not star quarterback <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick</b> would return for another year at the school. The National Football League requires that players be {{at least three years}} out of high school before they are eligible for the NFL Draft. Vick, who had not played during his freshman year at the school, would be three years out of high school in the spring following the Gator Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Clemson fielded {{the opening}} kickoff at the two-yard line and {{returned}} it to their 25-yard line, where the Tigers' offense performed the game's first offensive play, a one-yard scramble by Dantzler. A subsequent running play and an incomplete pass caused Clemson to go three-and-out before punting. Clemson punter Jamie Somaini mishandled the ball, however, and Virginia Tech's defense tackled him at the Tigers' 23-yard line. On Tech's first play after the turnover, quarterback <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick</b> completed a 23-yard pass to Jared Ferguson for a touchdown. The extra point kick by Carter Warley was successful, and Virginia Tech had a 70 lead with 13:23 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{entered the}} 2000 college {{football}} season with hopes of following up its {{victory in the}} 2000 Sugar Bowl with another national championship. The Seminoles' regular-season performance differed slightly from 1999, as they lost a regular-season game to Miami, yet still appeared in a third consecutive national championship game: the 2001 Orange Bowl. Unlike in 2000, the Seminoles emerged on the losing side of a 132 score. Virginia Tech, like Florida State, had hoped to attend the national championship game again, but an injury to star quarterback <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick</b> caused the Hokies to lose a regular-season game at third-ranked Miami, eliminating them from national championship contention.|$|E
50|$|Celek {{ended the}} season with 811 {{receiving}} yards, as quarterback <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick's</b> favorite target. He {{was one of three}} Eagle offensive players to start all 16 games, along with right tackle Todd Herremans and rookie center Jason Kelce. During the offseason, Celek was involved in a DUI car accident. He was the passenger of the car. No one was hurt.|$|R
50|$|On January 23, 2005, the Eagles {{reached a}} fourth {{consecutive}} conference championship game (the {{first time this}} happened in the salary cap era of the NFL). At long last, the Eagles justified the hopes of their long-suffering fan base, defeating <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick's</b> much-hyped Atlanta Falcons, 27-10, sending them to their first Super Bowl in 24 years. The victory sent the city of Philadelphia into wild celebrations.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{season after}} <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick's</b> dramatic comeback for the Hokies, Virginia Tech again {{came back to}} beat West Virginia. After leading 14-7 in the third quarter, the Mountaineers collapsed. André Davis, Tech's speedy receiver, scored on a 30-yard reverse, a 64-yard pass and a 76-yard punt return {{in the span of}} six minutes to lead the Hokies to a 48-20 victory. 41 of Tech's 48 points came in the second half, which was a school record.|$|R
5|$|In {{recognition}} of his success in leading the Hokies to a bowl game win, Virginia Tech quarterback <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick</b> was named {{the most valuable player}} of the winning team. Vick finished the game having completed 10 of 18 passes for 205 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. Vick also ran the ball nine times for a gain of 21 yards and a touchdown. He was sacked twice, resulting in a loss of two yards. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, Clemson wide receiver Rod Gardner was named the MVP of the losing team. He caught seven passes for 94 yards and a touchdown during the game.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} draft, the Falcons had two picks {{in the first}} round. These {{selections}} were Tommy Nobis, a linebacker from Texas, and Randy Johnson, a quarterback from Texas A. The Falcons have selected number one overall four times: Tommy Nobis, Steve Bartkowski, Aundray Bruce, and <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick.</b> The team has also selected number two overall three times and number three overall two times. The Falcons have selected players from Florida State University four times, the most from any university. The team's most recent first-round selection was Keanu Neal, a strong safety from the University of Florida.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} game of the season, the Hokies lived up to expectations, {{shutting}} out James Madison University, 470. The game was the first time Tech had shut out an opponent in a season opener since 1953. The game was marred, however, by a leg injury to <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick</b> that caused him to leave the game. The following week, against the University of Alabama Birmingham, Vick did not play. Despite his absence, the Hokies still managed a 3110 win. This was followed by a 3111 Thursday-night victory over Clemson in Virginia Tech's first game against a Division I-A opponent during the season.|$|E
50|$|Off the field, {{the curse}} has {{found its way}} towards athletes as well. Eugene Robinson, who played for the Falcons during the 1998 season, was arrested for soliciting a prostitute the night before Super Bowl XXXIII. <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick's</b> arrest for an illegal dog {{fighting}} ring came {{while he was still}} with the Falcons. Thabo Sefolosha, the Hawks' star defender in 2015, was arrested in New York City weeks before the beginning of the NBA playoffs and suffered a fractured tibia while being detained.|$|R

Best Friends also took {{in some of}} former NFL quarterback <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick's</b> fighting dogs. In December 2008, Georgia, one of the former Vick dogs, appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show with Best Friends' dog trainer John Garcia. The two also appeared on CNN's [...] "Larry King Live" [...] show.|$|R
5|$|Some {{players who}} participated in the 2000 Sugar Bowl elected to delay their entry into the NFL Draft, either because they hoped to finish their {{education}} or because they were not three years removed from their high school graduations and thus were not eligible to enter the draft. Examples of these players included Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke, who returned to Florida State to complete his senior year, and Virginia Tech quarterback <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick,</b> who was not eligible to enter the draft in 2000, but who was taken with the first overall selection in the 2001 NFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|The {{first player}} {{selected}} in the draft was quarterback <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick</b> from Virginia Tech, who was selected by the Atlanta Falcons after they acquired the first pick in a trade with the San Diego Chargers. Vick spent six seasons with the Falcons before being sentenced to 21 months in prison for his involvement in an illegal interstate dog fighting ring, eventually rebounding {{his career with the}} Philadelphia Eagles after being released from prison and winning the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year Award in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{entered the}} game headed by star quarterback <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick,</b> {{who led the}} Hokies to a 101 regular-season record despite being injured for {{a part of the}} season. Clemson entered the game with a regular-season record of 92 under the command of head coach Tommy Bowden, who was in the second year of his tenure. The contest {{featured}} two high-scoring offenses that emphasized different aspects of the game. These aspects were exemplified in the game, which saw Clemson pass for more yards than Virginia Tech, while the Hokies ran for more yards than the Tigers.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, Our Pack's {{work with}} former fight dogs was {{mentioned}} nationwide when founder McClay rescued a dog named Leo who was seized in the raid on NFL star <b>Michael</b> <b>Vick's</b> Bad Newz Kennels. McClay fostered Leo {{in her home}} and despite his rough start, under Our Pack's care Leo received his therapy registration in just five weeks. The story was covered by among others The Washington Post, NBC news, and the Best Friends Animal Society. McClay adopted Leo and he continued therapy work with cancer survivors {{until his death in}} late 2011.|$|R
50|$|<b>Michael</b> <b>Vick's</b> 2000 season {{did have}} {{its share of}} highlights, such as his career rushing high of 210 yards against the Boston College Eagles in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. Against West Virginia in the Black Diamond Trophy game, Vick {{accounted}} for 288 total yards of offense and two touchdowns in a 48-20 win. The following week, Vick led the Hokies back from a 14-0 deficit against Syracuse at the Carrier Dome—where the Hokies had not won since 1986. Vick put the game away with a 55-yard run with 1:34 left.|$|R
50|$|The 2008 Atlanta Falcons {{season was}} the 43rd {{season for the}} team in the National Football League (NFL). Overcoming a disappointing 4-12 record, quarterback <b>Michael</b> <b>Vicks</b> dog {{fighting}} scandal and head coach Bobby Petrinos abrupt resignation in 2007, the Falcons, who {{were expected to be}} in a rebuilding phase, completed the regular season with a surprising 11-5 record and earned the #5 seed in the NFC Playoffs under first-year head coach Mike Smith; however, the team would fall to the eventual NFC champion Arizona Cardinals in the wild-card round of the playoffs.|$|R
