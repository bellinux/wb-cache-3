40|$|Freight {{transportation}} at distribution nodes such as <b>marine</b> ports, <b>airports</b> {{and rail}} yards has been putting tremendous environmental pressure in metropolitan areas. A prerequisite for proposing any solution {{that would make}} the existing systems more efficient is an accurate analysis and understanding of freight movements. A single model cannot fully capture aspects of freight transportation which interact and affect each other in a complex manner. Rather, integration of a variety of legacy simulation and analysis tools along with holistic optimization is a necessity for freight transportation system design. This paper proposes an integrated modeling and simulation framework for freight transportation using semantic web technology which offers benefits of modularity, extensibility and reusability of both code and design to the applications. We discuss the implementation strategies and methods to achieve these goals and identify some of the key research challenges in realizing our framework vision. 1...|$|R

Special homes, authorized by state officials and operated by Cuban refugees, were formed in several hundred cities across the nation including Albuquerque, New Mexico; Lincoln, Nebraska; Wilmington, Delaware; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Jacksonville and Orlando, Florida. Laws prevented any relocated children from being housed in reform schools or centers for juvenile delinquents. A large majority of the minors who arrived in Miami were {{between the ages of}} 12 and 18, and more than two-thirds were boys over the age of 12.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. An examination {{is made of}} the nature of propagation of sea breeze fronts in central California. From 15 to 30 September, 1987, the LandSea Breeze Experiment (LASBEX) provided a series of meteorological observations including sodar, lidar, rawinsonde, radiosonde and surface observations. Surface observations of opportunity were also available from local <b>marine</b> labs and <b>airports.</b> Using a very simple linear model, the speed and direction of the sea breeze front is investigated. The speed of frontal propagation varied from 1 ms to 3 ms. A correlation between the speed of frontal propagation and estimated surface heat flux is observed. The direction of frontal propagation tends to be up valley. Comparison of the frontal propagation vector with stations in the southern portion of Monterey Bay shows that the front is curved on the mesoscale. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
50|$|The {{large-scale}} {{evacuation of}} Vietnamese by American military transport aircraft began on April 23 from Tan Son Nhut airport in Saigon. North Vietnamese rockets were fired at Tan Son Nhut on April 29, killing two American <b>marines,</b> and the <b>airport</b> was closed later that day. Thousands of Vietnamese and Americans were still clustered inside the American Embassy {{and in the}} streets around the Embassy awaiting evacuation. All that afternoon and night, military helicopters landed {{on the roof of}} the Embassy and carried evacuees to U.S. navy ships waiting off shore. Tens of thousands of Vietnamese evacuated themselves, primarily by taking boats out to sea and demanding to be picked up by the navy. Early on the morning of April 30, the last Americans, 11 marines, were evacuated by helicopter from the Embassy roof. Many Vietnamese and third country nationals awaiting or hoping for evacuation were left behind.|$|R

40|$|Cruise POS 500 “LISA” with R/V Poseidon {{studied the}} western Ligurian Margin off Southern France, {{an area in}} the northeastern part of the western Mediterranean Sea {{characterized}} by its active tectonism and frequent mass wasting. The region near the Var estuary close {{to the city of}} Nice is particularly suited for landslide research because it represents a natural laboratority where it is possible to study a series of trigger processes of geological and anthropogenic origin. The aim of this MARUM expedition was to: i. Study fresh water seepage in the <b>marine</b> Nice <b>airport</b> landslide and adjacent stable plateau in 15 - 50 m water depth using water sampling, CTD and geochemistry; ii. Recover and deploy a number of observatories that monitor, pressure, temperature, tilt and seismicity; iii. Run an AUV micro-bathymetric survey with MARUM AUV SEAL 5000 to complement existing multibeam maps; and iv. Acquire additional high-resolution seismic reflection profiles to unravel the complex architecture of the Nice slope and Var delta. In a period of approximately two weeks, we acquired valuable geophysical information that helps to understand the evolution of this portion of the Ligurian Margin and further to support an active Amphibious Drilling proposal submitted to ICDP and IODP. We could also show that heavy spring rainfall plus melt water from the French Maritime Alps supplied sufficient hydraulic forcing to push Var aquifer groundwaters to seep into the marine deposits and water column. Freshening was strongest in the 1979 Nice landslide scar, but was also found at {{the outer edge of the}} shelf. Recovery and redeployment of various observatory prototypes worked well, both for the MARUM MeBo seafloor drillstring tolos and independent piezometers. Observatory data have yet to be evaluated. In addition, geochemical analyses of bottom waters and pore waters was deferred to shore-based laboratorios except for salinity estimates using a refractometer. Seismic processing was started onboard, but is largely taking place post-cruise at University Bremen...|$|R
5000|$|The 1990s {{began with}} {{elements}} of the Division participating in Operation Sharp Edge, the evacuation of American and allied civilians out of war torn Liberia. This was followed by deployments to Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Desert Shield and then the liberation of Kuwait in Operation Desert Storm. The 2nd Marine Division {{played a major role}} repelling the attempted Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia which is known as the Battle of Khafji. The 2nd Marine Division faced heavy resistance during the Battle of Kuwait International <b>Airport.</b> <b>Marine</b> Reserve unit Bravo Company, 4th Tank Battalion, 4th Marine division was assigned to the 2nd Marine Division. On February 25, 1991, Day 2 of the Desert Storm ground war, Bravo Company 4th Tank Battalion was in a coil formation and awakened from a 25% watch to find 35 Iraqi Republican Guard tanks angling across their front, not realizing at the time that they were outnumbered 3-1. With their 13 M1A1 Abrams tanks, Bravo Company 4th Tank Battalion moved online to take out the 35 Iraqi Republican Guard tanks in less than 90 seconds. This battle was named the [...] "Reveille Engagement" [...] and went on to be the biggest and fastest tank battle in United States Marine Corps history. Bravo company went on to destroy 59 tanks, 32 APCs, 26 non armored vehicles, and an artillery gun. Bravo Company destroyed a total of 119 enemy vehicles and took over 800 POWs. Tank crew [...] "Stepchild" [...] has the longest confirmed live kill (Iraqi BMP) by a tank at 3,750 meters (2.33miles). On {{the second day of the}} U.S. advance a platoon from the Marine 8th Battalion destroyed 13 Iraqi tanks in a battle near a defensive position known as the Ice Tray. Marine and Navy air power then inflicted heavy casualties on retreating Iraqi forces leading north out of Kuwait City. [...] The 1st Tank Battalion claimed 50 Iraqi T-55 and T-62 tanks and 25 APCs. The 3rd Battalion claimed 57 T-55s and T-62s(plus 5 T-72s), 7 APCs, and 10 trucks. The 8th Battalion destroyed more than three dozen tanks and a number of other vehicles. On the third and final day of combat the 2nd Marine Division would liberate the city of Al Jahra then would go on to occupy the high ground on the Mutla Ridge cutting off the Iraqi escape route from Kuwait to Basra.
