Sisto said of working on the show, [...] "For nine months we basically do the same episode over and over. This [...] came out of nowhere." [...] Sisto said of working on Into Temptation: [...] "Having just come off a job where there is little room to find true moments and to create a full character, I felt this respite from the task of trying to force a space where I could express something more personal through <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> no less than a creative life saver." ...|$|E

"Except for the {{few months}} at sea in Assiniboine, my war work was a solid slog, mostly at a desk, {{averaging}} 15 hours a day with frequently a full 24. <b>My</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> to obtain the greatest possible result from relatively inexperienced personnel. There was little opportunity for anyone to step on another’s toes. They were spread too thinly {{and there was a}} more responsible job for each as soon as he felt confident of his ability to take it on. In the autumn of 1941 young volunteer reserve officers who had never seen salt water before the war took command of corvettes manned by 88 men—the number of white and black keys on a piano and each with his own peculiar note—and took their full part in the Battle of the Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|The film {{is based}} on a 19th-century Russian folktale, which Joe Ranft {{introduced}} to Burton while they were finishing The Nightmare Before Christmas. The film began production in November 2003, while Burton was completing Big Fish. He continued with production on his next live-action feature, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which was produced simultaneously with the film. Co-director Mike Johnson spoke about how they took a more organic approach to directing the film, saying: [...] "In a co-directing situation, one director usually handles one sequence while the other handles another. Our approach was more organic. Tim knew where he wanted the film to go as far as the emotional tone and story points to hit. <b>My</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> to work with the crew on a daily basis and get the footage {{as close as possible to}} how I thought he wanted it." ...|$|E

500|$|Series head {{writer of}} the first season Merriwether Williams said the episode's story is [...] "so simple." [...] She remarked [...] "To me, it's {{one of the best}} episodes. It just stayed with one idea." [...] The episode was about [...] "how he [...] keeps missing the bus and how that makes him feel." [...] Williams said the episode was [...] "so small that you could explore gags and {{opportunities}} for gags." [...] The episode was an example of [...] "a good outline" [...] in the series where the storyboards and humor were done easily. Williams said [...] "it was great for the board guys." [...] She added [...] "In many ways, <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> to create situations where the board guys could be funny, to create a situation that could be funny, and let them go for the actual, specific jokes." ...|$|E
500|$|At 766 {{pages in}} the British edition and 870 in the American edition, Order of the Phoenix is the longest book in the Harry Potter series. Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg {{described}} his task to cut down the novel as searching for [...] "the best equivalent way to tell the story. <b>My</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> to stay true {{to the spirit of}} the book, rather than to the letter". Goldenberg said that Rowling told him, the producers, and Yates that [...] "she just wanted to see a great movie, and gave [...] permission to take whatever liberties [...] felt [...] needed to take to translate the book into a movie she would love". Cutting down the book to meet the time frame of the film, Goldenberg explained, became [...] "clearer when [...] figured out that the organising principle of the screenplay was to narrate Harry's emotional journey". He and Yates [...] "looked for every opportunity to get everything [...] could in there. And where [...] couldn't, to sort of pay homage to it, to have it somewhere in the background or to feel like it could be taking place off-screen".|$|E
500|$|After being heavily {{recruited}} by several colleges around the country, Solo attended the University of Washington from 1999 to 2002 where she majored in speech communications. With the Huskies, she switched permanently to goalkeeper under {{the lead of}} head coach Lesle Gallimore and goalkeeper coach and former national team player, Amy Griffin. Solo described the transition in her memoir, [...] "In high school, I had been the forward who won games. It was a huge mental adjustment to learn that <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> to save games. To anticipate what was needed. Before, I would stand in goal, the ball would come toward me, and I'd use my athletic ability to make the save. But thanks to Amy's tutelage and my time with the national team, I was becoming a much better tactical goalkeeper. I learned how to read my opponents' runs toward goal, how to position my defenders, how to see the angles... The intellectual side also made goalkeeping so much more interesting. It wasn't just ninety minutes of waiting for my defense to make a mistake. It was ninety minutes of tactics and strategy. The personality traits that had been shaped by my childhood—resilience and toughness—were assets at the position." ...|$|E

500|$|Bain Capital's {{leveraged}} buyouts sometimes led to layoffs, either {{soon after}} acquisition or later after {{the firm had}} concluded its role. Exactly how many jobs Bain Capital added compared to those lost because of these investments and buyouts is unknown, owing {{to a lack of}} records and Bain Capital's penchant for privacy on behalf of itself and its investors. Maximizing the value of acquired companies and the return to Bain's investors, not job creation, was the firm's primary investment goal. Bain Capital's acquisition of Ampad exemplified a deal where it profited handsomely from early payments and management fees, even though the subject company itself later went into bankruptcy. Dade Behring was another case where Bain Capital received an eightfold return on its investment, but the company itself was saddled with debt and laid off over a thousand employees before Bain Capital exited (the company subsequently went into bankruptcy, with more layoffs, before recovering and prospering). Referring to the layoffs that sometimes occurred, Romney said in 2007: [...] "Sometimes the medicine is a little bitter but it is necessary {{to save the life of}} the patient. <b>My</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> to try and make the enterprise successful, and in my view the best security a family can have is that the business they work for is strong." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Tea Leaves" [...] {{was written}} by Matthew Weiner and Erin Levy and {{directed}} by series star Jon Hamm. This is the first episode of the series that Jon Hamm had directed, with Hamm saying that he owes thanks to John Slattery for paving the way. As preparation for directing the Rolling Stones concert, Hamm looked over archival photographs of the original concert. [...] "They were kids. The Rolling Stones. It was them and The Beatles. These huge pop explosions. People were really excited about {{it and it was}} a really big deal. And, in a larger sense, gave us a sense of where advertising is going." [...] Reflecting on his directing job, Hamm noted that he tried not to put much distracting style into the show, explaining that [...] "My job was not {{to go in there and}} muck it up and say, [...] "I'm gonna put my stamp on this." [...] <b>My</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> to go in there and keep the train on the tracks, basically. We have a very firmly established tone and look to our show that people respond to, and that I love."

500|$|The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer {{office was}} located in the same building, and Bakshi spoke to then-president Dan Melnick. [...] "I thought he would {{understand}} what The Rings meant, because UA did not." [...] Bakshi and Melnick {{made a deal with}} Mike Medavoy at United Artists to buy the Boorman script. [...] "The Boorman script cost $3 million, so Boorman was happy by the pool, screaming and laughing and drinking, 'cause he got $3 million for his script to be thrown out." [...] However, after Melnick was fired from MGM, the deal fell through. Bakshi then contacted Saul Zaentz (who had helped finance Fritz the Cat) to ask him to produce The Lord of the Rings, and Zaentz agreed. Before the production started, the original three-part adaptation was negotiated down to two parts at United Artists, and Bakshi met with Tolkien's daughter Priscilla to discuss how the film would be made. She showed him the room where her father did his writing and drawing. Bakshi says, [...] "My promise to Tolkien's daughter was to be pure to the book. I wasn't going to say, 'Hey, throw out Gollum and change these two characters.' <b>My</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> to say, 'This is what the genius said.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Though {{the fight}} was {{initially}} kept under wraps, both Russell and Clooney eventually gave official statements saying that the argument had blown over and neither harbored any ill will towards the other. However, Clooney continued to describe the event in later interviews, {{as well as the}} cover story of the October 2003 issue of Vanity Fair, in which he states: [...] "I would not stand for him humiliating and yelling and screaming at crew members, who weren't allowed to defend themselves. I don't believe in it and it makes me crazy. So <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> then to humiliate the people who were doing the humiliating." [...] Executive producer and production manager Gregory Goodman later stated about Clooney's comments in the media, [...] "It doesn't reflect well on [...] It's like some stupid sandbox quarrel." [...] In early 2012, Clooney indicated that he and Russell had mended their relationship, saying [...] "We made a really, really great film, and we had a really rough time together, but it's a case of both of us getting older. I really do appreciate the work he continues to do, and I think he appreciates what I'm trying to do." ...|$|E
