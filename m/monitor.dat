40|$|Service <b>monitoring</b> is an {{important}} part in web service systems, since it aims to ensure that the functions and performance of the service have fulfill the customers' requirements, and detect the potential risks as early as possible. However, <b>monitoring</b> has its costs, which will cause the performance degradation of <b>monitored</b> service system and large resources consumption. If <b>monitoring</b> costs are higher than <b>monitoring</b> benefits, service <b>monitoring</b> will be meaningless. Therefore, it is necessary to balance the <b>monitoring</b> benefits and <b>monitoring</b> costs. Efficient service <b>monitoring</b> means cost-efficiently and time-efficiently of service <b>monitoring.</b> In order to maximize the functions of service <b>monitoring,</b> careful study on how to improve the efficiency of service <b>monitoring</b> is required. This thesis mainly presents a taxonomy of different approaches of service <b>monitoring.</b> It covers several existing optimization approaches, and describes them by giving examples.

5|$|Varanus salvadorii is {{a species}} of <b>monitor</b> lizard, which is endemic to New Guinea. It is also known by the common names {{crocodile}} <b>monitor,</b> Papua(n) <b>monitor,</b> Salvadori's <b>monitor</b> and artellia. The largest <b>monitor</b> lizard in New Guinea, it {{is believed to be}} one of the longest lizards in the world, verified at up to , and in rare cases it may rival or exceed the length of the world's largest lizard, the Komodo dragon. It is the sole member of the subgenus Papusaurus. V.salvadorii is an arboreal lizard with a dark green body and yellowish bands, a blunt snout and a very long tail. It lives in mangrove swamps and coastal rainforests in the southeastern part of the island, where it feeds on birds, small mammals, eggs, and carrion in the wild, using teeth better adapted than those of most monitors for seizing fast-moving prey. Like all monitors, it has anatomical features that enable it to breathe more easily when running than other lizards can, and V. salvadorii may have greater stamina than most monitors. Little is known of its reproduction and development, as the species is very difficult to breed in captivity.|$|E

40|$|State <b>monitoring</b> is a {{fundamental}} building block for Cloud services. The demand for providing state <b>monitoring</b> as services (MaaS) continues to grow and is evidenced by CloudWatch from Amazon EC 2, which allows cloud consumers to pay for <b>monitoring</b> a selection of performance metrics with coarse-grained periodical sampling of runtime states. One of the key challenges for wide deployment of MaaS is to provide better balance among a set of critical quality and performance parameters, such as accuracy, cost, scalability and customizability. This dissertation research is dedicated to innovative {{research and development of}} an elastic framework for providing state <b>monitoring</b> as a service (MaaS). We analyze limitations of existing techniques, systematically identify the need and the challenges at different layers of a Cloud <b>monitoring</b> service platform, and develop a suite of distributed <b>monitoring</b> techniques to support for flexible <b>monitoring</b> infrastructure, cost-effective state <b>monitoring</b> and monitoring-enhanced Cloud management. At the <b>monitoring</b> infrastructure layer, we develop techniques to support multi-tenancy of <b>monitoring</b> services by exploring cost sharing between <b>monitoring</b> tasks and safeguarding <b>monitoring</b> resource usage. To provide elasticity in <b>monitoring,</b> we propose techniques to allow the <b>monitoring</b> infrastructure to self-scale with <b>monitoring</b> demand. At the cost-effective state <b>monitoring</b> layer, we devise several new state <b>monitoring</b> functionalities to meet unique functional requirements in Cloud <b>monitoring.</b> Violation likelihood state <b>monitoring</b> explores the benefits of consolidating <b>monitoring</b> workloads by allowing utility-driven <b>monitoring</b> intensity tuning on individual <b>monitoring</b> tasks and identifying correlations between <b>monitoring</b> tasks. Window based state <b>monitoring</b> leverages distributed windows for the best <b>monitoring</b> accuracy and communication efficiency. Reliable state <b>monitoring</b> is robust to both transient and long-lasting communication issues caused by component failures or cross-VM performance interferences. At the monitoring-enhanced Cloud management layer, we devise a novel technique to learn about the performance characteristics of both Cloud infrastructure and Cloud applications from cumulative performance <b>monitoring</b> data to increase the cloud deployment efficiency.

It is often desirable to perform global <b>monitoring</b> to guarantee end-to-end QoS {{for services}} across domains {{and to reduce}} the <b>monitoring</b> cost. However, global <b>monitoring</b> might be infeasible due to confidentiality constraints. The alternative solution is to perform per-domain <b>monitoring.</b> In this work, we propose to evaluate global and per-domain <b>monitoring</b> techniques. For this end, we study the properties of multi-domain networks and the requirements of multi-domain <b>monitoring.</b> We formulate the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). We show {{that it is a}} Nondeterministic Polynomial Time Hard (NP-Hard) problem, and therefore, we devise a heuristic that meets multi-domain properties. We show that confidentiality is far from being the only constraint to global multi-domain <b>monitoring.</b> In our evaluation, the confidentiality constraint has been relaxed, in order to investigate other performance metrics; namely, the <b>monitoring</b> cost, the quality of <b>monitored</b> paths, the anomaly detection delays, and the fairness of <b>monitoring</b> load distribution among domains. Simulation results on random topologies show that per-domain <b>monitoring</b> outperforms global <b>monitoring</b> for all these metrics, except the <b>monitoring</b> cost that is slightly lower for global <b>monitoring...</b>|$|R
