So, for example, if fair market rent for that unit would be $1,000, the seller might charge $1,100 with $200 of that being credited toward the purchase price.|$|R

30|$|Since 2005, {{a number}} of conservancies {{have been set up}} on the {{communal}} and privatised group ranches adjacent to the MMNR. Conservancies differ in their institutional arrangements; however, the common model found in the Mara occurs on privatised land and illustrates ‘group conservancies’, where groups of landowners have partnered with tourism operators to form a conservancy. The conservancy is primarily set aside for wildlife and tourism but with some controlled livestock grazing allowed. The partnerships involve individual lease agreements between the tourism operators and landowners, the most widespread of which involves landowners receiving fixed <b>monthly</b> land <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> from the tourism operators, independent of the number of tourists visiting the conservancy (Bedelian 2014). The tourism operators also manage the conservancy and put up high-end tourism camps. Payments are made monthly straight to the bank accounts of individual landowners. In return, landowners must agree to vacate their land, remove settlements and livestock and refrain from any other land use within the conservancy. From an initial two conservancies in 2006, the conservancy model was quickly replicated {{in other areas of the}} Mara and by 2012 had increased to eight conservancies adjacent to the MMNR (Figure  1). In December 2015, there were 17 conservancies reported in the wider Narok County (Reid, RS, D Kaelo, KA Galvin, and R Harmon: Pastoral wildlife conservancies in Kenya: A bottom-up revolution in conservation, balancing livelihoods and conservation?, unpublished).|$|R
50|$|Financing and leasing {{services}} {{provide a}} means for individuals or companies to acquire goods without any initial capital outlay. Financing is the act of acquiring capital for a purchase or some other activity. Financing services are offered by lenders (a bank or other institution) that provide capital to other individuals or companies {{in the form of}} a loan, which is then paid back within a predetermined time period for a set fee or interest rate. Leasing is the act of entering into a contractual arrangement (i.e. a lease) to obtain temporary possession of an asset (land, equipment, etc.) in exchange for a fixed compensation (for example, a <b>monthly</b> <b>payment).</b> <b>Leasing</b> services are provided by organizations that either manage the <b>lease</b> and <b>payment</b> transactions, furnish the assets or land that is being leased, or both. Financing and leasing services within the context of data center services might include leasing a data center facility; leasing data center equipment, such as servers; or financing a data center project, such as building or upgrading a data center facility.|$|R
5000|$|The {{present value}} of the minimum <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> (MLP) is {{equal to or greater}} than 90% of the fair market value of leased property. To {{understand}} and apply this criterion, you need familiarize yourself with what is included in the minimum <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> and how the present value is calculated. The minimum <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> include the minimum rental payments minus any executory cost, the guaranteed residual value, the bargain purchase option, and any penalty for failure to renew or extend the lease. The amount calculated is then discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. However, if the lessee knows the implicit rate used by the lessor and the rate is less than the lessee’s rate, the lessee should use the lessor’s rate to discount the minimum <b>lease</b> <b>payment.</b>|$|R

40|$|Subsidiary S (seller-lessee), a {{subsidiary}} of Company A, enters into a sale-leaseback transaction for a building with Company B (buyer-lessor). Company B requires Company A to provide an unsecured guarantee of the <b>lease</b> <b>payments.</b> The transaction otherwise meets all of the provisions under Statement 98 for Subsidiary S to use sale-leaseback accounting. The issue is whether Company A's unsecured guarantee of Subsidiary S's <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> {{is a form of}} continuing involvement that precludes the application of sale-leaseback accounting under Statement 98 in (1) Subsidiary S's separate financial statements and (2) Company A's consolidated financial statements. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force expressed the view that an entity's unsecured guarantee of its own <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> is not a form of continuing involvement that precludes sale-leaseback accounting under Statement 98 because such a guarantee does not provide the buyer-lessor with additional collateral that reduces the buyer-lessor's risk of loss, except in the event of the seller-lessee's bankruptcy. The Task Force reached a consensus that an unsecured guarantee of the <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> of one member Copyright © 1991, Financial Accounting Standards Boar...|$|R

40|$|An entity leases {{an asset}} under an {{operating}} lease {{for use in}} its operations. Prior to the expiration of the original lease term, the lessee and lessor agree to modify the lease by shortening the lease term and increasing the <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> over the shortened lease period. The modifications do not change the lease classification and no other changes are made to the lease. The issue is how the adjustment to the lease term {{and the increase in}} the <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> over the shortened lease period should be accounted for. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that the treatment of the increase in the <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> over the shortened lease period is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. If the increase is, in substance, only a modification of future <b>lease</b> <b>payments,</b> the increase should be accounted for prospectively over the term of the modified lease.
