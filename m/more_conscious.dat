5|$|When the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces {{arrived in}} Japan—all with boots {{polished}} {{to a degree}} not known in the U.S. forces—the G.I.s were <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> than ever of their feet. The secret was found to rest not only in spit and polish, but in the superior Australian boot polish, a commodity which was soon exchanged with the Americans on a fluctuating basis of so many packets of cigarettes for one can of Kiwi boot polish.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli was a humanist and {{a scholar}} with many devoted friends and disciples. He communicated as easily with the {{ordinary}} people of his congregation as with rulers such as Philip of Hesse. His {{reputation as a}} stern, stolid reformer is counterbalanced {{by the fact that}} he had an excellent sense of humour and used satiric fables, spoofing, and puns in his writings. He was <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> of social obligations than Luther and he genuinely believed that the masses would accept a government guided by God's word. He tirelessly promoted assistance to the poor, who he believed should be cared for by a truly Christian community.|$|E
5|$|Society {{throughout}} Europe {{was disturbed}} by the dislocations caused by the Black Death. Lands that had been marginally productive were abandoned, as the survivors were able to acquire more fertile areas. Although serfdom declined in Western Europe it became more common in Eastern Europe, as landlords imposed it on those of their tenants who had previously been free. Most peasants in Western Europe managed to change the work they had previously owed to their landlords into cash rents. The percentage of serfs amongst the peasantry declined {{from a high of}} 90 to closer to 50 per cent {{by the end of the}} period. Landlords also became <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> of common interests with other landholders, and they joined together to extort privileges from their governments. Partly at the urging of landlords, governments attempted to legislate a return to the economic conditions that existed before the Black Death. Non-clergy became increasingly literate, and urban populations began to imitate the nobility's interest in chivalry.|$|E

25|$|Implicit {{self-esteem}} {{refers to}} a person's disposition to evaluate themselves positively or negatively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. It contrasts with explicit self-esteem, which entails <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> and reflective self-evaluation.

The most important pre-1895 precursor to the rise of nationalist historiography was the erosion of Sinocentrism during the silhak movement.|$|E
25|$|According to Jung, {{people use}} all four {{cognitive}} functions. However, one function is generally {{used in a}} <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> and confident way. This dominant function {{is supported by the}} secondary (auxiliary) function, and to a lesser degree the tertiary function. The fourth and least conscious function is always the opposite of the dominant function. Myers called this inferior function the shadow.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{like other}} post-industrial nations, the United States saw {{increased}} health consciousness among persons of higher social status. Persons of higher status {{are less likely}} to smoke, more likely to exercise regularly, and be <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> of their diet. Additionally, poorer Americans are more likely to consume lower quality, processed foods. One can therefore conclude that low socio-economic status contributes to a person's likelihood of being obese.|$|E

25|$|Fine Gael's {{proposals}} have sometimes been criticised mostly by smaller political groupings in Ireland, and {{by some of}} the trade unions, who have raised the idea that the party's solutions are <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> of business interests than the interests of the worker. The SIPTU trade union has stated its opposition to the Taoiseach Enda Kenny's assertion, in response to Ireland's economic crisis, that the national wage agreement should be suspended. Kenny's comments had support however and the party attributes its significant rise in polls in 2008 to this.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{proceeding}} by tenet #1 in Answer to Job, Jung interprets Yahweh as an archaic {{form of the}} self, Job as the ego, and Satan as {{the principle}} of individuation. Jung interprets {{the evolution of the}} god-image portrayed in the Old and New Testaments as a process of psychological development: In the Book of Job, the archaic self is prompted to develop toward consciousness by the <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> ego, a process attended by dreams and prophesies (e.g. the Old Testament prophets). The self enters ego-consciousness (the incarnation of God in Jesus of Nazareth), followed by the emergence of the transcendent function (when the Holy Ghost comes to the disciples at Pentecost).|$|E

30|$|Fashion {{leaders have}} greater need for uniqueness, are <b>more</b> fashion <b>conscious,</b> <b>more</b> interested, and more {{involved}} in fashion than are fashion followers (Beaudoin et al. 2000; Phau and Lo 2004; Quigley and Notarantonio 2009; Vernette 2004; Workman and Caldwell 2007; Workman and Cho 2012). Apparel products are products that encourage high involvement, especially among fashion leaders, because {{of their ability to}} express an individual’s identity and emotions (Workman and Freeburg 2009). Information search might be especially useful with high involvement products (Moorthy et al. 1997).|$|R
25|$|The Napoleonic Wars sent Norway into an {{economic}} crisis, as {{nearly all the}} merchants had gone bankrupt during the blockade. Recovery was difficult because of export tariffs and the country experienced high inflation. The Norwegian speciedaler was established as a currency by the Bank of Norway when it was established in 1816, financed through a silver tax which lasted until 1842. Under threat of a coup d'état by Carl Johan, Norway reluctantly paid the debt stated in the Treaty of Kiel, despite never having ratified it. Constitution Day on 17 May became an important political rally every year; in 1829 the Swedish governor-general Baltzar von Platen resigned after he used force against demonstrators in the Battle of the Square. The {{first half of the}} century was dominated by the ca. 2,000 officials, as there were few bourgeois and no aristocracy following an 1821 decision to abolish nobility. From the 1832 election, farmers became <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> of electing themselves, resulting in a majority of farmers in Parliament. This resulted in rural tax cuts and higher import tariffs, shifting the tax burden to the cities. They also passed the Local Committees Act, which established elected municipal councils from 1838. Cultural expression from the 1840s to the 1870s was dominated by the romantic nationalism, which emphasized the uniqueness of Norway.|$|E

Megadeth hired fashion photographer Richard Avedon to enhance the band's image. Avedon had the band members exchange their jeans and T-shirts for a <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> appearance. To promote Youthanasia, the band played a Halloween show in New York City called [...] "Night of the Living Megadeth", which was broadcast live on MTV.

500|$|The album's themes {{revolve around}} events {{which took place}} in 2015, such as the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the British media's {{handling}} of the United Kingdom general election, {{as well as on the}} state of humanity. Lead writer Higgs spent a year writing the album, time he spent watching rolling news and enveloping himself in current events. Pritchard told the London Evening Standard that [...] "we're in an age where we're <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> of [...] you're constantly bombarded by information". Speaking to Chris Parkin of Red Bull, Higgs explained the songwriting process provided a kind of catharsis following the year's events: [...] "It wasn't until after we finished that I looked back and thought, bloody hell, I was feeling that very heavily and I didn't realise until it was out of me." [...] He later described the album as a [...] "horror bible".|$|E

40|$|Brand {{consciousness}} {{is more than}} simply an awareness or preference for brand names. It is the understanding that brand names, in general, have personal rele-vance or value in that they serve as a signal of functional or symbolic value. In the United States, the importance of brand names is well established. However, there is little understanding of the importance brand names hold in other cultures. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to better understand the role brand name plays in consumer decision-making by culture. Moreover, age and gender compar-isons were also analyzed. As the results have indicated, there is no significant difference in the level of brand consciousness between students in Mexico and stu-dents in the United States. However, there were other statistically significant findings: overall, males are <b>more</b> brand <b>conscious</b> than females; Mexican males are more brand consciousness than Mexican females and American males; 11 - 12 year old American males are <b>more</b> brand <b>conscious</b> than 16 - 17 year old and 20 - 22 year old American males; and 20 - 22 year old Mexicans are <b>more</b> brand <b>conscious</b> than 20 - 22 year old Americans...|$|R
500|$|Miss Freda Whitlam (born 1920), {{sister of}} Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was {{principal}} between 1958 and 1976. It {{was a period}} of great social transition. [...] In 1968 Miss Whitlam wrote: 'Ours is a world where each year we become <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> of how quickly and radically our environment is changing. [...] Technology is taking the drudgery out of our lives and opening up exciting opportunities for those who have a good general education and are willing to think positively and creatively. [...] Here we help the girls with this aim in view.' In 1970, after the Rev. Bill McLeod spoke to some of the seniors and advised those intending to become a nurse or a teacher to learn Greek or Italian (to aid communication with immigrants), Miss Whitlam took up the suggestion: 'We have people with time to do something after the exams {{at the end of each}} year - let's organise Greek classes for them'. In March 1972 the school also produced a newsletter ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΑ ΝΕΑ providing background on Greek culture and language and a bibliography of relevant books in the school library.|$|E
500|$|... "Acrobat" [...] {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{personal}} songs on Achtung Baby with Bono acknowledging personal weakness, contradictions, and inadequacy. The Edge noted that the song contained [...] "a bit of venom", likening it to [...] "the bitter, John Lennon tradition of 'Working Class Hero', slightly snarling and cynical." [...] Bono stated [...] "as we moved from the eighties to the nineties, I stopped throwing rocks at the obvious symbols of power and the abuse of it. I started throwing rocks at my own hypocrisy... 'Acrobat' [...] 'Don't believe what you hear, don't believe what you see / If you just close your eyes / You can feel the enemy...' I can't remember it, but the point is: you start to see the world in a different way, and you're part of the problem, not just part of the solution". In 2006, he noted it was [...] "a song about being a hypocrite, and I think we all can be and I certainly have been. And you know, you exact very high standards on people in the world but then you don't live them personally", noting the theme was most evident in the lyric [...] "I must be an acrobat to talk like this and act like that". Hot Press editor Niall Stokes felt The Edge's guitar playing combined elements of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] with [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky". Speaking of its theme he said [...] "at its heart is an awareness of the ravages of time, and what it does to people and to relationships. But beyond that, there is the self-awareness that, itself, comes only with experience... Bono acknowledges his own weakness and inadequacy. He is <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> now than ever before of the contradictions in his own position." [...] Andy Greene of Rolling Stone believed the [...] "aggressive and venomous" [...] song reflected Bono's thoughts during the album sessions, saying [...] "Nearly every lyric brims with rage... It was a new decade and it was quite possible they were about to be dismissed as a relic of the past." ...|$|E
500|$|It remains disputed to {{this day}} how the Anglo-German {{cooperation}} on Venezuela came about, with varying opinions as {{to the source of}} the initiative. In mid-1901, with the distraction of the Boxer Rebellion gone, Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow decided to respond to the German concerns in Venezuela with some form of military intervention, and discussed with the German navy the feasibility of a blockade. Admiral Otto von Diederichs was keen, and recommended occupying Caracas if a blockade didn't succeed. However, disagreements within the German government over whether a blockade should be pacific (permitting neutral ships to pass) or martial (enabling them to be seized) caused delays, and in any case Kaiser Wilhelm II, German Emperor was unconvinced about the military action. Nonetheless, in late 1901 a renewed demand for reparations was backed up by a show of naval strength, with Vineta and Falke sent to the Venezuelan coast. In January 1902 the Kaiser declared a delay to any blockade due to the outbreak of another civil war in Venezuela (led by financier [...] ) which raised the possibility of a more amenable government. [...] Complicating matters were rumours [...] "rampant in the United States and in England" [...] that Germany wanted Margarita Island as a South American naval base; however a May 1900 visit by the German cruiser SMS Vineta had concluded it was unsuitable, and the German navy had become <b>more</b> <b>conscious</b> of how vulnerable such far-flung bases would be. In late 1901, the British Foreign Office became concerned that Britain would look bad if it failed to defend its citizens' interests while Germany took care of theirs, and began sounding out the Germans about a possible common action, initially receiving a negative response. By early 1902, British and German financiers were working together to pressure their respective governments into action. The Italians, who had begun to suspect the existence of plans to enforce debts, sought to be involved too, but Berlin refused. Their participation was agreed to by the British [...] "after Rome had shrewdly pointed out that it could repay the favor in Somalia".|$|E
