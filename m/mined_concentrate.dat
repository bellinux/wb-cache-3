This is a desert region with limited water resources; therefore, the mining sector requires research and identification of alternative sources of water.

This work determines the influence of seawater on the solid-liquid equilibrium for acid solutions of copper sulfate at different temperatures (293. 15 to 318. 15 K), and its effect on physical properties (density, viscosity, and solubility).

50|$|In 1895, southeastern Alaska was {{the first}} part of the Territory of Alaska to have its mineral {{resources}} researched by the U.S. Geological Survey. It surveyed the gold deposit areas of Juneau and Sitka. Systematic surveying began in 1902 which included a topographic map of the gold-bearing area adjacent to Juneau. In the following year, a detailed map of the Juneau region's geology was mapped in detail. A reconnaissance of almost the entire Juneau gold belt was carried out from Port Houghton to the boundary with Canada; in 1904, another reconnaissance, this time of nearby Admiralty Island, was conducted, concentrating on ore deposits and economic geology.

Many uranium occurrences had long been known there and were accessible using the old adits and shafts from the silver and base metal mining of former centuries. In 1950 the giant ore deposit of Ronneburg and the medium-sized Culmitzsch deposit (both in eastern Thuringia) were discovered and in 1965 the Königstein deposit in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. The peak of uranium production by the Wismut company occurred from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, reaching nearly 7,000 tonnes of uranium per year, after which it declined to 3,500 tonnes in the last normal production year, 1989.|$|R
50|$|Historical <b>mining</b> <b>concentrated</b> {{mostly on}} {{precious}} stone production, {{with some of}} the oldest known mines in the world believed to have been established in Afghanistan. Lapis lazuli was being mined in the Badakhshan province of Afghanistan as early as 8000 BC. In ancient Egypt, lapis lazuli was a favorite stone for amulets and ornaments such as scarabs and was used in Egypt's pyramids; it was also used in ancient Mesopotamia by the Sumerians, Akkadians, Assyrians, Babylonians for seals and at neolithic burials in Mehrgarh. During the height of the Indus valley civilization in about 2000 BC, the Harappan colony now known as Shortugai was established near the lapis mines. Lapis jewelry has been found at excavations of the Predynastic Egyptian site Naqada (3300-3100 BC), and powdered lapis was used as eyeshadow by Cleopatra. In ancient Mesopotamia, Lapis artifacts can be found in great abundance, with many notable examples having been excavated at the Royal Cemetery of Ur (2600-2500 BC).|$|R
40|$|Most {{previously}} proposed mining methods on data streams make {{an unrealistic}} assumption that “labelled” data stream {{is readily available}} and can be mined at anytime. However, in most real-world problems, labelled data streams are rarely immediately available. Due to this reason, models are reconstructed only when labelled data become available periodically. This passive stream mining model has several drawbacks. We propose a new concept of demand-driven active data mining. In active mining, {{the loss of the}} model is either continuously guessed without using any true class labels or estimated, whenever necessary, from a small number of instances whose actual class labels are verified by paying an affordable cost. When the estimated loss is more than a tolerable threshold, the model evolves by using a small number of instances with verified true class labels. Previous work on active <b>mining</b> <b>concentrates</b> on error guess and estimation. In this paper, we discuss several approaches on decision tree evolution. ...|$|R

Relatively unknown dust suppression chemicals and innovative aerodynamic modifications to haulage truck fender designs were tested on a Minnesota sand and gravel operation haulage road. Magnesium chloride salt at 95 -pct control efficiency and a petroleum derivative at 70 -pct control efficiency were effective in suppressing dust generated by haulage vehicles; however, none of the fender modifications were successful. Commonly used dust suppressant chemicals were tested on a Minnesota taconite tailing basin to reduce the dust lift-off during {{the spring and fall}} dry seasons. The most successful chemical was lignin sulfonate with a seasonal cost of less than $ 200 per acre to achieve 90 -pct dust control.

40|$|Top-k {{frequent}} pattern {{discovery is}} indeed an association analysis concerning automatic extraction of the k most correlated and interesting patterns from large databases. Current studies in association <b>mining</b> <b>concentrate</b> {{on how to}} effectively find all objects that are frequently co-occurring. Given a set of objects with m features, there are almost 2 m frequent patterns to consider. For DNA data that are normally very high in dimensionality, frequent pattern discovery from genetic data is obviously a computationally expensive problem. We therefore devise an approximate approach to tackle this problem. We propose an approximate method based on the window sliding concept to estimate data density and obtain data characteristics from a small set of samples. Then we draw a set of representatives with reservoir sampling technique. These representatives are subsequently used in the main process of frequent pattern mining. Our designed algorithm had been implemented with the Erlang language, which is the functional programming paradigm with inherent support for pattern matching. The experimental results confirm the efficiency and reliability of our approximate method...|$|R
