500|$|When Arsenal {{moved to}} the Emirates Stadium, the club prioritised repaying the loans over {{strengthening}} the playing squad. Arsenal's self-sustaining model relied heavily on qualifying for the UEFA Champions League; as Wenger recalled in 2016: [...] "We had to be {{three years in the}} Champions League out of five and have an average of 54,000 people, and we didn’t know we would be capable of that." [...] The club sold several experienced players throughout the late 2000s and early 2010s and raised ticket prices, upsetting supporters who have called for change. Wenger took umbrage over criticism and revealed the bank loans were contingent on his commitment to the club: [...] "The banks wanted the technical consistency to guarantee that {{we have a chance to}} pay [...] back. I did commit and I stayed and under very difficult circumstances. So for me to come back and on top of that [...] reproach <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> having won the championship during that period it is a bit overboard." [...] Wenger later described the stadium move as the toughest period of his life because of the restricted finances in place.|$|E
2500|$|As he {{was playing}} out his legal options, Idema said that another reason he hadn't left was because he feared for his life, ostensibly {{at the hands of}} the Afghan government. [...] "I could drive through the Policharki [...] gates right now. Then what happens? I get arrested. [...] will arrest <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> having an Afghan visa and they'll torture me and kill me. If I'm lucky, I'm only going to be tortured," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Wahlberg {{offered his}} own opinion of The Happening in 2010, saying that Amy Adams, {{who was in}} {{consideration}} {{for the role of}} Alma Moore, had [...] "dodged the bullet" [...] by not starring in the film. He said, [...] "It was a really bad movie... Fuck it. It is what it is. Fucking trees, man. The plants. Fuck it. You can’t blame <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> wanting to try to play a science teacher. At least I wasn’t playing a cop or a crook." ...|$|E

2500|$|Greig {{was born}} to a Scottish {{immigrant}} father and a South African-born mother, and was educated at Queen's College, Queenstown, South Africa. Many former Sussex players had been recruited to coach the cricket team at Queen's College—during Greig's schooldays, Jack Oakes, Alan Oakman, Ian Thomson, Ron Bell, Richard Langridge and Mike Buss all came from overseas for off-season work. All of them noticed Greig's developing abilities which, after a first-class debut for Border Province in the Currie Cup, led to a trial at Sussex when Greig was 19. Greig's father helped him decide between university study or pursuit of the Sussex offer. [...] "He used to slam into <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> reading enough, for being generally immature. He {{would look at me}} sometimes and say 'Boy, when I was your age I was fighting a war', but in the end he grinned and said: 'Go over to England for one year, one year mind, and see what you can do'".|$|E
2500|$|Jones was {{not only}} a consummately skilled golfer but {{exemplified}} the principles of sportsmanship and fair play. In {{the first round of the}} 1925 U.S. Open at the Worcester Country Club near Boston, his approach shot to the 11th hole's elevated green fell short into the deep rough of the embankment. As he took his stance to pitch onto the green, the head of his club brushed the grass and caused a slight movement of the ball. He took the shot, then informed his playing partner Walter Hagen and the USGA official covering their match that he was calling a penalty on himself. Hagen was unable to talk him out of it, and they continued play. [...] After the round and before he signed his scorecard, officials argued with Jones but he insisted that he had violated Rule 18, moving a ball at rest after address, and took a 77 instead of the 76 he otherwise would have carded. Jones' self-imposed one-stroke penalty eventually cost him the win by a stroke in regulation, necessitating a playoff, which he then lost. Although praised by many sports writers for his gesture, Jones was reported to have said, [...] "You might as well praise <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> robbing banks." ...|$|E
