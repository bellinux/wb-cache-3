30|$|Nitriles, organic {{compounds}} containing (−CN) functional group, are {{widespread in the}} environment. Naturally occurring nitriles mainly comprise cyanoglycosides, cyanolipids and phenylacetonitrile (Marron et al. 2012) that are produced as defensive metabolites in plants. In the chemical industry, nitriles are extensively used as feedstocks, solvents, polymers, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and drug intermediates. Nitriles are also important intermediates in the organic synthesis of amides, amines, carboxylic acids, esters and ketones (Gong et al. 2012; Kobayashi and Shimizu 2000). Bio- and chemo-catalyzed transformations of nitrile substrates lead {{to the formation of}} several industrially important amides and organic acids, such as acrylamide, nicotinamide, acrylic and <b>mandelic</b> <b>acids,</b> methacrylic acid (Xue et al. 2011). The biocatalytic route is of particular interest because the nitrile-degrading enzymes like nitrilases, amidases and nitrile hydratases (−NHases) can convert diverse nitrile substrates into various amides and carboxylic acids under relatively moderate process conditions with excellent chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivities (Babu and Shilpi 2010). Nitrilase-mediated biocatalysis has gained substantial attention for the development of sustainable green technologies for the production of selective and complex active ingredients in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Nitrilases catalyse direct cleavage of nitriles to corresponding acids and ammonia (Gong et al. 2012).|$|R

Seventy-five workers from a fiberglass-reinforced plastics factory and 77 unexposed controls took part in the study. The mean air concentration of styrene in the breathing zone of workers (30. 4 ppm) and the mean concentration of urinary metabolites (MA + PGA = 443 ± 44 mg/g creatinine) exceeded the threshold limit value (TLV) and the biological exposure index (BEI). Significantly higher SCE frequency rate and DNA damage were observed in exposed workers, but MN frequency was not markedly modified by exposure.

About 68 % of the dose (somewhat more than 4 mmol) of styrene was taken up.

40|$|ABSTRAcr The {{results of}} the {{analysis}} of blood and urine samples for styrene and its metabolites in 491 workers in a styrene polymerisation plant in the United States are reported. The levels of exposure to styrene were estimated {{to be less than}} 10 ppm, but nevertheless styrene and metabolites were detectable in more than 50 % of workers in polymerisation jobs, within 4 h of exposure. Workers involved in the manufacture and purification of styrene from ethyl benzene also had detect-able blood styrene and urinary metabolites in 83 % of recently exposed subjects. The relationship between styrene in blood and in subcutaneous fat and urinary metabolites as pharmacokinetic variables is discussed. Various indices of human exposure to organic solvents have been investigated in recent years in recognition of the fact that air sample analysis, even at best, may be an inadequate measure of individual environmental exposure. This results from the fre-quent difficulty of obtaining an accurate or repre-sentative pessonal sample and of the many changes in levels of exposure during actual working con-ditions over short periods of time. At the same time the non-uniformity of human responses, even to similar exposure levels, has been noted. Individual variation in absorption, distribution, storage, metabolism and excretion can be marked. Efforts to assess individual exposure quantita-tively have dealt with measurement of unaltered materials (such as styrene, benzene, dichloromethane, trichloroethylene and various anaesthetics) in ex-pired air and blood, and of urinary metabolites including trichloroacetic acid (for trichloroethylene), phenols (for benzene), hippuric acid (for toluene), and <b>mandelic</b> or phenylglyoxylic <b>acid</b> (for styrene...|$|R

Fragmentation under flash vacuum pyrolysis (FVP) conditions occurred in the expected way (loss of Bu([superscript]t) CHO and CO) in the latter case, but in the former reductive cyclisation was used to generate functionalised lactams. An unexpected reaction of a dioxolanone anion with the dioxolanone to afford an aldol-like dimer was observed in one case. Attempts to extend the range of dioxolanones by using amino acid-derived α-hydroxy acids met with limited success. Only the 5 -benzyl compound derived from phenylalanine was obtained in reasonable yield and an attempt to alkylate it led again to aldol-like dimerisation. 	Cycloaddition to the double bond of 2 -t-butyl- 5 -methylene- 1, 3 -dioxolan- 4 -one was used {{to gain access to}} a range of novel spiro bicyclic and polycyclic systems and fragmentation of these was expected to provide products resulting from a chiral ketene equivalent. While the epoxide derived from the cyclopentadiene Diels Alder adduct did behave in this way to give the chiral ketone in high e. e., the corresponding aziridine underwent unexpected isomerisation pointing to a stepwise fragmentation mechanism of possible general applicability in these systems. Adducts were also formed with tetracyclone and 1, 3 -diphenylisobenzofuran and an interesting pattern of exo/endo selectivity was observed in these cases. With tetrachlorothiophene dioxide the adduct again fragmented in an unexpected way to give tetrachlorobenzoic acid, providing further support for the intermediacy of an oxonium carboxylate species. 	 1, 3 -Dipolar cycloaddition to 2 -t-butyl- 5 -methylene- 1, 3 -dioxolan- 4 -one was achieved {{for the first time and}} a range of adducts containing novel spiro heterocyclic ring systems derived from nitrile oxides, nitrones and diazo compounds were obtained and characterised.

Genomics, 16, 87 – 99] we present now data on a cross-sectional investigation involving a homogeneous group of subjects for which data on both somatic and germ cells have been obtained from individuals (42 exposed and 25 controls). Somatic cell genotoxicity was assessed by analysing the frequency of micronucleated binucleated cells (MNBN) in blood lymphocytes. The micronucleus assay was coupled with centromeric fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Primary DNA damage in germ cells was evaluated by alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet assay) and the percentage of the tail DNA (%TD) was used as parameter of Comet evaluation. Moreover, to investigate the frequencies of aneuploidy and diploidy in sperm, we performed multicolour FISH, using DNA probes specific for the centromeric regions of sex chromosomes and chromosome 2, in decondensed sperm nuclei of samples with normal semen parameters in a subgroup of individuals. <b>Mandelic</b> and phenylglyoxylic <b>acids</b> (MAPGA) in end of shift samples were determined as biomarkers of internal dose. MAPGA excretion was consistent with an exposure to styrene above the threshold limit value-time weighted average concentration of 20 p. p. m. Styrene workers showed significantly higher frequency ofMNBN as compared to controls (13. 8 6 5. 2 versus 6. 2 6 5. 1; P < 0. 001), due to higher proportions of both micronuclei (MN) arising from chromosomal breakage (CMN) and harbouring whole chromosomes (C 1 MN). DNA damage in sperm cells was also higher among styrene-exposed, the %TD being 11. 02 6 2. 99 versus 7. 42 6 2. 30 in controls (P < 0. 001). The incidence of aneuploidy and diploidy for the tested chromosomes in sperm did not show a statistically significant difference between workers and controls.

Although cytogenetic biomarkers detected both in somatic and germ cells were interrelated, no relationships were apparent with exposure parameters. Styrene exposure may increase the likelihood of both chromosome and DNA damage in somatic and germ cells, thus supporting the hypothesis of an interference on reproductive capacity among exposed workers.
