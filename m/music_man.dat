5|$|Balzac {{has also}} {{influenced}} popular culture. Many {{of his works}} have been made into popular films and television serials, including: Travers Vale's Père Goriot (1915), Les Chouans (1947), Le Père Goriot (1968 BBC mini-series), and La Cousine Bette (1974 BBC mini-series, starring Margaret Tyzack and Helen Mirren; 1998 film, starring Jessica Lange). Balzac is mentioned to humorous effect in Meredith Willson's musical The <b>Music</b> <b>Man.</b> He is included in François Truffaut's 1959 film, The 400 Blows. Truffaut believed Balzac and Proust {{to be the greatest}} French writers.|$|E

The guitar solo and guitar rhythm sections were recorded in one take, while a four-track tape machine amplified them on the recording. Sound engineer Shelly Yakus remembers piecing together the separate vocals, guitar and rhythm section into a master track, with the overdubbing occurring in that order.|$|E

5|$|Guitar Hero II {{features}} many popular {{real world}} Gibson, Epiphone, and Kramer guitars, including the Gibson Les Paul, Gibson SG, Gibson Flying V, (these three {{being the only}} ones available from the start) Gibson Sonex 180 and Gibson Explorer. Oddities such as the double necked Gibson EDS-1275 and unusual looking Gibson Corvus also make an appearance. Several available finishes are also recognizable from popular guitarists, including Zakk Wylde's bullseye Les Paul. As play progresses, several custom shaped guitars become available, although some are notable {{in the real world}} such as the USA and Battle Axe (a similar looking bass is played by Gene Simmons, and the guitar was played by John Christ of Samhain/Danzig fame). Basses, such as the <b>Music</b> <b>Man</b> StingRay, Gibson Thunderbird, and the Höfner bass (as made famous by Paul McCartney, the bassist for the Beatles) are also available for co-op play.|$|E

25|$|Initially, <b>Music</b> <b>Man</b> {{concentrated}} {{solely on}} production of its high-end, US-built instruments, refusing {{to enter the}} budget instrument market. In the late 1990s, the demand for cheaper versions of <b>Music</b> <b>Man</b> instruments had increased and other companies had begun to exploit this market-gap by producing replica instruments, built from inexpensive woods and components in various East-Asian countries. <b>Music</b> <b>Man</b> responded by licensing its designs to HHI/Davitt & Hanser, launching OLP (Officially Licensed Products) to give <b>Music</b> <b>Man</b> market coverage in this price point.|$|E
