40|$|Mothers’ {{spontaneous}} {{teaching of}} their 4 -year-olds was observed during block play in 230 dyads from low-income African American, Mexican, Dominican, and Chinese backgrounds. Blocks contained graphics {{that could be}} used to teach concepts in literacy, math, construction, or body/color. Coders noted how often <b>mothers</b> <b>taught</b> each of the concepts, and whether they taught at basic (“This is an ‘A’”) or advanced (“C-a-t spells cat”) levels.

Ethnic differences were seen in the concepts that <b>mothers</b> <b>taught,</b> the levels of their teaching, and the amount and valence of mothers’ feedback and affect towards their children. Within immigrant families, English-language use was positively associated with amount of teaching, engagement in advanced teaching, and feedback to children.

The Lateran Canons were one of several institutions born out of a fifteenth-century religious reform movement. They emphasized strict discipline, and moved from house to house rather than remaining in one place. They also sought to provide leadership in urban areas.

5|$|Harland Sanders {{was born}} in 1890 and raised on a farm outside Henryville, Indiana (near Louisville, Kentucky). When Sanders was five years old, his father died, forcing his mother {{to work at a}} canning plant. This left Sanders, as the eldest son, to care for his two younger siblings. After he reached seven years of age, his <b>mother</b> <b>taught</b> him how to cook. After leaving the family home at the age of 13, Sanders passed through several professions, with mixed success. In 1930, he took over a Shell filling station on US Route 25 just outside North Corbin, Kentucky, a small town {{on the edge of the}} Appalachian Mountains. It was here that he first served to {{travelers}} the recipes that he had learned as a child: fried chicken and other dishes such as steaks and country ham. After four years of serving from his own dining room table, Sanders purchased the larger filling station on the other side of the road and expanded to six tables.

5|$|Plante {{was born}} on a farm near Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel, in Mauricie, Quebec, the first of 11 {{children}} born to Palma and Xavier Plante. The family moved to Shawinigan Falls, where his father worked {{in one of the}} local factories. In 1932, Plante began to play hockey, skateless and with a tennis ball, using a goaltender's hockey stick his father had carved from a tree root. When he was five years old, Plante fell off a ladder and broke his hand. The fracture failed to heal properly and affected his playing style during his early hockey career; he underwent successful corrective surgery as an adult. Plante suffered from asthma starting in early childhood. This prevented him from skating for extended periods so he gravitated to playing goaltender. As his playing progressed, Jacques received his first regulation goaltender's stick for Christmas of 1936. His father made Plante's first pads by stuffing potato sacks and reinforcing them with wooden panels. As a child, Plante played hockey outdoors in the bitterly cold Quebec winters. His <b>mother</b> <b>taught</b> him how to knit his own tuques to protect him from the cold. Plante continued knitting and embroidering throughout his life and wore his hand-knitted tuques while playing and practicing until entering the National Hockey League (NHL).|$|E
