60|$|Frank saw two slim shadows {{shoot out}} beneath a wreath of {{circling}} foam and flash--which seemed the best word for it--through the crystal {{depths of the}} slacker part of the pool. They {{were lost in the}} snowy turmoil near the foot of the fall, and a few minutes passed before he saw them again. Then one shot out of the water like a bow that had suddenly straightened itself, gleamed resplendent with silver, and plunged into the foam again. Harry pointed him out the other, and though it was a moment or two before he could see it he <b>marveled</b> <b>when</b> he did. It had its dusky back toward him, for now and then the dorsal fin rose clear, and it was swimming up a thin cascade which poured down a steep slope of stone. That any creature should have strength enough to stem that rush of water seemed incredible, but there was no doubt that the fish was ascending inch by inch. Then it found a momentary harbor in a little pool just outside the main leap of the fall, and shot out of it again with its curious uncurving spring. Frank watched it eagerly when it dropped into the fall, and it was with a sense of sympathy that he saw its gallant efforts wasted as it was suddenly swept down. Before reaching the bottom, however, it had evidently rallied all its powers, for it flashed clear into the sunlight, and had recovered a fathom when he lost sight of it once more.|$|E
50|$|Brutus <b>marveled</b> <b>when</b> {{he saw the}} gash on {{her thigh}} and after hearing this he no longer hid {{anything}} from her, but felt strengthened himself and promised to relate the whole plot. Lifting his hands above him, {{he is said to}} have prayed that he might succeed in his undertaking and thus show himself a worthy husband. Yet Brutus never got the chance as they were interrupted and never had a moment's privacy before the conspiracy was carried out. On the day of Caesar's assassination, Porcia was extremely disturbed with anxiety and sent messengers to the Senate to check that Brutus was still alive. She worked herself up to the point whereupon her fainting, her maids feared that she was dying.|$|E
50|$|He was {{residing}} in Newport in 1778, when the French squadron under Count d'Estaing was blockaded {{there by the}} greatly superior British fleet under Admiral Howe. A sudden and dense fog prevented an immediate attack by the English; but they occupied both entrances to the harbor, and waited for daylight. Captain Gardner had noted from his housetop, through a spy-glass, the disposition of the hostile fleets, and, {{as soon as it}} was dark, rowed himself to the ship of the French admiral, offered to pilot him to a safe position, and with his own hand steered the admiral's ship through a channel which he had known from boyhood, the other vessels, with all lights extinguished, following singly in his wake. Having piloted the French beyond the enemy and to clear water, he returned to the island, reached his own house before daylight, and was among the groups along the water-front who <b>marveled,</b> <b>when</b> the fog lifted, at the disappearance of the French fleet.|$|E
6000|$|RELIEVER. So after a {{few more}} words, this Reliever said as followeth: I <b>marveled</b> much <b>when</b> you were entertained at the gate above, being, [as] ye knew, that ye were but weak women, that you petitioned not the Lord there for a conductor; then might you have avoided these {{troubles}} and dangers, for He would have granted you one.[62] ...|$|R
60|$|But {{a greater}} {{surprise}} was {{in store for}} them. As they neared the wagons, now formed into a circle with {{a certain degree of}} military formality, they could see that the appointments of the strange party were larger and more liberal than their own, or indeed anything they had ever known of the kind. Forty or fifty horses were tethered within the circle, and the camp fires were already blazing. Before one of them a large tent was erected, and through the parted flaps could be seen a table actually spread with a white cloth. Was it a school feast, or was this their ordinary household arrangement? Clarence and Susy thought of their own dinners, usually laid on bare boards beneath the sky, or under the low hood of the wagon in rainy weather, and <b>marveled.</b> And <b>when</b> they finally halted, and were lifted from their horses, and passed one wagon fitted up as a bedroom and another as a kitchen, they could only nudge each other with silent appreciation. But here again the difference already noted in the quality of the sensations of the two children was observable. Both were equally and agreeably surprised. But Susy's wonder was merely the sense of novelty and inexperience, and a slight disbelief in the actual necessity of what she saw; while Clarence, whether from some previous general experience or peculiar temperament, had the conviction that what he saw here was the usual custom, and what he had known with the Silsbees was the novelty. The feeling was attended with a slight sense of wounded pride for Susy, as if her enthusiasm had exposed her to ridicule.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{theme for}} the Lectures for 1934, “The New Testament Church in History,” is a very timely one and follows {{naturally}} {{the theme of the}} 1933 Lectures, “The Church We Read About in the New Testament. ” There is no subject that is so vital in our work as Christians today as a proper understanding of the great spiritual kingdom of our Savior, the church which was built by Jesus Christ. It is a hard lesson to teach because all people are so dull of hearing concerning things spiritual. Just as Nicodemus <b>marveled</b> <b>when</b> the Christ told him of the spiritual kingdom so do people today wonder and marvel when they are told {{that there is only one}} great church, the spiritual kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and that all the saved of earth belong to that church and that belonging to anything else profits little, and is unnecessary. Not only are numbers of denominational churches and people who have no religious affiliation ignorant of the true meaning of the church, but even those who claim to be members of the one body are lacking in understanding concerning the kingdom of Christ. It is therefore the purpose of the Abilene College Lectures last year, this year and next year to arouse a greater interest in the study and the teaching of this very vital matter. In this particular volume much valuable information is brought together on the trials and struggles of the church from its foundations to the present. The speakers have made careful preparation on their subjects and have given lessons that should prove helpful to all who desire to have a better understanding of the church. Our prayer is that these Lectures may be read by many and that they may do much good in the name of the Christ. Jas. F. Cox,President, Abilene Christian College. Nov. 6, 1934...|$|E
