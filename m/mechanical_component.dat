5|$|Any <b>mechanical</b> <b>component</b> will unavoidably possess both {{mass and}} stiffness. This {{translates}} in electrical terms to an LC circuit, that is, a circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, hence mechanical components are resonators {{and are often}} used as such. It is still possible to represent inductors and capacitors as individual lumped elements in a mechanical implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. Capacitors may be made of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may be made of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass {{in comparison to the}} compliance of the piece.|$|E

The {{variation}} {{rules of}} strength, load, {{and reliability of}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>components</b> are studied with a change in time, and a model is established for dynamic reliability of <b>mechanical</b> <b>components</b> under the random load acting. By combining the theory of reliability design with the method of sensitivity analysis, the computational method of dynamic reliability sensitivity design with arbitrary distribution parameter is proposed based on the methods Edgeworth and perturbation, {{and the problem of}} dynamic reliability sensitivity design of <b>mechanical</b> <b>components</b> distributed arbitrary distribution is solved as well as the variation rules of dynamic reliability sensitivity are given. The variation of reliability is studied as design parameters change a little, which provides theoretical data for dynamic reliability design of <b>mechanical</b> <b>components...</b>|$|R

500|$|Expressing the {{behaviour}} of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>component</b> as a two-port or multi-port with {{a transfer}} matrix {{is a useful}} thing to do because, like electrical circuits, the component can often be operated in reverse and its behaviour {{is dependent on the}} loads at the inputs and outputs. [...] For instance, a gear train is often characterised simply by its gear ratio, a SISO transfer function. [...] However, the gearbox output shaft can be driven round to turn the input shaft requiring a MIMO analysis.

500|$|The {{mechanical}} analogies of lumped electrical {{elements are}} also lumped elements, that is, {{it is assumed}} that the <b>mechanical</b> <b>component</b> possessing the element is small enough [...] that the time taken by mechanical waves to propagate {{from one end of the}} component to the other can be neglected. [...] Analogies can also be developed for distributed elements such as transmission lines but the greatest benefits are with lumped element circuits. [...] Mechanical analogies are required for the three passive electrical elements, namely, resistance, inductance and capacitance. [...] What these analogies are is determined by what mechanical property is chosen to represent effort, the analogy of voltage, and the property chosen to represent flow, the analogy of current.

500|$|Inertance has {{the same}} units as mass (kilograms in the SI system) and the name {{indicates}} its relationship to inertia. [...] Smith did not just define a network theoretic element, he also suggested a construction for a real <b>mechanical</b> <b>component</b> and made a small prototype. [...] Smith's inerter consists of a plunger able to slide {{in or out of}} a cylinder. [...] The plunger is connected to a rack and pinion gear which drives a flywheel inside the cylinder. [...] There can be two counter-rotating flywheels in order to prevent a torque developing. [...] Energy provided in pushing the plunger in will be returned when the plunger moves in the opposite direction, hence the device stores energy rather than dissipates it just like a block of mass. [...] However, the actual mass of the inerter can be very small, an ideal inerter has no mass. [...] Two points on the inerter, the plunger and the cylinder case, can be independently connected {{to other parts of the}} mechanical system with neither of them necessarily connected to ground.|$|E
500|$|After {{watching}} {{footage of}} whale movement, Conti {{determined that the}} models could be simplified by making {{the front of the}} whale entirely rigid, relying on the tail and fins for movement. Conti showed footage of the operation of a [...] prototype to Paramount executives, who according to Conti, [...] "loved it... It really knocked them out." [...] With Paramount's approval, ILM hired marine author, conservationist and illustrator Pieter Folkens to sculpt a realistic whale exterior. ILM decided on a finished model size of —the size prevented delicate components like the tail from buckling under stress—and fitted it with mechanics and radio equipment required for control and operation. To prevent water from ruining the whale's electronics, the modelmakers sealed every individual <b>mechanical</b> <b>component</b> rather than attempting to waterproof the entire whale. Balloons and lead weights were added to achieve the proper balance and buoyancy. The finished models were put in the swimming pool of Serra High School in San Mateo, California, for two weeks of shooting; the operation of the whales required four handlers and divers with video cameras to help set up the shots. Accurately controlling the whales was difficult because of the murky water—ILM added diatomaceous earth to the water to match realistic ocean visibility. For a few shots, such as the whales' breaching the water {{towards the end of the}} film, the creatures were represented by life-size animatronics shot at Paramount.|$|E
