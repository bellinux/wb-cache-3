5|$|The {{definition}} of leg before wicket (lbw) is currently Law 36 in the Laws of Cricket, {{written by the}} Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Before a batsman can be dismissed lbw, the fielding team must appeal to the umpire. If the bowler delivers a no ball — an illegal delivery — the batsman cannot be out lbw under any circumstances. Otherwise, for the batsman to be adjudged lbw, the ball, if it bounces, must pitch in line with or on the off side of the wickets. Then the ball must strike part of the batsman's body without first touching his bat, {{in line with the}} wickets and have been going on to hit the stumps. The batsman may also be out lbw if, having made no attempt to hit the ball with his bat, he is struck outside the line of off stump by a ball that would have hit the wickets. The umpire <b>must</b> <b>assume</b> that the ball would have continued on the same trajectory after striking the batsman, even if it would have bounced before hitting the stumps.|$|E

Hell has attained control, transforming purgatory into a dark, seedy city. The last of the seven archangels, Gabriel (Andy Whitfield), endeavors to discover what has become of his comrades and to restore the Light.|$|E

25|$|Fromm’s pathography follows largely Sigmund Freud's {{concept of}} {{psychoanalysis}} and states that Hitler was an immature, self-centered dreamer {{who did not}} overcome his childish narcissism; {{as a result of}} his lack of adaptation to reality he was exposed to humiliations which he tried do overcome by means of lust-ridden destructiveness ("necrophilia"). The evidence of this desire to destroy – including the so-called Nero Decree – was so outrageous that one <b>must</b> <b>assume</b> that Hitler had not only acted destructively, but was driven by a “destructive character”.|$|E
25|$|Using {{satellite}} imagery {{in combination with}} GIS and on-the-ground studies, {{it is possible to}} generate maps of likely occurrences of future landslides. Such maps should show the locations of previous events as well as clearly indicate the probable locations of future events. In general, to predict landslides, one <b>must</b> <b>assume</b> that their occurrence is determined by certain geologic factors, and that future landslides will occur under the same conditions as past events. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a relationship between the geomorphologic conditions in which the past events took place and the expected future conditions.|$|E
25|$|Mass flow meters: The {{equations}} {{required for}} calculating rates of oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide production {{assume that the}} flow rates {{into and out of}} the chambers are known exactly. We use mass flow meters which have the advantage of yielding flow rates independent of temperature and air pressure. Therefore, these flow rates can be considered to be corrected to standard conditions (Standard Temperature Pressure). We only measure and control flow at one location—downstream from the chamber. Therefore, we <b>must</b> <b>assume</b> that the inflow and outflow rates are identical. However, during construction of the respirometry system, flow rate must be measured at all steps, across all connections, to verify integrity of flow.|$|E

25|$|The {{distance}} the insect falls between wingbeats {{depends on how}} rapidly its wings are beating. If the insect flaps its wings at a slow rate, the time interval during which the lifting force is zero is longer, and therefore the insect falls farther than if its wings were beating rapidly. One can calculate the wingbeat frequency necessary for the insect to maintain a given stability in its amplitude. To simplify the calculations, one <b>must</b> <b>assume</b> that the lifting force is at a finite constant value while the wings are moving down {{and that it is}} zero while the wings are moving up. During the time interval Δt of the upward wingbeat, the insect drops a distance h under the influence of gravity.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the majority}} were completed by Jan, from an overall design by Hubert, who probably oversaw the construction {{of most of the}} frames. A number of difficulties present themselves, not least that there is no surviving work confidently attributed to Hubert, and it is thus impossible to detect his style. Instead, art historians have resorted to comparing individual passages to known works by Jan, looking for stylistic differences that might indicate the work of another hand. Advances in Dendrochronology have for example established that parts of the wing panels were felled around 1421. Allowing a seasoning time of at least 10 years, we <b>must</b> <b>assume</b> a completion date well after Hubert's death in 1426, thus ruling out his hand from large portions of the wings.|$|E

As they enter the village, Hilde recalls working hard in the fields to harvest the crop left behind by farmers to have enough food for their large family. She remembers the hunger pains and how her father could not find work. She remembers Fritzi, a member of her apartment-style household, bringing eggs and bacon on Sundays from the farmers and how she had felt proud carrying the basket into the kitchen. She had wanted her mother to be more proud of her than she was of her older and prettier sister, Monika.|$|E

25|$|As a brief example, Frame {{uses the}} {{epistemology}} of Kant, who taught that {{the categories of}} thought that are necessary for our understanding the world around us, such as causality, logic, time, space, and order, are structured by our minds and imposed upon the things we experience. In order to be rational and {{make sense out of}} life we <b>must</b> <b>assume,</b> or presuppose, these notions. Because we cannot empirically verify these categories by touch, smell, sight, etc. they must be thought of as created by and arising from our minds, thus ordering and providing the criterion for those things that we can empirically verify. This led Kant to conclude that if we are to think of anything at all we must think in terms of everything being caused by something logically and temporally prior to it. This led to a fairly deterministic view of mankind.|$|E
25|$|The third first-person {{narration}} from Alhambra follows, {{which is}} much the same as the second. We then have “The End”, which takes us to the Smart home once they return from holiday. The house has been emptied of all possessions – we <b>must</b> <b>assume,</b> as the family do, by Amber – leaving nothing but the answering machine, which contains messages forcing Magnus, Michael and Eve to face up to their past. Magnus and Astrid seem freed and excited by the experience of losing their possessions, their past – Michael also seems to find some redemption. Eve, however, runs away from the family, embarking on a round-the-world tour – eventually ending up in America, where she goes in search of her old family home. “The End” ends, ominously, with Eve seeming to take up Amber’s mantle, arriving at someone’s house as an uninvited guest. The book then finishes with a short section from Alhambra, reinforcing her connection to the cinema.|$|E
25|$|Another {{clarification}} {{needed is}} that the equivalence principle assumes a constant acceleration of 1g without considering the mechanics of generating 1g. If we do consider the mechanics of it, then we <b>must</b> <b>assume</b> the aforementioned windowless room has a fixed mass. Accelerating it at 1g means {{there is a constant}} force being applied, which = m*g where m is the mass of the windowless room along with its contents (including the observer). Now, if the observer jumps inside the room, an object lying freely on the floor will decrease in weight momentarily because the acceleration is going to decrease momentarily due to the observer pushing back against the floor in order to jump. The object will then gain weight while the observer is in the air and the resulting decreased mass of the windowless room allows greater acceleration; it will lose weight again when the observer lands and pushes once more against the floor; and it will finally return to its initial weight afterwards. To make all these effects equal those we would measure on a planet producing 1g, the windowless room must be assumed to have the same mass as that planet. Additionally, the windowless room must not cause its own gravity, otherwise the scenario changes even further. These are technicalities, clearly, but practical ones if we wish the experiment to demonstrate more or less precisely the equivalence of 1g gravity and 1g acceleration.|$|E

25|$|Sigismund {{confirmed}} the contracts of lease {{made with the}} Mennonites and on 20 October 1623, accorded special privileges to the lace-makers originating from Scotland, {{most of whom were}} Mennonites. But he refused to grant them any new rights or liberties. Upon the complaint of the city council of Elbing (Elbląg) that the Mennonites broke up marriages without having previously informed the authorities, married one another, and divided property at their pleasure, he forbade the Mennonites, upon penalty of a fine of 100 guilders, to marry without the foreknowledge of the authorities, and ordered that the Mennonites should be given no special rights. When the Mennonites nevertheless requested release from all civil handicaps, especially from military defense {{of the city and the}} court oath, he decreed on 26 April 1615, that they should do their duty like others. But the ruling was not enforced. On 26 April 1626, the king sent the following orders to the magistrate of Elbing, because he had heard that they had accepted Anabaptists and Mennonites and given them liberties, so that they, without swearing to him and the city, carried on trade and crafts, bought properties and food from the citizens, and tolerated them free of all that citizens <b>must</b> <b>assume,</b> and, what was not the least, their testimony at court was counted as valid as an oath, all of which is contrary to the public and special laws and offended his royal regard sorely and threatened to do harm, therefore these people were held to sworn obligations to the king and the city, to take up all civil burdens. Sigismund placed wild hordes of Poles and German mercenaries at the disposal of his brother-in-law, Ferdinand II of Austria, which burned and sacked the Hutterite villages at Schädowitz, Watznobis, and Goding, killing thousands.|$|E
500|$|Charitable trusts can't be used {{to promote}} {{political}} changes, and charities attempting such have been [...] "consistently rebuffed" [...] by the courts. There are two justifications for this. The first is that, even when a campaign for political change is stated {{to be for the}} benefit of the community, it is not within the court's competence to decide whether or not the change would be beneficial. The second, laid out in National Anti-Vivisection Society v IRC, is that the courts <b>must</b> <b>assume</b> the law to be correct, and as such could not support any charity which is trying to alter that law. Academic Alastair Hudson describes this argument as [...] "a little thin. Given that judges contentedly take it upon themselves to interpret, limit and extend statutes (as well as occasionally recommending the creation of new statutes to shore up the common law), it is peculiar to see judges so coy in the face of an argument being advanced that legislation might be changed".|$|E
500|$|Miller is {{considered}} one of the founders of psycholinguistics, which links language and cognition in psychology, to analyze how people use and create language. His 1951 book Language and Communication {{is considered}} seminal in the field. His later book, The Science of Words (1991) also focused on language psychology. He published papers along with Noam Chomsky on the mathematics and computational aspects of language and its syntax, two new areas of study. Miller also researched how people understood words and sentences, the same problem faced by artificial speech-recognition technology. [...] The book Plans and the Structure of Behavior (1960), written with Eugene Galanter and Karl H. Pribram, explored how humans plan and act, trying to extrapolate this to how a robot could be programmed to plan and do things. Miller is also known for coining Miller's Law: [...] "In order to understand what another person is saying, you <b>must</b> <b>assume</b> it is true and try to imagine what it could be true of".|$|E
