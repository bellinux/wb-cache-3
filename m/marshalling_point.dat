The fort was not a major structure and its status as a fort is questionable given that it consists mainly of earth ramparts. It did however play a strategic important role against the Kandyan kingdom, as the main <b>marshalling</b> <b>point</b> for Portuguese forces in their ongoing fight against the Kingdom of Kandy. It was recorded that approximately 400 Portuguese soldiers were garrisoned in the area. In the 1630s the fort fell to Kandyan forces, as the result of ongoining rebellion against the Portuguese invasion of the Kingdom of Kandy. The Portuguese however re-captured it. Following the defeat of the Portuguese in 1658, the area was re-occupied by the forces of the Kingdom of Kandy. The Menikkadawara fort lost its strategic role, once the Dutch secured control of Ceylon.|$|E

50|$|Although European explorers {{had passed}} through the Diamantina {{district}} in the 1840s and early 1860s, this semi-arid region was not occupied until the mid-1870s when a number of pastoral runs were established. In the early 1880s the towns of Birdsville and Bedourie developed to service the newly taken-up pastoral holdings of the Diamantina. Birdsville, known originally as the Diamantina Crossing, is reputed to have sprung up around a rough depot constructed by general merchant Matthew Flynn in the late 1870s on the stock route from Boulia south to Adelaide. It became the headquarters of Diamantina Shire when the shire was established in 1883. The township was officially surveyed by mid-1885 and the name Birdsville adopted {{in reference to the}} profuse bird life of the district. Located over 1,000 miles west of Brisbane and seven miles north of the Queensland-South Australian border, Birdsville developed as an administrative centre for police and border customs. Nearly all the trade of the town was with Adelaide, and it became an important <b>marshalling</b> <b>point</b> for cattle being driven south to markets in South Australia. Due to the lack of local timber, the town's remoteness and the lack of good access by roads or rail, which created prohibitively high transportation costs, almost all the town's early buildings were built of local sandstone.

It is over 1,000 {{miles west of}} Brisbane and 7 {{miles north of the}} state border with South Australia and was one of 14 border posts established before Federation to maintain tariff walls between the colonies. Birdsville was on a major stock route down the Diamantina via Boulia and Bedourie to southern markets, and it became an important <b>marshalling</b> <b>point</b> for cattle being driven south to South Australia. Most of the town's trade was with Adelaide, and by 1889 the population of Birdsville was 110, and the town had 2 general stores, 3 hotels, a police station, school, 2 blacksmith shops, 2 bakers, a cordial manufacturer, bootmaker, saddler, auctioneer & commission agent, and a number of residences.

By late 1889 this had been transferred to J Wookey, at the same price, but was in the event completed by Walton by the end of 1890. It was built on the police reserve and was part of a complex including a police station, lockup, tracker's quarters, and horse yards, although camels had also been used for police work in Birdsville since 1886.|$|E
50|$|Freight {{played a}} {{secondary}} role to passenger traffic {{for the majority}} of the Waverley Route's history. Located too far from the heavy industries of Central Scotland and the traffic in raw materials which they generated, it had to be content with a modest traffic in coal, wool and livestock. Goods traffic took on a new importance during the Second World War when the Waverley played a key role in moving personnel and supplies to the naval and military bases in Scotland. The amount of freight carried continued to rise after the war as passenger traffic tailed off with the route's downgrading, leaving ample capacity for the line to become a freight artery. This new role was aided by the construction of industrial plants closer to the route and the allocation to the line of the larger class of 2-10-0 locomotives, as well as the decisions taken by the Scottish Region of British Railways, firstly, to move fitted and semi-fitted freights from Carlisle for Aberdeen, Dundee and Perth over the Waverley Route, and secondly, to replace the old Niddrie and Portobello yards with a giant new marshalling yard alongside the line at Millerhill. The yard was in full operation by April 1963 and by November was handling an average of 21,000 wagons per week. However, although the yard flourished during its early years, changes in the national rail freight scene and the decline in the traditional Scottish industries resulted in it falling largely empty by the mid-1960s. A severe blow was dealt to Millerhill with the closure of the Waverley Route and by 1986 it was a mere a secondary <b>marshalling</b> <b>point.</b> The Down yard closed in 1983 and all the tracks were lifted except for two siding lines into Monktonhall Colliery; the colliery closed in 1989 before reopening briefly between 1993 and 1997 when final closure occurred and the lines were lifted.|$|E
