5|$|On April 22, 1992, {{less than}} a year after her kidnapping, a man called the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department from a gas station less than two miles from the Garridos' home. The caller {{reported}} that he saw Dugard in the gas station staring intently at a <b>missing</b> <b>child</b> poster of herself. The caller then reported seeing her leave in a large yellow van, possibly a Dodge. In 2009, after Dugard's release, an old yellow Dodge van was recovered from the Garrido property that matched the description of the van given in the call. The license plate was not reported in the 1992 call; the caller, the girl, and the van were gone by the time police arrived. The caller never identified himself, and the police did not pursue the matter any further. In contradiction to this story, Dugard reported that she never left the Garrido property from the day she was kidnapped until shortly before her first child was born in August 1994.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Sam Amirante, one of Gacy's two defense {{attorneys}} at his 1980 trial, authored procedures that were incorporated by the Illinois General Assembly into the <b>Missing</b> <b>Child</b> Recovery Act of 1984. Amirante has since {{stated that the}} primary inspiration for this legislation {{was the fact that}} at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a <b>missing</b> <b>child.</b> The Illinois <b>Missing</b> <b>Child</b> Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency—commonly known today as an Amber Alert.|$|E

25|$|The Code Adam Alert {{requires}} that the designated authority for a public building establish procedures for a child missing in a federal facility.

The General Services Administration administers the program in both owned and leased federal facilities.

25|$|On June 16, 1994, a 14-year-old {{boy from}} Bronx, New York fatally {{drowned in the}} wave pool. His body was found {{overnight}} by a construction worker after the park's closing, and he was later pronounced dead. The incident occurred during a school field trip; investigations placed the blame on six adults from Intermediate School 166 in the Bronx, who {{were in charge of}} the field trip and had failed to verify who was able to swim before releasing the pupils into the water park. In addition, when Maracallo was reported as missing, an assistant principal failed to act accordingly. Blame was also placed on the Dorney Park staff and lifeguards for making little effort to find the <b>missing</b> <b>child.</b> In 2002, Maracallo's mother was awarded $10 million from Dorney Park and the New York City Department of Education after both were concluded negligent by a Bronx Supreme Court jury.|$|E
500|$|Romantic {{notions of}} the 1920s as a more {{innocent}} period are put aside in favor of depicting Los Angeles as ruled by a despotic political infrastructure, steeped in sadistic, systematic corruption throughout the city government, police force and medical establishment. In {{addition to being a}} Kafkaesque drama about the search for a <b>missing</b> <b>child,</b> the film also focuses on issues relevant to the modern era. Eastwood noted a correlation between the corruption of 1920s Los Angeles and that of the modern era, manifesting in the egos of a police force that thinks it cannot be wrong {{and the way in which}} powerful organizations justify the use of corruption. [...] " [...] Los Angeles police department every so often seems to go into a period of corruption," [...] he said, [...] "It's happened even in recent years... so it was nice to comment [...] by going back to real events in 1928." [...] Eastwood said that Los Angeles had always been seen as [...] "glamorous", but he believed there had never been a [...] "golden age" [...] in the city. In Changeling, this dissonance manifests in the actions of Arthur Hutchins, who travels to the city in the hope of meeting his favorite actor. Eastwood said that given the corruption that the story covers, Hutchins' naïvete seemed [...] "bizarre". As a lesson in democratic activism, the film shows what it takes to provoke people to speak against unchecked authority, no matter the consequences. Richard Brody of The New Yorker said this rang as true for 1928 Los Angeles as it did for Poland in 1980 or Pakistan in 2008. The film directly quotes Chief of police James E. Davis: [...] "We will hold trial on gunmen in the streets of Los Angeles. I want them brought in dead, not alive, and I will reprimand any officer who shows the least bit of mercy to a criminal." [...] It compares police excess to the vigilantism of the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s, as the department's [...] "Gun Squad" [...] carries out illegal executions of criminals—"not to stamp out crime... but 'competition. The pressure from the police hierarchy was a motivator for officers to quickly solve Walter Collins' disappearance, and a potential reason why they ignored the fact they had returned the wrong child.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the end of}} the trial, various {{movements}} have arisen {{for the creation of a}} new law, called [...] "Caylee's Law", that would impose stricter requirements on parents to notify law enforcement of the death or disappearance of a child. One such petition, circulated via Change.org, has gained nearly 1.3 million electronic signatures. In response to this and other petitions, lawmakers in four states—Florida, Oklahoma, New York, and West Virginia—have begun drafting versions of [...] "Caylee's Law". The law in Oklahoma would require a child's parent or guardian to notify police of a <b>missing</b> <b>child</b> within 24 hours, and would also stipulate a time frame for notification of the disappearance of a young child under the age of12. The Florida law would make it a felony if a parent or legal guardian fails to report a <b>missing</b> <b>child</b> in timely manner if they could have known the child would be in danger. The call for mandatory reporting laws has been criticized as being [...] "reactive, overly indiscriminating and even counterproductive". One critic noted the law could lead to overcompliance and false reports by parents wary of becoming suspects, wasting police resources and leading to legitimate abductions going uninvestigated during the critical first few hours. Additionally innocent people could get snared in the law for searching for a child instead of immediately calling police.|$|E

Blethyn, who had initially felt sceptical and reticent about the film due to its background, was originally not available for filming but Bouchareb decided to delay filming to work with her. Upon release, the film received favourable reviews, particularly for its [...] "dynamite acting".

[...] Though the story may be told by some tellers in a negative light, it may also have a positive spin in that the teens become unwitting heroes in finding a <b>missing</b> <b>child</b> whose parents (as well as the police) had been unable to find. [...] According to Snopes.com, the legend had first surfaced in 2004, and as of 2007 the legend's truth status remains undetermined and unverifiable.
