5|$|Although the Xbox {{version of}} Halo lacks {{official}} support for online multiplayer play, third-party packet tunneling software provide unofficial ways around this limitation. The Windows and Macintosh ports of Halo support online matches involving up to 16 players and include multiplayer maps {{not in the}} original Xbox release. However, co-operative play {{was removed from the}} ports because it would have required large amounts of recoding to implement. In April 2014, it was announced that GameSpy's servers and <b>matchmaking,</b> on which Halo PC relied, would be shut down by May 31 of the same year. A team of fans and Bungie employees announced they would produce a patch for the game to keep its multiplayer servers online. The patch was released on May 16, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Aside from map packs, {{the game}} is {{supported}} by regular <b>matchmaking</b> playlist updates. These updates make playlist and balance changes, sandbox tweaks and fix minor glitches. A title update to fix various game issues and glitches was released in December 2012.

IndieGames.com reported mixed reviews from players.|$|E
5|$|More than 2.7million players {{participated in}} the beta, which lasted from May 3 to 20. The game was rolled out from an {{internal}} group of Bungie and Microsoft employees, with {{the total number of}} players in the thousands. When the beta went public, more than a million played the first day, causing back-end servers to struggle to handle the traffic. While the engineering team had overestimated server load, bugs in server clusters caused game uploads to become backed up, slowing <b>matchmaking</b> until the underlying issues could be fixed. Jarrard noted that the 16million total hours of play time and large-scale rollout of the beta was vital to seeing how Reach would perform.|$|E
5|$|The game {{supports}} {{up to six}} {{human or}} artificial intelligence players in local and online multiplayer, except on the PlayStation 4, which has a human player limit of four per console. Videoball has team and ranked <b>matchmaking</b> multiplayer modes. There is no set practice game mode, but players can train against computer-controlled opponents in exhibition matches and the scenario-based Arcade mode, in which the player faces two computer-controlled opponents in specific level configurations. The Arcade mode artificial intelligence personalities each have fitting names, such as Homer (who stays near its endzone) and Punchy (who bullies players with projectiles). Some work in pairs to establish gameplay concepts, such as Tippy, who passes the ball to Toppy, who maintains {{the top of the}} field.|$|E
5|$|Valve offers Steamworks, an {{application}} programming interface (API) that provides development and publishing tools {{to take advantage of}} Steam client's features, free-of-charge to game and software developers. Steamworks provides networking and player authentication tools for both server and peer-to-peer multiplayer games, <b>matchmaking</b> services, support for Steam community friends and groups, Steam statistics and achievements, integrated voice communications, and Steam Cloud support, allowing games to integrate with the Steam client. The API also provides anti-cheating devices and digital copy management. Developers of software available on Steam are able to track sales of their titles through the Steam store. In February 2014, Valve announced that it would begin to allow developers to set up their own sales for their games independent of any sales that Valve may set.|$|E
5|$|Descent 3 was {{presented}} at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 1998, where developers showed off a demonstration of the game. In the months leading to the game's release, the game's publisher, Interplay Productions, ran a program that allowed Descent fans to submit a digital photo of themselves along with a pilot name to the company. These photos would later be included in the game so that players could use them as their multiplayer profiles. Outrage also released two game demos that allowed customers to try the game before purchasing it. The second demo included a single-player level and several multiplayer matches which could be played through a <b>matchmaking</b> service provided by Outrage. From March to August 1999, Interplay also held a Descent 3 tournament in the United States consisting of three phases where numerous players could compete against each other in multiplayer matches. The winner was awarded a prize of US$50,000.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Siege {{has both}} a single-player and {{multiplayer}} mode. The single-player mode {{consists of a}} single story and world; players can either create a new character when starting the story or use one created in a prior playthrough. The cooperative multiplayer mode allows for up to eight players to play through either the single-player storyline or in the multiplayer map, which features a central town hub with increasingly difficult enemies as players move away from it. Multiplayer games can be set to different difficulty levels, allowing accommodation of higher-leveled characters. Additional maps can be created by players that can allow for competitive multiplayer instead. Multiplayer matches can be created and joined via local area networks, direct IP addresses, and, prior to its closure in 2006, through the Microsoft Zone <b>matchmaking</b> service.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can either}} choose {{to play a}} ranked Deathmatch or DarkOps, {{where they will be}} matched with other players using a system called TrueSkill <b>Matchmaking,</b> or they may choose a player match where they can choose their game from a list of player hosted games. Like the {{original}} Perfect Dark, these games can be highly customized and can also include computer game bots. Features such as their difficulty and behavior can be changed to match player preference. For example, the Judge bot always attacks leading players with the highest kills score. Players can also issue commands to them {{as long as they are}} on their respective team, such as follow or hold position, and set waypoints for them to walk to. The game includes by default six different maps and each has two variants; the only change is the placement of the bases. Most of the maps are large ones, ideal for 32 players at once, with small variants for 4-16 player games.|$|E
5|$|Rogers has livestreamed prerelease {{sessions}} of Videoball via Twitch. He broadcast gameplay from Twitch's booth at PAX East 2014 with indie publisher Midnight City. In February 2014, PC Gamer Wes Fenlon {{reported that the}} game still had work left in its artwork, soundtrack, new arenas, and online multiplayer mode. Videoball was selected for the July 2014 Evolution Championship Series fighting game tournament's Indie Showcase.

Rogers has said that ranked <b>matchmaking</b> was highly requested by fans. Videoball was planned for release in 2014, and ultimately launched on July 12, 2016, on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows, with Iron Galaxy as its publisher. OS X and Linux releases are planned.|$|E
5|$|Steam is {{a digital}} {{distribution}} platform developed by Valve Corporation, which offers {{digital rights management}} (DRM), multiplayer gaming, video streaming and social networking services. Steam provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games, and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud saving, and in-game voice and chat functionality. The software provides a freely available application programming interface (API) called Steamworks, which developers can use to integrate many of Steam's functions into their products, including networking, <b>matchmaking,</b> in-game achievements, micro-transactions, and support for user-created content through Steam Workshop. Though initially developed for use on Microsoft Windows operating systems, versions for OS X and Linux were later released. Mobile apps with connected functionality with the main software were later released for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone devices in the 2010s.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} occupations could be chosen or {{inherited}} from a father's line of work. This would include – {{but was not}} limited to – coffinmakers, ironworkers and blacksmiths, tailors, cooks and noodle-makers, retail merchants, tavern, teahouse, or winehouse managers, shoemakers, seal cutters, pawnshop owners, brothel heads, and merchant bankers engaging in a proto-banking system involving notes of exchange. Virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had. Male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status, regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms. Public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods. Urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices, specialized luxury goods, headgear, fine cloth, teas, and others. Smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers. A small township also provided a place for simple schooling, news and gossip, <b>matchmaking,</b> religious festivals, traveling theater groups, tax collection, and bases of famine relief distribution.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, Valve {{created a}} formal process to allow purchasers to request full refunds on games they had {{purchased}} on Steam for any reason, with refunds guaranteed {{within the first}} two weeks as long as the player had not spent more than two hours in the game. Prior to June 2015, Valve had a no-refunds policy, but allowed them in certain circumstances, such as if third-party content had failed to work or improperly reports on certain features. For example, the Steam version of From Dust was originally stated to have a single, post-installation online DRM check with its publisher Ubisoft, but the released version of the game required a DRM check with Ubisoft's servers each time it was used. At the request of Ubisoft, Valve offered refunds to customers who bought the game while Ubisoft worked to release a patch that would remove the DRM check altogether. On The War Zs release, players found that the game was still in an alpha-build state and lacked many of the features advertised on its Steam store page. Though the developers Hammerpoint Interactive altered the description after launch to reflect {{the current state of the}} game software, Valve removed the title from Steam and offered refunds to those who had bought it. Valve also removed Earth: Year 2066 from the Early Access program and offered refunds after discovering that the game's developers had reused assets from other games and used developer tools to erase negative complaints about the title. Valve stated it would continue to work on improving the discovery process for users, taking principles they learned in providing transparency for <b>matchmaking</b> in Dota 2 to make the process better, and using that towards Steam storefront procedures to help refine their algorithms with user feedback.|$|E

25|$|In Season 3, Blizzard used a skill ranking {{calculation}} at {{the onset}} of the season that decreased the player's Season 2 skill ranking to better sort players into the initial tiers, keep relative player skill in each tier consistent at the start of the season, and prevent rapid drops of a player's skill at the season's onset; they had found that their algorithms placed too many players in the Gold and Platinum tiers at the start of Season 2, creating imbalanced <b>matchmaking</b> and rapid declines of player rankings, and anticipate that this chance will better spread out players over tiers and improve <b>matchmaking.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since the 1990s, {{professional}} teams or organized clans {{have set}} up matches via Internet Relay Chat networks such as QuakeNet. As eSports have developed, it has also become common for players to use automated <b>matchmaking</b> clients built into the games themselves. This was popularized by the 1996 release of Blizzard's Battle.net, which has been integrated into both the Warcraft and StarCraft series. Automated <b>matchmaking</b> has become commonplace in console gaming as well, with services such as Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network. After competitors have contacted each other, the game is often managed by a game server, either remotely {{to each of the}} competitors, or running on one of the competitor's machines.|$|E
25|$|Casual <b>matchmaking</b> allows players, alone, or in a {{party with}} invited friends, to be {{randomly}} matched against others. The game servers will attempt to match the gathered players in party via a dynamic queue with others based on general skill level, only broadening outside this search range if {{it takes a long}} time to find matching players. Blizzard works to adjust this <b>matchmaking</b> approach to making sure players will find matches of people with roughly equivalent skill level. For example, in June 2016, Blizzard removed the option for players to avoid specific opponents; the option was meant for players to be able ignore trolls, but instead found that highly skilled players were being put on these avoidance lists and were having difficulty finding games or would be matched with new and less-skilled players.|$|E
25|$|With {{the closure}} of the Games for Windows – Live Marketplace, the PC version of BioShock 2 was patched in October 2013 to remove Games for Windows Live in favor of Steamworks support for <b>matchmaking.</b> In addition, Minerva's Den was {{released}} for free for players who owned BioShock 2 before the patch.|$|E
