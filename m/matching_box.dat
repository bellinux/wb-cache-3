50|$|These oroshigane differ {{significantly}} from Western-style graters, as they produce a much finer grating. Traditionally, these graters were tin-coated copper plates with many small spikes gouged out of the metal, but no actual perforations through the metal. These graters are still considered the best and are used by professional chefs. For preparing wasabi and yamaimo, graters with the surface made from shark skin were exclusively used. These have an even finer grating surface than a metal one; much closer to a sanding paper. However, nowadays non-professional cooks usually use much less expensive graters made from other metals, plastic, or ceramics. A modern variation of these graters also has perforations and may come with a <b>matching</b> <b>box</b> so that the grated material drops through the grater into the box.|$|E

It is well known that the plasma properties and the beam creation are modified by the microwave frequency and power. In this report we investigated how the ions beam generation in an ECR ion source is affected by the electromagnetic field excited inside the plasma chamber. For this purpose simulations and related experiments have been performed with the CAPRICE ECRIS [1]. The injection flange of the ion source consists of a copper <b>matching</b> <b>box</b> where the WR 62 waveguide line connects the Klystron generator and the source. The electromagnetic wave is transmitted into the plasma chamber through a coaxial line. In order to realize an impedance matching inside the copper box...|$|E

The idea is to precompute a rule 2 ̆ 7 s binding space, and then have each binding independently monitor working memory for the incremental formation of tuple instantiations. A key feature of <b>Match</b> <b>Box</b> is that on a massively parallel architecture, it can perform a rule 2 ̆ 7 s computationally intensive incremental joint testing in constant time. It also finds application on conventional serial processors. 2 ̆...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the outline of}} the “polygonal barrel-plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method” and its units in detail. This method is embodied as a new particle surface modification system consisting of 5 parts: 1) a gas-supply unit, 2) a vacuum chamber unit (including gas shower and barrel electrodes), 3) a radio frequency (RF) power supply unit (including <b>matching</b> <b>box),</b> 4) a vacuum pumps, and 5) a control unit. In this method, a hexagonal barrel containing particles is rotated or oscillated during plasma CVD, leading to the efficient and uniform surface modification of individual particles with various materials, especially carbon and metal oxides. In addition, the film thicknesses of the deposited materials can be controlled very easily by changing the RF power and treatment time. Thus, the polygonal barrel-plasma CVD method allows controllable surface modification of particles and is useful for research and development of functionalized particle...|$|E

Subject codes use another set of primitives to classify senses of words by subject (ECONOMICS, ENGINEERING, etc.). Guthrie et al. (1991) demonstrate a typical use of this information: in addition to using the Lesk-based method of counting overlaps between definitions and contexts, they impose a correspondence of subject codes in an iterative process. No quantitative evaluation of this method is available, but Cowie et al. (1992) improve the method using simulated annealing and report results of 47 % for sense distinctions and 72 % for homographs. The use of LDOCE box codes, however, is problematic: the codes are not systematic (see, for example, Fontenelle, 1990); in later work, Braden-Harder (1993) showed that simply <b>matching</b> <b>box</b> or subject codes is not sufficient for disambiguation.

40|$|In {{a number}} of recent adaptational studies {{evidence}} for a different processing of incremental and decremental cone signals has been reported. The present study examined whether such asymmetries occur in spatial pattern as well. Subjects set color matches between a uniform, 2 ° <b>matching</b> <b>box</b> and bars within squarewave patterns. The squarewaves varied in spatial frequency, color direction, and contrast. For all three cone signals the asymmetric matches showed clear evidence for increment–decrement asymmetries: Although both incremental and decremental matches scaled roughly linearly with pattern contrast, in general, the scalings for the two types of color signals differed. This difference in scaling increased with spatial frequency, thus leading to an increase {{in the size of the}} increment–decrement asymmetry with spatial frequency. The matches were well described by means of two-stage models, consisting of a color transformation in the first stage and a pattern-dependent scaling in the second stage. Analyses based on these pattern–color separable models suggest that the asymmetries are mediated mainly through a white–black mechanism and much less, if at all, through a red–green and yellow–blue mechanism...|$|E
40|$|A {{high density}} ‘blue ’ mode has been {{observed}} when operating the Helicon Double Layer Thruster (HDLT) with xenon. Using a Langmuir probe and a retarding field energy analyser (RFEA), the plasma source and exhaust have been characterized at various radio frequency (RF) powers and operating pressures. When operating at low RF powers, the HDLT prototype is shown {{to be in a}} capacitively coupled mode. As the RF power is increased, a discrete mode transition occurs over a small RF power range (at about 625 W at 0. 45 mTorr) and the plasma inside the source increases in density significantly and changes to a bright white/blue colour. This high density mode exhibits hysteresis, and radial measurements inside the source reveal a centrally peaked profile that is indicative of a helicon wave-sustained discharge. The quality, or Q, factor of the <b>matching</b> <b>box</b> is determined as a function of RF power and is shown to decrease in the high density mode, consistent with the increase in plasma density observed. The xenon exhaust of the HDLT prototype is investigated axially with the Langmuir probe and the RFEA and is shown to follow a Boltzmann expansion with an electron temperature of about 6 eV. 1...|$|E
