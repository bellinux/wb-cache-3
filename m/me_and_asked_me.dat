500|$|... "Badlaa" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{inspired}} by stories of Indian fakirs. In fact, the episode's title means [...] "to retort" [...] or [...] "to revenge" [...] in Urdu. Further inspiration came [...] "from {{a little bit of}} desperation" [...] according to Shiban. He later recalled that he was walking through the Vancouver airport and suddenly had the thought, [...] "What if someone who came up to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> for money was actually a bad guy." [...] Shiban later noted that his early drafts of the episode featured the antagonist with a different power. He explained, [...] "My original idea was a beggar with no legs who can actually shrink himself and climb inside your ear, and Chris Carter–and this is why he's Chris Carter–said 'No, no, no! I know what's even better.'" [...] Shiban later said that [...] "... one thing about this episode that I'm sort of proud is that people often have told me that it is the most disgusting thought that they ever had, that this little man would actually enter your body and travel around inside you." ...|$|E
2500|$|On that {{occasion}} {{the prospect of}} inviting Baba Hari Dass to the US was raised. [...] "They stayed with <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> {{to go to the}} United States. I said I could go anywhere. I was ready to move to the higher mountains".|$|E
2500|$|Charles Grean of Dot Records had {{arranged}} with {{the studio to}} do an album of space music based on music from Star Trek, {{and he has a}} teenage daughter who's a fan of the show and a fan of Mr. Spock. She said, 'Well, if you're going to do an album of music from Star Trek, then Mr. Spock should be on the album.' So Dot contacted <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> if I would be interested in either speaking or singing on the record. I said I was very interested in doing both. ...That was the first album we did, which was called Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space. It was very well received and successful enough that Dot then approached <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to sign a long-term contract.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Leonard," [...] she begged, [...] "please don't {{do or say}} {{anything}} foolish. Since we do meet again, though, like this, I am {{going to ask you}} one question. What made you come to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to marry you that day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... --And {{the wife}} with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up before <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> {{to make an}} order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.|$|R
5000|$|... "I shall {{dress in}} my finest clothes and {{walk up and}} down the Palace Bridge. Surely a rich man will fall in love with <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to be his wife. But I will say, 'No! I can never be yours! Not unless you first give me all your buttons!'" ...|$|R
2500|$|The limited series Agents of Atlas #1-6 (Oct. 2006 - March 2007) {{was set in}} {{the present}} day and {{likewise}} set in mainstream continuity. The series emerged from what writer Parker called [...] "a huge editorial hunch" [...] at Marvel, and said {{the revival of the}} characters [...] "is something that [...] Mark Paniccia was looking at and [...] thought specifically of <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> what I would do with it". Paniccia says the idea came to him when he picked up a copy of the What if? story and found the cover [...] "intriguing; it instantly tickles the nostalgia bone".|$|E
2500|$|Stephenson {{was very}} much one of the {{professionals}} and even as captain had little time for the stuffier county cricket element. There were run-ins with the county establishment. Cricket writer David Foot in an obituary of Stephenson reported [...] "one corrosive exchange with the county chairman, Bunty Longrigg". Foot reports Stephenson as saying: [...] "It was my fifth year in charge and we'd got to the Bath Festival. The chairman approached <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> bluntly who I thought we should leave out {{to make way for}} an amateur or two. I bristled and told him that if he had plans to make changes, he had better skipper the county himself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Wales {{described}} himself {{simply as the}} founder of Wikipedia; however, according to Brian Bergstein of the Associated Press, [...] "Sanger has long been cited as a co-founder." [...] There is evidence that Sanger was called co-founder, along with Wales, as early as 2001, and he {{is referred to as}} such in early Wikipedia press releases and Wikipedia articles and in a September 2001 New York Times article for which both were interviewed. In 2006, Wales said, [...] "He used to work for me [...] I don't agree with calling him a co-founder, but he likes the title"; nonetheless, before January 2004, Wales did not dispute Sanger's status as co-founder and, indeed, identified himself as [...] "co-founder" [...] as late as August 2002. In Sanger's introductory message to the Nupedia mailing list, he said that [...] "Jimmy Wales contacted <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to apply as editor-in-chief of Nupedia. Apparently, Bomis, Inc. (which owns Nupedia)... who could manage this sort of long-term project, he thought I would be perfect for the job. This is indeed my dream job". Sanger said [...] "He [...] had had the idea for Nupedia since at least last fall".|$|E
60|$|I believe that, if he {{had stood}} in silence for another minute, my brain would have given way. But those sharp {{military}} accents were exactly what I needed to bring me to myself. Living or dead, here was the Emperor standing before <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> questions. I sprang to the salute.|$|R
60|$|I am not sure, but I {{think he}} was some distant {{connection}} of ours; at all events, I know he was a kind friend. I, seated in the velvet chair of state, he would unroll his case of instruments before <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to choose, recommending with affectionate eulogisms the most murderous looking.|$|R
5000|$|In my case, {{the creators}} talk to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to do a soundtrack {{a year or}} two before the {{animation}} is finished. At that time, I think of the plot in my brain, when the characters' names—everything about the characters—has not been decided yet. This is even when the title has not be decided yet.|$|R
60|$|A {{little later}} B----- met <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to dine {{with him on}} Monday.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can give}} you even better proof than that. This morning Mortimer came to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to give him secret lessons in golf." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot tell," [...] was the girl's answer; [...] "it {{would have}} been {{different}} from the beginning. He courted <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to be his wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it {{my fault}} {{that he should}} be constant? I told him when he offered to me that if Walter were to come back to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> again, I should go to him in spite of any promise that I had made. I said so as plain as I am saying this to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|One good thing, if no more, these {{memories}} may accomplish. Young men, especially in America, write to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to recommend [...] "{{a course of}} reading." [...] Distrust a course of reading! People who really care for books read all of them. There is no other course. Let this be a reply. No other answer shall they get from me, the inquiring young men.|$|R
5000|$|They put cotton on both eyes, then taped {{them and}} {{tightened}} a hood around my neck. They tied my hands <b>and</b> legs, submerged <b>me</b> in a 250-liter tank that had ammonia, urine, excrement, and seawater. They submerged me until I could not breathe anymore. They repeated {{it over and}} over, while beating <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> questions. That is {{what they called the}} submarine." ...|$|R
60|$|And then, a {{month after}} she had died, Hugh Blair came to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to be his wife. He said he had always loved me, and could never love any other woman.|$|E
60|$|He {{shook his}} 'ead and smiled agin, and, arter opening the wicket a trifle {{and telling the}} cabman he shouldn't be long, he turned to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> for the sixpence, to wear on his watch-chain.|$|E
6000|$|When {{she paused}} by <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> lightly of what I was dreaming, since I {{had such a}} sober face, I {{answered}} her truly that it was of her--whereat she laughed, as one not ill pleased, and said half mockingly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{the fellow}} is mad, too. He {{tried to be}} sociable for a bit, and could find nothing else but to make big eyes at <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> if I {{believed}} 'in communication beyond the grave.' Communication beyond--I didn't know what he meant at first. I didn't know what to say. 'A very solemn subject, Mr. Bunter,' says he. I've given {{a great deal of}} study to it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} {{characters}} of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, the phrase [...] "Dammit, Janet!" [...] has entered the pop culture lexicon. The phrase has become so ingrained in society that thirty years after first singing the song for the film, American actor Barry Bostwick told an interviewer [...] "For as long as I live, people will be coming up to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> to say, [...] "Dammit, Janet. I love you." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{five o'clock}} I {{got up to}} go back to the wharf, and, taking no notice of 'er, I walked into the street and jumped on a 'bus that was passing. She jumped too, and, arter the {{conductor}} had 'elped 'er up off of 'er knees and taken her arms away from his waist, I'm blest if he didn't turn on <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> why I 'adn't left her at 'ome.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, the Bishop {{sent for}} <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> {{to see your}} father. It was partly from slips in {{critical}} knowledge, which betrayed the want of study, and the general want of thought and progress, {{and all the rest}} of it, in his papers--" ...|$|E
60|$|We strolled round, {{before we}} came out. Just by the {{entrance}} to the choir an official stopped <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> if I wanted to go and see a lot of fal-lal things he had got on show--relics and bones, and old masters, and such-like Wardour-street rubbish.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{have not}} come for that, Major; I have brought a {{dispatch}} that arrived at two o'clock this morning. Doolan opened it and came to <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to bring it on to you, as I knew the way and where your camp was to be pitched." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Dunham, miserably; [...] "he got <b>me</b> aside, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> for it. What could I do? What {{would you}} have done yourself?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "People {{are calling}} <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> {{not to make}} any {{announcement}} to leave but now is the time, A time comes in every player's life {{when he has to}} decide and I always tried my best to serve my county with my head high. No player always remains fit, the motivation never remains the same, so this is the time when Younis should leave the field after the upcoming series in West Indies." [...] —Younis Khan.|$|R
5000|$|Called Bamm Bamm and TKO, Patrick Willis and Takeo Spikes {{were called}} the dynamic duo. Spikes said, [...] "With Patrick I’ve always admired how great {{he wants to}} be at a young age. That’s how he gained my respect. He would always just hound <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> questions. He was the sponge and I was the bucket of water...that’s why our {{relationship}} is bigger than just on the field. He’s like a brother to me." ...|$|R
60|$|Without {{looking at}} her cousin, she then {{addressed}} <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> about Agnes, and whether she should see her, and whether she was not likely to come that day; and was so much disturbed, that I wondered how even the Doctor, buttering his toast, could be blind to what was so obvious.|$|E
6000|$|Gunner W. H. Blackburn, 28th Battery Royal Field Artillery, being duly sworn, states: 'I saw a Boer take a {{rifle and}} bandolier from a wounded Derby man, and then shoot him; the Boer then came to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> for my rifle; I showed it him {{where it was}} lying on the ground.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, till I hurt myself. Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy to <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to {{come and}} spend a week with her when Sallie does. She is going in the spring when the opera comes, {{and it will be}} {{perfectly}} splendid, if Mother only lets me go," [...] answered Meg, cheering up at the thought.|$|E
5000|$|The {{popularity}} of the song later motivated Debbie D. to leave the group Avenue D; she commented in a 2009 interview with The Miami Herald, [...] "I was ready to do something new. I was tired of everybody coming up to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asking</b> <b>me,</b> 'Do I look like a slut?' Irony only goes so far. We turned into the characters in our songs. We wrote them when we were 21. By 28 I had just outgrown it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was working}} at my machine," [...] said the witness, [...] "when Pete Krovac comes to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> to hide behind a big drill-press and watch what the {{assistant}} general manager done when he comes through the shop again. So I hides there and I saw this man Bince come along and drop an envelope beside Krovac's machine, and after he left I comes out as Krovac picks it up, and I seen him take some money out of it." ...|$|R
60|$|After a {{distressing}} {{interval of}} silence, {{during which they}} all continued regarding me with unabated curiosity, the old gentleman condescended to address <b>me</b> again <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> my name <b>and</b> country.|$|R
