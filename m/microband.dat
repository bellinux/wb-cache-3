40|$|In this thesis, the {{deformation}} {{structures that}} form in 10 - 30 % channel-die plane strain compressed Goss&# 61485;oriented Ni single crystals and 50 - 75 % cold-rolled polycrystalline interstitial free (IF) steel {{were characterized by}} two and three dimensional electron backscatter diffraction (2 D- and 3 D-EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Emphasis was given to understand the evolution sequence of microbands via a detailed characterization of dislocation structures and crystallographic aspects of their boundaries. In the IF steel, both <b>microband</b> structures and the deformation morphology near grain boundaries were studied. 	Microbands are well-known deformation features that form in the deformation microstructures of many medium to high stacking fault energy metals and alloys. The crystallographic nature of <b>microband</b> boundaries was investigated in a 30 % deformed Ni crystal using the foregoing analysis techniques. When viewed in the three orthogonal sections, <b>microband</b> boundary traces were classically aligned in the normal direction (ND) &# 61485;rolling direction (RD) section at an acute angle from the RD, but appear wavy in the RD-transverse direction (TD) section. The latter observation {{may lead to the}} conclusion that <b>microband</b> boundaries are non-crystallographic. The use of 3 D-EBSD to reconstruct actual microbands in a volume of deformed material revealed significant new information about their morphology. Here, <b>microband</b> surfaces are largely planar over large distances, but frequently interrupted by local distortions and undulations due to interactions between intersecting, non-coplanar microbands. The overall investigation has revealed that <b>microband</b> boundaries are aligned close to active { 111 } slip planes (i. e. they are crystallographic) but the bumps and distortions they contain are non&# 61485;crystallographic {{in the sense that they}} deviate away from these slip planes. The non-crystallographic features of microbands (as revealed by their wavy structure in the RD-TD section) may be explained by the crystallographic oscillations of up to ± 7. 5 ° towards RD that occur during deformation. Such oscillations result in varying fractions of slip on a given { 111 } plane, thereby resulting in varying degrees of interaction between the two sets of non-coplanar microbands. These local and intense <b>microband</b> interactions result in the deviation away from their active slip planes. 	The dislocation structures associated with early <b>microband</b> evolution in a 10 % deformed Ni crystal was investigated by 2 D-EBSD and TEM. A discrepancy was found between EBSD and TEM measurements in the included angle between two intersecting dense dislocation walls (DDWs), i. e. the EBSD and TEM&# 61485;measured angles were 90 ° and 70 °, respectively. After 10 % strain, the spacing between DDWs are larger (average > 5 micron) than the spacing between <b>microband</b> boundaries (average ~ 1 micron) after 30 % strain. The dilocation structures between two DDWs comprise both mash and cell structures. In the former, it is possible to identify individual dislocations whereas, in the latter, dislocations obtain a denser distribution within ~ 150 nm thick boundaries and their interiors contain very few dislocations. The cells are initially equiaxed but eventually their boundaries orient along the existing DDWs. Subsequently, many such cell boundary segments constitute denser segments of dislocation walls, from which microbands form by splitting into two DDWs at ~ 1 micron spacing. Microbands also form in series on one set of DDWs parallel to a second set of DDWs. These boundaries then propagate into two walls to generate <b>microband</b> channels. Once a DDW forms it may propagate into dislocation&# 61485;free regions trailing behind a <b>microband</b> channel through splitting events. 	<b>Microband</b> boundaries are generally regarded as low-angle deformation features that accommodate a small crystallographic rotation in the range 1 - 4 degree. In this part of the thesis, EBSD/TEM revealed unusual orientation differences of up to 20 degree across <b>microband</b> boundaries in { 111 } &# 61485;oriented grains in a 50 % cold rolled IF steel. Despite their high angle nature, the <b>microband</b> interfaces maintain their well&# 61485;known crystallographic characteristics, that is, they are aligned closely with highly stressed slip planes. Rigid body rotations are argued to take place around the interface normal between adjacent <b>microband</b> lattices, thereby generating the unusual microstructure containing alternating <b>microband</b> boundaries that are oriented in equal and opposite relative angles and produce an array of orientation pairs in their spatial distributions. 	Grain boundaries play an important role in the formation of deformation and recrystallization textures in steels. In this second study using 3 D-EBSD, microtexture distributions across a complex boundary between ~{ 111 } &# 61485; and ~{ 111 } &# 61485;oriented grains in a 75 % cold rolled IF steel were studied. The coexistence of several deformation features both near to and on the boundaries, such as steep orientation gradients up to 5 degree/micron, high angle boundary networks and numerous thin, elongated blocks on their surface, reveal the complex, irregular and diffuse nature of grain boundaries and why they are excellent sites for nucleation of recrystallization...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the shear band formation in the high cold rolled body-centred cubic (BCC) metal is analyzed. Based on the plastic deformation theory, the shear distribution in the deformed grain is calculated by using the Taylor constraint model and the Bishop and Hill maximum work principle.

By inspection of the two sets of orientation neighbourhoods it is demonstrated that only cube <b>microbands</b> sorrounded by material with a φ° orientation relationship provide cube nuclei. Thus the cube texture arises from competition between nuclei in a variety of orientation environments, the successful nuclei having environments into which they initially grow characterised by a φ° relationship. The process is best described as micro-growth selection, in which the local texture determines the viability and competitive advantage of nuclei, while the global deformation texture (i. e. that determined by traditional diffraction methods) is that which is consumed by those nuclei, with the possibility of further growth selection as recrystallisation proceeds. © 1993. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The suitability of <b>microband</b> electrodes for use in electrochemical analysis was examined in experiments on two systems. The first system studied to validate the electrochemical responses of the annular <b>microband</b> electrode was decamethylferrocene (DmFc), as a stable internal reference probe commonly used in ionic liquids, in [Pmim][NTf 2], where the diffusion coefficients of DmFc and DmFc+ and the standard electron rate constant for the DmFc/DmFc+ couple were determined through fitting chronoamperometric and cyclic voltammetric responses with relevant simulations.

40|$|Microstructure {{development}} in an interstitial-free steel during cold rolling at low strain levels (ε ≤ 9. 8 %) {{has been investigated}} by using transmission electron microscopy. At a strain of 2. 2 %, { 112 } slip systems operate in addition to { 110 } slip planes. Dislocation reactions occur at this stage to produce immobile 100 segments in the scissors configuration and these segments are also found at higher strain in the dislocation walls of microbands. The formation of microbands starts at small reductions (ε ∼ 6. 7 %), and microbands are of lenticular shapes and have habit planes running approximately parallel to { 110 } planes. Two sets of dislocations comprise the <b>microband</b> walls; one is predominant and has its Burgers vector lying on the microband's habit plane. The secondary set is much less dense, and its slip plane is not coplanar with the <b>microband</b> habit plane. A considerable misorientation exists between the inner region of a <b>microband</b> and either of its two neighbouring matrices, rather than between the two matrices, {{which is consistent with}} Jackson's double cross-slip model. However, the growing end of a <b>microband</b> indicates the splitting of a dense dislocation sheet. In the specimen that was rolled to ε = 9. 8 %, some grains contain one or two sets of microbands, while some are microband-free. The crystallographic measurement and deformation geometry calculation reveal that the habit plane of an observed <b>microband</b> has the largest Schmid factor; and when one (111) slip direction is intensively activated in this plane, one set of microbands is formed on this plane. Two sets of microbands form if two (111) slip directions have high and nearly equal shear stresses. In the case of microband-free crystals, up to seven slip systems have similar Schmid factors and thus are activated concurrently. This leads to homogeneous deformation and as a result, no microbands form. Based on these results, a new mechanism is proposed for <b>microband</b> formation involving double cross-slip, dislocation wall splitting and dislocation exchange between the walls. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The expression is applicable when {{the length of}} the <b>microband</b> is much greater than the width, so that the diffusion of the electrochemical species can be regarded as two-dimensional. We extend the previously known result for the diffusion-limited current response (Aoki, K. et al. J. Electroanal. Chem. 1987, 225, 19 &# 8211; 32 and Phillips, C. G. J. Electroanal. Chem. 1992, 333, 11 &# 8211; 32) to accommodate quasi-reversible reactions and unequal diffusion coefficients of the oxidant and the reductant. Comparison with numerical calculations validates the analytical expression, and we demonstrate that unequal diffusion coefficients can substantially change the current response. Finally, we discuss the form of the long-time current response for a one-step, one-electron redox reaction if the rate constants are modelled in the Butler&# 8211;Volmer framework, and indicate the importance of choosing the width of the <b>microband</b> appropriately to allow accurate experimental determination of the standard kinetic rate constant and the electron transfer coefficient...|$|E
40|$|The voltammetric {{behaviour}} of selenium(IV) was {{studied at}} platinum and gold electrodes in sulphuric acid, perchloric acid and potassium chloride media {{as a basis}} for its voltammetric detection. The best voltammetric behaviour was recorded at gold electrodes with perchloric acid as the supporting electrolyte. The concomitant presence of metals, such as copper or lead, and of model biomolecules, such as bovine serum albumin, in the solution resulted in a deterioration of the electrochemical response for selenium(IV). Quantitative detection of selenium(IV) by square wave anodic stripping voltammetry at both a millimetre-sized gold disc electrode and a <b>microband</b> electrode array revealed linear responses to selenium concentration in the ranges of 5 - 15 μM and 0. 1 - 10 μM, respectively, with 60 s preconcentration. The sensitivities were 6. 4 μA μM- 1 cm- 2 and 100 μA μM- 1 cm- 2 at the disc and the <b>microband</b> array, respectively. The detection limit at the <b>microband</b> electrode array was 25 nM, illustrating the potentiality of such microelectrodes for the development of mercury-free analytical methods for the trace detection of selenium(IV) ...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Microstructural evolution during thermomechanical processing of several Al-Mg alloys was studied using backscattered orientation contrast imaging in the scanning electron microscope. The microstructural evolution in A 1 - 8 Mg- 0. 1 Zr was characterized in three phases: (a) {{in the initial}} stages, precipitation occurred on prior boundaries and <b>microbands</b> were observed in the grain interiors; (b) during intermediate stages, higher order <b>microbands</b> were observed and precipitates formed throughout the microstructure on both lower- and higher-order microbands; (c) in the final stages, equiaxed regions appeared around larger particles suggesting particle stimulated nucleation of recrystallization. A higher Mg-content alloy (A 1 - 10 Mg 0. 1 Zr) was compared at two stages and seen to provide a greater volume fraction of similar sized precipitate. A finer recrystallized microstructure and greater superplastic response was observed in the Al- 10 Mg- 0. 1 Zr alloy. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} study, the {{microstructure}} and texture {{characteristics of a}} model Ni- 30 Fe austenitic alloy were investigated during hot deformation and subsequent isothermal holding. The deformation {{led to the formation}} of self-screening arrays of <b>microbands</b> within a majority of grains. The <b>microbands</b> characteristics underwent rather modest changes during the post-deformation annealing, which suggests that limited dislocation annihilation occurs within the corresponding dislocation walls. The fraction of statically recrystallized (SRX) grains progressively increased with the holding time and closely matched the softening fraction measured from the offset flow stress approach. The corresponding texture was weak and preserved its character with the holding time. There was no pronounced temperature effect on the grain boundary character distribution after the completion of SRX. The Σ 3 and Σ 9 coincidence site lattice boundaries were characterized as (111) pure twist and (1 − 14) symmetric tilt types, respectively. Nonetheless, the recrystallization temperature slightly affected the grain boundary network...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>microbands</b> in Precambrian banded-iron {{formations}} (BIFs) {{have been}} conjectured to record annual or even diurnal depositions. However, these bands have rarely {{been observed in}} high resolution at their true (micro) scale. Here, I suggest that nanobands of fine-grained hematite represent possible diurnal depositions and that <b>microbands</b> of chert/jasper represent possible annual depositions in three sets of BIFs: 2460 -Myr BIFs from the Kuruman Iron Formation, Transvaal Supergroup of South Africa; 2480 -Myr BIFs from the Dales Gorge Member of the Brockman Iron Formation, Western Australia; and 2728 -Myr BIFs from the Hunter Mine Group, Abitibi Greenstone Belt, Canada. Observations made using scanning electron microscopy indicate that hematite and chert were syngenetic, {{and that there was}} a hiatus between their precipitation and the genesis of the remainder of the minerals containing structural Fe(II). Spindle-like grains of hematite, monocrystals of magnetite, and ferro-dolomite formed <b>microbands</b> of ∼ 30 – 70 μm in thickness, which appear cyclically in the matrix of the chert. Neither the band-bound magnetite and dolomite nor the linear formations of the hematite spindles represent annual depositions due to their diagenetic features. The thinnest <b>microbands</b> (∼ 3 –∼ 12 μm) were observed in the chert and jasper, and indicate depositional rates of 6. 6 – 22. 2 m/Myr in the BIFs. These rates are consistent with the integrated deposition rates calculated by geochronologic methods for the BIFs, if annual deposition is assumed. The ∼ 26 -nm nanobands observed only in hematite grains reflect an annual deposition of ∼ 18. 6 μm, or ∼ 18. 6 m/Myr, which is also consistent with the depositional rate calculated by geochronologic methods. It is tentatively suggested that these ∼ 26 -nm nanobands were formed from the diurnal precipitation of Fe(III) resulting from the circadian metabolism of Fe(II) -oxidizing or oxygen-evolving photosynthetic microorganisms, which slowed down the rise of atmospheric oxygen. The diurnal precipitation of Fe(III) as hematite and the annual deposition of silica as chert/jasper in the BIFs provide internal clocks that may facilitate the examination of short-term processes, such as ecological, oceanographic and climatic cycles, that are recorded by the mineral or chemical compositions of BIFs...|$|R
