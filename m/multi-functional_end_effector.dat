40|$|Innovations in today's {{aircraft}} industry are mainly {{driven by the}} desire to increase production and flexibility, while reducing cost and delivering good quality products. Automated riveting has proven capable of reducing assembly time and work in process, achieving quality targets, and increasing flexibility through the minimization of product-specific jigs, fixtures and tooling. This paper describes the layout of the robotic cell for aerospace panel assembly developed at the University of Nottingham. The motivation for this project is to develop a flexible, automated and reconfigurable system for the riveting of aero-structure components based on multi-process workcells and parallel machine technology. The automated riveting process is made possible using a combination of replacing large C-Frame riveters with robots, <b>multi-functional</b> compact <b>end</b> <b>effectors,</b> utlising a multi threading mode of operation for the master controller, offline programming for robots guidance, and photogrammetry cameras for machine vision. Also, the human factor and its influence on this process have not been eliminated, but rather were given more challenging jobs such as process monitoring and offline programming in the attempt to pursue further optimization. The automated riveting process has shown promising results in terms of reliability, repeatability, quality management and reduction of throughput time...|$|R

30|$|In this research, {{the main}} purpose {{is to find the}} {{relationship}} between the circular motion of an <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> and the velocity of the rotational flow. By changing the frequency (50, 77, 100  Hz) and the amplitude (12, 15, 21  μm) of the circular motion, the water flow is analyzed. From the experimental data using 9.6 -μm microbeads and a theoretical model, we formulated two equations that can estimate the angular velocity of the rotational flow around the circular motion and the velocity toward the root of the <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> according to the frequency and the amplitude of the <b>end</b> <b>effector.</b> By using estimated velocities, we may control the velocity and position of a target object around the <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> precisely in 3 D. For example, the speed of the target can be controlled by tuning the frequency and the amplitude of the <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> motion. In addition, the positioning of the target object can be managed by adjusting the performance time of the circular motion of the <b>end</b> <b>effector.</b> This proposed method has possibility to manipulate a lot of objects by generating of rotational flow and transporting the <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> together.|$|R

This paper advances previously developed material handling <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> layout optimization methodology for rigid point <b>end</b> <b>effectors</b> [1] by developing a dexterous part-holding <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> model. This model overcomes the shortcomings of the rigid point part-holding <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> model by predicting part deformation more accurately for various modes of deformation and {{for a set of}} part-holding <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> locations. This is especially important for handling systems which utilize vacuum cup <b>end</b> <b>effectors</b> widely used for {{handling of}} large sheet metal parts.

The report defines functional requirements for <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> systems to perform operations that are currently only feasible through Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA). Specific tasks and functions that the <b>end</b> <b>effectors</b> must be capable of performing are delineated. Required capabilities for forces and torques, clearances, compliance, and sensing are described, using current EVA requirements as guidelines where feasible. The implications of these functional requirements on the elements of potential <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> systems are discussed. The systems issues that must be considered in the design of space-based manipulator systems are identified; including impacts on subsystems tightly coupled to the <b>end</b> <b>effector,</b> i. e., control station, information processing, manipulator arm, tool and equipment stowage. Possible <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> designs are divided into three categories: single degree-of-freedom <b>end</b> <b>effectors,</b> multiple degree of freedom <b>end</b> <b>effectors,</b> and anthropomorphic hands. Specific design alternatives are suggested and analyzed within the individual categories.

The analysis concludes that the anthropomorphic hand is best-suited for EVA tasks.

30|$|To {{generate}} the desired <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> motion precisely without the residual vibration, we fixed {{the length of}} the <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> at 16  mm and then carried out calibration by changing a calibration matrix. Generally, the longer {{the length of the}} <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> is, the more the vibration is. To suppress the vibration at high speed, it is better to select the length of <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> as short as possible. To generate a precise motion at high speed for formulating model clearly, we tried to suppress vibration less than 1  μm. We tested several lengths of <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> (14, 16, 18, 20, and 22  mm) and finally chose the length at 16  mm because the vibration is lower than 1  μm. As a result, we obtained an end-effector workspace of approximately 80  μm in X- and Z-directions and 10  μm in Y-direction. However, in high-speed motion (1  kHz), the vibration was still generated. To reduce the vibration of the <b>end</b> <b>effector,</b> a low-pass filter composed of an RC circuit was applied. Thus, the vibration at the high frequency of 1  kHz was remarkably reduced from over 5  μm to less than 0.5  μm.

The {{displacement of the}} three PZT actuators determines the 3 D position of the <b>end</b> <b>effector,</b> which can be measured by the strain gauges attached to the actuators. The extensions of the PZT actuators are measured by the strain gauges fixed to each PZT actuator; the signals are transferred to the Linux PC through an amplifier (Kyowa MCD- 16 A) and an analog-to-digital board [Contec AD 16 - 16 (PCI)EV]. The 3 D position of the <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> can be calculated using the obtained sensor data and compensated by a closed-loop PID controller. The desired voltage determined by computation of the sensor data is applied to each actuator through a digital-to-analog board [Contec DA 16 - 16 (LPCI)L] and an amplifier (MATSUSADA, HJPZ- 0.15 Px 3). The desired <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> motion can be generated by using point-to-point movements of an <b>end</b> <b>effector.</b> This motion includes accelerating of the <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> to a necessary speed and decelerating to a stop.

In particular, {{in the case of a}} laparoscopic assist robot, since the three basic axes must be operated under the trocar restriction, large motion of a forceps shaft is needed to change the posture of the <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> in a fixed state of a tool center point. Therefore, the influence of the offset is more serious, and to secure a sufficient working area, the three basic axes need to be enlarged. Also, the offset would render the wrist mechanism too large for laparoscopic applications.|$|R

In order to generate an applicable motion that can precisely control the speed and position of a target object around an <b>end</b> <b>effector,</b> a manipulator actuated by three piezoelectric actuators is proposed. A compact parallel link produces precise three-dimensional motions. To reach the required end-effector frequency and amplitude, which is necessary for generating the rotational flow that can make rotational movement of microbeads having patterned data, the <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> motion is generated by controlling the three piezoelectric actuators at high speed. In this paper, we focus on rotational flow created by two-dimensional circular motion of the <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> mounted on the parallel link.

The controller creates a passive and compliant behavior for regulating the center of mass (CoM) location, hip orientation and the poses of each <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> assigned to the interaction task.
