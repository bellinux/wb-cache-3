25|$|I am very {{grateful}} for the strong support and encouragement I have received from supporters {{across the country and}} the wonderful Texans I have met in every part of our great state. However, pressing personal challenges, coupled with the recent loss of our home due to fire and lagging fundraising numbers make a statewide election campaign impractical for <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time.|$|E
25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E
500|$|On June 24, 2015, {{when asked}} if there are plans for a {{possible}} sequel, Pete Docter replied, [...] "There's no sequel idea from <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point," [...] adding, [...] "Never say never." [...] On January 14, 2016, Docter stated that a sequel is possible, and that he and Pixar will explore ideas, saying: [...] "We'll see if anything turns up. To me it's not as simple as: 'We liked it, so let's make another one.' What happens is you design these characters not so much looks-wise but as they are as characters and people for a story. So we'll explore it and see what happens." [...] In a July 2016 interview, Pixar president Jim Morris said that while demand for a sequel is high, the company has committed its resources to several original movie concepts from June 7, 2019 onward, and that no sequels to any of Pixar's other films including Inside Out were being contemplated at this time.|$|E

[...] "The government and FCO are doing {{all they can to}} resist <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> difficult time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite being Ireland's {{official}} captain, Porterfield {{chose to}} represent his county (Gloucestershire) instead of leading Ireland in their ODIs against Scotland and New Zealand in July 2008 {{in an attempt}} to secure a permanent position at Gloucestershire. He said [...] "It's definitely the hardest decision I've ever had to make ... I feel it's the right decision for <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> stage in my career".|$|E
2500|$|Mandisa won the Best Contemporary Christian Music Album for Overcomer at the 56th Grammy Awards. The title {{song from}} the album also won Best Contemporary Christian Music Song for songwriters David Garcia, Ben Glover and Christopher Stevens. She {{declined}} to attend the Grammy Awards, however, saying, [...] "I have fallen prey to the alluring pull of flesh, pride, and selfish desires quite a bit recently. I knew that submerging myself into an environment that celebrates those things was risky for <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, old chap," [...] I replied. [...] "It wouldn't {{have been}} like you to throw <b>me</b> down <b>at</b> <b>this</b> stage. Whit, you're in trouble?" ...|$|R
60|$|BLAYNE. He is. He's {{going to}} be married in a few weeks. Markyn told <b>me</b> <b>at</b> the Judge's <b>this</b> evening. It's pukka.|$|R
6000|$|It struck <b>me</b> that <b>at</b> <b>this</b> he just faintly colored. He gave, at any rate, like a convalescent {{slightly}} fatigued, a languid {{shake of}} his head. [...] "I don't--I don't. I want to get away." ...|$|R
2500|$|Talking {{about the}} album, Goodrem stated that [...] "I {{wanted to make}} an album that {{reflected}} <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time in my life", [...] "Every song takes me {{to a place where}} I can remember what happened". She also stated [...] "The album is almost like a diary I have been keeping over the last two years", [...] "Every track has a meaning behind it that's personal to me. I have been looking forward to this day {{for a long time and}} I just hope that everyone likes the music as much as I loved making it".|$|E
2500|$|The US {{district}} court judge for the District of Columbia, Richard Leon, declared [...] on December 16, 2013 that the mass collection of metadata of Americans’ telephone records by the National Security Agency probably violates the fourth amendment prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures. “Given the limited record before <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point in the litigation – most notably, the utter lack of evidence that a terrorist attack has ever been prevented because searching the NSA database was faster than other investigative tactics – I have serious doubts about {{the efficacy of the}} metadata collection program as a means of conducting time-sensitive investigations in cases involving imminent threats of terrorism.” “Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of showing that their privacy interests outweigh the government’s interest in collecting and analysing bulk telephony metadata and therefore the NSA’s bulk collection program is indeed an unreasonable search under the fourth amendment,” he wrote.|$|E

60|$|An {{extraordinary}} bitterness possessed <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> {{invasion of}} the stupendous beautiful business of love by sordid necessity. I answered her with immense restraint.|$|E
60|$|Can you fancy our mental {{condition}} as we four stood looking mutely into each other's faces, with Seth Jepson sprawled out between us? It {{is difficult for}} <b>me,</b> even <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time, to understand all the fearsomeness of that moment.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh--h! That's a {{horse of}} another colour. I {{beg your pardon}} entirely, my dear fellow. Why did you not tell <b>me</b> <b>at</b> first that <b>this</b> is a match of your uncle's making?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The first owlet hatched {{sang the}} opening bars of [...] "Chi mi frena in tal momento", from the opera Lucia di Lammermoor.
