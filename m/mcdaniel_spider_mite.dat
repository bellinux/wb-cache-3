40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that pest species diversity enhances biological pest control with generalist predators, we studied the dynamics of three major pest species on greenhouse cucumber: Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood), and two-spotted <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> Tetranychus urticae Koch {{in combination with the}} predator species Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot. When <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> infested plants prior to predator release, predatory mites were not capable of controlling <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> populations in the absence of other pest species. A laboratory experiment showed that predators were hindered by the webbing of <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> In a greenhouse experiment, <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> leaf damage was lower in the presence of thrips and predators than in the presence of whiteflies and predators, but damage was lowest in the presence of thrips, whiteflies and predators. Whitefly control was also improved in the presence of thrips. The lower levels of <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> leaf damage probably resulted from (1) a strong numerical response of the predator (up to 50 times higher densities) when a second and third pest species were present in addition to <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> and (2) from A. swirskii attacking mobile <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> stages outside or near the edges of the <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> webbing. Interactions of <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> with thrips and whiteflies might also result in suppression of <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> However, when predators were released prior to <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> infestations in the absence of other pest species, but with pollen as food for the predators, we found increased suppression of <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> with increased numbers of predators released, confirming the role of predators in <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> control.

Infestation densities resulting in the induction of predator attractants were much lower than thus far assumed, i. e., predatory mites were significantly attracted to plants that were infested for 2 days with only one or four <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> per plant. Phytoseiulus persimilis showed a density-dependent response to volatiles from plants that were infested with different numbers of <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> Similarly, treating plants with increasing concentrations of JA also led to increased attraction of P. persimilis.

Approximately three-hundred genetic lines of hops were screened under insectory conditions during the 1965 growing season at Corvallis, Oregon. Reduction in fecundity was the basis for delineating <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> resistance. A commercial hop variety, Fuggle, was used as a standard, and the fecundity of <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> on this variety was arbitrarily set at 100 percent. Striking differences in fecundity was found during the screening experiments, and 24 varieties which showed 50 percent or less fecundity compared to the standard were re-screened during the 1966 season. Although the results of the 1966 re-screening program were not as striking as the data obtained during the 1965 screening experiments, six hop varieties were selected as possible resistant varieties and were compared to two commercial hop genotypes in a growth chamber under controlled environmental conditions.

Additionally, I used a model organism, tomato plants, to address the hypothesis of altered plant defenses in plants treated with imidacloprid.

The results suggest that monitoring for <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> must be done periodically throughout the entire plant production cycle and more attention should be given {{towards the end of the}} cycle. I found that measurements of visible leaf damage were correlated with plant marketability. Specifically, the level of damage (proportion of damaged leaves/plant) at which plant marketability changes from a ‘premium’ to a ‘discounted’ category was (0. 04 - 0. 06). Thus, regression equations of the damage threshold could be used to estimate a cumulative <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> density equivalent to the economic threshold.

40|$|Attack by {{multiple}} herbivores {{often leads to}} modification of induced plant defenses compared to single herbivory, yet {{little is known about}} the effects on induced indirect plant defense. Here, we investigated the effect of sequential induction of plant defense by Mamestra brassicae caterpillar oral secretion and an infestation by Tetranychus urticae <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> on the expression of indirect plant defense in Lima bean plants. The effect on indirect defense was assessed using behavior assays with the specialist predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis in an olfactometer, headspace analysis of 11 major herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) including (E) -ß-ocimene, and transcript levels of the corresponding gene Phaseolus lunatus (E) -ß-ocimene synthase (PlOS). Predatory mites were found to distinguish between plants induced by <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> and caterpillar oral secretion but not between plants with single <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> infestation and plants induced by caterpillar oral secretion prior to <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> infestation. Indeed, the volatile blends emitted by plants induced by <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> only and the sequential induction treatment of caterpillar oral secretion followed by <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> infestation, were similar. Our results suggest that plant indirect defense is not affected by previous treatment with oral secretion of M. brassicae caterpillars...|$|R
40|$|Spider mites (Acari: Tetranychidae) are an {{important}} agricultural pest of many crops and landscape plants. They can reproduce rapidly and quickly develop resistance to many pesticides, making them difficult to manage. Plant water-stress and high temperatures promote <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> infestations, while <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> outbreaks can also result from neonicotinoid insecticide applications. Drought is predicted to increase in the Intermountain West due to increases in temperature and reduced frequency of precipitation events in the region, and neonicotinoids are currently {{one of the most}} widely used classes of insecticides in field crops. I studied the interactive effect of these two simultaneously occurring abiotic factors on <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> outbreaks and plant biosynthesis of herbivore-related defense proteins. I also evaluated ways to alleviate <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> outbreaks with drought-tolerant corn and the exogenous application of plant phytohormones involved in plant resistance toward biotic stressors. I found that plant water-stress increased <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> and that neonicotinoids exacerbated the effect of water-stress. Although applications of plant hormones did not reduce the effect of water-stress and neonicotinoids, drought tolerant corn showed promise in reducing the effect of water-stress and <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> outbreaks...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} reported evidence for increased diapause incidence in the <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> Tetranychus urticae {{in the presence}} of the predatory mite Typhlodromus pyri. This effect may arise from (1) selective predation on non-diapause <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> (2) predator-induced diapause in <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> or (3) both. Using a different strain of T. urticae, we first recovered increased diapause incidence in association with predators. Then, we tested for selective feeding in two-choice experiments with equal numbers of non-diapause and diapause <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> We found that the predatory mite had a significant preference for the latter. This indicates that increased diapause incidence in association with predatory mites is not due to selective predation. Therefore, predator-mediated physiological induction of diapause seems a more likely explanation. The cues leading to induction appear to relate to the predators, not their effects, since predation simulated by spider-mite removal or puncturing did not significantly affect diapause incidence. Why <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> benefit from this response, remains an open question...|$|R
40|$|Cucurbitacins are bitter triterpenoid {{compounds}} that are toxic to most organisms and occur widely in wild and cultivated Cucurbitaceae. The only cucurbitacin identified in Cucumis sativus is cucurbitacin C. The bitter taste of cucumber has been correlated with {{resistance to the}} <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> Tetranychus urticae, but a quantitative relationship has not been established. We determined the <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> resistance and cucurbitacin C content in the dihaploid progeny derived from the F 1 generation of {{a cross between a}} bitter, spider-mite-resistant cucumber line and a bitter-free, spider-mite-susceptible line. The ratio of the number of bitter to bitter-free dihaploids conformed to the expected 1 : 1 ratio, based on a monogenic segregation pattern. Genetic analysis ascribed 69 % of the variance of the difference in <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> survival rate to the bitterness locus. Within the group of bitter dihaploids, cucurbitacin C content was significantly correlated with <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> resistance. Thus, a quantitative relationship between cucurbitacin C content and <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> resistance could be establishe...|$|R
40|$|The two-spotted <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> Tetranychus urticae Koch {{is one of}} {{the most}} common plant pests, feeding on leaves. The damage caused by this mite on tomato Lycopersicon esculentum Mill was {{classified}} in five visual degrees of a damage on leaflets index, each related to a mean <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> density. According to these visual damages, the injury to leaflets was further investigated by analysing two important physiological processes: photosynthesis through assimilation of CO 2, and transpiration through stomatal resistance to water diffusion. As results, the assimilation Of CO 2 decreased exponentially with the increasing damage, whereas the density of the total <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> was related to the latest by a positive exponential relation. On the other hand, the resistance to water diffusion was not well related to <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> damage; it only appeared that the stomatal resistance increase was very limited until damage degree three, corresponding to a mean of 23 <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> by dm 2, was reached...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> such as the two-spotted <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> (Tetranychus urticae) are important allergens for fruit farmers. A total of 2, 467 adults (795 metropolitan urban, 788 non-metropolitan urban, and 884 rural subjects) were enrolled. They responded to the questionnaire, and underwent methacholine bronchial provocation tests as well as skin prick tests to locally common aeroallergens including the two-spotted <b>spider</b> <b>mite.</b> The prevalences of asthma and rhinitis as reported on the questionnaire were 7. 8 % and 16. 4 % of adults aged 20 - 35, 9. 4 % and 24. 7 % of those 36 - 50, and 17. 7 % and 21. 7 % of those older than 50, respectively. Among the older group, the two-spotted <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> {{was the most common}} sensitizing allergen, although it was second of that of house dust mites among the other two age groups. Sensitization to the two-spotted <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> was significantly associated with the prevalence of asthma and rhinitis among the younger age group, and associated with the prevalence of rhinitis among the older age group. The two-spotted <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> might be a common sensitizing allergen in the general population of adults, and sensitization to this mite {{may play a role in}} the manifestation of asthma and rhinitis symptoms during adulthood...|$|R
40|$|The <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> Tetranychus urticae Koch is {{a serious}} pest in field crops, {{glasshouse}} vegetables and fruit crops. It is a generalist herbivore with several hundreds of host plant species. Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot {{is one of its}} natural enemies. Investigations of the tritrophic system of plant, T. urticae and P. persimilis will contribute to a better knowledge about the direct and indirect defence defensive strategies of plant species. Host plant acceptance by the <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> T. urticae, as a measure of the plant?s direct defence, was investigated for eleven plant species. The degree to which the <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> accepted a plant was expected to depend on differences in nutritive and toxic constituents among plant species. At the level of plant species, a large variation in the degree of acceptance by T. urticae was found. Except for ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) most plants were accepted or well accepted by the <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> At the level of plant family, four plant species from the Fabaceae were compared to four plant species from the Solanaceae. It was shown that all species from the Fabaceae were accepted by the <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> for feeding, while plant species from the Solanaceae varied in <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> acceptance from well accepted (tobacco: Nicotiana tabacum) to poorly accepted (sweet pepper: Capsicum annuum...|$|R
