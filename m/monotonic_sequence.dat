5000|$|In {{computer}} science, a monotone {{priority queue}} is {{a variant of}} the priority queue abstract data type in which the priorities of extracted items are required to form a <b>monotonic</b> <b>sequence.</b> That is, for a priority queue in which each successively extracted item is the one with the minimum priority (a min-heap), the minimum priority should be monotonically increasing.

50|$|The Lotus Twelve was {{the first}} to use the infamous Lotus 'Queerbox' transaxle. This was {{developed}} to be, in typical Chapman fashion, the smallest and lightest five-speed transmission possible, also to have a low driveshaft line allowing a low driving position, thus lower centre of mass and air resistance. Chapman also chose a transaxle over the usual gearbox and rear axle layout, as had been used in the first Twelve, as this gave a lower polar moment of inertia. The initial design, the work of Chapman and Harry Mundy, began with the principle of the most compact layout, with the gear cluster arranged in a closely spaced stack, akin to a motorcycle. As the gears shared common axes, and all teeth were cut to the same size, all the pairs of gear had the same number of teeth in total, 44. The stack was only 3+5//8 in long overall. This was likely to require sequential shifting, but that was no drawback in a racing car. The gears would also be easily changeable, to suit different circuits. Gears could be used with the same ratio in any position, to suit both hillclimbing or fast circuits, provided that they remained in a <b>monotonic</b> <b>sequence.</b>|$|E

30|$|Modeling {{to study}} the {{performance}} of wireless networks {{in recent years has}} produced sets of nonlinear equations with interrelated parameters. Because these nonlinear equations have no closed-form solution, the numerical values of the parameters are calculated by iterative algorithms. In a Markov chain model of a wireless cellular network, one commonly used expression for calculating the handoff arrival rate can lead to a sequence of oscillating iterative values that fail to converge. We present an algorithm that generates a <b>monotonic</b> <b>sequence,</b> and we prove that the <b>monotonic</b> <b>sequence</b> always converges. Lastly, we give a further algorithm that converges logarithmically, thereby permitting the handoff arrival rate to be calculated very quickly to any desired degree of accuracy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA uniform {{treatment}} of specifications, programs, and programming is presented.
