5000|$|Doctor Zachary Smith, the family's physician, {{turns out}} to be a spy for the Sedition who sabotages the ship's <b>maintenance</b> <b>robot</b> before launch, but is betrayed by his cohorts and left {{unconscious}} as an unwitting stowaway as the ship launches and the family enters cryosleep for the journey. The robot activates soon after they are asleep, and following its corrupted programming, begins to destroy the navigation and guidance systems, en route to destroying the family itself. Smith awakens the sleeping Robinsons and their pilot West, who manages to subdue the robot; yet due to the robot's actions, the ship is falling uncontrollably into the sun. Using the experimental hyperdrive, which has an unpredictable trajectory without a hypergate to go through, the ship is transported through hyperspace to a remote and uncharted part of the universe, where their known star charts are useless. Finding strange distortions in space, the crew boards a wayward vessel, with Will controlling the now-modified robot by remote-control to aid them. Finding technology more advanced than theirs, along with a camouflaging creature whom Penny calls [...] "Blarp," [...] they are attacked by alien spider-like creatures; in their escape, Dr. Smith is bitten by one of them. Pilot West ignores orders and destroys the vessel to eradicate the spiders, and as a result, the ship crash-lands on a nearby planet—where the distortions seemingly continue. Young Will theorizes that they are distortions in time; in fact, they are his science experiment's predicted results. His father, however, frustrates Will by ignoring his input. His father and West head off to explore one of these time bubbles, and encounter future versions of Will and Smith, the latter having been unwittingly transformed by the spider bite into a kind of anthropomorphic creature. The future Will explains that the spiders had attacked after his father and West had left them, and that Maureen, Penny and Judy were all killed; the transformed Dr. Smith had been protecting Will ever since. Constructing a time machine of his own, Will intends to go back to Earth prior to the launch of Jupiter II, and prevent it from happening.|$|E
5000|$|After the Worldstorm event rewrote the Wildstorm universe, Christine and Jackson's destinies had changed; now, {{they were}} again {{in charge of}} a much-scaled-down Stormwatch Prime, {{operating}} exclusively out of the United States and in a gigantic skyscraper serving as Skywatch instead of the former orbital satellite. Jackson and Christine's marriage seemed rock solid as they continued to run both Stormwatch Prime and the new, human-oriented Stormwatch: Post Human Division task force. But when a meeting of the minds was arranged between the members of Prime and PHD at Skywatch, the heroes made a shocking discovery: Jackson King {{had been shot in the}} head, with a high-powered laser instead of a bullet. Jackson remained comatose while the members of Stormwatch PHD investigated the crime and interrogated suspects. To their shock, they eventually discovered that the culprit was none other than Christine. In her confession, Christine revealed that she and Jackson had recently risked a pregnancy, despite fearing that their altered genetics would damage the baby, and that the baby was indeed miscarried and deformed. After the miscarriage, apparently suffering from delusion and postpartum depression, Christine became fixated on getting Jackson to take his focus off Stormwatch and onto the family they could still create, by any means necessary. She reprogrammed a Skywatch <b>maintenance</b> <b>robot</b> to attack Jackson with one of its lasers, knowing Jackson would not detect its intentions because the robot had no mind. She also programmed the robot to aim not for Jackson's cognitive faculties, but for the part of the brain that controlled Jackson's powers; as an Activator, the unbalanced Christine knew where to look, and believed that without his powers, Jackson would learn to settle down into family life. As a regretful Christine was taken into custody, Jackson awoke from his coma in full control of his faculties and his powers, and was heartbroken to learn what Christine had done. Christine expressed gratitude that Jackson had kept his powers, and as she was led away, said she should never have done it; [...] "no one should ever be taken away from what they love." ...|$|E

40|$|Manned {{spacecraft}} {{will require}} maintenance robots to inspect and repair {{components of the}} spacecraft that are only accessible from the outside. This paper presents a design of a novel free-flying <b>maintenance</b> <b>robot</b> (known as a MaintenanceBot.) The Maintenance-Bot uses Control Moment Gyros (CMGs) for manipulator arm and attitude control. This provides high authority control in a compact low power package. Relative position and attitude determination is accomplished with an RF system supplemented by a vision system at close range. When not docked to the manned vehicle (which must be done periodically to refuel and recharge batteries or when the manned vehicle performs orbit changes) the MaintenanceBots fly in formation using a cold gas thruster system and formation flying algorithms that permit dozens of MaintenanceBots to coordinate their positions. The use of CMGs is a prominent feature of this design. An array of CMGs can exchange angular momentum with the spacecraft body to effect attitude changes, as long as certain mathematical singularities in the actuator Jacobian are avoided. The proposed <b>maintenance</b> <b>robot</b> benefits dramatically from the dynamics and control of a multibody robotic arm whose joints are driven by CMGs. In addition to high power efficiency, another advantage of this concept is that spacecraft appendages actuated by CMGs can be considered reactionless, {{in the sense that}} careful manipulation of the CMG gimbal angles can virtually eliminate moments applied to the spacecraft body. This paper provides a preliminary design of the MaintenanceBot. Analysis of the formation flying and close maneuver control systems is included. Simulation results for a typical operation is provided. I...|$|E
50|$|In this stage, {{the player}} has to destroy <b>maintenance</b> <b>robots</b> that feed coolant into the reactor.

The player is provided with several disc grenades that he throws at the robot, which is moving and firing at him the entire time. The robot is reinforced at the front, so {{the only way to do}} any damage is to bounce the discs off the wall and hit the robot in the back. As the number of discs is limited, the player should attempt to catch returning discs which missed the robot. To successfully complete the game, all robots must be defeated, the final one within a two-minute time limit. If the robot is not destroyed within the limit the game is still considered complete, but with no survivors.|$|R
40|$|Power line {{inspection}} and <b>maintenance</b> <b>robots</b> {{have been developed}} {{for more than two decades}} as a substitute for linemen to work under the dangerous working condition. The fault and obstacle detection through the information collected by robot sensors is an important research filed. Currently, visual information remains the most common, practical and easily collected data for robots amongst all kinds of sensing data. This paper presents a visual detection method for the broken strand fault. The broken strand fault can be detected by judging the intensity distribution of histogram of edge gradient(HOEG) in the following steps: at first, the region of interest (ROI) of captured images is selected; then, the HOEG descriptor is extracted in ROI as image feature; at last, the intensity distribution of HOEG descriptor can differentiate the broken strand fault from the normal wire. In addition, the location of detected broken strand fault is given for the practical repair.

40|$|The {{broken strand}} of {{overhead}} ground wire (OGW), which is {{mainly caused by}} lightning strikes or the vibration of OGW, can lead to serious damage to the power grid system.

First, we obtain the region of interest (ROI) from the image acquired by the robot. Second, a histogram of an oriented gradients descriptor vector is calculated to obtain the image gradient feature in ROI.

40|$|AbstractRecently, {{the number}} of {{high-rise}} building has increased along {{with the development of}} technology to cope with the increase in population. Because of this, many researches on an automatic building façade maintenance system have been conducted to satisfy the increasing demands of façade maintenance. However, most researches have focused on the mechanism and system composition, while working safety issues have not been sufficiently dealt with. This paper deals with the motion control issues of the building façade <b>maintenance</b> <b>robot</b> system which is composed of a vertical robot and a horizontal robot moving along the rail of the façade. With consideration for the vertical robot, these issues include the safety of docking process and the stability of vertical motion. During the docking process for the inter-floor circulation of the horizontal robot, shocks and positioning errors are generated due to increasing load. To solve this, the rail brake system is operated to suppress the shock during the docking process, and a re-leveling process is conducted to compensate the gap which is equal to the positioning error between the built-in transom rail of the robot and the transom rail of the building. In addition, many noises are generated from the surroundings that significantly affect the motion of the vertical robot due to vibration. To enhance the motion stability of the vertical robot, vibration suppression control is developed in this paper, using the state estimation which considers the dynamic properties of the wire rope. For the feasibility of this algorithm, the field experiment of the building façade <b>maintenance</b> <b>robot</b> is conducted...|$|E

In this method, an Affine Scale Invariant Feature Transform (Affine-SIFT) algorithm is proposed to extract enough local feature points with a fully affine invariant, and the stable matching point is obtained from the above point for target recognition by the selected Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. Then, in order to localize the target, the effective and appropriate 3 D grasping scope of the target is defined, and we determine and evaluate the grasping precision with the estimated affine transformation parameters presented in this paper. Finally, the threshold of RANSAC is optimized to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of target recognition and localization, and the scopes of illumination, vision distance and viewpoint angle for robot are evaluated to obtain effective image data by Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE). An experimental system to simulate the illumination environment in a space station is established. Enough experiments have been carried out, and the experimental results show both the validity of the proposed definition of the grasping scope and the feasibility of the proposed recognition and localization method...|$|E
