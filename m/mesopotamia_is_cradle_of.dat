50|$|Tell Hassuna {{is located}} {{approximately}} 35 km southwest of modern Mosul, {{along the west}} bank of the Tigris River. It is a small site, roughly 200 x 150 m and about 7 m high. Hassuna was one of the earliest cultures in Northern Mesopotamia. Before this time, Southern <b>Mesopotamia</b> <b>was</b> considered the <b>cradle</b> <b>of</b> civilization. When settlements began forming in the north, such as Hassuna, Jarmo, Samarra, and Tell Halaf, the north became the important region. The architecture at Hassuna was built of packed mud, with the width varying from 20 to 50 centimeters. The mud-brick technique may perhaps have been developed in Southern <b>Mesopotamia,</b> where mud-bricks <b>were</b> common in the first half of 6th millennium B.C.|$|R
