5|$|Heisenberg's {{uncertainty}} principle predicts {{that during the}} inflationary phase there would be quantum thermal fluctuations, which would be <b>magnified</b> to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the universe. Inflation predicts that the primordial fluctuations are nearly scale invariant and Gaussian, which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, a {{time when}} federal aid for urban renewal was plentiful, Albany did not have growth in its economy or infrastructure. It lost more than 20 percent of its {{population}} during the Corning years, as people moved to newer housing in the suburbs, followed {{by most of the}} downtown businesses moving there as well. While cities across the country grappled with similar issues, the problems were <b>magnified</b> in Albany: interference from the Democratic political machine hindered progress considerably.|$|E

5|$|Electron {{holography}} is an {{imaging technique}} that photographically records the electron interference pattern of an object, {{which is then}} reconstructed to yield a greatly <b>magnified</b> image of the original object. This technique was developed to enable greater resolution in electron microscopy than is possible using conventional imaging techniques. The resolution of conventional electron microscopy is not limited by electron wavelength, but by the large aberrations of electron lenses.|$|E
5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387 was a {{gravitational}} microlensing event {{detected by}} the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics collaboration on July 24, 2009, which searches and documents chance and brief alignments of stars with other stars or objects; such alignments cause a gravitational lens effect, which bends light and causes distorted, but <b>magnified,</b> images {{that can be}} interpreted. The detection of two caustics were logged {{over the next few}} days by the South African Astronomical Observatory, the Perth Observatory, and the Canopus Hill Observatory in Tasmania, with a separation of about seven days between caustic events.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of the election was <b>magnified</b> due to Finland's capacity to influence the European Union's decision in regard to affecting a bailout for Portugal via the European Financial Stability Facility, as part of financial support systems for debt-laden European countries, and {{the fall of the}} Portuguese government. Small differences in the opinion polls for the traditional three big parties (the National Coalition Party, the Centre Party and the Social Democratic Party) and the surprising rise in support for the True Finns also electrified the atmosphere ahead of the election.|$|E
50|$|Virtual <b>Magnifying</b> Glass is {{designed}} for the visually impaired and others who need to <b>magnify</b> part of the computer display. Unlike most similar programs, it does not open a separate program window for the magnification but instead puts a movable <b>magnifying</b> glass on the screen.|$|R
40|$|Students {{will learn}} about {{magnification}} {{and how a}} <b>magnifying</b> lens works. They will examine {{a variety of different}} objects, first without a magnifier and then with a magnifier, and compare what they observe. They will practice observing details of these objects with <b>magnifying</b> lens. The purpose of this activity is for students to learn about observation skills and how tools can help people make observations, what "magnification" means, and to learn that scientists use tools, such as <b>magnifying</b> lenses, to examine objects. Students will be able to identify a <b>magnifying</b> glass and its purposes. They will be able to describe how the same object looks different when using the unaided eye versus a <b>magnifying</b> lens. Educational levels: Primary elementary, Intermediate elementary...|$|R

5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} is very thin {{compared}} to its lateral dimensions. If a typical mammalian cell (diameter ~10 micrometers) were <b>magnified</b> {{to the size}} of a watermelon (~1ft/30cm), the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about as thick as a piece of office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section. These regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized over the past several decades with x-ray reflectometry, neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.|$|E
5|$|The {{property}} that makes neurons unique is {{their ability to}} send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send these signals {{by means of an}} axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell, (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were <b>magnified</b> so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally <b>magnified,</b> would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer. These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials.|$|E
5|$|These {{concerns}} were further <b>magnified</b> in late 2006, when Pathan conceded 54 runs in six overs {{in the first}} two matches of a triangular ODI tournament in Malaysia. Despite scoring 64 in the top-order in the first of these matches against the West Indies, Pathan was dropped {{for the rest of the}} tournament. He appeared to have run into some form during the Challenger Trophy when he took five wickets at 15.80 at an economy rate of 4.64 and scored 95 runs at 31.66 in three matches.|$|E

30|$|Given the above, we {{hypothesized}} that, {{in response to}} PE, <b>magnify</b> should be an adaptive emotion socialization strategy, and override a maladaptive strategy. We therefore expected that reward (PE and NE), <b>magnify</b> (PE), and override (NE) should correlate positively with emotional warmth and negatively with rejection or overprotection. The inverse relation was expected for punish, neglect (PE and NE), override (PE), and <b>magnify</b> (NE).|$|R
50|$|Some {{kinds of}} <b>magnifying</b> glasses, made {{specifically}} for reading wide columns of print, are cylindrical lenses. For a simple cylindrical lens, {{the surfaces of}} the lens are portions of a cylinder's surface. Consider how this would refract light. When a cylindrical lens acts as a magnifier, it <b>magnifies</b> only in one direction. For example, the magnifier shown <b>magnifies</b> letters only in height, not in width.|$|R
5|$|Within the constellation's borders lie NGC 2419, {{an unusually}} remote {{globular}} cluster; the galaxy NGC 2770, which has hosted three recent Type Ib supernovae; the distant quasar APM 08279+5255, whose light is <b>magnified</b> and split into multiple images by the gravitational lensing {{effect of a}} foreground galaxy; and the Lynx Supercluster, which was the most distant supercluster known {{at the time of}} its discovery in 1999.|$|E
5|$|A common {{situation}} in ski jumping, and especially ski flying {{due to the}} <b>magnified</b> risks overall, arises when unfavourable weather conditions cause a competition to be cut short or cancelled completely; it is also not uncommon for an entire event to be cancelled. Reasons include strong winds, a lack of (or too much) snow, and poor visibility for athletes or judges. In {{the case of a}} shortened competition, the scores from the first round – if completed – are used to determine the final result. This is called a single-round competition and still counts towards both the Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup. For the World Championships, if one of the two competitions is cancelled, the final result will be based on the competition that took place.|$|E
5|$|A {{prototype}} for the Kinetoscope {{was shown to}} a convention of the National Federation of Women's Clubs on May 20, 1891. The first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope {{was held at the}} Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. Instrumental to the birth of American movie culture, the Kinetoscope also had a major impact in Europe; its influence abroad was <b>magnified</b> by Edison's decision not to seek international patents on the device, facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on the technology. In 1895, Edison introduced the Kinetophone, which joined the Kinetoscope with a cylinder phonograph. Film projection, which Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope's individual exhibition model. Many of the projection systems developed by Edison's firm in later years would use the Kinetoscope name.|$|E

40|$|Tartof {{showed that}} ribosomal gene {{magnification}} in Drosophila was inhibited {{in a ring}} X chromosome. The present studies extend this observation by showing that ring X chromosomes are lost meiotically in male Drosophila undergoing ribosomal gene magnification {{as evidenced by the}} recovery of a lower number of ring-bearing progeny under <b>magnifying</b> conditions compared with nonmagnifying conditions. Associated with ring chromosome loss is a highly significant {{increase in the number of}} double-sized dicentric ring chromosomes in meiotic cells from <b>magnifying</b> males. These observations explain the failure of ring X chromosomes to <b>magnify</b> and imply that magnification in rod chromosomes occurs via a mechanism of unequal sister chromatid exchange. Our results support the hypothesis that the primary event of magnification is a sister chromatid exchange in the rDNA, that the frequency of sister strand exchanges is increased in <b>magnifying</b> flies, that a significant number of exchanges in <b>magnifying</b> flies occurs meiotically and that some of the exchanges are nonreciprocal. We have also found that autosomal mutations can affect both the frequency of abnormal ring structures and the ability of ring X chromosomes to <b>magnify...</b>|$|R

5|$|APM 08279+5255 {{is a very}} distant, broad {{absorption}} line quasar discovered in 1998 and initially considered the most luminous object yet found. It is <b>magnified</b> and split into multiple images by the gravitational lensing effect of a foreground galaxy through which its light passes. It {{appears to be a}} giant elliptical galaxy with a supermassive black hole around 23 billion times as massive as the Sun and an associated accretion disk that has a diameter of 3600 light years. The galaxy possesses large regions of hot dust and molecular gas, as well as regions with starburst activity. It has a cosmological redshift of 3.911. While observing the quasar in 2008, astronomers using ESA's XMM Newton and the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) in Arizona discovered the huge galaxy cluster 2XMM J083026+524133.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{troops of}} the {{competing}} archbishops of Cologne fought over control of sections of the territory. Several of the barons and counts holding territory with feudal obligations to the Elector also held territory in nearby Dutch provinces; Westphalia, Liege and the Southern, or Spanish Netherlands. Complexities of enfeoffment and dynastic appanage <b>magnified</b> a localized feud into one including supporters from the Electorate of the Palatinate and Dutch, Scots and English mercenaries on the Protestant side, and Bavarian and papal mercenaries on the Catholic side. In 1586, the conflict expanded further, with the direct involvement of Spanish troops and Italian mercenaries on the Catholic side, and financial and diplomatic support from Henry III of France and Elizabeth I of England on the Protestant side.|$|E
5|$|Potentially precancerous {{changes in}} the cervix can be {{detected}} by cervical screening, using methods including a Pap smear (also called a cervical smear), in which epithelial cells are scraped {{from the surface of}} the cervix and examined under a microscope. The colposcope, an instrument used to see a <b>magnified</b> view of the cervix, was invented in 1925. The Pap smear was developed by Georgios Papanikolaou in 1928. A LEEP procedure using a heated loop of platinum to excise a patch of cervical tissue was developed by Aurel Babes in 1927. In some parts of the developed world including the UK, the Pap test has been superseded with liquid-based cytology.|$|E
30|$|For the NE, we had {{different}} expectations. We considered that reward and override were adaptive emotion socialization practices, while neglect, punish, and <b>magnify</b> were not. Indeed, parents perceived as using more reward and override {{were also more}} emotionally warm (positive MRP) and used less negative MRP, like rejection and overprotection (this last only for reward). Neglect use was associated with higher rejection and neglect of sadness and fear with overprotection; punish of sadness and anger with overprotection; and <b>magnify</b> with overprotection and <b>magnify</b> of anger with rejection. Finally, neglect was associated with less emotionally warm parenting, but contrary to our expectations, we found positive correlations with punish and <b>magnify.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>magnifying</b> {{transmitter}} is {{an advanced}} version of Tesla coil transmitter. It {{is a high}} power harmonic oscillator that Nikola Tesla intended for the wireless transmission of electrical energy. In his autobiography, Tesla stated that [...] "[...] [...] I feel certain that of all my inventions, the <b>Magnifying</b> Transmitter will prove most important and valuable to future generations." [...] The <b>magnifying</b> transmitter is an air-core, multiple-resonant transformer that can generate very high voltages.|$|R
50|$|Longer lenses <b>magnify</b> {{the subject}} more, {{apparently}} compressing distance and (when {{focused on the}} foreground) blurring the background because of their shallower depth of field. Wider lenses tend to <b>magnify</b> distance between objects while allowing greater depth of field.|$|R
5|$|The fire {{may have}} been caused by the {{accidental}} ignition of polyurethane foam insulation used on the building's outer walls. In China, the foam is commonly used as insulation material without the addition of flame retardants, and the foam produces toxic gases and carbon monoxide when burned. The Beijing Television Cultural Center was said to have used polyurethane insulation, which <b>magnified</b> the ferocity of a 2009 fire that consumed the center. In a 24 November press conference, local authorities said that the two apartments next to the destroyed building would be renovated as well, and that foam cladding on their exteriors would be switched out in favor of fire-resistant materials. Chinese citizens have also questioned the lack of an indoor fire sprinkler system in high rise buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{programme}} also disproved {{claims that}} some {{deterioration in the}} quality of the gunpowder would have prevented the explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder, of such low quality as to make it unusable in firearms, when placed in a heap and ignited, still managed to create a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been <b>magnified</b> by its containment in wooden barrels, compensating for the quality of the contents. The compression would have created a cannon effect, with the powder first blowing up {{from the top of the}} barrel before, a millisecond later, blowing out. Calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of gunpowder, had deployed double the amount needed.|$|E
5|$|Alfred also {{assisted}} {{his own son}} {{by promoting}} men who could be relied on to support him, and by giving him opportunities for command in battle once he was old enough. In the view of Barbara Yorke, the compilation of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which <b>magnified</b> Alfred's achievements, may have been partly intended to strengthen {{the case for the}} succession of his own descendants. However, Yorke also argues that Æthelwold's position was not fatally undermined by Alfred's will. His mother had witnessed a charter as regina, whereas Alfred followed West Saxon tradition in refusing to have his wife consecrated as queen, and Æthelwold's status as the son of a queen may have given him an advantage over Edward. Æthelwold was still the senior ætheling, and the only surviving charter he witnessed shows both him and Edward as filius regis (son of a king), but lists Æthelwold above Edward, implying that he ranked above him.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} a <b>magnifying</b> device was a joke in Aristophanes's The Clouds from 424 BC, where <b>magnifying</b> lenses to start kindling were sold in a pharmacy, and Pliny the Elder's [...] "lens", a glass globe filled with water, used to cauterize wounds. (Seneca wrote {{that it could be}} used to read letters [...] "no matter how small or dim"). Roger Bacon described the properties of a <b>magnifying</b> glass in 13th-century England.
