The state agency Kyrgyzaltyn owns all mines, many of which are operated as joint ventures with foreign companies. Uranium and antimony, important <b>mineral</b> <b>outputs</b> of the Soviet era, no longer are produced in significant amounts. Although between 1992 and 2003 coal output dropped from about 2.4 million tons to 411,000 tons, the government plans to increase exploitation of Kyrgyzstan’s considerable remaining deposits (estimated at 2.5 billion tons) in order to reduce dependency on foreign energy sources. A particular target of this policy is the Kara-Keche deposit in northern Kyrgyzstan, whose annual output capability is estimated at between 500,000 and 1 million tons. The small domestic output of oil and natural gas does not meet national needs.|$|R
50|$|The {{proposed}} branch was speculative, in {{the sense}} that large scale <b>mineral</b> <b>output</b> was not yet taking place at the mines to be served, and the TVR delayed construction of the line accordingly.

40|$|South Africa is {{a uniquely}} mineral rich country. Of the six types of {{asbestiform}} minerals {{found in the}} country, three, namely crocidolite, amosite and chrysotile were mined and milled on a large commercial scale. Asbestos was used locally in South Africa, {{but the majority of}} its production was exported worldwide. In the 1970 s, South Africa was the world’s third largest producer of asbestos, behind Canada and the USSR. About 97 % of the world’s production of crocidolite and virtually all of the amosite came from South Africa. The output from the South African asbestos mining industry peaked at 380, 000 tonnes in 1977 and declined thereafter as export markets declined due to restrictive legislation in countries that imported asbestos (Virta, 2006; Kielkowski et al., 2011). Legislation in South Africa banning the use of all types of asbestos came into effect in 2008, well after the last asbestos mine ceased production in 2001 and closed in 2002. Although South Africa benefitted financially from the exploitation of its asbestos mineral reserves, the revenue from asbestos never accounted for more than 3 % of the value of its total <b>minerals</b> <b>output</b> (McCulloch, 2003).

To save expense the company moved its office from London to Blakeney, and at the meeting there on 15 August 1858 {{it was reported that}} work had been suspended because many shareholders had not paid up their calls. In the following February the directors were able to obtain sufficient credit to permit Morris to resume work. During the session of 1860 the company applied for an extension of time until June 1862, which they received, together with powers for the South Wales Railway to work the line when opened, and to make enhanced siding provision at Awre, where there was to be a junction with the SWR main line. The success of the South Wales Railway showed that onward transport of the <b>mineral</b> <b>output</b> from collieries on the FODCR might be by rail in preference to river movement.|$|E

In any case the principal market for the <b>mineral</b> <b>output</b> was at the ironworks at Merthyr, Dowlais and nearby. The Ogmore Valley Railway was opened in 1865 to convey the minerals to Tondu, joining there the Llynvi Valley Railway; the two railways combined to form the Llynvi and Ogmore Railway in 1866. The Ogmore Valley Railway had been built as a narrow (standard) gauge line, and the Llynvi line and other nearby lines were broad gauge lines. The OVR urgently needed a narrow gauge connection, and the Taff Vale was the obvious partner to supply it. However relations were not friendly, and competing Parliamentary Bills were presented in successive sessions, also by the Great Western Railway and the Ely Valley Railway.|$|E

50|$|The mineral {{industry}} of Kazakhstan {{is one of}} the most competitive and fastest growing sectors of the country. Kazakhstan ranks second to Russia among the countries of the CIS in its quantity of mineral production. It is endowed with large reserves of a wide range of metallic ores, industrial minerals, and fuels, and its metallurgical sector is a major producer of a large number of metals from domestic and imported raw materials. In 2005, its metal mining sector produced bauxite, chromite, copper, iron, lead, manganese, and zinc ores, and its metallurgical sector produced such metals as beryllium, bismuth, cadmium, copper, ferroalloys, lead, magnesium, rhenium, steel, titanium, and zinc. The country produced significant amounts of other nonferrous and industrial mineral products, such as alumina, arsenic, barite, gold, molybdenum, phosphate rock, and tungsten. The country was a large producer of mineral fuels, including coal, natural gas, oil, and uranium. The country’s economy is heavily dependent on the production of <b>minerals.</b> <b>Output</b> from Kazakhstan’s <b>mineral</b> and natural resources sector for 2004 accounted for 74.1% of the value of industrial production, of which 43.1% came from the oil and gas condensate extraction.

40|$|Preface] The {{detailed}} {{geological survey}} of the country described in this bulletin commenced in 1953 and was completed in 1956 with the mapping of 1, 480 square miles of country. Information is supplied on 227 mines which produced mica alone or both mica and beryl, and 134 mines which produced only beryl. In addition, wolfram, gold, graphite, kyanite and rutile deposits and mines are described. <b>Mineral</b> <b>outputs</b> are given up to end of 1959. The field mapping and writing of the bulletin is entirely the work of Mr. Wiles. Mapping of the Field has established that, with a few exceptions, a metamorphic control has operated {{in the development of}} economic sheet mica and has led to the conclusion that very many of these pegmatites are composite bodies which have derived their material from two sources: one metamorphic and the other igneous. This conclusion was arrived at after a detailed petrographic investigation of the metamorphic rocks. The map {{at the end of this}} bulletin was drawn by Mr. A. H. Barrie and the diagrams are largely the work of Mr. D. O. L. Levy. Chemical analyses are by Messrs. A. J. Radford and E. Golding and were made in the Geological Survey Laboratory.

40|$|An {{experiment}} with 224 weaner pigs (initial BW of 7. 8 kg) {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of dose of dietary phytase supplementation on apparent fecal digestibility of minerals (P, Ca, Mg, Na, K, and Cu) and on performance. Four blocks, each with 8 pens of 7 pigs, were formed. Eight dietary treatments were applied to each block in the 43 -d experiment: supplementation of 0 (basal diet), 100, 250, 500, 750, 1, 500, or 15, 000 phytase units (FTU) or of 1. 5 g of digestible P (dP; monocalcium phosphate; positive control) per kilogram of feed. The basal diet, with corn, barley, soybean meal, and sunflower seed meal as the main components, contained 1. 2 g of dP per kilogram of feed. Fresh fecal grab samples were collected in wk 4 and 5 of the experiment. Average daily feed intake, ADG, G:F, and digestibility of all of the minerals increased (P < 0. 001) with increasing Phytase dose. Digestibility of P increased from 34 % in the basal diet to a maximum of 84 % in the diet supplemented with 15, 000 FTU, generating 1. 76 g of dP per kilogram of feed. At this level, 85 % of the phytate phosphorus was digested, compared with 15 % in the basal diet. Compared with the basal diet, digestibility of the monovalent minerals increased maximally at 15, 000 FTU, from 81 to 92 % (Na) and from 76 to 86 % (K). In conclusion, phytase supplementation up to a level of 15, 000 FTU/kg of a dP-deficient diet improved performance of weaner pigs and digestibility of minerals, including monovalent minerals. Up to 85 % of the phytate-P was digested.

40|$|Although {{numerous}} studies have quantified different social, economic, energetic, and environmental benefits associated with short-rotation coppice (SRC) willow plantations, comprehensive assessments of nutrient cycling are rare. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the biomass production and attendant biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulphur (S), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) during the initial four-year rotation of six willow varieties grown at four locations along a 500 km north-south pedoclimatic gradient within Saskatchewan, Canada. Nutrient budgets consisted of quantifying various nutrient inputs (e. g., atmospheric deposition and soil <b>mineral</b> weathering), <b>outputs</b> (e. g., fine and coarse root biomass, leaf biomass, harvested biomass, leaching, and denitrification), and transfers (e. g., soil organic matter mineralization, canopy exchange, leaf litter decomposition, and fine root turnover) associated with the plant available soil nutrient pool. Total above- and below-ground production during the rotation was approximately 40 Mg ha- 1, with calculated soil nutrient budget deficits (i. e., nutrient outputs > inputs + transfers) of 17, 39, 112, 271, and 74 kg ha- 1 for N, P, K, Ca, and Mg, respectively, averaged across the varieties and sites, but a soil S surplus of 60 kg ha- 1. While soil nutrient budget deficits varied among sites, there were no significant differences (P > 0. 05) among willow varieties. Despite the relatively low nutrient-demanding nature of willow and negligible leaching or denitrification losses, nutrient export in harvested biomass over multiple rotations will require soil nutrient amendments to maintain SRC willow productivity, particularly N and P, albeit a fraction of the amount required for annual agronomic crops...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Engineering Sciences (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Zirconium metal (Zr) {{is highly}} {{desirable}} as a cladding material for nuclear fuel rods in nuclear power plants, {{because of its}} very low nuclear absorption cross-section for thermal neutrons, however to use this Zr metal {{it has to be}} purified (< 100 ppm) from the contained (1 – 3 % wt) hafnium metal (Hf), occurs in zircon ore (ZrSiO 4) in nature. Because of the extensive beach deposits, rich in zircon minerals, located along the South African coasts, there is a great opportunity for zircon beneficiation in South Africa to convert the country's <b>mineral</b> <b>output</b> into high added value products rather than selling the basic mineral to countries like China. Due to the significantly similar chemical properties of these two elements, the purification of the Zr metal is a complicated process. The separation of Zr and Hf, as currently practiced, is mostly conducted through solvent extraction in which the aqueous chloride solution of metal species is contacted with an immiscible organic phase containing a reagent that selectively removes one of the two metals from the aqueous phase. The conventional multi-stage industrial approach, in production since the 1950 s, presented several technological disadvantages and environmental problems that were considered acceptable when these processes were developed, but have become a serious problem as legislation became more stringent. Thus, the main objective for this study is to develop an innovative, environmentally friendly and cost-efficient solvent-extraction process that makes use of Hf-containing Zr compounds, produced by NECSA (Pty) Ltd from zircon ore by means of plasma technology, for the separation of Zr and Hf in order to produce nuclear-grade Zr metal. Results obtained from this study show that the extraction of Zr and Hf from chloride-based compounds (Zr(Hf) CI 4) proceeds via an anion-exchange mechanism through the extraction with amine extractants (Alamine 336 and Aliquat 336), while the Zr species could be successfully recovered from the organic solutions. However, the extraction from fluoride-based compounds (K 2 Zr(Hf) F 6) was unsuccessful for both Zr and Hf species. The new proposed process for Zr and Hf separation from chloride-based Zr compounds seems to be an improvement from the conventional separation processes. Master...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{various topics}} of individual choice and welfare in economics. In the first chapter, I examine {{the choices of}} workers and business in coal mining. Coal mining is a dangerous occupation where costly fatalities and disasters may increase future accident costs. We use occurrences of deaths as shocks that affect the tradeoff between <b>mineral</b> <b>output</b> and safety. We find that government inspections and penalties increase after fatalities, and less-severe accident rates decrease by 10 %. For mines in a disaster-affected state, less-severe accident rates decrease by 23 %, and fatalities by 68 %, saving up to $ 2 per hour in accident costs, with limited evidence suggesting that mineral productivity falls by 7 %, or $ 14 per worker hour, and {{that the number of}} managers employed increases by 11 %. In the second chapter, I examine how the distribution of welfare from decades of technological improvement in electronics, have benefited consumers. To do this, I examine the welfare gains to different income cohorts from the development of multiple categories of electronic products. Income dependent preferences are estimated in a dynamic model of demand. Key utility parameters, unique to income cohort, are identified from moments created using micro-level data containing purchase and demographic information. My results suggest that the benefits from the rise of electronics products may be far more egalitarian than conventional measures of inequality. Welfare gains to consumers in the bottom third of the US income distribution average approximately $ 1, 000, while gains to the top third benefit are about $ 2, 500. This is twice as equal as related measures of consumption inequality. In the last chapter of this dissertation, I examine the influence of early random outcomes on the choices and later success of players in a major online multiplayer game. Players misattribute early random shocks to the value of an important choice. I find that players are significantly less successful in subsequent matches when making the same choice that benefited from positive shocks early on. This effect, which occurred in just a handful of initial matches, lasts over the year long career of a player, spanning hundreds of matches of the game. The setting of the game provides a rich dataset, and is also a rare empirical example of a multi-armed bandit problem...|$|E
50|$|Maryland's {{commitment}} to develop economic opportunities began in 1884 {{with the creation}} of the Bureau of Statistics and Information of the Industries of the State (Chapter 211, Acts of 1884). To guide development, government needed to know the agricultural, <b>mineral</b> and industrial <b>output</b> of the state, what commerce was moving through Maryland, and whether transportation networks functioned. In 1892, the General Assembly directed the Bureau to collect statistics on labor, particularly wages and strikes; any information about agriculture calculated to attract immigration; and data on mineral products, manufacturing, transportation, shipping, and commerce (Chapter 29, Acts of 1892). The Bureau also was to receive reports from all officers and institutions of the state, publish the information in book form, and annually revise and republish. By 1916, as the Bureau of Industrial Statistics, it reformed to become the State Board of Labor and Statistics. Its information-gathering responsibilities continued even as it reorganized into the Department of Labor and Industry in 1945. Yet, over time, that department's focus shifted toward regulating the conditions of labor.|$|R
40|$|Intensification of {{livestock}} production {{in combination with}} a decline in arable land {{has resulted in a}} discrepancy between excess load of nutrients from livestock production and the possibility to apply these nutrients in an environmental way on agricultural land. Consequently, the <b>mineral</b> input and <b>output</b> in livestock intensive regions is not balanced. The crop production systems rely on synthetic fertilizers for fertilization, whereas livestock production systems face problems in manure disposal. This dissertation aimed towards efficient use of resources by re-connecting crop and livestock production through animal manure processing. The processing results in animal manure derivatives such as liquid fraction (LF) of digestate, mineral concentrate and air scrubber water, that might have potential to be used as alternatives for synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers. The dissertation investigated N fertilizer performance of these materials with regard to crop yield and soil properties on laboratory, greenhouse and field scale. Results showed that LF of digestate, air scrubber water and mineral concentrate can be used as synthetic N fertilizer substitutes without adverse effects on crop yield. With regard to environmental aspects, it seems that these materials should not additionally increase the risk of nitrate leaching as compared to conventional fertilization practices. Some of their characteristics (e. g. form, nutrient concentration, stability) differ from the characteristics of synthetic N fertilizers, however their N performance indicates the potential of labelling LF of digestate, ASW and mineral concentrate as processed mineral fertilizers on European fertilizer market...|$|R
40|$|This work aims {{to protect}} forests in Europe from effects of air pollution, and climate change, {{and to provide}} a basis for {{sustainable}} management of forest for multiple commercial and societal values. Monitoring of forest health and forest ecosystem processes reported here for 2009 was done under the EU Life+ FutMon Project Further Development and Implementation of an EU-Level Forest Monitoring System, project number LIFE 07 ENV/D/ 000218. These studies extend a continuous series of projects at these sites since 1991, and related work begun in Ireland in 1988, of which the latest accessible report is Farrell and Boyle (2005). Reports for intervening years, 2003 – 2008 are in preparation. The monitoring procedures built on those in the previous projects and closely follow the ICP Manual (UN/ECE, 1998 and updates), while data reporting is in the formates specified by FutMon. FutMon surveys carried out in 2009, and reported here, are: visual assessment of crown condition and damaging agents; leaf-area-index measurements; air quality measurements; sampling and analysis of litterfall; sampling and analysis of deposition, and; sampling and analysis of soil-solution. The health status of the forests in Ireland is good. Level I plots were assessed between June and September 2009. The key indicator of that health status is defoliation, which has a mean value of 16 % for the Level I network of thirty-two plots assessed here. Discolouration also shows low values, with a mean value of 0. 61, averaged from values on a a scale of 0 – 4. This indicates that the central value for this survey is below 10 % of crown discolouration, within the class of least damage. Leaf-area index measurements were done using hemispheric photographs. The values represent the ratio of green-leaf area to ground area, using upper-leaf area for broadleaves, and half of total-green area for needle-leaves. Leaf Area Index is lowest (2. 11) for Brackloon, which is unmanaged, open-canopy semi-natural ancient oak, being much higher for the two productive spruce stands. The much higher values for the two spruce stands, around 6, are at the higher end of the range of LAI observed for boreal spruce forests. Air quality was assessed with Gradko passive samplers for ammonia, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and ozone (NH 3, NO 2, SO 2 and O 3). Ammonia levels were higher than in a comparable survey in 1999. Litterfall was collected, separated into fractions, and analysed for contents of nutrients and trace metals. Deposition, measured as precipitation, throughfall and stemflow, was collected and analysed weekly, and analysed for nutrient and other major elemental constituents. Soil-solution was also periodically sampled below the forest-floor organic horizon, and at two levels within the root-zone at two sites. Analysis demonstrates major elemental-turnover and redistribution processes at forest-ecosystem level, including dry-deposition onto foliage, foliar exchange, concentration by evaporation, interaction with soil organic matter, uptake by roots, effects of <b>mineral</b> weathering, and <b>outputs</b> to deep-soil water. These observations, combined with those throughout the twenty-year monitoring history, provide a basis for detecting change with external influences including major weather events, climate changes, specific deposition events, and also underpins investigation of the impact of novel management approaches, particularly whole-tree harvesting and more intensive recovery of harvest residues, as well as providing the means to assess exceedance of critical loads of acidity and of nutrient nitrogen. In combination, this monitoring provides the basis for ensuring forest health and the consequences of continued good health for forest-ecosystem services, and identifying change; for understanding the drivers of such change, including climate changes, and the effects of long-range transboundary air pollution; and for positive assessment of the effects of management decisions on sustainability...|$|R
