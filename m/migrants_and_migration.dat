40|$|Executive summary Britain’s {{national}} newspapers play {{a critical}} role in framing the country’s discourse on immigration. Developing a clearer understanding of the language that these newspapers use to discuss <b>migrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>migration</b> can therefore provide us with important insights into the nature of this debate and the role of newspapers in it. This report capitalises on new methods for analysing what is commonly known as ‘big data ’ and provides a quantitative analysis of the language used by all 20 of Britain’s main national daily and Sunday newspapers. It covers all news stories, letters and other published content dealing with <b>migrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>migration</b> over the last three years – from the beginning of 2010 to the end of 2012. This analysis has involved computer-aided analysis of a ‘corpus ’ of some 58, 000 news stories and other newspaper items, made-up of more than 43 million words, from stories which include key terms such as MIGRANTS, IMMIGRANTS, REFUGEES, ASYLUM SEEKERS or variations of those words. The study has endeavored to remove human bias from the analysis – as far as possible – by using modern computing techniques rather than human readers and coders to identify significant patterns. The analysis focuses on describing the findings rather than drawing conclusions about debates on immigration, politics or media practices. The report is not designed to highlight good or bad practice by specific news outlets or journalists, and for this reason divides the newspapers into groups rather than identifying individual newspapers...|$|E

It focuses upon the political implications of nostalgia in imagining migrant narratives of the past, arguing that this reveals more about current attitudes to <b>migrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>migration.</b> Specifically, it examines how the film 'white-washes' elements of Italian Australian history in order to reflect the ethnic group's current standing in broader Australian society, as well as the possibilities and problems this may hold for newer migrant and refugee communities in contemporary Australia. ...|$|E

40|$|Scholars of {{migration}} have {{struggled with the}} concept of security since it was first connected with migrants in the early 1990 s. The initial reaction was frequently a total rejection of any association between the two, emphasizing the usually negative effects of the security discourse on migrants.

This article examines the historical development of the security approach through the response to Algerian migrants in France over the decade from 1993 to 2003. This leads to the development of a critical security position that does not reject the security focus but combines it with a constructivist approach in an attempt to explain recent developments in attitudes to <b>migrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>migration</b> in Europe...|$|E
40|$|About the book: This book {{examines}} international labour migration, {{security and}} border-management strategies in Asia, {{in the face}} of intensified transnational economic and social processes and the expanding global governance regime.

It focuses on policy responses to <b>migrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>migration</b> processes at the border and across borders, against the backdrop of four major challenges: - The regulation of populations and cross-border movements; - Security issues; - International agreements, and - New norms of global governnance develooped by regional and international NGOs and other international organizations. The book contributes to important debates about globalisation, international migration and issues of cross-border movements. It informs public discussion and policy development on issues of security and governnace and cross-border movements in Asia. ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} ten years, two growing Romanian {{cultural}} and social phenomena made waves abroad: the films of the Romanian New Wave (RNW), and the wave of Romanian work migrants. Romanian work-migration grew in stages after the 1989 revolution and intensified after 2002 following legal and fiscal relaxation in the EU. The dynamic demographic structure of Romania {{had an impact on}} all levels of society and did not go unobserved in the newly developed Romanian New Wave cinema. Using the method of social semiotics, this paper’s aim is to analyse how films of the little-studied RNW represent the Romanian work migration from 2002 to 2011. The analysis of the films centres around the transformations occurring within the characters ’ family, home and nation, the integrity of which is challenged by the event of migration. The study is positioned within a larger theoretical framework of film genre theories of art, national and European cinemas and their role in nation building. Transmigration is used as the main theoretical lens for observing the representation of <b>migrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>migration</b> in the films. According to this framework, characters fit the portrait of the frustrated achiever wanting to reach their potential and financia...|$|E

40|$|Based on ethnographic {{fieldwork}} among Malian <b>migrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>migration</b> brokers in Mali, Algeria, Morocco, and France, {{this article}} investigates life in exile {{on the edge}} of Europe. Zooming in on the experiences of interlocutors in Morocco and Algeria, the article will explore the experiential dimensions of living in an extended liminal-ity. Anthropologically, life in so-called places of transit, such as the Maghreb countries, has often been dealt with through the lens of liminality. In this article my aim is to build on the insights from such endeavors, and reorient the focus by illumi-nating what this specific type of permanent liminality entails. I posit that a more suitable term to call this is 'limbo'. This, I argue, consists of three main features. First, the motivation for leaving Mali is for most migrants embedded in the lack of opportunities for social mobility: the Malian youth who end up leaving, are in Honwana's words, stuck in 'waithood' at home, in what many argue is a liminal social position. Second, social and political structures are not absent in the Maghreb, rather they are quite discernable and can be seen as continuations and mim-icking of existing structures. Third, experiences of dramatic ruptures with humanity and morality are key characteristics of life {{on the edge of}} Europe...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} decade of the twenty-first century, {{politics}} and everyday life in the Netherlands became polarized, under the influence of several conservative and populist movements that reflected a growing distrust of government and 'politics as usual', and a xenophobic and cultural conservative attitude towards <b>migrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>migration,</b> more specifically of Muslims and Islam. Politics took on the shape of a cultural war. This article studies the ways in which Dutch government policy tried to cope with this polarized condition by reshaping its cultural policy. The article focuses on the reorganization of the Council for Culture that advises the government on issues of culture and the arts. In a series of advisory reports the Council introduced new conceptions of citizenship in which the cultural dimension is highlighted and the role of new media and of transnational cultural developments is put forward as crucial and unavoidable. It is shown how this new cultural policy tries to do justice to the new cultural condition by covering five changes in the field of cultural policy: the shift from edification to participation; the shift from an instrumentalist to an more intrinsic definition of culture; a shift from multiculturalism to a politics of difference and experiment; the transnationalization of national politics; and the redefinition of the concept of Dutch culture...|$|E
40|$|Many {{developed}} countries have adopted policies that facilitate and regulate the immigration of highly skilled migrants as a partial remedy against short-term frictions on the labour market {{caused by an}} ageing population. Migration regulations, however, often lack the recognition that migration is a social process. This dissertation examines high-skilled migration from the life course perspective in order to acknowledge the social, cultural, and institutional contexts of migrants, {{as well as the}} dynamics in migration processes. The objective is to gain a deeper micro-level understanding of how the interdependencies of education, employment, and family trajectories shape the migration trajectories in particular, and the life courses in general of highly skilled migrants and their significant others. The key findings of this dissertation are, first, that migration is used as a pathway towards individualism and as a career strategy. Second, it is demonstrated that migration decision-making often depends on the life course stages of the linked lives of significant others. Third, the role of women as active agents in the migration process is highlighted, by showing that co-migrating female spouses do not sacrifice, but strategise their professional ambitions. Whereas high-skilled migration is often discussed and presented only in an economic context, and in terms of migrants’ financial contributions to host societies or their personal returns on investments in human capital, the findings from this qualitative study support taking a much broader perspective for a better understanding of <b>migrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>migration</b> processes...|$|E
50|$|The {{basis for}} {{the book is the}} {{complete}} genealogical network for a nomad community, its history, <b>and</b> its <b>migrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>migrations.</b> These form a relational web not just for description but for analysis of social dynamics. The picture that emerges is one of a complexly scalable social system that expands through reproduction, kinship alliances, and fissions, and overcomes internal conflicts and those with neighbors along routes of migration. These networks constitute a generative demographic engine for health, a potential for large sibling groups, and for extensive cooperation within and between these groups constructed through reciprocal ties of marriage. The book is lavishly illustrated with photos, network diagrams, and analytical tables showing how very simple principles of cohesion and scalable alliances between families are able to organize this social system through a series of shifting articulations at a variety of social and spatial levels. Thus continual reshuffling is capable of moving, and does move individuals and groups in the society through a variety of transformations in relation to life problems, social problems, technological problems, and the transmission and enrichment of a highly complex cultural system. The book shows how these adjust dynamically to changing social conditions.|$|R

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1990 s Greece, along with other European countries such as Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland, was transformed from a country of emigration to a country of immigration. Since then, the phenomenon of migration in Greece constitutes the central topic of an endless debate amongst politicians, social scientists, the public and the media, which influences the perception, and most importantly the ‘positions’ and reactions of certain individuals and groups (to an unknown extent though), and consequently the state’s control apparatus. The notions of ethnicity and migration have started to concern Greece and become intertwined with several other issues in the social sphere. Migration in Greece, as well as in other countries of the EU and generally the western, rich world, has been identified with a number of ‘social problems’. Hence, there has been a general negative discourse about <b>migrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>migration.</b> The arrival of migrants has been often compared to unstoppable weather and natural phenomena or to invading hordes, their number {{has been described as a}} ‘crisis’, and their presence in a country has been discussed within the context of problems of integration and assimilation, unemployment, national insecurity, and crime. The London bombings of 7 July 2005 and the recent riots in the suburbs of Paris and other French cities fed debates of such nature. According to a recent Eurobarometer, immigration is a major cause of concern among the citizens of the 15 old member-states of the EU...|$|E
40|$|As {{information}} service professionals, librarians {{need to keep}} abreast of the current research interests and trends. On one hand, the recent refugee crisis has brought the spotlight on <b>migrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>migration.</b> On the other hand, increased migration has led to ethnically diverse and multicultural societies problematising the monochromatic ideas of nation and culture in the process. The two together have the potential of revolutionising the {{information service}} profession, in New Zealand and across the world, in two distinct ways – 1) the need to cater {{to the demands of}} a heightened research interest in migration, migrants {{as well as in the}} related issues of host society-diaspora relationship, and expressions of this relationship in literature, institutional and societal practices, 2) the need to serve information needs of a user populace that reflects the ethnic and cultural diversity of the present day nations and institutions. This is already evident in the demands on archival services, as various migrant communities, as minority communities, seek to find out and assert their role and their place in the host nation’s and society’s history/story. At the same time, in the field of archival studies, there is an enhanced awareness of: 1) the potential role of traditional archival practices in silencing certain voices and in marginalising minorities, and 2) the need to rethink traditional archival theories and practices. As a result, community archives movement and migrant community archives are focus of increased cross-disciplinary academic attention and interest, and a cutting edge area of research. The proposed annotated bibliography will offer an online advisory tool for reference librarians, from New Zealand and in other places, helping them support research on the topic. The bibliography will be created using Zotero referencing software and made available as an online Zotero library. It will provide brief descriptions of information sources that deal with various aspects of the topic and encourage a nuanced and informed engagement with it from a New Zealand as well as global perspective...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} {{migration}} {{and the politics}} of representation in contemporary Italian cinema by comparing one of the Nigerian videos recently produced in Italy, Akpegi Boys (2009), directed by Vincent Omoigui and Simone Sandretti, with two recent Italian films which portray the experience of Nigerian migrants in Italy, Marco and Antonio Manetti’s Torino Boys (1997), and Enrico Verra’s Sotto il Sole Nero (2004). Interestingly enough both films take, implicitly and explicitly, Nigerian videos as a narrative and aesthetic reference in order to build an innovative representation of Nigerian migrants in Italy, thus positioning themselves in an original position vis-à-vis the growing corpus of Italian films about migration emerged over the past two decades. As this paper argues, these three films allow us to identify the emergence of what could be defined as an “anti-humanitarian” representation of migration. By defining their attitude as anti-humanitarian, I do not intend to mean that these films assume a negative or derogatory perspective on migration. On the contrary, what I intend to highlight is that these are films that, by using a number of specific narrative and aesthetic strategies such as, among others, the reference to Nollywood commercial and exploitation filmmaking style, make an attempt to go beyond the binary representation that much debate on migration in Italy implicitly embraces, a representation according to which the migrant is either seen as an invader or as a victim. By playing with cultural references that belong to the contemporary cultural universe of Nigerian migrants themselves, these films suggest the possibility of building a bridge between the diverging ways in which Italians and (in this case Nigerian) migrants look at migration. This encounter has the potential of helping Italian directors and intellectuals in deconstructing their hegemonic gaze on <b>migrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>migration</b> phenomena, and has the possibility to inaugurate an healthy as much as needed process of decentralization and provincialization of singularly “Italian” perspectives on migration in Italy.
