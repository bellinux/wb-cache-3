40|$|The {{physical}} {{basis for}} modeling climatic change is considered {{in connection with}} the construction of global circulation models (GCM) for simulation of the climate itself and geophysical aspects of the interaction between man and climate. A retrospective review of the basic assumptions with respect {{to the nature of the}} major course of climate behavior in the past, is given with a brief survey of paleoclimatic approaches. The main features of the two advanced numerical climate models are discussed and the role of the world oceans in maintaining the climate is considered. The author's point of view on the geophysical aspects of global climate simulation for IIASA's purposes in studying the socio-economic effect of <b>man-climate</b> <b>interactions</b> is presented...|$|E
