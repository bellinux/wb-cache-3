2500|$|These {{factors are}} likely to change over time, so the market price of a bond will vary after it is issued. The market price is {{expressed}} {{as a percentage of}} nominal value. Bonds are not necessarily issued at par (100% of face value, corresponding to a price of 100), but bond prices will move towards par as they approach maturity (if the market expects the <b>maturity</b> <b>payment</b> to be made in full and on time) as this is the price the issuer will pay to redeem the bond. This is referred to as [...] "Pull to Par". At other times, prices can be above par (bond is priced at greater than 100), which is called trading at a premium, or below par (bond is priced at less than 100), which is called trading at a discount. Most government bonds are denominated in units of $1000 in the United States, or in units of £100 in the United Kingdom. Hence, a deep discount US bond, selling at a price of 75.26, indicates a selling price of $752.60 per bond sold. (Often, in the US, bond prices are quoted in points and thirty-seconds of a point, rather than in decimal form.) [...] Some short-term bonds, such as the U.S. Treasury bill, are always issued at a discount, and pay par amount at maturity rather than paying coupons. This is called a discount bond.|$|E
50|$|Inflation risk is {{the risk}} that the value of the {{currency}} a bond pays out will decline over time. Investors expect some amount of inflation, so the risk is that the inflation rate will be higher than expected. Many governments issue inflation-indexed bonds, which protect investors against inflation risk by linking both interest <b>payments</b> and <b>maturity</b> <b>payments</b> to a consumer prices index.|$|R
50|$|The issuing company forms a Delaware trust (a Connecticut {{trust is}} also common) and holds 100% {{of the common}} stock of the trust. The trust then issues {{preferred}} stock to investors. All of the proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock are paid to the company. In exchange, the company issues junior subordinated debt to the trust with essentially the same terms as the trust's preferred stock. All steps except {{the formation of the}} trust occur simultaneously. If the issuing company is a bank holding company, it will also usually guarantee the interest and <b>maturity</b> <b>payments</b> on the trust preferred stock.|$|R
50|$|A {{term loan}} {{is simply an}} {{installment}} loan, such as a loan one would use to buy a car. The borrower may draw on the loan during a short commitment period and repay it based on either a scheduled series of repayments or a one-time lump-sum <b>payment</b> at <b>maturity</b> (bullet <b>payment).</b> There are two principal types of term loans: an amortizing term loan and an institutional term loan.|$|R
5000|$|The Court {{noted that}} this arguably was an {{administratively}} inconvenient result. It meant that one party continued to be indebted to another party, but that other party could never enforce the right to payment. Thee Court further noted that if the condition precedent was subsequently cured after <b>maturity,</b> then <b>payment</b> could still occur at that time. Ironically, under the defined terms in the agreement that would constitute [...] "early" [...] termination, although the actual termination would occur long after stated maturity.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{analyze the}} optimal design of debt <b>maturity,</b> coupon <b>payments,</b> and {{dividend}} payout restrictions under asymmetric information. They show that, if the {{asymmetry of information}} is concentrated around long-term cash flows, firms finance with coupon-bearing long-term debt that partially restricts dividend payments. If the asymmetry of information is concentrated around near-term cash flows and there exists considerable refinancing risk, firms finance with coupon-bearing long-term debt that does not restrict dividend payments. Finally, if the asymmetry of information is uniformly distributed across dates, firms finance with short-term debt. Copyright 1995 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R
40|$|We study risk-minimization {{for a large}} {{class of}} {{insurance}} contracts. Given that the individual progress in time of visiting an insurance policy’s states follows an F -doubly stochastic Markov chain, we describe different state-dependent types of insurance benefits. These cover single <b>payments</b> at <b>maturity,</b> annuity-type <b>payments</b> and payments {{at the time of}} a transition. Based on the intensity of the F -doubly stochastic Markov chain, we provide the Galtchouk-Kunita-Watanabe decomposition for a general insurance contract and specify risk-minimizing strategies in a Brownian financial market setting. The results are further illustrated explicitly within an affine structure for the intensity...|$|R
50|$|Fixed income {{products}} are generally bonds issued by various government treasuries, companies or international organizations. Bond holders are usually entitled to coupon payments at periodic intervals until <b>maturity.</b> These coupon <b>payments</b> are generally fixed amounts (quoted as {{percentage of the}} bond's face value) or the coupons could float in relation to LIBOR or another reference rate.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the major}} uses of Usance Bills is Drafts are used in {{arrangements}} where deferred payments are used.

50|$|The {{coupon rate}} {{attached}} to the fixed-rate bond is payable at specified dates before the bond reaches maturity; the coupon rate and the fixed-payments are delivered periodically to the investor at a percentage rate of the bond’s face value. Due to a fixed-rate bond’s lengthy <b>maturity</b> date, these <b>payments</b> are typically small and as stated before are not tied into interest rates.|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} is {{becoming}} increasingly important to handle credit risk. Credit risk is the risk associated {{with the possibility of}} bankruptcy. More precisely, if a derivative provides for a payment at cert time T but before that time the counterparty defaults, at <b>maturity</b> the <b>payment</b> cannot be effectively performed, so the owner of the contract loses it entirely or a part of it. It means that the payoff of the derivative, and consequently its price, depends on the underlying of the basic derivative and on the risk of bankruptcy of the counterparty. To value and to hedge credit risk in a consistent way, one needs to develop a quantitative model. We have studied analytical approximation formulas and numerical methods such as Monte Carlo method in order to calculate the price of a bond. We have illustrated how to obtain fast and accurate pricing approximations by expanding the drift and diffusion as a Taylor series and we have compared the second and third order approximation of the Bond and Call price with an accurate Monte Carlo simulation. We have analysed JDCEV model with constant or stochastic interest rate. We have provided numerical examples that illustrate the effectiveness and versatility of our methods. We have used Wolfram Mathematica and Matlab. ...|$|R

Catastrophe bond (CAT bond) {{is one of}} {{the most}} active {{instruments}} to transfer catastrophic risk into the capital market around the whole world. And the pricing theories are developed recently. For earthquake disaster, a pricing model, base on engineering seismic risk assessment, is given. The occurring probability of a defined earthquake catastrophe, estimated by seismic risk assessment method, is adopted as an input. Some factors, like yields and proportion of reinvestment, principal protected ratio, issuance fee, circulation, <b>maturity</b> period, claim <b>payments</b> of insurers and reinsurers, are designed. The cash flows of earthquake insurance premium in complete and incomplete markets are described by Geometric Brownian Motion and Jump-Diffusion processes respectively. The annual coupon rate of a CAT bond is calculated under the equilibrium between the incomes of investors and issuers. The feasibility of the model is represented by a production...|$|R
30|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of smart phones and mobile Internet, phone games become a huge entertainment market. The commercial objective of game carrier and developers (including individual developers and game companies) is to obtain profits and royalties from this emerging market. There are four major types {{of marketing and}} charging for phone games: the traditional purchase of software package still occupies a certain market, e.g., Infinity Blade; Purchase of game point cards is a new payment method which is often taken by Asian players, and the points consume according {{to the time of}} use; Payment by embedded advertisements is popular in phone games, but sometimes becomes annoying. For this kind of payoff, Cost Per Click/Mille/Action and Click Through Rate are the most important indicators on which researchers focus; In-APP purchase of game props, e.g., Fruit Ninjia, becomes attractive with the <b>maturity</b> of mobile <b>payment</b> platforms (e.g., Alipay and Paypal). In this paper, we focus on investigating the last type of trade mode and aim at increasing the conversion rate of props purchase in phone games.|$|R
40|$|Debt {{restructuring}} {{is one of}} {{the policy}} tools available for resolving sovereign debt crises and, while unorthodox, it is not uncommon. We propose a scenario analysis for debt sustainability and integrate it with scenario optimization for risk management in restructuring sovereign debt. The scenario dynamics of debt-to-GDP ratio are used to define a tail risk measure, termed conditional Debt-at-Risk. A multi-period stochastic programming model minimizes the expected cost of debt financing subject to risk limits. It provides an operational model to handle significant aspects of debt restructuring: it collects all debt issues in a common framework, and can include contingent claims, multiple currencies and step-up or linked contractual features. Alternative debt profiles – obtained by <b>maturity</b> rescheduling, interest <b>payment</b> concessions or nominal value haircuts – are analyzed for their expected cost-risk tradeoffs. With a suitable re-calculation of the efficient frontier, the risk of debt un-sustainability of alternative risk profiles can be ascertained with a given confidence level. The model is applied to Greece sovereign debt crisis analyzing the suitability of various proposals to restore debt sustainability...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroducing a {{surrender}} option in unit-linked life insurance contracts {{leads to a}} dependence between the surrender time and the financial market. [J. Barbarin, Risk minimizing strategies for life insurance contracts with {{surrender option}}, Tech. rep., University of Louvain-La-Neuve, 2007] used a lot of concepts from credit risk to describe the surrender {{time in order to}} hedge such types of contracts. The basic assumption made by Barbarin is that the surrender time is not a stopping time with respect to the financial market. The goal {{of this article is to}} make the hedging strategies more explicit by introducing concrete processes for the risky asset and by restricting the hazard process to an absolutely continuous process. First, we assume that the risky asset follows a geometric Brownian motion. This extends the theory of [T. Møller, Risk-minimizing hedging strategies for insurance payment processes, Finance and Stochastics 5 (2001) 419 – 446], in that the random times of payment are not independent of the financial market. Second, the risky asset follows a Lévy process. For both cases, we assume the payment process contains a continuous payment stream until surrender or <b>maturity</b> and a <b>payment</b> at surrender or at maturity, whichever comes first...|$|R
40|$|Resumé The {{concept of}} bill of {{exchange}} and promissory note The purpose of the thesis is to describe institutes of {{bill of exchange}} and promissory note and other important institutes of law related to the bill of exchange. The thesis is separated into several parts, in the first chapter I use general characteristic of negotiable instruments for the bill of exchange. In the second chapter I briefly discuss relations {{of the bill of}} exchange, because we have to pay attention not only to the essentials but also to other terms of drawing the bill. In the third chapter I deal with the bill of exchange and promissory note and their essentials. The difference between the bill of exchange and the promissory note is an unconditional order to pay a determinate sum of money by drawer to drawee, which is characteristic for the bill of exchange; whereas the promissory note is characterized by an unconditional promise to pay a determinate sum of money by drawer. The rest of essentials, except for the name of drawee logically, are the same. These essential are the term "bill of exchange" incorporated {{in the body of the}} bill of exchange in the same language as a text of the bill of exchange, <b>maturity,</b> place of <b>payment,</b> name of payee, place and date of drawing a bill of exchange and signature of drawer.
