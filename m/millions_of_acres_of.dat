In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt designated <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> forest lands for protection, including what became Siskiyou National Forest, which surrounds the cave. The USFS was created in 1905 to manage these reserves. Three years later, Congress passed the Antiquities Act, which allowed the President to designate protected areas called National Monuments on public lands. In 1909, President William Howard Taft established Oregon Caves National Monument, to be managed by the USFS. A year later the USFS employed men to guard the cave and to serve as tour guides.|$|E
5|$|In late 1818, Jennings was {{appointed}} {{as a federal}} commissioner, along with Lewis Cass and Benjamin Parke, to negotiate a treaty with the Native Americans (Potawatomi, Wea, Miami, and Delaware), {{who lived in the}} northern and central parts of Indiana.

The appointment created a crisis in Jennings's political career. Because the state constitution prohibited a person from holding a federal government position while exercising duties as the state's governor, Jennings's political enemies seized the opportunity to force him from office by arguing that he had vacated the governor's office when he accepted the federal appointment.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{resistance}} management is to slow and ideally reverse the development {{of resistance}} in the pest population. Since 1996, <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> crops have been planted that are genetically engineered with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for insect resistance. The novelty for resistance management is that with Bt technology {{it is possible to}} control the principal force in an agroecosystem microevolutionary process from the outset, i. e., selection pressure. In Bt crops, the toxin can be expressed constitutively at a relatively constant dose or expression of the toxin can be restricted to specific crop stages, tissues, or both. Here we propose that more precise control of selection eases the practical application of resistance management strategies (high-dose–refugia) compared to other resistance strategies. The population genetics and ecological and operational factors related to the high-dose–refugia strategy currently used for Bt crops are also reviewed...|$|R

5|$|Lincoln {{adhered to}} the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary {{responsibility}} for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction. He signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support {{for the construction of}} the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869.

On this fresh, sweet summer morning, with the sun bright and warm, presaging a hot and glorious day, Lenore wanted to run with the winds, to wade through the alfalfa, to watch with strange and renewed pleasure the waves of shadow as they went over the wheat. All her life she had known and loved the fields of waving gold. But {{they had never been}} to her what they had become overnight. Perhaps this was because it had been said that the issue of the great war, the salvation of the world, and its happiness, its hope, depended upon the <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> broad <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> golden grain. Bread was the staff of life. Lenore felt that she was changing and growing. If anything should happen to her brother Jim she would be heiress to thousands <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> wheat.

President Coolidge appointed Hoover to coordinate the response to the flood. Hoover personally crisscrossed the Mississippi Valley, giving speeches and coordinating the response. He established over one hundred tent cities and a fleet of more than six hundred vessels, and raised $17 million. In large part due to his leadership during the flood crisis, by 1928, Hoover had begun to overshadow President Coolidge himself.|$|R

These artists avoided gritty realism and created positive images of an idealized, strong, capable America, a viewpoint which accorded well with the political environment of the New Deal and was in some senses therapeutic for the anxiety and weakness pervasive during and just after the Depression. Typical of this was Benton's Plowing It Under, released shortly after the federal government arranged the plowing under <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> previously devoted to cotton production in order to increase farm revenue; Benton's work reassured the public that the government was working {{in the best interests of}} the people.|$|R

25|$|Economic {{inequality}} {{seems to}} be related to the influence of inherited social-economic stratification. A 1995 study notes that the caste system in India is a system of exploitation of poor low-ranking groups by more prosperous high-ranking groups. A report published in 2001 note that in India 36.3% of people own no land at all, 60.6% own about 15% of the land, with a very wealthy 3.1% owning 15% of the land. A study by Haque reports that India contains both the largest number of rural poor, and the largest number of landless households on the planet. Haque also reports that over 90 percent of both scheduled castes (low-ranking groups) and all other castes (high-ranking groups) either do not own land or own land area capable of producing less than $1000 per year of food and income per household. However, over 99 percent of India's farms are less than 10 hectares, and 99.9 percent of the farms are less than 20 hectares, regardless of the farmer or landowner's caste. Indian government has, in addition, vigorously pursued agricultural land ceiling laws which prohibit anyone from owning land greater than mandated limits. India has used this law to forcibly acquire land from some, then redistribute tens <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> to the landless and poor of the low-caste. Haque suggests that Indian lawmakers need to reform and modernise the nation's land laws and rely less on blind adherence to land ceilings and tenancy reform.|$|R
40|$|How {{much land}} will PV need to supply our electricity? If {{photovoltaics}} were a primary energy source, {{what would the}} world look like? Would PV collectors cover {{every square inch of}} available land? Contrary to popular opinion, a world relying on PV would offer a landscape almost indistinguishable from the landscape we know today. The impact of PV on the landscape would be low for three reasons. First, PV systems have siting advantages over other technologies; for example, PV can be put on roofs. Second, even ground-mounted PV collectors are efficient from the perspective of land use. Third, adequate sunlight is ubiquitous and present in predictable amounts almost every w h e re. As we move away from fossil-fuel energy, PV use will be crucial because of its land-use advantages. PV’s Low-Impact Siting for Flat-Plate Systems In the United States, cities and residences cover about 140 <b>million</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> land. We could supply every kilowatt-hour of our nation’s current electricity requirements simply by applying PV to 7 % of this area—on roofs, on parking lots, along highway walls, on the sides of buildings, and in other dual-use scenarios. We wouldn’t have to appropriate a single <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> new land to make PV our primary energy source! PV’s Efficient Ratio of Produced Energy to Land Use Even if it isn’t installed on rooftops, flat-plate PV technology is the most land-efficient means to produce renewable energ y. As the table to the right shows, PV has a competitive convert e r efficiency, a high capacity factor, and can be “packed” densely in a given area. Rooftop PV is practical in urban areas with high land costs. PV graces a rooftop in Brisbane, Australia. One way to understand land-use issues for different energy sources is to realize that the federal government idles 30 <b>million</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> farmland every year—or three times the area needed to generate all our electricity from sunlight. We also set aside 23 <b>million</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> land for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which is more than twice the acreage needed to generate all our electricity with PV. Furthermore, we set aside hundreds <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> for rangeland, military bases, airports, and rights-of-way for fossil fuel pipelines, drilling, and reserves every year...|$|R

The formula used by Boldt gave the tribes forty-three percent (43%) of the Puget Sound harvest, which was equivalent to eighteen percent (18%) of the statewide harvest.
