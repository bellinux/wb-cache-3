5|$|Exercise also {{increases}} the respiratory rate, partly {{in response to}} the movement of the limbs detected by proprioceptors in the <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> joints, an increase in body temperature, the release of adrenaline (epinephrine) from the adrenal glands, and from motor impulses originating from the cerebral cortex.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these physiological processes, the body possesses a number of compensatory mechanisms to maintain function {{in the presence of}} residual paralysis. These include the use of weaker muscles at a higher than usual intensity relative to the muscle's maximal capacity, enhancing athletic development of previously little-used <b>muscles,</b> <b>and</b> using ligaments for stability, which enables greater mobility.|$|E
5|$|Like most arthropods, spiders lack {{balance and}} {{acceleration}} sensors {{and rely on}} their eyes to tell them which way is up. Arthropods' proprioceptors, sensors that report the force exerted by <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> the degree of bending {{in the body and}} joints, are well understood.

Particular interests include the basic biology of satellite <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> stem cells, excitation-contraction coupling, <b>muscle</b> metabolism <b>and</b> adaptation of <b>muscle</b> to exercise. The programs address a need for translational research to develop discoveries that enhance treatment and improve management of <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> musculoskeletal diseases and disorders.

5|$|Like others storks, {{it lacks}} vocal <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> {{produces}} sound mainly by bill-clattering, although low grunting, mooing or roaring sounds are made especially when nesting. The bill-clattering display {{is made with}} the bill raised high and {{differs from that of}} the closely related African marabou which holds the bill pointed downwards.|$|E
5|$|Other {{proteins}} that serve structural functions are motor proteins such as myosin, kinesin, and dynein, which {{are capable of}} generating mechanical forces. These proteins are crucial for cellular motility of single celled organisms and the sperm of many multicellular organisms which reproduce sexually. They also generate the forces exerted by contracting <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> play essential roles in intracellular transport.|$|E
5|$|The {{anatomy of}} the <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> {{skeleton}} is described in the Hippocratic Corpus, an Ancient Greek medical work written by unknown authors. Aristotle described vertebrate anatomy based on animal dissection. Praxagoras identified the difference between arteries and veins. Also in the 4th century BCE, Herophilos and Erasistratus produced more accurate anatomical descriptions based on vivisection of criminals in Alexandria during the Ptolemaic dynasty.|$|E
50|$|Myopodin protein, {{also called}} Synaptopodin-2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SYNPO2 gene. Myopodin is {{expressed}} in cardiac, smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> skeletal <b>muscle,</b> <b>and</b> localizes to Z-disc structures.|$|R
40|$|Yearling common barbel (Barbus barbus L.) {{were fed}} four {{purified}} casein-based diets for 6 weeks in outdoor cages. Besides control diet, these were supplemented with 0. 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 dw selenium (Se) from sodium selenite, or 0. 3 and 1. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 from Se-enriched microalgae biomass (Chlorella), a previously untested Se source for fish. Fish mortality, growth, Se accumulation in <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> liver, and activity of selected enzymes in blood plasma, <b>muscle,</b> liver, <b>and</b> intestine were evaluated. There was no mortality, and {{no differences in}} fish growth, among groups. Se concentrations in <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> liver, activity of alanine aminotransferase and creatine kinase in blood plasma, glutathione reductase (GR) in <b>muscle,</b> <b>and</b> GR <b>and</b> catalase in <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> liver suggested that selenium from Se-enriched Chlorella is more readily accumulated and biologically active while being less toxic than sodium selenite...|$|R
50|$|The {{obturator}} vessels lie {{between the}} <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> the obturator membrane; the anterior {{branch of the}} obturator nerve reaches the thigh by passing {{in front of the}} <b>muscle,</b> <b>and</b> the posterior branch by piercing it.|$|R
5|$|The upper {{esophagus}} lies at {{the back}} of the mediastinum behind the trachea, adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe, and in front of the erector spinae <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> the vertebral column. The lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta. From the bifurcation of the trachea downwards, the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left atrium. At this point it passes through the diaphragm.|$|E
5|$|Unlike bony fish, sharks have {{a complex}} dermal corset made of {{flexible}} collagenous fibers and arranged as a helical network surrounding their body. This {{works as an}} outer skeleton, providing attachment for their swimming <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> thus saving energy. Their dermal teeth give them hydrodynamic advantages as they reduce turbulence when swimming.|$|E
5|$|Bees {{beat their}} wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not {{contract}} on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second. These types of muscles are called asynchronous <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> {{are found in}} the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera. Bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures. Bumblebees have been known to reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30°C (86°F) using this method.|$|E
40|$|It remains incompletely {{understood}} {{whether there}} is an association between the transcriptome profiles of skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> blood leukocytes in response to exercise or other physiological stressors. We have previously analyzed the changes in the <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> blood neutrophil transcriptome in eight trained men before and 3 h, 48 h and 96 h after 2 h cycling and running. Because we collected <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> blood in the same individuals and under the same conditions, we were able to directly compare gene expression between the <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> blood neutrophils. Applying weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) as an advanced network-driven method to these original datasets enabled us to compare the <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> neutrophil transcriptomes in a rigorous and systematic manner. Two gene networks were identified that were preserved between skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> blood neutrophils, functionally related to mitochondria and post-translational processes. Strong preservation measures (Zsummary > 10) for both muscle-neutrophil gene networks were evident within the post-exercise recovery period. <b>Muscle</b> <b>and</b> neutrophil gene co-expression was strongly correlated in the mitochondria-related network (r = 0. 97; p = 3. 17 E- 2). We also identified multiple correlations between muscular gene sub-networks and exercise-induced changes in blood leukocyte counts, inflammation <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> damage markers. These data reveal previously unidentified gene co-expression between skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> blood neutrophils following exercise, showing the value of WGCNA to understand exercise physiology. Furthermore, these findings provide preliminary evidence in support of the notion that blood neutrophil gene networks may potentially help us to track physiological and pathophysiological changes in the muscle...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about {{interactions}} between <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> bone during the removal and application of mechanical signals. Here, we applied 3 wk of hindlimb unloading followed by 3 wk of reambulation to a genetically heterogeneous population of 352 adult mice and tested the hypothesis that changes in muscle are associated with changes in bone {{at the level of}} the tissue and the genome. During unloading and relative to normally ambulating control mice, most mice lost <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> cortical bone with large variability across the population. During reambulation, individual mice regained bone <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> at different rates. Across mice, changes in <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> trabecular/cortical bone were not correlated to each other during unloading or reambulation. For unloading, we found one significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for <b>muscle</b> area <b>and</b> five QTLs for cortical bone without overlap between mechano-sensitive <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> cortical bone QTLs (but some overlap between <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> trabecular QTLs). The low correlations between morphological changes in <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> bone, together with the largely distinct genetic regulation of the response indicate that the premise of a muscle-bone unit that co-adjusts its size during (un) loading may need to be reassessed. © 2016, International Society of Musculoskeletal and Neuronal Interactions.

5|$|CGI {{special effects}} {{for the series}} were {{provided}} by The Mill. The production team wanted a talking dragon, but {{they were worried about}} the lip sync and did not think it would be believable until they saw the first test. The Mill created a software that would read Hurt's facial <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> incorporated it into the animation. Another concern was that the eyes would not convey the character, but this was corrected by the final version. Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight. The knife Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting the chair was real.|$|E
5|$|Flies {{are capable}} of great {{manoeuvrability}} during flight due {{to the presence of}} the halteres. These act as gyroscopic organs and are rapidly oscillated in time with the wings; they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the wing-steering <b>muscles,</b> <b>and</b> flies deprived of their halteres are unable to fly. The wings and halteres move in synchrony but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent, allowing the fly to turn sideways. The wings of the fly are attached to two kinds of muscles, those used to power it and another set used for fine control.|$|E

5|$|In many species, the molars are {{relatively}} large, intricately structured, and highly cusped or ridged. Rodent molars are well equipped to grind food into small particles. The jaw musculature is strong. The lower jaw is thrust forward while gnawing and is pulled backwards during chewing. Rodent groups {{differ in the}} arrangement of the jaw <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> associated skull structures, both from other mammals and amongst themselves. The Sciuromorpha, such as the eastern grey squirrel, have a large deep masseter, making them efficient at biting with the incisors. The Myomorpha, such as the brown rat, have enlarged temporalis muscles, making them able to chew powerfully with their molars. The Hystricomorpha, such as the guinea pig, have larger superficial masseter <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> smaller deep masseter muscles than rats or squirrels, possibly making them less efficient at biting with the incisors, but their enlarged internal pterygoid muscles may allow them to move the jaw further sideways when chewing. The cheek pouch is a specific morphological feature used for storing food and is evident in particular subgroups of rodents like kangaroo rats, hamsters, chipmunks and gophers which have two bags that may range from the mouth {{to the front of the}} shoulders. True mice and rats do not contain this structure but their cheeks are elastic due to a high degree of musculature and innervation in the region.|$|E

The drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published would undoubtedly have made a major contribution to medical science.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this, {{finding that}} large <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> {{cartilage}} would have limited {{movement of the}} neck. They state the feeding ranges for sauropods like Diplodocus were smaller than previously believed, and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. The conclusions of Cobley etal. are disputed by Taylor, who analyzed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine {{the flexibility of the}} neck of Apatosaurus and Diplodocus. He found that the neck of Apatosaurus was very flexible.|$|E
