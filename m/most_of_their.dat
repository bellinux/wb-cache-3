5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed over <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> area forming the wing membrane.

Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
