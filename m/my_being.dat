500|$|The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's {{first win}} in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. It remains {{the only time that}} the United States has not won the men's event.

500|$|The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's {{first ever}} {{win in a}} medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women, and it still remains {{the only time that}} the United States did not win the men's event. After the race, the team made a celebratory dive into the water and {{performed}} a poolside interview. Tonelli remarked that [...] "I was totally stunned. After all the hassle, and <b>my</b> <b>being</b> the athletes' mouthpiece, we'd come through and done it". Australia's women's captain Lisa Forrest hailed the win as [...] "a gold medal that should never have been". Evans said of the relay, [...] "It was unbelievable, but it was all so logical. I was so deliriously happy that I couldn't stop talking," [...] as Brooks dedicated his win to his mother, who had died from cancer the previous Christmas.|$|E
500|$|From October to December 1953 Formby {{appeared}} at the London Palladium in 138performances of the revue Fun and the Fair, with Terry-Thomas and the Billy Cotton band; Formby appeared in the penultimate act of the evening, with Terry-Thomas closing the show. Although Formby's act was well-received, the show was not as successful as had been hoped, and Terry-Thomas later wrote that [...] "Formby put the audience in a certain mood which made them non-receptive to whoever followed... Even though my act was the star spot, I felt on this occasion that <b>my</b> <b>being</b> there was an anti-climax". He requested that the order be changed to have Formby close the show, but this was turned down. Formby suffered from stage fright during the show's run—the {{first time he had}} suffered from the condition since his earliest days on stage—and his bouts of depression returned, along with stomach problems.|$|E
500|$|Kerry led off in {{a faster}} time than he had clocked in the {{individual}} event, {{but it was still}} two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87s. This left Australia in fourth place {{at the end of the}} first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, leaving Australia almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Tonelli then swam the butterfly leg in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster his previous best over the distance. He did so with an uneven arm technique due to the unequal strength in his arms. Tonelli's butterfly leg would have been good enough for a silver medal if he had replicated it in the individual event. He began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre of his Soviet opponent by the end of his leg. Brooks then executed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. By the 50m mark, he had drawn level and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler pulled level at the 25m mark before Brooks sprinted away again to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. He had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his teammates. The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. After the win, Tonelli said [...] "I was totally stunned. After all the hassle, and <b>my</b> <b>being</b> the athletes' mouthpiece, we'd come through and done it." [...] In 2000, Tonelli and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the Australian Sports Medal for their victory in Moscow.|$|E

I thus understand that, in itself, error is a lack, rather than a real thing dependent on God. Hence, I understand that I can err without God's having given me a special ability to do so. Rather, I fall into error because my God-given ability to judge the truth is not infinite. [...] (Descartes, Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity).|$|E
