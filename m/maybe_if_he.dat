60|$|But I don't {{think it}} was wise or judicious {{on the part of}} Mr. Choate to show this higher {{education}} he has obtained. He sat in the lap of that great education (I was there at the time), and see the result--the lamentable result. <b>Maybe</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had had a sandwich here to sustain him the result would not have been so serious.|$|E

6000|$|... "Listen," [...] Sheldon said to them. [...] "This man and me, we {{have one}} big fight to-day. Maybe he die. <b>Maybe</b> I die. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> die, all right. If I die, you two look after Missie Lackalanna. You take rifles, and you look after her daytime and night-time. If she {{want to talk with}} Mr. Tudor, all right. If she not want to talk, you make him keep away. Savvee?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Jerry Stratton {{wrote of}} Songs of the Doomed on the Mimsy Book Review site: The {{subtitle}} is “More Notes on the Death of the American Dream”. <b>Maybe</b> <b>if</b> it’s dead <b>he</b> can stop loading up on dangerous drugs {{and going out}} looking for it, settle down and raise a nice family in Woody Creek? Fat chance, though he certainly has tamed since his Fear and Loathing days... The more things change, the more they stay the same. Some things here are duplicates of articles in other books, {{but this is a}} return to style of Thompson, and well recommended.|$|R
60|$|But {{she made}} no sign. A husband who steps around the corner for twenty years and then drops in again should not expect to find his {{slippers}} laid out too conveniently near nor a match ready lighted for his cigar. There must be expiation, explanation, and possibly execration. A little purgatory, and then, <b>maybe,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were properly humble, he might be trusted with a harp and crown. And so {{she made no}} sign that she knew or suspected.|$|E
60|$|WELL, Tom got up {{one thing}} after another, {{but they all}} had tender spots about 'em somewheres, {{and he had to}} shove 'em aside. So at last he was about in despair. Then the St. Louis papers begun to talk a good deal about the balloon that was going to sail to Europe, and Tom sort of thought he wanted to go down and see what it looked like, but couldn't make up his mind. But the papers went on talking, and so he allowed that <b>maybe</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't go he mightn't ever have another chance to see a balloon; and next, he found out that Nat Parsons was going down to see it, and that decided him, of course. He wasn't going to have Nat Parsons coming back bragging about seeing the balloon, and him having to listen to it and keep quiet. So he wanted me and Jim to go too, and we went.|$|E
60|$|A certain fear of death, {{dull and}} oppressive, came to him. This fear quickly became poignant as he {{realized}} that it was no longer a mere matter of freezing his fingers and toes, or of losing his hands and feet, but that {{it was a matter of}} life and death with the chances against him. This threw him into a panic, and he turned and ran up the creek-bed along the old, dim trail. The dog joined in behind and kept up with him. He ran blindly, without intention, in fear such as he had never known in his life. Slowly, as he ploughed and floundered through the snow, he began to see things again—the banks of the creek, the old timber-jams, the leafless aspens, and the sky. The running made him feel better. He did not shiver. <b>Maybe,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> ran on, his feet would thaw out; and, anyway, if he ran far enough, he would reach camp and the boys. Without doubt he would lose some fingers and toes and some of his face; but the boys would take care of him, and save the rest of him when he got there. And at the same time there was another thought in his mind that said he would never get to the camp and the boys; that it was too many miles away, that the freezing had too great a start on him, and that he would soon be stiff and dead. This thought he kept in the background and refused to consider. Sometimes it pushed itself forward and demanded to be heard, but he thrust it back and strove to think of other things.|$|E
50|$|Viral {{replication}} is cytoplasmic. Entry {{into the}} host cell {{is achieved by}} attachment of the viral S protein (<b>maybe</b> also <b>HE</b> <b>if</b> present) to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive-stranded RNA-virus transcription, using the premature termination model of subgenomic RNA transcription is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by -1 ribosomal frameshifting. Human, cattle, pig, and horse serve as the natural host. Transmission {{is thought to be}} via the faecal-oral route.|$|R

50|$|In 1984, Chris Van Allsburg visited Wenders' office, and Wenders {{showed him}} Burdick's drawings. Van Allsburg decided that <b>maybe</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{published}} the drawings, {{they may find}} out who Harris Burdick was.|$|E
5000|$|A {{section of}} people {{believed}} that <b>maybe</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was ruler, then Antar {{would have been}} a better world. However, this isn't really confirmed by other canon sources, and this theory came only from the voice of the character Courtney, who was a self-proclaimed [...] "Michael-worshipper".|$|E
50|$|When {{the experts}} {{interview}} the contestants, the experts question Tab on her nerves, Ben on his relationship, Jon on humility, and Shirley on confidence. Lauri, {{who has seen}} past seasons on the show, is quietly confident; while Sly admits to confidence issues. Afiya is ignorant as to why she was nominated, while Aaron breaks down when talking to the experts. He admits that <b>maybe</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> can share his pain to the world, {{he will be able}} to recover. Since it is the end of the first episode, no one is leaving, and the lessons will begin in earnest.|$|E
5000|$|The {{film from}} this point on begins to reach a surreal climax, as the soldiers' days of leisure and peace {{threaten}} to undermine the very reality of the war itself. A recurring theme throughout their escapades is the very idea of eternal recurrence itself, as one soldier drunkenly ponders out loud <b>if</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he's</b> [...] "been here before". Although the men are eager to sit out the war that they feel will soon end, the experienced Major Falconer predicts that Germans will attack the thin American positions in the Ardennes and that the castle is a strategic point in the Germans advance towards the crossroads of Bastogne. The Major's theories are confirmed when he sees German star shell signals and successfully ambushes a German reconnaissance patrol led by a German officer who was once billeted in the castle and was a lover of the Countess as well.|$|R

5000|$|The man {{who would}} later be known as Último Dragoncito was born on August 8, 1972 in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. At {{the age of seven}} he became a big fan of Lucha libre, or {{professional}} wrestling, especially the enmascarado, or masked wrestler, known as Gallo Tapado ("The Hooded Rooster") who was a Guadalajara regular. Later on he began going to the gym to get in shape before approaching Diablo Velasco to possibly train him.Velasco turned him down, stating he was simply too short to be a luchador, standing at only [...] at the time. He suggested that <b>maybe</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> learned Olympic style wrestling he may have a chance. He began training with Cesar and Apolo Dantés, learning the wrestling basics and trained for with them for several years before actually being taught Lucha Libre.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II, {{the owners of the}} Spanish and Indian Trading Company decided to switch to war-related opportunities, and in 1943 the company closed down, putting McKibbin out of a job. Then in March 1943, she was approached by three men from California seeking to establish a new office in Santa Fe, who offered to hire her as a secretary. She was particularly impressed by one of them. She later wrote: I thought to be associated with that person, whoever he was, would be simply great! I never met a person with a magnetism that hit you so fast and so completely as his did. I didn't know what he did. I thought <b>maybe</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were digging trenches to put in a new road, I would love to do that, or if he were soliciting ads for a magazine or something, I would love to do that. I just wanted to be allied and {{have something to do with}} a person of such vitality and radiant force.|$|E
5000|$|Daniel's {{persistence}} in disputing his wife's intoxication and denying his wife's drug use has been condemned by {{relatives of the}} three TrailBlazer victims. When Schuler appeared on CNN's Larry King Live to demand more testing of his wife's remains, Longo's brother Joseph {{issued a statement saying}} in part, [...] "I want Daniel Schuler to know that he keeps inflicting more pain on all concerned once again by going to the media to try to paint a picture of a perfect wife and mother." [...] Bastardi's daughters appeared with their lawyer on NBC's Today, during which they questioned Daniel's culpability in enabling his wife's substance abuse and called for him to undergo drug testing himself. [...] "It makes me angry that he keeps denying it," [...] said Margaret Nicotina, Bastardi's daughter. [...] "Every time he does it, he brings it back for us. I just wish that he would just admit that she was drunk. <b>Maybe</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knows what happened that morning, if they argued or anything, that would be the truth. He wants the truth. So do we." [...] Their lawyer called Daniel's position totally outrageous, an insult to the intelligence of the American public, and a hoax. Ruskin said on The Oprah Winfrey Show in October 2009 that Daniel had avoided media appearances since Larry King Live out of respect to the Bastardi family.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] says I, [...] "maybe <b>he</b> is; but, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is, I 'm mistaken {{the worst}} sort.

5000|$|Regarding the album's lo-fi aesthetic, Vile noted, [...] "album has {{songs that}} <b>maybe</b> <b>if</b> you don't {{normally}} {{listen to that}} stuff, you'd think were a bit throwaway because of the recording quality." ...|$|R
40|$|Robert Mabro {{has always}} been a realist. <b>Maybe,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been brought up in Beirut rather than Alexandria, {{he would have been a}} cynic. Anyway, by 1969 he was, via SOAS, an {{economist}} in Oxford, at St Antonyâs. The later 1960 s and the 1970 s were, of course, the years in which OPEC was at its peak of influence and energy, in its various manifestations, was at the forefront of public awareness. For an economist who happened to be fluent in English, French, and Arabic, energy was an obvious interest to cultivate. This happened also to be the period in which Shell was developing, under Pierre Wack, its scenario planning. In 1973 the company was in the position of needing to develop a better understanding of the thinking, aspirations, and motivations of oil producers, particularly those of the Arabian Gulf â while Mabro lacked any real understanding of the oil companies and their objectives. So, in 1973, Shell Planning arranged for Mabro to join them for a year and both parties benefited greatly...|$|E
40|$|Undergraduate final project {{submitted}} to Professor Thomas A. Castillo of the History Department, College of Arts and Humanities for a course {{sponsored by the}} Center for the New America, University of Maryland, College Park. Final project for HIST 428 N Immigrant Life Stories: An Oral History Practicum (spring 2014). After {{looking back at the}} interview, I see some themes that could probably be explored more on a follow up interview. Mr. Lastarria places a lot of importance on education. He did not succumbed to the ideas of the senderistas or corrupt officers and politicians because he was well educated. It is demonstrated during the first couple of minutes in the interview when he spoke about his mother and the importance and sacrifices she did in order for her children to get an education. My uncle became an attorney, my dad an undercover agent, and my other uncles and aunts obtained blue collar jobs. 	Another major theme in this interview is family. The decisions that Mr. Lastarria made were {{for the sake of his}} family. He may have taken his job to heart, which is noted during his long absence from his family, but there is also a sense of regret on his part. As he stated during the last minutes of the interview, he wished that he would’ve enjoyed his family more. Who knows, <b>maybe</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had, the problems that are now facing my family would have gone away. My own personal view of his may have been different from what it is today. After this interview it did change a little; however, it is going to take a lot more time to mend the gap that 17 years of absence has caused. 	Corruption in the government is another theme that could definitely be explored further on another interview. Due to our limitations to an hour and a half, I could not fully explore the corruption within the Peruvian government. I realize that the goal of this interview was to get a narrative of the interviewee’s journey to the US, but events like corruption and distrust in the government play key role for certain individuals to come to the US...|$|E

5000|$|In a December 2011 interview, Canada's {{new foreign}} affairs {{minister}} John Baird attributed {{the failure to}} win a seat to principled positions taken by Canada on certain international issues: “Maybe if we had shut up, and not talked about gay rights in Africa; <b>maybe</b> <b>if</b> we had shut up and been more quiet about our concerns about Sri Lanka; <b>maybe</b> <b>if</b> we hadn't been so vocally against the deplorable human rights record in Iran, maybe Iran might have voted for us.... But we didn't and I don't think we regret anything. Iran probably voted against us; North Korea probably voted against us; Gadhafi probably voted against us.

To such an address as this it was impossible that she should reply a word.
