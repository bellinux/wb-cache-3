40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report the heavy mineral content of Miocene to Pleistocene {{sequences}} drilled during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 174 A on the New Jersey Shelf. Sandy intervals recovered from Holes 1071 A, 1071 F, 1072 A, and 1073 A were sampled for heavy mineral analysis. Because of the low core recovery of the sandy parts of the succession, sampling has been incomplete. In spite of the resulting restriction and because of major variations in heavy mineral assemblages, eight distinct heavy <b>mineral</b> <b>associations</b> could be defined. The data presented thus considerably extend the present knowledge on the lithology of the stratigraphic record as described by Austin, Christie-Blick, Malone, et al. (1998). In this chapter the heavy <b>mineral</b> <b>associations</b> and their assignment to particular sequences are described...|$|R
30|$|The {{volcanic}} ash of the eruption on September 27, 2014 at Ontake volcano consists mostly of altered rock fragments. The ash contains partly altered volcanic rock fragments consisting of primary igneous minerals (plagioclase, orthopyroxene, titanomagnetite, and feldspars) and volcanic glass accompanied by alteration minerals to some extents, and contains no juvenile fragments. These features {{indicate that the}} eruption was a non-juvenile hydrothermal eruption that {{was derived from the}} hydrothermal system developed under the crater. The major minerals derived from hydrothermal alteration zones are silica mineral, kaolin-group mineral, smectite, pyrophyllite, muscovite, alunite, anhydrite, gypsum, pyrite, K-feldspar, albite, and rutile. Minor chlorite, biotite, and garnet are accompanied. Five types of alteration <b>mineral</b> <b>associations</b> are identified from observations on individual ash particles: silica–pyrite, silica–pyrite ± alunite ± kaolin, silica–pyrophyllite–pyrite, silica–muscovite ± chlorite, and silica–K-feldspar ± albite ± garnet ± biotite. The associations indicate development of advanced argillic, sericite, and potassic alteration zones under the crater. Occurrence of anhydrite veinlet and the set of alteration zones indicate hydrothermal alteration zones similar to late-stage porphyry copper systems. Comparing the <b>mineral</b> <b>associations</b> with the geologic model of the late-stage porphyry copper systems, the source depths of <b>mineral</b> <b>associations</b> are estimated to range from near surface to > 2  km. The depths of advanced argillic alteration, sericite, and potassic zones are 0 to ~ 2, ~ 1.5 to ~ 2, and > 2  km, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Mt. Riiser-Larsen in Enderby Land, {{which is}} a part of the Napier Complex in the East Antarctic Shield, is {{underlain}} by the Archean granulites formed under the pyroxene granulite-facies condition. Characteristic <b>mineral</b> <b>associations</b> of sapphirine+quartz, orthopyroxene+sillimanite+quartz and garnet+sillimanite+quartz, all of which are breakdown products after cordierite, have coexisted stably at the peak of metamorphism. The variety of these <b>mineral</b> <b>associations</b> would be largely attributed to the chemical compositions of the rocks, namely the Mg/Fe ratio. On the basis of the phase relations determined experimentally and/or theoretically, and with the use of geothermometers and geobarometers, the P-T conditions at the peak of metamorphism are estimated to have been around 900 ℃, 8 - 10 kbars. On the other hand, P_ must have been considerably lower than P_, which is suggested by the absence of migmatitic facies and hydrous phases in the mineral assemblages...|$|R

It occurs as miarolytic cavity fillings of alkalic pegmatites in the Kola occurrence and in nepheline syenite in the Magnet Cove igneous complex of Arkansas, US. Its <b>mineral</b> <b>association</b> includes cafetite (which with it is also polymorphous), perovskite, titanite, rutile and ilmenite.|$|E
50|$|In hand specimen, pyrope is {{very tricky}} to {{distinguish}} from almandine, {{however it is}} likely to display fewer flaws and inclusions. Other distinguishing criteria are listed in the adjacent table. Care should be taken when using these properties as many of those listed have been determined from synthetically grown, pure-composition pyrope. Others, such as pyrope's high specific gravity, may be of little use when studying a small crystal embedded in a matrix of other silicate minerals. In these cases, <b>mineral</b> <b>association</b> with other mafic and ultramafic minerals may be the best indication that the garnet you are studying is pyrope.|$|E

50|$|In 1938 C. Osborne Hutton {{described}} a manganoan member of stilpnomelane and incorrectly assumed {{it to be}} parsettensite. It was later described in 1984 by Pete J. Dunn, Donald R. Peacor and William B. Simmons as a Mn dominant stilpnomelane similar to parsettensite. Naming franklinphilite was deferred then due to findings of only 34 mol % of the theoretical manganese end-member, making it manganese dominant by plurality. In 1992, franklinphilite was revisited by Dunn, Peacor and Shu-Chu Su and given an International <b>Mineral</b> <b>Association</b> recognized name. Although all franklinphilite specimens originated exclusively from the Buckwheat dump, large amounts of manganese silicates in the area suggest a high probability of other assemblages. Franklinphilite was named for the type locality (Franklin) and the Greek word φιλόϛ (philos) meaning friend. The name alludes to the unique elements of its chemical composition {{that contribute to the}} uniqueness of Franklin and Sterling Hill and the geologists, mineralogists and collectors, friends of Franklin, who helped contribute towards the understanding of the region.|$|E
5000|$|In 1879, George William Stow was {{commissioned}} by the Orange Free State government to look for coal deposits in the Bethlehem district With no deposits found he moved northwards to Maccauvlei on the Vaal River and then crossed the river to the Transvaal side. On the farm Leeuwkuil, he found a coal deposits twelve feet thick. But the Orange Free State government {{believed that it was}} too far away and {{there was a lack of}} transport so turned down the idea of mining. Stow settled in Kimberley in order to find a job where he met Samuel Marks who realized after hearing the formers story, the opportunity for coal at the Kimberley diamond fields for energy generation. Marks formed the De Zuid Afrikaanshe en Oranje Vrystaatsche Kolen and Mineralen Vereeniging (South African and Orange Free State Coal and <b>Mineral</b> <b>Association)</b> and sent Stow to purchase the farms where the coal was found. On the 25 November 1880 he purchased the farm Leeuwkuil for £5,000 and 12,000 acres. Marks' agent J.G. Fraser would purchase the farm Klipplaatdrift of 6,000 acres from Karl August Pretorius in October 1881 for ₤15,500. This was opposite the farm Maccauvlei. From 1881, coal was taken by ox-wagon to Kimberley and by 1882 there was so much development that there was a need to survey a village on the two farms and the Volksraad agreed naming it after the company's shortened name Vereeniging.|$|E

40|$|The ancient Moldanubian {{structure}} of the Bohemian Massif probably was poor in ore deposits. The upper Proterozoic and Paleozoic geosynclinal development and regional metamorphism effected a new redistribution and supply of material and {{are believed to be}} metallogically of the highest importance. A model of a process that might enrich some zones and areas in ore-forming constituents is given. Units with characteristic structure and development in the Bohemian Massif contain specific types of mineralization. These types of endogenous, mainly hydrothermal min-eralization have been defined as isogenous <b>mineral</b> <b>associations.</b> Two main and different groups of Variscan intrusives, each with a different source and each with related isog-enous <b>mineral</b> <b>associations,</b> form two principal petrometallogenic groups.

40|$|Blueschists were {{discovered}} in the metamorphic rocks of the Medvednica mountain. Two varieties of blueschists are recognised, one with garnets and another with omphacite. Determined <b>mineral</b> <b>associations</b> are composed of sodic amphibole (glaucophane and crossite), garnet, omphacite and white mica. These <b>mineral</b> <b>associations</b> indicate metamorphic conditions which are transitional between blueschist and eclogite facies, i. e. high pressures at relatively moderate temperatures (LG, HP/LT). Such conditions are often characteristic of subduction zones. The occurrence of high-pressure metamorphic rocks in the Medvednica mountain, together with local outcrops of ultramafic rocks (serpentinised harzburgite, dunite and serpentinite) indicate subduction related rocks of the Dinaric part of the Tethyan oceanic crust. In {{the northern part of}} the Dinarides, ultramafic rocks and glaucophane schists have also been found in the Motajica and Fruska gora mountains.
