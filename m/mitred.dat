25|$|A more {{sophisticated}} device was the staunch or water gate, {{consisting of a}} gate (or pair of <b>mitred</b> gates) which could be closed (and held shut by water pressure) when the river was low, to float vessels over upstream shallows at times of low water. However, the whole upstream head of water had to be drained (by some auxiliary method approaching modern sluices) before a boat could pass. Accordingly, they were not used where the obstacle to be passed was a mill weir.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Mitre</b> (Greek [...] ) : The Byzantine Orthodox <b>mitre</b> {{is modeled}} on the ancient Byzantine {{imperial}} crown; it is worn by all bishops and in some Slavic traditions also awarded to some high-ranking priests. The bishop's <b>mitre</b> is surmounted by a cross, but the priest's is not; both are bulbous and adorned with icons. Coptic Orthodox & Ethiopian Orthodox bishops also wear the Byzantine <b>mitre.</b> Armenian Orthodox, on the other hand, have the Byzantine <b>mitre</b> {{as part of the}} normal vestments worn by priests of all ranks, and their bishops are distinguished by wearing <b>mitres</b> after the western shape. <b>Mitres</b> are not worn in the Syriac Orthodox tradition, where a decorated hood like an amice called masnaphto, meaning 'turban', is worn instead by prelates. https://web.archive.org/web/20050429003948/http://www.svots.edu/Three-Hierarchs-Chapel/2005-0403-cross-ordinations/pages/DSC_0191_jpg.htm.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} {{maintained}} {{that the right to}} wear mitres was sometimes granted by the popes to abbots before the 11th century, but the documents on which this claim is based are not genuine (J. Braun, Liturgische Gewandung, p.453). The first undoubted instance is the bull by which Alexander II in 1063 granted the use of the mitre to Egelsinus, abbot of the monastery of St Augustine at Canterbury. The <b>mitred</b> abbots in England were those of Abingdon, St Alban's, Bardney, Battle, Bury St Edmunds, St Augustine's Canterbury, Colchester, Croyland, Evesham, Glastonbury, Gloucester, St Benet's Hulme, Hyde, Malmesbury, Peterborough, Ramsey, Reading, Selby, Shrewsbury, Tavistock, Thorney, Westminster, Winchcombe, and St Mary's York. Of these the precedence was yielded to the abbot of Glastonbury, until in AD 1154 Adrian IV (Nicholas Breakspear) granted it to the abbot of St Alban's, in which monastery he had been brought up. Next after the abbot of St Alban's ranked the abbot of Westminster and then Ramsey. Elsewhere, the <b>mitred</b> abbots that sat in the Estates of Scotland were of Arbroath, Cambuskenneth, Coupar Angus, Dunfermline, Holyrood, Iona, Kelso, Kilwinning, Kinloss, Lindores, Paisley, Melrose, Scone, St Andrews Priory and Sweetheart. To distinguish abbots from bishops, it was ordained that their mitre should be made of less costly materials, and should not be ornamented with gold, a rule which was soon entirely disregarded, and that the crook of their pastoral staff (the crosier) should turn inwards instead of outwards, indicating that their jurisdiction was limited to their own house.|$|E
25|$|In plan view, the twin-mainfloats, {{like those}} of the Short N.2B, were square-fronted with a slight {{increase}} in beam from front to rear, while the stern tapered to a point like a <b>mitred</b> arch. They had a concave bottom (the edges were protected by metal strips) and a sharp step at approximately 3/4 length; a tailfloat was fitted to the fuselage below the conventional tailplane. Attached {{to the rear of the}} tailfloat was a taxying rudder, with an additional drop-plate which improved steering on water, and which, thanks to the hinged mounting at the forward end, would rise up into its recess in the tailfloat on contact with the ground when beaching. Wingtip floats were deemed unnecessary. A detail drawing, which appeared in Flight Magazine in 1920, showed the empennage and tailfloat assembly, including the hinged rudder drop-plate.|$|E

500|$|During {{the first}} half of the 14thcentury, the priory {{suffered}} from financial mismanagement and disputes with the Dutton family, exacerbated by a severe flood in 1331 that reduced the income from the priory's lands. The direct effects of the Black Death are not known, but during the 1350s financial problems continued. These were party mitigated with the selling of the advowson of the church at Ratcliffe-on-Soar. Matters further improved from 1366 with the appointment of Richard Wyche as prior. He was active in the governance of the wider Augustinian order and in political affairs, and in 1391 was involved in raising the priory's status to that of a <b>mitred</b> abbey. A <b>mitred</b> abbey was one in which the abbot was given permission to use pontifical insignia, including the mitre, ring and pontifical staff, and to give the solemn benediction provided a bishop was not present. It was rare for an Augustinian house to be elevated to this status. Out of about 200Augustinian houses in England and Wales, 28were abbeys and only seven of these became <b>mitred.</b> The only other <b>mitred</b> abbey in Cheshire was that of StWerburgh in Chester. In 1379 and in 1381 there were 15canons at Norton and in 1401 there were 16, making it the largest Augustinian community in the northwest of England. By this time the barony of Halton had passed by a series of marriages to the duchy of Lancaster. John of Gaunt, the 1stDuke of Lancaster and 14thBaron of Halton, agreed to be the patron of the newly formed abbey. At this date the church was [...] long; it was the second longest Augustinian church in northwest England, exceeded only by the [...] long church at Carlisle. Towards the end of the 14thcentury, the abbey acquired a [...] "giant" [...] statue of SaintChristopher. Three wills from members of the Dutton family from this period survive; they are dated 1392, 1442 and 1527, and in each will money was bequeathed to the foundation.|$|E

It was also recorded that the queen offered to let the abbot and his monks stay at Westminster if they conformed to the Church of England. Feckenham sat in Elizabeth's first parliament, and was the last <b>mitred</b> abbot to do so. He consistently opposed all the legislation for changes in religion, and he refused the Oath of Supremacy. The abbey was dissolved again on 12 July 1560, and within a year Feckenham was sent by Archbishop Matthew Parker to the Tower (20 May 1560), according to Jewel, [...] "for having obstinately refused attendance on public worship and everywhere declaiming and railing against that religion which we now profess." ...|$|E

[...] As a <b>mitred</b> abbot he was entitled to be tried by Parliament, but no scruples troubled the chancellor, Thomas Cromwell. His death sentence was passed before his trial began. Along with John Rugg, a known associate, and John Eynon, the priest of St Giles' Church in Reading, he was found guilty and hanged, drawn and quartered before the inner Abbey gatehouse on 14 November 1539. The monks of Reading, not under suspicion of complicity in the Abbot's alleged treason, were given pensions normally set upon monks and nuns at the dissolution of their monasteries.|$|E

50|$|In ecclesiastical heraldry, a <b>mitre</b> {{was placed}} above the shield of all persons who were {{entitled}} to wear the <b>mitre,</b> including abbots. It substituted for the helm of military arms, but also appeared as a crest placed atop a helmet, as was common in German heraldry. In the Anglican Churches, the <b>mitre</b> is still placed above the arms of bishops instead of the ecclesiastical hat. In the Roman Catholic Church, {{the use of the}} <b>mitre</b> above the shield on the personal arms of clergy was suppressed in 1969, and is now found only on some corporate arms, like those of dioceses. Previously, the <b>mitre</b> was often included under the hat, and even in the arms of a cardinal, the <b>mitre</b> was not entirely displaced.In heraldry the <b>mitre</b> is always shown in gold, and the lappets (infulae) are of the same colour. It has been asserted that before the reformation, a distinction was used to be drawn between the <b>mitre</b> of a bishop and an abbot by the omission of the infulae in the abbot's arms. In England and France it was usual to place the <b>mitre</b> of an abbot slightly in profile.|$|R
2500|$|The statue {{has been}} dated on stylistic grounds {{to have been}} {{produced}} between 1375 and 1400. [...] The status of the foundation at Norton was raised {{from that of a}} priory to a <b>mitred</b> abbey in 1391, and it has been suggested by J. Patrick Greene, the director of the excavations in the 1970s and 1980s, that the statue may have been commissioned as a result of this. [...] The priory was dedicated to StMary, and when its status was raised to that of an abbey, StChristopher was adopted as a subsidiary patron saint. [...] The sandstone was probably obtained from a quarry [...] from the priory at Windmill Hill. [...] It is likely that the statue was carved at the priory, but the identity of the sculptor is not known. [...] The original position of the statue in the priory is uncertain. Greene suggested that it stood in the outer courtyard of the priory, where it is shown in a print dated 1727. [...] However Marrow argued that it was probably originally placed at the west end of the abbey church. [...] He supports this by the fact that statues of StChristopher were sited at the west end of Notre Dame in Paris and the church in Terrington St Clement, Norfolk. [...] He also says that the crispness of the carving is consistent with the statue having been indoors for part of its existence.|$|E
