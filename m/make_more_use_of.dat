5|$|The {{technique}} of flight among procellariids depends on foraging methods. Compared {{to an average}} bird, all procellariids have a high aspect ratio (meaning their wings are long and narrow) and a heavy wing loading. Therefore, they must maintain a high speed {{in order to remain}} in the air. Most procellariids use two techniques to do this, namely, dynamic soaring and slope soaring. Dynamic soaring involves gliding across wave fronts, thus taking advantage of the vertical wind gradient and minimising the effort required to stay in the air. Slope soaring is more straightforward: the procellariid turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea. Most procellariids aid their flight by means of flap-glides, where bursts of flapping are followed by a period of gliding; the amount of flapping dependent on the strength of the wind and the choppiness of the water. Shearwaters and other larger petrels, which have lower aspect ratio, must <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> flapping to remain airborne than gadfly petrels. Because of the high speeds required for flight, procellariids need to either run or face into a strong wind in order to take off.|$|E

25|$|Goregrind, deathgrind and pornogrind are {{styles that}} mix the intensity, speed, and brevity of grindcore with the {{complexity}} of death metal. They differ from death metal in that guitar solos are often a rarity, shrieked vocals are more prominent as the main vocal (though death growls are still utilized and some deathgrind bands <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the latter vocal style), and songs are generally shorter in length, usually between one and three minutes that keep with grindcore's tradition of short time lengths in songs. All three of these styles differ from grindcore in the more technical approach and less evident hardcore punk influence and aesthetics. Some notable examples of deathgrind are Brujeria, Cattle Decapitation, Cephalic Carnage, Pig Destroyer, Circle of Dead Children, Rotten Sound, Gut and Cock and Ball Torture.|$|E

In fact, given the mechanical disadvantages and restricted usefulness of wheels when compared with limbs, the central question can be reversed: not [...] "Why does nature not produce wheels?", but rather, [...] "Why do human vehicles not <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> limbs?" [...] The use of wheels rather than limbs in many engineered vehicles can likely be attributed to the complexity of design required to construct and control limbs, rather than to a consistent functional advantage of wheels over limbs.|$|E

Delays in shooting meant that Williams was forced to start working on the score before the film was completed. Szwarc discussed the film with the composer, showing him edited sequences and storyboards. The director praises Williams in being able to work under such difficult conditions. Critic Mike Beek suggests these time constraints enabled Williams [...] "to create themes based on ideas and suggestions, rather than a locked down print." ...|$|E

Cheng found Don't Starve to have [...] "ended up a way better game because of the community."

500|$|Although [...] "On the Banks of Wabash, Far Away" [...] is Indiana's {{official}} song, [...] "Back Home Again in Indiana" [...] is {{more widely}} used and is falsely believed {{by many to}} be the state song.

500|$|The {{period after}} the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars offered {{tremendous}} opportunities for collectors of {{the decorative arts}} of the medieval and Renaissance periods. These categories were valued very little by the art market in general, and metalwork was routinely sold for its bullion value alone. Some of the older objects in precious metal in the collection may have first been received by the family as part of banking transactions; ownership of such pieces had always been partly {{a way to get}} some use from capital. [...] Ferdinand records several complaints that his father did not <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> his opportunities, but in his last years Anselm began to expand his collecting range, and it was he who bought both the Holy Thorn Reliquary and the Ghisi Shield. [...] This golden age for collectors had passed by the time Ferdinand inherited his part of his father's collection in 1874, which was also the year he bought the Waddesdon estate and began to build there. Ferdinand continued to expand the collection until his death in 1898, mostly using dealers, and expanding the range of objects collected. [...] In particular Ferdinand expanded to around fifty the ten or so pieces of jewellery in his father's collection.|$|E
500|$|Pemberton and Shearsmith are fans {{of classic}} horror films, and the episode {{displays}} {{inspiration from the}} likes of Alfred Hitchcock's filmography and the Hammer Horror films. Pemberton called the episode the [...] "most genre" [...] of the series, while Shearsmith described it as their attempt to produce a [...] "full on ... gothic horror-esque" [...] episode. The writers utilised the horror norm of a gothic mansion rather than bringing horror into a normal home. This route, Shearsmith suggested, has now become atypical. The setting allowed the writers to mix modern elements with traditional gothic horror, sometimes for comedic effect (a reference to [...] "something called broadbands"), and sometimes to add to the horror (mobile phones cannot be used, as the characters are in a [...] "dead zone"). While the writers did want the episode grounded in reality, they also wanted to <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> gothic horror tropes than they had in other episodes of Inside No. 9. [...] "The Harrowing" [...] was advertised with a poster homage to classic horror films. The poster was designed by Graham Humphreys, a graphic designer known for his work on horror film posters. The episode's name was taken from the Harrowing of Hell, the story of Jesus Christ's descent to Hell in Christian theology.|$|E

2500|$|Out of all {{immigrant}} groups, Moroccan immigrants used French the most, which gained increasing importance alongside Berber and Moroccan Arabic {{in their}} already bilingual community. The Turks {{held on to}} their own language, although French also gained importance in their community. Dutch struggled to take hold in these two migrant groups. [...] Children from these communities attended (and often continue to attend) French-language education, and used French in their circles of friends and at home. This evolution is also seen with Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian migrants, who easily adopted French due to its similarity to other Romance languages that many already spoke. The northern Europeans, who {{are not nearly as}} numerous, came mainly after the 1980s, <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> their own languages, such as English and German.

2500|$|Despite {{their growing}} popularity, {{by the time}} Maddock joined the company in September 1948 they were still not {{large enough to be}} able to justify taking on a {{full-time}} engineer. In addition to his drafting duties Maddock therefore also filled the roles of fitter, storekeeper and van driver, among many. Gradually the Coopers began to <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Maddock's drafting skills, however, realising that having proper technical drawings was preferable to sketching designs to full scale on the walls, where they were frequently painted over! Some smaller parts were fabricated from crude sketches, or frequently simply by eye. During his time with Cooper Maddock became renowned for the detail and artistry of his blueprints, and with a talent for lateral thinking his contribution to the design of Cooper's cars grew rapidly. By the time of Cooper's heyday the design process was essentially a three-way tag match between Maddock, John Cooper and star driver Jack Brabham. Maddock's protégé and eventual successor, Eddie Stait, later recalled to historian Doug Nye that [...] "John had a lot of the original ideas and then Owen would add some very original thinking in developing those ideas; they were a team ... and Jack of course contributed a lot." ...|$|E
