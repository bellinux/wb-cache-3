5|$|By 2008 <b>many</b> <b>Democrats</b> were {{considering}} this approach {{as the basis}} for healthcare reform. Experts said that the legislation that eventually emerged from Congress in 2009 and 2010 bore similarities to the 2007 bill and that it was deliberately patterned after Romney's state healthcare plan.|$|E
5|$|Minton {{received}} a death {{threat in the}} form of an envelope containing a shotgun shell and a message advising him to not vote for the court packing plan. <b>Many</b> <b>Democrats,</b> fearing their re-election prospects, joined with Republicans and defeated the bill. Minton was unhappy with the loss and it cost him considerable support among his voters, but as a result of his close connection with the bill and the leaders of his party, he gained more influence with the Democrats.|$|E
5|$|Morton was reelected to office, {{defeating}} Democrat {{and longtime}} friend Joseph McDonald {{by more than}} 20,000 votes. Although the campaign was conducted in time of war, with both parties strongly opposing the other, both Morton and McDonald remained friends after the campaign and later served together in the U.S. Senate. <b>Many</b> <b>Democrats</b> claimed that Morton had rigged the election because Republicans retook the majority {{in both houses of}} the Assembly.|$|E
50|$|On 10 July, Lamian Yusuk, an 80-year-old Rayong {{inhabitant}} and {{supporter of}} the Democrat Party, committed suicide by consuming herbicide after the party's poor performance. <b>Many</b> <b>Democrat</b> members of the House of Representatives attended her funeral. Abhisit, who did not attend, later offered condolences to Yusuk's relatives by phone. Yusuk's death attracted {{both positive and negative}} criticism of the deceased.|$|R

5|$|The tariff levels {{had been}} a major {{political}} issue since before the Civil War, and they became the most dominant matter of the 1888 election. The high tariff rates had created a surplus {{of money in the}} Treasury, which led <b>many</b> <b>Democrats</b> (as well as the growing Populist movement) to call for lowering them. Most Republicans preferred to maintain the rates, spend the surplus on internal improvements and eliminate some internal taxes.|$|E
5|$|As the 1880 presidential {{elections}} approached, <b>many</b> <b>Democrats</b> remained convinced Tilden had been robbed {{of the presidency}} in 1876. In the House, Tilden supporter Clarkson Nott Potter of New York sought {{an investigation into the}} 1876 election in Florida and Louisiana, hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance would harm that party's candidate in 1880. The Democratic caucus, including Randall, unanimously endorsed the idea, and the committee convened in May 1878. Some in the caucus wished to investigate the entire election, but Randall and the more moderate members worked to limit the committee's reach to the two disputed states.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's role as {{a liberal}} lion in the Senate {{came to the fore}} in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and {{legislation}} intending to fulfill the Contract with America was coming from Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives. <b>Many</b> <b>Democrats</b> in the Senate and the country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans. By the beginning of 1996, the Republicans had overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass the Senate and the Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it coming out of Kennedy's staff.|$|E
500|$|Following Todd Akin's {{controversial}} [...] "legitimate rape" [...] comments, Brown was {{the first}} sitting Senator to demand he {{drop out of the}} Missouri U.S. Senate race. He also called on his Party to [...] "recognize in its platform that you can be pro-choice and still be a good Republican." [...] Brown's campaign had been endorsed by <b>many</b> Massachusetts <b>Democrats,</b> <b>many</b> of whom were prominently featured in his campaign ads.|$|R
50|$|López-Istúriz {{has been}} always very {{interested}} in trans-Atlantic relationships, especially with the United States. As {{a member of the}} respective delegation in the European Parliament and also as Secretary-General of the European People’s Party, he travels frequently to that country and holds meetings with politicians and other civil society actors.López-Istúriz has shown political preference for the Republican Party, in fact endorsing Senator John McCain during the 2008 presidential elections campaign. Nevertheless, he has also met <b>many</b> <b>democrat</b> leaders and expressed his best wishes to Barack Obama after the elections.|$|R
5000|$|... "Despite ticking so <b>many</b> <b>Democrat</b> boxes - Irish name, New Yorker, {{software}} designer, gay-friendly, non-churchgoer - Evan Maloney is a Republican," [...] wrote a Daily Telegraph {{reporter in}} 2005. The reporter noted that Maloney, {{whom he met}} in a Union Square coffeeshop, said with anger, [...] "Right here, two days after 9/11, there was a demonstration of people saying we got what we deserved. I was sickened - it was like saying a rape victim had it coming because she dressed provocatively. That's when my passion for politics reignited." ...|$|R
5|$|Marshall {{was inaugurated}} as Governor of Indiana on January 11, 1909. Since his party {{had been out}} of power for many years, its initial {{objective}} was to appoint as <b>many</b> <b>Democrats</b> as possible to patronage positions. Marshall tried to avoid becoming directly involved in the patronage system. He allowed the party's different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices. He allowed Taggart to manage the process and pick the candidates, but signed off himself on the official appointments. Although his position on patronage kept peace in his party, it prevented him from building a strong political base.|$|E
5|$|Carlisle {{selected}} William Ralls Morrison, another tariff reformer, to {{lead the}} Ways and Means committee, but allowed Randall {{to take charge of}} Appropriations. Morrison's committee produced a bill proposing tariff reductions of 20%; Randall opposed the idea from the start, as did the Republicans. Another bout of illness kept Randall away from Congress at a crucial time in April 1884, and the tariff bill passed a procedural hurdle by just two votes. Two days later, Randall's Appropriations committee reported several funding bills with his support. <b>Many</b> <b>Democrats</b> who had voted for Morrison's tariff were thereby reminded that Randall had the power to defeat spending that was important to them; when the final vote came, enough switched sides to join with Republicans in defeating the reform 156 to 151.|$|E
5|$|In the 1876 presidential election, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio {{defeated}} Democrat Samuel J. Tilden of New York {{in one of}} {{the most}} hotly contested presidential elections to that time in the nation's history. The results initially indicated a Democratic victory, but the electoral votes of several states were ardently disputed until mere days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which ultimately decided the race for Hayes. Payne was named to the committee at Tilden's request, but the results went against the Democrats as Hayes was declared the winner of the disputed votes. After the Commissions result, Payne joined <b>many</b> <b>Democrats</b> in attempting to delay the House proceedings in hopes of forcing a more favorable result, but was outvoted by Republicans and the Democrats who sided with Speaker Samuel J. Randall in accepting the Commission's result. The effort failed, and Hayes became president on March 4, 1877.|$|E
50|$|Andrew Cash {{lost his}} seat in the general {{election}} held October 19, 2015, one of <b>many</b> New <b>Democrats</b> who were swept away when the Liberal party came from third place to form a majority government.|$|R
25|$|Bush {{announced}} his reelection bid in early 1992; with a coalition {{victory in the}} Persian Gulf War and high approval ratings, reelection initially looked likely. As a result, <b>many</b> leading <b>Democrats</b> declined to seek their party's presidential nomination.|$|R
50|$|Like <b>many</b> Cleveland <b>Democrats,</b> {{including}} his long-time friend Mark Twain, Wood joined the American Anti-Imperialist League. The League {{called for the}} United States to grant immediate independence to the Philippines and other territories conquered in the Spanish-American War.|$|R
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{were anxious}} to return Senator J. C. S. Blackburn to his seat in Congress, but some were instead {{supporting}} ex-Governor John Y. Brown. Democratic state senator Albert Berry was also making overtures about being considered for the seat. Republican legislators nominated W. Godfrey Hunter for the seat, and ultimately, Blackburn and Hunter emerged as the leading candidates. The Gold Democrats refused to back Blackburn, a free silver supporter, instead opting for ex-Governor James B. McCreary. On ballot after ballot, no candidate received a majority, though Blackburn received 65 votes once, leaving him just two votes shy of election. Treasury Secretary John G. Carlisle was put forward as a compromise candidate, but never received more than 61 votes. Other proposed compromise candidates included Louisville Courier-Journal editor Henry Watterson, congressman Walter Evans, ex-Governor Buckner, Judge William H. Holt, and Augustus E. Willson.|$|E
5|$|Revenue from tariffs {{was then}} {{a major source of}} income for the federal government. There was no federal income tax, and tariff debates were passionate; the 1888 presidential {{election}} had them as a major issue. <b>Many</b> <b>Democrats</b> supported a tariff for revenue only—that is, the purpose of tariffs should be to finance government, not to encourage American manufacturers. McKinley disagreed with that and sponsored the McKinley Tariff of 1890. This act, passed by the Republican-dominated Congress, raised rates on imports to protect American industry. McKinley's tariff proved unpopular among many people who had to pay the increased prices, and was seen as a reason not only for his defeat for re-election to Congress in 1890, but also for the Republicans losing control of both House and Senate in that year's midterm elections. Nevertheless, McKinley's defeat did not, in the end, damage his political prospects, as the Democrats were blamed for gerrymandering him out of his seat.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Party {{believes}} that individuals {{should have a}} right to privacy. For example, <b>many</b> <b>Democrats</b> have opposed the NSA warrantless surveillance of U.S. citizens.|$|E
50|$|Miller's {{campaign}} {{organization was}} diverse. As well as support from <b>many</b> New <b>Democrats</b> and social activists, his top campaign strategists included veteran Conservative John Laschinger and Liberal Peter Donolo. Architect Jack Diamond {{was also a}} co-chair of his campaign.|$|R
5000|$|... The {{result was}} welcomed by <b>many</b> senior <b>Democrats,</b> {{including}} Vice-President Joe Biden; Presidential candidate, former First Lady, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; Irish-born US {{ambassador to the}} United Nations Samantha Power and former Presidential candidate Martin O’Malley.|$|R
25|$|Torture {{became a}} very {{divisive}} {{issue in the}} party after Barack Obama was elected president. <b>Many</b> centrist <b>Democrats</b> {{and members of the}} party's leadership supported the use of torture while the liberal wings continued to be steadfastly opposed to it.|$|R
25|$|The New Deal brought many conservationists to the Democratic Party, and <b>many</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{entered the}} ranks of conservationists. Leading the {{generation}} of Young Turks who revitalized the Sierra Club after World War II were attorneys Richard Leonard and Bestor Robinson, nature photographer Ansel Adams, and David Brower.|$|E
25|$|On March 16, Kennedy {{announced}} that he would run; <b>many</b> <b>Democrats</b> saw Kennedy as a stronger candidate than McCarthy. On March 31, in a surprise move, Johnson {{announced that}} he would not seek reelection. Following that, McCarthy won in Wisconsin, where the Kennedy campaign was still getting organized. McCarthy also won in Oregon against a well-organized Kennedy effort.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1890s {{governor}} Theodore Roosevelt and fellow Republicans such as Charles Evans Hughes worked with <b>many</b> <b>Democrats</b> such as Al Smith to promote Progressivism. They battled trusts and monopolies (especially {{in the insurance}} industry), promoted efficiency, fought waste, and called for more democracy in politics. Democrats focused more {{on the benefits of}} progressivism for their own ethnic working class base and for labor unions.|$|E

50|$|The urban-rural {{confrontation}} of the 1920s seems neatly {{symbolized by the}} presidential election of 1928 and the defection of <b>many</b> traditional <b>Democrats</b> to the Republican candidate because of their shock at the nomination of Al Smith by their own party.|$|R
50|$|Torture {{became a}} very {{divisive}} {{issue in the}} party after Barack Obama was elected president. <b>Many</b> centrist <b>Democrats</b> {{and members of the}} party's leadership supported the use of torture while the liberal wings continued to be steadfastly opposed to it.|$|R
25|$|A {{surge of}} {{national}} unity in 1861 brought thousands flocking to the colors from every town and city. However, as the war became a crusade to end slavery, <b>many</b> <b>Democrats</b> (especially Irish Catholics) pulled back. The Democrats took a pro-slavery position and included many Copperheads willing to let the South secede. The intensely fought 1863 election for governor was narrowly won by the Republicans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{are opposed}} to the use of torture against {{individuals}} apprehended and held prisoner by the U.S. military, and hold that categorizing such prisoners as unlawful combatants does not release the U.S. from its obligations under the Geneva Conventions. Democrats contend that torture is inhumane, decreases the United States' moral standing in the world, and produces questionable results. Democrats largely spoke out against waterboarding.|$|E
25|$|With their {{position}} secure, the Democrats next tackled the state debt. <b>Many</b> <b>Democrats</b> from the upcountry, led by General Martin Gary, who had developed the Edgefield Plan for targeted violence {{to take back}} the state, pushed for the entire state debt to be canceled, but Gary was opposed by Charleston holders of the bonds. A compromise moderated by Wade Hampton was achieved and by October 1882, the state debt was reduced to $6.5 million.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Many</b> social <b>democrats</b> {{currently}} reject {{this concept}} altogether, and wish {{to retain the}} capitalist economic system by promoting a welfare state and economic interventions {{in order to make}} capitalism more [...] "equitable" [...] without questioning the legitimacy of the profits system.|$|R
5000|$|Partisanship {{flourished in}} the North and {{strengthened}} the Lincoln Administration as Republicans automatically rallied behind it. After the attack on Fort Sumter, Douglas rallied northern Democrats behind the Union, but when Douglas died, the party lacked an outstanding figure in the North, and by 1862 an anti-war peace element was gaining strength. The most intense anti-war elements were the Copperheads. [...] The Democratic Party did well in the 1862 congressional elections, but in 1864 it nominated General George McClellan, a War Democrat, on a peace platform, and lost badly because <b>many</b> War <b>Democrats</b> bolted to National Union candidate Abraham Lincoln. <b>Many</b> former <b>Democrats</b> became Republicans, especially soldiers such as generals Ulysses S. Grant and John A. Logan.|$|R
50|$|During the country's {{civil war}} in the 1970s-1980s, an extreme right-wing death squad named after him {{operated}} in the country, and claimed responsibility for the assassination of <b>many</b> Christian <b>Democrat</b> and Marxist politicians as well as innocent civilians in El Salvador in 1980.|$|R
