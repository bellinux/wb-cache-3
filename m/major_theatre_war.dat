40|$|This article investigates how key actors {{within the}} US defence policy {{community}} realigned their interests {{to forge a}} new consensus on the redirection of US defence strategy following the 'peace shock' they faced {{with the collapse of}} bipolarity. This consensus centred on the idea that achieving US security in the 'age of uncertainty' demanded overwhelming US military power, which was widely interpreted as necessitating military capabilities to fight multiple <b>major</b> <b>theatre</b> <b>wars</b> simultaneously against regional 'Third World' adversaries. This helped to preserve many of the principal pillars of US Cold War defence policy through deflecting calls for more radical organisational changes and deeper cuts to defence budgets...|$|R

5000|$|The SS-Standarte Kurt Eggers was a German Waffen SS {{propaganda}} formation which publicised {{the actions}} of all Waffen SS combat formations, seeing action in all <b>major</b> <b>theatres</b> of <b>war</b> {{with the exception of}} North Africa.

50|$|During the First World War, the battalions of 14th Punjab Regiment {{served in}} all the <b>major</b> <b>theatres</b> of <b>war.</b> The 19th Punjabis, while serving in Persia had the unique {{distinction}} of being actively engaged against the Bolsheviks in 1918 during the hard-fought actions at Merv, Kaka and Dushak in the Russian Turkestan. The 40th Pathans greatly distinguished themselves in the fighting against the Germans in France and German East Africa, {{while the rest of}} the battalions served in the Middle East.|$|R

50|$|As the Civil War {{started in}} late January 1918, the Reds {{targeted}} the important railway junction of Haapamäki, 100 kilometres north of Tampere. The frontline was soon established 50-60 kilometres north of Tampere and Tavastia Front became the <b>major</b> <b>theatre</b> of the <b>war.</b> The large working-class {{population and the}} railway connections made Tampere the main base for Red Guards, although the Red government was working in Helsinki.

5000|$|The South Pacific {{became a}} <b>major</b> <b>theatre</b> of the <b>war</b> {{following}} the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Initially, US warplans {{called for a}} counteroffensive across the Central Pacific, but this was disrupted {{by the loss of}} battleships at Pearl Harbor. During the First South Pacific Campaign, US forces sought to establish a defensive perimeter against additional Japanese attacks. This was followed by the Second South Pacific Campaign, which began with the battle of Guadalcanal.|$|R
5000|$|These, while {{connected}} with the very first administrative reforms, generally {{had to rely on}} spoliation, and coincided with a disastrous stage in the countries' history, given that the two became a <b>major</b> <b>theatre</b> of <b>war</b> in a series of confrontations between Russian, Habsburg, and Ottoman forces (until the mid-19th century, they frequently came under temporary Russian or Habsburg occupation, and sometimes administration — as happened to the regions of Oltenia, Bukovina, and Bessarabia). The high taxation, reprimations, wars and pillaging during this hundred years led to a substantial deterioration of the quality of economical and cultural life, and to a decrease of population by 30%. (The following century the population would quadruple, and in 20th century would increase by another 50%.) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{partition}} of India in 1947 {{led to the}} termination of most transport links between the newly independent nations of India and Pakistan after the cross-migration of people was completed by the 1950s. The First Kashmir War had similarly divided the Himalayan region of Kashmir between the two rivals, causing termination of road links in the region. Kashmir and the international border in the divided region of Punjab were <b>major</b> <b>theatres</b> of <b>war</b> during the Indo-Pakistani Wars of 1965 and 1971. The train connecting the Indian city of Jaipur with the Pakistani city of Karachi across the Thar Desert was destroyed when the Pakistani Air Force bombed the tracks during the 1965 war. In the 1990s, the Line of Control (LoC) demarcating the informal boundary between Indian-administered Kashmir and Pakistan-administered Kashmir {{was the scene of}} exchanges of fire between Pakistani and Indian forces and infiltration of militants into Indian Kashmir. The Kargil War of 1999 broke out when Indian force sought to repel militants and Pakistani soldiers who had infiltrated across the LoC.|$|R

500|$|After {{economic}} growth in the first two decades of the 20th century, Wales' staple industries endured a prolonged slump from the early 1920s to the late 1930s, leading to widespread unemployment and poverty in the south Wales valleys. For the first time in centuries, the population of Wales went into decline; the scourge of unemployment only relented with the production demands of the Second World War. The Second World War (1939–1945) saw Welsh servicemen and women fight in all the <b>major</b> <b>theatres</b> of <b>war,</b> with some 15,000 of them killed. Bombing raids brought major loss of life as the German Air Force targeted the docks at Swansea, Cardiff and Pembroke. After 1943, 10% of Welsh conscripts aged 18 were sent to work in the coal mines, where there were labour shortages; they became known as Bevin Boys. Pacifist numbers during both World Wars were fairly low, especially in the Second World War, which was seen as a fight against fascism. Of the political parties active in Wales, only Plaid Cymru took a neutral stance, {{on the grounds that it}} was an [...] "imperialist war".|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} of the Finnish Civil War, Lahti had a {{population}} of 6,500. The town was important for the Reds due to its location by the vital Riihimäki–Saint Petersburg railway, connecting Lahti to the <b>major</b> <b>war</b> <b>theatres</b> in Tavastia and Karelia. Red troops were formed and trained in the Hennala Garrison which the Russians had built in the early 1910s. As the Red front had collapsed {{in the northern part of}} Tavastia and the Battle of Tampere was over in 6 April, tens of thousands of Red refugees headed east through Hämeenlinna and Lahti. In the late April, there was about 40,000 Reds inside the triangle formed by the towns of Hämeenlinna, Riihimäki and Lahti.|$|R
