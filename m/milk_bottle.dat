A winch used to move railway wagons at Hemyock Dairy near Wellington was built by J. Lynn of Sunderland. There is a runnable Crossley diesel engine dating from 1935. There is a Spirax Sarco 'Ogden pump' used to pump condensate from steam lines. The collection includes the boiler which powered the Telescopic Bridge, Bridgwater.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in childhood, Crawford's {{ambition}} {{was to be}} a dancer. One day, however, in {{an attempt}} to escape piano lessons so she could play with friends, she leapt from the front porch of her home and cut her foot severely on a broken <b>milk</b> <b>bottle.</b> As a result, she experienced three surgeries to repair the damage. She was unable to attend elementary school or continue with dancing lessons for 18 months.|$|E
5|$|Cal also {{exhibits}} feminine characteristics, {{which allows}} Dr. Luce to classify her as possessing a female gender identity. In a home video taken when Cal was a child, his mother {{gives him a}} doll and he nurses it with a <b>milk</b> <b>bottle.</b> Luce carefully observes Callie's actions and diagnoses them as feminine, which causes him to determine that Callie has a feminine gender identity. Luce then concludes that gender identity is nurtured and etched into children at their young ages.|$|E
50|$|Before <b>milk</b> <b>bottles,</b> milkmen {{filled the}} customers' jugs. For many collectors, <b>milk</b> <b>bottles</b> carry a nostalgic {{quality of a}} bygone age. The most prized <b>milk</b> <b>bottles</b> are {{embossed}} or pyroglazed (painted) with names of dairies on them, which were used for home delivery of milk so that the <b>milk</b> <b>bottles</b> could find {{their way back to}} their respective dairies.|$|R

40|$|We {{surveyed}} {{customers at}} our local supermarkets to determine attitudes towards {{a system of}} reusable glass <b>milk</b> <b>bottles.</b> We created a business plan for stores to offer <b>milk</b> in reusable <b>bottles.</b> <b>Milk</b> <b>bottles</b> would {{be returned to the}} organic dairy for reuse, while customers would receive a discount from the price of the milk. We worked with local supermarkets and are advocating for the adoption of our plan in the future...|$|R
25|$|Deposit {{programs}} offer {{customers a}} financial incentive to return packaging for reuse. Although no longer common, international experience is showing {{that they can}} still be {{an effective way to}} encourage packaging reuse. However, financial incentive, unless great, may be less of an incentive than convenience: statistics show that, on average, a <b>milk</b> <b>bottle</b> is returned 12 times, whereas a lemonade bottle with a 15p deposit is returned, on average, only 3 times.|$|E
25|$|The first {{glass bottle}} {{packaging}} for milk {{was used in}} the 1870s. The first company to do so may have been the New York Dairy Company in 1877. The Express Dairy Company in England began glass bottle production in 1880. In 1884, Hervey Thatcher, an American inventor from New York, invented a glass <b>milk</b> <b>bottle,</b> called 'Thatcher's Common Sense Milk Jar', which was sealed with a waxed paper disk. Later, in 1932, plastic-coated paper milk cartons were introduced commercially.|$|E
25|$|The Museum {{is housed}} in a renovated {{industrial}} building. A large glass elevator provides access to the upper floors of the museum. The elevator was once located outside the museum but is now inside due to the Museum's 2006-2007 expansion and renovation. The ground floor houses the museum's admissions area, a gift shop, and an Au Bon Pain cafe. Outside, a large deck overlooks the Fort Point Channel and Boston Harbor and hosts the landmark Hood <b>Milk</b> <b>Bottle.</b>|$|E

25|$|At the 1993 Indianapolis 500, winner Emerson Fittipaldi, {{who owned}} and {{operated}} an orange grove, notoriously drank orange juice instead of milk during the televised winner's interview. He eventually relented and also drank from the <b>milk</b> <b>bottle</b> later in the post-race ceremonies after the broadcast was over, but the public relations damage had already been done. The snub led to Fittipaldi being booed at the next ChampCar race, the Milwaukee Mile, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the heart of dairy country, and by some, {{as late as the}} 2008 Indianapolis 500 in which he drove the pace car. In the 2016 Indianapolis 500, as a promotion, the track gave out commemorative bottles of milk to 100,000 attendees to toast the winner with milk after the race.|$|E
25|$|The Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS), or toss bombing, tactic {{was first}} made public {{in front of}} a crowd of 3,000 {{including}} 11 state governors on 7 May 1957 at Eglin AFB, when a B–47 Stratojet entered its bombing run at low altitude, pulled up sharply (3.5 g) into a half loop, releasing its bomb under computer control at a predetermined point in its climb, then executed a half roll, completing a maneuver similar to an Immelmann turn or Half Cuban Eight. The bomb continued upward for some time in a high arc before falling on a target which was a considerable distance from its point of release. In the meantime, the maneuver had allowed the bomber to change direction and distance itself from the target. The development of this system at Eglin dated to at least mid-1955 under Project Back Breaker. The unintended consequence of this tactic would be a series of crashes by B-47s in early 1958 caused by stress-induced cracks which caused the bombers to shed their wings. A fleet-wide inspection and repair program known as <b>Milk</b> <b>Bottle</b> was begun in May 1958 which led to no fewer than nine Technical Orders, with most aircraft cycled through the program by October 1958.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Milk</b> <b>bottles</b> {{before the}} 1930s were round. In 1935, slender-neck bottles were {{introduced}} in the UK. In the 1940s, a square squat bottle became the more popular style. <b>Milk</b> <b>bottles</b> since the 1930s have used pyroglaze or ACL (Applied Color Label) to identify the bottles. Before the 1930s, names were embossed on <b>milk</b> <b>bottles</b> using a slug plate. The name was impressed on the slug plate, then the plate was inserted into the mold {{used to make the}} bottle - the result was the embossed name on the bottle. In 1980 a new bottle, nicknamed [...] "dumpy," [...] was introduced in the UK where it remains the standard now.|$|R
2500|$|The bottle {{underwent}} extensive renovations. In fall 2006, {{the bottle}} was [...] "uncapped" [...] -- its original top half was sliced off and preserved—so that its base could be moved slightly and rebuilt {{on the new}} Hood <b>Milk</b> <b>Bottle</b> Plaza. A renovated bottle was put back in place and officially re-dedicated by Boston Mayor Thomas Menino on April 20, 2007, thirty {{years to the day}} after it was moved to Children's Wharf.|$|E
2500|$|The Hood <b>Milk</b> <b>Bottle</b> was {{originally}} {{located on the}} banks of the Three Mile River on Winthrop Street (Route 44) in Taunton, Massachusetts. Arthur Gagner built the structure in 1933 to sell homemade ice cream next to his store. It was one of the first fast-food drive-in restaurants in the United States and was built using the [...] "Coney Island" [...] style of architecture. Gagner sold the bottle to the Sankey family in 1943. It was abandoned in 1967. [...] The bottle stood vacant for ten years until H.P. Hood and Sons, Inc. was persuaded to buy it and give it to Boston Children's Museum in 1977.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century the most common {{production}} in the city was glass, fertilizer, beer and leather. The glass often went into beer bottles. Much of the Virginia Glass Company effort went to supply the demands of the Robert Portner Brewing Company, until fire destroyed the St. Asaph Street plant on February 18, 1905. The Old Dominion Glass Company also had a glass works fall to fire, then built a new one. The Belle Pre Bottle Company held a monopoly on a <b>milk</b> <b>bottle</b> that they patented, yet that organization only lasted 10 years. Most businesses were smaller where the business occupied the first floor of a building and the owner and family lived above. [...] Prohibition closed Portner Brewing in 1916.|$|E

2500|$|Industrial {{development}} in Ivy City {{began in the}} 1930s. The District of Columbia was only the second municipality in the United States (after New York City) to adopt a zoning code. With the Zoning Act of March 1, 1920, Congress authorized the District government to establish zoning and created a District of Columbia Zoning Commission to oversee zoning rules, regulation, implementation, and enforcement. The New York Avenue Corridor and Ivy City were zoned for combined use, which meant residential, retail, and industrial uses were all permitted. Once New York Avenue NE was paved in 1931, numerous filling stations quickly lined the street. Over the next three years, a number of industrial concerns opened in the neighborhood: [...] A Washington <b>Milk</b> <b>Bottle</b> Exchange cleaning facility and glass factory on Fenwick Street south of New York Avenue; the offices of Mitchell & Unsinn, a construction firm, at 2006 Fenwick Street; the offices of R.E.A. Cleaning, an industrial cleaning firm, at 1925 New York Avenue; and the Nehi bottling plant at 1923 New York Avenue. In mid-1934, the F.P. May Co., a hardware retailer, opened a large warehouse at New York Avenue and West Virginia Avenue. By {{the end of the}} year, Greyhound Bus Lines had constructed a bus station at 1900 New York Avenue NE, occupying [...] of the street. The Youngsborough Syndicate, a group of real estate investors, also purchased a large number of parcels along New York Avenue, Fairview Avenue, Gallaudet Street, and Fenwick Street with the intention of creating an industrial park. The Miller Casket Co., a coffin manufacturer, also opened a factory on New York Avenue between Kendall Street and Fenwick Avenue. In 1937, the Hecht Company constructed a warehouse at 1401 New York Avenue NE. Described by The Washington Post as the pinnacle of industrial design, the [...] structure was built in the Streamline Moderne architectural style. The six-story building made extensive use of glass brick along its exterior walls, culminating in a seventh-story glass brick tower which was brilliantly lit at night.|$|E
