Need the systematic study for the DB that can predict mechanical properties of composite material and fiber orientation distribution by the fiber content ratio was not constructed. Therefore, this study investigated what affect the fiber content ratio and fiber orientation distribution have {{on the strength of}} composite sheet after making Glass <b>Mat</b> Reinforced Thermoplastic <b>Sheet</b> by changing fiber orientation distribution with the fiber content ratio. The result of this study will become a guide to design data of the most suitable parts design or fiber reinforced polymeric composite sheet that uses the Glass <b>Mat</b> Reinforced Thermoplastic <b>Sheet</b> in industry part, because it was conducted in terms of developing products. It studied the effect the fiber orientation distribution has on tensile strength of Glass <b>Mat</b> Reinforced Thermoplastic <b>Sheet</b> and achieved this result below. The increasing range of the value of Glass <b>Mat</b> Reinforced Thermoplastic <b>Sheet’s</b> tensile strength in the fiber orientation direction is getting wider as the fiber content increases...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) with macroscopically ordered structures (e. g., aligned or patterned <b>mats,</b> fibers, and <b>sheets)</b> {{and associated}} large surface areas have proven promising as new CNT electroactive polymer materials (CNT-EAPs) {{for the development}} of advanced chemical and biological sensors. The functionalization of CNTs with many biological species to gain specific surface characteristics and to facilitate electron transfer to and from them for chemical- and bio-sensing applications is an area of intense research activity. Mechanical actuation generated by CNT-EAPs is another exciting electroactive function provided by these versatile materials. Controlled mechanical deformation for actuation has been demonstrated in CNT <b>mats,</b> fibers, <b>sheets,</b> and individual nanotubes.

40|$|In {{order to}} provide a set of {{reference}} photographs {{to be used in}} identification studies, electron micrographs, at relatively high magnification (40, 000 to 132 ~ 000 diameters), together with some electron diffraction patterns, have been obtained of a group of (a) kaolinites, (b) halloysites, and (c) South Texas outcrop soil samples. Some o{ the kaolinites consist of well-formed hexagonal crystal plates with edges still sharp at a magnification of 132, 000 diameters. Other kaolinites consist of irregular, rela-tively thin crystal sheets, which may be bent or folded. In one instance it has been possible to demonstrate hat the average thickness of the sheets is only 10 A. At high magnification the halloysite clay minerals exhibit a structure consisting of rolled sheets, rather than hollow rods. In some cases, it is evident hat several separate crystal sheets are coaxially rolled to form multiple concentric hollow tubes. In the South Texas outcrop samples, the morphology is very complex, as the samples do not consist of one uniform type of particle. <b>Matted</b> <b>sheets</b> composed of interlaced bundles of lath-like particles have been observed. These oriented particles exhibit ypical "fiber" type electron diffraction patterns. Kikuchi lines were observed in a thin quartz crystal plate, examined for comparative purposes...|$|R

50|$|There {{are various}} methods for storing papyri. The {{first and most}} common of these is to use two frames of glass and seal the edges with cloth tape. However, this method {{presents}} many risks to the object. One of these risks is this method {{opens the door for}} the object to be in contact with heat and moisture, which would also make the object's surface to stick to the glass. Another method is using the Stabiltex Sling System, which is a much safer method to store papyrus fragments. This storage method consists the use of a double-windowed <b>mat</b> with two <b>sheets</b> of Stabiltex covering the object. A third method for storing papyri, especially for oversized papyri, is placing the papyrus between two layers of plexiglass and then securing them with an aluminum frame cut to the size to support the piece.|$|R
60|$|So in Samoa {{only the}} spirits of the unburied awake fear. During the late war many fell in the bush; their bodies, {{sometimes}} headless, were brought back by native pastors and interred; but this (I know not why) was insufficient, and the spirit still lingered on the theatre of death. When peace returned a singular scene was enacted in many places, and chiefly round the high gorges of Lotoanuu, where the struggle was long centred and the loss had been severe. Kinswomen of the dead came carrying a <b>mat</b> or <b>sheet</b> and guided by survivors of the fight. The place of death was earnestly sought out; the sheet was spread upon the ground; and the women, moved with pious anxiety, sat about and watched it. If any living thing alighted it was twice brushed away; upon the third coming it was known to be the spirit of the dead, was folded in, carried home and buried beside the body; and the aitu rested. The rite was practised beyond doubt in simple piety; the repose of the soul was its object: its motive, reverent affection. The present king disowns indeed all knowledge of a dangerous aitu; he declares the souls of the unburied were only wanderers in limbo, lacking an entrance to the proper country of the dead, unhappy, nowise hurtful. And this severely classic opinion doubtless represents the views of the enlightened. But the flight of my Lafaele marks the grosser terrors of the ignorant.|$|R
40|$|Sandwich panels made of thin polymer {{composite}} materials {{have been developed}} and characterized as an alternative material to the mild steel sheet sheets conventionally used as face sheet materials [outer cover] for refrigerator, washing machine, and in automotive appliances like automobile, boat etc. In this paper sandwich panel made of Glass Chopped Strand <b>Mat</b> (GCSM) face <b>sheets</b> with polyester foam Coremat XM, polyester foam Coremat Xi and jute are fabricated. Flexural behavior of sandwich panel is studied. Theoretical results of sandwich panel is compared with 0. 8 mm M.

40|$|In {{most of the}} {{practical}} applications, reinforced soils are obtained by incorporating continuous reinforcement inclusions (for example, strip, bar, <b>sheet,</b> <b>mat</b> or net) within a soil mass in a definite pattern. The reinforcing mechanisms for such reinforced soils have been explained in different forms in the literature since the first modern form of soil reinforcement developed by Henry Vidal in 1966. In the past three decades, randomly distributed fiber-reinforced soil mechanisms have also been studied extensively suggesting a new emerging market for them in geotechnical engineering applications. It is timely to critically review the basic concepts of soil reinforcement, considering different types of reinforcement inclusions. In this review, reinforced soils are classified into two main groups: systematically reinforced soil, and randomly distributed fiber reinforced soil. It is emphasized that a single reinforcing mechanism cannot be used to explain the behavior of all reinforced soils, in fact, it is highly dependent {{on the type of}} reinforcement inclusions; however, the basic concept of soil reinforcement remains the same for all types of reinforcement...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{developing}} suitable materials and techniques {{for the elimination}} of hand backing of mats was undertaken. A thermosetting resin of the resorcinol type, ad-mixed with 15 to 25 per cent short-fiber asbestos, was applied to the mats both as a paste and {{in the form of a}} partially cured resin sheet. Its use was discontinued since its inherent insulating properties and warpage were found to be undesirable. After experimenting with several other backing materials and methods, the following procedure was concluded to be feasible: (1) Spraying sodium silicate solution upon a sheet of blotting paper. (2) Pressing the glue-coated blotting paper to the mat during the pressing of the mat upon the chase. (3) Warming to set the glue. (4) Sanding excess blotting paper off high portion of mat back. (5) Final drying in 2 ̆ 2 Sta-hi 2 ̆ 2 vacuum driers. A sanding unit was designed and constructed to remove the backing from the raised portions of the mat.

40|$|In {{order to}} add more {{economic}} value to chicken feather, a waste material of the poultry industry, it has been researched to incorporate chicken feather fibre (CFF) into resin to produce value-added composites. In the present research, chicken feather fibre was separated from the rachises and used to produce fibre mats. Then fibre mats were incorporated into polylactic acid (PLA) to make composites with low thermal conductivity. The procedure for making chicken feather fibre mat using an automatic dynamic sheet former was explored. Two different composite fabrication methods were investigated. One involved fabricate composite samples by hot pressing chicken feather fibre <b>mats</b> with PLA <b>sheet.</b> The other involved making composite specimens by hot pressing PLA powder and chicken feather fibre mats. A decrease in tensile strength compared to PLA had been expected before composite specimen fabricating according to previous research and so alkali treated fibre mats were used to improve tensile strength of composites. It was concluded that chicken feather fibre mats with uniform quality could be made by controlling the jet-to-spin ratio and water wall thickness of the dynamic sheet former cylinder. Stable mat/PLA composites could be fabricated by hot pressing chicken feather fibre mats with PLA powder. Results from tensile testing indicated that alkali treatment could improve tensile strength to a small degree. SEM image analysis revealed that poor interfacial bonding between fibre barbs and PLA matrix had occurred. Thermal conductivity testing demonstrated improved thermal insulation with addition of CFF to PLA...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{techniques}} have emerged that allow rapid prototyping of sheet metal 3 D parts. These techniques {{do not use}} dedicated tooling and are {{in a good position}} to become more flexible, cheaper and also faster than conventional sheet metal forming techniques. Among the most promis ing processes in the sheet metal rapid prototyping group are Incremental Forming and Laser Forming. Besides its limited process window, the main problem with Incremental Forming is its accuracy, while for Laser Formi ng it is the lack of knowledge concerning 3 D shaping. The research in this work includes the experimental testing and validati on of flexible, laser-based sheet metal rapid prototyping techniques: La ser Forming using high power, industrial laser types and a variant of in cremental forming, namely Laser Assisted Single Point Incremental Formin g (LASPIF). The section on Laser Forming will first deepen the available knowledge c oncerning 2 D forming. 2 D forming is in fact a thermo-mechanical variant of air bending and it introduces an approximate 2 D stress-state during s canning along a sufficiently long (straight) scan path. Among others, th e dependency of the bending angle on the geometry of the test sample and the radius of the bend have been investigated more closely. 3 D forming, on the other hand, creates a more complex stress state in the <b>sheet</b> <b>mat</b> erial and not only out-of-plane deformations, but also in-plane deformat ions are necessary to give the part its final shape. The research scope covers both fundamental and applied research aspects, oriented towards i ndustrial applicability of the process. This includes scanning close to free edges, shrink flanging of flat shapes that have been cut out, but a lso the creation of ventilation louvres and stretch flanging to obtain s unk holes in flat surrounding sheet material. The limits of 3 D laser for ming of non-developable shapes have been explored, leading to the conclu sion that indeed the capabilities to form such shapes using laser formin g are limited to shallow double curved surfaces that are still close to developability. In the section on laser forming, also a CAD/CAM procedur e to form developable surfaces has been elaborated and tested on two dif ferent geometries. Even when taking into account the limitations of laser forming, this doc toral thesis brings the process closer to industrial applicability: job shops that have an industrial CO 2 laser cutting platform could think of extending the cutting operations with (limited) forming possibilities. In the section on Laser Assisted Single Point Incremental Forming an app ropriate set-up has been described. Using this test equipment, the resul ts show that the technique is effective as the accuracy is improved in c omparison with SPIF. Moreover, the process forces are reduced and the fo rmability in terms of achievable radial strain is significantly increase d, which allows to form materials known for their limited formability. F inally, the residual material properties after LASPIF have been investig ated. status: publishe...|$|R
