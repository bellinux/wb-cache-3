5|$|After this success, he {{was sent}} to Asia Minor, where the Turkish raids on the Byzantine borderlands had become a menace, and where Turkish {{settlers}} had begun encroaching upon imperial territory. He remained there until 1267 and achieved some success, securing the lands around the valley of the Maeander River and restoring the defences of the region. The historian George Pachymeres certainly praised his conduct of these operations, and alleged that the mere <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> approach caused fear to his enemies.|$|E
5|$|Burnett {{took his}} seat in the 37th Congress; sources make no <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> making good on his threat {{not to take the}} oath of office. Just days after the First Battle of Bull Run, Burnett's fellow Kentuckian, John J. Crittenden {{proposed}} a resolution blaming the war on the disloyal Southerners and defining the war's aim as preservation of the Union without interference in the rights or institutions of the states. Burnett asked that the question be divided. His request was granted, but he only found one colleague willing to vote with him against blaming Southerners for the war.|$|E
5|$|By 1445 Richard {{had become}} a knight, {{probably}} at Margaret of Anjou's coronation on 22April that year. He is visible in the historical record of service of King Henry VI in 1449, which makes <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> services in a grant. He performed military service in the north with his father, and might have taken part {{in the war against}} Scotland in 1448–1449. When Richard, Duke of York, unsuccessfully rose up against the king in 1452, both Warwick and his father rallied to the side of King Henry VI.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the Civil War, Burnett sought an audience with President Andrew Johnson, an old congressional colleague, but Johnson told him to go home. Burnett was indicted for treason at Louisville, but released on bond and never prosecuted. He partnered with Judge John R. Grace and resumed the practice of law in Cadiz. He died of cholera in Hopkinsville on September 28, 1866. Initially buried in the Old Cadiz Cemetery, he was moved to the East End Cemetery in Cadiz. His tombstone bears no <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Confederate service.|$|E
5|$|However, as {{happened}} to many prominent {{individuals in the}} Athenian democracy, Themistocles's fellow citizens grew jealous of his success, and possibly tired of his boasting. It is probable that in early 479 BC, Themistocles was stripped of his command; instead, Xanthippus was to command the Athenian fleet, and Aristides the land forces. Though Themistocles was no doubt politically and militarily active {{for the rest of}} the campaign, no <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> activities in 479 BC is made in the ancient sources. In the summer of that year, after receiving an Athenian ultimatum, the Peloponnesians finally agreed to assemble an army and march to confront Mardonius, who had reoccupied Athens in June. At the decisive Battle of Plataea, the Allies destroyed the Persian army, while apparently on the same day, the Allied navy destroyed the remnants of the Persian fleet at the Battle of Mycale. These twin victories completed the Allied triumph, and ended the Persian threat to Greece.|$|E
5|$|Urse {{earned a}} {{reputation}} for extortion and financial exactions. During the reign of William II, he was considered {{second only to the}} king's minister Ranulf Flambard in his rapacity. The first <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> exactions is in Hemming's Cartulary. Further details were given by the medieval chroniclers William of Malmesbury and Gerald of Wales, both of whom relate Ealdred's curse. His exactions were also mentioned in Domesday Book, where an entry in the survey for Gloucestershire noted that his oppression prevented the inhabitants of Sodbury so much that they were unable to pay their customary rents. He intimidated the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter into granting him a lease of two of their estates, Greenhill and Eastbury. Urse was one of a new breed of royal official, one who was not opposed to royal power but rather welcomed it, as it helped his own position.|$|E
50|$|Details about Sherlock Holmes's life, {{except for}} the adventures in the books, are scarce in Conan Doyle's {{original}} stories. Nevertheless, <b>mentions</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> early life and extended family paint a loose biographical picture of the detective.|$|R

5|$|During the 16th century, Josquin {{gradually}} {{acquired the}} {{reputation as the}} greatest composer of the age, his mastery of technique and expression universally imitated and admired. Writers as diverse as Baldassare Castiglione and Martin Luther wrote about his reputation and fame; theorists such as Heinrich Glarean and Gioseffo Zarlino held his style as that best representing perfection. He was so admired that many anonymous compositions were attributed to him by copyists, probably to increase their sales. More than 370 works are attributed to him; {{it was only after}} the advent of modern analytical scholarship that some of these attributions were challenged, and revealed as mistaken, on the basis of stylistic features and manuscript evidence. Yet in spite of Josquin's colossal reputation, which endured until the beginning of the Baroque era and was revived in the 20th century, his biography is shadowy, and virtually nothing is known about his personality. The only surviving work which may be in his own hand is a graffito {{on the wall of the}} Sistine Chapel, and only one contemporary <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> character is known, in a letter to Duke Ercole I of Ferrara. The lives of dozens of less revered Renaissance composers are better documented than that of Josquin.|$|E
25|$|Pleasants, {{who had no}} role in {{the battle}} itself, {{received}} praise for his idea and the execution thereof. When he was appointed a brevet brigadier general on March 13, 1865, the citation made explicit <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> role.|$|E

50|$|Hossain’s {{personal}} life is contributory to his scientific activities {{in such a}} way that the Journal of Loss and Trauma published his partial autobiography Abstinence: A Memoir in 2011 to reflect how psychological traumas taught and helped him learning to cope. In that article, Hossain, <b>mentioned</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> elder son Mohammad Seeyam Samir's death as the strongest motivation for his researches on death anxiety. He also <b>mentioned</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> anticipatory fear about his parents - Md Manjur Hossain and Rezia Begum's death in unknown future as another motivational factor from his early childhood; both of them eventually died before 2015. It ultimately compelled him to learn and theorise how to adjust to the phenomenon of death of the loved ones. Hossain is married to Tahmina Rahman Chowdhury. They have another son, Mohammad Raiyan Samir.|$|R

25|$|There is no {{information}} about Sallust's parents or family, except for Tacitus' <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sister. The Sallustii were a provincial noble family of Sabine origin. They belonged to the equestrian order and had full Roman citizenship. During the Social War Gaius' parents hid in Rome, because Amiternum was under threat of siege by rebelling Italic tribes. Because of this Sallust could have been raised in Rome He received a very good education.|$|E
25|$|Within each diocese, {{even if the}} Eucharist {{is celebrated}} by another bishop, the {{necessary}} communion with the Bishop of the diocese is signified by the <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> name.

25|$|He soon {{clashed with}} the more {{conservative}} politicians who had been members of the PNR. In March 1930, the <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> name during a public celebration provoked a number of Romanian Army generals to leave in protest; immediately after, the National Liberal group around Vintilă Brătianu began attacking Stere's party for harbouring him, and for causing a split between Army and political establishment. General Henry Cihoschi, the Minister of Defense, was publicly criticized in parliament for not siding with his subordinates, and had to resign on April 4; Maniu appeared to support Stere's ousting.|$|E
25|$|It is {{uncertain}} when Cole Younger {{and his brothers}} joined Clement's gang. The first <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> involvement came in 1868, when authorities identified him {{as a member of}} a gang who robbed Nimrod Long & Co., a bank in Russellville, Kentucky. Former guerrillas John Jarrett (Younger's brother-in-law), Arthur McCoy, and George and Oliver Shepard were also implicated. Oliver Shepard was killed resisting arrest and George was imprisoned. Once the more senior members of the gang had been killed, captured, or quit, its core thereafter consisted of the Younger brothers and Frank and Jesse James.|$|E

Luxița was shielded by her brothers in the Kingdom of Hungary, without informing Nicolae of her whereabouts or her pregnancy, until after she delivered. Bonifaciu was thus born in Pest; his date of birth is variously given as May 14, May 17, or May 27. In July, he was baptized into Orthodoxy at a Pest chapel shared by the Greek and Romanian Orthodox churches.
