40|$|What does a {{practicing}} policy analyst {{need to know}} about using <b>models</b> <b>that</b> incorporate uncertainty? One could write volumes focusing only on <b>models</b> <b>that</b> produce specific numeric forecasts (as opposed to conceptual <b>models</b> <b>that</b> address uncertainty qualitatively). But in the 21 st century sound bites are more useful. In short: The world is uncertain; but sampling variability isn’t the driver; and so there is no excuse not to simulate. The real challenge, though, is to communicate effectively about <b>models</b> <b>that</b> incorporate uncertainty...|$|R

5|$|Unlike most North American institutions, the University of Toronto is a collegiate {{university}} with a <b>model</b> <b>that</b> resembles {{those of}} the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford in Britain. The colleges hold substantial autonomy over admissions, scholarships, programs and other academic and financial affairs, {{in addition to the}} housing and social duties of typical residential colleges. The system emerged in the 19th century, as ecclesiastical colleges considered various forms of union with the University of Toronto to ensure their viability.

5|$|It {{can also}} be seen however that this simple 2-dimensional model, {{essentially}} an inverted pendulum on a turntable, predicts that the steady-state turn is unstable. If the bike is displaced slightly downwards from its equilibrium lean angle, the torque of gravity increases, that of centrifugal force decreases and the displacement gets amplified. A more-sophisticated <b>model</b> <b>that</b> allows a wheel to steer, adjust the path, and counter the torque of gravity, is necessary to capture the self-stability observed in real bikes.|$|E

40|$|Appropriate test <b>models</b> <b>that</b> can satisfy complex {{constraints}} {{are required}} for testing model management programs {{in order to build}} confidence in their correctness. Models have inherently complex structures and are often required to satisfy non-trivial constraints which makes them time consuming, labour intensive and error prone to construct manually. Automated capabilities are therefore required, however, existing fully-automated model generation tools cannot generate <b>models</b> <b>that</b> satisfy arbitrarily complex constraints. This thesis addresses this problem by proposing a semi-automated approach towards the generation of such models. A new framework named Epsilon <b>Model</b> Generator (EMG) <b>that</b> implements this approach is presented.
