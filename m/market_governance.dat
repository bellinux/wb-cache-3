50|$|Significantly, the Kyoto Protocol offers {{participating}} countries three market based mechanisms as means to meeting their binding emissions reduction targets. These are 'emissions trading' (known as “the carbon market"), 'the clean development mechanism' (CDM) and 'joint implementation' (JI). The three Kyoto market mechanisms {{have been identified}} as forms of carbon <b>market</b> <b>governance,</b> a market based form of climate governance. Carbon <b>market</b> <b>governance</b> allows carbon emissions in one place to be exchanged with emissions reductions in another. It relies on measuring, monitoring and verification techniques to commensurate carbon, allowing seemingly disparate activities to appear on the same balance sheet.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{implications}} for upgrading of integration into two distinct clothing value chains in Lesotho and Swaziland [...] the value chain characterised by Taiwanese investment and feeding into the US market under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the value chain characterised by South African investment and feeding into the South African market. These value chains differ with regard to ownership patterns, end <b>markets,</b> <b>governance</b> structures, retailers' demands, and investors' motivations. These different characteristics have crucial impacts on upgrading possibilities, including functional, process and 'local' upgrading. Thus, {{from the perspective of}} upgrading and sustainability, ownership patterns, local embeddedness and market diversification matter. The emergence of South Africa as an alternative end market and the different value chain dynamics operating in the South African retailer-governed value chain opens up new opportunities from those of the AGOA/Taiwanese-dominated value chain. global value chains, GVCs, foreign direct investment, FDI, market diversification, African Growth and Opportunity Act, AGOA, apparel industry, clothing industry, garment industry, Sub-Saharan Africa, SSA, value chain dynamics, local embeddedness, upgrading, Lesotho, Swaziland, apparel value chains, South Africa, ownership patterns, end <b>markets,</b> <b>governance</b> structures, retailer demands, investor motivation,...|$|R

MGMs could provide economic signals or incentives, for example in pricing externalities. Regulatory mechanisms could prohibit or require certain practices by consumers or producers.

While representing what is classed as a “market-based instrument”, in that it represents an economic incentive to manage carbon usage more effectively, the CCL is not what is understood as <b>market</b> <b>governance.</b> This is because CCL is not representative of the market steering actors in their carbon behaviour, but the government imposing a sanction to govern behaviour, which is constitutive of hierarchical governance.|$|E

50|$|Emissions trading {{constitutes}} a massive part of carbon governance in England. While {{it has been}} argued that this is an attempt to allow markets to govern carbon emissions by incentivising their proper management and allowing them to be traded and priced by supply and demand, the hierarchical influence of the governmental institutions, the EU and DECC, are still evident and prevent emissions trading in England in its current form being considered <b>market</b> <b>governance.</b> There are two emissions trading systems operating in England at this present moment, and the way in which they are governed is emblematic of the hierarchical nature of carbon governance at the national level.|$|E

These case studies demonstrate that in order to achieve and maintain the sustainability of community-based tourism programs the presence of tourism associations and cooperatives that fomented initiatives of cooperation and institutionalization has been vital. Due to the complexity and existing variables that are both implicit and linked with tourism activities in communities, this article also provides suggestions to increase the adoption of local strategies that involve the community in tourism development and implementation, whereas working with local tourism chain can provide better results.

It postulates that for securities markets to thrive and deepen, countries must endeavor to create appropriate legal and institutional arrangements. Part II is an elucidation of the legal structures on securities markets and the financial services sector in Kenya. From the discussion, {{it is clear that}} the framework is characterized by gaps, duplications, inconsistencies and restrictions on investment. More importantly, there has never been a comprehensive approach to the promotion of financial services in Kenya. Part III examines the institutional arrangements and assesses their contribution to the enhancement of securities markets. Evidently, the multiplicity of regulatory bodies has not endeared the securities markets and there is need for reforms.

Lee authored and edited fourteen books, including one on Post Keynesian Price Theory (1998) and a second on A History of Heterodox Economics (2009). He published fifty-six articles and over a hundred book chapters, book entries, book reviews, and notes of one sort or another.|$|E

5000|$|For the LSR, the Depression was the inexorable {{result of}} laissez-faire {{philosophy}}. This philosophy had spread since the Act of Union in 1840, which began {{a transition from}} power structures that favoured aristocracy to structures that favoured business. Responsible government arrived shortly after the union, and shifted influence from the governor to ministers. Powers {{that had previously been}} focused in the governor, became divided among ministers. No meaningful administrative structures were implemented to ensure that ministers remained responsive to the public, and ministers aligned themselves with capitalists. Free <b>market</b> <b>governance</b> became the consort of free market capitalization. Legislation regulating conflicts of interest did not exist, and politicians worked openly with business. One former prime minister made the marriage of business with politics strikingly clear when he stated [...] "my politics are railroads."

It is about the relationship between places – in terms of the economy, labour <b>market</b> and <b>governance.</b> As Britain has moved further away from its position as one of the world’s industrial powerhouses, people and places have had to adapt to new social and economic requirements. In particular, increasingly open local economies raise questions about how a growing network of links between places alter the role and identity of former industrial areas. This question is closely bound up with key contemporary policy issues. These include geographical disparities in welfare and productivity, the uneven operation of the labour <b>market,</b> the <b>governance</b> of economic development, and the competing claims of ‘city regions’ on the one hand and ‘regions’ and ‘sub-regions’ on the other as the appropriate arena for sub-national policymaking...|$|R
