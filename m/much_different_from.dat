5|$|Bupropion, {{when used}} for {{treating}} obesity {{over a period}} of 6 to 12 months, may result in weight loss of 2.7kg over placebo. This is not <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the weight loss produced by several other medications, such as sibutramine or orlistat. It has been studied in combination with naltrexone. Concerns from bupropion include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. In September 2014, a combination (bupropion/naltrexone) was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of obesity.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of zduhaći was not <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> that of ordinary people, {{but they had}} some traits that set them apart. They were deep sleepers, very hard to wake up, often drowsy, pensive, thoughtful, and solemn. Their faces were often puffy, eyes shadowy. They were wise and shrewd, successful in whatever {{they were doing and}} resourceful in dealing with problems; their households were prosperous. In Semberija, zduhaći were said to be good scapulimantic diviners, {{and to be able to}} communicate with domestic animals. The clan of Paštrovići from Montenegrin Littoral claimed that the zduhaći could hear any doings anywhere in the world; if someone stepped on a zduhać's foot, they could hear that too. The clan of Kuči held that the zduhaći were outstanding long jumpers.|$|E
5|$|The {{books are}} based on the vampire myth, but Twilight vampires differ in a number of {{particulars}} from the general vampire lore. For instance, Twilight vampires have strong piercing teeth rather than fangs; they glitter in sunlight rather than burn; and they can drink animal as well as human blood. Meyer comments that her vampire mythology differs from that of other authors because she wasn't informed about the canon vampires, saying, It wasn't until I knew that Twilight would be published that I began to think about whether my vampires were too much the same or too <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the others. Of course, I was far too invested in my characters at that point to be making changes... so I didn't cut out fangs and coffins and so forth as a way to distinguish my vampires; that's just how they came to me.|$|E
50|$|The Wake is {{the second}} solo album by Scott Kelly from Neurosis. It is largely {{acoustic}} guitar music which is <b>much</b> <b>different</b> stylistically <b>from</b> the output of his primary band.|$|R
5000|$|Adler earns Holmes' {{unbounded}} admiration. When the King of Bohemia says, [...] "Would she {{not have}} made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity she was not on my level?" [...] Holmes replies scathingly that Adler is indeed on a <b>much</b> <b>different</b> level <b>from</b> the King.|$|R
50|$|Jose soon tracked Tarot to {{the castle}} {{headquarters}} of Despero, Morgana Le Fey and the villain known as Enigma. He and Hawkman infiltrated the castle and spend days fighting through its denizens, as time and space were <b>much</b> <b>different</b> inside <b>from</b> outside. They rescued Tarot from a trio of stone monsters.|$|R
5|$|The new Girlschool, now a five-piece group, {{signed with}} the PolyGram American {{subsidiary}} Mercury Records, once home of the American all-girls rock band The Runaways. The label saw in the band an opportunity to produce a rival for chart-winning female-fronted bands like Heart and Lita Ford and pushed {{the music of the}} band even more towards FM friendly American hard rock. The band was paired with producer Nick Tauber, who had produced the first albums of Thin Lizzy and the most successful albums of Toyah and Marillion, contributing also to the launch of the British glam metal act Girl. The resulting album Running Wild, sported ten keyboard-laden tracks <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Girlschool’s most successful music. The record label decided to release the album only in the USA in February 1985, but actually gave little support to its marketing. The review of the magazine Kerrang! reflects the opinions of Dufort and McAuliffe, which described years later the album as rubbish or even worse. Running Wild had insignificant sales on the US market, not representing the breakthrough the band and the label had hoped for. A live performance of Girlschool as a quintet at Camden Palace in London was taped for the VHS Play Dirty Live, which was released in 1985 and reissued on DVD with the title Live from London in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The Thai Lisu {{traditional}} costume {{shown here}} is <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the main Lisu traditional costume being {{widely used in}} Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan, China and Putao, Danai, Myitkyina, Northern Myanmar.|$|E
25|$|The 1984 US Open had Evert {{taking on}} Navratilova for the third-time in a slam final in the season, This result was not <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the other three, only it took Navratilova three-sets {{to put away}} Evert in 46, 64, 64 fashion.|$|E
5000|$|... 1-2-3 had a <b>much</b> <b>different</b> sound <b>from</b> the {{previous}} band, or from {{almost any other}} band at that time. After achieving little success in Scotland, the band moved to London, England where they hoped that their original music would catch on, but early audiences were confused {{by the lack of}} a guitarist.|$|R
50|$|It is <b>much</b> <b>different</b> in {{appearance}} <b>from</b> the common mudpuppy which is gray to brown, with round blue-black spots. The Red River mudpuppy is light yellowish brown {{with a white}} stripe {{on either side of}} the middorsal area.|$|R

25|$|Some of Canis's chansons use a cantus-firmus technique, {{in which}} Canis takes a line {{or two of}} music from a {{pre-existing}} chanson, including examples by Janequin, Claudin de Sermisy, and Gombert, and reworks it in a contrapuntal texture <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the original, but using the same words.|$|E
25|$|Media {{are more}} similar than {{different}} – Psychologically speaking, a computer is not <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> a television and a sophisticated {{version of a}} technology is remarkably similar to a simpler version of the technology. As Reeves and Nass (1996) say, “social and natural responses come from people, not from media themselves,” (p.252). In other words, the media does not make people react the way they do.|$|E
25|$|The {{maladministration}} of {{the first}} Audiencia continued until the return of Cortés in July 1530. The members of the Audiencia intended to depose Cortés, but were prevented {{by the actions of}} Bishop Zumárraga. Shortly thereafter, the members of the second Audiencia arrived, taking power in January 1531. The second Audiencia was <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the first, honest, capable and dedicated to good government and fair treatment of the Indigenous.|$|E
5000|$|The Lies We Tell Ourselves, is an {{extended}} play album by American rock band thelastplaceyoulook. It {{was released on}} May 30, 2006 and produced by John Glover and Marke Townsend. The first single is [...] "I've Got a Question for You ... Why Are You Still Here?". Space City Rock categorized the album as having a <b>much</b> <b>different</b> sound <b>from</b> the band's full-length follow up See The Light Inside You.|$|R
25|$|The album's {{recording}} was a <b>much</b> <b>different</b> affair <b>from</b> {{the first}} two—likely {{because of the}} band's constantly changing dynamic. The traditional country {{of the first two}} albums, especially Faithless, was largely replaced with a more sophisticated country-rooted pop sound, very similar to Wilco's 1999 album Summerteeth. Also adding to the different flavor of the album was a cast of guest stars, including The Replacements' Tommy Stinson and The Smashing Pumpkins' James Iha.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the hassle}} {{involved}} in producing an album under one's own label, the Ed Palermo Big Band did not release another album until a record company showed interest. This happened in 1987. Ping Pong {{was released by}} Pro Jazz Records and featured <b>much</b> <b>different</b> material <b>from</b> the first album This album featured less complicated music and more swing. From 1987-1993 the band alternated performing at the clubs Visiones and the Bitter End.|$|R
25|$|When the Corfu {{started to}} be {{imported}} {{into the rest of}} Europe in 1785, the communities adherent through Ashkenazi tradition to the Genoese variety were very skeptical about it. The Ashkenazim assumed that since the Greek is so <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the Genoese, it might have been grafted or hybridized. At the beginning of the 19th century, when the Yanova Esrog was ceased due to the battles of Napoleon I of France, it really started to dominate the market.|$|E
25|$|Successful {{training}} of owls is <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the {{training of}} hawks and falcons, as they are hearing- rather than sight-oriented (owls can only see black and white, and are long-sighted). This often leads falconers {{to believe that they}} are less intelligent, as they are distracted easily by new or unnatural noises and they do not respond as readily to food cues. However, if trained successfully, owls show intelligence on the same level as that of hawks and falcons.|$|E
25|$|Discovering {{that the}} Los Angeles Police Department {{was pleased with}} their special Kimber-made M1911 pistols, a single source request was issued to Kimber Manufacturing for a {{similarly}} built pistol, despite the imminent release of their TLE/RLII models. Kimber shortly began producing {{a limited number of}} what would be later termed the Interim Close Quarters Battle pistol (ICQB). Maintaining the simple recoil assembly, 5-inch barrel (though using a stainless steel match grade barrel), and internal extractor, the ICQB is not <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Browning's original design.|$|E

50|$|Originally, SR 5 {{north of}} Trenton {{followed}} a <b>much</b> <b>different</b> route <b>from</b> the current alignment. From Trenton, SR 5 bent to the northeast, following the old Dresden Road {{as far as}} Greenfield, where it turned north and roughly followed the present-day SR 43. As evidenced by road maps published by the National Map Company and Rand McNally, sometime between 1927 and 1935, SR 5 was rerouted to follow the former SR 41 north to Kenton and on to Union City.|$|R
50|$|Running {{concurrently}} {{with the}} mining {{boom in the}} Keweenaw was the white pine lumber boom. Trees were cut for timbers for mine shafts, to heat the communities around the large copper mines, and {{to help build a}} growing nation. Much of the logging at the time was done in winter due to the ease of operability with the snow. Due to the logging practices at that time, the forest of the Keweenaw looks <b>much</b> <b>different</b> today <b>from</b> 100 years ago.|$|R
25|$|The third {{bridge is}} <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> its two predecessors. It is a {{pre-stressed}} concrete structure {{with a central}} span of 160 metres and two side spans of 100 metres (including the approaches, it is a total of 897 metres long and 15.8 metres wide). It can carry abnormal loads of up to 400 tonnes, and has a life expectancy of 120 years. It was constructed by Edmund Nuttall Ltd to a design by Mott, Hay and Anderson's young engineer, Alan Yiu Lun Wan.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{their common}} origins, {{the economy of}} socialist Yugoslavia was <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the economies of the Soviet Union and other Eastern European {{communist}} countries, especially after the Yugoslav–Soviet break-up of 1948. Though ultimately owned by the state, Yugoslav companies were collectively managed by the employees themselves, much like in the Israeli kibbutz and the anarchist industrial cooperatives of Revolutionary Catalonia. The occupation and liberation struggle in World War II left Yugoslavia's infrastructure devastated. Even the most developed {{parts of the country}} were largely rural, and the little industry the country had was largely damaged or destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate about}} the nature of the mind is {{relevant}} to the development of artificial intelligence. If the mind is indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain, then hypothetically it would be much more difficult to recreate within a machine, if it were possible at all. If, on the other hand, the mind is no more than the aggregated functions of the brain, then it will be possible to create a machine with a recognisable mind (though possibly only with computers <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> today's), by simple virtue of the fact that such a machine already exists in the form of the human brain.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in a <b>much</b> <b>different</b> way <b>from</b> Queen's other studio albums. In early 1991, having completed work on Innuendo, and some months before his death, Freddie Mercury recorded as many vocals as he could, with the instruction {{to the rest of}} the band (Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon) to complete the songs later. Put to tape during this time were primarily [...] "A Winter's Tale", [...] "Mother Love" [...] and what would eventually become [...] "You Don't Fool Me".|$|R
50|$|Shaded Pain is {{the fourth}} studio album by the American rock band Lifesavers Underground, {{released}} in 1987 on Frontline Records. A <b>much</b> <b>different</b> effort <b>from</b> their other releases before or since, Shaded Pain took a darker gothic rock direction from their previous pop punk sound, and features bleak, death-obsessed lyrics. Although misunderstood by many critics at the time, the album has attained a status of a cult classic. Later, the critics consider the album to be the band's finest effort {{and one of the}} best albums of the year it was released.|$|R
5000|$|Complete Surround/All {{speakers}} {{are treated}} equally - Instead of following the traditional ways of mixing in stereo, this much more liberal approach lets the mix engineer {{do anything he}} or she wants. Instruments can appear to originate from anywhere, or even spin around the listener. When done appropriately and with taste, interesting sonic experiences can be achieved, {{as was the case}} with James Guthrie's 5.1 mix of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, albeit with input from the band. This is a <b>much</b> <b>different</b> mix <b>from</b> the 1970s quadrophonic mix.|$|R
25|$|Wine expert Tom Stevenson {{describes}} the classic profile of Sancerre blanc as bone dry, highly aromatic with intense flavors of peaches and gooseberries. He describes Sancerre rouge as being light to medium bodied with floral aromas and delicate flavors. The Pinot noir based rosés {{are described as}} dry and light bodied with raspberry and strawberry notes. Other wine experts such as Jancis Robinson and Hugh Johnson note {{that in recent years}} overproduction has introduced a lot of variable quality with some Sancerre blancs producing flavor profiles that are not that <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> generic Sauvignon de Touraine from the Middle Loire, though this varies depending on the producer and overall quality of the vintage.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet {{meaning of}} {{military}} doctrine was <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> U.S. military {{usage of the}} term. Soviet Minister of Defence Marshal Grechko defined it in 1975 as 'a system of views {{on the nature of}} war and methods of waging it, and on the preparation of the country and army for war, officially adopted in a given state and its armed forces.' Soviet theorists emphasised both the political and 'military-technical' sides of military doctrine, while from the Soviet point of view, Westerners ignored the political side. According to Harriet F Scott and William Scott, the political side of Soviet military doctrine, best explained the international moves that the Soviet Union undertook during the cold war.|$|E
25|$|A second {{explanation}} {{issued by}} Janssen and Vanhamme {{is that of}} reciprocal altruism. This is a key concept in evolutionary psychology that is argued to fuel all human behaviour: people only do something {{if they can get}} something back in return. In the case of CSR and ethical consumerism, however, consumers get very little in return for their investment. Ethically sourced or manufactured products are typically higher in price due to greater costs. However, the reward for consumers is not <b>much</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> that of a non-ethical counterpart. Therefore, evolutionary speaking making an ethical purchase is not worth the higher cost to the individual even if they believe in supporting ethically, environmentally and socially beneficial causes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{solution}} {{structure of}} the Eps 15 homology (EH) domain of a human POB 1 (partner of RalBP 1) has been determined by uniform 13 C/ 15 N labeling and heteronuclear multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The POB 1 EH domain consists of two EF-hand structures, and the second one binds a calcium ion. In the calcium-bound state, {{the orientation of the}} fourth α-helix relative to the other helices of the POB 1 EH domain is slightly <b>different</b> <b>from</b> that of calbindin, and <b>much</b> more <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those of calmodulin and troponin C, {{on the basis of their}} atomic coordinates...|$|R
50|$|As to the Moroccan and Yemenite citrons he argued, that {{although}} there were no grafted trees ever discovered among those kinds, they should be unfit, {{in light of the}} differentiation from the Ashkenazi types. The Moroccan citron is allegedly noted for its seedlessness, and the Yemenite for its pulplessness, both are too <b>much</b> <b>different</b> in morphology <b>from</b> the traditional Yanova and Israeli esrogs.|$|R
50|$|According to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle of March 3, 1858, the Second Unitarian Church was {{designed}} in the Anglo-Italian style (original for its time), and it was <b>much</b> <b>different</b> in appearance <b>from</b> other churches in the neighborhood. The building was eighty-six feet long and seventy-five feet wide in the transept. The nave was forty feet wide and the transept - thirty-five.|$|R
