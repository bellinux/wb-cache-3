50|$|CFS {{not only}} {{successfully}} suppresses images, but it strengthens {{the depth and}} duration of suppression compared to previous methods, such as flash suppression and binocular rivalry. CFS has the highest magnitude of suppression and allows researchers to increase the suppression time of an image tenfold. Using this <b>method,</b> <b>subjects</b> may report an image presented in their visual field as being invisible for over three minutes. CFS has the longest suppression time compared to other methods. CFS {{opens the door to}} studying preconscious processing mechanisms involved in visual perception.|$|E
5000|$|Behavioral {{measures}} of primary consciousness {{can be either}} objective or subjective. Regarding objective measures, knowledge is unconscious if it expresses itself in an indirect test. For example, the ability to pick which item might come next in a series can indicate unconscious knowledge of regularities in sequences. [...] "Strategic control measures" [...] use a person's ability to deliberately use or not use knowledge according to instructions. If they use information despite intentions not to use it, it indicates unconscious knowledge. Post-decision wagering can also be used. In this <b>method,</b> <b>subjects</b> make a first-order discrimination (i.e. a choice) and then place a wager regarding {{the outcome of the}} discrimination. Some scientists view this as a direct and objective measure of consciousness, and it can be used with children and animals. However, this method has been argued to be subjective and indirect.|$|E

50|$|In {{the pure}} study trial (pure ST condition) method, both items {{of a pair}} were {{presented}} simultaneously for study. In the test trial/study trial (TTST condition) <b>method,</b> <b>subjects</b> attempted to retrieve the response term during {{a period in which}} only the stimulus term was present (and the response term of the pair was presented after a 5-sec delay). Final retention of target items was tested with cued-recall tests. In Experiment 1, there was a reliable advantage in final testing for nonsense-syllable/number pairs in the TTST condition over pairs in the pure ST condition. In Experiment 2, the same result was obtained with Eskimo/English word pairs. This benefit of the TTST condition was not apparently different for final retrieval after 5 min or after 24 h. Experiments 3 and 4 ruled out two artifactual explanations of the TTST advantage observed in the first two experiments. Because performing a memory retrieval (TTST condition) led to better performance than pure study (pure ST condition), the results reject the hypothesis that a successful retrieval is beneficial {{only to the extent that}} it provides another study experience.|$|E

40|$|Pre-service {{programs}} for secondary teachers have traditionally involved <b>method</b> <b>subjects,</b> where participants are {{inducted into the}} curriculum practices of two disciplinary or subject areas. In 2003, Victoria University of Technology, Melbourne, enrolled {{a small group of}} fourteen pre-service teachers into an innovative Graduate Diploma of Secondary Education that directly challenged these program assumptions. <b>Method</b> <b>subjects</b> were collapsed into an integrated study of the theory, skills and practices of classroom work and connections were drawn between all enrolled subjects or knowledge. Another key feature of the program involved all pre-service teachers being placed at the one school for their partnership experience, including classroom teaching and a requirement to undertake an applied curriculum project negotiated as being important for the school. Mentor teachers from the school presented a series of evening tutorials on issues such as systemic requirements, curriculum innovation and school organization. This approach to site-based teacher education builds on a project funded by Department of Education, Science and Technology and conducted by Victoria University some years ago. The paper describes the evaluation of the program and suggests some curriculum changes and the resources required. It also provides some advice for the establishment of similar site-based work that attempts to break the mould of traditional thinking on separated knowledge in teacher education...|$|E
