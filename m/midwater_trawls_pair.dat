40|$|IN ADDITION TO the fishes {{and faster}} {{swimming}} invertebrates (euphausiids, squids) usually ob-tained in <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> collections, relatively large species of copepods are also frequently captured. Aside from Sewell's (1929) report of copepods found in six midwater collections {{made in the}} Ind ian Ocean, it has only been {{in recent years that}} midwate r trawl samples have been more or less systematically analyzed for copepods. From the Florida Current, off Miami, an area in which the copepods have been stud ied fairly extensively, Owre and Foyo (1964) re-ported that 21 calanoid species were found only in collections made by the Isaacs-Kidd <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> (Isaacs and Kidd, 1953). Of these, 11 represented new records for the area. In the southwestern Indian Ocean, De Decker and Mombeck (1965) using both vertical plankton net and <b>midwater</b> fish <b>trawl</b> found 274 species of copepods. Of these the fish trawl accounted for 115 species including 43 which were not found in the plankton net collections. In the western Indian Ocean Grice and Hulsemann (1967) studied a series of 30 plankton net and 21 <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> collections obtained between 18 °N and 40 0 S. In the <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> col-lections were found 64 species not present in the plankton net collections, including representa-tives of all eight species of the family Mega-calanidae.

40|$|An {{improved}} backstepping {{control method}} for three-dimensional trajectory tracking of a <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> system is investigated. A new mathematical {{model of the}} trawl system while considering the horizontal expansion effect of two otter boards is presented based on the Newton Euler method. Subsequently, an active path tracking strategy of the trawl system based on the backstepping method is proposed. The nonstrict feedback characteristic of the proposed model employs a control allocation method and several parallel nonlinear PID (Proportion Integration Differentiation) controllers to eliminate the high-order state variables. Then, the stability analysis by the Lyapunov Stability Theory shows that the proposed controller can maintain {{the stability of the}} trawl system even with the presence of external disturbances. To validate the proposed controller, a simulation comparison with a linear PID controller was conducted.

40|$|Like {{several other}} fishes in the pelagic {{community}} of the upper San Francisco Estuary, age- 0 striped bass Morone saxatilis have shown a major decline based on a <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> sampling pro-gram that has been conducted for over 40 years. We hypothesized that the apparent decline in age- 0 striped bass might be partially attributable to a behavioral shift away from the channels sampled by the trawls. We {{found no evidence of}} an upstream–downstream shift in age- 0 distribution. Instead, age- 0 striped bass distribu-tion remains closely associated with the low-salinity zone of the estuary. However, the survey data suggest a substantial long-term distribution shift away from channels and toward shoal areas.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Trawls {{are used}} {{extensively}} during fisheries abundance surveys to derive estimates of fish density and, {{in the case}} of acoustic-based surveys, to identify acoustically sampled fish populations. However, trawls are selective in what fish they retain, resulting in biased estimates of density, species, and size compositions. Selectivity of the <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> used in acoustic-based surveys of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) was evaluated using multiple methods. The effects of trawl selectivity on the acoustic-based survey abundance estimates and the stock assessment were evaluated for the Gulf of Alaska walleye pollock population. Selectivity was quantified using recapture, or pocket, nets attached to the outside of the trawl. Pocket net catches were modeled using a hierarchical Bayesian model to provide uncertainty in selectivity parameter estimates. Significant under-sampling of juvenile pollock by the <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> was found, with lengths at 50 % retention ranging from 14 - 26 cm over three experiments. Escapement was found to be light dependent, with more fish escaping in dark conditions. Highest escapement rates were observed in the aft of the trawl near to the codend though the bottom panel of the trawl. The behavioral mechanisms involved in the process of herding and escapement were evaluated using stereo-cameras, a DIDSON high frequency imaging sonar, and pocket nets. Fish maintained greater distances from the trawl panel during daylight, suggesting trawl modifications such as increased visibility of netting materials may evoke stronger herding responses and increased retention of fish. Selectivity and catchability of pollock by the <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> was also investigated using acoustic density as an independent estimate of fish abundance to compare with trawl catches. A modeling framework was developed to evaluate potential explanatory factors for selectivity and catchability. Selectivity estimates were dependent on which vessel was used for the survey, and the condition factor of the fish caught. Ambient water temperature, time of day, and the proportion of fish in spawning condition influenced model-derived estimates of catchability. Finally, the effect of trawl selectivity on the acoustic-based survey abundance estimate and Gulf of Alaska pollock assessment was evaluated. Survey biomass estimates were overestimated by up to 40 % as abundance of juvenile fish increased and adult abundance decreased. The increase in uncertainty in survey abundance estimates due to trawl selectivity had a measurable impact on the stock assessment, changing model estimates of fishing mortality, spawning biomass and recruitment by more than 10 %. The studies provide new methods for assessing selectivity, catchability and for observing fish behavior in <b>midwater</b> <b>trawls,</b> which can be used to evaluate <b>midwater</b> <b>trawls</b> used in other surveys...|$|R
