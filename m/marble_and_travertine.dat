50|$|Acid Attack. Acid-soluble stone {{materials}} such as the calcite in <b>marble,</b> limestone <b>and</b> <b>travertine,</b> {{as well as the}} internal cement that binds the resistant grains in sandstone, react with acidic solutions on contact, or on absorbing acid-forming gases in polluted air, such as oxides of sulfur or nitrogen. Acid erodes the stone, leaving dull marks on polished surfaces. In time it may cause deep pitting, eventually totally obliterating the forms of statues, memorials and other sculptures. Even mild household acids, including cola, wine, vinegar, lemon juice and milk, can damage vulnerable types of stone. The milder the acid, the longer it takes to etch calcite-based stone; stronger acids can cause irreparable damage in seconds.|$|R

Therefore, there are many benefits of taking measures for reducing the energy consumption. The aim of presented experimental study is to develop control methods to reduce energy consumption in marble cutting process. In the study, cutting experiments were performed with a fully computer controlled test rig for three natural rocks (Burdur beige <b>and</b> Usak green <b>marbles</b> <b>and</b> Afyon <b>travertine).</b> The experiments were carried out on two modes (manual and automatic). While travel speed is kept fixed in manual mode as usual in industry, it is controlled by a controller embedded closed control loop during the cutting process in automatic mode. Other machine parameters, such as sawblade rotation speed, cutting depth and flowing speed of cooling water, are kept fixed in all experiments. In designed closed control loop, PID and FL controllers widely used in industry were used to control travel speed. Obtained results show that if the travel speed is controlled during cutting process, energy saving can be ensured by of controllers for the three rocks...|$|R
5000|$|Passeri {{expressed}} {{here the}} traditional art historical {{view that the}} Bamboccianti paintings offered a realist [...] "true portrait of Rome and its popular life" [...] "without variation or alteration" [...] of what the artist sees. However, their contemporaries did not generally regard the Bamboccianti as realists. An alternative view {{of the art of}} the Bamboccianti is that their works should rather be seen as complex allegories which are a commentary on classical art with a view to bringing the observer to contemplate elevated ideas. They thus stand in a long tradition of paradox in which low or vulgar subjects were the vehicle for conveying important philosophical meanings. For instance, the Bamboccianti regularly made paintings of gigantic limekilns outside Rome. These limekilns used the <b>marble</b> <b>and</b> <b>travertine</b> blocks of the Roman antique ruins as raw material and thus played a direct role in the destruction of Rome's ancient monuments. The limekilns themselves are painted in a grandiose way {{as if they were the}} new monuments of Rome. The kilns created something new from the ruins of ancient Rome and the lime they produced was used in the construction of new monuments in Rome. The paintings of these limekilns can therefore be read as a reflection on the transience of glory as well as the regenerative power of Rome. In other words, these paintings were intended to be read ironically and allegorically (even as paradoxes) and not as exact, realist depictions of life in Rome.|$|E

Activity concentrations of 226 Ra, 232 Th, and 40 K were measured by the standard gamma-spectrometry system. The lowest content of the radionuclides was found in white marble (ARa = 2 Bq/kg, ATh < 2 Bq/kg, and AK < 3 Bq/kg), while the highest activities were in some granite samples (Balmoral red: ARa = 200 Bq/kg, ATh = 378 Bq/kg, and AK = 1679, and Madura Gold: ARa = 273 Bq/kg, ATh = 20 Bq/kg, and AK = 1456 Bq/kg). The indoor absorbed dose rate in air due to the gamma radiation from covering materials was determined based on the specific absorbed dose rate computed in this work. Concentration of 222 Rn that emanated into the indoor space was also calculated from the known 226 Ra content.

40|$|Turkey’s recent {{economic}} and financial crisis had begun in late 2000. It exploded in February 2001, {{a little more than}} a year into a 3 -year program to end Turkey’s three decades of double- and triple-digit inflation. The crisis included a significant devaluation of the lira and soaring interest rates. The country’s nominal gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated to be about $ 149 billion 1 in 2001 which was a 7. 4 % decline in real GDP compared with 2000 (International Monetary Fund, 2002 a§ 2, b§). Total mineral industry revenues (primary and secondary mineral commodity production including cement, glass, refined petroleum products, steel, and certain inorganic chemicals) were estimated to account for about 10 % of GDP. Turkey was one of the world’s major producer of barite, boron minerals, celestite (strontium), chromite, emery, feldspar, limestone, magnesite, marble, perlite, and pumice and a significant source of processed mineral commodities which included refined borates and related chemicals, cement, ceramics, glass, and steel. Trade The economic crisis diminished domestic mineral demand, which increased the attractiveness of minerals and mineral product exports. Total Turkish exports were valued at $ 31. 3 billion in 2001 compared with $ 27. 8 billion in 2000 (State Institute of Statistics, 2002 §). In 2001, exports of mineral and chemical-based commodities and products included iron and steel bars, which were valued at $ 866 million; mineral fuels, oils, and products, $ 435 million; jewelry, $ 427 million; steel billets, $ 336 million; steel pipe, $ 285 million; steel wire rod, $ 213 million; inorganic chemicals, $ 211 million; cold rolled flat steel, $ 163 million; hot rolled flat steel, $ 158 million; worked <b>marble</b> <b>and</b> <b>travertine,</b> $ 158 million; steel sections and profiles, $ 116 million; aluminum bars and profiles, $ 103 million; borates and concentrates, $ 101 million; and copper wire, $ 99 millio...|$|E

40|$|Uniaxial {{compressive}} strength (UCS) {{is considered to}} be one of the important parameters in rock engineering projects. In order to determine UCS, direct and indirect techniques are employed. In the direct approach, UCS is determined from the laboratory UCS test. In indirect techniques determine UCS based on the nondestructive test findings which can be easily and quickly performed and require relatively simple or no sample preparation. Indirect techniques are commonly preferred by rock and mining engineers because of their low cost and ease. This study presents the findings of an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based model for the prediction of UCS from Schmidt hardness. Schmidt hardness test (SHT) is a nondestructive test method which provides fairly good correlation about the strength of rocks. SHT can be easily and quickly conducted with a portable device known as Schmidt Hammer and it does not require any sample preparation. ANNs have been widely used in solving engineering problems and have emerged as powerful and versatile computational tools for organizing and correlating information in ways that have proved useful for solving certain types of problems too complex, too poorly understood, or too resource-intensive to tackle using more traditional numerical and statistical methods. For this reason, ANNs are used in this study to predict UCS of carbonate rocks from the Schmidt hardness rebound value (N R). A set of 37 test measurements obtained from 37 different carbonate rocks (<b>marble,</b> limestone, <b>and</b> <b>travertine)</b> are used to develop the ANN-based model. The results of the ANN model were also compared against the results of a regression model. The criteria used to evaluate the predictive performances of the models were the coefficient of determination (R 2), root mean square error (RMSE), and variance account for (VAF). The R 2, RMSE, VAF indices were calculated as 0. 39, 46. 51, 12. 45 for the regression model and 0. 96, 7. 92, 95. 84 for the ANN model, respectively. The results show that ANN-based model produces significantly better results than the regression model. It was concluded that the N R value is a useful indicator for the prediction of UCS from the ANN model developed in this study...|$|R
